This is the second Annual Report of the Committee 
of Governors, covering its 
activities and the monetary 
and financial conditions in the Community 
in 1992. The Report has been prepared in accordance 
with the Committee's mandate as laid down in 
the amended Council Decision of 12th 
March 1990. The past year has been one of the most challenging 
for co-operation among the 
central banks of the EEC Member States. Monetary 
and financial developments, especially 
those linked 
to the turbulence 
in the exchange markets 
in the second half of 1992, 
have dominated the 
work and the 
discussions in the Committee. 
At the same time, following the 
signing of the Treaty 
on European Union in 
Maastricht in February last year, the Committee 
has taken the first steps to establish 
the conditions for the implementation of the 
Treaty in the 
monetary field and, 
in particular, to prepare the establishment 
of the European Monetary 
Institute (EMI) 
which will 
take over the tasks of the Committee of Governors 
when it is dissolved at 
the end of 1993. 
1. MONETARY POLICY IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF EXCHANGE MARKET 
TENSIONS As pointed out 
in last year's Annual Report, when reviewing monetary policy 
intentions for 1992 in its annual forward-looking 
assessment, the Committee of Governors 
concluded that the monetary policies envisaged by the national authorities were geared 
towards a further decline in inflation in 
the Community. Although the average rate of increase 
in consumer prices fell 
in the Community from 5.1% in 1991 
to 4.3% in 1992, a 
more significant reduction would normally have 
been expected given the favourable external 
influences on inflation 
and the continued weakness 
of economic activity in the Community 
(see Table 1 and Chart 1). Output 
in the Community 
as a whole rose 
by only 1.1% in 1992, 
reflecting partly the unexpected prolongation 
of the downswing in the rest of the world, but 
also depressed domestic 
demand in most 
of the Member States. At the time 
of the annual assessment 
of national policy intentions 
the Committee had noted a number of 
potential risks, some of 
which in fact 
soon materialised: in particular, 
hopes for an early recovery 
of economic activity faded; plans for fiscal consolidation proved 
often difficult 
to realise; and labour costs continued to rise at a rather rapid pace in some 
countries. Moreover, accelerating monetary growth 
and persistent domestic price pressures 
made it necessary 
to tighten monetary policy at the end of 1991 in Germany. 
In the first part 
of 1992, monetary growth 
in the Community quickened and 
monetary aggregates deviated from 
their targeted 
paths in 
several countries. While 
interest- rate differentials remained small, 
the level 
of short-term interest 
rates tended to edge upwards. As economic activity remained sluggish, there were growing concerns about the

been made in containing inflation 
and where unemployment was increasing rapidly. 
A turning point 
was reached at 
the beginning of June 1992 
when the narrow 
Danish rejection of the 
Maastricht Treaty triggered growing unrest 
in the exchange markets 
of the Community. Money market conditions 
quickly became 
more differentiated. In Germany, 
the monetary stance remained 
firm and market interest rates did not ease before mid- 
September on the occasion 
of the realignment 
of the Italian lira. In Belgium and the 
Netherlands, changes 
in the central banks' 
intervention rates closely mirrored the movements 
in German interest rates 
to maintain 
the tight 
currency links with the Deutsche Mark. 
All other countries participating in the 
Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) were faced 
with - at times very severe - downward pressure 
on their currencies during the second half of the 
year and raised official interest rates, 
though to varying 
degrees and at 
different times, 
as part of 
their strategies to counter the emerging exchange rate tensions. 
The outcome of the Danish referendum 
in June was 
only a catalyst 
for the subsequent events 
which culminated in September 1992 in the most serious crisis of the 
European Monetary System 
(EMS) since its inception. In quick succession, two realignments 
were agreed and the obligation 
to respect the 
prescribed exchange 
rate margins was 
suspended for two currencies. 
Within a short period, the remarkable stability of exchange 
rate expectations of the past few years 
vanished and 
gave way to intense speculative behaviour. 
Initially, strong downward pressure 
was felt by currencies 
which appeared vulnerable 
in the light of domestic economic conditions. 
However, as tensions spread to other currencies, the 
situation in the exchange market 
also began to exhibit 
features of a speculative run with short- 
term, unwarranted exchange 
rate expectations feeding 
on themselves. 1987-89 average percentage 3.5 4.1 6.1 1990 change 2.8 5.7 7.6 1991 over the previous 1.2 5.1 7.1 per cent of 1992 (a) year 1.1 4.3 5.7 0.4 -3.6 nominal GDP -0.3 -4.2 9.6 9.4 -0.9 -4.7 -1.0

of the authorities to exchange rate tensions which were perceived as insufficiently co-ordinated. 
- 6 5 4 3 2 1 More fundamentally, the exchange market crisis must 
be ascribed to two factors. 
Firstly, the stability 
of nominal exchange rates 
in the ERM during the previous five years had 
0 not been exploited sufficiently 
to underpin 
the existing central parities 
by correcting economic imbalances and 
by more vigorous efforts towards greater economic convergence. 
On the contrary, owing 
to substantial budget 
deficits in a large number of Community 
Per cent 
7 7 countries, unbalanced policy-mixes 
had persisted and 
insufficient convergence to a 
low level of inflation had 
caused significant changes 
in international competitive positions. With signs 
of waning popular support for the Maastricht Treaty in the run-up 
to the French referendum, 
the markets' trust 
in the authorities' 
commitment to 
the existing central parities, and 
to the achievement of convergence 
in accordance with the Treaty's criteria, faded. 
The French referendum thus became a reference date for a possible realignment. 
The second basic reason for the exchange market crisis was that, in 
the course of 
1992, the prolonged weakness 
of economic activity and diminishing prospects 
for a recovery 
was increasingly felt 
to aggravate policy dilemmas for those countries where inflation had 
been reduced significantly 
and where 
labour market conditions had deteriorated sharply. 
In these cases, 
the level of nominal interest rates required 
to maintain the currency's central 
rate in the ERM was seen to 
be increasingly 
at odds with 
the needs 
of the domestic economy, 
especially as real interest rates rose 
with an improving outlook for inflation. 
The conflict between external and domestic objectives 
was highlighted by repeated calls 
for lower interest 
rates, both 
in the countries concerned 
and with respect to German rates, given the latter's 
importance for monetary conditions elsewhere 
in the Community. In Germany, however, it 
was felt that there was little scope for 
interest rate reductions, given price and 
wage developments and the 
fiscal stance. On the other hand, there were perceptions in markets that 
there were limits 
to the willingness 
of the authorities 
in some other countries 
to raise interest rates in the defence of 
central parities - especially where because of weak economic 
conditions and a high level 
of private andlor public debt the economies were very sensitive 
to changes in interest rates. 
All Community countries 
where currencies were subject 
to downward pressures 
made use, in varying combinations, 
of three instruments: the scope 
for movements in the 
ERM fluctuation bands 
was widely exploited; intervention was undertaken 
on an unprecedented scale; 
and interest rates 
were adjusted, though to 
different extents and 
at different times. Some countries 
tightened the 
administration of existing exchange controls 
while in one instance measures 
were temporarily applied to 
penalise the short-selling 
of the domestic currency financed 
through swaps. 
While the 
assessment of the recent turbulent events in the exchange markets has 
not yet been finalised, there 
is full agreement that 
the EMS, 
as an arrangement for the promotion of closer monetary 
co-operation leading 
to a zone 
of monetary stability, 
is beneficial to 
all Community countries 
and that the 
restoration and maintenance of the credibility of the System as a 
whole is a 
very important objective. In order 
to achieve this 
goal two 
requirements have 
to be fulfilled. Firstly, 
for central 
parities to remain credible, the 
underlying economic conditions have 
to be sound and need to 
be safeguarded convincingly 
by current and future macro-economic policies. The System must remain flexible, 
and exchange rate adjustments may be needed if major economic imbalances arise. However, a 
realignment is no panacea and does not, therefore, eliminate the need 
for supporting stability- 
oriented policies. Secondly, experience has 
shown that, in 
an environment of full freedom 
of capital movements, massive speculative exchange rate pressures may arise even in a situation 
when central parities are backed 
up by sound and stable domestic economic conditions. In 
such circumstances, the defence 
of exchange rates must rest 
on close co-operation consistent 
with the commitment of individual countries' monetary policies 
to price stability 
which is a precondition for lasting exchange rate stability. 
The institutional steps that are being taken in 
a number of Member States 
to increase the independence 
of their central bank could 
be a very helpful element in enhancing the credibility 
of monetary policy. Within these broad 
considerations, the Committee 
of Governors is continuing its discussions 
on the management 
of the 
EMS. 2. MONETARY POLICY ORIENTATIONS FOR 1993 When in December 
1992 the Committee 
of Governors assessed national monetary 
policy intentions for 1993, not 
only was there a highly uncertain outlook 
for the world 
economy, and for growth and inflationary pressures 
in the Community, but renewed 
outbreaks of tension 
in the exchange markets indicated that more lasting calm had not yet 
been restored in the EMS. 
Real GDP in the 
Community was 
forecast to expand at roughly the 
same low rate as 
in the 
two preceding years, and 
despite the weakness of activity inflation 
was still 
expected to recede only moderately. There was full agreement 
in the Committee 
of Governors that monetary policies 
must continue 
to be geared towards the 
medium-term goal 
of achieving and maintaining price 
stability throughout the Community. 
Monetary policy 
can only fulfil 
this objective if 
managed with a steady hand. 
As experience has shown, the benefits 
to economic activity 
from a premature easing 
of monetary conditions 
are quickly eroded and are soon outweighed 
by significant longer-term economic 
costs, which are difficult 
and painful to absorb. For this 
reason the Committee of Governors emphasised the need 
for a medium-term oriented 
monetary policy 
which ensures a further 
decline in inflation without restraining the 
room for 
a sustainable recovery of economic activity. 
However, as stressed in last year's Annual 
Report, the effectiveness of the 
envisaged monetary stance hinges to 
an important extent 
on adequate support from fiscal 
policy and wage developments. There 
is an urgent need to improve the mix between fiscal 
and monetary policies in a number 
of Member 
States. Despite 
the less favourable economic 
prospects for 1993, sight should not be lost 
of the need for fiscal consolidation. 
This is 
particularly important 
in the light 
of the Maastricht Treaty, 
which states the need for fiscal discipline and establishes a reference 
value for the budget deficit of 
3% of 
GDP to help assess 
the sustainability of the 
government's financial 
position. According 
to the latest published 
forecast by the European Commission, the budget deficit 
in the Community 
as a whole 
is projected to increase 
to 5%% of GDP 
in 1993, up by half a percentage point on last 
year's already unsustainably high level. 
If the credibility of Member countries' policies and 
Treaty obligations are 
to be maintained and overburdening 
of monetary policies 
is to be avoided, the 
necessary measures towards budgetary 
consolidation must be taken now. In particular, in 
countries with excessive budget deficits, efforts 
to correct structural deficits 
must be 
intensified. In other countries, 
subdued economic growth 
should not result 
in increases in 
deficits beyond the normal automatic effects from declining revenues and higher social 
expenditure. Furthermore, 
while some Community countries succeeded in containing nominal 
wage growth in 1992, a significant moderation 
in wage increases is still needed where labour 
costs rise 
at a rapid pace. 
In addition, all Community 
countries must persevere 
with their efforts to reduce structural rigidities in labour markets. To promote the necessary policy 
adjustments, national convergence programmes have 
been set in most countries following 
discussions at Community level. 
The importance of achieving quickly a better balance between fiscal 
and monetary policies, 
and of strengthening supply-side policies, 
was dramatically highlighted 
by the disappointing economic 
and financial 
developments in 1992. Decisive progress in these 
fields is required not only 
to strengthen 
the foundations 
for sustained growth but 
also to 
restore stable exchange 
rate relationships among Community currencies. 
While monetary policy remains the 
responsibility of the national authorities, the strengthening of monetary 
policy co-ordination within the Committee 
of Governors should also contribute to 
the re- establishment of the credibility 
of the ERM without which it will be much more difficult to narrow interest 
rate differentials on a lasting basis. 
The recent realignments 
and movements in the exchange rates 
of currencies which have suspended their 
ERM commitment should have helped 
to correct the effects 
of past imbalances. However, the changes in 
exchange rates, and in particular the temporary floating 
of currencies, should not be misconstrued as having eliminated the constraints 
on domestic economic policies. 
The close integration 
of the Community economies, and the growing 
interdependencies arising from the 
completion of the single market 
for people, goods, 
services and capital, leave no alternative 
to co-operation and closely co-ordinated policies. 
3. PREPARATORY WORK FOR 
THE MOVE TO 
STAGES TWO AND THREE OF ECONOMIC 
AND MONETARY UNION 
In response 
to the invitation 
by the Council of the European Communities, the 
Committee of Governors has 
set in motion preparatory work to 
establish the conditions for 
the implementation 
of the Treaty 
of Maastricht in the monetary field. 
This work is focusing partly on the task 
of setting up the European Monetary 
Institute and partly on certain specific 
areas which are linked 
to the more distant goal of a single monetary policy but 
which require a considerable period of preparation. 
The groundwork for the 
EM1 has so far centred primarily 
on the tasks of this new 
institution. Some of these tasks overlap 
with responsibilities currently assigned to the 
Committee of Governors, 
such as the 
co-ordination of monetary policies, 
or to the European 
Monetary Co-operation Fund, 
such as the administration of the EMS mechanisms. In these 
areas, the objective 
is to ensure a 
smooth transition 
to the EMI. In addition, the Committee 
of Governors is currently considering 
how the EM1 should best perform its operational 
functions. According 
to the EM1 Statute, these include: functions currently undertaken by the 
EMCF; new functions 
such as the 
management of foreign exchange reserves as agent of 
and at the request of national 
central banks; 
and tasks related to the ECU. 
With regard to preparatory work with a long lead time, the Committee 
of Governors has identified five major areas 
which deserve early 
attention: statistics, payment 
system questions, printing and issuing 
a European bank-note, accounting issues, 
and the 
establishment of information systems. For 
each of 
these specific projects 
new Working Groups have 
been established. 
The initial work 
of these groups 
is mainly of a fact-finding and 
stock-taking nature in order 
to prepare the ground for future decisions 
on how to create the necessary integrated infrastructures. Finally, preliminary work 
has also commenced with 
a view to clarifying the main questions relating 
to the principal features, instruments and 
operating procedures of the future single monetary policy. 
The first chapter 
of the Report reviews economic developments and monetary 
policy implementation in 
1992. In the second chapter, monetary policy 
instruments and procedures are described, while 
the third chapter surveys the institutional 
features of Community central banks. 
The final chapter reports 
on the activities 
of the Committee of Governors and 
the preparation for the move 
to Economic and Monetary Union. 
I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND MONETARY POLICY 
IMPLEMENTATION 1. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND TO MONETARY POLICY After a vigorous expansion in the late 
1980s, economic growth in the Community 
slowed sharply in 199 
1 and remained sluggish in 1992. 
The weakness in activity reflected the 
impact of 
an unfavourable external environment combined 
with subdued domestic demand. 
On average, inflation 
in Community countries declined further in 1992 although the situation 
remains far 
from the medium-term 
goal of 
price stability. Moreover, the extent of the decline 
in inflation was rather limited 
in spite of the marked weakness in EC import prices and 
more modest output growth 
than earlier envisaged. The resilience 
of inflation stems largely from 
domestic sources, 
with particularly strong price increases in the sectors of the economy 
sheltered from international competition. While differences in inflation rates between 
Community countries narrowed further 
in 1992, this was in part attributable 
to a decline in 
the United Kingdom 
and to 
a rise in 
Germany, traditionally a low inflation country. 
1.1 External environment Growth in the Community's 
main export markets improved only slightly in 1992, 
disappointing earlier expectations 
of a stronger external stimulus. 
In the US, output continued 
to pick up, although the pace 
of growth was significantly less 
than is normal at this stage of 
the cycle and the recovery 
appeared fragile at times. In the light 
of the mixed signals 
regarding the strength 
and durability of the upturn, the 
Federal Reserve eased monetary 
policy on a number of occasions during the year. The uncertainties concerning 
the relative strength of the upswing in the 
US, and 
therefore the future 
path of interest rates, contributed 
to significant dollar volatility. Signs 
of strong growth 
in the early months of 1992 
led to 
a marked rise in the dollar, but as 
the recovery 
faltered and US 
monetary policy 
was loosened further, the dollar depreciated vis-a-vis the Deutsche 
Mark by some 15% between end-April 
and end-August. Thereafter, the dollar firmed 
by about 14% up to the end of 1992, following 
evidence of 
a stronger revivzl in the US and the reductions 
in German interest rates in 
September (see Chart 
2). In Japan, growth decelerated significantly during 1992 
with asset prices falling 
sharply. In response, monetary policy 
was eased further and a major package 
of expansionary budgetary measures 
was announced 
in August. EFTA countries, 
which absorb around one 
quarter of the Community's exports 
to the rest of the world, remained in recession in 1992, 
reflecting the impact 
of high real 
interest rates 
and of depressed global demand. 
Non-oil commodity prices were little 
changed on average in dollar terms in 1992 
while oil prices were 
also relatively soft. 
Weak raw materials prices, together 
with slack demand conditions, contributed 
to a deceleration in inflation internationally. 
In addition, the 
general appreciation of Community exchange rates against non-Community currencies over 
much of 
the year helped 
to dampen 
inflationary pressures in the Community. Indeed, import 
prices fell 
in six Member States, while in the others the rise 
was less than that 
of the GDP deflator. 1.2 Economic performance and convergence 
in the Community 
GDP growth continued to be subdued in 1992, decelerating marginally 
to 1.1 
% in the EC as a whole (see Table 
R1 on page 34). The sluggishness 
of activity in 
part reflected the continuation of 
the global downswing noted above. In addition to 
the slowdown in external demand, domestic 
demand in the Community 
was also depressed 
as a result of a retrenchment in private investment and consumer spending. Consumer and business 
confidence deteriorated against a 
background of high real interest rates 
in most 
Community countries. A slowdown was particularly evident in Germany where, after a buoyant first 
quarter, activity 
in the western part of the country decreased over 
the remainder of the 
year while in 
the eastern part there 
was only 
a modest rebound. Slackening demand 
growth in Germany contributed 
to the protraction 
of the downturn elsewhere in the Community, in 
significant contrast 
to the strong boost 
to trade in the wake of unification. 
Of the other 
countries which had grown relatively rapidly 
in 1991, Spain and the Netherlands experienced 
a significant deceleration. In contrast, there 
was a modest upturn 
in France due mainly to a 
strong export performance, although growth 
remained well below potential. 
Elsewhere in the Community, 
activity continued to be very weak. In particular, in 
the United Kingdom high levels 
of private debt combined with falling property prices 
contributed to a further contraction 
in output, albeit smaller than in 1991 
(see Box 1 overleaf). The depressed economic environment 
in the Community adversely affected labour 
markets conditions and, as a result, 
unemployment increased in nearly all Member States 
touching 10% 
on average by the 
end of 
the year (see Table R2 on page 34). Although differences in growth performance 
between Community countries were somewhat less 
pronounced than in the previous 
year, the dispersion between 
the levels of actual and trend 
output widened further in 1992 (see Table 
2). TABLE 2: OUTPUT GAPS

of inflation in the Community fell further 
from 5.1% 
in 1991 to 
4.3% in 1992 (see 
Table R3). The relative resilience 
of inflation stemmed largely 
from increases in domestic costs 
and from price 
rises in the non-traded goods and services sectors 
of the national economies where competitive pressures are generally less powerful (see Box 
2 on page 14). Although nominal wage growth 
moderated in the Community 
as a whole, 
it remained above 
5% in most 
Community countries 
(see Table R4). In addition, profit margins 
continued to widen 
in a number 
of Member States. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes 
or in charges for- public services 
added to upward 
pressure on consumer prices, 
in particular in Germany, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands 
and Portugal. The dispersion of inflation rates 
in the Community narrowed again in 1992. 
However, as in the previous 
year, this narrowing 
was partly due 
to an increase in Germany, 
where inflation averaged 
4% in the western part of the country, as against 
3.5% in 1991. In 
the eastern part, price increases were 
significantly higher following the adjustment of rents 
and other prices 
which brought them closer 
to market levels. 
In contrast, inflation 
fell substantially in the United Kingdom, from 5.9% 
to 3.7%, as the recession was prolonged

INDEBTEDNESS IN EEC COUNTRIES The structure 
of household 
and corporate balance 
sheets has important implications for the 
behaviour of consumer spending and investment 
and for the responsiveness of 
aggregate demand to changes 
in interest rates. Evidence suggests that there are significant 
variations in private debt levels across 
Community countries. Levels of 
personal sector indebtedness in the UK are significantly in excess of those in other 
EEC countries. Having risen 
strongly in the 
1980s against a background of 
financial deregulation, 
buoyant income expectations and strongly 
rising asset 
prices, personal sector debt in the 
UK amounted to 78% of 
gross income in 1990. Much of 
this short and long-term borrowing 
was at variable interest rates. In contrast, 
personal borrowing amounted to 
45% of income 
in France and 
37% in Germany. 
In both countries, 
most lending is long-term and at 
fixed rates. One consequence of the high 
personal sector debt ratio in the 
UK - which in 
1990 was exacerbated 
by high nominal interest 
rates - is a level of interest payments relative 
to income well 
in excess of levels 
elsewhere in the Community and substantially 
above the levels recorded 
at the late 1970s 
(see graph below) l. Personal Sector Interest Payments

housing wealth 
- an important 
component of household wealth 
- have also varied considerably. 
In Germany, house prices have increased 
significantly in recent years, rising 
by about 30% since 1986. In France, prices 
have fallen somewhat in 1991 and 1992, after strong growth in earlier 
years. In the 
UK, the combination 
of high interest 
rates and 
subdued activity has resulted 
in sharp falls 
in house prices, which have declined 
by around 14% since the 
1989 peak. Over 1 million households are 
now in a situation where the 
value of 
their property is less than 
the mortgage outstanding. Continued ... In 1990, levels 
of indebtedness in the non-jinancial corporate sectors 
amounted to 332% of sector income in France, 
206% in Germany and 144% in the UK. These variations reflect a number 
of economic and institutional characteristics, including the relative popularity 
of debt versus equity financing. 
There are sharp variations 
in ratios of interest payments to corporate income 
in Community countries (see 
graph below), ranging 
from 53% in Portugal to 
24% in the UK. While these 
data provide useful information, 
it should be recalled that in most Community countries (excluding the 
UK and Ireland), the bulk 
of corporate borrowing is at fixed interest rates.

by the data presented above. 
It appears that tie combination of high debt 
and falling house prices 
in the UK has resulted in a less 'healthy' household balance 
sheet than in other 
EEC countries. This, together 
with the prevalence 
of variable rate 
lending, suggests that 
household expenditures are likely to 
be relatively more responsive in the 
UK to changes in interest rates. 
Moreover, it appears that efforts 
by households in the UK to strengthen their balance sheets 
by restraining expenditures and reducing debt have contributed 
to the weakness of activity. 
For other EEC countries there is 
little evidence that household balance sheet restructuring has 
made a significant contribution 
to the behaviour 
of consumption in recent years. 
In relation to the corporate sector, there are significant variations in the level 
of debt and interest payments, implying that the impact of interest rate changes varies significantly across 
Community countries. 
It is 
also worth noting that the widespread practice 
of fixed rate lending in many 
countries with high debt ratios may insulate 
both households and firms somewhat 
from the effects of 
changes in short-term interest rates. 
In the above 
charts, data for Belgium and Portugal refer 
to 1979 and 1989; for Spaln to 1981 and 1990; for Italy to 
1980 and 1988. Box 2: SECTORAL INFLATION TRENDS A striking feature 
of recent price developments 
in most Community countries has 
been the wide divergence between inflation rates 
in the sectors producing goods 
traded on international markets and 
in those producing predominantly domestically 
consumed goods and 
services which are more sheltered 
from competition (see Table 
below). Considerable progress has 
been made 
in recent years towards 
convergence on low inflation in the 
traded goods sector, in 
an environment of increasing competition 
in world markets. Tentative evidence 
suggests, however, that this may partly reflect 
a persistent squeeze in profit margins 
or in relative wages in 
some countries, which may 
prove difficult to 
sustain over 
the medium-term. 
Inflation rates in the 
more sheltered sector 
are generally well above those 
in the traded goods 
sector, particularly in the countries 
with higher average inflation. Indeed, for the Community 
as a whole 
the differential between the two rates 
was around the highest 
level for ten years 
in 1992. Prices of non-traded 
goods typically rise faster 
than traded goods: productivity 
is generally lower, reflecting differences in 
production technology and in 
the degree of competition in the two sectors. 
Moreover, shifts in the pattern of 
demand towards greater 
consumption of 
services as income increases may also influence relative 
price movements. In some countries, 
however, the sizeable gap 
between the sectoral inflation rates, taken together 
with the greater resilience 
of inflation in the 
sheltered sector, suggests the presence of 
structural problems 
which are hampering the reduction 
of inflation. In these countries, 
policy measures to strengthen competition 
and raise productivity levels in 
the more sheltered sector 
would consequently enhance the effectiveness 
of monetary and fiscal policies in 
promoting price 
stability. DIFFERENCE IN INFLATION TRENDS IN THE NON-TRADED AND TRADED GOODS SECTORS (a) -- (a9 National proxies supplied by central banks. As prox~es dlffer, cross-counfq comparlsons and the

Of the other countries with relatively high inflation 
in 1991, there were also significant reductions 
in Greece, Italy 
and Portugal, but 
the rate 
of price 
increase was unchanged in Spain, 
with the 3 percentage points rise in the 
rate of VAT 
offsetting an improvement in the inflation rate before tax. 
In the remaining countries, where 
in recent years inflation 
has been relatively low, a 
slight decline was recorded. 
For the Community as a 
whole, public finances 
deteriorated in 1992, with the 
overall ratio of general government borrowing 
to GDP 
rising to 
5.3% from 4.7% 
in the 
previous year (see Table R5). The increase in the budget deficit was particularly striking in 
the United Kingdom, where the 
deficit more than doubled to over 
6% of GDP, mainly 
as a result of adverse 
cyclical influences on revenue and expenditures but also reflecting a 
discretionary boost 
by the authorities. 
In Germany, the deficit 
was broadly unchanged at 
nearly 4% of GDP, 
with the ongoing 
costs of unification continuing 
to fuel budgetary 
pressure. In addition, there 
was significant borrowing by state-linked entities, 
such as the Treuhand, totalling some 
2% of GDP in 1992. The 
slowdown in German growth 
is adding to the difficulties of rebalancing the policy mix. 
In Italy, although some reduction 
in the budget 
deficit was achieved, the fall 
was much less than originally planned partly due 
to adverse cyclical factors. In view 
of the urgent need 
to restore sound public finances, a major package 
of budgetary measures 
was approved towards the 
end of the year. Although many of the 
measures are of a structural nature, further retrenchment 
will be needed in the medium-term 
to achieve an adequate degree 
of fiscal consolidation. Elsewhere in the Community changes 
in the level 
of public sector deficits were more muted. 
Of the other countries 
with high deficits, reductions in the 
level of borrowing were recorded in Greece, Spain and Portugal, 
while there were modest increases 
in Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg 
and the Netherlands. In the countries 
with high 
levels of public debt, debt-GDP 
ratios rose in Belgium, Greece, Italy 
and the Netherlands, but dropped further in Ireland (see Chart 
3). After the marked narrowing in 
current account 
imbalances in earlier years, the 
dispersion across Member States 
in 1992 was a little 
wider than 
in the previous year, albeit 
remaining at a relatively low 
level by recent historic standards (see 
Table R6). In most countries, current account balances 
were little changed. Notable developments 
in 1992 were a 
further rise in the surplus in Denmark 
and Ireland, a move into slight surplus in France and 
the near elimination 
of the deficit 
in Portugal, and a widening in the deficits in Greece, Spain, 
Italy and 
the United Kingdom. Overall, 
the Community's current account deficit 
vis-A-vis the rest of the world remained unchanged, 
at 1% of GDP. By the end of 1992, 
all Community countries had abolished controls 
on capital movements in 
line with Community legislation, 
except Greece which has a derogation.

in 1992 were set to 
promote a further decline in 
inflation, in line with the common objective of the monetary authorities in 
the Community to foster 
convergence towards price stability. Although national economic conditions 
in the Community continue 
to vary considerably, with a substantial divergence 
in cyclical positions 
and in cost and price 
pressures, the growing financial interdependence among 
ERM members has significantly 
reduced the scope for 
monetary policy differentiation. Given the pivotal 
role of German 
monetary policy 
in shaping monetary conditions 
in the Community, the restrictive stance 
required to contain strong inflationary pressures 
in Germany has set 
the general tone of monetary conditions 
throughout the area. In countries with low or rapidly falling inflation and 
weak economic activity, this has worsened the conflict between internal 
and external policy 
objectives, as the 
policy stance necessary 
to preserve exchange rate stability 
has often been 
tighter than desired given domestic economic conditions. 
In the second half 
of the year, policy dilemmas were exacerbated 
by unprecedented tensions in 
the ERM as market participants 
became increasingly concerned 
that exchange rate 
adjustments might prove inevitable 
given the lack of adequate convergence 
and the perceived policy conflicts confronting governments. 
The defence of parities in the presence of speculative attacks 
at times became the 
overriding concern in the setting 
of national monetary conditions. 
Policy responses to exchange rate pressures led to a substantial 
widening of interest-rate differentials 
vis-i-vis Germany. The greater freedom 
to set monetary 
policies in 
line with domestic conditions 
in Italy and the United Kingdom, following the 
suspension of ERM participation in mid-September was used to reduce short-term interest 
rates. In the United Kingdom, rates 
were cut to well below German levels while in Italy the 
reductions led 
to a marked narrowing 
of the differential 
with German rates. 
In this section, the monetary 
stance is assessed first through a brief description 
of developments in monetary aggregates 
and of 
the broad trends in interest rates. Attention 
then moves to exchange rate developments, which, as noted 
above, have exerted a major influence 
on the evolution of national monetary conditions in 1992. 
2.1 Monetary developments Monetary aggregates In the Community, the 
growth of broad money aggregates had slowed 
considerably during 1990 
and 1991, 
reflecting the tight stance 
of monetary policy 
and the deceleration of nominal 
demand growth. After an upturn in the pace 
of money expansion 
in the first half 
of 1992 in a number 
of countries, there 
were renewed signs 
of an 
underlying slowdown later in the 
year as nominal spending continued 
to slacken. In most countries 
setting quantified objectives, 
outturns were within or close to 
the target ranges 
(see Table 
3). In contrast, broad money grew strongly 
in Germany in 1992, particularly in the autumn, and 
the target was overshot significantly. 
For the year 
as a whole, monetary growth 
in the Community was similar 
to l991 (see Table 
R7). In Germany, monetary 
growth continued to 
accelerate in 1992, mainly 
as a result 
of rapid credit expansion. The 
widespread availability of interest-rate subsidies, particularly 
those granted for investment 
in eastern Germany, 
contributed to the strong credit demand. 
The exceptional demand for currency, 
and the incentive 
to hold short-dated liquid assets 
because short-term rates 
exceeded long term yields 
(an inverted yield curve), also exerted 
expansionary influences on the monetary aggregate. In the second half 
of the year, the huge 
capital inflows associated 
with the exchange market crisis led to a further increase 
in the growth of the money supply, 
although this movement 
was partially reversed in November 
and December. In the other countries setting 
monetary targets, developments were influenced 
by a variety 
of special factors. Portfolio shifts were important 
in France, where the money 
supply was temporarily boosted 
by the increase in the return 
on the interest-bearing assets 
included in the broad aggregate relative 
to the assets excluded, and in Spain, where in contrast 
portfolio movements were directed towards assets outside the definition 
of the broad aggregate. In Italy, credit 
demand in the first 
half year was 
strong, ultimately linked to the 
high fiscal deficit; credit 
to the private sector decelerated sharply in the second half, reflecting 
the rise 
in interest rates 
and slower 
economic growth. In Portugal, there were particularly 
large capital inflows in the period before 
ERM entry in April. In 
the United Kingdom, 
the narrow money 
aggregate remained in the target range during 1992, while broad money 
growth fell 
to historically low rates reflecting the stagnation 
of domestic activity. In 
all these countries, however, considerable downward exchange rate pressures were experienced in 
the second half-year which were typically accompanied 
by capital outflows, dampening monetary 
growth. TABLE 3: MONETARY AGGREGATES: TARGETS AND OUTTURNS (a) A. Countries setting targets for

In the early months 
of 1992, short-term interest rates in 
the Community were 
generally higher than in 
the second half 
of 1991 (see Chart 4). In December 1991, interest 
rates had 
been raised 
in Germany to counter rising inflationary pressure. With the exception 
of the UK, the upward move 
in German interest rates prompted similar 
moves in all countries participating in the 
ERM in order to preserve exchange rate stability. Nevertheless, 
the rise was at variance with the prevailing conditions 
of weak economic activity and

in several countries. Thus, 
in the spring, 
when exchange rate conditions permitted, there were 
small reductions in official interest rates in a number of countries, and 
in France 
reserve requirements were cut 
to reduce the 
cost of credit. Consequently, short-term 
interest rate differentials against the 
Deutsche Mark continued to narrow following the trend 
of the previous years. However, as differentials had already fallen 
to historically low levels, there was little 
room for 
any additional decline 
in interest rates 
given that market participants 
considered that German rates 
tended to set the floor 
to rates in the Community, 
on the assumption that the Deutsche 
Mark would remain 
the hardest currency. 
In this period, long- 
term rates generally declined a little, leading 
to steeper 
inversions of the national yield curves 
(see Chart 5). Conditions changed in the 
summer months. In July, the Bundesbank signalled its 
concern about the continued 
acceleration in monetary growth and the persistence 
of inflationary pressure by raising 
the discount 
rate by 
0.75%, while leaving 
the Lombard and 
rep0 rates unchanged to limit the impact 
on other Community 
countries (see Chart 
6). Money market rates in Germany rose 
only marginally, but the markets apparently interpreted the 
Bundesbank's decision 
as a sign that there were no prospects of 
an early lowering 
of interest rates in other 
ERM countries. Indeed, 
over this period 
the difficulty 
in pursuing internal and 
external policy objectives intensified as market confidence 
in the preservation of central 
exchange rate parities diminished. 
Against the background 
of broadly unchanged interest 
rates in Germany, the Netherlands 
and Belgium, 
short and long-term market interest rates 
rose in 
the other Community countries reflecting the 
additional currency risk. Official interest 
rates were raised 
in some countries, 
most substantially in Italy where exchange 
rate pressures were most acute. In the 
late months of 1992, the strains 
developed into a major exchange rate crisis 
which is described in detail 
in the following section. Monetary conditions were tightened 
in the countries where currencies 
faced downward pressure, 
although the degree and the timing 
of such tightening varied from 
country to 
country. The rise in short-term market interest rates 
was accompanied by 
an increase in long-term rates. In contrast, monetary conditions eased 
slightly in the countries 
where currencies were under upward pressure 
as exchange rate appreciation was expected 
to dampen external 
influences on inflation. Between the first 
realignment and the end of September, short-term market 
rates in Germany fell by around 
l%, with similar reductions 
in Belgium and the Netherlands. Long-term interest rates 
in these countries fell in 
line with short-term 
rates and dropped 
to their lowest level since 1989. In this 
period, interest-rate differentials 
within the Community widened 
considerably at both the 
short and 
long ends. After the departure 
of sterling from the ERM, official interest rates 
in the United 
Kingdom were reduced 
in successive steps by 4 percentage points from the level prevailing 
before the exchange rate turmoil. Slow monetary growth, falling property prices 
and subdued economic activity were 
seen as indications that monetary conditions could 
be eased without

price stability. Long-term yields fell much less, 
and as a result 
the yield curve became 
positively sloping. Official rates were cut by a broadly similar 
amount in Italy from the 
exceptional levels reached prior to the initial realignment of the lira, 
but in contrast to the 
UK, market rates remained 
around the levels of early 1992. 
2.2 Exchange rate developments 
Underlying factors The ERM had experienced a 
period of five years without a general realignment. 
Tensions had occurred from time 
to time 
but they had been 
successfully countered by the 
authorities. Exchange 
rate stability was maintained 
in spite of a number of factors 
which might have 
been expected 
to generate more severe strains 
within the mechanism 
in recent years. In particular: - further convergence 
towards a low 
level of 
inflation proved difficult to achieve. 
Relatively high rates of price 
and wage growth, in combination 
with unchanged nominal 
exchange rates, resulted in significant losses 
in international competitiveness in some 
Community countries; 
- cyclical divergences 
became more pronounced. Economic activity in most 
Community countries 
was very weak in 
1991 and has shown little sign of recovery since then. 
In contrast, strong economic 
growth continued 
in Germany after unification and 
has slowed down sharply only in 
1992; - after German unification, a sharp rise 
in demand, fuelled 
by a major increase 
in the budget deficit, 
and strong wage growth, led 
to a build-up of inflationary pressure 
which was countered by a tightening 
of the monetary stance. The unbalanced policy mix pushed 
German interest rates 
up and thus reduced 
the scope for other 
ERM participants to lower their 
rates in response 
to domestic economic conditions; 
- fiscal consolidation 
fell short 
of expectations in many Community countries. 
As a result, substantial differentiation 
in fiscal stances 
persisted, leading 
to an overburdening of monetary policy; 
- wide fluctuations 
occurred in the 
exchange rates of the dollar and the 
yen. Volatility in international currency markets 
often tends 
to exert pressures 
on intra-Community exchange rates given the differences 
in the importance of extra-Community trade 
to the individual Member States 
and the differences 
in the depth and liquidity of national financial 
markets and 
in the importance 
of Community currencies in international portfolios. 
Prior to June 1992, the 
impact of these factors on exchange rates had 
been outweighed by market confidence in the commitment 
of the authorities to the 
hard currency option. Markets expected that the 
process towards 
EMU would foster economic convergence 
in the Community through 
domestic adjustment 
measures and, thus, that imbalances would be 
eliminated without the need for a 
realignment in the ERM. However, a change in market 
sentiment occurred after the 
outcome of the Danish referendum. Rising uncertainty 
surrounding the French referendum on 20th September raised further doubts regarding the 
ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the 
completion of EMU and thus of 
the effective implementation of convergence measures. Market attention concentrated 
more and more on existing imbalances 
and policy dilemmas 
which endangered the prospects 
for economic convergence. Market operators focused initially 
on the currencies of countries where 
such imbalances and dilemmas were most acute, 
although pressures subsequently extended to other 
currencies. In an environment where 
financial market integration and deregulation provided 
scope for capital movements 
of an 
unprecedented size, the tensions developed into a major 
exchange market crisis, leading 
to three realignments in the 
late months of 1992 
and the suspension of the pound sterling 
and the Italian 
lira from the ERM. 
A fourth realignment 
was agreed in early 1993. 
Exchange rate movements 
In the early months 
of 1992, the 
situation remained relatively calm in the 
ERM. Participation in the mechanism 
was extended 
on 6th April when 
the Portuguese escudo joined 
the wide band. For most of the period, the British pound was 
in a relatively weak position 
against the Spanish peseta and, shortly after its entrance, 
also against the Portuguese escudo, 
but markets did not seriously 
test the lower limit. 
In the narrow band, the Deutsche Mark, 
the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder moved from the upper part towards the centre and the 
French franc strengthened from near the bottom 
of the band (see Chart 
7). Conditions changed dramatically following the 
Danish referendum on 2nd June. 
The change in market sentiment 
led to 
a distinct shift 
in investors' preferences. 
In the months 
between the 
Danish and 
the French referenda, downward pressure focused, 
in particular, on the Italian lira, 
which fell to the floor 
of the narrow band despite heavy intramarginal 
intervention and increases 
in interest rates. In addition, the three currencies of the wide band 
depreciated markedly against the 
Deutsche Mark, the Belgian franc, 
and the Dutch guilder, 
although the Portuguese 
escudo and 
the Spanish peseta remained for most of the time close 
to the top of the band while the 
pound sterling was close to 
its lower limit. At the same time, 
pressures developed 
also on the Nordic currencies 
which were unilaterally pegged to the 
ECU. The approaching French referendum and the possibility 
of a negative outcome 
suggested by a number of polls 
cast new 
doubts on the prospects 
of EMU. The fixed date 
of the referendum provided a catalyst 
to exchange rate pressures 
as market participants 
considered that a realignment 
was almost 
inevitable in the event of a "no" vote. Repeated 
official statements (on 
28th August by the ECOFIN Council and 
on 5th September 
at the conclusion of the informal ECOFIN meeting 
in Bath) that a realignment would not 
be the appropriate response 
to the prevailing strains failed 
to have a lasting impact on market 
expectations. Tensions were heightened 
by the sharp 
drop in the 
US dollar in the summer 
months and the suspension 
of the ECU peg 
of the Finnish markka on 8th September.

I ' I' I -l - SZT S9 09 33331f) VI3CvaxE) SIT SOT - - - - - Pressures continued 
to be most severe 
on the Italian lira, linked partly to delays in 
putting together the long-awaited structural 
fiscal adjustment measures. Despite a significant 
increase in Italian official rates 
and a rise in 
very short-term market rates above 
30%, the Italian lira had 
to be supported repeatedly 
by heavy intervention at the margin against the 
Deutsche Mark, the Belgian 
franc and the Dutch guilder. The situation became unsustainable. 
A devaluation of 3.5% of the Italian lira 
and a revaluation 
of 3.5% of the other currencies was 
decided on 13th September. This 
step was accompanied 
by a small cut 
in official interest 
rates in Germany which was 
followed by Belgium and 
the Netherlands. 
These exchange rate 
and interest rate measures were not sufficient to convince the 
markets that the new parity grid 
was sustainable. On 16th September, the pound sterling, the 
Spanish peseta and the Portuguese 
escudo came under intense pressure, and 
the Italian lira was again under severe strain. In the 
United Kingdom, 
interest rates were raised twice on this 
date but this proved ineffective 
in stemming the tide, as the new interest 
rate level was 
considered unsustainable 
by the market under prevailing domestic economic conditions, and 
the pound sterling had 
to be supported by large interventions 
at the fluctuation margin. 
At the end of the day, British membership 
of the ERM was suspended and the interest 
rate increases were reversed. 
On the same day, the 
Spanish peseta fell by some 
4% but remained above the 
permitted floor. 
An emergency Monetary Committee meeting 
was held in the evening 
of 16th September, at which 
the Italian authorities announced that they would temporarily 
abstain from intervention in the foreign exchange market. 
Against a background of 
continuing tensions in the 
ERM, and in particular in 
view of the new situation created by the 
withdrawal of the British pound 
and the Italian lira, the 
Spanish authorities requested a 
5% devaluation of the peseta 
which was 
agreed at 
the same meeting. After the 
second realignment, in the run-up to 
the French referendum, tensions 
spread to other currencies, 
with strong fundamentals, namely the French 
franc, the Danish 
krone and the Irish pound. 
As a result, authorities intervened in foreign exchange markets and 
tightened monetary conditions, in some cases 
very sharply. As tensions continued, and 
even increased after the French referendum, the French 
and German 
authorities issued a joint 
statement that no change in the 
French franc1Deutsche Mark central 
rate was justified. 
Backing this statement, the Banque de 
France raised a 
key interest rate by 
2.5 percentage points and brought about a sharp 
upward movement in short-term market interest rates, and 
the Deutsche Bundesbank 
and the Banque de France conducted concerted intra-marginal 
intervention operations. 
At the same time, since tensions in the peseta market had resurfaced, 
the Spanish authorities 
decided to introduce temporarily measures penalising the short-selling 
of pesetas financed through 
swaps. Portugal and Ireland strengthened the administration of 
their existing exchange controls. 
Pressures eased somewhat 
in October 
and early November. A strong recovery of 
the French franc 
and the Danish krone, reflecting 
reflows which more than offset previous 
outflows, allowed a marked reduction 
in interest rates 
in both countries. 
There were, however, only limited 
reflows in the case of the other currencies under strain. 
Major exchange rate 
tensions re-emerged 
following the decision 
of the Swedish 
authorities on 19th November 
to suspend 
the peg of the 
Swedish krona to the ECU. This led to further 
large increases in 
official interest rates 
in Denmark, while market 
rates rose in 
Ireland and France. On 22ndNovember, agreement was 
reached to devalue the central 
parities of both the 
Spanish peseta and 
the Portuguese escudo 
by 6%. Following this move, 
official interest rates were raised in 
Spain and Portugal to signal 
the commitment 
to the new central parities and the peseta 
and the escudo strengthened again, moving towards the top of 
the wide band. 
At the same time, 
Spain removed 
the measures penalising capital movements, 
and soon thereafter 
all capital 
controls were 
abolished in Portugal. Tensions increased in the narrow 
band on 10th December following 
the decision by Norway 
to abandon the 
unilateral currency peg 
to the ECU but central parities were 
successfully defended 
in the remainder 
of the year. In early January 1993, the 
French franc and the Irish pound came under further 
pressure. The renewed attack 
on the French franc was rather short-lived, with pressures 
easing after the release 
of a new joint statement from the 
French and German authorities, 
supported by 
an increase in the Banque de France repurchase agreement 
rate. Against this 
background, and following a sharp rise 
in official interest rates, the Irish pound also firmed. 
In late January, however, a further cut 
in interest rates 
in the United Kingdom 
and a sharp drop 
in the pound sterling rekindled intense pressure 
on the Irish pound. Official 
interest rates in Ireland were 
raised once more to exceptional 
levels, but with consequences 
for market rates that were 
perceived as unsustainable 
in the light of domestic conditions, 
and a 10% devaluation of the Irish 
pound was agreed 
on 30th January. A few days later, the 
Danish krone came under renewed attack. A combination of 
collective support through intramarginal 
intervention by several Community central banks, a 
rise in Danish interest rates 
and a cut in official 
interest rates in Germany helped to restore 
calm in the market. Capital 
subsequently reflowed into the 
Danish krone. In the first weeks following 
their withdrawal 
from the ERM, both the Italian 
lira and the pound sterling depreciated sharply. 
After falling to record lows against the Deutsche 
Mark at the beginning of 
October, both currencies recovered ground although market 
conditions remained volatile subsequently. 
At the end of 1992, the 
lira had lost 12% and the 
pound 13% against the 
Deutsche Mark compared to 
market exchange rates on 
16th September. In the first 
two months of 1993, both currencies came under further 
downward pressure. 
The turbulence in the 
ERM also affected 
the Greek drachma. In September 1992, 
pressures on the drachma were considerable, leading the 
Bank of Greece to 
raise its 
official lending rate from 
30% to 
40%, to intervene heavily in the foreign exchange market, and 
to tighten capital controls, while the 
speed of depreciation of the Greek currency accelerated. 
As tensions eased, 
the official lending 
rate was reduced and the imposed capital controls were 
lifted. The sharp movements in nominal exchange rates in the latter 
part of 
1992 have substantially modified competitive positions 
within the Community 
(see Table 
4). In those countries which recorded the largest losses 
of intra-ERM competitiveness 
in the 
period before

the crisis, recent depreciations have more 
than fully offset the losses in Italy since 
the last realignment in 1987; have led 
to a significant improvement in the competitive position of the 
United Kingdom relative 
to the entry point of the pound sterling in October 1990; while 
in Spain competitiveness has 
approached the levels prevailing 
when the peseta entered 
the ERM in June 1989. In most other 
ERM countries, the exchange rate appreciation 
by the end 
of the 
year returned competitiveness 
closer to 1987 levels, although France continued 
to show gains, 
and Germany losses, in intra-Community competitiveness relative 
to this date. 
Policy responses 
to the ERM crisis The 1987 Basle-Nyborg 
Agreement calls on the monetary authorities 
to exploit the scope 
for a more active, flexible 
and concerted use 
of three instruments to counter 
tensions in the ERM: interest rate 
changes; exchange rate movement within the band; and 
official intervention 
in foreign exchange markets. However, 
when exchange rates are out of 
line with fundamentals and the implementation 
of corrective domestic policies 
is not possible, 
realignments become necessary.

were used to counter 
recent tensions, although 
the size of the 
changes and the 
speed of response differed 
from country to country and 
from occasion to occasion. In some countries, the 
scope for interest rate increases 
in response to exchange 
rate pressure was limited, because 
higher interest rates 
were seen 
either to aggravate the severity 
of the recession - as in the 
United Kingdom where 
the bulk 
of lending is at short-term rates 
- andlor to add 
to the difficulties 
of achieving fiscal 
consolidation where large stocks of short- 
term government debt existed 
- as in Italy. In Ireland, interest rates were increased sharply 
and repeatedly to levels 
which ultimately became unsustainable. The defence of the existing 
central parities through interest rate increases 
did not in the end prove feasible 
in these three 
cases. In countries facing upward pressure 
on their currencies, domestic price developments, 
in particular 
in Germany, restricted the 
scope for 
adjusting interest 
rate policy. Official 
interest rates in these countries 
were cut slightly in mid-September, and short-term market 
rates rapidly declined by about 
l%, without, however, bringing about a significant reduction 
in foreign exchange tensions. 
During the crisis, 
in some instances exchange rate movement within 
the band resulted in stabilising speculation 
which helped to dampen 
pressures. In other situations, 
however, exchange 
rate tensions were exacerbated 
when currencies hit the lower limit. 
When there was a concern that a movement 
to the lower 
margin could 
be interpreted by market 
participants as weakening the credibility 
of the central parity, interventions were 
made within the margins. 
Intervention - both within and 
at the margins 
- was undertaken in unprecedented 
amounts, reflecting the massive 
capital movements which occurred in an 
environment of almost fully liberalised 
capital transactions and a high degree of financial integration 
within the Community. The effectiveness 
of intervention depended 
on the degree of support 
from other instruments, in particular interest rate 
changes. At times, simultaneous intra-marginal 
intervention by several 
central banks proved helpful. The scale of intervention had important 
monetary consequences, exerting a contractionary impact 
on the money supply where 
currencies were subject 
to downward 
pressure, and an expansionary effect where the opposite 
occurred. The virulence of the tension in the ERM during the autumn 
of 1992 led some 
countries to take temporary measures 
of varying types to 
discourage capital outflows to protect their currencies from 
speculation especially 
when this took the 
form of "short sales". 
In all cases the measures were 
phased out by the end of 
the year. 
When the efforts 
of the authorities 
to stabilise exchange markets proved 
unsuccessful, a realignment became unavoidable. The unprecedented occurrence of four 
realignments in five months 
emphasised the difficulty facing the authorities in restoring 
calm in the markets. This may be related 
to perceptions in 
the market that policy measures 
to counter tensions were being 
taken on a piecemeal basis, 
with insufficient attention devoted to 
the restoration 
of the credibility 
of the parity grid 
as a whole. 3. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND MONETARY POLICY ISSUES When, at the end of 1992, the Committee of Governors conducted the ex-ante co- 
ordination exercise 
to assess the appropriate thrust of monetary policies in 
the Member States 
and to 
examine national monetary 
policy intentions for 1993, forecasts 
of economic developments in the Community 
were surrounded by a large margin of uncertainty. 
In addition, tensions in the exchange markets had not 
yet abated. 3.1 Economic prospects 
According to the latest forecasts 
by international institutions, 
economic activity 
in 1993 within the Community 
is likely to receive only a modest stimulus 
from external demand. An upswing in world trade is expected, though the pace 
of the recovery 
is likely to 
remain quite slow. In the 
United States, there are clear signs that a 
more sustained upturn 
will unfold in 1993, while in 
Japan the recent expansionary fiscal and 
monetary measures should 
help a recovery 
to get underway in the course 
of the year. A moderate upswing may also take 
place in EFTA countries, 
although this 
is closely dependent on developments within the 
Community in the light 
of the strong trade links 
between the two blocs. Against this 
background of slow growth in activity, 
world trade prices are likely 
to remain relatively soft 
in national currency terms. 
The modest boost from 
world demand 
is expected to be counterbalanced 
by weak domestic spending 
given the low 
level of business and consumer confidence 
in the Community at the 
end of 1992. 
As a result, economic growth 
within the Community in 1993 
may dip below 1%. 
The overall fiscal deficit is likely to remain large in 1993. Reductions 
in budget deficits are expected in some 
Community countries which had relatively high levels of public 
debt or deficits in 1992 - in particular, in Belgium, Greece, Spain, 
Italy and Portugal 
- although the prolongation 
of the cyclical downswing may make progress towards fiscal 
consolidation more difficult. In contrast, 
both the operation 
of automatic stabilisers and the 
implementation of some discretionary measures 
may lead to 
higher budget deficits 
in other countries, most notably 
in the United Kingdom 
and France. In Germany, the fiscal deficit 
is likely to increase relative 
to GDP, although 
some consolidation measures were announced in 
January 1993. 
In the ex-ante exercise, some easing 
of cost pressures 
during 1993 was judged 
likely in the Community 
as a whole. As output is expected to remain below potential and 
labour market conditions 
to remain 
slack, wage moderation should reduce labour cost 
pressure. External price influences 
may also 
be relatively favourable 
on average, although the 
rebound in the dollar 
in late 1992 will limit the benefit if 
it is sustained. Moreover, a rise in 
import prices 
will occur in the countries 
where currencies have depreciated and increases in 
indirect taxation 
or in public sector 
administered prices may 
add to 
inflationary pressure in 
some countries, for instance in Germany, 
where indirect taxes were increased in early 1993. 
3.2 Monetary policy issues Monetary policy orientations for 
1993 When the ex-ante 
co-ordination exercise was conducted by the Committee 
of Governors in December 1992, the 
assessment of national monetary policy intentions 
for 1993 was made more 
difficult by major uncertainties 
in the economic outlook 
and by remaining instability in the ERM. 
However, precisely 
when uncertainties prevail 
it is of the utmost 
importance that monetary policy provides 
an anchor of nominal stability, which constitutes a 
prerequisite for a sustainable recovery 
of economic activity. For this reason, the Committee 
emphasised the need for maintaining a 
medium-term oriented monetary policy which ensures 
a further decline in inflation 
in the Community. Among the 
ERM countries setting monetary targets, the continuity of the 
anti- inflationary monetary stance 
in Germany is reflected in a target for M3 growth in 1993 of 
4.5% to 6.5% (see Table 3 
on page 18). The 
small increase compared to last 
year's target of 3.5% to 5.5% takes account 
of various factors: a somewhat higher estimated potential 
economic growth in 
eastern Germany; 
a larger decline envisaged 
in the trend in the velocity 
of circulation of money; and price rises due 
to administrative measures, primarily 
in eastern Germany. In France, monetary 
policy in 1993 will continue to focus on maintaining the 
current central parity 
of the franc 
within the ERM and on the control 
of inflation. For these 
reasons, the target 
for M3 growth was set at 
4% to 
6.5% for 1993, similar 
to the 4% 
to 6% objective in 1992. The upper limit 
of the range 
was increased slightly to take account of the 
outlook for a non-inflationary upturn 
in the French economy. In Spain, the target range for 
"ALP" growth in 1993 (liquid 
assets held 
by the public) has been 
fixed at 4.5% 
to 7.5%. The decrease from the range 
of 8% to 11% set 
in 1992, partly reflects the moderate prospects 
for economic growth 
and the need 
to achieve a further reduction 
in inflation, as well as a rate of growth of the velocity 
of circulation of ALP which 
is expected to be closer to 
its historic trend. In the other 
ERM countries, monetary policy is predominantly aimed at achieving 
price stability 
by targeting the 
exchange rate vis-A-vis the Deutsche Mark. 
In Denmark, the 
central bank 
has a supplementary target for the 
growth of the domestic source 
of the money 
supply. However, 
in present circumstances of stagnating economic activity 
and unprecedented currency unrest, adherence 
to the supplementary target 
has been of minor importance. With effect from 1993, a 
monetary target is no longer set 
in the Netherlands, 
and in Portugal the authorities have 
discontinued posting 
targets for "L-" (total liquidity held by 
non-financial residents) 
and M3. 
Traditionally, quantitative monetary targets have not 
been set in Belgium, Luxembourg 
and Ireland. In the countries 
which have temporarily 
suspended the participation 
of their currencies in the ERM, the target range 
of the growth of M2 
in Italy was set at 5% 
to 7% for 
1993, as was the 
case in 1992. Monetary policy is aimed at 
providing economic agents 
with a stable framework 
and at 
preventing the recent 
depreciation of the lira from 
contributing to inflation. In 
the United Kingdom, the authorities have adopted a new monetary policy 
framework since the suspension of sterling's membership 
of the ERM, with 
an explicit inflation objective of 
1% to 4% for underlying inflation, falling 
to 2% or less in the 
medium- term. A wide range 
of indicators will be used 
to assess potential inflationary pressure, 
including narrow and broad monetary aggregates, asset prices 
and the exchange 
rate. Finally, in Greece, the monetary policy stance 
will remain restrictive. 
The non- accommodating exchange 
rate policy will continue. Moreover, real interest 
rates will remain high in 1993, with nominal interest rates not being reduced at a faster pace than the 
deceleration of inflation. 
An M3 growth 
target of 9-12% has been set to 
guide policy. Challenges facing monetary policy 
Given the numerous uncertainties remaining 
in the international and domestic 
economic environment, the 
national authorities of Member States 
face considerable challenges in the conduct 
of their monetary policies. 
In particular, exchange 
rate stability has to be restored in a situation in 
which there is the risk of a prolongation of the economic 
slowdown throughout the Community. In addition, 
in countries where currencies 
have recently been devalued 
or where participation in the ERM has been suspended, monetary 
policy must remain vigilant 
to avoid 
the dangers 
of a pick-up in inflationary pressures which 
would not only erode the 
hard-won anti-inflationary gains of past years but also risk 
unsettling the more 
balanced pattern 
of international competitiveness among Member States 
resulting from recent exchange 
rate adjustments. As already stressed in 
last year's Annual 
Report, the achievement 
of macro- economic policy objectives hinges critically not 
only on an 
appropriate national monetary 
policy but also on adequate support from 
fiscal policy and wage developments. For these 
reasons, the process of fiscal 
consolidation must continue 
in those countries with excessive 
budget deficits 
andfor public debt levels. In other countries, weaker economic activity should 
not lead to increases 
in the deficit 
beyond those accounted 
for by automatic fiscal stabilisers. 
In addition, while in some Community countries nominal 
wage growth has moderated in 1992, a substantial further reduction 
is still necessary 
where labour costs 
rise at a 
rapid pace. Given the crucial 
role played by labour markets in the economy, 
all Community countries 
should implement without 
delay the necessary structural measures 
to improve market flexibility. Finally, in those countries where the presence 
of non-competitive practices 
in certain markets 
for goods and services hampers the achievement of faster disinflation, the 
appropriate supply-side policies should 
be promptly introduced. 
To conclude, it 
is of the utmost importance 
to improve the balance between fiscal 
and monetary policies and 
to strengthen 
supply-side policies 
in Community countries. As the 
disappointing economic 
and financial 
developments in 1992 have highlighted, decisive 
progress in these fields is required not 
only to 
lay the foundations 
for sustained economic 
growth, but also to restore credibility 
in the ERM and to 
achieve the degree of convergence 
and market flexibility 
which are necessary for the 
successful completion of the EMU process. 4. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRIVATE ECU MARKET The private ECU has remained 
essentially a financial instrument. Its use in the 
banking sector 
and in securities markets 
continued to 
grow in 1992, albeit at 
a slower pace 
than in previous years (see Table 
5). At the same 
time, the private 
ECU was very actively traded in foreign exchange 
and futures markets. However, these developments were not 
accompanied by any significant 
expansion in its use for non-financial transactions 
which remained very limited. 
The period under review 
was characterised by two distinct phases. 
In the first half 
of 1992, the private 
ECU market continued to 
grow steadily after the agreement of the 
Maastricht Treaty in 
December 1991. After mid-year, however, there was 
a marked slowdown in the wake of the difficulties 
faced in the ratification of the Treaty 
and the subsequent tensions in the ERM. Greater interest 
and exchange rate volatility in the 
Community increased significantly 
the risks attached to 
ECU-denominated investments. 
Market participants either shifted into traditionally strong currencies 
or tried to hedge their 
ECU exposure, as reflected in the 
sharp increase in the turnover in the 
ECU futures market 
in London and Paris. This pattern of market developments 
was reflected in both the banking and the 
bond sectors of the market. 
In contrast to 
1991, the 
overall level 
of lending in private ECUs 
expanded only moderately. While interbank 
claims increased somewhat, bank lending to 
non- banks remained broadly 
unchanged over the 
first nine months 
of 1992. Banks' liabilities in 
ECUs vis-g-vis banks and non-banks 
increased significantly 
until end-June but contracted 
slightly in the third quarter 
of the last year. 
The decline 
in ECU liabilities of the banking 
sector is mainly attributable 
to the reduction 
of deposits 
held by central banks. 
This was partly the result of exchange market intervention 
in private ECUs 
- central banks' reserves 
in private ECUs fell from 
ECU 30.6 billion at end-June 
1992 to ECU 21 billion at end- 
September 1992 
- but also reflected the 
impact of diminishing bond issuing activity 
of public authorities and the concurrent decline 
in the flow 
of new deposits by central banks. 
The turnaround in market developments after mid-1992 was particularly 
pronounced in the securities 
segment of the ECU financial markets. As demand for ECU securities dried up 
in the second half of 1992, a premium emerged in the market long-term 
ECU bond yield relative 
to the theoretical ECU 
yield. This development 
made new ECU issues relatively expensive 
and thus reduced the attractiveness of borrowing programmes, 
which accordingly were curtailed. 
As a consequence, the private 
ECU fell from the third 
to the sixth place 
in the rank 
of currencies which are used for international bond issuance. 
The cutback in ECU bond issues 
was substantial. However, owing to low levels 
of redemption, the amount of outstanding 
ECU-denominated bonds increased slightly over the period under 
review. In contrast, the 
stock of short-term instruments denominated in private ECU 
decreased as 
a result of a contraction in the Euro-note 
and Euro-commercial paper sector.

of pnvate ECUs Despite these difficult conditions, the 
ECU market showed resilience. In 
particular, it demonstrated its ability to adapt to the sharp fluctuations of its component 
currencies, as witnessed by the relatively rapid 
return to 
a small spread between the market 
value and the theoretical 
value of both the ECU exchange rate and interest rates. 
In early 1993, there was a resumption 
of issuance in the ECU bond 
market. The foreign exchange market survey, carried 
out in April 1992 in the major 
financial centres, showed 
an increase in the use 
of the private ECU. 
As compared to April 1989, 
when the previous 
survey took 
place, the private ECU 
was involved in 
one side of 3% of all transactions against 0.9% three 
years earlier. Within the Community, transactions 
involving the private 
ECU accounted 
for between 5% and 10% of total turnover in most 
Member States.

COMMUNITY COUNTRIES 
There is 
unanimous agreement 
among Community central banks that monetary 
policies should pursue the final 
goal of achieving and maintaining price stability. 
There are, nevertheless, differences 
in the way national monetary policies are implemented. In some 
countries, an intermediate objective 
is set for money 
supply growth or its domestic source, 
while in other countries monetary 
policy is predominantly determined through 
the pursuit of 
an exchange rate target. In the United Kingdom, the authorities have adopted 
an explicit inflation objective since 
the suspension of sterling's membership of the 
ERM. In spite of these 
differences, however, money market interest rates are 
an important, or even the key, operational target 
in the 
daily conduct 
of monetary policy in 
all Community countries. 
Moreover, increasing resort 
to market oriented techniques has in recent years promoted 
convergence in the monetary instruments 
and procedures which Community central banks use 
to influence short-term market rates (see 
Annex I for a description of major changes since the 
start of 
Stage One). 
Table 6 presents a 
summary of the principal monetary instruments and procedures 
in Community countries. It 
shows that, at present, open market operations are the main 
monetary instrument 
in most Member States. However, differences across countries persist, in 
particular regarding the use 
of reserve requirements, the significance 
of standing facilities 
offered by the central banks 
(such as the discount 
window, other forms 
of direct lending, 
and deposit facilities) 
and the frequency 
of central bank 
operations in the market. Also, Community central banks may use different strategies 
to signal 
their policy intentions. 
1. PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS Central banks influence 
money market interest rates 
by setting the terms 
on which they accommodate the 
demand of commercial banks for 
central bank reserves, 
which are needed either to fulfil clearing obligations 
or to 
meet statutory reserve requirements. 
There may be situations, however, 
in which 
central bank reserves are in excess of banks' demand. 
In such cases, central banks influence 
short-term market rates by setting the terms 
on which they 
offer deposit facilities, issue short-term 
debt or sell assets. In many countries, 
reserve requirements 
help to induce or enlarge the demand 
for central bank reserves. Moreover, 
when reserve requirements have to 
be fulfilled 
only on average over a period, as 
is normally the 
case in Community countries, this allows the 
banking system 
to cope with temporary liquidity shortages 
or surpluses in the market without 
central bank intervention 
and thus may reduce the variability 
of very short-term interest rates. 
Reserve requirements, however, impose 
an implicit tax on bank intermediation when they are 
not remunerated 
at market rates 
and thus may encourage financial disintermediation 
or TABLE 6: MONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURES - Not applicable or not

BELGIUM NO (below market) ¤ El W ¤ delocalisation. To prevent this, some 
Member States prefer either to remunerate at market 
rates, or not to impose reserve requirements for monetary policy purposes, 
and to 
use other arrangements to induce a liquidity shortage in the market, 
when necessary. Standing facilities 
are offered by 
central banks at pre-announced 
rates and may be 
used at the initiative 
of individual commercial banks. These facilities continue in many cases 
to play 
an important role in regulating money market conditions and signalling 
the intentions of the monetary authorities. Lending facilities at below market interest 
rates provide 
a significant proportion of the 
supply of central bank money only in 
the Netherlands - through ordinary advances 
on current account 
- and in Germany - through the rediscounting 
of trade bills. In a majority 
of Community countries, 
such facilities do not exist 
or are not extensively 
used. Deposit facilities are offered in a 
few countries to mop up liquidity surpluses and 
sometimes set a lower limit 
to very 
short-term market rates. Finally, most central banks offer 
an overdraft facility 
to finance end-of-day clearing imbalances. 
The facility is typically granted at a penalty 
rate and often 
provides an upper limit 
to very 
short-term market rates. 
Over the last decade, a 
common feature of monetary policy management 
in the Community has been the increasing recourse to 
open market operations 
instead of standing 
facilities. Today, most Community 
central banks favour 
open market operations, 
as these are conducted at their own discretion 
and make use 
of market mechanisms 
in distributing liquidity and giving policy signals. 
Outright open 
market transactions 
are carried out in most Community countries 
but are a major policy instrument 
only in the United Kingdom, Denmark 
and Portugal. Over 
half of 
the Bank of England's operations 
in the money market are outright purchases of 
bills with various maturities. Since 
April 1992, the Danmarks Nationalbank 
has issued certificates 
of deposit on a regular basis, 
with the interest rate 
on the certificates steering market rates. 
The certificates may 
be repurchased by the central bank 
when there is a need 
to supply liquidity. In Portugal, liquidity surpluses 
in the market are usually drained 
by the 
issue of 
central bank securities. Since the 
substantial reduction in reserve requirements 
in the 
spring of 
1993, the Deutsche Bundesbank has 
issued liquidity paper in the 
form of Treasury discount 
paper. This paper may be sold to 
non-banks as well as banks. Reversed transactions 
in domestic securities 
have become the main instrument 
for regulating money market conditions in most Member States. Purchase and resale transactions 
("repos"), which comprise the purchase of securities under a contract 
providing for 
their resale at a specified price 
on a given future date, are used to supply reserves, 
while the mirror 
image, sale 
and repurchase agreements ("reverse repos") are used to absorb liquidity. 
The attractiveness of 
such operations stems from the fact that 
they can 
be implemented quickly 
and have no 
significant effect 
on the prices 
of the assets used 
in the operations. Also, the 
central bank retains the initiative 
in setting the amount, timing and duration 
of the contract, 
and in deciding whether to renew it 
or to let it unwind 
upon maturity. Foreign exchange 
swap transactions (a combination of a spot and forward 
transaction) may be used as an instrument of domestic money market policy, without a direct 
impact on exchange rates. They 
can be 
very flexible in terms of maturity and volume. In 
Ireland, where they 
can be settled on the same day, these transactions 
are a major monetary 
instrument. The instrument is used 
at times in other Community countries, in particular 
when the central bank wishes to sterilise the 
impact of large foreign reserve flows on domestic 
liquidity conditions. 
2. PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES Monetary policy procedures 
vary across Community countries, in particular 
according to the frequency 
of central bank 
operations, the setting 
of the volumes of the 
transactions and of the interest rates, 
and the selection of counterparties to the operations. 
The frequency of open 
market operations 
is often linked to their maturity. 
It may also reflect 
the financial environment, 
in particular the importance 
of reserve requirements. In 
the United Kingdom, 
for instance, in the 
absence of reserve requirements, 
the central bank 
may intervene in the money market 
several times a day. 
By contrast, in Germany, where 
reserve requirements 
play an important role 
in stabilising the demand 
for central bank 
reserves, the central bank typically intervenes 
only once 
a week. In France, the frequency of 
central bank intervention 
in the market has 
recently tended to 
increase, partly 
as a result 
of cuts in reserve requirements. The 
frequency of operations may 
also in some cases reflect the 
degree of control 
which the central bank wishes to exercise over short-term market interest 
rates. In the case 
of standing facilities, interest rates are pre-announced by central banks 
and volumes are determined 
by banks' demand, although 
generally subject to some limits. In 
the case of 
open market operations, 
various auction 
procedures enable central banks to set 
interest rates 
and/or volumes more flexibly. "Volume tenders", 
with banks bidding only for 
volumes supplied by the 
central bank at 
a pre-set interest rate, help 
to make monetary policy 
intentions explicit and 
to stabilise market expectations. "Interest 
rate tender" techniques, 
in which banks submit bids covering 
both the volume 
and the rate, give a greater weight 
to market forces in interest rate determination. 
Most Community central banks tend 
to use one 
approach, although some 
may exploit 
the advantages 
of the different types of auction 
depending on the circumstances. 
Experience varies across 
Community countries regarding the extent 
to which 
central bank operations are 
conducted with 
all money market participants 
or only with a few 
intermediaries. In the 
United Kingdom 
and Belgium, the desire for operational efficiency 
has led the central bank to conduct 
most market 
operations with a few specialised 
counterparties. Most other Community 
central banks in principle operate 
with all market participants. Large 
banks or market makers, however, 
may be selected in some countries 
when the central bank 
wishes to 
bring about a rapid change 
in market interest 
rates through fine-tuning operations. 
3. SIGNALLING MONETARY POLICY INTENTIONS 
Central banks convey policy signals 
to the market mainly through their "key" 
interest rates (see Chart 
6 on page 21). These are often the rates applied to standing facilities 
but may also 
be those at 
which central 
banks provide 
or withdraw liquidity through 
open market operations. Some Community 
central banks rely primarily 
on a single key 
rate both to steer market rates and to give policy 
signals, as is the case in Ireland. Others employ several 
rates which may give 
more flexibility both in the conduct 
of operations and in the provision 
of policy signals. 
In some cases, one rate provides 
an upper limit 
or a lower 
limit to market 
rates, while a second 
rate serves to guide them. In 
other cases, two 
rates may set a corridor 
for short-term market rates, the latter being steered 
through money market interventions by the 
central bank, 
as is the case in Belgium. Central banks 
can also indicate policy intentions 
by changing procedures, in 
particular the auction procedure 
or the maturity of market operations. For instance, some 
central banks 
may switch 
from interest rate 
to volume tenders 
to stabilise market expectations, or to reinforce the impact 
of adjustments in official interest rates, 
as did the 
Deutsche Bundesbank in September 1992. 
111. INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES OF COMMUNITY CENTRAL BANKS 1. STATUTES AND INDEPENDENCE The Treaty on European Union lays down a clear mandate 
for the European 
System of Central Banks (ESCB) 
to maintain 
price stability. 
To fulfil this mandate, 
it is important that the decision-making authorities 
of the ESCB are not subject 
to directives from other bodies which could stand in conflict 
with this 
objective. In consequence, the ESCB Statute lays 
down a number 
of provisions to ensure that the System 
will be independent in the performance 
of its assigned tasks. 
In particular, the 
Statute specifies that the ECB, the 
national central 
banks and any member of their 
decision- making bodies shall 
act without receiving instructions from national 
or Community authorities. Moreover, the Statute guarantees that members 
of the decision-making bodies are 
provided with assured tenure 
to fulfil their duties. In 
addition to 
the provisions specifying 
the political or institutional independence, the economic 
or practical independence 
of the 
System is confirmed by the functional, operational 
and financial 
provisions embodied in the Statute. 
In accordance with Article 108 of the Treaty, 
each Member State shall ensure, at 
the latest at the date 
of the establishment 
of the ESCB, that 
its national legislation including 
the statute of 
its national central bank is compatible with the Treaty and the 
Statute of the 
ESCB.1 Article 109e(5) stipulates that the process leading 
to the independence of central 
banks should start during the Second Stage. The prohibition 
on central banks extending 
overdrafts or any other type 
of credit to the public sector provided for 
in Article 104 of the 
Treaty will apply as from the start 
of Stage Two (see Article 
109e(3) of the 
 treat^).^ A number 
of countries have 
decided to begin 
the process leading towards full 
central bank independence. 
Against this 
background, the following section presents a brief 
summary of the current institutional features 
of national central banks in the Community (see 
Table 7). This description concentrates 
on the main aspects whereas 
Annex I1 offers a 
more extensive summary 
of national features. 
l This provision does not 
apply to the 
United Kingdom as long as it 
does not participate in the third stage 
of EMU (see Sections 
5 and 11 of the Protocol on 
certain provisions relating 
to the 
United Kingdom). 
Furthermore, the Decision taken 
by the Heads 
of State 
and Government 
at their Edinburgh Summit 
meeting on 1 lthll2th December 1992 implies that 
Denmark (which 
has given notification that 
it will 
not participate 
in Stage Three of 
EMU) will retain 
its existing powers in the field 
of monetary policy 
according to its national laws and regulations, including 
the powers 
of Danmarks Nationalbank in the 
field of 
monetary policy. Subject to Section 11 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United 
Kingdom which grants the 
government the right 
to maintain its "ways and means"

Not all Community central banks have a 
clear statutory objective in the monetary 
policy field. Nevertheless, there 
is a common agreement 
among them that the principal goal 
of policy 
is to safeguard the 
value of the currency, 
or in other words to pursue price stability. 
Even in 
the cases where this 
is not a 
statutory obligation, this 
is taken to 
be a fundamental 
monetary policy responsibility. 
The principal tasks 
of Community central 
banks are relatively similar. 
All central banks have responsibility for executing 
monetary policy 
and foreign exchange operations. 
In addition, Community central banks 
typically issue bank notes, 
act as the bank 
for commercial banks, provide services 
to the government as a 
fiscal agent, manage official reserves, 
and have responsibilities with respect to payment systems. Central 
banks also generally have 
an explicit mandate 
to safeguard financial stability. Most central 
banks have legal responsibilities for banking supervision, 
but Belgium, Denmark, and 
Germany are exceptions. 
3. THE CONDUCT OF MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY In spite of the broad similarity 
in the principal tasks, there are substantial 
differences in the extent 
of central bank 
responsibility for the formulation 
and implementation of monetary policy. 
Monetary policy 
formulation and implementation The degree of practical independence 
of the central bank in the formulation of 
monetary policy, 
for example such as the setting 
of quantified intermediate objectives, varies 
considerably. It depends not 
only on legal provisions but 
also on historical traditions and 
practices which have evolved over 
an extended period. National experiences vary across a 
spectrum: ranging 
from those where there is complete discretion for the central bank, 
as in Germany; to intermediate cases 
where there is considerable autonomy 
in practice, but where 
the government 
may have some rights, either legally 
or through custom, to influence 
or to initiate decisions; through to cases 
where the government 
has primary responsibility 
for policy formulation 
and where the 
central bank 
plays an advisory role. 
A key component of central bank 
independence is the degree 
of freedom to change official interest rates. 
From a legal viewpoint, most Community central banks have 
the power to alter key rates. However, 
in some countries there 
is an important distinction 
between legal rights and customary practice 
to the effect that governments 
are closely involved with key decisions. In the United Kingdom, for example, the government has 
traditionally been responsible for 
policy formulation, though acting in consultation 
with the central bank. 
In France, monetary 
policy decisions 
are taken jointly with the government. Central banks generally have considerable autonomy 
in selecting the mix of 
monetary policy instruments 
and in 
the techniques used in money market operations. 
In Germany, for example, the 
set of available instruments 
is enshrined in the central bank 
statute; within this legal framework there 
is complete freedom to 
use the instruments flexibly. 
A broad caveat applies 
to the use 
of reserve requirements 
in Community countries. As reserve 
requirements have fiscal implications if 
they are not remunerated at 
market rates, there 
is often government involvement, 
for example in determining the maximum 
rate which can 
be applied, and in 
specifying the financial instruments subject 
to the obligation. 
Exchange rate regime 
Most Community countries participate 
in the Exchange Rate Mechanism 
and in several countries 
- Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands 
and Portugal - the exchange rate is the only intermediate target for monetary policy. 
The power to decide whether 
or not to participate in exchange 
rate arrangements, such as the EMS, resides with the government in 
all Community countries. 
This also applies 
to decisions on changes in central parities. However, central banks are often assigned 
considerable operational freedom 
in the day-to-day operation of exchange 
rate policy. For 
example, most central banks have the 
discretion to undertake foreign exchange intervention 
on their own authority; exceptions are France, 
where the Banque 
de France monitors the fluctuation of 
its currency, according to the general directions of the Ministry of Finance; 
and the United Kingdom, where the 
Bank of England acts as 
an agent of the Treasury. 
Role of political authorities 
In several countries there are currently legal provisions which 
may limit 
the independence of central bank decision-making, but in practice these powers 
have never been 
invoked. For example, in the Netherlands, the 
Minister of Finance has the authority to give 
directions to the central bank, although there are strict safeguards controlling this privilege, 
including an appeals procedure 
and a provision enabling the central 
bank to publish 
its opinion. In Belgium, the statutory power of the government commissioner 
and the Minister of 
Finance to suspend 
or to veto 
central bank 
decisions was abolished, as far 
as the basic tasks of 
the Bank are concerned, in 
March 1993. In Germany, decisions 
on policy changes 
may be 
delayed by two weeks at the 
request of the Federal Government, although, thereafter, the 
decision of the Bundesbank rests supreme. 
In other 
central banks, too, there are official censors 
or commissioners appointed 
by governments, whose broad function 
is to monitor the observance of legal obligations. 
Formal powers differ, however: in France, for example, the censor sits 
on the General Council and can 
raise objections to decisions, in 
which case the matter 
is reconsidered; whilst 
in Greece, the non-voting government commissioner 
can veto decisions only 
if he judges them to 
be contrary to national law. 
Government representatives 
sit on the General Council of the central bank in 
Spain, and 
have equal voting rights 
to other members. 
4. APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES 
FOR CENTRAL BANK 
GOVERNORS The political authorities 
play an important role in the appointment of members of 
the principal governing bodies 
of Community central 
banks. A full description 
of national procedures is presented in 
Annex 11. For simplicity, this section concentrates on the 
appointment of central bank Governors, 
who will be members of the Council of the 
EM1 and of the Governing 
or General Council of the ECB. Central bank Governors are normally appointed either 
by the Head 
of State 
on a 
recommendation from the government 
or by the government itself. 
The principal exceptions 
are Italy, where the appointment 
is made by the Board of Directors, although 
with government approval, 
and the Netherlands, 
where nominations for Governor are 
made by 
the central bank, although formal appointment 
is by the Crown. In Germany, 
the Central Bank 
Council is officially consulted 
on nominations. Terms of office differ 
considerably. At one extreme, there 
is no fixed term 
in Denmark and France and, in principle 
at least, appointments 
can be revoked at any time. 
At the other end of the spectrum, the 
term of the Governor is unlimited in Italy. In 
the remaining central banks, 
the term of office normally ranges 
from four years 
in Greece and Spain to eight 
years in Germany (terms in 
Germany can be shorter 
than this, but 
no less than two years). 
Appointments in these countries are 
renewable. Current 
practices can be compared to the provisions in the ESCB Statute 
which specify that 
the term 
of office of national central bank 
Governors shall be at least five 
years (although 
terms can be renewed). Members of the 
Executive Board of the ECB 
will be appointed for eight-year, non-renewable terms. 
5. PROSPECTIVE CHANGES IN CENTRAL BANK 
LEGISLATION As noted above, changes 
must be made 
to central bank legislation. Before the 
start of 
Stage Two 
national legislation 
must conform with 
the Treaty provisions prohibiting 
"monetary financing" 
of budget deficits. 
Before the start 
of Stage Three all central banks must be made independent.3 In Belgium, new legislation 
to this effect was adopted in 
March 1993. In a number of countries, national 
central bank statutes are currently being carefully re-examined 
and proposals 
for changes are under 
discussion. In some cases, deliberations 
are at an advanced stage: 
in Spain, draft legislation 
has been submitted to Parliament, which should 
enter into force 
on 1st January 1994. 
In Greece, draft legislation has 
been prepared and 
it is expected to 
be submitted by the government 
to the Parliament for approval 
during 1993. See preceding footnotes 1 and 2. -48 - IV. ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE 
OF GOVERNORS AND PREPARATION FOR THE MOVE 
TO EMU 1. ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE OF GOVERNORS 
Last year, the 
Annual Report provided a detailed description of 
the functions and 
tasks of the Committee of Governors, 
and its organisational structure. 
The regular activities 
described in this section cover a wide range 
of topics: the co-ordination of monetary policies; 
overseeing the operation 
of the EMS; the monitoring of the private 
ECU market; 
banking supervisory issues; 
and relationships with non-Community 
countries. An additional task 
in 1992 resulted from the mandate of the 
Council of the 
European Communities 
to prepare the move 
to the second and third stages 
of EMU. 
The preliminary work in this field, 
which is described in Part 
2 of this chapter, required 
an adaptation of 
the organisational structure 
of the Committee. 
In performing its tasks, the Committee maintained close contacts with other 
Community bodies 
and established links 
with the 
banking community in 
some areas of 
activity. 1.1 Co-ordination of monetary policies 
The mandate of the Committee 
of Governors calls 
on the Committee to promote 
the co-ordination of monetary policies 
"with the aim 
of achieving price stability 
as a necessary condition for the proper functioning 
of the European Monetary System and the 
realisation of the objective 
of monetary stability". 
This task is carried out within a common 
framework for the monitoring 
of monetary policies 
which was introduced at the beginning 
of Stage One 
of EMU in mid-1990. 
Within this framework, the Committee regularly examined monetary and 
economic trends in the Community 
at its monthly meetings. 
A more detailed forward-looking 
analysis ("ex 
ante exercise") took place in the autumn, before the national authorities took 
final decisions 
on the intermediate objectives 
of monetary policies. 
The Committee assessed, 
in particular, whether the intended guidelines 
for national monetary policies, 
as reflected in 
the setting of intermediate targets, 
were consistent with the objective of downward 
convergence of inflation rates throughout the Community. 
The forward-looking assessment 
carried out 
in December 1991 was supplemented by an "ex 
post" surveillance exercise 
undertaken in the spring 
which compared economic 
and monetary developments with earlier 
projections. The causes of deviations were 
examined and 
the need 
for any adjustment 
of policies was reviewed. 
The "ex ante" and "ex 
post" exercises make use 
of a set 
of commonly agreed and 
mutually consistent indicators. Community-wide economic aggregates play 
an important role. 
To ensure the broad consistency 
of the national projections underpinning the forward-looking 
appraisal, common assumptions 
on economic and financial prospects outside the Community 
were agreed 
by national central banks. 
The analytical foundations of 
the monitoring framework are frequently reviewed 
and improved. This ensures that the adopted approach 
remains appropriate given the rapid 
changes in the economic 
and financial environment. In 
this context, attention 
has recently been paid, for example, to developments 
in cross-border monetary holdings, as these assets are not included in traditional monetary aggregates (see 
Box 3). In addition, the Committee of Governors 
studied in detail, developments 
in public finance in Community countries 
and their implications for the conduct 
of monetary policies. 
This report, which 
is produced annually, 
was transmitted to the Ministers of Finance. 
1.2 Overseeing EMS developments One of the principal activities 
of the Committee 
of Governors is to oversee the operation of the 
EMS. This 
activity includes the regular monthly monitoring of current 
exchange market 
and interest rate developments 
and the analysis 
of all factors, including 
policy measures, which affect the functioning 
of the EMS exchange 
rate mechanism. Following the move 
to Stage One 
of EMU in mid-1990, the monthly monitoring 
exercise has been supplemented by 
an annual examination of the functioning of 
the EMS. The 
review for 1992 focused 
on the recent turmoil in the foreign exchange markets (see 
Chapter I). In addition, the Committee 
is currently assessing which 
lessons might be drawn from the 
recent events, 
in accordance with the invitation from the European Council given at 
its special meeting of 16th October 
1992 in Birmingham. 1.3. Monitoring the private 
ECU market Since 1984, developments 
in the private 
ECU market have been examined 
on an 
annual basis. 
The surveys assess the monetary implications of the use 
of the private ECU by 
national and Community authorities as 
well as by the private sector, 
and review the legal 
and administrative framework supporting this use. In addition, the Committee 
has studied the 
functioning of the ECU clearing 
system and is currently monitoring the implementation 
of reforms which the ECU Banking 
Association agreed to undertake in February 1992. These 
reforms should bring the system 
to a level of soundness consistent 
with the requirements set 
out in the report of the 
G- 10 Committee on Interbank Netting Schemes in 1990 
(the so-called "Lamfalussy Report"). 
1.4. Issues in 
the field of banking supervision 
In the past year, the Committee 
has concentrated on three issues in 
the banking supervisory area. 
Firstly, considerable 
attention was devoted to 
the implications 
of the Second 
Banking Co-ordination Directive establishing the Single Market 
in the banking sector, 
which came into 
force on 1st January 1993. 
Under this Directive, credit institutions authorised 
in Box 3: CROSS-BORDER HOLDINGS AND MONETARY ANALYSIS 
Cross-border l~old~ngs (CBHs) may be defined as deposits of 
the non-bank sector held with 
banks located in countries other 
than those 
111 which the holders are resident. Several reasons may underlie the 
decision to keep nioney abroad These include the avoidance of actual or expected domestic regulations, such 
as reserve requirements or capital income taxation; the reduct1011 of transaction costs; and the 
divers~fication of country risk on monetary assets. 
Economic and fin'mcial lntegratloli has led to a steady Increase III CBHs held by Community residents, as shown by the graph. However, there are 
significant national differences 
both in the size 
of CBHs and in their pattern of growth. These differences are 
linked to particular features of national financial systems, 
such as the import'mce of financ~al vehicles, atld the impact 
of domestic regulations. In relation to national GDP, residents 
in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands 
and the UK hold proportions of CBHs above the 
Community average. 
The graph also shows 
the percentage of 
CBHs which 
Community residents 
hold with banks located within the 
EEC and the proportion of the total which 
is denom~nated in Community currencies 
(excluding Danish krone, Greek 
dracluna, Spanish peseta 
and Portuguese escudo for which 
data are not 
available). The high 
value of both these proportions 
throughout the sample stems 
from the 
particularly close 
integration among 
Commun~ty countries 111 the financial 
and monetary sphere. Despite their rapid 
expansion in recent years, CBHs still represent 
a relatively small proportion 
of Community residents' monetary assets. Traditional 
monetary aggregates have consequently maintained their 
usefulness in monetary analys~s. However, as financial integration progresses further, CBHs may become 
increasingly important 
in the future.

establish branches and 
to provide services 
throughout the Community without the 
need for further authorisation in the host State. 
In accordance with the fundamental principle 
of home country supervision, the responsibility 
for supervision rests 
with the authorities 
in the Member 
State where the credit institution 
has been authorised. 
The effective implementation of this principle requires the strengthening of 
the existing co-operation 
between the supervisory authorities of the "home country", 
on the one hand, and of the country hosting 
foreign branches, on the other. 
To this end, bilateral 
agreements are being concluded 
to determine the 
practical guidelines covering the supervision 
of branches of credit institutions 
established in other Member States. Secondly, the Committee 
of Governors defined a series of principles which could 
be applied to monitor and supervise conglomerates containing 
a bank. The Committee also 
considered the potential 
for regulatory arbitrage arising from the organisation of activities 
within a conglomerate and the extent 
to which the lack of transparency of 
the group's structure could increase the difficulties 
of assessing risks on a group-wide basis. 
The Committee agreed to encourage 
discussions between 
bank supervisors and other supervisory 
authorities in order 
to study the possibilities 
of collaboration and of a convergence in the respective approaches. 
The results of the Committee's deliberations were passed to the 
EC Banking Advisory Committee 
and the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision 
to assist them in carrying these discussions forward. 
Thirdly, in common 
with a number of other groups, the Committee of Governors 
has also been considering the 
lessons to 
be learned 
from the case of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). Particular 
attention is being paid 
to the Bingham Inquiry 
Report and 
to the implications 
of the Basle Committee's 
paper "Minimum standards 
for the 
supervision of international banking groups 
and their cross-border establishments" 
for EC legislation. In addition, the Committee 
of Governors is studying the following 
issues: the merits and limitations of the 
central credit registers 
which currently exist in several Member 
States and how the information 
they contain 
might be 
shared among the respective banking 
supervisory authorities; and the evidence 
for financial fragility 
and the problems 
which this causes for supervisors. 1.5. Co-operation with other Community bodies 
The Committee of Governors has maintained close contacts with 
several Community bodies. 
Firstly, on several occasions 
the European Parliament was informed of the work 
of the Committee of Governors. In 
April 1992, the 
Chairman of the Committee gave evidence 
to the European Parliament Committee 
on Economic and 
Monetary Matters and Industrial 
Policy on the preparatory 
work for the move 
to the second and 
third stages 
of EMU. The Sub- Committee on Monetary Affairs 
was also briefed on the activities of the Committee 
of Governors. In December 1992, the 
Chairman presented 
the Committee's 
first Annual Report 
to the European Parliament 
in a plenary session. 
Secondly, the 
Chairman attended several ECOFIN Council meetings devoted 
either to 
the multilateral surveillance 
of member countries' economic policies 
or to other 
issues related 
to the Committee's activities. 
In addition, the Governors participated 
in the informal meetings of this Council, 
which provided an opportunity to express views 
on the mix between monetary, fiscal 
and other economic policies as 
well as on questions relating 
to the EMS 
and monetary relationships 
with third currencies. Furthermore, 
the Council was informed of progress made by the Committee of Governors in the preparations 
for the later 
stages of EMU. In December 1992, the Committee 
was consulted when the Council re- 
examined certain provisions in 
its Directive on the liberalisation of capital movements.4 
Thirdly, close co-operation 
with the Commission of the European Communities 
has continued. Commission representatives attended the meetings of the Committee of 
Governors and 
of the Committee 
of Alternates, as 
well as meetings of the Sub-Committees 
and Working Groups. 
The Committee of Governors is represented by delegates 
from national central banks in the Commission's Consultative 
Group on issues relating to payment systems. 
Fourthly, the Committee 
of Governors has contributed to the 
work of the 
Committee on Monetary, Financial 
and Balance-of-Payments Statistics which was created by 
a Council Decision 
in February 1991. A 
member of the Secretariat 
has permanent observer 
status on this Committee. 
In April 1992, the Committee 
of Governors was consulted on the Proposal from the Commission on the Community Statistical Programme 
for the 
next five 
years. Finally, the Committee 
of Governors has continued to follow closely the work of 
the Monetary Committee. Links 
with this Committee are ensured 
by the central bank 
representatives, who are, in 
most cases, 
the Alternates 
of the Governors. 
1.6. Relationships with central banks 
outside the Community 
Under the aegis 
of the Committee 
of Governors, information 
on developments in exchange markets 
is regularly exchanged 
between Community central banks and the central 
banks of the United States, 
Japan, Canada, Norway, 
Sweden, Finland, Austria 
and Switzerland. This so-called "concertation procedure" 
also provides for the pooling of relevant 
data, including intervention 
and other official foreign exchange transactions. 
In accordance with an undertaking dating 
back to 
1984, regular consultations on 
matters of common interest have 
been held with the central bank of Norway. The bilateral swap agreements 
which were concluded 
in December 1990 
between the Community central 
banks and Norges 
Bank were 
renewed at their 
maturity on 3 1st December 1992 
for a further 
one year period. 
In July 1992, arrangements for similar consultations were agreed 
with The so-called "monetary safeguard clause" 
provided for 
by Article 3 of Council 
Directive (881361lEEC) of 24th June 1988 which was subject to review 
before 3 1st December 1992. 
Suomen Pankki, the central bank 
of Finland; at the same time, the Community central banks 
and the Finnish central bank 
also concluded bilateral 
swap agreements. 
As in the case 
of Norway, these swap facilities give 
Suomen Pankki access 
to short-term funds 
for the implementation of its exchange rate 
policy and are governed by uniform terms and 
conditions. All agreements were 
maintained notwithstanding the fact that Finland (in 
September 1992) 
and Norway (in December 1992) 
suspended the peg 
of their respective 
currencies to the ECU. 
Against the background 
of the implementation 
of the European Economic Area 
(EEA), the Committee 
has also made arrangements 
for technical co-operation with the central 
banks of 
the EFTA 
countries in the 
statistical field. 1.7. Changes in the organisational structure 
of the Committee 
The Committee of Governors 
is assisted by the Committee of Alternates, the Sub- 
committees and Working Groups as 
well as by the Secretariat 
and the Economic Unit. 
The organisational structure created 
at the start 
of Stage One 
of EMU was described in the first 
Annual Report. 
This structure was strengthened further 
in 1992 to help lay the foundations 
for the move to the second 
and third stages 
of EMU. The Committee created four new Working Groups 
in the following areas: Issuing 
and Printing a European Bank-Note; Statistics; Information Systems; 
and Accounting Issues. 
Furthermore, the Committee 
decided to extend the 
mandate of the Working Group 
on EC Payment Systems 
which had been created 
in 1991 on an ad hoc basis. The task of the 
Working Groups 
is to prepare the 
discussions in the Committee of Governors 
in the respective areas 
on the basis 
of mandates from the Committee itself. 
The meetings of the 
Working Group 
on Statistics are 
also attended 
by a representative 
of the central banks 
of the EFTA countries. To support this 
Working Group, two task forces are being created 
in the fields of money and banking statistics 
and of 
balance-of-payments capital flows and stocks 
statistics, to carry forward 
work which is currently performed under the auspices 
of the Commission of the European Communities (Statistical Office). 
The preparatory work has also necessitated an enlargement of the Secretariat 
and of the Economic Unit to meet the increased 
demand for secretarial 
and analytical support. 
The number of staff thus increased from 
nineteen in April 1992 to 
twenty eight 
in April 1993. To facilitate internal management, 
two positions of senior professional staff members 
have been created. They head the Secretariat 
and the Economic Unit, respectively and report 
to the Secretary General. 
The present organisational structure of the Committee of Governors 
is shown in Chart

Sub-Committee Chairman: A. Borges 2. PREPARATORY WORK FOR THE MOVE TO THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF 
EMU 2.1. The timetable 
and general principles 
The Treaty on European Union stipulates that the Committee of Governors and 
the European Monetary Co-operation 
Fund (EMCF) will 
be superseded 
by the European 
Monetary Institute 
(EMI). Subject to the ratification 
of the Treaty, the Institute will 
be established and will 
take up its duties 
at the start 
of Stage Two 
on 1st January 1994. 
The objective of the EM1 is to contribute to the fulfilment of the conditions necessary 
for the transition to the third and 
final stage of EMU. To this end, the 
EM1 will, in particular: 
strengthen further the co-ordination 
of national monetary policies; 
make the preparations 
required for the establishment 
of the ESCB, for the conduct of 
a single monetary policy and 
the creation of a single currency in the third 
stage; and oversee the development of 
the ECU. In accordance with the Treaty, the 
necessary regulatory, organisational and 
logistical framework 
for the ESCB 
to perform its tasks has 
to be specified by the 
EM1 by the 
end of 1996 at the latest. 
The thorough preparation 
of this framework will require 
considerable time. 
A very broad agenda 
must be settled to 
ensure that the single monetary 
policy can 
be effectively conducted from the first 
day of 
the final stage. Issues to 
be addressed relate not only to the setting 
up of the ESCB and the definition of 
its "modus operandi", but include also questions linked 
to the technical requirements necessary 
for the realisation of a unified money market 
within the common monetary area. 
In some fields, the 
elaboration of concepts and the implementation 
of conclusions are expected 
to be particularly time-consuming. These include: the 
conceptual underpinnings of the single monetary policy 
and the methods 
for its implementation, including the choice of the appropriate monetary 
policy tools; the preparation 
of the bank notes denominated 
in ECU; the interconnection 
of the payment systems 
within the single monetary area; the creation 
of a consistent statistical 
base; and organisational aspects 
of the ESCB such 
as the harmonisation of accounting 
methodologies and the establishment 
of the information systems infrastructure. Rather 
than await the establishment 
of the EMI, it 
was considered 
prudent to commence preliminary work 
as soon as possible in these areas alongside the preparation for the start of 
Stage Two. As a first step, the Committee 
of Governors identified 
all the issues which should 
be examined at 
an early stage 
and established 
a work programme until the end of 1993. 
Thereafter, working methods were defined 
and the Committee's organisational structure 
was adapted. Special mandates were 
given to the existing Sub-Committees, Working Groups were 
created in specialised areas 
and the 
Secretariat and Economic Unit were enlarged. 
The substantive work started 
in the second half 
of 1992; most of this 
work has so far been of 
a fact-finding nature, creating 
a basis for the detailed consideration of options at 
a later stage. 
As in the past, the Committee (and 
subsequently the EMI) will 
report regularly to the 
Community authorities 
on the progress made. The public 
will be kept informed through 
public authorities, other bodies governed 
by public law, 
or public undertakings of Member 
States" as well as the purchase 
of debt instruments directly from them 
by the ECB 
or national central banks. 
These provisions are 
designed to eliminate the risk that central banks (and the 
future ECB) are put under pressure 
to provide financial assistance to the public sector which 
would render the conduct 
of monetary policy more difficult 
and could jeopardise the 
attainment of price stability. 
This prohibition will take effect at the beginning of 
Stage  TWO.^ Compliance with Article 104 will necessitate changes in national practices 
and legislation (see Table 
8). In this context, the Committee of Governors 
is examining in particular the following issues: the treatment 
of outstanding central bank claims 
on public entities; how to ensure full compliance 
with the prohibition of central bank credit 
to the public sector; 
the implications of the prohibition for the functioning 
of payment systems; and 
the need for clarification of such issues by 
secondary Community legislation in accordance 
with Article 
104b(2). The conclusions of the Committee 
of Governors will be taken into account by the Commission 
when it presents a 
proposal for such legislation. The Committee also intends to follow closely the 
changes in national legislation which the Member States are 
currently preparing 
or implementing, and to establish a procedure whereby central banks' 
operations with public entities 
would be regularly monitored 
in the framework of the future 
EMI. 2.3 Areas of work with a long lead time 
While work in the areas 
with a long 
lead time are essentially related 
to the foundations of 
Stage Three 
of EMU, some 
of the issues under study, 
such as payment systems 
questions, are 
also of importance in the 
context of Stage Two. 
Conduct of a single monetary 
policy and harmonisation of monetary policy 
instruments The manner in 
which the single 
monetary policy is to be conducted 
is not defined 
in the Statute of the ESCB. 
A large margin of discretion is left to the ECB, which 
will allow it considerable flexibility to adjust its methods 
to the prevailing circumstances, 
as the conditions under 
which it will operate cannot yet be fully ascertained. Significant structural 
changes are expected to occur following 
the creation 
of the Single Market, while Monetary 
Union itself may lead 
to further major 
changes. Nevertheless, given the complexity of the 
task of elaborating the future monetary strategy, 
it is necessary to 
start the groundwork 
as soon as possible. The Committee of Governors has identified three main topics which need to 
be considered. Firstly, the possible concepts 
of the single monetary policy should 
be studied, focusing in particular 
on the choice, definition, 
and appropriateness of intermediate objectives 
In accordance with Section 
11 of the Protocol relating to the 
United Kingdom, 
the government 
may maintain its "ways and 
means" facility with the Bank of England 
if and 
so long 
as the United 
Kingdom does not move to the Third Stage. 
TABLE 8: CENTRAL BANK FINANCING OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR (a) According to Maastricht Treaty, Article 104. 
The facilities will be legally abolished 
by June 1993 at the latest Changes in government's current 
account occur due to 
changes in net government borrowing 
abroad. Changes in 
government's current account occur only due 
to exchange rate fluctuations 
recorded in central bank's currency 
reserves. 1) The Luxembourg government has 
an overdraft facility 
with the Central Bank 
of Belgium , subject to a ceiling. 
2) In addition, the issue of notes and coins by the Institute 
Monetaire Luxembourgeois (IML) provides the government with 
-limited- liquid funds directly, against a non-callable 
claim of 
the IML on the government. 
The overdraft facility was eliminated at the end 
of 1992. The 
outstanding balance was 
consolidated into 
a ten-year loan. The flow figure 
for 1991 
reflects the increase in the 
upper limit 
of the overdraft 
facility. Ceiling was reduced 
to 5% from 10% from the beginning of 
1993. Purchases were sharply reduced 
to 0.1% of GDP in 1992. This figure 
reflects very large exceptional transactions related to 
the restructuring of monetary policy instruments and 
procedures. Net credit to the Public 
Sector actually declined 
during 1991.

The examination of this issue 
will involve an assessment of 
the relative merits of alternative target 
variables. A second issue relates 
to the methods 
and organisational aspects of executing 
monetary policy operations. 
This aspect essentially 
concerns the division of responsibilities 
between the 
ECB and the national 
central banks. 
The Statute states that the 
ECB shall have recourse to 
the national central banks to carry 
out operations "to the extent deemed possible 
and appropriate". 
The practical implications of this provision must 
be studied in the light 
of the other objectives of 
the ESCB. Thirdly, monetary 
policy instruments will have to be considered 
for the implementation of 
the single monetary policy. 
It is important that choices 
are made 
to promote the necessary degree 
of harmonisation of instruments sufficiently ahead of the start 
of Stage Three 
in order 
to guarantee that markets are familiar 
with the new procedures and 
practices when the ESCB takes up its 
full functions. The Committee of Governors has 
so far given priority to the third issue. It has 
embarked on a comprehensive fact-finding review 
of the similarities and differences 
in monetary policy instruments currently 
used in Community countries. 
This review covers both 
the range 
of available instruments (i.e. discretionary 
open market operations, standing 
facilities offered by 
central banks at 
pre-announced rates and used on the commercial 
banks' initiative, and compulsory reserve 
requirements) and the procedures according 
to which they 
are used. 
In the latter respect the 
Committee is studying the frequency of operations, their 
terms and conditions and the 
range of market participants 
with which 
they are concluded. 
A short summary of the preliminary 
work is reported in Chapter 
11. Printing and issuing a 
European Bank-Note The Treaty confers 
upon the ECB 
and the national central banks 
the exclusive right of issuing bank notes 
which are legal tender 
within the Community. 
In preparation for 
this function, the 
EM1 is entrusted with the task of supervising the technical planning for the 
introduction of ECU bank notes. 
Experience at national 
level suggests that 
the development and introduction of a 
new bank note series normally 
takes several years. 
At the Community level, matters are 
expected to be 
even more complex. Additional elements to be taken into consideration 
include the much larger stock of notes 
which must be replaced by new ECU-denominated 
bank notes, and the differences 
between Community 
countries in payment habits and systems 
for the production, issuance 
and post-issue 
handling of bank notes. For these reasons, 
it was deemed wise to undertake a fact-finding 
exercise at 
an early stage to gauge the 
nature and likely magnitude of potential problems. A 
survey is consequently being undertaken covering 
the printing, circulation, issuing, handling, sorting 
and destruction of bank 
notes in the 
Community. The legal aspects 
of issuing bank notes are also under examination. 
Furthermore, conceptual work has started in several areas. Firstly, a number of 
options relating 
to the appearance of the new 
bank notes are under consideration. Broadly 
speaking, there 
are three possibilities: identical bank notes in 
all Member States; common 
bank notes 
with national characteristics; 
or national bank notes 
with European characteristics. 
These options are currently being 
evaluated from various angles, including public 
acceptability and recognition, as 
well as the implications for the automation of 
note issuing and handling. 
A further criterion 
will be economies 
of scale in design, production 
and distribution costs. 
Secondly, the Committee 
of Governors is considering issues relating to the 
general features 
of the new 
bank notes including their face values, design 
and size. These aspects are being examined against the background 
of the security technology necessary 
to prevent counterfeiting 
and the features required for automation of the post-issue handling 
process. A third main area under 
consideration relates to the legal, institutional 
and organisational aspects 
of the issuing and post-issue handling 
of notes, in particular the 
distribution of responsibilities in this respect 
between the ECB 
and the national central banks. 
Several options are conceivable 
and their relative merits 
will be analysed on 
the basis of 
efficiency and 
cost criteria. Finally, preliminary studies have 
been undertaken on transitional issues. 
Two options can be envisaged for the launching 
of new bank notes. 
A first option would provide 
for a "big bang", i.e. the new 
bank notes would be introduced at a given date, replacing the 
bank notes denominated 
in national currencies 
within a short period of time. 
The second option would consist 
of a more 
gradual introduction of the new bank 
notes which would circulate alongside the bank notes denominated 
in national currencies during a transitional 
period. These two options will need further examination 
from various viewpoints: their 
contribution to introducing the single currency 
within a time horizon deemed appropriate by 
the political authorities; the underpinning 
of the credibility 
and acceptance of the future 
single currency; the costs involved for economic 
agents; and 
aspects of practical feasibility. 
Furthermore, the introduction of 
new bank 
notes has also to 
be seen in the context of the 
transition to the ECU 
as the single currency 
of the common monetary area. 
The Committee of Governors, therefore, 
will carry out its 
work (as will the EMI) 
in close co-operation 
with other competent Community bodies. 
In particular, the 
Council has been given the power 
to take the legal measures necessary for the rapid introduction 
of the ECU as the 
single currency 
after the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates 
on the starting date 
of Stage Three. Paym end systems The Committee of Governors is focusing on the implications 
for payment systems 
of both 
the completion of the Single 
Market and the realisation 
of a common monetary area at 
the beginning 
of Stage Three. Financial integration 
is expected to increase the volume of 
cross-border flows in the Single Market. 
In addition, in accordance with the Second Banking 
Co-ordination Directive, 
any bank licensed in a Member State may provide "money 
transmission services" anywhere in the 
Community and 
thus must 
be given access to 
interbank funds transfer systems 
in other Community countries 
on an equal footing 
with the respective domestic banks. 
Monetary unification will necessitate the connection 
of existing payment systems to ensure that 
monetary conditions are the same throughout the area. 
The importance of payment systems for the conduct 
of monetary policy 
is recognised in the Treaty which assigns the 
task of promoting "the 
smooth operation of payment systems" to the 
ESCB. In this respect, the ECB 
is empowered to 
issue regulations 
to ensure efficient and 
sound clearing 
and payment systems 
within the Community and with 
other countries. 
The work of the Committee 
of Governors builds 
on studies made by an ad 
hoc group of experts 
which was established 
in 1991 to 
undertake an extensive survey of payment 
systems in the Community. 
The results of this review were presented in a document entitled 
"Payment Systems in 
EC Member States" (also 
known as the "Blue Book"). 
This was published by the Committee of Governors in September 1992, to meet the growing demands 
of interested third parties 
for a reference guide 
to payment 
systems in the Community. 
The Committee of Governors identified 
several issues of common concern 
to central banks. 
These relate mainly 
to large value funds transfer systems 
and are now under further consideration. 
Firstly, commonly 
accepted principles for the co-operative oversight of payment 
systems in the 
Community are being developed. The co-operative supervision will apply to 
cross-border netting and payment 
systems as well as to the participation of 
EC registered banks in domestic payment systems of countries 
in which 
they do 
not have either their 
headquarters or a branch. Under the 
Second Banking Co-ordination Directive, the home 
country supervisory authorities 
will have sole responsibility for the financial integrity 
of the banks licensed by them. 
This responsibility extends to 
branches in other 
EC countries. The host country authorities 
will thus no longer automatically receive all of the information 
needed to evaluate the financial 
condition of some participants in their domestic payment 
systems; home supervisors could, in turn, lack 
adequate information on risks taken by credit institutions through their participation in 
other EC domestic 
payment systems. 
As a result, 
central banks and other supervisors 
will have to co-ordinate the oversight of participants. 
Secondly, possibilities for establishing 
and implementing minimum common 
standards for domestic systems are 
being examined. These include: setting consistent 
minimum conditions for access 
to interbank 
funds transfer systems; the consideration of risk 
reduction measures 
to be applied to the major 
interbank systems; and 
studying measures 
to reduce risks in cross-border payments resulting 
from differences in national legal systems. 
The objective is to improve the smoothness 
of cross-border payments in the Community 
while avoiding the risk 
of competitive pressures lowering the degree 
of integrity and safety of 
the major interbank funds transfer 
systems. Thirdly, the 
design of an EC-wide large value funds transfer system 
is being studied. Such a system 
is indispensable for the efficient conduct 
of the single monetary policy 
in Stage Three. 
The time and resources required 
to design and 
implement a fully integrated 
system are 
such that this issue has 
to be addressed at a very early stage. Early knowledge 
of the design of 
the infrastructure will also 
help the 
EC banking community 
plan for the future. Moreover, payment systems are 
not exclusively run by central banks but are 
partly organised 
by the banking industry itself. 
An effective dialogue 
with the banking 
community in the EC is, therefore, essential. 
Such a dialogue was initiated in November when the Committee's Working Group 
on EC Payment Systems met representatives 
of the European Banking Federations 
and of major commercial banks. The Committee is also liaising with the European Committee for Banking Standards created recently under 
the aegis of the European Banking Federations. 
Finally, the ECU clearing 
system will continue to 
be monitored closely 
(see Section IV. 1). Statistics Reliable and timely statistics are 
a vital prerequisite for the conduct of monetary 
policy. The Statute of the ESCB entitles the ECB, 
assisted by the national central banks, 
to collect the necessary statistics. Moreover, the 
ECB will 
contribute to the harmonisation, 
where necessary, 
of the rules 
and practices governing the collection, compilation and 
distribution of statistics in the areas 
within its field 
of competence. The EM1 will promote this 
harmonisation in the context 
of its preparatory 
work. The Committee of Governors has 
set in motion the process of improving the 
statistical information 
needed for the 
co-ordination of monetary policies, and 
has started to 
define the statistical base 
necessary for the 
conduct of the single monetary policy. 
As a first step, the statistical requirements 
of the EM1 and the ECB need to be clarified; once identified, 
they will be compared with the available 
national data. This comparison will subsequently provide a basis for the analytical 
work necessary to 
underpin the construction of reliable 
statistics for the common monetary 
area and will 
facilitate the assessment of whether 
adjustments to current data 
collection systems 
are needed. 
Three principles play an important role in the appraisal 
of future statistical requirements: the minimisation 
of the reporting burden on financial institutions; the optimal 
use of the infrastructure of national central banks; and the compatibility 
with Community and international statistical standards. 
At this early 
stage, it 
is also important to maintain 
a degree of flexibility. Room must 
be left for adaptations in the light 
of the yet to be defined concept 
of the single monetary policy, the harmonisation 
of monetary policy instruments and the 
likely changes in the structure 
and the functioning 
of financial markets. 
The Committee of Governors co-operates closely 
with the competent Community 
institutions and international bodies 
in the statistical field. This co-operation takes 
place in the 
framework of the Committee 
on Monetary, Financial and 
Balance-of-Payments Statistics. 
Accounting principles of national central banks The harmonisation of accounting rules 
and practices of national central banks 
is not only 
an indispensable prerequisite for the conduct 
of a single monetary policy, 
but also for the application of the ESCB Statute's 
provision on monetary income 
and foreign exchange 
transfers. The Statute entitles the Governing 
Council to 
"establish the necessary rules 
for standardising the accounting 
and reporting of operations undertaken 
by the national central 
banks". This undertaking is expected to be very complex 
as the methods and practices reflect 
different national traditions 
and legal 
provisions. The preliminary work undertaken 
by the Committee of Governors 
has so far been 
of a fact finding nature. 
An inventory of accounting methodologies currently applied 
by the central banks 
has been prepared. Particular 
attention was 
paid to three aspects: the 
institutional and legal context 
in which the accounts of the central banks are produced; the 
comparison and classification 
of items in the balance sheets 
and profit and loss accounts of 
the central banks; 
and the identification 
of the similarities 
and differences in 
the accounting treatment of these items, especially 
where they 
are thought 
to be relevant to the 
EM1 and the 
ESCB. On the basis of this inventory 
the Committee of Governors will carry out preparatory 
work for the harmonisation 
of accounting rules 
and standards. It will also take into 
consideration, where appropriate, 
Community legislation 
in this field. 
In formation systems 
The EM1 and the ECB will need reliable information systems. These systems must communicate efficiently 
with those in national 
central banks. In 
Stage Two, 
the exchange of information 
will mainly concern statistical data; 
in Stage Three, it 
will extend to 
operational functions. 
Against this background, 
it was felt necessary to 
embark on the definition of a 
technical strategy 
for information and communication 
systems for the EM1 and the ESCB. 
Two preliminary steps have 
so far been taken. 
Firstly, technical surveys are currently 
being made in order to take stock of the 
present information system infrastructures 
in the Community central banks. Secondly, the 
information and communication 
systems requirements of the EM1 and of the ESCB are being 
evaluated in the light of the various 
tasks of the 
new institutions. The results of the surveys as 
well as of the analysis of requirements, will provide 
the basis 
for preparing both 
the information systems 
infrastructure for the EM1 and the ECB and for the connection of systems 
of the central banks. ANNEXES ANNEX I: Changes in monetary policy instruments 
and procedures since the start 
of Stage One 
ANNEX 11: Institutional status of 
central banks in Community countries 
Annex I CHANGES IN MONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENTS AND PROCEDURES SINCE 
THE START OF STAGE ONE 
Since the start 
of Stage One 
of EMU 
in July 1990, major changes 
in the techniques for executing monetary policy operations have 
been introduced in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece and Portugal. This 
section briefly describes these changes. 
Belgium Prior to January 199 1, monetary 
policy in Belgium relied almost entirely on the 
setting of the interest 
rate on Treasury bills. The 
central bank had discretion 
to set the rate 
in consultation with the Minister of Finance. The size 
of the Treasury bill market and the facility 
to issue bills "on tap" 
(i.e. Treasury bills 
were regularly available 
to banks upon request) 
allowed the central 
bank to exercise close 
control over 
short-term market interest rates. 
The system, however, had some drawbacks. In particular, monetary policy had to rely on a single 
instrument. The instrument also had a highly visible budgetary impact which could restrict 
the scope for adjusting interest rates flexibly. 
Finally, by reducing their portfolio in Treasury 
bills, banks were able 
to pass on liquidity shortages to 
the Treasury which, 
in turn, had to 
adjust its position by resorting 
to central bank credit 
facilities. The monetary reform introduced 
in January 1991 had two major components. 
On the one hand, measures were 
taken to enhance competition in the primary market 
for short- term public securities. In particular, 
the issuing 
of Treasury bills 
"on tap" 
was replaced by a 
system of periodic auctions, 
which are open to 
a wide range of investors. Measures were 
also adopted to develop an efficient secondary market. On the other hand, the 
central bank no longer sets the leading money market 
rate administratively, but rather conducts interest 
rate policy 
through interventions 
on the money 
market. Firstly, it uses periodic allocations 
of credit by tender which 
supply liquidity 
to the market on a routine basis. 
The interest rate 
applied also 
signals the stance 
of monetary policy. 
Secondly, between allocations, the 
central bank conducts open market operations 
on a daily 
basis to manage liquidity conditions. Thirdly, a deposit facility 
and an overdraft facility are 
available to 
meet individual end-of-day liquidity surpluses 
and deficits, respectively. 
The interest rates applied 
to these facilities 
also provide a lower limit 
and an upper limit to very 
short-term market rates. Finally, the 
central bank uses two official rates: the discount rate, 
applied to the mobilisation 
of a small amount 
of commercial bills, and 
the interest rate on advances above a pre-set amount. These rates are primarily 
of a symbolic 
nature and are 
normally used to announce a change 
in policy, for example when other central banks change 
their official interest rates. 
Annex I Denmark Prior to 
April 1992, the Danmarks Nationalbank offered 
two standing facilities: 
an unlimited deposit facility 
to absorb excess liquidity in the money market; and a limited 
overdraft facility to supply liquidity. 
The interest rates applied 
on these facilities were linked 
to the official discount rate. 
In practice, this approach 
limited the flexibility of policy. 
On 1st April 1992, the Danmarks 
Nationalbank consequently introduced a new 
system to enhance operational flexibility. 
Under the new 
procedure, two-week certificates 
of deposit are issued by the 
central bank 
on a regular 
weekly basis. To ensure that banks have 
sufficient surplus liquidity 
to purchase certificates 
of deposits, Danmarks Nationalbank will, 
if necessary, supply liquidity 
through repos in government paper. 
The interest rate on the 
certificates steers short-term market rates. The 
Bank may buy 
back certificates 
when there is a need to supply liquidity. 
At the same time, 
the overdraft facility 
was suppressed and the deposit facility 
restricted. The amount of deposits which banks may 
hold at the 
central bank on which interest 
is paid has been limited to a monthly 
average of 5% of their own funds. Deposits in excess 
of this percentage are 
no longer remunerated. The averaging provision for the remunerated 
element partly helps 
to limit the variability 
of very 
short-term market rates. 
Germany The Deutsche Bundesbank 
issued liquidity paper 
with three-, six-, and nine-month 
maturities for the first 
time on 1st March 1993. The issue 
was launched in accordance 
with a newly introduced section 
42 of the Deutsche Bundesbank Act, pursuant to 
which the Bundesbank may issue Treasury 
discount paper 
of the Federal Republic of Germany up 
to the maximum amount 
of DM 50 billion for its own account. Issues 
of this kind serve 
as a monetary policy instrument 
and do 
not imply a financing 
of any public budget. 
The issue of 
liquidity paper 
is directly connected 
both in 
time and 
substance with a substantial relaxation 
of the prevailing minimum reserve requirements. It implies 
an extension of the set 
of monetary policy instruments 
and should strengthen 
the competitiveness of German 
commercial banks. From a monetary 
policy point of view, this instrument enhances the 
flexibility in the execution 
of monetary policy insofar as, for instance, it permits a better 
response to the liquidity effects 
of turbulence in the foreign exchange markets and allows the 
central bank 
to influence non-banks' 
cash holdings directly. Following the introduction 
of this instrument, the central bank 
now has a 
broader range of open-market policy options at its 
disposal. Annex I Greece In December 1992, the 
Bank of 
Greece announced the introduction of two new 
instruments for providing liquidity 
to the banking system, namely 
a Lombard-type facility, 
against collateral 
of government paper, 
and a rediscount facility 
for commercial bills. 
Both facilities are subject to overall 
quotas which are allocated among credit institutions according 
to criteria relating 
to the size 
of certain balance sheet items. The interest rates on these 
two facilities are meant to provide a corridor within which 
money market rates fluctuate. 
The already existing overdraft facility 
is maintained as 
a means of last resort assistance at penalty 
rates. In addition, in order to enhance the flexibility 
of liquidity management, auctions 
for currency swaps have 
been introduced since 
November 1992. The recent measures are 
intended to consolidate the use 
of market-oriented mechanisms in the conduct 
of monetary policy and thus 
increase its effectiveness. 
Portugal To improve the efficiency 
of monetary policy, open money market operations 
became the main instrument for regulating 
money market conditions in Portugal in January 
1991. Under the new system, 
central bank 
intervention is centred on the reserve requirement 
provisions of banks. 
The provisions must be fulfilled on average over 
a period of about one 
week. Periodic 
open market operations provide 
a channel to 
supply and withdraw liquidity 
on a regular basis 
and the rates set 
by the Banco de Portugal indicate the orientation of monetary 
policy. These operations take place 
on the first working day 
of each maintenance period. 
The Bank may also resort 
to occasional 
open market operations during the reserve period 
to stabilise very short-term interest rates. 
Both types of operation are conducted 
at short-term maturities (up 
to one week). Initially, 
they were 
undertaken principally with 
repos in domestic Treasury bills. 
However, since mid-1991, operations 
to drain liquidity 
have mainly been carried out by issuing 
central bank certificates. The central bank 
also offers 
a lending facility on the last working 
day of 
the weekly maintenance period 
to allow banks short of 
funds to meet the reserve requirements. This facility is available 
for overnight funds and 
granted at 
a penalty rate. 
The Banco de Portugal also conducts 
liquidity-absorbing operations at longer 
maturities, given the existence 
of a structural liquidity surplus in the money 
market. At the end of March 1991, the 
system of remuneration of reserve requirements 
was changed. Reserve requirements 
on new liabilities (increments over and above the stock at 
end-1990) are now remunerated 
at near market rates 
to eliminate the implicit 
tax involved in holding non-remunerated reserves. 
Annex I1 INSTITUTIONAL STATUS 
OF CENTRAL BANKS IN 
COMMUNITY COUNTRIES 1. NATIONAL BANK OF BELGIUM 1.1. Objectives and tasks 
No explicit statutory objectives are laid down. 
The main tasks 
are: monetary and exchange rate policy; management of official 
reserves; European and international monetary co-operation; 
and safeguarding the smooth 
functioning of payment systems. Other tasks are conferred 
on the Bank 
under specific legislative provisions. 
The National Bank is not responsible 
for banking supervision. 
1.2. Governing bodies 
The Bank is directed by the Governor and 
administered by the Board of Directors 
assisted by the Council 
of Regency. It is supervised by the Board 
of Censors. There is, in 
addition, the General Council. 
The Governor is appointed by the 
Crown (on a nomination 
from the 
Government) for a renewable term 
of five years. The Governor can 
be suspended 
or dismissed by the Crown; this 
has never happened. 
The Board of Directors includes, in addition to the Governor, three to six 
members appointed 
by the Crown on the proposal of the Council of Regency for a term of six years. The Board manages the Bank 
and is in charge of the orientation of policy under the 
control of the Council 
of Regency. The Council of Regency includes the Governor, the Directors and 
the Regents. Regents are appointed for three 
years by the general meeting 
of shareholders (the Belgian State owns 
50% of the shares). Five are 
appointed on the proposal of the Minister of Finance 
and five on the proposal of the 
most representative organisations 
of industry, commerce, 
agriculture and labour. 
It has general powers 
to set the rate 
and terms of discount, advances 
and loans and 
draws up the balance sheet. 
The Board of Censors includes eight 
to ten 
Censors elected 
for three years 
by the general meeting 
of shareholders. Besides controlling the operations 
of the Bank, it votes 
on the budget as proposed by the Council 
of Regency and 
approves the annual accounts. 
Annex I1 The General Council includes the Governor, the Directors, 
the Regents and the 
Censors. It has important administrative functions. 
While there 
is no 
right of instruction from political authorities, there 
is a Government commissioner in the Bank. 
A power of suspension and 
a right 
to oppose can be exercised respectively by the Government 
commissioner and 
the Minister 
of Finance against 
any decision 
of the Bank contrary 
to the law, 
the statutes of the central bank and the interests 
of the State, but this power was 
abolished in March 
1993 with respect to all the central bank's 
decisions and operations concerning its basic 
tasks. 1.3. Independence in the formulation and implementation of monetary 
and exchange rate policy The Bank is responsible for the 
formulation and 
implementation of monetary 
policy. Monetary policy 
is conducted in the context of the exchange rate regime 
which is determined by the 
Government. In particular, exchange rate arrangements are adopted 
by the Crown (the Government) after 
consultation with the Bank. The monetary policy reform 
of January 1991 
led to a substantial change in 
operating procedures 
(see Annex I of this Report 
for a description). Since then, the 
Bank can 
use a wide range 
of monetary policy instruments: however, the introduction of reserve 
requirements needs the approval 
of the Government. The 1991 reform also included a 
substantial limitation 
of central bank 
financing of the Government. Due 
to the new legislation 
adopted in March 1993, "monetary financing" 
will be completely abolished by June 1993 
at the latest. 
1.4. Democratic accountability and 
transparency There are no institutionalised relations 
between the Parliament and the Bank, 
and indeed the Governor 
has rarely appeared before Parliament. Regarding relations 
with the Government, the Governor 
has only rarely attended meetings of the Council 
of Ministers. In 
addition to the role of the Government 
in the appointment procedure described above, the 
Minister of Finance has 
to approve the 
presentation of the weekly financial statements of the 
Bank. Finally, the Bank publishes 
an Annual Report. 1.5. Prospective institutional changes 
After the adoption 
of the new legislation 
in March 1993 strengthening central 
bank independence 
and prohibiting "monetary financing", no more 
changes are currently 
planned. Annex I1 2. DANMARKS NATIONALBANK 2.1. Objectives 
and tasks 
The statutory objective 
is to maintain 
a safe and secure currency system 
and to facilitate and regulate payment flows 
and the extension 
of credit. The main tasks are the conduct 
of monetary policy and exchange 
rate management. The Bank also manages official reserves and serves as fiscal agent 
of the central 
government but 
is not the banking 
supervisory authority. 2.2. Governing bodies The governing bodies are the Board 
of Governors, the Board 
of Directors, and the Committee of Directors. 
The Board of Governors has three members. 
The Chairman is appointed by the 
Crown and the other 
two members are elected by the 
Board of Directors. There is no 
term of 
office. In practice, appointments are for life, 
with a retirement age 
of 70. The Board is fully responsible for the Bank's monetary 
policy decisions. 
The Board of Directors has twenty five members of 
which two are appointed by 
the Royal Bank 
Commissioner, i.e. the Minister 
of Economic Affairs, eight by Parliament 
from among its members, while the remaining fifteen members are appointed 
by the Board to 
ensure a broad representation 
of economic life. The 
term is five years with 
a possibility of re-election. The Board is competent in administrative and organisational fields. 
The Committee of Directors consists 
of the two members of the Board 
of Directors appointed by the 
Royal Bank Commissioner 
and five members elected 
by and from among the members of the 
Board of Directors. The term is one year with a possibility of 
re-election. The Committee also has administrative 
and organisational responsibilities. 
The Royal Bank Commissioner 
monitors the 
Bank's observance of 
its legal obligations and constitutes the formal link 
between the Bank and 
the Government. 
The members of the governing bodies are not subject 
to instructions from political authorities. 2.3. Independence in the formulation 
and implementation 
of monetary and 
exchange rate 
policy The monetary policy authority rests 
with the Bank's Board of Governors, which 
determines the framework for monetary policy, including interest rates. 
By tradition, monetary policy 
has been formulated on the basis of concertation between the Bank and the 
Government. The Board of Governors has 
full freedom in implementing monetary policy 
and in setting instruments. In addition, Denmark fully abides 
by the "monetary financing" 
prohibition as laid 
down in the Maastricht Treaty. The 
central government finances budget 
deficits by selling government paper 
in the market. 
Annex I1 The exchange rate policy is set by the Government in concertation with the Bank. 
Management of exchange rate developments rests 
with the Bank. 
2.4. Democratic accountability 
and transparency 
Accountability is provided for 
through the composition of the Board of Directors 
and the Committee of Directors 
and through a 
special provision 
stipulating that the Royal 
Bank Commissioner 
and the Minister 
of Finance are entitled 
to take part in deliberations 
on changes in the official discount rate, 
but without voting rights. Moreover, the Bank 
is statutorily obliged to 
publish its annual accounts, 
when approved by the Board of Directors 
and the Royal Bank Commissioner, 
together with an Annual 
Report. 2.5. Prospective institutional 
changes There are no plans for institutional 
changes. 3. DEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK 
3.1. Objectives and 
tasks The Deutsche Bundesbank is the currency 
and note-issuing bank of the Federal 
Republic of Germany. Its principal objective 
is to safeguard the currency. 
The Bank is obliged to support the Government's 
general economic policy, but without prejudice to the 
principal objective. 
The Bank provides banks 
with payment system services and manages 
official reserves. 
It is not responsible for 
banking supervision. 3.2. Governing bodies 
The governing bodies are the 
Central Bank 
Council, the Directorate and the 
Managing Boards of the Land 
Central Banks 
(Main Offices which have competence in the respective Lander). The Central Bank 
Council (with a 
maximum of seventeen members) consists of 
the President and the Deputy President 
of the Bundesbank, the other 
members of the 
Directorate and the Presidents 
of the Land Central 
Banks. The Central Bank Council 
determines the monetary and credit policy 
of the Bank and 
is the supreme internal organ. 
The Directorate comprises the President, the 
Deputy President and up to 
six (currently five) further members. 
All members of the Directorate are appointed 
by the President of 
the Federal Republic on the proposal of the Federal Government after 
consultation with the Central 
Bank Council. The Directorate 
is responsible for implementing the monetary and credit policy 
decisions of the Central Bank 
Council. The Directorate also directs and administers the Bank, 
except in matters falling 
within the competence 
of the Managing Boards of the 
Land Central Banks. Within this 
framework, the Directorate is 
responsible for transactions as 
fiscal agent 
for the 
Federal Government and 
as provider of 
cash advances to it and its 
special funds, for transactions 
with certain 
credit institutions, for 
Annex I1 foreign exchange 
and external transactions, for 
open market operations and 
for co-ordination tasks within 
the Bundesbank as a whole. The Managing Boards 
of the nine 
Land Central 
Banks consist of the President, the 
Vice-President and 
in some cases one further member. The Presidents 
of the Land Central Banks are appointed by the President 
of the Federal Republic on the proposal 
of the Bundesrat (upper chamber of parliament), following submission 
of a proposal 
from the competent Land governments and after consultation 
with the Central 
Bank Council. The Land Central Banks carry out transactions 
with the public authorities 
and credit institutions located 
in their area. 
Members of the governing bodies 
of the Bank are appointed 
for a period 
of eight years. In exceptional 
cases, appointments may be shorter, but 
with a two year minimum. 
Generally, appointments are renewable. 
The Bank and the members of 
its governing bodies 
are independent of instructions from the 
Federal Government in the execution of 
the tasks assigned to them under the Bundesbank Act. 
3.3. Independence in the formulation and implementation of monetary and 
exchange rate 
policy Monetary and credit policy 
is determined by the Central Bank Council 
on its own authority. A provision specifies that the 
adoption of monetary policy decisions 
by the 
Central Bank Council may 
be deferred for 
up to two weeks 
on the request of the Federal Government. 
Hitherto, the Federal Government has not 
exercised this power. In any event, the final 
decision rests with the Central Bank 
Council. The instruments of monetary policy are determined 
by the Bundesbank Act. 
Within this statutory framework the 
Bank may 
employ, develop and 
refine the 
monetary policy instruments 
at its discretion. There 
is no binding obligation 
to grant credit to 
the public sector. The Bank "is permitted" to grant credits to the 
Federal and 
Land governments and to 
certain other public authorities, but 
only at 
short term and 
subject to statutory ceilings. 
Interest is currently levied at the respective Lombard rate, 
which is quite close 
to the market interest rate level. The Bank operates 
in the foreign exchange market on 
its own authority. However, 
it is the Federal Government that sets 
central rates, albeit 
in consultation with 
the Bank. 3.4. Democratic accountability and 
transparency The independence of the Bundesbank as stipulated in the Bundesbank 
Act rests on a social consensus in favour 
of a policy geared to price stability. 
The Bank has no 
obligation to report to Parliament 
and the Federal Government, but it regularly informs the public 
through publications 
and speeches. The 
annual accounts are verified 
by auditors and by 
the Federal Audit Office. 
Annex I1 3.5. Prospective institutional 
changes There are currently no plans for 
institutional changes. 4. BANK OF GREECE 4.1. Objectives and 
tasks The statutory objective 
is to control 
the currency in circulation and credit. 
This is considered to imply that monetary stability 
is the ultimate objective 
of the Bank. 
The main tasks are 
the implementation 
of monetary and exchange rate policies in accordance with the general guidelines 
set by the Government. 
The Bank has the exclusive 
right to issue bank notes 
and manages official 
reserves. In addition, the 
Bank is the 
banking supervisory authority and plays a 
key role in the country's 
payment systems. 
4.2. Governing bodies 
The General Council consists 
of the Governor, the Deputy Governors and nine 
non-executive Counsellors. 
The Governor and the Deputy Governors are appointed 
for a renewable four-year term by the 
Government following a 
proposal of the General Council, 
while the nine Counsellors are elected by the General Meeting 
of Shareholders for a renewable three-year term. 
The Council is entrusted with 
the general conduct 
of the affairs of the Bank. 
The Governor is the chief executive 
of the Bank. He or, in 
his absence, a Deputy 
Governor presides over the 
General Council, legally represents 
the Bank and, 
on behalf of the Council, decides upon 
all matters not 
specifically reserved to the General Council. 
A non-voting Government 
Commissioner can be nominated by the Minister 
of Finance. He attends the General Meeting 
of the Shareholders and the meetings of 
the General Council and can veto decisions if he considers them to be contrary to the Statutes 
of the Bank 
or the laws of the State. 
4.3. Independence in the formulation and implementation 
of monetary and 
exchange rate 
policy The Bank formulates monetary policy 
on the basis of the Government's 
macroeconomic objectives. 
The Bank enjoys considerable freedom in adopting monetary 
targets and in implementing monetary policy. 
However, the setting of policy instruments 
is constrained by the 
fact that the interest rate 
on government paper is administratively set 
by the Government, although 
in consultation with the Bank. Finally, although 
the Bank is currently obliged 
to provide overdraft facilities 
to the Government, the amount 
is in 
practice limited. Exchange rate policy is formulated by the Government 
in consultation with the Bank, which in turn 
is responsible for its implementation. 
Annex I1 4.4. Democratic accountability 
and transparency There is a 
competent parliamentary committee 
which expresses an opinion regarding the suitability 
of candidates proposed for appointment as Governor. Transparency 
is ensured by 
the publication of an Annual Report and certain financial statements. 
4.5. Prospective institutional changes 
The Bank of Greece has proposed to 
the Government legislative changes 
concerning its objectives and main tasks, independence, organisational structure, and 
monetary functions 
and operations. The proposed 
legislation aims at increasing the degree 
of independence of the Bank in the near future and making its Statute compatible 
with the Maastricht Treaty. 5. BANCO DE ESPHA 5.1. Objectives and tasks 
The Bank is entrusted with the implementation of monetary policy 
with a view, in particular, to safeguarding the 
value of the currency. 
The main tasks of the Bank are: the 
implementation of internal and external 
monetary policy; the issuing 
of bank notes 
and the regulation of their circulation; the 
ownership and management of official reserves; 
and the supervision 
of banking institutions 
and of certain financial markets. The 
Bank also acts 
as fiscal agent 
of the Government and 
advisor to the Government 
on financial and economic matters. 
5.2. Governing bodies 
The governing bodies comprise the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the General 
Council and the Executive Council. 
The Governor is appointed by the Crown on a proposal of the President 
of the Government for a 
renewable four-year term. The 
Governor represents the 
Bank externally, chairs both the General 
Council and 
the Executive 
Council with 
a casting vote, and acts as 
Chief Executive Officer in the management 
of the Bank. The Deputy Governor 
is appointed by the Government on a proposal of the 
Minister of Economy and Finance for 
a renewable four-year term. 
The Deputy Governor 
substitutes for the Governor 
in the case of vacancy, absence or illness, and 
may exercise all powers delegated 
to him by the Governor. 
The members of the 
General Council are: 
the Governor; the Deputy Governor; 
six members appointed 
by the Government; 
two ex-officio members who are the Director- General of the Budget and the Director-General 
of the Treasury 
and Financial Policy; the 
Director-Generals of the Bank (up to four); and a representative of the staff of the Bank. 
The six members of the General Council 
are appointed by the Government 
for a 
renewable Annex I1 three-year term; 
the Director-Generals of the Bank are appointed 
by the Minister of Economy 
and Finance 
on a proposal of the Executive 
Council of 
the Bank for an unspecified term. The General Council takes 
the decisions and adopts the guidelines necessary 
to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted 
to the Bank. 
It also acts as advisor to the Government and 
approves the Bank's reports and regulations, submitting the former 
to the Government. 
The Executive Council comprises the Governor, the Deputy 
Governor, three members elected by 
the General Council from the 
six members appointed by 
the Government, and 
one Director-General of the Bank. 
The Executive Council 
implements the 
policy guidelines issued by the General Council. 
It drafts and proposes 
the Bank's reports which are submitted for approval 
to the General Council, and decides upon 
any authorisation required under banking and financial legislation as 
well as on the sanctions envisaged under 
this legislation. 
There is no provision in Spanish legislation for the issuance 
of instructions by the Government to the governing bodies 
of the Bank. Moreover, according 
to the Bank's Law, 
"the Banco de Espaiia shall act 
with independence of the Government, within 
the limits established under this Law". 
These limits, however, 
do not consist 
of precise instructions, 
but refer rather to the general division 
of responsibilities for monetary policy 
as indicated below. 
5.3. Independence in the formulation and implementation 
of monetary and 
exchange rate policy The current Banco de 
Espaiia Law 
states that 
"the Bank shall conduct monetary 
policy both domestically and externally 
in accordance with the general objectives set by 
the Government, implementing 
it as it deems most appropriate 
for attaining the stated ends". 
Accordingly, the general objectives 
of monetary policy 
are formulated by the Government, while the implementation, both domestically 
and externally, is the responsibility of 
the Banco de Espaiia. In that capacity, 
the Bank may exercise freedom 
of choice in 
the instruments it wishes to employ. In practice, the general objectives 
of domestic monetary policy 
are set 
in terms 
of annual targets 
for monetary aggregates 
which are established by 
the Bank and 
adopted by the Government. Exchange rate policy 
is conducted in the framework of 
the EMS. Thus, 
central rates are set 
by the Government in close consultation 
with the Bank; thereafter, exchange rate 
policy is determined by 
the Bank. In this regard, 
it must be noted that 
the Bank has 
full freedom with regard 
to interventions in the foreign exchange market. 
5.4. Democratic accountability and transparency 
The Parliament is entitled to call on the Governor 
to report on monetary policy and other areas related to 
the tasks and functions 
of the Bank. In addition, 
the Bank 
publishes an Annual Report and monthly Economic Bulletins 
which examine economic and financial 
developments and explain monetary policy. 
The Bank publishes 
Annual Accounts. 
The management and operations of the 
Bank are audited by the Spanish Court 
of Auditors. 5.5. Prospective institutional 
changes The Government has recently approved a Draft 
Law on the Autonomy of the 
Bank which 
has been submitted to Parliament for enactment. This Draft Law introduces all the provisions of the Treaty 
of European Union relating to central banks 
and will 
come into 
force on 1st January 
1994. The tasks and functions of the Bank are modified 
to encompass both the definition 
and implementation of monetary policy. 
The main objective assigned to 
monetary policy 
is price stability. "Monetary financing" 
of the public sector 
is prohibited. The term of office of the Governor 
and the Deputy Governor is set at six years, non-renewable. 
6. BANQUE DE FRANCE 6.1. Objectives and 
tasks The Bank has the objectives 
of overseeing money and 
credit; in this 
connection it 
oversees that the banking system functions smoothly. 
The main tasks 
are: to 
issue bank notes; to participate in 
the preparation and 
implementation of monetary policy; 
to implement foreign exchange policy and to 
manage official reserves; 
to hold the Treasury bank 
account; to 
participate in the management of the 
payment system; 
to participate in banking 
and financial regulation and 
to supervise credit 
institutions on behalf 
of the Banking 
Commission. 6.2. Governing bodies The governing bodies 
of the Bank 
are: the Governor, the two Deputy Governors 
and the General Council. 
The Governor and Deputy Governors are appointed by the Government without a 
fixed term of office. 
The Governor manages 
and administers the Bank 
and exercises all the powers not vested in the General Council, 
which he chairs. 
The General Council 
includes the Governor and Deputy Governors and the 
Councillors. Nine 
of the Councillors are 
appointed by the Government 
on a proposal 
from the Minister of Economic Affairs 
and Finance while one Councillor 
is elected by the 
personnel of 
the Bank. 
All the Councillors are appointed for 
six years. The Council deals with operational, 
administrative and financial matters. 
A Censor appointed 
by the Minister 
of Economic Affairs and Finance attends 
meetings of the General 
Council and 
may raise objections 
to decisions of the Council. 
If he does object, 
the Governor asks the 
General Council to 
reconsider the matter. 
Annex I1 6.3. Independence in the formulation and 
implementation of monetary 
and exchange rate 
policy The Bank contributes 
to the definition 
of the monetary policy adopted by the 
Government. The implementation of monetary policy 
is the subject 
of joint decisions by the 
Minister of Economic Affairs 
and Finance and the Governor. 
This covers both 
the choice of 
instruments and the changes affecting 
them. Government deficits are not 
financed by the central bank. Since the agreement 
on the operation of the Foreign Exchange 
Stabilisation Fund in 1973, central bank assistance 
to the Government only involves neutralising the impact 
on the Treasury's liquidity position 
of the Fund's operating results. There 
is therefore no 
central bank financing of 
the public authorities through this channel. Moreover, 
the Bank does not 
purchase securities, either 
government or private sector, 
in the primary market. Operations in the foreign 
exchange market are conducted by the 
Bank in close consultation with the Minister of 
Economic Affairs and Finance, who may 
give the 
Bank general directions in this area. 
6.4. Democratic accountability 
and transparency The Governor takes 
an oath before the President 
of the Republic that 
he will duly and faithfully manage the 
Bank in coqformity with the laws 
and regulations. He also presents the report 
on the Bank's operations 
to the President of the Republic in the 
name of the 
General Council 
as often as he 
deems it necessary, and at least once 
a year. Reports are 
regularly published describing monetary 
and economic developments and the policy actions 
of the Bank. 
6.5. Prospective institutional 
changes The statutes of the 
Bank will 
have to be amended in order to be brought into 
line with the provisions 
of the Maastricht Treaty. The Government has, in 
a number of recent 
statements, confirmed its commitment 
to implement 
such a reform but 
has not 
to date 
officially presented any draft amendments. 
A parliamentary group recently announced the 
tabling of a bill to make the 
Bank independent. 7. CENTRAL BANK OF IRELAND 7.1. Objectives and tasks 
The statutory objective 
is to safeguard the 
integrity of the currency. 
The main tasks include: 
issuing currency; 
formulating and implementing 
monetary policy; managing official reserves; 
overseeing financial 
markets; and acting 
as fiscal agent 
of the Government 
and as registrar 
of government securities. 
The Bank is also responsible for banking 
and financial regulation. 
Annex I1 7.2. Governing bodies The Bank is governed by the Board of Directors which consists of the Governor 
and up to nine Directors. 
The Governor is appointed by the President 
of the Republic 
on the advice of the Government for a renewable 
term of seven years. 
Other members of the Board 
are appointed by the Minister 
of Finance for a period 
of five years. 
7.3. Independence in the formulation and 
implementation of monetary 
and exchange rate 
policy The Bank is responsible for the formulation and implementation of monetary 
policy. Decisions 
on monetary policy are taken in the context 
of the exchange 
rate policy set 
by the Government but without ongoing reference 
to the Finance Ministry. 
The Government's input to monetary policy 
is via the Secretary 
of the Department 
of Finance in 
his capacity as a member of the Board 
of the Central Bank. The 
Minister can 
require the Governor 
(andfor the Board) to consult with him in regard to the execution and 
performance by the Bank of its 
general function 
and duty. This power has never 
been used. The Bank exercises full freedom in its choice 
and use of instruments. 
There are no obligations on the 
Bank to 
finance the 
Government or 
public sector and, in practice, 
such financing has been extremely limited. 
While the determination 
of exchange rate policy 
is ultimately a matter 
for Government, the Minister 
of Finance is statutorily obliged 
to consult with 
the Bank on matters relating 
to exchange rate policy. 
7.4. Democratic accountability and transparency 
The Bank is required to prepare an Annual Report and send it to 
the Minister of 
Finance, who 
has the duty to 
present it 
to both Houses 
of Parliament. Similarly, a Statement 
of the Bank's annual financial accounts 
is provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General; 
he, in turn, after audit 
and certification, sends it 
to the Minister, 
who circulates it to the Members of Parliament. 
7.5. Prospective institutional 
changes A bill incorporating changes in the 
Bank legislation to make it consistent with the 
Treaty on European Union is intended to be sent to Parliament before the end of 
this year. Proposed changes include provisions for modifying the current right 
of the Minister of 
Finance to request that the Governor consults him; clarifying the 
role of the Bank in regard to 
payment systems; permitting the disclosure 
of information to the ECB; and 
enabling the Bank to comply with Treaty requirements relating 
to the collection 
of statistics and 
the application of special deposits and reserve ratios 
on behalf of the ECB. 
Annex I1 8. BANCA D'ITALIA 
8.1. Objectives and 
tasks Although no statutory objective 
is set, the Italian Constitution states that the 
Republic has a duty to protect savings, 
which implies that the 
Bank should pursue 
the goal of 
monetary stability. 
Main tasks are: issue 
of bank notes; 
implementation of monetary policy; 
supervision of banks 
and other financial institutions; fiscal agent of the Government; and 
management of official reserves jointly 
with the Italian Foreign Exchange Office. 
8.2. Governing bodies 
The governing bodies 
are: the Governor, the Director General and two Deputy 
Director-Generals, forming the 
Directorate; and 
the Board of Directors. 
The Directorate is not 
a collegiate body, since the Governor 
has a pre-eminent position. The members are appointed for life 
by the Board of Directors on the approval of the Government; a dismissal should follow the 
same procedure. The Directorate has the responsibility for carrying out the 
tasks of the Banca d'Italia and it is not 
subject to instructions from political authorities 
in the monetary field. 
The Board of Directors 
is composed of the Governor, acting 
as Chairman, and 
thirteen members appointed 
by the local General Assembly 
of Shareholders 
for a 
three-year term. None 
of the members 
can hold a political office. 
The Board is in charge of the 
administration of the Bank but 
is not empowered to deal with monetary or exchange rate policy nor 
with matters relating 
to banking supervision. 
8.3. Independence 
in the formulation 
and implementation of monetary and 
exchange rate 
policy Annual monetary policy objectives are 
set by the Governor and 
are formally approved by 
the Government. In no 
case have the objectives presented by the Governor 
been rejected. The Bank has fiill freedom in setting instruments 
for the implementation of 
monetary policy. 
An important step in this direction was 
the acquisition of the 
right to set the 
discount rate autonomously, which was granted in February 1992. 
The main credit facility 
to the Treasury is 
an unconditional overdraft 
on a direct credit line, up to the limit of 14% of 
total expenditures planned in the Budget 
Law. Above this limit, in case of financing needs that conflict 
with monetary policy targets, 
the Treasury may only obtain 
an "extraordinary advance" following an authorisation by the Parliament 
with a specific law (this 
has happened only once in January 1983). 
The Bank operates 
within the exchange rate regime 
set by the Government, but 
has full discretion regarding the conduct 
of foreign exchange market operations. 
Annex I1 8.4. Democratic accountability 
and transparency The Treasury has supervisory powers over the issue of bank notes, the 
administration and the accounting 
of the Banca 
d'Italia. A representative of the Treasury 
attends the meetings of the Board 
and the Board conclusions take effect if the Treasury does 
not oppose them 
within five days. 
The Governor may 
be invited to appear before 
Parliamentary Commissions 
and to 
give an account of the conduct of monetary policy. 
An Annual Report and other documents are published. 
8.5. Prospective institutional changes 
In 1993, the Government submitted 
to Parliament a bill 
to reform the overdraft 
facility which provides for: abolition 
of any form 
of advances to the Treasury; conversion of 
the existing debt 
on the overdraft facility into government securities with a specified term to 
maturity; and creation 
of an interest bearing account 
at the Bank 
which must have 
a permanent positive balance. The same 
bill transfers to the Banca 
d'Italia the power to modify 
the compulsory reserve ratio. In addition, a first reform of the required reserve regime 
has been decided, 
which reduces the required reserve ratio. Finally, other institutional changes 
required to fulfil the criteria 
of the Maastricht Treaty are under joint examination 
by the Banca dlItalia and the Treasury. 
9. INSTITUT MONETAIRE LUXEMBOURGEOIS 9.1. Objectives and tasks 
Luxembourg is linked to Belgium 
in an 
economic union comprising a monetary 
association, dating back 
to 1922. The Institut MonCtaire Luxembourgeois (IML), created in 1983, does not exercise 
at this stage 
all the attributions 
of a fully-fledged central bank, 
as the National Bank of Belgium currently fulfils a series of tasks 
for both Member States of the 
association. The tasks of the 
IML are: to 
issue notes 
and coins; to promote the stability of the 
currency and to that effect 
to oversee the proper 
functioning of financial markets; to execute 
obligations and to exercise rights resulting from international agreements in the monetary and 
financial field; and 
to exercise the prudential 
supervision of the financial sector. 
9.2. Governing bodies 
The governing bodies 
of the IML are the Management and 
the Council. The Management is a collegiate body, comprising the Director General 
and two 
Directors. They are appointed 
by the Grand-Duke on a proposal 
from the Council of 
Ministers for a renewable 
six-year term. The Management is the executive organ of the IML, 
responsible for the fulfilment of the IML's objectives. 
If there is a fundamental disagreement 
between the Government and the Management on the IML's policy and the execution of 
its Annex I1 tasks, the Government 
with the consent of the Council of the IML may propose to the Grand- 
Duke the 
collective, and only 
the collective, 
dismissal of the Management. Without prejudice 
to this provision, members 
of the Management are 
not subject 
to instructions from political 
authorities. The Council has 
seven members appointed by the Council 
of Ministers for a 
renewable four-year term. 
The Council provides 
guidelines and gives opinions 
on specified activities of the IML, approves the 
annual accounts and 
the yearly budget 
of the IML but 
has no competence in the field 
of prudential supervision. 
The members of the Council are not 
subject to instructions from political authorities. 
9.3. Independence in the formulation and implementation of 
monetary and exchange rate policy 
The "last word" in 
monetary and exchange 
rate policy decisions belongs to the 
Government and 
the IML avails itself 
only of a limited number 
of monetary policy 
instruments. Although the 
IML has the 
authority to 
regulate the use of banks' 
franc- denominated liabilities, it 
has never used this 
facility. 9.4. Democratic accountability and transparency 
The Management of the IML has statutory obligations to submit an annual report, 
financial accounts and a budget for the 
approval of the Government. 
These documents are 
forwarded to Parliament. 
The Government-appointed auditor of the IML also draws up 
an annual report which 
is transmitted to the council of the IML, 
the Government and Parliament. 
In addition, the Director 
General of the IML traditionally meets for a twice-yearly exchange 
of views with the Parliamentary Committee 
for Budgetary and Financial Matters. 
9.5. Prospective institutional changes 
The passage to the final stage 
of EMU will entail 
substantial amendments to the 
monetary association 
with Belgium, with the IML taking over the full functions 
of the central 
bank of Luxembourg. A draft 
bill to that effect 
is in preparation at the 
IML. 10. DE NEDERLANDSCHE BANK 10.1. Objectives 
and tasks The statutory objective 
of the Bank is to safeguard the value of the currency. 
Thus price stability 
is clearly a policy objective. 
The Bank's main tasks include: 
to issue bank notes; to facilitate domestic and 
external money transfers; 
to manage official reserves; and to 
supervise banks and other 
financial institutions. 
Annex I1 10.2. Governing bodies 
The Governing Board and the Supervisory Board 
are the governing bodies of the 
Bank and the Bank 
Council is an advisory body. 
The Governing Board consists 
of the President, the Secretary, 
as well as not less 
than three (the present number) 
and not more 
than five Executive Directors. 
They are nominated by a joint meeting 
of the Governing 
Board and 
the Supervisory Board, and 
appointed by the 
Crown on a proposal by the Cabinet 
for a renewable seven-year term. 
All policy decisions of the 
Bank are made 
by the Governing Board, 
which is also fully 
responsible for the management 
of the Bank. Except in cases of a major policy conflict 
between the Bank and 
the Government, the Governing 
Board is not subject 
to instructions from the Government regarding the conduct 
of monetary policy. 
The Supervisory Board consists of twelve members, appointed by the Minister 
of Finance for a 
renewable term of four years. It 
supervises the Bank's business affairs and 
adopts the annual balance 
sheet and profit and loss account. 
A Royal Commissioner 
supervises the affairs of the 
Bank on behalf of the Government. The Bank Council consists of sixteen members and the Royal Commissioner. Its 
role is to offer advice 
to the Bank and 
the Minister 
of Finance on matters of the Bank's policy. 
Four members are appointed by 
and from the 
members of the Supervisory Board. 
The other twelve are appointed 
by the Crown, 
and include financial experts and representatives of 
industry and labour. 
10.3. Independence 
in the formulation and implementation of 
monetary and exchange rate policy 
The Bank has full freedom regarding the formulation and implementation 
of domestic monetary policy. 
As the Minister of Finance is responsible to Parliament for the conduct of monetary policy, regular 
consultation between 
the Bank and 
the Minister 
is required. In the event of 
a major conflict, the Minister 
of Finance has the authority 
to give such directions to the Governing 
Board as he 
thinks necessary for the Bank's policy 
to be properly co-ordinated 
with the Government's monetary and financial policies. 
The Governing Board, however, 
can state its objections 
to these 
directions and appeal 
to the Crown. 
The Crown's decision 
can only be taken by 
the Council of Ministers meeting 
in plenary session. 
If it is decided that the Governing 
Board has 
to comply with 
the directions, the reasoned 
decision of the Crown, as 
well as the Bank's objections, 
would be published 
in the official 
gazette; in 
such an event, a dispute would most 
likely cause 
a major political crisis. However, 
until now the Minister of Finance has never 
exercised his statutory right to give directions; 
this was intended by the legislator, 
and has continued to 
be considered by policy makers, as 
only an ultimate remedy. 
In practice, therefore, the 
Bank has a high degree of independence 
Annex I1 and has complete freedom 
to enact 
measures of monetary control 
such as cash reserves, providing the banking 
system has 
been consulted. The Bank has an obligation to grant secured and 
interest-free credit 
to the Treasury, on request of the Minister 
of Finance, to a maximum of only F]. 150 million. 
A further, limited and collateralised 
credit facility is agreed yearly 
on which the Minister 
of Finance can draw 
to bridge temporary 
cash needs. Participation in exchange rate arrangements 
as well as the acceptance of changes 
in central rates 
is determined by the Government, after 
consultation with 
the Bank. Within the 
constraints posed 
by the EMS arrangement, the 
Bank has full 
freedom in the formulation of 
the strategy with respect to exchange rate 
policy and in 
the use 
of instruments (interest rates, 
intervention, the fluctuation margin). 
10.4. Democratic accountability 
and transparency The Minister of Finance is accountable to Parliament for the conduct of monetary 
policy. As required by the 
Bank Act, 
the Governing 
Board publishes weekly 
a summary balance sheet 
of the Bank. Furthermore, the 
Bank publishes an Annual Report (including the 
annual accounts) 
on its activities. 10.5. Prospective institutional 
changes It is envisaged 
that an explicit clause will 
be added to the Bank Act that 
all operations of the 
Bank by the 
start of Stage Two 
shall be in accordance with Article 104 of 
the Treaty referring 
to the prohibition 
of "monetary financing". Necessary amendments to 
legislation will probably be laid before Parliament before the summer of 1993. In accordance 
with the Treaty, the statutory right 
of the Minister of Finance to give instructions to the Bank 
will be abolished before the 
establishment of the ESCB. Furthermore, the appointment 
procedures, the composition 
and the 
structure of the governing bodies of the 
Bank will 
be reconsidered. Additionally, the 
Government considers it advisable 
to give Parliament the 
opportunity to hear the President 
of the Nederlandsche Bank on 
the activities of 
the ESCB, in a manner comparable 
to provisions in the Treaty. 
11. BANCO DE PORTUGAL 11.1 Objectives and tasks 
The objectives of the 
Bank are the maintenance 
of internal monetary stability and 
the external solvency of the currency. 
The main tasks are: 
to define, jointly 
with the government, 
and to 
implement monetary and exchange-rate policy; 
to hold and manage the official reserves; 
to act as intermediary in the state's international monetary relations; and to 
oversee the stability of the 
Annex I1 national financial system. In the latter respect the 
Bank has responsibility for banking supervision. 11.2 Governing bodies 
The governing bodies 
of the Banco de Portugal are the Governor and the Board of 
Directors. The Governor and the members 
of the Board are appointed 
for five-year renewable 
terms by the Council 
of Ministers on a proposal from the Minister of Finance. 
The members of the Board are not subject 
to instructions; however, there are frequent consultations 
with the Minister of Finance. Furthermore, the law explicitly states that the Bank take into account the 
Government's guidelines. 
In addition, there 
is a 
Board of Auditors and 
an Advisory Board. 
11.3 Independence in the formulation and implementation 
of monetary and 
exchange rate policy The formulation of both monetary 
and exchange rate policy is decided jointly 
with the Government. The Bank has the responsibility 
for the implementation 
of monetary policy and 
has full freedom in setting policy instruments. One important qualification, 
however, concerns the policy measures that, by law, have 
to be published in the form of 
Notices (Avisos) 
of the Banco de Portugal before coming into effect. 
The Avisos have to be signed by the Minister 
of Finance. Within the Exchange 
Rate Mechanism 
the choice of the central 
rate is the responsibility of the Government after consulting the Bank. 
The Bank is responsible for the implementation of exchange rate policy 
and for the management 
of the exchange 
rate within the fluctuation bands. 
There are no provisions for resolving conflicts. 
The most important tasks that 
might conceivably conflict 
with monetary policy are prudential supervision and lender 
of last resort functions. Additionally, the 
central bank 
statutes do not preclude 
the underwriting of 
Treasury bills, under terms agreed 
between the Finance Ministry and the Bank. 
11.4 Democratic accountability and transparency 
The Board of Auditors and the Advisory Board 
perform important functions to 
ensure transparency. Furthermore 
the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements 
have to be approved by the Minister of Finance taking into account the advice of the Board of Auditors. 
In addition, the Governor 
is invited to 
appear before the relevant Committees of Parliament. 
11.5 Prospective institutional changes 
The only immediate change envisaged 
in the central bank statute 
is an amendment to prohibit the underwriting 
of Treasury bills. Independence 
will be further reinforced within 
the prescribed schedule in the Treaty 
in line with the recent revision of the Portuguese 
Constitution. Annex I1 12. BANK OF ENGLAND 12.1. Objectives and tasks 
Although there are no explicit statutory objectives in the 
monetary policy field, 
the 1987 
Banking Act gives 
the Bank, in its role as banking supervisor, 
the objective of 
protecting the interests of depositors. 
In practice, the main objectives are: to maintain the 
integrity and value of 
the currency; to safeguard the integrity of 
the financial system, 
including payment and settlement arrangements; and 
to promote the efficiency and 
effectiveness of 
the financial sector. 
When the appointment of the next Governor, Mr. E.A.J. George, 
was announced on 22nd January 1993, 
the Chancellor said 
that the new Governor's central responsibility 
should be "to support 
the Government in its determination to bring a lasting reduction in the 
rate of inflation, 
the only sound basis 
on which sustainable growth and secure 
jobs can be built" . The main tasks of the 
Bank are: the 
implementation of monetary policy, 
the issue of currency, management of official reserves 
and supervision of banks. 12.2. Governing bodies 
The governing body 
is the Court 
of Directors. It consists of the Governor, the 
Deputy Governor and sixteen Directors, 
up to four of whom may 
have executive responsibilities in the Bank. Governors 
and Directors are appointed by 
the Crown on the advice of the Prime 
Minister. The Governor and 
Deputy Governor 
are appointed for 
renewable five-year terms, and Directors 
for renewable four-year terms. 
The Court is responsible for the affairs of the Bank. 
Members of 
the Court are not individually subject 
to instructions from political authorities. However, 
the Treasury has the 
legal power to issue "directions" 
to the Bank "in the public 
interest" after consultations 
with the Governor, though this power 
has never formally been invoked. 
12.3. Independence 
in the formulation 
and implementation of monetary 
and exchange rate policy The Bank's responsibility 
is to advise on monetary policy and 
to carry out the 
policy that 
has been agreed with the Government. 
Final decisions on monetary policy matters 
are for the Government. When a conflict arises between 
the views of the Bank and 
the Government, the Government's opinion 
will ultimately prevail. It 
is open to 
the Bank 
to make its views public. 
The main instrument 
of monetary policy is the short-term interest rate, which 
the Bank influences through 
its operations in the money markets. 
The Bank has considerable Annex I1 discretion in the conduct 
of these operations, 
although the interest 
rate objective is determined by the Government. 
The Bank acts as 
fiscal agent for 
the Government 
and at times provides short-term 
finance in 
the form of "Ways and Means Advances" 
although at others the Government 
has a 
deposit at the Bank. Neither 
of these activities, 
nor the Bank's role as supervisor of banks and 
certain market participants, conflict 
in any way with its monetary policy functions. 
Foreign exchange market activities are 
conducted by the 
Bank as agent for the Government, which owns the foreign exchange reserves. 
As agent, the Bank operates within 
guidelines set by the Treasury. 
12.4. Democratic accountability and transparency 
The Bank makes an Annual Report to Parliament presenting the accounts, and 
a further Annual Report describing its 
conduct of supervision. In addition, the 
Bank regularly publishes reports commenting 
on economic and financial developments, and the Governor 
appears frequently before Committees 
of Parliament. Formally, however, 
the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer or another Treasury 
Minister answers for the 
Bank in Parliament. The Chancellor recently announced new measures 
to increase the transparency of the monetary policy process. These include the announcement of 
a Government target 
for inflation; publication 
of monetary reports 
on data relevant 
to monetary policy 
by the Treasury; and publication 
of a quarterly report from the 
Bank on the progress being 
made in achieving the Government's inflation target. 
12.5. Prospective institutional changes 
There are no plans for institutional 
changes other than the moves described above 
towards greater openness 
of monetary policy. 
If the United Kingdom were 
to participate in 
Stage Three 
of EMU, institutional change 
would be required. ABBREVIATIONS AND SYMBOLS CURRENCIES ECU BEF DKK DEM GRD ESP FRF IEP ITL NLG PTE GBP USD
