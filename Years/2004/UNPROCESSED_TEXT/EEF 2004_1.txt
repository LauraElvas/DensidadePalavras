xOverviewOverviewThe recovery surpasses  
expectations in Europe 
 Following the turn
around in the second half 
of 2003, economic 
activity in the 
euro area and the EU gathered speed this year. Supported by the continued 
buoyancy of global growth and trade, th
e growth rates are projected to reach 
2.1% in the euro area and 2.5% in the EU this year. This is followed by a 
deceleration of the order of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points in both regions in 
2005, as the sharp rise in oil prices take
s its toll, and a subs
equent rebound in 
2006 as the latter effect tapers off. 
Apart from the external impulse fr
om global demand, the main factors 
behind the outlook include accommodative macroeconomic policies, low 
inflation, supportive financial conditio
ns, widening profit margins, and 
progress in structural reforms.  
The consolidation of the recovery over the forecast horizon is underpinned 
by an acceleration of investment expenditure and a more gradual pick-up in 
private consumption. As the lagged effects of the protracted downturn 
dissipate, the performance of the labour market is expected to respond to the 

momentum of economic activity. Employ
ment growth in the euro area, at 
0.5% in 2004, is expected to accelerate to 0.9% in 2005 and 2006. For the 
EU as a whole, the pick-up profile is similar, although the rise in 

employment is projected to be slightly lower.  
Global trade thrives, as 
world economic activity 
accelerates The vigorous rebound in world trade in
 2003 is set to be outperformed by a 
sharp rise to almost 10% in 2004. Th
e near-term outlook is for a moderation 
to around 8% in 2005 and somewhat lo
wer in 2006, as the world growth 
cycle matures. 
The pace of world GDP growth regist
ered 3.5% in 2003. This year, world 
economic activity should expand at 5%, the fastest pace since the seventies, 

before easing back to a robust 4.
2% in 2005 and 20
06. The surge in 
economic activity is driven by a num
ber of factors, including supportive 
macroeconomic policies, historically low real interest rates, housing-market-
induced wealth effects, and particularly strong growth in certain emerging 
economies, such as China. 
1Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2004 - 2 -
The regional distribution of world grow
th has continued to widen in 2004, 
with stronger-than-expected contribu
tions coming from the EU, Japan, the 
CIS, OPEC, Asia (especially China) and Latin America. In the US, helped by 
monetary and fiscal policy stimuli and 
solid underlying 
productivity growth, 
economic activity is expected to realise growth of 4.4% in 2004. 

Nonetheless, in view of the high and rising current account deficit and the 
large general government deficit, this pace of economic expansion is viewed 
as unsustainable, and accordingly the grow
th rate is expected to fall slightly 
below trend at 3% in 2005 and 2.9% in 2006. 
After the marked improvement experienced by Japan this year, the growth 
rate is expected to move back towards po
tential, at 2.1% in 2005. Deflation is 
still present in the economy but appear
s to be diminishing, as prices have 
started to rise in certain sectors. The 
general government deficit is expected 
to edge to 7% of GDP and lower in
 2005 and 2006. The economic outlook 
for Asia (excluding Japan) remains vibrant
, with growth in the vicinity of 7% 
in 2005-6. During this period, some attenuation of China™s vivid performance 
is expected, while India™s growth ra
te continues to climb. Among the other 
emerging regions, economic activity in Latin America is expected to ease off 

in 2005-6, while growth sh
ould build up moment
um in Africa. In the 
candidate countries, the strong performance in 2004 is expected to be 
followed by lower, but still robus
t growth in 2005 and 2006.   
Rising commodity prices and flat stock 

markets 
 The global recovery has put upward pressure on both fuel and non-fuel 
commodity prices. In view of the sharp ri
se in oil prices since the first quarter 
of this year, the assumed profile for 
oil prices has been revised upwards 
compared to the Spring forecasts. From an average of USD 40.6 per barrel 
(Brent crude) in the third quarter of this
 year, the price of oil is assumed to 
rise to USD 50 in the fourth quarter, 
before declining gradually to USD 42.5 
in the last quarter of next year, yielding an average of USD 45.1 per barrel 
for 2005. Some easing is foreseen during
 the course of 20
06, leading to an 
average of USD 40.1 per barrel. After a projected rise of 38% this year, this 
profile implies a further increase of 15
% next year, followed by a decline of 
11% in 2006.  Although the oil price hike is less in r
eal terms than during previous shocks 
and most industrialised oil-importin
g economies have reduced their 
dependence on oil, this year™s sharp ri
se has already dented world growth for 
2004. The persistence of higher oil prices
 and their increased volatility have 
adverse implications for the growth outlook over the forecast horizon. 
Global equity prices have levelled of
f during the course of this year. 
Although long-term government bond yiel
ds have risen modestly with the 
measured tightening of monetary policy in some countries, they are still low 
by historical standards in both nom
inal and real terms. Corporate bond 
spreads have also remained narrow. Ov
erall, these develop
ments suggest that 
financing conditions in the global economy continue to be supportive of 
world economic activity.   
2OverviewGrowth gathered momentum in the euro-

area and EU economies 
in the first half of 2004 
– Following the turna
round during the second half of 2003, the recovery in 
both the euro area and the EU picked up speed in the first half of this year.  

The euro-area rebound has been driven by the sustained growth of exports, 
while the growth-contribution of domestic demand has remained relatively 
weak. Within the latter, the behaviour 
of investment has been particularly 
disappointing. Gross fixed capital formati
on, which shrank in the first quarter 
and barely increased in th
e second quarter, failed to 
make any contribution to 
growth in the first half of the year. After a relatively healthy performance in 

the first quarter, private consumption 
provided only a slight impulse to 
growth in the second quarter. 
The outcome for the EU reveals a similar picture in terms of the composition 
of growth, although the relative contribution of domestic demand was 
stronger than that of external demand in
 the second quarter. 
In this context, 
the pick-up in gross fixed capital formation 
in the second quarter of this year 
is of particular interest. This is due mainly to an acceleration in investment in 

the UK. The pace of the rebound in the first half of 2004 exceeded predictions in the 
Spring forecast.However,compared to 
previous economic upturns, external 
demand has continued to be the main support of the pick-up for a longer 
period of time, while the revival of internal demand has been slower. 
–and will dip in 2005 
as a result of the sharp 

rise in oil prices 
 Survey indicators have been sending 
out mixed signals this year concerning 
the prospects for the strength and su
stainability of the 
recovery. The overall economic sentiment indicator has extend
ed its slight upward movement this 
year, both for the euro area and the EU. While the composite Purchasing 
Managers Index (PMI) has remained a
pproximately stable, both the PMI in 
manufacturing and the Commission™s industrial confidence indicator have 
maintained an upward trend. In genera
l, although the trends are similar, the 
confidence indicators for the EU tend to exc
eed those for the euro area.    Table 0.1

3Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2004  In the services sector, confidence is still languishing. The trends in the 
confidence indicator for the euro area and the PMI for services have 
remained broadly flat this year. The corresponding confidence indicator for 
the EU has fared better, although it re
mains below the long-term average. 
The consumer and retail confidence indicators also appear to have tapered off 

and retail sales have remained volatile.   
The anticipated recovery in househol
d and business spending in the coming 
months stems in part from the particular
ly low real interest rates, both short-
term and long-term. This has contributed to a relaxation of the balance-sheet 
constraints of households and busi
nesses through a reduction in debt 
servicing costs. Corporate profit margi
ns have also widened. The real 
disposable income of households has been sustained by the resilience of 
employment and real wage growth. The projected decline in inflation and the 
effect on wealth of buoyant housing 
markets in some Member States should 
also provide a positive impe
tus to consumption.  
Summing up, the average growth rates in 2004 are projected at 2.1% for the 
euro area and 2.5% for the EU. The prolongation of higher oil prices is 

expected to dampen growth to 2% in the euro area and 2.3% in the EU in 
2005. As the price of oil su
bsides, growth is set to pick up once again in 
2006. Compared to the Spring forecast, this represents an upward adjustment 

in both regions for this year and a re
duction for next year. Growth over the 
next two years is expected to be su
pported by domestic demand, which in 
turn will be sustained by an acceleration of capital formation during the 

course of 2005, followed by a more gr
adual pick-up in 
private consumption 
expenditure.

4OverviewEncouraging labour 
market outlook 
 The tempered labour market response in the prolonged downturn has been 
followed by a slow response in the uptu
rn. The rise in the unemployment rate 
was quite subdued in comparison to previous cycles. The euro area 
unemployment rate stabilised at 9% in
 the second quar
ter of 2004, after 
increasing by 1 percentage point during
 the slowdown in the current cycle. 
This contrasts with a rise of over 2 pe
rcentage points to above 10% in the 
trough of the early nineties. On the empl
oyment side, the picture is also more 
encouraging insofar as job losses are concerned. No jobs were lost in net 

terms in the recent downt
urn, while more than 2.5 m
illion jobs disappeared 
in the 1992-93
 recession.  
In line with the usual lag
ged response of the labou
r market, about half a 
million jobs are expected to be created this year in the euro area and 0.8 
million in the EU. However, these figures 
should almost double in 2005 as 
the recovery consolidates. The unemplo
yment rate is expected to remain 
stable at 8.9% in the euro area and 9.1% 
in the EU this year and next, before 
edging downwards in 2006.  
Headline inflation set to 
fall below 2% in the 
euro area in 2005, while 
remaining slightly 
higher in the EU 
 Headline inflation in the euro area remained sticky in 2004, buoyed up by 
such factors as energy price hikes and rises in indirect taxes. Compared to a 
projected 2.1% in 2004, headline inflatio
n is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2005, 
as a result of weak domestic price pressur
es. Inflation should fall further to 
1.7% in 2006. 
Core inflation has also been rather stic
ky in the euro area this year. It has 
moved upwards since the beginning of
 the year, from 1.9% in January to 
2.1% in September. The rise in underly
ing inflation is the result of higher 
processed food inflation in early 2004. 
This stems from increases in indirect 
taxes on tobacco in several Member States, combined with accelerating 
inflation in services, which is pa
rtly due to upward pressure from 
administered prices. 
For the EU as a whole, a similar profile is expected over the forecast period 
for headline inflation, starting from 
2.2% in 2004. The projected rate of 
decline is slightly lower. The gener
ally higher inflation rates anticipated for 
the recently-acceded Member States means that inflation dispersion is greater 

in the EU than in
 the euro area.   Modest consolidation in 
euro-area deficits 
despite recovery 
 Following a moderate but
 non-negligible easing of fi
scal policies since 2000, 
the recovery under way in the euro area since mid-2003 is foreseen to 
coincide with a modest discretionary ti
ghtening. As a result, based on current 
policies, the general government deficit is set to improve over the forecast 

period, from 2.9% of GDP in 2004 to
 2.5% in 2005 and, under unchanged 
policies, would remain unchanged in
 2006, while the cyclically-adjusted 
deficit is projected to improve by a s
lightly smaller amount. Deficits around 
or in excess of the 3% of GDP threshold are expected in Germany, Greece, 
France, Italy and Portugal, unless additional consolidation measures are 
adopted. Debt ratios in these countries are in excess of the 60% of GDP 

threshold and would either rise 
or fail to decrease significantly. 
5Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2004 Outside the euro area, the United Kin
gdom is set to gradually reduce the 
deficit from the expenditure
-induced peak in 2003 on the back of buoyant 
growth. In most of the recently-acceded Member States with high deficits, 
fiscal consolidation is expected to make headway during the forecast period, 
helped in some cases by a faster-tha
n-expected resumption of growth at or 
above trend rates. 
Upside and downside 
risks to the forecast 
 The broad-based simultaneous acceleration of growth across the world since 
the second half of last year has gene
rated a mutually reinforcing growth 
momentum. Although this momentum is
 strong, it is not without its risks. 
The US, which has retained the role 
of the major driver of growth, is 
characterised by long-standing macroeconomic imbalances that may act as a 
brake on growth later in the forecast period. High and volatile oil prices and 
other commodity prices might also pu
t a damper on global growth.  
A renewed sharp appreciation in the euro exchange rate could undermine 
activity mainly in the euro-area manuf
acturing sector. This is especially 
relevant in view of the fact that the recovery in the euro area (apart from 
France) has continued to rely heavily on external demand as a driving force. 

On the other hand, any further appreci
ation would alleviate inflationary 
pressures and, accordingly, raise real disposable income.  
The protracted nature of the downturn and uncer
tainties related to current and 
future income have undermined consumer confidence, leading to the 
postponement of consumption plans a
nd sluggish private consumption. 
Survey indicators suggest that cons
umers are still wary about committing 
themselves to purchases of larger co
nsumer durable goods. Furthermore, 
recurrent geopolitical tensions continue to
 weigh on consum
er and investor 
confidence. Structural reforms may also have negative effects on confidence 
in the short-term. Although investment
 is being supported by favourable 
financing conditions and positive dev
elopments in earnings and profitability, 
the hesitant nature of the recovery in consumer demand may be holding back 
investment plans. 
The above downside risks are, to some 
extent, offset by a 
few upside risks. 
With the resumption of confidence, the release of pent-up consumer demand 

would consolidate the return to poten
tial growth. This could be financed 
through a reduction in the savings rate. 
The rise in house prices in a number 
of EU countries and the contribution of
 the rise in stock markets to the 
replenishment of household wealth sh
ould also support spending. Labour 
market reforms undertaken by Member States also represent an upside risk. 
Such reforms include the recent changes in Germany, which should begin to 

produce positive results ove
r the forecast horizon, as 
well as the past reforms 
in other Member States, which have 
led to greater labour market resilience 
and a decline in the non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment 

(NAIRU). 
Overall, however, the balance of risks for the coming two years has shifted 
towards the downside in recent months. 
6OverviewCandidate 
Countries The candidate countries are expected 
to continue to enjoy relatively strong 
growth.  In Romania and Turkey, with 
particularly buoyant growth in the 
current year, some deceleration is foreseen over the forecast horizon, 
whereas growth in Croatia and in Bulgaria, at least in 2005, should accelerate 

further. Rising labour productivity and 
an expanding and modernised capital 
stock provide a basis for this continued 
expansion in the candidate countries. 
It is anticipated that priv
ate consumption and investment, in particular, will 
constitute the main demand 
forces supporting sustaine
d growth over the next 
two years.  In all candidate countr
ies, except Croatia, disinflation should continue. 
Croatia is likely to see a slight reacceleration of inflation from currently quite 
low levels. This positive 
outlook for the candidate c
ountries is underpinned 
by a strengthening supply side, driv
en by high investment, and overall 
prudent fiscal and monetary policies, together with some real appreciation of 

the currencies in some countries. Turkey and Romania, especially, are set to 
take a further step towards price stabilit
y, as their inflation rates are expected 
to fall to around 7% in 2006.  
Despite sustained gains in
 labour productivit
y, economic growth is expected 
to lead to a rise in employment in
 all countries except Romania, where 
restructuring in industry an
d agriculture is still in prog
ress on a larger scale. 
In Romania and even more so in Bulg
aria, general government deficits are 
projected to remain quite moderate, 
also supported by strongly rising 
revenues, against the backdrop of su
stained economic growth in these 
countries. In Croatia and pa
rticularly in Turkey, where deficits are presently 
at higher levels, government deficits 
are expected to narrow further.  
In all candidate countries, strong domestic demand and higher world 
commodity prices should lead to risi
ng merchandise trade deficits, which 
would only be partially offs
et by rising surpluses in 
other parts of the current 
account balance. As a result, current account deficits are likely to remain 
fairly high. 7Chapter 1 The world economy- 11 - 
1. Global growth matures The global recovery has matured in 2004, amid 
uncertainties about the impact 
of higher oil prices and 
the extent of the slowing of the growth momentum. 

Despite the tightening of very accommodative 
monetary policies in some countries, real interest rates 
remain very low, and financial conditions remain 

supportive of world grow
th. Looking ahead, world 
growth should continue to be
 robust, although risks to 
the outlook have increased 
due to uncertai
nties about 
the potential impact of higher
 oil prices on the world 
economy, worsening external and internal imbalances 
in the United States, and the risk of a sharp slowdown 

in China. 
World growth moderating but remaining robust 
After peaking in early 2004, global growth is expected 
to slow down moderately, while remaining nevertheless 

above 4% during the forecast period. Apart from the 

fact that above-trend growth is unlikely to be sustained 

for long, several indicators point to a moderation of 

growth in the global economy. World growth slowed in 

the second quarter of this year, notably in the US, Japan 

and China, all of which had experienced very brisk 

growth in the second half of
 2003 and the first quarter 
of this year. -2-101

th in world trade was also 
dynamic: world trade as measured by the CPB-

Netherlands world trade indicator grew by more than 

10% during the same period. However, there are signs 

that global trade growth is moderating along with GDP 

growth, since the rate of change in the world trade 

indicator decelerated in July
. Developments in the 
OECD leading indicator also point to a slowdown of 
global growth. 
Despite the moderation in growth, world economic 
activity is expected to remain 
robust. This trend is also 
evident in world imports of goods, which are projected 

to grow by almost 10% in 2004, the highest rate since 

2000, before decelerating slightly to 8.1% and 7.7%, 

respectively, in 2005 and 2006.

Oil prices have continued to rise 
Since the publication of 
the Commission Spring 
forecast, oil prices have continued to rise, with Brent 

spot prices increasing to over 50 USD/bl. This 

represents an increase of more than 50% in both US 

dollar and euro terms since the beginning of the year. 

The surge in oil prices has been driven by a 

combination of strong demand and supply concerns. 

Stronger-than-previously-expected growth in the 

demand for oil has absorbed most of the spare 

production capacity (available, unused capacity). The 

International Energy Agency
 (IEA) has, since January 
2004, revised upwards its projection of demand for oil 

in 2004 by 2.8 million barrels per day (mb/d). Of this 

increase, 1.3 mb/d is due to an upward revision of 

demand in 2003 and the remaining 1.5 mb/d to upward 

revisions of expected demand growth in 2004. The IEA 

now estimates that the demand for oil will increase by 

2.7 mb/d in 2004, the highest annual increase in oil 

demand in over 20 years, before easing to 1.5 mb/d in 

2005 in view of higher pri
ces and a moderation of the 
world economic expansion.

Graph 1.3 :
Oil price (Brent crude, $ and • per bl.)
EUR
USD
Source: Datastream
The United States and emergi
ng market countries, in 
particular China, have accounted for the major part of 

the increase in demand and th
is trend is expected to 
continue in 2005. As a consequence of the strong 

demand growth, surplus production capacity in world 

oil is now close to its lowest level in many years with 

oil-producing countries, including OPEC, unable to 

increase capacity in the short-term. Furthermore, stock 

levels in industrial countries remain low by historical 
standards. 
As a result of the tight supply
 conditions, markets have 
become more concerned about potential supply 
disruptions and the uncertain
ty surrounding oil prices 
has increased, adding to the risk premium in oil prices. 

In this context, the situati
on in Iraq, terrorist attacks in 
Saudi Arabia, the Yukos cas
e in Russia an
d instabilities in Nigeria and Venezuela have contributed to the risks 

of a possible shortfall in oil supply, and are likely to 
have significantly affected the risk premium.  
Looking ahead, oil prices are expected to remain high 
throughout the forecast horizon. Consistent with the 

path predicted by futures 
markets prices, the price of 
Brent oil is assumed to decline only very gradually, 
staying above 45 USD/bl. until 
the second half of 2005, 
and moving towards 39 USD/bl. at the end of the 
forecast period. This implies that the average annual oil 
price in 2004 will be 38% higher compared to the price 

in 2003, with a further increas
e of 15% in 
2005, before declining by 11% in 2006. 
Higher oil prices have dented world growth
The increase in oil prices has already had an impact on 
the economic outlook, as higher oil prices transfer funds 
from oil importers to o
il exporters and constitute a 
negative supply shock by increasing the cost of 

production of goods and services. Furthermore, if oil 

price increases are passed on through higher wages and 

prices, interest rates are likel
y to increase as monetary 
policy is tightened to control inflation. The moderation 

of world growth is probably due
, in part, to the impact 
of higher oil prices. However, there are several factors 

that suggest that the world economy should be able to 
cope with higher oil prices. 
Even though oil prices have recently reached record 
levels in nominal terms, the 
price in real terms remains 
far from the historical highs seen in 1981. In the latter 

year, the oil price averaged 62.1 EUR/bl. in 1995 euro-

area prices, compared to the average estimated real 

price of 27.5 in 2004. Furthermore, the current increase 

in oil prices is relatively small in percentage terms, 

when compared to other episodes of rising oil prices. 
Moreover, the global economy has become less 
vulnerable to higher oil 
prices, as industrialised 
countries have become more energy efficient compared 

to previous episodes of higher oil prices. Furthermore, 

the increased importance of 
excise duties, in particular 
in the EU, implies that afte
r-tax percentage changes in 
the prices of fuel products tend to be much lower than 

the percentage chan
ges in oil prices.

Despite these mitigating facto
rs, the increase in oil 
prices and the projected higher oil prices throughout the 

forecast period have dented the outlook for growth. 

Simulations carried out using the Commission™s 

QUEST model suggest that a permanent increase of oil 

prices by 25% (in USD/bl.) results in a lowering of 

GDP growth by 0.3 of a percentage point in the first 

year and by 0.1 of a percentage point in the second 

year. Furthermore, given 
the increased uncertainties in 
the oil market, downside risks have increased.

Monetary and financial conditions remain 
supportive 
Despite the apparent soft patch in growth in many 
countries in the second
 quarter of 2004, and the 
continued increases in oil prices, financial market 
developments have been characterised by stability. 
In the US, the Federal Reserv
e has, in the context of a 
maturing recovery, started to withdraw some of the 
policy accommodation injected in 2001-03, but real and 

nominal interest rates remain, nevertheless, very low.

Risks have increased 
Despite the continued outlook for robust growth in the 
world economy, risks have increased. The probable 

persistence of higher oil prices and their increased 

volatility imply greater uncertainty about future growth. 

Furthermore, despite the apparent success of some 

tightening measures, the risk of a sharp slowdown in 

China remains a downside risk for the global economy. 

Finally, imbalances in the 
US economy still constitute a 
source of downside risk. Hous
ehold indebtedness is still 
at record levels, and the current account deficit has 

continued to widen. A more abrupt adjustment of these 

imbalances would imply sign
ificantly lower growth in 
the US economy and, by implication, significant 

consequences for the worl
d economy through financial 
market instability, lower tr
ade growth and associated 
effects on confidence. 
Outlook by region  
TheUS economy
 is slowing down to a more moderate 
rate of expansion following 
a growth spurt, which lifted 
real GDP by 5% in the twelve months to the first 

quarter of this year. The slowdown to 3.3% annualised 

growth in the second quarter was primarily due to 

sharply lower consumer spending growth, although 

declining net exports also played a role. Investment, on 

the other hand, expanded brisk
ly in the context of high 
profits and low interest rates and despite a relatively 

low capacity utilisation rate in industry. 

Notwithstanding the current 
strength in investment, 
consumption growth is expected to be relatively 

subdued over the forecast period. Fiscal policy has little 

leeway to provide further stimulus to growth, while the 

very accommodative stance of monetary policy is being 

rolled back to more neutral levels. US growth is, 

therefore, expected to slow to 3% in 2005 and 2.9% in 

2006, slightly below the 
estimated potential growth 
rate. The current account defic
it is expected to continue 
to deteriorate, reaching 5.5% of GDP in 2004 and 5.8% 

in 2005, before declining 
marginally to 5.7% of GDP in 
2006. The economic recovery in 
Japan has become more 
broadly based, underpinned not only by external 

demand but also by structural improvements in the 

corporate and the financial sectors. In the first half of 

2004, the main sources of growth were private 

expenditure and net exports. Private consumption 

growth was supported by a more favourable labour 

market situation and a prolong
ed decline in the savings 
rate. Private investment kept on expanding, in line with 

robust profit growth and exports continued to expand 

briskly. It seems very likely, 
however, that the peak of 
the upturn has passed and that growth will continue at a 

more subdued pace. Growth is expected to average 

some 4.2% in 2004 and to decelerate, but remain above 

the economy™s potential gro
wth rate throughout the 
forecast period, registering 2.1% and 2.3%, 
respectively, in 2005 and 2006. 
TheChineseeconomy
 has continued to be an engine of 
world growth, with 9.1% in
 2003 and 9.7% in the first 
half of 2004. Growth has been driven in particular by 

the very strong performance 
of fixed investment, which 
has prompted concerns about overheating and 

overinvestment in several secto
rs. In response to these 
concerns, monetary and administrative measures have 

been taken to curtail investment and fiscal policy has 

been tightened. The governm
ent™s tightening efforts 
seem to have been effective in curbing investment

r of 2004, bu
t exports and 
retail sales remain relatively
 robust. Looking ahead, 
growth is expected to reach 9.2% in 2004, before 
slowing down to around 8.2% in 2005 and 2006.  
Growth momentum in the 
rest of Asia
 is expected to 
strengthen in 2004, and the re
gion is set to continue to 
make a substantial contribution to global growth. 

Several Asian economies are expected to achieve real 

GDP growth in excess of 6% this year, underpinned by 

sustained robust growth of
 exports as the global 
recovery matures, and rebounding domestic demand. 

Growth in India is expected to strengthen slightly from 

6.4% in 2004 to 6.6% by the end of the forecast horizon 

with structural reforms and 
world trade continuing to 
support growth. InLatin America
, the recovery of economic activity, 
following the 2002 contrac
tion, has gathered strong 
momentum in 2004, and the region™s overall GDP is 

projected to grow by 4.7% this year. The main 

explanatory factors include: the strengthening of global 

demand, higher commodity prices, the return of foreign 

investors™ confidence with significantly lower risk 

premia on bonds, as well as still-competitive exchange 

rates (despite the appreciations experienced since early 

2003). Over the rest of th
e forecast period, growth 
should remain strong, alth
ough a moderate slowdown is 
expected to around 3.7% in 2005 and 2006.  
TheCIS region
 is currently enjoying very high growth, 
thanks to the boom in th
e oil sector in Russia and 
Kazakhstan. Growth rates have reached or are close to 
double-digit levels in several CIS countries. 
Non-oil-producing economies (such as Ukraine and 
Belarus) are also booming, supported by a pick-up in 

regional trade and, in some cases, by the beneficial 

effects of incipient structural reforms. The upswing 

seems quite solid and should continue over the forecast 

period, albeit at a somewhat slower, but still quite 
strong, pace. Sustained high prices fo
r hydrocarbons are boosting Russia™s
 economy (the country ranks first and second in 
the world in terms of na
tural gas and oil exports 
respectively). In 2004, GDP is set to grow at a rate 

exceeding 7% for the second year running. Despite 

double-digit growth in imports, the current account 

surplus is projected 
to remain above 9% of GDP. The 
upswing appears broad-based, as both consumption and 

investment have been performing well. Since net 

exports are projected to grow more slowly in the 

coming years, GDP growth is set to decelerate 

gradually over the forecast horizon and should be 

increasingly supported by consumption and investment. 

Growth in 2005 and 2006 is, however, expected to 
remain above the 5% mark.

 % contribution
The composition of growth has 
turned out to be rather 
different from that envisaged 
in the spring. At that time, 
a zero growth contribution of net exports was projected 

for 2004, with euro-area exports and imports both 

growing at around 5%. In 
fact, exports grew at an 
average rate of 2.3% q-o-q in 
the first half of the year, 
against 1.6% for imports. Domestic demand, on the 

other hand, was su
rprisingly weak: on average 0.3% q-
o-q in the first half of the year, with 0.5% for private 

consumption and no growth
 in gross fixed capital 
formation. 
Specialisation has helped European exporters  
In 2004, the world economy 
should grow at its fastest 
rate since the seventies, reflecting the synchronised 
global recovery. The resu
lting dynamism in world 
imports (increasing by almost
 10%) has translated into 
a vigorous expansion of the export markets of the EU 

(8.6% growth), which seems to have been sufficient to 

offset, to some extent, 
unfavourable competitiveness 
developments. The downward correction of the real 

effective exchange rate of the EU since the start of 2004 

has been marginal compared to the close to 20% rise 
since the start of 2002.  
In 2004, the euro area should continue to lose market 
shares. This results from the poor performance of all 

euro-area countries apart from Germany, the 

Netherlands and Portugal. The losses are expected to be 

strongest in Greece, France, Italy and Finland. Among 

the non-euro-area Member States, the recently-acceded 

Member States are set to perform better, with all 

countries, apart from Cyprus and Malta, increasing their 

market shares. The UK is also expected to suffer a 

considerable loss in market shares.

Nevertheless, the current lev
els of exchange rates do 
not appear to have prevented European firms from 
increasing their exports. One possible explanation for 

this is that the euro
 exchange rate is 
still fairly valued, 
as suggested by the fact that the real effective exchange  
1919Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2004 
- 20 - 
rate (deflated by unit labour 
costs) of the euro area is 
still close to its long-term 
average. Additionally, the 
appreciation may have induce
d European exporters to 
improve the non-price elements of their 

competitiveness, such as 
the quality of exported 
products and/or the produc
t composition of the export 
basket. Finally, the wideni
ng of profit margins during 
the period when the euro was weaker may have 

provided European exporters with sufficient room to 

reduce margins substantially duri
ng the period of euro 
appreciation. As input prices for manufacturers have 

risen strongly this year, exporters may even have 

continued to export at a loss 
in those markets that are 
subject to high market-entry costs. 
European exporters were also helped by the product 
composition of their export basket. Between the second 
quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2004, the 
global investment cycle 
turned strongly upwards: 
besides the boom in China, 
investment in equipment 
growth exceeded 10% in the US and Japan. At the same 
time, EU exports grew above 
average, since investment 
goods absorb a fairly large 
share of EU exports (18% in 
2003).  IEATPTNLITFRESELDEBE0246810121405101520

The share of investment goods in total exports also 
provides a partial explanation for the divergent export 
performances of the individual Member States. With 

the exception of France, a 
positive correlation exists 
between the share of investment goods in the export 
basket of a Member State and its export performance 

during the last four quarters. Outside the euro area, 
Sweden and the Czech Republic have also experienced 
a high share of investment 
goods and strong export 
growth.  
An additional explanation for the better recent export 
performance of Germany and Austria lies in the more 
favourable evolution of thei
r competitivene
ss. Outside 
the euro area, this is also the case for Sweden. 
Overhang helps domestic demand growth in 2004  
Domestic demand has remained weak in 2004. The 
relatively high annual growth rate foreseen for 2004 

(1.9% in the euro area, 2.4% in EU) originates in the 

overhang from 2003. One-off 
increases in gross fixed 
capital formation and inventor
y building in the last 
quarter of 2003 were responsible for this. 
An uneven upturn in private consumption  
Recent developments in private consumption have been 
weak and rather uneven. In both the euro-area and the 
EU, an apparent revival in th
e first quarter of this year 
did not persist. The evolution of private consumption 

expenditure has also been different across Member 

States. Over the last four quarters, the average growth 

rate of private consumptio
n surpassed its long-term 
average in the majority of 
EU Member States. But the 
aggregates for the euro area and the EU were depressed 

by Germany and, to a lesser extent, Italy, the 
Netherlands and Austria. 
However, a comparison with 
previous cycles has shown 
that, in those Member States with stronger growth rates, 
consumption growth in this upturn has not been as 

strong as would have been expected from previous 

experience.

In addition, in the peri
od 2001-2003, consumption 
expenditure in the euro area was weaker than would 

have been predicted from the evolution of disposable

contrary, the household savings rate increased, although 

more recently there have been signs that the savings

Aggregate savings developmen
ts also hide divergent 
evolutions in individual Member States. The euro-area 
aggregate is heavily influenced by developments in 
France, where the saving
s rate declined substantially, 
from 16.6% in 2002 to an estimated 14.9% in 2004. 
This coincided with a release of pent-up demand, as 
illustrated by the 7.7% y-o-y increase in consumption of 

durable goods during the firs
t eight months of 2004.  
However, this experience has not been replicated in 
other Member States (apart from Belgium, Greece, 
Poland and Sweden). It appears that, notwithstanding 

the very low level of real interest rates, concerns about 
pressures on pension systems and public finance 
developments are keeping the savings rate at an 
elevated level. Moreover, the remaining gap between 
inflation expectations and pa
st inflation perceptions in 
the consumer survey results suggests that, in some 
Member States, consumption might still be affected by 
unrealistic inflation perceptions. 
Wealth effects, originating in 
divergent developments 
in the housing market, ma
y provide an additional 
explanation for the dive
rgences in savings and 
consumer behaviour (more on this in Section 2) across 
Member States.  
A moderate recovery in investment  
With the exception of the last quarters of 2002 and 
2003, euro area investment ha
s been very weak over the 
last three years. Investment was somewhat stronger 
outside the euro-area
1, in particular in the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Cyprus, Lithuania and the United 
Kingdom.  
The analysis in Section 2 of th
is chapter suggests that, 
for the past year, the overall financial situation of EU 
companies can no longer be viewed as holding back 
investment.

Before turning to the possible causes of investment 
weakness, a qualification is necessary. The structural 
decline of the construction sector in Germany is 

depressing overall euro-area investment. At its zenith in 

mid-1994, construction investment in Germany 

accounted for 25.5% of total euro-area investment 

(construction plus equipmen
t). Since then, construction 
investment in Germany declined on average by 0.6% q-

o-q, while euro-area investment excluding construction 

in Germany increased by 0.
8% q-o-q. Although, over 
the last four quarters, euro
-area investment excluding 
construction in German
y has shown consecutive 
positive quarterly growth rates, its pace is still very 

subdued: 0.5% q-o-q on averag
e. While this rate is just 
above its long-term average growth rate, judging from 

previous cycles, a more dynamic pace would be 
expected during the upturn. 
The weakness of euro-area investment in recent years is 
probably also linked to th
e poor performance of labour

productivity growth (0.8% on average over 1996-2003, 
against 1.2% in EU). Over the forecast period, however, 

investment should be supported by a recovery in 

productivity. Appropr
iate reforms in product and labour 
markets could lift productivity even further.

 Oil prices and euro area investment growth

Oil prices (rhs, inverted scale)

yoy % ch.
Another factor that has limited gains in corporate 
income and profitability of EU firms is the increase in 

energy prices. The fact that markets no longer consider 

the oil price increase to be a temporary event does not 

bode well for the future. Th
e persistence of a much 
higher equilibrium oil price affects the future 

profitability of firms™ invest
ment projects, not only 
from the cost perspective, but also on the revenue side, 
as the higher oil price will weigh on overall demand. 
Finally, delocalisation is often cited as a possible 
explanation for the weakness of investment in the euro 

area. The argument is that euro-area multinationals are 

investing in low-wage destinations such as China and 

the recently-acceded Member States rather than in euro-
area countries.  
It is, however, difficult to 
assess the extent to which 
euro-area firms invest abroad to the detriment of 

investment at home. In the case of dynamic economies, 

such as China and most recently-acceded Member 

States, the motive of bringing production closer, in 

geographical terms, to fa
st-growing consumption, 
seems to be a main driver of foreign direct investment 

(FDI). The cost motive behind FDI, on the other hand, 

will only play a role in those activities where third 

countries are able to reach 
a sufficiently high relative 
productivity level.  In any case, a gradual form of delocalisation should not 
be viewed as a negative development for euro-area 
economies. It raises disposable income abroad and, as a 
result, expands export markets for the euro area. 

Moreover, low-wage countries export products at low 

prices, thereby raising the purchasing power of euro-

area buyers of these products. -1.0

Industry rides the global wave  
As the most open sector of the economy, the industrial 
sector usually benefits most from the strength of the 
international environment. As 
a result, the gross value 
added of the industrial sector has posted satisfactory 

growth rates more recently. But the services sector has 

also performed well so far in 2004, even the large sub-

sector including the retail trade and transport sectors 

which, up to the first quar
ter, was probably not much 
affected by the rise of the oil price, mainly because of 

the strong euro. In the euro area, the strength of the 

services sector seems to be at odds with survey results, 

which did not rise much.

Box 2.1:Some specificities behind the forecasts
Exchange rates 
For currencies in ERMII, constant nominal exchange rates 
are assumed. This means that the central rate of these 
currencies against the euro will remain constant over the 
forecast period. The currencies are: the DKK (Danish krone), 
the EEK (Estonian kroon), the LTL (Lithuanian litas) and 
SIT (Slovenian tolar). For the CYP (Cyprus pound), and the 
HUF (Hungarian forint) constant nominal exchange rates vis-
à-vis the euro are also assumed.  Constant real exchange rates 
(that is nominal rates adjusted for changes in GDP deflators) 
are assumed for the PLN (Polish zloty), CZK (Czech 
koruna), SKK (Slovakian koruna), SEK (Swedish krona) and 
GBP (UK Pound). Constant real exchange rates are also 
assumed for non-EU currencies.  
The reference period used for the exchange rate constancy 
assumption is the average excha
nge rate of 27 September to 8 
October 2004, which is attributed to the fourth quarter of 
2004. The average USD/EUR rate for that period was 1.23 
and the JPY/EUR rate 136.6. This leads to implied average 
USD/EUR rates of 1.23 in 2004 and 1.24 in 2005 and 2006, 
and average JPY/EUR rates of 134.3, 133.9 and 130.1, 
respectively, in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  
For the remaining recently-acceded Member States, 
currencies are treated according to their policy regimes. 

Hence for currencies pegged to a basket (Latvian lat and 
Maltese lira), the future rate is deduced from the evolution of 
the currencies constituting the basket. 
Interest rates
Short-term interest rates are set in order to reflect the price 
stability objective of monetary policy. Long-term interest rate 
assumptions are based on developments in short-term rates 
and an assessment of economic conditions.  Attention is paid 
to international financial linkages, market expectations and 
budgetary developments. 
Commodity prices
Commodity prices are forecast taking into account market 
conditions. In the case of oil prices special attention is paid to 
futures prices. Prices for Brent oil are, accordingly, projected 
to be 39.3 USD/bl in 2004, 45.1 USD/bl in 2005 and 
40.1 USD/bl in 2006.   
Prices of primary commodities, excluding fuels, are assumed 
to increase by 12.9% in 2004, to decline by 2.9% in 2005 and 
to remain almost stable in 2006. The strongest price increases 
in 2004 apply to the group of metals, with a 36% annual rise. 
In 2005, the prices of all groups, except for fuel products and 
metals, are expected to decline compared to 2004.  
Budgetary dataData for 2003 are based on the Excessive Deficit Procedure 
notification, submitted by the Member States in September 
2004. This information is found in a Eurostat Report of 23 
September (press release 117/2004).For year 2004, the 
budgets and information on the execution of these budgets 
are taken into account. For 2005, budgets adopted or 
presented to parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For 2006, the 
"no-policy change" assumption used in the forecasts implies 
the extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends and the 
inclusion of measures that are known in sufficient detail at 
the time of the completion of the forecast. 
The government balances reported in the notification may be 
different from those published in the national accounts, 

because of an amendment to ESA95. According to 
Regulation (EC) N° 2558/2001 on the reclassification of 
settlements under swaps agreements and forward rate 
agreements, interest flows under swaps have been reclassified 
from ﬁincome propertyﬂ to ﬁfinancial accountﬂ. However, the 
Regulation states the need for specific treatment of these 
flows for data transmitted under the Excessive Deficit 
Procedure, allowing for interest expenditure to include 
swaps, contrary to ESA95 new rules. In the forecasts, it is the 
EDP definition of general government balances that is 
presented. Therefore, the calculation of general government 
expenditure does include swap-related settlements. 
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output gaps
Year 2004 is a leap year. The addition of one extra working 
day implies that EU annual output increases, other things 

being equal, by about 0.3 of a percentage point.  Annual GDP 
figures are not adjusted for the number of working days, 
while quarterly national accounts figures of most countries 
are. This implies that the simple addition of the four quarters 
of a single year may not add up exactly to the annual figure. 
Moreover, the calculation of potential GDP, from which the 
output gap is derived, does not involve any adjustment for the 
number of working days in the leap year, because this is 
considered to be a temporary phenomenon, which should not 
affect the cyclically adjusted balances that are calculated 
using these output gaps. Hence, for 2004, any increase in the 
negative output gap would be larger in the absence of this 
calendar phenomenon.

2. Financial conditions in the EU non-
financial private sectorFinancial conditions exert a crucial influence on short- 
and medium-term developments in the real economy. 

This section reviews the 
financial health and the 
evolution of financing of 
the corporate and household 
sectors, and their potential im
plications for investment 
and consumption spending.  
Non-financial corporations
The EU corporate sector has continued to benefit from 
low financing costs in 2004: equity prices, after the rise 
in 2003, have fluctuated in a relatively narrow range; 

short- and long-term bank lending rates have remained 

low in absolute levels and 
in real terms; and corporate 
spreads have moved only marginally above the end-

2003 historical lows.

:Bank lendin
g rates to euro-area households 
Companies have used the availability of funding at low 
interest rates mainly to impr
ove the structure of their 
debt and to reduce financing 
costs. The distribution of 
corporate bond issuance over 
the past twelve months 
suggests that companies had satisfied most of their 

investment funding needs by the end of 2003, in 

anticipation of higher interest
 rates in 2004. While gross 
issuance of corporate bonds has continued to grow, net 
issuance has fallen sharply in
 the first half of 2004 
relative to the corresponding 
period of 2003. Efforts to 
reduce debt levels have also been made with companies 

disposing of core assets an
d using their expanding cash 
balances - due to earlier cost-cutting and stronger 

profits - to finance buy-back transactions.

: Euro-area corporate bond spreads (over  
                    government bonds)
As a result of these efforts, 
the ratio of debt to GDP in 
the euro-area non-financial corporate sector started to 

decline in the second half 
of 2003 (though it remains 
high at around 65%), the aver
age maturity of corporate 
liabilities has been lengthened, and the debt/equity ratio 

has diminished substantially
 from the peak in early-
2003 (though only to the levels of mid-2002). 

Moreover, the recovery in profitability, which began at 

the end of 2002, has now extended into 2004. While 

higher profits were initially generated almost 

exclusively by cost-cutting measures, revenues have 

been rising since mid-2003. Forecasts of market 

earnings have recently been revised downward but 
remain relatively upbeat.  
24Chapter 2 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
- 25 - 
These developments have been reflected in a general 
improvement in market indicators of corporate 
creditworthiness, such as spreads between corporate 

and government bond yields, and credit rating 

assessments. The ECB bank-lending survey for July 

2004 showed a continuing 
fall in the percentage of 
banks reporting a tightening of corporate credit 

standards, with the balance reporting a net easing in 

conditions for the first time 
since the survey began in January 2003.  The exception to thes
e generally favourable 
developments may be the small and medium-sized 
enterprise (SME) sector. The number of business 

failures amongst SMEs has continued to increase in 

some Member States. This probably reflects the fact 

that SMEs are typically unable to exploit directly 

favourable financial-market conditions, and are also 

likely to benefit less than 
large international companies 
from strong growth abroad. Successive ECB Bank 

Lending Surveys have shown 
tighter lending standards 
for SMEs than for large companies, though the latest 

survey (July 2004) has poin
ted to a substantial easing of 
standards in the second
 quarter 2004, and to a 
pronounced increase in loan demand from SMEs.

                     level and maturity structure
Favourable financing conditions and improved 
profitability have not yet tr
anslated into a sustained 
increase in investment expend
itures. After a brief pick-
up in the fourth quarter of 2004, capital spending in the 

euro area slowed down in the first half of 2004, and as 

such might be the primary factor behind the 
deceleration in debt financing in recent quarters.  
The aggregate picture hides substantial differences in 
the financial behaviour of the corporate sector across 
Member States. In Germany, where the need to repair 
balance-sheets was perhaps 
relatively more acute, non-
financial corporations ran a financial surplus in both 

2002 (0.6% of GDP) and 2003 (0.2% of GDP). 

Surpluses were achieved largely by cutting investment 

expenditures. Moreover, German companies have 

increasingly financed their reduced investment 

expenditures from internal 
funds (86.1% in
 2003, up 
from 50.1% in 2000). In France and Italy, companies 

have continued to be net borrowers, while the financial 

surplus of companies in 
the United Kingdom has 
reached a ten-year high, due to lower investment 

spending, rising profits 
and dividend cutbacks.

                    companies
On the whole, the overall financial situation of EU 
companies clearly improved in the past two years with 
respect to 2001-2002. Even 
though levels of debt and 
capital gearing ratios remain high and some further 

balance sheet adjustment cannot be excluded, non-
financial corporations are currently able, on average, to 
access external finance at low costs. Moreover, many 

companies have been accumulating unusually large 
amounts of liquid financial assets, to the point of 
coming under pressure to give part of them back to 

shareholders. Accordingly, the source of the current 
weakness in investment seems more likely to be found 
in uncertainties concerning the medium-term demand 

outlook. In this context, 
investment plans could be 
further scaled down if external demand were to falter 
and/or if the euro were to
 appreciate fu
rther (denting 
exporters™ profit margins). Rising commodity price and 
reduced scope for cost-efficiency improvements could 
also be weighing on investment prospects.

Households  
Household borrowing in the EU has continued to 
expand at a brisk pace, supp
orted by the low level of 
interest rates. The annual growth rate in household 

borrowing in the euro area accelerated to 7.3% in July 

2004, up from 6.4% in December 2003. Including also 

loans originating from finan
cial institutions other than 
euro-area MFIs, the dynamics of household debt is even 

stronger (for instance, the annu
al growth rate of this 
wider aggregate in Q1-2004 was 7.4%, as compared to 

6.6% for euro-area MFI loans). Loans for house 

purchases have remained the most dynamic component 

of total borrowing, reaching 
an annual growth rate of 
9.2% in July 2004. Credit standards applied to housing 

loans eased during the second quarter of 2004, and loan 
demand has remained strong
, according to the ECB 
bank lending survey in July 2004.

Consumer credit has also accelerated in 2004, 
consistent with the moderate revival in private 
consumption. As a result, the stock of euro-area 

household debt now exceeds 
80% of disposable income 
and 53% of GDP. While th
ese levels are not 
particularly high by international standards, the degree 

of dispersion within the euro area (and the EU more 

generally) is high. In particular, the debt-to-disposable-

income ratio is well above average in the Netherlands, 

Portugal, Germany, Ireland and Spain. Households 

borrowing has been growing fast also in non-euro-area 

Member States. Debt-to-disposable-income ratios are 

high in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden. In 

contrast, household debt ratios are generally relatively 

low in the recently-acceded Member States, reflecting a  
less advanced state of financial intermediation, but

House price inflation has con
tinued at a relatively rapid 
pace on average but seems to have peaked in some 

Member States. In the euro area as a whole, house 

prices rose by more than 7% in both 2002 and 2003. 

While house prices have been decelerating in the 

Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, they have been 

accelerating in Italy and France. In the United 

Kingdom, house price inflatio
n seems to be slowing, in 
response to successive interest rate hikes. Nevertheless, 

house price levels remain high and buy-to-let-

mortgages have become increasingly common.In 

general, the outlook for house prices in each Member 

State hinges on a number of country-specific factors, 

including the degree of overvaluation of current prices,

So far, high levels of indebtedness have not given rise 
to solvency concerns, because the net worth of 

households is generally 
positive and debt-servicing 
costs have been limited by low interest rates. 

Nevertheless, high debt ra
tios constitute an element of 
fragility with respect to chan
ges in asset prices, income 
or interest rates. In particular, a rise in short-term 

interest rates would reduce disposable income of 
households with variable-rate mortgage contracts. In 
this respect, it is noteworthy that the share of flexible 

interest rate mortgages in the 
euro area has been rising 
in recent years (to 55% of new loans for house purchase 
in recent months). 
In some countries, the combin
ation of record high debt 
levels and house prices raises concerns for the potential 

consequences of the expected slowdown in house 

prices. In a context of risi
ng interest rates and low 
inflation, even the 
possibility of declines in nominal 
house prices cannot be excluded. To the extent that a 

positive housing wealth effect has supported 

consumption in some Member States in recent years, 

the opposite effect might also act as a drag on 

consumption growth. For instance, a negative housing 

wealth effect seems to have contributed to depressing 

consumption in the Netherlands. Structural factors and 

the sharp rise in both hous
e prices and household debt 
in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Sweden 

imply some risks to demand from the housing market in 

these countries. However, the aggregate effect in the 

EU as a whole is likely to be contained, as house price 

inflation has been relatively 
moderate in the larger 
euro-area Member States (and consequently prices are 

generally not considered to be overvalued) and price 
cycles have not been
 fully synchronised.

3. Consolidation of growth over the forecast 
horizonDownward revision for 2005  
Although the growth outcome for the whole of 2004 is 
likely to exceed th
e expectations set out in the spring, 
the growth momentum envisaged for the second half of 
2004 is weaker than anticipated in the spring. The effect 
of the continued rise in oil 
prices has led to a downward 
revision of the projected an
nual growth rate in 2005. 
Although the growth rate proj
ected for 2006 is close to 
that of 2005, its composition is slightly different: 
domestic demand is set to b
ecome somewhat stronger 
and the external contribution turns slightly more 
negative. 
Domestic demand takes over from 2005 onwards 
EU exports are set to decelerate marginally in 2005, as 
the slowdown in exports of go
ods is partly compensated 
by an acceleration in services. Import growth is 

expected to remain almost unchanged over the forecast 

horizon, in line with final demand. The net external 

contribution turns negative from 2005 onwards. A pick-

up in employment and investment should transform the 

current externally-led rec
overy into a self-sustaining 
one. 
In the euro area, domestic de
mand is set to be supported 
by an acceleration in its two main components, namely 

private consumption and gro
ss fixed capital formation. 
Outside the euro area, domestic demand should 

decelerate in 2005, mainly due to developments in the 

United Kingdom. Nevertheless, domestic demand in the 

EU is expected to grow at 
a robust 2.4-2.6% during the 
forecast period. Private consumption growth sh
ould be underpinned by 
an increase in real disposable income, originating in a 

pick-up in employment and 
real wages, and a slight 
decrease in inflation. Encour
aging labour productivity 
developments, the improved overall financial situation 

of EU companies and an increase in demand are 

expected to stimulate investment in equipment during 
the forecast period. After three years of stagnation or 
decline, euro-area investment in construction is set to 

grow again in 2004. This is the case for all euro-area 

Member States, except Germany.

RisksRecent indicators, while not consistently positive, 
confirm the robust momentum in the major economies. 
The synchronised nature of the global upturn has 

increased its sustainability a
nd created an upward risk 
to the export forecast. However, higher and volatile oil 

prices and other commodity prices might put a damper 

on global growth. The US economy, which has 

remained the major driver of global growth, is 

characterised by long-standing macro-economic 

imbalances that may act as a brake on growth later in 
the forecast period. 
The global current account imbalances may give rise to 
large exchange rate adjustments. A renewed sharp 
appreciation in the euro exchange rate could undermine 
activity mainly in the euro
-area manufacturing sector. 
28Chapter 2 
The economies of the euro area and the EU 
- 29 - 
On the other hand, any further appreciation would ease 
inflationary pressures and, accordingly, raise real 
disposable income. 
Consumption 
A faster-than-expected dec
line in inflation would be 
supportive for real disposable income growth and, most 

likely, for consumption growth. Such a scenario could 

occur through favourable de
velopments in commodity 
and food prices. However, a continuation of the upward 

trend in oil prices poses a downward risk to 

consumption. The recovery in employment, foreseen 

for 2005 and 2006, is not very rapid. A more 

pronounced pick-up in cyc
lical productivity would 
constrain employment growth.  
The wealth effect of the rise in stock markets since the 
end of the war in Iraq may tu
rn out to be larger than 
expected. Much will depend 
on households™ assessment 
of the stabilisation in stock 
markets since March 2004. 
In some Member States, the combination of record high 
debt levels and house prices raises concerns for the 

potential consequences of the expected slowdown in 
house prices.  
To the extent that a positive housing wealth effect has 
supported consumption in some Member States in 
recent years, any possible correction in housing markets 
due to overheating could act as a drag on consumption 
growth. 
Investment 
While investment is bei
ng supported by favourable 
financing conditions and po
sitive developments in 
earnings and profitability, the high oil price and the 

hesitant nature of the recovery in consumer demand 

may be holding back investme
nt plans. Visible progress 
in product and labour market reforms, on the other 

hand, could boost confidence and increase the expected 
productivity and profitability
 of new investment.  
It should also be recognis
ed that technical progress, 
specifically in information and communication 
technology, has shortened the average life-cycle of 
productive equipment, increasing the need for 

replacement investment.

4. A mild acceleration of employment growth
A resilient labour market  
Over the past two years, em
ployment developments in 
the EU have been subdued, a lagged response to the 
prolonged economic slowdo
wn of 2001-
2003. Year-on-year employment growth decelerated from 1.4% in 

2001 to just 0.2% in the euro area in 2003 and from 1% 

in 2001 to 0.3% in
 the EU. On the other hand, structural 
labour market adjustments in the recently-acceded 

Member States, on top of the cyclical impact of the 

slowdown, have led to a decline of employment by 
0.5% between 2001 and 2003.  
In the euro area and the EU, employment came to a 
standstill in the second half of 2002. Total employment 

remained virtually unchanged in the two regions last 
year and developments this
 year do not indicate any 
noticeable pick-up. In the first half of 2004, the level of 

employment was practically flat in the euro area. At the 
Member State level, available hard data for the second 
quarter are more mixed but remain consistent with 
sluggish employment growth 
in the region as a whole. 
Employment rose in Spain and Italy, but declined 

marginally in both Ge
rmany and France.  
Subdued short-term employment prospects 
Survey data for the second and third quarters of 2004 
suggest that employment 
conditions may now be 
somewhat better than at the beginning of the year. 

According to the PMI for the manufacturing sector, the 

assessment of employment co
nditions improved in the 
second and third quarters compared to the first. 

Moreover, the closeness of the index to the 50 mark 

(which is interpreted as separating expansions from 

contractions) would appear 
to presage no further job 
losses in the sector. Similar developments are detected 

in employment expectations in the Commission™s 

industry survey. However, the volatility of recent data 
suggests that the improvement
 should be interpreted 
with due caution.  
A modest improvement of employment expectations is 
indicated also in the services sector, according to the 

PMI and the Commission™s business survey data. While 

both indicators track actual developments in 
employment relatively well, they are still consistent 
with weak short-term employment prospects. 

Furthermore, according to the Commission™s survey 

data, a gap has built up over the summer between 

companies™ expectations and their assessment of the 

recent past, showing that current employment 

developments have recovered more slowly than 

expectations. Overall, a significant acceleration of 

employment growth during the second half of the year 
appears unlikely. 
Sluggish labour market developments for the remainder 
of this year are also supported by data on 

unemployment expectations. Households™ 

unemployment expectations deteriorated in the second 

quarter of 2004 and, despite the fact that households 

were more optimistic in the third quarter concerning 

their labour market prospect
s, the current level of 
unemployment expectations remains above its long-

term average.

Euro-area employment growth and 
                     unemployment  
All in all, for the year 2004 as a whole, employment 
growth is estimated at 0.5% in the euro area and 0.4% 
in the EU. In absolute terms,
 this translates into 0.6 
million new jobs in the euro area and 0.8 million in the 

EU. This year, France, Finland and the Netherlands are 
set to experience negative employment growth. 
Germany should see a return to positive employment

growth, although this is likely to remain weak given the 
export-led nature of the recovery. In contrast, 
employment is projected to remain dynamic in Greece, 
Spain, Ireland and Luxembour
g. Outside the euro area, 
employment growth should remain above the EU 
average in the UK and should
 be relatively stronger in 
the smaller recently-aceeded Member States. On the 

other hand, employment is set to fall in the Czech 
Republic, Poland and Sweden.  
As a result of job creation, which is projected to rise in 
line with labour supply, un
employment is expected to 
remain stable this year (com
pared to 2003), in both the 
euro area and the EU. Total 
unemployment in the euro 
area is estimated at 12.6 million in 2004 (19.4 in the 

EU), an increase of about 0.1 million people in both the 
euro area and the EU compared to last year. It is 
anticipated that the unemployment rate will be 8.9% in 

the euro area and 9.1% in the EU. However, a 
deceleration in the unemployment rate is expected in 
Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Austria, Finland and, 
among the EU non-euro-area Member States, in 
Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Li
thuania, Poland, Slovenia 
and the UK. 
A mild acceleration in employment in the medium-
termThe outlook for employment for 2005 and 2006 is more 
encouraging. However, altho
ugh the conso
lidation of the recovery does not pose any apparent obstacle to 

employment growth in view of the usual lagged 

response of the labour market to the economic cycle, 

the pattern of employment growth is likely to remain 

softer compared to previous business cycle recoveries. 

Various elements contribute to a relatively subdued 
medium-term outlook. 
On the positive side, employment growth is expected to 
benefit from the shift in the sources of growth over the 

forecast period. Compared to 2004, GDP growth in the 
coming two years is projected to be more broad-based 
with a higher contribution from domestic demand and a 

reduction of the strong contribution from net trade. This 
change in the composition 
of growth is likely to 
increase the employment content of the recovery.  
Weak job creation ahead? 
However, offsetting elements are also in place. First, 
employment was unusually resilient during the last 
downturn and did not contract
 either in the euro area or 
in the EU. The initial response 
of firms to the slowdown 
was to cut back on capital spe
nding rather than on their 
wage bill. Labour cutbacks 
emerged once the downturn 
became more protracted and expectations concerning its 
length changed. Some labour-hoarding may have taken 

place as suggested by the stronger deterioration in the 
cyclical component of labour productivity compared to 
previous slowdowns.

One possible consequence of employment resilience in 
the slowdown is a more mute
d response in the upswing. 
In fact, the pick up of employment appears to be 
somewhat weaker compared to past business cycle 
phases. In addition, the pattern of employment creation 

is more subdued in those sectors, such as financial 
intermediation, which were 
less severely hit in the 
downturn. The hypothesis of modest future job creation 

finds additional support in
 the observation that the 
3131Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2004 
- 32 - 
current unemployment rate is only slightly higher than 
the structural unemployment 
rate. This suggests that 
there is only little labour market slack to be unwound 
during the recovery. 
Second, recently, plant-level agreements have taken 
place in a few countries to extend the working week in 

order to cut costs a
nd reduce the likelihood of 
outsourcing of economic activities, in particular to East-

Asia and the recently-acceded Member States. While 

such arrangements have implications for the medium- 

to long-term growth outlook (in the context of 

population ageing), they 
also indicate a possible 
reversal of Europe™s negative trend in working hours or, 

at least, a trend deceleration. Other things being equal, 

this would imply a milder 
increase in the number of 
persons employed. 
Third, the improved job performance in the euro-area 
labour market since the mid-1990s has been associated, 

inter alia, with the adoptio
n of more flexible labour 
market contracts and a reduction of the tax burden of 

labour, which have led to an increase in part-time work 

and fostered the incorporation 
of low-skilled people in 
the labour force. While these changes are not expected 

to be reversed over the forecast horizon, they are likely 

to continue at a less rapid pace, thereby slowing down 
employment growth and accelerating productivity. 
Fourth, following a prolonge
d period of subdued capital 
spending, investment in 2005
 and 2006 is expected to 
increase capital-labour intens
ity in the economy. This 
would also contribute to ri
sing labour productivity and 
a decline in recruitment. 
The above-mentioned factors imply that a slow 
progression of employment can be expected over the 

forecast period. Overall, employment is projected to 

rise in the euro area by 0.9% in both 2005 and 2006 and 

by 0.7% and 0.8%, respectivel
y, in the EU. Despite the 
gathering pace of employment creation in most euro-

area countries, employment growth is predicted to 

remain rather weak in Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, 

Austria and Finland. A rate of net job creation 

significantly above the euro-area average is anticipated 

only for Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg. Outside the 

euro area, employment developments are expected to 

differ significantly across 
counties. The level of 
employment is set to remain unchanged in the Czech 

Republic and employment gro
wth is expected to be 
weak in Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, Malta, 
Slovenia and the UK. By contrast, the strongest 

employment gains are estimated for Cyprus, Lithuania 
and Poland. In the latter, employment growth is 
expected to return to positiv
e territory after five years of 
contraction. 
Labour force participation is expected to rise by almost 
1 million people in the euro area and almost 1.9 in the 
EU as a whole, over the period 2005-2006. As labour 
supply is projected to incr
ease by somewhat less, the 
unemployment rate is set to decline in both regions. It is 

projected at 8.9% in the euro area in 2005 (9.1% in the 
EU) and 8.6% in 2006
 (8.8% in the EU). 
Unemployment rates in Germany, Greece, Spain and 

France are expected to remain above the euro-area 
average. Among the recently-aceeded Member States, 
the dispersion of unem
ployment rates is, not 
surprisingly given their catch
ing-up status, wider than 
within the euro-area, ra
nging from above 15% in 
countries such as Poland and Slovakia, to around 8-10% 

in the Czech Republic an
d the Baltic countries and 
between 4% and 6% in Cyprus, Slovenia and Hungary. 
The structural component of the unemployment rate is 

projected to decelerate from 8.4% in 2004 to 8.2% in 
2006 in the euro area and to stabilise around 8.7% in 
the EU as a whole. 
Limited progress towards the employment rate 
targets of the Lisbon Agenda 
The structural employment rate in the EU15, defined as 
the share of employed in the total population of the 15-
64 age group, is estimated at 64.7% in 2004 and is 
forecast to rise to 65% in 2005 and 65.4% in 2006. On 
this basis, the employment rate would remain below the 

intermediate target for 2005 (67%). Cross-country 

differences in employment rates remain wide. In some 

Member States (Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, 

Portugal, Finland, Sweden an
d the UK), employment is 
expected to remain abov
e 67% of the working 
population in 2005. However, 
the four largest euro-area 
Member States (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are 
not expected to reach the overall target by 2005. 
To meet the Lisbon 70% employment target by 2010, 
the total employment rate in the EU15 would need to 

increase by more than 5 pp. This would require an 
average annual growth rate above 1%, based on the 
optimistic assumption that 
the working-age population 
remains unchanged over this period. However, an 
annual growth rate in excess of 1% is higher than that 
recorded in 2000-2003 period. 
32- 33 - 
5. Inflation below 2% in the medium term
Various factors behind inflation persistence 
Over the last four years - between August 2000 and 
August 2004 - the 
annual rate of HICP inflation in the 
euro area remained for the most part at or above 2%. 

Between 2001 and mid-
2003, the region also 
experienced a prolonged economic slowdown, while the 
nominal effective exchange rate of the euro appreciated 

from the second half of 2002 onwards. Despite the 
potential disinflationary impact of these two factors, 
inflation in the euro area has remained particularly 

sticky. The persistence of inflation 
in the euro area is partly 
due to the occurrence of adverse shocks. These include, 
inter alia, the high food 
price inflation in 2001, the 
acceleration of food prices over most of 2003, the rise 
in administered prices and indirect taxes in several 
countries in 2003-2004, high 
oil prices in 2002 and the 
strong increase in oil prices
 since the beginning of 
2004. In addition, labou
r productivity growth 
decelerated during the economic slowdown. With 
growth in compensation per head remaining broadly 
constant, this has exerted
 upward pressure on unit 
labour costs. The degree of inflation persistence was 
highest in the services sector due to the lower degree of 
competition and the higher 
influence of labour costs 
than in the industrial sector.
 Additional rigidities in the 
process of price formation, including the slow 
downward adjustment of import prices despite the 

appreciation of the euro, also contributed to the 
stickiness of inflation. 
Inflation eased below 2% in ear
ly 2004 in 
both the euro 
area and the EU as a whole, but accelerated again 
between March and August to reach 2.3% in the euro 

area, before easing to 2.1% in September. The evolution 

of inflation in 2004 is attrib
utable mainly to movements 
in energy prices and can be explained by two factors: 

first, the reversal of the favourable base effect that 
contributed to the decline in in
flation in the first quarter 
of the year as oil and energy prices fell sharply after the 

start of the Iraq war; and second, the gradual 

transmission to consumer prices of the increase in oil 

prices over the past few months. By contrast, 
developments in unprocessed food, the other non-core 
inflation component, have been decelerating since 

October 2003.

HICP
Core inflation (HICP excluding energy and unprocessed 
food) has also moved upwards, from 1.9% in January to 
2.2% in August. The rise in 
underlying inflation is the 
result of higher processed fo
od inflation in early 2004, 
stemming from increases in indirect taxes on tobacco in 
several Member States, combined with accelerating 
service inflation due to upward pressure from 

administered prices. In September, core inflation 
decelerated to 2%. 
The euro area continues to be characterised by a broad 
dispersion of inflation rates, with the September data 
ranging from 0.2% in Finland to above 3% in Spain and 
Luxembourg. Headline inflation is currently above 2% 

in eight of the twelve euro-area countries.  
Inflation outlook: Short-term upward revision due 
to energy prices 
Updated information suggests 
that headline inflation 
may remain above 2% for longer than anticipated in the 
Spring 2004 forecasts. Developments in oil and energy 

prices are the chief elements behind the expected
3333Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2004 - 34 - 
upward shift in the profile 
for inflation over the coming 
months. With current oil prices close to 50 USD/bl., a 

rapid decrease is not anticipated in the near future. In 

the months to come, the direct impact of higher oil 

prices via the energy component of the HICP could be 

compounded by indirect effects on the prices of other 

goods and services through
 the effect of higher input 
costs for energy. There is some evidence of this effect 

already in producer prices. 
The latter have edged higher 
in the past few months not only because of accelerating 

prices in the energy sector but also reflecting increasing 

price pressures in the in
termediate goods sector.

In addition to the direct and indirect effects mentioned 
above, higher oil prices could have a further impact on 
inflation. If workers attempt to
 recoup past losses in 
purchasing power, the result could be a wage-price 
spiral triggered by rising 
wage claims and generally 
anticipated by an upward
 revision of households™ 
inflation expectations. Reassuringly, second round 
effects from higher oil prices to heightened wage claims 
and accelerating final prices were limited during the 

1999-2000 oil shock. Given the weakness of domestic 
demand and the slack in the labour market, wage claims 
are expected to remain moderate also at this juncture. In 
fact, recent developments in
 terms of labour costs and 
inflation expectations are fairly encouraging. The 

annual growth rate in compensation per employee 
remained unchanged at 2.
1% in the first quarter of 
2004, while unit-labou
r-cost growth was 1%, the lowest 
increase since 2000. Hourly labour costs growth was 
2.2% in the second quarter of 2004, down from 2.7% in 
the first.  Evidence from inflation expectations is more mixed. 
Household expectations of 
short-term inflation, as 
measured in the Commission™s consumer survey, have 
not drifted upwards so 
far. Similarly, long-term 
inflation expectations report
ed by the ECB™s survey of 
professional forecasters for the third quarter of this year 
remained unchanged at 1.9%. On the other hand, the 
survey reported an upward revision of short-term 

inflation expectations fro
m 1.9% to 2.1% for 2004.  
Overall, inflation in the euro
 area is expected to remain 
above 2% for the remainder of this year and the first 
quarter of 2005, mainly as a result of energy price 

developments. For 2004 as a whole, HICP inflation is 
estimated at 2.1% in the euro area and 2.2% in the EU. 
Compared to the Commission™s Spring 2004 forecasts, 

inflation has been revised upwards in most euro-area 
countries. Greece is an exception due to lower-than-
expected inflation recorded over the summer. Marginal 

downward revisions are envisaged also in the 
Netherlands and Finland. In Germany, France, Ireland, 
Luxembourg and Portugal, HICP inflation in 2004 has 
been affected by the impact of changes in indirect 
taxation and administered prices.  
Moderate external and domestic price pressures in 
the medium term
Looking forward, inflation is expected to decelerate 
through 2005, falling from 2.2% in the first quarter of 

the year to about 1.8% in th
e remaining quarters. At the 
beginning, the easing of inflation results from the 

assumed deceleration of oil prices, which translates into 

lower energy inflation. Inflation in 2005 is also 

expected to benefit from lower rises in indirect taxes 

and administered prices compared to 2004. Overall, 

HICP inflation is projected at 1.9% in 2005 and 1.7% in 

2006. The corresponding figures for the EU are 2.1% 

and 1.9%, respectively. On top of the dampening effect 

of the two above-mentioned f
actors, both external and 
domestic price pressures are expected to remain fairly 
weak over the forecast horizon.  
Notwithstanding the acceleration of export prices in 
some important euro-area trading partners (US, Japan, 

UK), the impact of external price pressures on HICP 

inflation is forecast to remain moderate. During the 

course of 2005, inf
lation is expected to
 benefit from the 
lagged effects of the significant past appreciation of the 

euro, so that import prices 
will remain low, putting 
downward pressure on the overall inflation rate. The 

annual rate of change in import prices in the euro area is 

projected to decelerate from 1.5% in 2005 to 0.5% in 

2006 (from 1.4% to 0.7% 
respectively in the EU). 
34Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
- 35 - 
Accordingly, the rise in import prices is set to be 
significantly lower than the 
annual rate of change in the 
GDP deflator, which is forecast at 1.8% in 2005 and 

1.7% in 2006. The corresponding figures for the EU 

are, respectively, 2% and 1.9%.

Domestic price pressures are also expected to remain 
subdued as a result of moderate wage growth and a 

limited acceleration in unit labour costs. Growth in 

compensations per employee is projected at 2.4% next 

year, rising marginally in 2006 to 2.5%. In the EU, the 

rate of change in nominal wages is forecast to be 

somewhat above 3% in both years. The relatively 

benign outlook for wage developments in 2005 rests on 

the hypothesis that the recent increase in oil prices will 

not produce significant 
second-round effects. In 
addition, the level of output in the euro area and the EU 

is projected to remain below potential in both 2005 and 

2006, while the unemployment rate is expected to 

remain fairly stable over the forecast horizon. Hence, it 

is unlikely that wages will represent a significant source 

of inflationary pressure.  
Finally, unit labour costs are expected to rise but at a 
moderate pace, benefiting from an improved pattern in 

labour productivity compared to the recent past (see 

also section 4 on the labour market). Labour 

productivity growth is forecast at just above 1% in both 

2005 and 2006 in the euro area and at 1.6% in the EU in 
both years. This is slightly above the five-year average 

growth rate recorded in both regions during the 

previous business cycle, i.
e. between 1996 and 2000. 
As a result, growth in unit la
bour costs is projected to 
be 1.2% in the euro area and 1.6% in the EU over the 

next two years. This ev
aluation implies increasing 
profit margins as measured by the difference between 
the rate of change of the GDP deflator and that of unit 

labour costs.

At the Member State level, 
HICP inflation in 2005 and 
2006 is forecast to remain
 low in Germany at around 
1.2%, held down by weak domestic demand and 
relatively high unemploymen
t. France should see 
inflation hovering around 
2% next year and falling 
below 2% in 2006, although French services sector 
inflation remains relatively high. Inflation in Italy is 
forecast to remain above the euro-area average although 

moving below 2% in the second half of 2006. Services 
inflation remains high but relatively more moderate 
wage inflation compared to other euro-area Member 

States should lead to a decline in overall inflation. In 
Spain, inflation is also expected to decelerate, while 
remaining above the euro-area average as a result of 
relatively high growth in unit 
labour costs. By contrast, 
inflation in the Netherlands is set to benefit from a 

sharp contraction in unit labour costs. As regards the 
other euro-area Member States, it is anticipated that 
inflation will remain at or below 2% in Belgium, 

Austria and Finland. Greece, on the other hand, is 
expected to record the high
est inflation rate, mainly 
reflecting the strength of domestic demand.  
Outside the euro area, inflation in the UK is projected to 
rise, reaching 2% in 2006 (current Bank of England 
target). Among the largest recently-acceded Member 
States, Poland could experience inflation close or above 

3% in both 2005 and 20
06 on the back of the 
underlying strong recovery of the economy. In 
Hungary, inflation is set to decelerate markedly in 2005 

and 2006 after being pushed up in early 2004 by large 
increases in energy and food prices. After a marginal 
3535Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2004 - 36 - 
fall in the general price inde
x in 2003, inflation in the 
Czech Republic is expected to average about 3% over 
the whole forecast horizon, largely reflecting rising unit 
labour costs. As regards the remaining recently-acceded 

Member States, the general picture is one of 
decelerating inflation between 2004 and 2006. The 
exception is Lithuani
a, which experienced deflation in 
2003.   Table 2.4

6. The recovery supports only modest fiscal 
consolidation in the euro area Underlying deficits persist in the euro area 
Following a moderate but non-negligible easing of 
fiscal policies since 2000, the recovery under way in the 
euro area since mid-2003 is expected to coincide with a 
modest discretionary tighten
ing. As a result, the general 
government deficit is set to improve over the forecast 
period, from 2.9% of GDP in 2004 to 2.5% in 2006, 
while it is anticipated that th
e cyclically-adjusted deficit 
will improve by ¼ percentage 
point to 2.2% of GDP in 
2006. The cyclically-adjusted primary balance is 
expected to also show a small improvement over the 

same period. It should be 
recalled that these figures and 
those that follow are based on current policies, that is, 
for most countries, they incorporate the measures 

announced with the budgets fo
r 2005 but do not include 
possible budgetary adjustment measures for 2005 and 
2006 beyond those resulting from policy decisions 

already taken.  
High-deficit Member States struggling 
While Member States with significant deficits remain 
committed to an adjustment
 of the order of ½% of GDP 
in cyclically-adjusted terms un
til the achievement of a 
budgetary position of close-to-balance, the forecast 

confirms the divide between those Member States that 

achieved the close-to-balance position during the 

previous upturn, and which ar
e broadly set to maintain 
the medium-term objective (the deterioration of the 

budgetary balance in Austria being the most notable 

exception in this regard) and those Member States that 

failed to implement a timely 
adjustment and are obliged 
to struggle to approach a position of underlying 
balance. Among the largest countries, which belong to the 
second group, some notable progress in this respect is 

expected to occur in Germany, although based on 

current policies the nominal deficit would fall below 

3% of GDP only in 2006. By
 contrast, the reduction of 
the deficit in France to around 3% of GDP in 2005 is 

largely attributable to a sizeable one-off measure and 
therefore is reversed in 20
06. Finally, in Italy, where 
the breach of the 3% of GDP deficit threshold has been 

avoided so far only thanks to extensive recourse to one-

off measures, based on current policies, the deficit 

could breach 3% of GDP this year and the next, and 

could increase significantly more in 2006, unless all 

announced consolidation measures are fully 
implemented. 
Of the other countries, which currently have deficits 
close to or above the 3% of GDP threshold, only the 
Netherlands, where the breach of the threshold in 2003 
coincided with a particularly severe recession, is set to 

regain a comfortable underl
ying fiscal position during 
the forecast period, on the back of the increasing 
strength of the recovery and decisive corrective action 
by the government. By contrast, in a situation of a 
persistently large negative output gap, structural 

adjustment is projected to 
stall in Portugal, leaving the 
country in a position in 
which only recourse to 
increasingly costly one-off measures can prevent a 

rebound of the deficit above the 3% of GDP threshold. 
In Greece, where successive rounds of statistical 
revisions have resulted in 
the highest budget deficit in the euro area, the deficit ma
y fall to around 3% of GDP 
only by 2006 in a context of
 continued robust growth.  
Trend reduction in revenues continues 
The modest improvement in the fiscal position of the 
euro area reflects a reduction in the expenditure ratio 

(expenditure/GDP) that is in part offset by the 
continuation of a trend of decrease in the revenue ratio 
(revenue/GDP), which at the end of the forecast period 

is set to regain, at 45% of GDP, a level comparable to 
that prevailing before th
e Maastricht-induced adjustment.  
Debt ratio in euro area to stay well above 60% of 
GDP 
Reflecting the offsetting impacts of an only slightly 
smaller deficit and nominal GDP growth, the debt-to- 
3737Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2004 
- 38 - 
GDP ratio of the euro area is forecast to stay broadly 
unchanged during the forecast period at around 71% of 
GDP. Of the six euro-area countries currently with debt 
ratios in excess of the 60% of GDP threshold (Belgium, 
Germany, Greece, France, Italy, Austria), Belgium, 
Greece, Italy and Austria are expected to reduce their 

debt ratios during the forecast period. By contrast, the 
rise of the debt ratio is set to continue in Germany, 
France and Portugal reaching values around 65% of 

GDP at the end of the forecast period.  
Diverse developments outside the euro area 
Outside the euro area, the United Kingdom will 
probably reduce the de
ficit gradually from its 
expenditure-induced peak of 3.3% of GDP in 2003 with 

the help of buoyant growth,
 although both the current 
and the primary balances would remain in slight deficit 

throughout 2005, in both nominal and cyclically-
adjusted terms. 
In most of the new Member States with high deficits, 
fiscal consolidation could 
make headway during the 
forecast period, helped in some cases by a faster-than-
expected resumption of growth
 at or above trend rates. 
The fiscal outcomes foreseen for 2004 and 2005 are 
mostly in line with or sometimes in advance of current 

adjustment plans, with the deficit in Cyprus in 

particular falling to 3% 
of GDP threshold in 2005, 
broadly in line with plans. The forecasts for the deficits 

in 2006, even on an unchanged policy basis, also appear 

broadly in line with governm
ent plans, with the deficit 
in Poland approaching the t
hreshold ahead of plans. The 
notable exception to this pattern of adjustment is 

Hungary, where the reduction in the deficit is now 

smaller than previously expected in spite of favourable 
growth conditions. 
Latvia stands out as the only case among the recently-
acceded Member States where a significant 

deterioration of the budgetar
y situation is projected 
based on current policies, with the deficit rising close to 
the 3% of GDP threshold already in 2004.

 Steady growth but some challenges ahead 
- 40 - 
Economic recovery since the second half of 2003 
After three years of weak economic growth, the 
economic activity in Belg
ium strengthened in the 
second half of 2003 and first half of 2004. Quarter-

on-previous quarter GDP rose around 0.7% in these 
four quarters. In line with signs of a moderate 
slowdown in the internatio
nal economy, some factors 
(namely survey data) have 
been pointing to somewhat 
lower economic growth in B
elgium in the second half 
of the current year.  
Both domestic and external
 demand have contributed 
to the recovery. In the first half of 2004 private 
consumption picked up 
substantially to 2.4% (year-
on-year) as a result of higher employment and higher 
consumer confidence. Gross capital formation fell by 
1.5% due to a reduction in corporations™ investment 

but is expected to impr
ove thanks to favourable 
domestic and especially external demand, an 
increasingly high capacity utilisation rate and 

continued low interest rates.
 Exports have been rising 
strongly as a result of vigorous external demand and 
the much lower appreciation of
 the euro. This should 
lead to a more balanced 
composition of growth than 
in 2003. Employment started to increase again but 
still at a low rate, not enough to reduce 

unemployment. Accordingly, productivity picked up 
vigorously, as it typically does 
in the first stages of an 
upswing. Inflation 
picked up in April and May as a 
result of the high oil prices bu
t should rise by no more 
than 2% this year compared
 to 1.5% in 2003 (HIPC). 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
It is expected that, following a small slowdown in the 
second half of 2004, GDP growth will pick up again 
as from the first half of 2005. Among the specific 
domestic factors which will affect economic 

developments in Belgium, the on-going direct tax 
reform will give a push to domestic demand by 
providing a temporary stim
ulus to consumption, 
especially in 2005 and 2006. Some expansionary 
effect is also expected from the 2006 local elections 
on local public investment, both in 2005 and the first 

half of 2006. Finally, wage moderation is expected to 
last because wage increases in the three main partner 
countries France, the Netherlands and Germany are 
anticipated to remain low. Employment is forecast to 
grow faster in 2005 an
d 2006, leading to some 
reduction in unemployment, which will however still 
remain high. 
Given the expected wage moderation, the slightly 
lower productivity growth in 2005 and 2006 as 

compared to 2004 will not
 put at risk the external 
competitiveness. This is 
expected to allow for an 
increase in the companies™ profit rates and a moderate 

recovery in investment. 
Public finances: one-off measures and the direct 
tax reform raise challenges for the future 
As regards public finances, 
in 2003 the government 
accounts benefited from a net amount of 1.5% of 

GDP in one-off measures, which contributed to a 
surplus of 0.4% of GDP. In 2004 the budget is 
affected by the following temporary measures: 1) the 

anticipation from 2004 to 2003 of a large part of the 
funding for the SNCB (0.4% of GDP); 2) sales in real 
estate of less than 0.1% of 
GDP; 3) the net impact of 
several changes in the withholding tax on earned 
income boosting tax proceeds by less than 0.1% of 

GDP; 4) the ﬁdeclaration libératoire uniqueﬂ would 
yield a net amount of 0.1% of GDP (compared to the 
0.3% of GDP expected initially by the government). 

Taken together these four measures are expected to 
have a positive impact on 
the 2004 budget of the 
order of 0.6% of GDP.  
Other than the temporary effects, the 2004 budget 
results are mainly affected by the economic recovery, 
which leads to higher increases in direct and indirect 
taxes than in the previous 
years, by the continued 
lowering in interest payments, and in the opposite 
direction, a sizable overrun in health care spending. 
For 2005, a deficit of 0.3% of GDP is estimated.  This

is partly explained by lower temporary measures 
stemming from the withholding taxes and sales of real 
estate (around 0.2% of GDP compared to previous 
0.6%). Other factors that 
impact on the 2005 budget 
are: on the negative side, lower direct taxes (by 0.2% 
of GDP) as a result of the tax reform; some higher 
public investment in the run-up to the 2006 local 

elections and higher interest payments than otherwise 
because of the planned assumption by the state of the 
debt of the public railway company SNCB. From the 

positive side there is a package of measures in the 
draft 2005 budget roughly estimated at around 0.4% 
of GDP
.For 2006, under the no-policy change assumption, the 
deficit is projected to increase to 0.5% of GDP, 
despite lower interest payments. This is mainly due to 

the phasing out of the one-off measures (0.2% of 
GDP) and the lower direct tax yields than in 2005 (by 
0.4% of GDP) under the last transition stage of the 

direct tax reform. As regards the debt-to-GDP ratio, it 
is expected to come belo
w 100% of GDP in 2004 for 
the first time since the early
 eighties and will continue 
to fall further in the whole forecast period. However, 

the decrease will be smaller in 2005 due to the 
planned assumption by the state of SNCB debt in the 
context of its restructuring. This is expected to raise 

the general government de
bt by EUR 7.4 billion or 
2.6% of GDP. The government intends to make this 
operation next year provided that: 1) it is decided at 

the EU level that this meas
ure only affects the debt, 
not the deficit; and 2) that the debt-to-GDP ratio 
remains below 100% after the operation which will be 
the case if our forecast materialises.  
Finally, following a decision from the European Court 
of Justice, the government may have to pay back the 

amounts collected for many years on some stock 
exchange operations, but the procedural details and 
the amount are not yet known, hence the impact of 

this decision is not included in this deficit estimate.

national accounts to adju

methodology. This statistical revision shows a 

somewhat different cyclical pattern and, as regards 
demand components, weaker consumption growth 
and stronger investment growth than was recorded 

earlier. The changes in our forecast reflect to a large 
extent the new historical data. 
In the first half of 2004, real GDP growth was strong 
and accelerating, reaching 3.5% y-o-y in the first and 
4.1% in the second quarter. The improvement of 
economic activity was mainly
 due to buoyant gross 
fixed capital formation which 
increased in real terms 
by 9.6% y-o-y in the first 
and by 12.8% in the second 
quarter. Household consumption was robust, but 

decelerating against the backdrop of falling real 
disposable income and rising unemployment. Public 
consumption declined, reflecting the consequences of 

fiscal consolidation. The external sector was buoyant. 
Growth of exports strengthen
ed to 23.1% y-o-y in the 
second quarter and growth of imports accelerated to 

24.7%. The increase in foreign trade volumes in the 
second quarter was mainly
 due to the elimination of 
the remaining trade ba
rriers with the EU-15. 
Growth prospects 
The immediate outlook for the Czech economy is for 
solid economic growth for the 
rest of 2004, leading to 
an annual growth rate of 3.8%. Investment is expected 
to be the main driving force. Public consumption and 

foreign trade should have 
a negative contribution to 
GDP growth. 
GDP growth in 2005 will remain strong at 3.8%, 
accelerating further to 4% in 2006, supported by the 
external sector. Final domestic demand will stay 

robust. In particular, invest
ment should continue to 
expand strongly, though at a slower pace than before. 
InflationAfter several months of falling prices in 2003, 
inflation picked up in 2004 against the backdrop of an 

increase in indirect taxes and high oil prices. After 
around two years, this took inflation back into the 
target band of 2.2-4.2% in
 September 2004. With 
increasing signs of cost push inflation, the Czech 
monetary authorities hiked the base rate in two steps 

by a total of 50 basis points. Forecasting a further rise 
in prices in the remainder of the year, average 
inflation in 2004 is estimate
d to be 2.8%. Inflation is 
projected to stay above 3% in 2005 as high oil prices 
will translate into higher cost
s and the negative output 
gap will slowly close. Inflation for 2006 is estimated 

at 2.9% in line with the medium term monetary policy 
target. Labour market 
The labour market is slow to react to the pick-up in 
economic activity due to st
ructural rigidities. This 
together with the ongo
ing adjustments of the 
industrial sector let the trend of decreasing 
employment continue in 2004
 and 2005. A reversal is 
expected only in 2006. 
The unemployment rate is 
forecast to rise to 8.3% this year and to fall slightly 
thereafter against the backdrop of a strong economic 

performance. 
Current account 
The developments in 2004 were characterised by 
increasing deficits in the 
income balance, mainly due 
to high repatriated profits linked to previous FDI 
inflows. However, the overall structure of the current 
account appears healthy, with a slightly declining 

deficit in the trade balance and an increasing surplus 
in the service balance. This
 suggests that there is no 
major problem of international competitiveness for 

the Czech economy. The trade balance deficit is 
expected to further decrease to 2.4% of GDP in 2004 
from 2.7% of GDP in 2003, while the current account 

deficit is projected to be 6.1% of GDP, almost the 
same as in 2003. The trade balance deficit is projected 
to remain at 2.4% of GDP in 2005, mainly due to high

GDP in 2006. The surplus in the service balance is 
expected to slightly rise. The current account deficit 

declines to 5.7% of GDP in 2006 as outflows of 
repatriated profits will be increasing. 
Public finances 
As a result of stronger growth, the general 
government deficit in 2004 is
 likely to be lower than 
expected, decreasing to 4.8% of GDP. Gross debt is 
foreseen to be unchanged compared with 2003, at 
37.8% of GDP. The 2005 state budget deficit as 
approved by the Parliament is in line with the fiscal 
consolidation path set 
in the May convergence 
programme. As economic growth is expected to be 
strong, the general government deficit is forecast to 
diminish further in 2005, albeit slowly, to 4.7% of 
GDP. If the expenditure ceili
ngs of individual budget 
lines are applied prudently, the authorities could even 
over-achieve this target. 
Continued strong GDP growth should further 
facilitate the process of fiscal 
consolidation in the 
election year 2006, but im
portant expenditure cuts, 
particularly regarding gove
rnment consumption, still 
need to be agreed upon. Therefore, the expenditure 
ceilings for 2006 are not tak
en into account and the 
2006 deficit is projected 
to be 4.3% of GDP. If 
expenditure ceilings were fu
lly applied, the deficit 
target of 3.8% of GDP fores
een in the convergence 
programme is in reach. Gross public debt is expected 
to increase from 39.4% of 
GDP in 2005 to 40.6% of 
GDP in 2006.

43433.Denmark
 Consumption-led recovery on track  
- 44 - 
The situation in 2004 
The recovery of economic activ
ity in Denmark, which 
started in the second half 
of 2003, has continued in 
2004. Exports expa
nded unexpectedly 
strongly in the 
first half of the year, but GDP growth remains driven 
mainly by domestic dema
nd, in particular private 
consumption. Household spending has been boosted 

by substantial increases in
 real disposable incomes 
due to direct and indirect tax cuts, as well as the 
suspension in 2004
 and 2005 of the contributions to a 
mandatory pension savings scheme. Car sales have 
rebounded strongly after 
the fall in 2003, and the 
robust increases in car sales in 2004 has contributed to 
the strength of private cons
umption. The target for 
real public consumption growth set by the 

government for 2003 was exceeded. However, the 
instruments applied by the government to limit local 
government spending are becoming more binding and 

public consumption is set to grow only modestly in 
2004. Investment growth accelerated in the second 
quarter, in particular in 
equipment investment, and 
industry confidence indicat
ors point to continued 
expansion. After a hesitant first quarter, exports grew 
robustly in the second quarter as foreign demand 

increased.  
The present trends are expected to continue during the 
rest of the year. Backed by strong consumer 
confidence, consumption is expected to accelerate 

further to reach its highest growth rate since 1994, as 
the income tax cuts come 
through into take-home pay. 
As imports should increase robustly, the growth 
contribution of net exports is 
expected to be negative.  
Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
Continuing the upswing fr
om 2004, domestic demand 
should lead to GDP growth of 2½%, slightly higher 
than in 2004. Private consumption is expected to 

remain buoyant, albeit growing by marginally less 
than in 2004. Th
e suspension of the special pension 
savings contributions will again free funds for 

consumption. However, somewhat higher inflation 
reduces real disposable income and could marginally 
dampen consumption growth. Investment is set to 

accelerate as foreign demand remains high and 
capacity utilisation increases. Denmark™s export markets are foreseen to grow 
robustly in 2005, albeit slightly less than in 2004. 
Danish exports are set to
 grow less than export 
markets, thus losing ma
rket shares throughout the 
forecast period. A loss of market shares in an upswing 
is a recurrent phenomenon in Denmark and is linked 
to the composition of exports. Moreover, relatively 

high wage increases in recent years have put pressure 
on competitiveness. On this basis, Denmark™s exports 
are expected to grow by so
me 5¼% in 2005, with a 
slight negative growth contribution from net exports. 
In 2006, the stimulative effect of the March 2004 
fiscal package is reduced as the special pension 
saving scheme (1% of gross
 income) is reinstated. 
Private consumption growth is thus dampened. 
Exports are expected to grow at a fairly robust, albeit 
declining, pace. Import growth decelerates due to 

lower domestic demand and the contribution to 
growth from net exports turns 
positive. On this basis, 
GDP growth is expected to be 2%, around the rate 
assessed to be sustainable in the medium term. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
After weakening substantially 
in 2003, with markedly 
falling employment and with
 unemployment rising to 
around 6%, the labour market started to improve in 
the first half of 2004. Employment increased but, as 
the labour force also increased, unemployment 

remained broadly unchanged. In view of the expected 
strength of domestic demand in the second half of the 
year, it is expected that th
e labour market will turn 
and unemployment will start to fall. The improvement 
in the labour market is expe
cted to continue through 
out the forecast period, with unemployment reaching 

around 5% in 2006.

Wage growth has been higher in Denmark than in the 
euro area in recent years. In the context of a still-weak 
labour market, private sector wage growth decelerated 

in the first half of 2004
. Over the forecast period, 
wage growth is expected to be some 3¼%, rising 
moderately as the labour market tightens towards the 

end of the period.  
Consumer price inflation ha
s been subdued in 2004, 
with average HICP inflatio
n set to be 1.1%. The 
dampened inflation is due to lower import prices, 

reductions in excise duties and decelerating wage 
growth. In 2005, inflation is
 set to increase somewhat 
as the effects of the reduction in excise duties 
disappears and import prices are expected to be 
higher, in part due to higher oil prices. 
Public finances  
Public finances are set to remain sound over the 
forecast period. A surplus of 1% of GDP in 2004 is 
expected to increase to around 1½% of GDP in 2005 

and 2006. This improvement 
is due to lower labour-
market related expenditure, normalised revenues from 
the pension fund yield ta
x, but also substantially 
increased oil-related revenues from North Sea oil 
activities, as well as from the higher oil prices. 
Following a decision by Euro
stat in March 2004, the 
surplus of the supplementary labour market pension 
(ATP) has been reclassified
 outside the government 
sector. This reduces the general government balance 
in Denmark by around 1 percentage point of GDP. 
This statistical change is of no consequence for the 

longer-term sustainability of public finances.

45454.Germany
 Gradual shift from external to domestic demand  
- 46 - 
The economy in 2004 
In the first half of 2004, Germany™s economy grew at 
a solid pace, thus putting a long stagnation to an end. 
Quarterly growth rates of 0.4% in the first and 0.5% 

in the second quarter, albe
it low in comparison with 
those of other EU countries, have been the strongest 
in three years.  
The upswing is the result of booming export demand 
in particular for investment goods for which Germany 
continues to enjoy a st
rong competitive position. 
From the standard pattern for recovery in Germany, 
strong exports should have been transmitted relatively 
quickly into a turnaround in domestic demand. This 

has not occurred. Domestic demand fell strongly in 
the first quarter (-0.8%) and continued to contract in 
the second quarte
r, albeit slightly. 
Most disappointing has been the performance of 
equipment investment, which 
is the more remarkable 
because practically the entire additional income 
resulting from the recent upswing has occurred as 

higher profits amidst s
tagnant labour compensation. 
Moreover investment volumes are one-fifth below 
their peak levels of 2000 an
d capacity utilisation rates 
have meanwhile returned to their long-term average. 
Despite a rather favoura
ble current situation, 
companies remain apparen
tly sceptical about the 
duration of the upswing, havi
ng been disappointed in 
their optimism for the previous three years. Rising oil 
prices and, to a lesser extent, the strong euro are likely 

to play a role in this context. Also, private 
consumption remained stagnant. Demand is suffering 
from very low wage increases (the mirror image of 
falling unit labour costs) and a still ongoing drop in 
employment. Only the tax 
reduction at the beginning 
of 2004 compensated for the falling gross real wages 
and kept net wages sligh
tly positive. However, an 
increase in the savings rate (not least driven by 

uncertainty related to labour market reforms) kept real 
consumption from increasing.  
Prospects 
Since the upswing seen in the 
first half of the year is 
exclusively based on global developments, it remains 

fragile. As the external impulse wears off due to less 
buoyant export growth combined with a stronger 
import demand, the overall growth rate might soften 
somewhat. Nevertheless there are first signs that at 
long last a spill-over into the domestic economy will 

take place, leading to a gradual shift from the external 
to a domestic growth c
ontribution. Early indicators 
are a rise in investment goo
ds sales, a strong import 
increase, and encouraging retail sales.  
While an end to the decline 
of residential construction is not in sight, an increase in equipment investment 
volumes is likely. This increase should gradually 

strengthen as capacity constraints become more 
binding. Throughout the forecast period, companies 
should benefit from very low wage increases, as high 

unemployment and the weak labour market has left 
trade unions in a weak position. Private consumption 
should also start to rise. While wage increases will 

stay subdued, the fall in em
ployment should reverse 
as the recovery continues. Labour market reforms will 
do their part to lower the employment threshold and 

reduce de facto unemployment.  
As a major part of its ﬁAgenda 2010ﬂ reform 
programme, the federal gov
ernment passed legislation

cuts in social transfers in 2005 (so-called ﬁHartz IVﬂ 
package). As a consequence of tightening the social 
benefit eligibility criteria, more than 200 000 persons 

are estimated to be forced to register as unemployed 
in order to continue receiving social benefits. Thus the 
surge in unemployment in the table below occurs as a 

statistical effect due to the systems change. At the 
same time, it can be expected that the introduction of 
the Hartz-measures in Ja
nuary 2005 will quickly 
dispel much of the uncertainty even of large parts of 
the population that are not 
immediately concerned by 
the reforms. The savings rate is therefore projected to 
fall throughout the forecast period.  
Government consumption in the next two years will 
provide no growth contribution due to the tight fiscal 

situation, although the 
composition of growth will 
become much more tax-fri
endly than in 2004.  
Even though the assumption underlying the forecast is 
a complete replacement of the net foreign contribution 

with domestic investment and consumption demand, 
the growth profile should sh
ow neither a significant 
acceleration nor deceleration. The seeming slowdown 

in projected GDP growth from 
close to 2% in 2004 to 
values slightly above 1½
% in 2005 and 2006 is 
almost entirely the result of changing calendar factors, 

which add some ½ pp to growth in the current leap 
year and subtract ¼ pp in each of the following years.  
The main downside risk to the forecast can be seen in 
higher oil prices and a parallel strong slowdown in the 

world economy. On the upside, the Hartz-reforms 
leave Germany with a more flexible labour market 
and improve the economi
c growth potential. The 
dynamics of this are, however, hard to gauge and 
depend both on successful implementation and 

whether it is followed by further reforms.  
As a consequence of low wage growth, inflation will 
remain moderate. After a relatively strong HICP 
increase in the current year (as a result of high oil 

prices and the statistical effect of medical co-
payments), inflation should return to very low levels 
of 1¼ % annually. 
Public finances  
The general government deficit is projected to reach 
3.9% of GDP in 2004, thus continuing its steady rise 
since 2001. This is
 mainly due to a 
projected fall in 
government revenues by 0.5% in 2004. One important 
reason is the large reductio
n in income taxes rates 
equalling 0.7% of GDP that was implemented at the 
beginning of 2004 as part of the tax relief laws passed 

in 2000. This was only partly counterfinanced by a 
broadening of the tax base
. In addition, lacklustre 
domestic demand has kept consumption tax revenues 

low. Tax shortfalls are further accelerated by low 
mineral oil taxes in the wake
 of rising oil prices and 
the fact that the increase in the tobacco tax rate in 

March 2004 did not translate into higher revenues so 
far. A tax amnesty, aimed at repatriating savings 
currently deposited undeclared abroad, is projected to 
contribute less than planned to government revenues.  
General government expenditures are projected to 
remain almost unchanged 
in nominal terms. The 
health sector reforms introdu
ced in the beginning of 
2004 substantially reduced government spending on 
health care, which enables the statutory health 

insurance providers to run a surplus this year, 
reducing the debt they have accumulated over the last 
years. Also, pension transfer
s have been cut. However 
the ongoing worsening of the labour market has led to 
rising expenditures on transfers such as 
unemployment and social assistance.  
In cyclically-adjusted terms, the deficit is expected to 
widen from 3.0% of GDP in 2003 to 3.4% of GDP in 
2004. However, with the output gap closing, this is 
mainly the result of the ta
x-unfriendly composition of 
growth, rather than discretionary loosening.  
Deficit above 3% of GDP in 2005 
In 2005, the German general government deficit is 
projected to fall to 3.4% of GDP, on unchanged 
policies, which would imply a fourth consecutive 
breach of the 3% of GDP ceiling. General government 
revenue is expected to grow by almost 2% despite the 

implementation of the last stage of the tax relief law 
from the year 2000, not least because rising profits 
will lead to higher corpor
ate taxes. In addition, the 
introduction of a road toll 
is expected to add to 
revenues.  
Expenditures are expected to
 rise only slightly, 
though by more than in 
2004. The dampening effect 
of the health sector reforms will abate. Whether 
statutory health insurers w
ill continue to run surpluses 
to reduce their accumulated debt, may not least 

depend  on  political  pressure  on  them  to  lower  the  
4747Chapter 3   Member States, Germany
- 48 - 
contribution rates. The Hartz IV reforms should 
reduce social spending, t
hough initially this may be 
mitigated by administrative 
frictions in the transition 
to the new system.  
In cyclically-adjusted terms, the deficit is expected to 
narrow by 0.5 percentage points to 2.9% of GDP in 
2005, not least as the composition of GDP growth is 

projected to become more tax-friendly. The 
mainbudgetary risks for 2005
 would be a continuing 
stagnation of private consum
ption translating into tax 
shortfalls and the labour 
market developing more 
unfavourably than projected. 
The general government deficit is projected to fall 
below 3% of GDP in 2006 
by a narrow margin. 
Growing private consumption is expected to bolster 
tax revenues, while no further tax cuts are planned. 

Again, the tax revenue effects from the growth 
composition shifting to domestic demand will be 
mechanically reflected in a reduction of the 
cyclically-adjusted deficit. Expenditure growth is 
expected to accelerate, though yet moderately. A 
recovering labour market in combination with the 
legislated labour market reforms are expected to show 

effect on social transfers.  
Nonetheless, the expenditure restraint of 2004 and 
2005 comprised in part one-time measures, like 
pension and public sector wage freezes, and without 

further structural measures, health care spending may 
return to pre-2004 high growth rates. Thus, in order to 
bring the public finances on 
a sustainable path, further 
long-term consolidation meas
ures on the expenditure 
side are needed. Government debt is expected to 

continue rising until 2006, s
taying considerably above 
the reference value of 60% of GDP.

485.Estonia
 Buoyant exports and lively domestic demand set to continue 
- 49 - 
The situation in 2004 
GDP growth accelerated during the first six months of 
2004 to 6.3% year-on-year 
from an annual growth 
rate of 5.1% in 2003. Main dri
vers of growth in 2004 
are net exports, supported by good results in foreign 
tourism, and buoyant domestic demand. Investment 
grew by 6.1 % in the first half of this year, regaining 

strength since last year. C
onstruction did particularly 
well on the back of a strong pre-accession housing 
boom that also boosted 
credit demand by over 30%. 
During the second quarter
, CPI inflation picked up 
strongly, to rates around 4%, reflecting hikes in excise 
taxes and some administrative prices that were 
induced by EU accession. Since July, these one-off 
effects have started to abate and inflation is 

moderating again. Labour market conditions continue 
to improve. The unemployment rate declined to 9.1% 
of the labour force in the 2nd quarter, while 

employment is constantly in
creasing from a low level. 
The planned general government surplus for 2004 was 
revised downwards to 0.3% of GDP, from 0.7%, with 

a supplementary budget to the tune of 0.4% of GDP. 
On the whole, the situation in 2004 is marked by 
various EU accession effects, most of which can be 

expected to be temporary.  
Prospects for 2004 and 2005  
EU accession not only affected prices, but also 
triggered a housing boom supporting strong 
construction activity, combin
ed with buoyant credit 
expansion. Household demand was reinforced by 
inventory build-up in the months prior to 1 May 2004. 
It also changes the composition of government 
revenues, and inflates both
 revenue and expenditure 
ratios. Therefore, 2004 ma
y display some irregular 
economic developments in response to this 

‚exogenous shock™. Given the strong base from the 
first two quarters, real GDP is expected to grow by 
5.9% this year, and to further accelerate over the 

forecast horizon. With exports picking up strongly, 
and government consumption declining, growth 
should become somewhat more balanced. The fiscal 

stimulus from the reduction 
of the government surplus 
by roughly 2.5% of GDP this 
year, and the inflow of 
EU transfers will fuel gr
owth well into 2005-2006. 
Investment is expected to remain strong, not least due 
to public infrastructure spending and smooth 

absorption of EU transf
ers since May. Inflation should peak at 3.5% in 2005 and abate gradually 
thereafter. Oil prices remain a risk factor to the 

inflation forecast, with a first petrol price increase in 
October.  Labour market, costs and prices 
The strong growth performance over recent years 
continues to translate both 
into sustained employment 
gains and lower unemployment. Also, regional 
disparities in the labour market are starting to decline. 
These trends are forecast to prevail over the forecast 

period. The persisting skills
 mismatch will prevent a 
faster improvement in la
bour market conditions, and 
could at some point even lead to shortages of 

qualified labour, which are likely to be reinforced by 
strong demand for Estonian
 workers in neighbouring 
EU countries. As a result of higher inflation coupled 
with considerable wage moderation, real wages are 
increasing more slowly in 
2004 than in
 2003. Over 
the forecast period, declining real unit labour costs are 
expected to further impr
ove Estonia™s competitive 
position.  Balance of payments 
External trade data are less reliable at present, 
following the methodologi
cal changes in computation 
that were required upon EU accession. Even if the 
levels and growth rates are uncertain, Estonia™s trade 

balance has somewhat improved through a strong 
pick-up in exports that wa
s caused by the rebound of 
external demand, both from the EU and beyond. The

increased, thanks to a g
ood foreign tourism season. 
On the current account, these overall positive 
developments are largely offset by a negative income 

balance which reflects primarily repatriated profits 
(often in the form of reinvested earnings which come 
back on the capital account as FDI), but also large 

inter-banking operations between the dominating 
Scandinavian banks and their Estonian branches. On 
the capital account, increasing outward foreign direct 

investment of Estonian companies, primarily into the 
Baltic neighbour states is offsetting part of the 
incoming FDI. Overall, 
the capital account is 
expected to remain in surplus, which along with 
sizeable FDI and portfolio inflows will help to better 

balance the external account of Estonia in the medium 
term. On the whole, the decline of the high current 
account deficit risks being delayed beyond 2004. The 

deficit is forecast to remain around 13% of GDP in 
2004, before starting to come
 down to a level around 
10% of GDP at the end of the forecast period. 
Public finance 
A strong fiscal stimulus is supporting growth, since 
the revised surplus of 3.1% 
of GDP in 2003 is being 
reduced to an expected 0.5% this year. In the medium 

term, the Estonian government is targeting balanced 
budgets. However, prudent budget assumptions and 
continuing improvements 
in tax collectio
n are likely to lead to modest surpluses also in 2005 and 2006. 
Certain local governments
 (notably the city of 
Tallinn) continue to report considerable deficits, albeit 

on a declining trend, since some are reaching their 
legal borrowing limits. A 
supplementary 2004 budget 
to the tune of 0.4% of GDP was presented to 
Parliament in September. It will compensate local 
governments for shortfalls in
 income tax shares that 
occurred as a consequence of the ongoing tax reform. 
The 2005 budget was adopted by the government in 
September, and foresees the implementation of a cut 

in the flat tax rate for both corporate and personal 
income tax by 2 percentage points.

506.Greece 
 Challenges in the post-Olympic Games™ period 
- 51 - 
Economic activity in 2004  
Although decelerating with 
respect to the previous 
years, economic activity remained buoyant in 2004, 
with real GDP growth estimated at 3.8%, well above 

the the euro area average. Growth was driven by 
domestic demand, in particular government 
consumption, linked to the Olympic Games. 

However, investment growth slowed down 
significantly compared with 2003, since the bulk of 
construction investment 
related to the Olympic 
Games was fully realised by June 2004. Yet, for the 
year as a whole, gross fixed capital formation was a 
significant contributor 
to GDP growth. Despite 
supportive monetary conditions, private consumption 
is expected to decelerate somewhat relative to the 

previous year, as real disposable income growth in 
2004 seems to slow dow
n. Owing to the sharp 
acceleration of exports of services and to an increase 

in the net current transfer
s from the rest of the world, 
the current account deficit s
eems to have narrowed in 
2004. Exports of goods deteriorated due to substantial 

competitiveness losses. In parallel, imports of goods, 
in particular equipment, increased, pushed up by 
dynamic investment.  
Employment growth was strong, following booming 
economic activity, and helped reducing the 
unemployment rate. Yet, the unemployement rate in 
Greece remained among the highest in the EU. 

Compensation per head 
increased due to the 
implementation of the 2004 wage agreement in the 
private sector, while consumer prices are expected to 
decline to 2.9% in 2004
 from 3.5% in 2003. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
As the Olympic Games related investments cease and 
the government implements
 significant, but likely 
insufficient budgetary adjustments, domestic demand 

is expected to decelerate. Nevertheless the domestic 
sector will continue being the main driving force of 
GDP growth. Real GDP growth should resume to a 

slightly above potential rate, reaching 3.3% in both 
2005 and 2006. On the back of rising indebtedness 
and expectations for a deceleration of real disposable 
income, private consumption is expected to slow 
down. Public consumption is expected to sharply 

decelerate as the government undertakes measures to 
reduce the excessive deficit. Since the Olympic 
Games related investments will not be recurring in 

2005, growth of fixed capital formation is expected to 
slow down, albeit still outpacing the euro area 
average.  
The current account deficit is projected to decline in 
2005 and in 2006, since exports of goods and services 
are expected to increase within the context of a global 
economic recovery. On the other hand, the growth 

rate of imports of goods should slow down due to the 
projected deceleration of investment. As a result, the 
negative contribution of the external sector should 

narrow in 2005 and be 
positive in 2006.  
Costs and prices   
The consumer price index (national definition) is 
expected to increase by 2.8% in 2005 and by 2.6% in 
2006. According to the new two-year wage agreement 
concluded on 13 May 2004, employees will receive a 
nominal pay rise of 6.0% 
in 2004 and 5.5% in 2005. 
This is well above average 
inflation. Unit labour costs 
for the whole economy are expected to decelerate 
during the forecast period. Still the growth of unit 

labour costs in Greece will remain well above the 
euro area average. This may adversely affect 
competitiveness, since real wage growth will outpace 

productivity growth, which 
is projected at 2.3% and 
2.2% in 2005 and 2006 respectively.  
Public finances  
The EDP notification of September 2004 showed that, 
in spite of strong growth, Greece has been in 

excessive deficit since 2000. After reaching 4.6% of 
GDP in 2003, the deficit is expected to further

increase in 2004 to 5.5% of GDP. Although partly 
attributable to some non-recurrent factors (e.g. 
organisation of the Olympi
c Games, electoral cycle), 
rising deficits clearly point 
to a lack of control over 
primary spending (wages, pensions and social 
transfers, operational spending), while budget 

revenues, including revenues from EU grants, seem to 
fall short of projections. The debt ratio is expected to 
significantly increase in 2004
 (112.1% of GDP), up 
from 109.9% in 2003. Based on a rather optimistic 
macroeconomic scenario, the 2005 draft State budget 
targets a significant reduction in the general 
government deficit, from 5.3% of GDP in 2004 (EDP 
notification) to 2.8%, thus falling just below the 3% 

threshold as required
 in the EDP Council 
recommendation under Art.10
4(7). This improvement 
in the general government deficit by 2.5 pp (2.2 pp 

increase in primary surplus and 0.3 pp decline in 
interest payments) does not imply a tightening in 
fiscal policy stance as it stems mostly from the one-
off expenditures related to the Olympic Games in 
2004 and from expected buoyant revenues, in 
particular from social contributions. According to the 

Commission Autumn 2004 forecasts, which are based 
on a more realistic scenario, the general government 
deficit is projected to fall by 1.9 pp and attain at 3.6% 

of GDP in 2005. This should be the result of a 1.6 pp 
increase in the primary surplus and a 0.3 pp decline in 
interest payments. Theref
ore the budgetary plans of 
the government appear insufficient to bring the 
nominal deficit below the 3% threshold. Under the 
assumption of unchanged policies a deficit of 3.0% of 
GDP is projected for 2006. The primary balance is set 
to improve by 0.5 pp in 
that year. The general 
government debt ratio is 
expected to still decline at a 
very slow pace during the forecasting period. In 2005, 
the debt ratio is projected to reach 111,9% of GDP 

and 110.2% in 2006.

527.Spain
 Losing competitiveness 
- 53 - 
Economic developments in 2004 
GDP growth in 2003 was recently revised upwards by 
0.1 of a percentage point to 2.5%, with private 
consumption and investment in dwellings as the main 

driving forces. In contrast, the external sector posted a 
negative contribution to GDP growth of 0.8 
percentage points. The first two quarters of 2004 offer 

a similar picture, with growth based on strong 
domestic demand, while the external sector recorded a 
growing negative contribution.  
Private consumption, sustained by sound employment 
growth, is currently keeping its dynamism and even 
gaining some momentum compared with the previous 

year. Construction continues 
to grow slightly above 
4% and is expected to remain robust during the 
second half of 2004. Invest
ment in equipment was 
rather sluggish in the first two quarters and is 
expected to show a very limited recovery in the rest of 
the current year due to 
the still uncertain economic 
outlook. Overall, domestic demand should accelerate 
in 2004, sustained by private consumption 
expenditure and investment in dwellings. 
The strength of domestic demand continues to boost 
imports of goods and serv
ices in 2004 whereas 
exports growth is less dynamic due to poor external 
market conditions and competitiveness losses 

stemming mainly from cumulated inflation and 
productivity differentials. As a result, the external 
sector is expected to register a negative contribution 

slightly above 1%. All in all, for 2004 as a whole, 
GDP is foreseen to grow by 2.6%, only 0.1 
percentage point more than in 2003. These figures 
present an unbalanced growth scenario based on  
growing household indebtedness linked to the boom 
in residential construction.
 In addition, the high 
negative contribution of 
the external sector may 
reveal some weaknesses in the external 
competitiveness, which c
ould challenge economic 
performance in the medium term.  
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Due to still sound empl
oyment growth and easy 
monetary conditions, growth in 2005 will continue to 
be based on buoyant domestic demand, along with a 
broadly stable negative external contribution to GDP 
growth. The expected moderation of private 
consumption stems from the sizeable households™ 
indebtedness while the still 
high inflationary pressures 
and the worsening in the terms of trade may also 
negatively affect consumers™ purchasing capacity. 

Construction is also foreseen
 to register a moderate 
deceleration that should be offset by a mild pick-up in 
investment in equipment. The latter, although still 

behaving timidly, would be 
the main factor explaining 
the anticipated acceleration in gross fixed capital 
formation. Conversely, still uncertain prospects for 

the international economic setting would be behind 
the modest acceleration of exports, whereas the strong 
final demand would keep feeding imports growth well 

above exports. Accordingly, GDP growth would 
remain barely changed with respect to the previous 
year at 2.6%.  
The year 2006 is projected to record a broadly similar 
performance, with GDP accelerating marginally to 
2.7%, still below potential. Growth composition is 
expected to remain unbalanced, based on the strength

of domestic demand, while the negative external 
contribution would remain close to a bleak 1%. 
Although still recordin
g healthy growth rates, 
households™ indebtedness is expected to take its toll 
by constraining private consumption developments. 
Construction is expected to further decelerate, partly 

due to tighter monetary conditions, while investment 
should accelerate only slightly in line with the 
moderate recovery of exports. 
Labour market  
Employment growth should re
sume at close to 2% in 
terms of full-time equivalent jobs during the whole 
forecast period. Job creation is expected to be 

concentrated in sectors wh
ere productivity is low, 
mainly construction and some market services. In 
contrast, job losses, although at a lower pace, will 

continue in manufacturing activities in 2004 and 
2005. This trend is expected to revert at the end of the 
forecast period. The employment rate is foreseen to 

follow an upward trend and increase by at around two 
percentage points over the forecast period, ending at 
slightly above 63% (EUROSTAT definition). 
Notwithstanding the envisage
d increase in the active 
population by 2% throughout the forecast horizon, 
mainly due to still-high immigration flows and female 
participation, the expected employment growth 

should help reduce the unemployment rate below 11% 
in 2005 (EUROSTAT definition). Nevertheless, the 
decreasing path of unemployment reduction should be 

very flat and the unemployment rate should remain 
well above 10% at the end of the forecast period.  
Costs and prices 
Despite the moderation in unprocessed food prices, 
the oil price hikes in the s
econd and third quarters of 
the year pushed up head
line inflation significantly. As 
a result, HICP is forecast to grow slightly above 3% 

on average in 2004, barely changed compared to the 
previous year.
Inflation is expected to moderate from the second 
quarter of 2005. On average, HICP inflation should 

ease marginally to 2.9% in
 2005 and fall further to 
2.5% in 2006. Despite this deceleration in terms of 
HICP, inflationary pressures in the Spanish economy 

will persist during the projection period. Leaving 
aside energy components, prices of imported goods 
show a more moderate behaviour than domestically 
produced goods. Thus, the GDP deflator should grow 
well above the HICP. While this gap is expected to be 
around 0.7 percentage points in 2004, it is foreseen to 

widen to almost 1% in 2006.  
Compensation per head should decelerate in 2004. 
However, the rise in inflation in 2004 will accelerate 
wage increases through indexation provisions in 2005. In the absence of inflatio
nary surprises in 2005, the 
effect of indexation clauses in 2006 should be more 
moderate. Accordingly, in 2006, compensation of 

employees per head is projected to decelerate to some 
3.6%. This wage behaviour, coupled with sluggish 
apparent labour productivity, should imply a rise in 
unit labour costs in 2005 and lead to a moderation by 
the end of the projection period.  
External sector 
The growing trade deficit in goods reflects both 
strong domestic demand growth relative to weak 
external markets and the ongo
ing worsening in cost 
competitiveness. This def
icit will be only partially 
offset by the services balan
ce. The traditional surplus recorded by services is expected to narrow gradually 
during the forecasting period, mainly due to the 

subdued behaviour of tourism. Accordingly, the 
current account deficit is fo
reseen to wi
den further over the forecast horizon, raising concerns about its 

sustainability.  
The increasing presence of Spanish firms overseas, 
coupled with falling flows of foreign direct 
investment, will tend to moderate the traditional 

deficit of the balance of pr
imary incomes during the 
forecast period. In contrast, the high immigrant flows 
will keep the deficit of net 
current transfers broadly 
stable.  As a result, the current account balance and 
the net lending position of the economy are envisaged 

to deteriorate steadily to nearly 5% and 4%, 
respectively. These numbers
 reveal a competitiveness 
loss that stems from the cu
mulated positiv
e inflation differentials and low prod
uctivity growth and scant 
product differentiation. 
Public finances 
In 2003, despite personal income tax cuts, the general 
government balance achieved a better result than 

expected, supported by robust indirect tax collection 
and social security contributions, registering a surplus 
of 0.4% of GDP.  
54Chapter 3 Member States, SpainRevenues in 2004 remain buoyant because of the 
relatively strong domestic demand and robust 
employment growth. However, some one-off 

measures adopted by the 
new government
 in office 
since March 2004 that do 
not involve revisions for 
past years will affect the general government balance 

in the current year. Among them, the assumption of 
the Railway Network Company™s debt by the Central 
government will increase its deficit by 0.7% of GDP. 

Other minor adjustments correspond to the inclusion 
of RTVE (public television) in the general 
government sector in 2004, which raises the State 
deficit by 0.08% of GDP and a credit granted to 
Argentina amounting to 0.03% of GDP. Overall, the 

initially planned balanced budget for the general 
government sector in 2004 is 
now expected to turn to 
a deficit of 0.5% of GDP. 
In the budget for 2005, the 
government targets a small 
surplus of 0.2% of GDP for 
the consolidated balance 
of the State and the social security system. When 

including the territorial 
governments, the general 
government surplus is reduced to 0.1% of GDP.  
The new draft budget plans to increase social 
protection and expenditure
 in infrastructures and 
R&D and innovation activities, which are considered 

to be the main spending areas. On the revenues side, 
indirect and direct taxes, as well as social security 
contributions are expected to remain buoyant, 

supported by strong job cr
eation and firms™ higher 
profits in 2005. The official target, however, might be 
based on optimistic growth assumptions. Therefore, a 

more realistic macroeconomic scenario would yield a 
marginal deficit of 0.1% of GDP.  
Under a no-policy change assumption, 2006 could be 
close to a balanced budget for the general government 
as a whole. This projection is subject to a high degree 
of uncertainty and pressures for higher social 

expenditure might change th
is scenario. Accordingly, 
after deteriorating in 200
4, the primary surplus is 
projected to remain broadly stable at around 2% in 

2005 and 2006. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
continue to decline during the forecast period, falling 
below 50% of GDP already in 2004 and to around 

43% of GDP by end-2006.

Sound growth and limited fiscal efforts

The situation in 2004  
The economic recovery continued in the first half of 
2004, when real GDP growth exceeded 3% in 
annualised terms, after 2.5% in the second half of 

2003. This was the stronge
st performance in the last 
four years. Contrary to wh
at was observed in the euro 
area as a whole, the French recovery was supported 

by domestic demand, especially by private 
consumption. In a context of protracted weakness of 
household™s gross disposable income, the dynamism 

of consumption was driven by a large and unexpected 
decline in the saving ratio: after the implementation of 
reforms on pensions and healthcare, the latest 
consumer™s surveys suggest that households are less 
concerned by their current financial situation. The 

rebound on equity markets and the increase in 
housing prices may also have encouraged households 
to free up some savings. 
Nevertheless, the decline in 
the saving ratio occurred despite the ongoing increase 
in unemployment: the clear rebound of real GDP 
growth observed for one year has not yet triggered 

any improvement in th
e labour market, with 
employment growth remaining very weak in the first 
half of 2004 (see graph below). In a context of 

improving demand prospects, and of increasing profit 
margins, business investment accelerated significantly 
in the first half of this y
ear, contributing further to the 
economic rebound. The latter
 was limited by a 
significant drag from the external sector, which 
reflected the relative weakness of exports, especially 

compared to developments in some other euro area 
countries, and buoyant imports.  
Recent macroeconomic indicators suggest that 
economic activity is gradually decelerating. Notably, 
personal business expectations in the manufacturing 
industry have hardly improv
ed in the recent months. 
In such a context, and factoring in a rise in uncertainty 
linked to the sharp increase 
of oil prices, investment 
should be less buoyant in the 
second half of the year.  
Private consumption is likely to decelerate, also since 
the strong increase of the first half of the year was 
partly due to exceptional 
factors (energy consumption 
was particularly strong due to unusually bad weather 
conditions). Moreover, the short-term employment 
outlook does not augur well for consumption in the 
coming months: the latest surveys in the 
manufacturing and service sectors reveal that hiring 

intentions remain at a relativ
ely low level, suggesting 
that employment growth may not accelerate 
significantly before 2005.  
All in all, real GDP growth is projected to slow down 
to an annualised rate of le
ss than 2% in the second 
half of 2004. On average,
 real GDP growth in 2004 
would still post a clear acceleration compared to 

2003, when it reached only 0.5%. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Real GDP growth is forecast to diminish somewhat in 
2005 and 2006. Economic activity should be mainly 
driven by domestic demand, while the negative 

influence of net trade would gradually diminish. 
Private consumption is projected to increase more in 
line with households™ real disposable income, which 
would accelerate gradually in 2005 and 2006, due to 

the projected recovery in 
employment and wages. The 
savings ratio of households is still expected to edge

down marginally until next summer. This would 
reflect the introduction of ta
x exemptions on interest 
payments on consumer credits, and on inter-

generational financial transfer
s which are expected to 
encourage households to free up some savings. In 
total, private consumpti
on would increase by 1.7% 
and 2.1% in 2005 and 2006 re
spectively, after 2.4% in 
2004.  Investment is projected to remain relatively dynamic 
in the next two years. It 
should still be supported by 
favourable financing conditions, and by the 
introduction of new tax incentiv
es, notably cuts in the 
taxe professionnelle 
(a flat local tax on productive 
capital) on new capital expenditure. The gradual 

deceleration projected over the forecast period Œ from 
3.7% in 2005 to 3.4% in 2006 - would be triggered by 
a slight deterioration in demand expectations.  
After losing export market 
shares in 2003, mostly due 
to the appreciation of the exchange rate and to an 
unfavourable sectoral com
position of global growth 
(recession in the electronic and aeronautic sectors), 
exports volumes ar
e projected to increase more in line 
with export market growth over the next two years. 

This better performance would notably stem from an 
improvement of price comp
etitiveness. In such a 
context, and despite the projected dynamism of 

imports, related to the robu
stness of final demand, net 
trade would no longer exert a significant drag on real 
GDP growth in 2005 and 2006. 
Labour markets, costs and prices  
The current weakness of em
ployment growth, largely 
explained by the need for companies to improve their 
financial situation and uncertainties concerning the 

durability of the recovery, shou
ld come to an end in 
2005 and 2006. This would allow a substantial decline 
in the unemployment rate, from 9.9% of the labour 

force in 2004 to 9.5% in
 2006 (ILO definition). Such 
developments would be consistent with a gradual 
slowdown of labour produc
tivity, after the strong cyclical rebound of 2004. 
In a context of a still positive unemployment gap, 
wage moderation is expected to continue in 2005. 

Nevertheless, the harmonisation of the different levels 
of the minimum wage induced by the policies of 
reduction in working time to
 35 hours per week will 
support the increase in real wages in 2005. In 2006, 
wages should post a slight cyclical acceleration, in 
line with the improvement 
of the situation in the 
labour market. 
As a consequence of the moderation in unit labour 
costs and import prices, core inflation is projected to 
remain roughly constant in 2005. A modest increase is 
projected for 2006. Headline inflation should 

nevertheless decline somewh
at in 2005 due to the 
disappearance of the impact of past increases in 
tobacco prices (reducing th
e inflation rate by 0.5 
percentage point in 2005), which would more than 
compensate for the increase in energy prices.  
Government finances 
The general government deficit is expected to decline 
from 4.1% of GDP in 2003 to 3.7% of GDP in 2004. 
The decline of the deficit is favoured by the 
improvement of the macroeconomic situation, which 

will trigger additional fiscal revenues of about 0.3% 
of GDP compared to Budget plans. Moreover, 
discretionary measures on the tax side will contribute 

to a reduction in the def
icit by about 0.1% of GDP. 
The tax burden is nevertheless expected to decline 
marginally Œ from 43.8% of GDP to 43.6% of GDP, 

mostly due to the weakness of employment growth 
and its consequences for social contribution revenues. 
The ratio of general government expenditure to GDP 

is projected to decline from 54.7% of GDP to 54.2% 
of GDP. This assumes that the expenditure target in 
the State sector will be respected and that no further 

slippages will occur in the health and local authorities 
sectors, compared to those already acknowledged by 
the French authorities. 
It is worth noting that the projection for the 2004 
deficit is exactly the same 
as in Spring, when real 
GDP growth for 2004 was forecast not to exceed 
1.7%, as against 2.4% expected currently. This is due 
to the fact that, in the m
eantime, the 2003 deficit was 
revised upwards, tax cuts were implemented, and 
expenditures were not kept in line with plans. All in 
all, according to Commission calculations, the 

cyclically-adjusted deficit will improve by 0.3 
percentage point of GDP in 2004, as against 0.8 
percentage point initially co
mmitted by the French 
authorities. The general gove
rnment debt is expected 
to continue to increase from 63.7% of GDP in 2003 to 
64.9% of GDP in 2004. 
In 2005, the general governm
ent deficit is projected to 
decline further to 3.0% of GDP. This forecast 
assumes that expenditure plans included in the 
5757Chapter 3 Member States, France- 58 - 
Finance Law for 2005 will 
be respected, except for a 
slippage in health expenditure, which are projected to 
increase by 4.0%, as against 3.2% expected by the 

French authorities. Indeed, alth
ough the reform of the 
health insurance system adopted last Summer is likely 
to trigger substantial savings over time, the precise 

budgetary impact of some measures is uncertain. On 
the revenue side, the forecast incorporates one-off 
measures for a total amount of 0.5% of GDP. These 

revenues are related to the transfer to the social 
security sector of the responsibility for the payment of 
pensions to EDF employees. The macroeconomic and 
budgetary forecast for 2005 is consistent with an 
improvement in the cyclically-adjusted balance by 0.7 

percentage point of GDP, the largest part of which 
reflects however the impact of the one-off measures. 
The risks to this government deficit forecast for 2005 

are skewed to the upside.
 Beyond the uncertainties 
surrounding macroeconomic developments stemming 
notably from the recent incr
ease in oil prices, further 
expenditure slippage cannot be ruled out, notably in 
the health and local authorities
 sectors. Moreover, this 
forecast does not incorporate the cuts of taxes on 
energy announced by the Minister of Finance on 19 

October 2004. While it is no
t possible to quantify the 
impact of these measures at the current juncture, it 
cannot be excluded that it wo
uld be sufficient to bring 
the 2005 deficit forecast above 3% of GDP. 
In 2006, despite the fact that real GDP growth is 
expected to be close to its potential rate, the general 
government deficit is proj
ected to increas
e again to 
3.3% of GDP. This reflects the fact that the 
exceptional payments contributing to the deficit 
reduction in 2005 will va
nish in 2006, and that 
significant tax cuts are already planned for that year 
(0.2% of GDP). This projection is based on the 

assumption that real gove
rnment expenditures will 
increase by about 1¾ % in real terms, to be compared 
with a projection of 1.2% in the latest multi-annual 

budgetary projection of the French authorities.

 Adjusting to sustainable growth levels 
-59 
-Activity in 2004  
According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP 
increased by 4.1% on the year in the second quarter of 
2004, after expanding by 6.1% in the previous 

quarter. On the domestic side, economic activity has 
been mixed. While consumer demand grew only 
modestly by comparison with previous years, 

investment growth has been 
strong and, in particular, 
residential building activity c
ontinued to grow at high 
levels. On the external side, figures for the first half of 

2004 suggest a marked improvement in exports 
reflecting a more favourable 
trading environment. At 
the same time, imports have risen more slowly, 
resulting in a stronger growth contribution from net 
exports as compared to 2003. As regards the third 

quarter of 2004, the latest purchasing managers™ 
indices for manufacturing an
d services continued to 
report increased activity. Confidence indicators also 

generally point to an im
provement, although there 
have been some fluctuations in consumer sentiment.  
For the year as a whole, real GDP growth is expected 
to reach 5.2% in 2004, compared with 3.7% in 2003. 

While still impressive, the extraordinary growth 
performance of the second 
half of the 1990s, then 
mainly due to a favourable external environment and 
sizeable pool of available labour, is unlikely to be 
repeated. As net profit outflo
ws are projected to hold 
their normal upward trend, th
e corresponding growth 
rate in GNI terms is somewhat lower.  
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Growth of the economy is 
expected to stabilise close 
to the rate commonly thought 
to be sustainable in the 
medium term. Overall, GDP is projected to grow by 
4.8% and 5.0% in 2005 and 2006 respectively. On the 
domestic side, private consumption is underpinned 

into 2005 by healthy em
ployment growth, but somewhat lower consumer confidence is likely to act 
as some offset. In 2006
, private spending slightly accelerates as it is assumed to benefit from a modest 
fall in the savings rate, 
as funds in Special Savings 
Incentive Accounts (
SSIA
) reach maturity. By 
contrast, the contribution to growth of public 
consumption is subdued by virtue of further spending 
restraint. Investment in 
equipment should somewhat 
rebound over the forecast horizon, following a 
sustained period of weakness since 2001. However, as 

growth in housing completions is expected to taper 
off after double-digit growth in 2004, fixed 
investment should overall tend to record slower 

growth rates in 2005 and 
2006. As a result, overall 
domestic demand growth should be fairly stable. On 
the external side, the performance of the international 

economy and oil prices are the key medium-term 
risks.Labour market 
In 2004, employment growth is set to strengthen to 
2.4% on the year in response to improved economic 

conditions. However, in 
view of the expected 
economic activity and the cap on public sector 
employment, employment gains will be weaker in 

2005 and 2006. With a somewhat slower rate of 
expansion projected for the labour force, 
unemployment should remain
 just under 4½% in the 
forecast period, implying fairly tight labour market 
conditions.  Cost and prices 
In line with the available data for the first half of

Public finances 
The main measures implemented in the budget for 
2004 included a further re
duction of the growth rate 
of current discretionary expenditure, a return to 
positive growth in capital spending after a slowdown 
in 2003 and, on the revenue side, a modest increase in 
indirect taxes and a partial adjustment to inflation of 
the personal income tax system. Provided 

expenditures continue to be
 broadly in line with the 
budget and taking account of one-off receipts from 
strengthened tax enforcement and all other factors 
(including duties on buoy
ant capital transactions), the 
actual outturn of the gene
ral government deficit is 
forecast to reach around 0.2% of GDP. The deficit is 
projected to stabilise at around ½% of GDP in 2005 

and 2006. Given the non-indexed nature of the tax 
and social benefit systems, the no-policy change 
assumption for 2005 is made operational, in the 

absence of previously announced measures, by 
freezing average tax rates and adjusting social transfer 
payments by the forecast CPI inflation rate (with a 
small top-up). Government debt is projected to 
stabilise at just under one-third of GDP.

 Muted and lagged response to the buoyant global environment 
- 61 - 
The economy in 2004 
Following the meagre perfo
rmance in 2003, when real 
GDP grew by only 0.3%, economic activity finally 
started to pick up
 again in the first half of 2004. 
However, the pace of recovery was significantly 
slower than in the rest of the euro area and appears to 
rest on uneven foundations. The driving forces have 

not consolidated yet, with private consumption 
expenditure exhibiting a fairly unsteady pattern, the 
inventory cycle tapering off and exports benefiting 

with a long lag from the buoyancy of world trade 
growth. Only gross fixed capital formation seems to 
have embarked on a steady upward path. 
Based on the available evidence, the economic 
recovery is not likely to ga
in much momentum in the 
second half of 2004. It will continue at a relatively 

measured pace and is expected to yield an annual 
average rate of economic growth of 1.3%, 0.8 of a 
percentage point less than the euro area average.  
Despite weak economic growth and a still sizeable 
negative output gap inflation remained sticky at 
around 2.3% throughout the year. As a reaction to this 
and in view of the high pri
ce of oil, the government 
decided to freeze a series of controlled prices and 
tariffs in 2004. It also re
ached an agreement with 
large retailers to keep 
prices of certain products 
unchanged until the end of the year on a voluntary 
basis in exchange for the 
prospect of new legislation 
liberalising the sector.  The labour market continued to create new jobs at a 
relatively healthy pace in the first part of 2004. 
According to the national accounts statistics the 
number of full time equivalents increased by 0.6% 
compared to the same period last year. With a view to 
harmonise national statistics with EU legislation the 

Italian Statistical Office carried out a major reform of 
the labour force survey in 2004. The new method 
entailed a shift in the level of most labour market 

series. The rate of unem
ployment is consistently 
lower compared to the previous labour force survey. 
In particular, the 2003 annual average is now recorded 

at 8.4%, as opposed to 8.7% before. 
Growth prospects to 2006  
In view of the lagged revival in 2004, the Italian 
economy is expected to diverge somewhat from the 

cyclical pattern foreseen in the rest of the EU. While 
most EU economies are expected to decelerate 
somewhat in 2005 and 2
006, echoing the assumed 
slowdown in world trade and global growth, Italy is 
projected to gradually catch up from behind. Real 
GDP growth is forecast to rise to 1.8% in 2005 and to 

stabilise in 2006. The growth
 differentialvis-à-vis the 
euro area average narrows but stays negative. 
The growth projection is es
sentially built upon the 
assumption that domestic demand will eventually 

steady and strengthen in view of a relatively broad set 
of favourable fundamentals
. Private consumption 
expenditure should benefit from ongoing job creation, 

real wage increases, and 
rising house prices. In a 
similar vein, investment is
 expected to remain on the 
upward path traced out in 2004 on the back of the 

improving business confidence, low real interest rates 
and rising profit margins.

6161Chapter 3 Member States, Italy- 62 - 
No major improvement is expected on the external 
side, where Italian exports are likely to face the déjà-
vu of the recent past. In particular, the erosion of ex- 

port markets is expected to continue reflecting the 
unfavourable specialisation 
of the Italian industry coupled with declining pr
ice competitiveness. As a 
result, net exports are projected to act as a drag on 
economic growth throughout the forecast period. The 
size of the drag is likely to decline as the appreciation 

of the euro levels out. Costs and prices  
Inflation is projected to eas
e only very slowly over the 
forecast horizon. Part of the stickiness will result from 

the lagged adjustment mechanism for electricity and 
gas prices charged to private households. This has 
dampened the impact of th
e sharp increase in oil 
prices in 2004 but will release the rest of the effect 
over the course of 
2005. Moreover, the aforementioned effort of th
e government to postpone 
the increase of controlled prices as well as the 
negotiated temporary price stop in parts of the retail 
sector are likely to trigger a rebound at the beginning 

of 2005. Subsequently, the 
still negative output gap, 
the projected increase in 
productivity and slowing 
import prices, are expected to work their way through 

to consumer price inflation. Overall, the annual 
increase in the HICP is likely to drop below the 2% 
threshold only towards the end of 2006. 
Labour market 
The measured pace of economic expansion in 2005 
and 2006 is projected to be accompanied by an 
essentially steady annual increase of employment. As 
in the past several years, 
the head count figures will 
grow faster than the full-time equivalents reflecting 
the higher degree of f
lexibility ensuing from the 
successive stages of labour market reform 
implemented since the mid-1990s. The job content of 
economic growth is projected to ease somewhat as the 

level effect resulting from the 
reforms is expected to 
peter out, giving way to a more traditional link 
between GDP and employment growth. The 

‚normalisation™ of the labour market is also expected 
to flatten the downward trend in the rate of 
unemployment. 
Public finances 
The general government defi
cit is estimated to reach 
3.0% of GDP in 2004, as compared to 2.4% of GDP 
in 2003 and to an 
initial target of 2.2% of GDP. A 
sizable decrease in interest 
expenditure falls short to 
compensate a marked deterioration of the primary 
surplus, which is forecast to drop to 2.0% of GDP. In 

cyclically-adjusted terms 
both the budget deficit and 
the primary surplus deteriorate significantly compared 
to 2003.  The budgetary outturn in 2004 also reflects a 
declining contribution from one-off measures. 
Specifically, in 2003 temporary measures reduced the 

deficit by more than 2 percentage points of GDP. In 
2004, higher than planned revenues from tax 
amnesties are expected to offset the limited success of 

other temporary measures, i.e. the amnesty for zoning 
code violations and sale 
of publicly-owned real assets. 
In the Commission forecast, the total impact of one-

off measures amounts to around 1½ pp of GDP in 
2004. The Commission deficit forecast of 3% for 2004 is 
marginally above the official target of 2.9% of GDP 

because of a residual uncertainty attached to a part of 
the very recently disclosed administrative measures 
complementing the additional fiscal correction 

announced in July this year. 
In 2005, the general governm
ent deficit is projected to 
remain at 3% of GDP, while the primary surplus is 
expected to improve marginally to 2.1%. As the 

output gap is projected to narrow in 2005 this 
projection would entail a deterioration of the 
underlying budgetary positi
on as measured by the 
cyclically-adjusted budget balance.  
The Commission forecast presupposes a full 
implementation of the fiscal adjustment presented in 

the draft 2005 budget which is officially expected to 
close the gap between the unchanged legislation 
deficit of 4.4% of GDP and the target of 2.7% of 

GDP. The target is 1.2 percentage point higher than 
the objective presented in 
the 2003 updated stability 
programme. The difference between the Commission 

deficit forecast and the government target is due to the 
following two elements. First, the draft budget 
assumes an increase in real GDP of 2.1% as compared 

to 1.8% in the Commi
ssion scenario. The lower 
growth projection accounts for one decimal point of 
62Chapter 3 Member States, Italy- 63 - 
the deficit to GDP ratio. Second, the remaining two 
decimal points of the difference in the deficit 
projection refer to a classification issue. The Italian 

Government has classifi
ed ANAS, the public 
company in charge of the maintenance of state roads, 
outside the general government sector as of 2005. 

However, at this stage it seems unlikely that ANAS 
will meet the ESA95 conditions to qualify as part of 
the private sector in that year.  
The Commission deficit projection for 2005 does not 
incorporate the repeatedly announced tax cuts, as no 
measures were officially adopted before the cut-off 
date of this forecast.  
The balance of risks is clearly skewed towards a 
higher deficit in 2005. The 
authorities plan to achieve 
a large fiscal correction combined with a deficit 

neutral tax cut. Overall, this strategy entails an 
adjustment of around 2¼ % of GDP, the largest of the 
current legislative period. Implementation of the 2% 
ceiling on the nominal annual increase in primary 
expenditure excluding pens
ions - the main pillar of 
the fiscal adjustment - will prove very challenging 
especially in health care. Even a small deviation from 
budget plans will imply a deficit above the 3% of 

GDP reference value. 
Following established prac
tice, the deficit projection 
for 2006 of 3.6% of GDP is based on unchanged 
legislation. In spite of privatisation 
and securitisation proceeds amounting to 1.5% of GDP, the debt ratio is projected 
to decline by only 0.2 percentage point in 2004, to 
106% of GDP. In 2005, the debt is forecast to 
decrease to 104.6% of GDP, discounting the 
announced disposal of financial assets estimated at 

around 1.8% of GDP. The same volume of disposals 
is expected in 2006
, when the debt ratio is projected 
to decline by a mere 0.2% of GDP.

 Growth picking up and fiscal consolidation  
- 64 - 
The economy in 2003  
The unfavourable external environment continued to 
negatively affect tourism in 2003. As in 2002, real 
GDP growth reached 2%. Economic activity was 

mainly driven by domestic demand, notably in 
government and construction investment and 
consumption (notably public sector wages) as fiscal 

policy turned more expansionary, widening the fiscal 
deficit to 6.4% of GDP. Private consumption 
increased by 2.4%, underpin
ned by rising disposable 
income linked to high wage growth, continuing near-
full employment conditions, and aided by tax reform 
(including lower marginal 
income tax rates). Private 
investment dropped by mo
re than 3%. However, 
corrected for purchases of ships and aircraft in 2002, 

investment increased by about 4%, mainly driven by 
investment in construction and machinery/equipment. 
Demand was further supported through lower real 

interest rates, resulting from slightly increased 
inflation rates and a 0.5% nominal rate decrease in 
April 2003. Tourist arrivals declined 
by nearly 5%, linked to the 
Iraq war, SARS and low EU growth. Moreover 
receipts fell by 10%, due to price discounts. Together 
with slow growth in Midd
le East export markets and 
deteriorating competitiveness as the Cyprus pound 
(linked to the euro) appreciated vis-à-vis the dollar 
and pound, total real export growth remained near-

stagnant. Modest domestic demand and export growth 
made imports drop by 1%, while the terms of trade 
improved slightly. Altogether, the current account 
(CA) deficit decreased to 3.5% of GDP. 
Prospects  
The forecast for 2004 projects a modest rebound in 
real GDP growth to 3.5%. The recovery is mainly 
domestic-demand led, but the slightly more positive 

2004 growth prospects for the EU (especially the UK 
and Germany, Cyprus™ main 
tourist source countries) 
also support this outlook. Th
e rebound is expected to 
strengthen somewhat further in 2005 and 2006 to 
around 4%. External demand (tourism) is also 
projected to accelerate after the sluggish expansion so 

far. However, uncertainties rema
in, notably in tourism 
and oil price developments, where Cyrus is 
vulnerable. Hence, given the fragile international 
growth outlook, the forecast remains cautious on 
tourist arrivals and receipts.  
GDP components  
The gradual recovery starting in the 2
nd half of 2003 
strengthened in early 2004
, with GDP growth in Q1 
and Q2 at y-o-y 3.6% an
d 4.1% respectively. For 2004 consumption growth is projected at 3.2% while 

for 2005-2006 marginally hi
gher rates are foreseen, 
stimulated by much the same factors as 2003. 
Recovering investment growth 
in 2004 is expected to 
reach 5.3% and then continue to show vigorous 
growth for the remainder of the period, given that 
structural growth factors such as EU accession, 

ongoing liberalisation and restructuring in financial 
and utilities markets and planned infrastructure 
projects (airports in Larnaca and Paphos and a port in 

Larnaca) are still in place.  
Tourism has been recovering markedly more slower 
than expected so far. Arrivals in Jan-September 
increased by only 2.9%, (well) below historical 
growth rates. With strengthening domestic demand 
and import growth, the CA deficit for 2004 is 

projected to rise to 4.5% 
of GDP and then to decline 
to 3.7% by 2006, linked to modest export recovery, 
fiscal consolidation, and Œfor 2006-improving terms 

of trade.  
Costs and prices, labour market 
Following increases in VAT
 and excise duties in line 
with the EU 
acquis
, inflation increased to 4% in 2003, 
although the appreciation of the 
pound and the drop in 
industrial import prices tempered price pressures. For 
Jan-September 2004, inflation stood at 1.6% 
compared to the same period in 2003.

For both 2004 and 2005, inf
lation is expected to reach 
2.4%, linked also to oil price pressures, before inching 
down to 2.1% by 2006, in line with previous VAT-

related inflation spikes. 
To counter devaluation 
rumours related to, 
inter alia
, political uncertainty 
after the Greek Cypriot ‚No™ vote to the UN Annan 

plan and capital outflow ri
sks following full capital 
liberalisation on the eve of EU accession, the Central 
Bank of Cyprus in April increased interest rates by 

1%-point. The Cyprus pound 
remained stable against 
the euro and in subsequent months, capital outflows 
reversed again.  
Unemployment increased to 4.4% in 2003 but is 
expected to move downward again to below 4% in the 
forecast period as growth picks up. It can also be 

noted that the limited border opening with the Turkish 
Cypriot community (T/C) in the North has led to an 
increasing share of daily commuting T/C workers in 
total employment (to about 1%). 
Public finances  
Government revenues in Ja
n-August 2004 increased 
by 15% and expenditure by 0.5% compared to the 
same period last year. 
However, major parts of 
expenditure takes place at the end of the year, while 
there have been delays 
in introducing some 2004 
fiscal consolidation revenue measures. Nevertheless, 

given these results, the forecast expects that the 2004 
deficit target of 5.2% of GDP will be met. For 2005 
the deficit is projected at 3.0% of GDP or marginally 
above the Convergence Programme (CP) target, given 
the Commission™s slightly more cautious GDP growth 

projection. Similarly, for 2006, the forecast projects a 
deficit of 2.4% or slightly higher than in the CP, 
mainly due to a relatively lower projected GDP 

growth.

656512.Latvia
Continuous robust growth but with some imbalances 
- 66 -  
Recent developments in activity 
In 2003, GDP growth was 7.5% (6.4% in 2002). 
Private consumption and gross fixed capital formation 
have been the driving factors for growth. Strong 

private consumption was supported by employment 
growth, rising real wages and increased bank lending. 
Gross fixed capital formation remained buoyant as a 

result of favourable credit 
conditions and reinforced 
macroeconomic stability. Th
e first half of 2004 
produced further expansion. Growth in the first two 

quarters was 8.8% and 7.7% respectively (y-o-y). 
Exports grew 4.3% y-o-y
; however, imports grew 
three times faster (13.9%), widening the already large 
external deficit.  
Prospects for 2004-2006 
Growth prospects for 2004-2006 are strong with an 
expected growth rate of 7½% in 2004 and just below 

7% in 2005 and 2006. Final domestic demand is 
expected to drive growth, primarily led by increases 
in private consumption on the back of sustained 

increases in real disposable income and better credit 
access. Over the entire forecast period, private 
consumption is expected to continue to show healthy 

growth peaking in 2004 follo
wed by a slight easing in 
2005 and 2006. The expansion of investment is likely 
to remain high over the fo
recast period with housing 
investment increasing strongly. 
The recovery of the EU economy and positive 
externalities of Latvia™s accession to the EU will keep 
export growth strong. Nevertheless, import growth is 

expected to remain robust due to the increase of 
investment and intermediate
 goods reflecting buoyant 
investment and strong 
growth of manufacturing. 
Thus, for 2004 the negative 
growth contribution from 
net exports remains considerable at about 3 

percentage points. Although import growth is 
expected to slow somewhat in 2005, allowing for a 
slight narrowing of the trade balance, the net 

contribution to GDP growth from trade is also 
expected to be considerable and negative in 2005 and 
2006. Accordingly, real GDP is expected to grow at 

around 7% in all forecast years. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
High growth has contributed to lowering the  
unemployment rate, though 
upward pressure on 
unemployment from enterprise and rural restructuring 
is expected to persist. In spite of a strong growth 
performance, and sizeable employment gains since 

2001, the unemployment rate thus remains at around 
10% of the labour force and is forecast to drop only 
slightly in the medium 
term. Moderate employment 
gains of around ½% per year over the forecast period 
will contribute to the declin
e, although considerable 
regional development disparities will hold back a 

faster improvement in labour market conditions.  
Since summer 2003 inflatio
n has been rising. The 
pick up of prices has been
 reflected in all inflation 
indices, with that for pr
oducer prices starting to 
outpace consumer prices. For 2003 inflation reached 
2.9%, up from 2.0% in 2002. This was partly due to 
higher regulated prices for gas, heating and rent as 

well as to a sharp rise in healthcare costs. Imports also 
became more expensive. Price levels accelerated even 
further in the first quarter of 2004. The inflation 
increase in 2004 is largely the consequence of one-off 
events, such as EU entry-related tax and price 

adjustments, and a significant depreciation of the lats 
vis-à-vis the euro at the end of 2003. The main risk to 
the inflation outlook is th
at price increases could 
become persistent if strong demand continues to drive 
output above potential and feed into inflation 
expectations. Taking this in
to account, inflation is 
expected to reach 6.8% in 2004 and to fall back to a 
about 3½% in 2006. 
The external account 
Given the net export performance noted above, the 
current account deficit increased to 8.6% of GDP in 

2003.   In   2004   the  c
urrent   account   balance  will

deteriorate further to about 10% of GDP due to a 
disproportionate rise in imports of goods prior to 
Latvia™s accession to the European Union, and the 

purchase of new vessels adding 1.5% of GDP to the 
current account deficit. Latvia™s external balance will 
improve as soon as modernization of the economy 

allows an increase in share of high value-added 
exports. However, during the forecast period 
investment needs will dominate and improvement will 

be gradual. The worsening of the trade balance is 
expected to be compensate
d by increasing surplus on 
the services account, thus the current account deficit 
will remain roughly at th
e same level throughout the 
forecast period. The sectoral net lending position will 

improve relative to the curre
nt account, reflecting the 
build-up of capital transfers received from the EU. 
Public finances 
The general government defi
cit in 2003 decreased to 
1.5% of GDP largely due to better than expected tax 
revenues. In August 2004
 the Latvian Parliament 
approved amendments to the budget law to provide 
for additional expenditure in
 2004 of approximately 
0.9% of GDP. Nevertheless, the budget deficit is 
expected to remain within 
the target of 2% of GDP in 
the light of very strong growth and an emerging tax 

overshoot in the first half of 2004. For the forecast 
period a broadening of the indirect tax base should 
outweigh the cut in the corp
orate income tax rate in 
force since January 2004. However, the draft 2005 
budget law as adopted in September represents a 
marked shift towards a more expansionary fiscal 
policy. Consequently, in the absence of budget 
amendments, the deficit could be expected to 

approach 3% of GDP in 2005-2006.

676713.Lithuania
Strong growth with pressures on the external and fiscal balances 
- 68 - 
Recent developments 
The Lithuanian economy continued to expand briskly 
in recent months. After increasing by 9.7% in 2003, 
real output expanded furthe
r by 7.2% in the first half 
of 2004 against the same period of the previous year. 
Growth continued to be driven by domestic demand, 
as the pace of expansion of investment and private 

consumption remained particularly rapid in the wake 
of EU accession-related investment projects, very 
strong credit growth and an improving labour market.  
Although foreign trade data 
in 2004 are not fully 
comparable with 2003 due to methodology changes, 
data available point to an acceleration of exports in 

the first half of 2004 that was amply outpaced by 
import growth. Preliminary estimations set the current 
account deficit at some 10% of GDP in the first half 

of 2004, largely due to a widening trade deficit 
induced by the investment and consumption surge and 
a build-up of stocks in anticipation of higher taxes for 

certain imported goods after EU accession. 
Lithuania™s contribution to the EU budget in the 
second quarter contributed further to the deterioration. 

A significant increase in foreign direct investment 
flows in the first half of the year has contributed to 
partly finance the deficit increase. 
The deflationary trend initiated 
in 2002 reversed in 
the second quarter of 2004, 
mainly reflecting a strong 
contribution from oil and food prices and tax 
alignments required upon accession. Labour demand 

remained buoyant in the pr
ivate sector and led to a 
further decrease in the unemployment rate, which is 
estimated to have fallen below 12.5% in the first half 
of 2004. Growth prospects  
Real GDP growth is expected to remain robust, 
sustained by continued buoyancy in private 
consumption and investment, but growth is foreseen 

to moderate gradually from 7.1% in 2004 to 5.9% in 
2006. Domestic demand growth is estimated to slow 
down progressively in 2005-2006, partly in response 

to the reduced stimulus from fiscal policy and 
increasing interest rates.  
GDP growth is expected to become more balanced 
towards the end of the forecast horizon, with the 
contribution of net exports 
gradually improving after 
a sharp deterioration in 2004. Export growth is 

foreseen to accelerate in 2005-2006 on the back of 
increasing external demand and expanded production 
capacity. The government™s fiscal consolidation plans 

in 2006 and an expected moderation of the present 
credit growth dynamics are likely to contribute to 
improve Lithuania™s savings-
investment balance, with 
the current account deficit decreasing to about 7.9% 
of GDP from an expected peak of 8.7% in 2004. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
Inflation is expected to accelerate further in the 
second half of 2004, but the annual average inflation 

rate is forecast to increase only moderately by 1.2%. 
Higher oil, transport and health prices, coupled with 
the effect of tax alignments due to EU accession, are 

expected to continue leading the increase in inflation 
in the last months of 2004. Annual average inflation is 
expected to accelerate further in 2005-2006 and reach 

2.8-2.9%, under the impact of higher wage inflation 
and price increases in the regulated sectors and public 
transport.  Overall, the labour market is expected to improve in 
line with the rapid economic expansion and more 
active labour market policies co
-financed by the EU. 
Employment growth is foreseen to remain relatively 
strong, driven by firm la
bour demand by the private 
sector. The unemployment rate is expected to decline 

gradually from 12.7% in 2003 to 9.9% in 2006.  Wage 
growth is expected to accelerate during the forecast 
horizon with some pressure on unit labour costs as a 

consequence.

2002 to 1.9% in 2003, undershooting the 2.4% of 
GDP target foreseen in the budget for 2003. 
The general government deficit is expected to 
increase significantly in 2004 to 2.6% of GDP. The 

main factors contributing to the deficit increase are a 
sharp increase in capital e
xpenditure led by new 
investment projects co-financed by the EU, higher 

public consumption driven by salary increases for 
public sector workers, the transition costs of the 
pension reform and a significant increase in social 

welfare benefits and subsidies. Government 
investment and current expenditure growth are 
expected to remain robust in 2004-2005, due to co-
financing of EU structural and cohesion funds 
projects, further salary increases in the public sector 

and rising pensions and social welfare benefits. 
Revenue growth is expect
ed to be strong over the 
forecast period, particularly income and wealth taxes 
and social contributions, on the back of increasing 
minimum and average salaries, growing employment 
and rising corporate profits. The forecast assumes 
that, after the initial deterioration of the general 

government deficit, the government remains 
committed to fiscal consolida
tion, which is expected 
to play a role in containing external imbalances and 

smooth household consumption. The deficit is 
projected to decrease from 2.5% of GDP in 2005 to 
1.9% in 2006, when public consumption and 
investment growth are expected to slow down, as the 
initial impact of accession on public investment 
gradually fades. The deficit projection for 2006 also 
assumes a lower increase in social spending and 
salaries than in 2004 
and 2005. Several factors introduce some uncertainty for the general 
government deficit forecast, particularlythe transition 
costs of the pension reform and the impact of the 

change of VAT collection upon EU accession.

696914.Luxembourg
Still growing faster than its neighbours 
- 70 - 
The situation in 2003 and 2004 
Growth in Luxembourg was significantly stronger in 
recent years than had been previously thought as real 
GDP rose by 1.5% in 2001 and 2.5% in 2002 (revised 

data) and by 2.9% in 2003 according to a first 
estimate. Once again, Luxembourg has thus 
succeeded in keeping a significant positive growth 

differential with its neigh
bours. Private consumption 
was rather subdued in 2003
 as the positive effects of 
the 2001-2002 tax cuts had probably for a large part 

faded away. Investment decreased by more than 6% 
but only because of a drop in the purchase of 
airplanes by Luxembourg-ba
sed airlines. Exports of 
goods decreased too but also because of exceptional 
factors, namely a fall in the re-exports of cellular 

telephones.  
This rather strong activity resulted in a rise in 
domestic employment by 3% in 2002 (after 5.7% in 
2001) and 1.8% in 2003, which was much faster than 

in neighbouring countries. Like in previous years, 
however, national employment only rose by about 
1%, while the number of non-residents working in 

Luxembourg, in comparison, increased by nearly 4%. 
Consequently, job creation 
was not strong enough to 
prevent a further increase in unemployment, which 

rose from 2.8% of active population in 2002 to 3.7%. 
There are no quarterly national accounts in 
Luxembourg but all availa
ble indicators show a 
significant acceleration in growth this year. Industry 

is performing very well with the steel sector recording 
exceptional growth rates. Construction is buoyant too, 
with the sole exception of
 public works which had 
been rising very fast in recent years due to a strong 
increase in government investment. In the financial 
sector, activity has stopped decreasing and is posting 

positive growth rates since the first half of 2004. 
Moreover, both private consumption and investment 
should accelerate, the former because it grew below 

its long term average in 2003 and both job creation as 
well as wage increases should boost it, the latter 
because its fall last year was only due to incidental 

factors.The creation of jobs is accelerating again, rising year-
on-year by more than 2% in the latest months. As 
usual, this entails a significantly slower increase in 
residents employment (about 1% in annual terms at 
the moment) and a much faster rise in the number of 

non-resident workers (more than 4% a year in recent 
months). 
Inflation has been accelerating in recent months but 
mostly due to the rise in oil prices and to the 

exceptionally high weight of 
oil products in the HICP 
in Luxembourg: the annual rate of increase in the 
HICP, which was 2.5% on av
erage in 2003, jumped to 
between 3½% and 4% since May. However, the rise 
in the national CPI (fro
m which purchases by non 
residents are excluded, especially their substantial 

purchases of car fuel and 
tobacco) is still in the 
neighbourhood of 2.5%, as
 against 2% in 2003. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
 GDP growth is expected to decelerate slightly in 
2005 and to remain more or
 less at the same level in 
2006: whereas private consumption should continue 
to speed up in line with
 job creation, the external 
environment is likely to be 
less supportive with export 
market growth slowing down slightly. Investment 
should be rather buoyant but the small size of the 

country makes it extremely erratic and difficult to 
forecast.In the light of the expected acceleration in activity, 
employment growth, too, should slightly increase 

over the forecast period. As a result, unemployment 
should probably stop rising next year and could even 
begin to decrease in 2006. However, this decrease 

might happen later and be slower than the rapid 
growth in employment would suggest: there seem to 
be increasing signs of mismatches between the skills 

of the unemployed and th
ose required by firms; 
Moreover, due to higher wages and unemployment 
benefits in Luxembourg, the reservation wages of

residents are clearly higher than those of non 
residents, which favours the latter in the competition 
for available jobs. 
Inflation should slow down slightly during the 
forecast period in line with the expected decrease in 
oil prices, with the HICP slowing more than the 
national CPI because of the larger weight of oil 

products. 
Public finances 
Last March, Luxembourg authorities had reported a 
very slight deficit (0.1% of GDP) for 2003. However, 
it turns out that this wa
s actually a 0.8% of GDP 
surplus due to better-than-expected revenues from 
both indirect and direct taxes but also to lower than 

projected expenditure, especi
ally investment by local 
authorities. For this year, reportings by the 
Luxembourg authorities show a deficit at about 1.9% 
of GDP. However, tax revenues seem more buoyant 
than projected because of faster-than-expected growth 
and of the relatively rapid rise in wages. As a result, 

the deficit should be significantly lower than was 
expected up to now. 
There is no budget yet for 
2005 and, due to the June 
general election, it will not be
 submitted to Parliament 
before October 20th. Consequently, the projection for 
2005 and 2006 is purely technical and based on a ﬁno 
policy changeﬂ assumption. Its main feature is that the 

rise in revenues would gradually accelerate over the 
forecast period while expenditure would slow down 
from the high rates of increase recorded in recent 
years. However, spending wo
uld still be rising faster 
than receipts at the end of the period. As a result - and 

bar a faster-than-expected increase in revenues (which 
is often the case in Luxemb
ourg) - the deficit should progressively widen.

Favourable shift in growth components - 72 - 
The situation in 2004  
The pick-up of real GDP growth continued in the first 
half of 2004 with year-on-year real growth rates of 
over 4%. This dynamism is e
xpected to continue in 
the second half of the year and to result in an annual 
real GDP growth rate of close to 4%. Since the last 
quarter of 2003, real 
GDP growth has been 
increasingly based on strongly accelerating export and 
investment growth. At the same time, private 
consumption, which had bolstered GDP growth in 

recent years, more than halved due to a significant 
decrease in net disposable income.  
Followingthree years of strong wage increases
,public real wages decelerated in 2004 and even 
slightly declined below zero
.After a strong slowdown 
in the first half of 2004, private wages picked up in 

the second half of the year. Consumer price inflation 
accelerated sharply to a level of around 7% in 2004. 
In the first quarter of 2004
 the increase was mainly 
related to indirect tax increases and price adjustments, 
while supply-side factors (rising oil and unprocessed 
food prices) accounted for the high levels in the 

second quarter. The moderate 
disinflation of the third 
quarter is expected to continue.  
Unemployment remains slightly below 6%. Despite 
some fiscal tightening, the current account deficit is 

forecast to remain at about 9% of GDP in 2004. This 
is largely due to the widening of the trade deficit and 
the deceleration of private consumption growth. The 

acceleration of import growth in the first half of the 
year might have partly been related to pre-purchases 
before Hungary™s EU-accession. It is expected to 
remain dynamic for the remainder of the year, given 
the high import share of the 
strongly growing exports.  
Growth prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Real GDP growth is forecast to remain solid in the 
forecast period, based further on exports, investment 

and consumption. Export growth, however, is 
expected to slightly slow 
down after the strong 2004 
performance. After easing somewhat in 2005, 

investment growth is expect
ed to be boosted by EU 
related investment. Given the moderate growth of real 
disposable income, private consumption is forecast to 
grow only moderately above 3% during the 
forecasting period, with an upward risk in the election 

year 2006. Following their significant deceleration in 2004, 
public wages are forecast to increase only marginally 
in the remaining forecast pe
riod. Private sector wages 
would grow faster, against the risk of bottlenecks in 
the labour market. The unemployment rate is forecast 
to decline slightly from 5.
9% of the labour force in 
2004 to 5.8% by 2006. Employment would continue 
to grow by around ½% per year. The moderate 
disinflation that started in the 
second half of 2004 is 
expected to accelerate sharply in the first months of 
2005 due to base effects. 
A further continuous but 
moderate disinflation is projected for the remaining 

forecast period.  
Balance of payment developments 
The moderate domestic demand growth and some 
fiscal tightening will contribute to some narrowing of 
the current account deficit, but it would still remain at 
around 8½ % of GDP by 2006
1.Public finances 
The reduction of the general government deficit 
continued in 2004. However, despite the higher-than-

expected real GDP growth in 2004, the official 
general government deficit ta
rget of 4.6% of GDP for 
this year will be missed. This was acknowledged by 

the upward revision of the of
ficial target to 5.3% of 
GDP. The slippage can be attributed to higher-than- 
1Due to an accounting modification, re-invested earnings are 
included both in the income account of the current account and in 
the FDI account of the capital account since April 2004. The 

magnitude of the revision is an increase int he deficit of about 3 
percentage points.-4-202468101214162000200120022003200420052006

expected VAT and personal income tax revenue 
shortfalls and higher-than-forecast expenditures. The 
Commission forecasts with 5.5% of GDP a slightly 

higher deficit than the revised official target.
As for the remainder of the forecast period, several 
measures (which were partly carried out in the 
previous years, but will only have fiscal effects in 

2005 or 2006) shou
ld help to contain overspending 
and revenue shortfall as experienced in the last two 
years. These measures are notably the narrowing of 

the eligibility criteria for ho
using loans and tax 
exemptions, an agreement with pharmaceutical 
producers on the maximum amount of subsidies, the 
ongoing downsizing of public employees. The fact 
that a large majority of the public investment is 

planned to be carried out as a public private 
partnership project, should result in a one off saving 
effect in 2005. However, there are also indications that no substantial 
consolidation can be expected for the rest of the 
forecast period. While the foreseen cuts in personal 

income tax are not fully compensated by the increase 
of other taxes, resulting in a decline of the 
revenue/GDP ratio, there is still the risk of overly 

optimistic assumptions for certain revenues (mainly 
VAT). Also, the budget is burdened by high net 
interest payments, accounting for about 4½% of GDP. 
Moreover, the more substantive expenditure saving 
structural reforms announced in the convergence 
programme have not yet been effectively addressed. 
The double election year of 2006 indicates, 
furthermore, the risk of highe
r current expenditure on 
central and local government level in both 2005 and 
2006. Gross debt will remain slightly below 60% of 
GDP during the forecast period.

737316.Malta
Paving the way for economic recovery 
- 74 - 
Recent economic developments in 2004 
Real GDP grew by 0.2% in 2003, mostly stemming 
from both private and public consumption and gross 
fixed capital formation. The GFCF growth rate was 

artificially inflated by the base effect of a one-off 
operation (the disposal of an aircraft of Air Malta) 
registered as a negative investment in 2002. The 

change in stocks added notably to the GDP growth as 
well, whereas the external
 sector contribution was 
negative.  
After reaching  2.3% in the first quarter, GDP growth 
could not maintain momentum and fell by 1.5% in the 
second quarter. In the first half of 2004, private 

consumption remained sluggish, partly because of 
high household spending in th
e last quarter of 2003 in 
anticipation to the rise in the VAT standard rate as 

from 2004. For the year
 as a whole, private 
consumption is expected to fall slightly due to the 
uncertain economic environment, whereas public 

consumption is set to decelerate significantly. As a 
consequence of ongoing fiscal consolidation, the main 
contribution to GDP growth, however,,comes from 

gross fixed capital formation, which albeit briskly 
decelerating, is set to grow by 7%, mainly due to 
infrastructure investment. Overall, domestic demand 

is expected to positively c
ontribute to growth (1.5%), 
although partially offset by
 a negative contribution of 
stockbuilding of half a percentage point.   
Within this scenario of domestic demand, imports are 
projected to slowdown substantially. Conversely, 
exports are set to pick up sharply due to more 
dynamic world demand. As a result, the external 
sector is foreseen to r
ecord a slightly positive 
contribution to GDP growth, which should post a rate 
of 1% in 2004, up 
from 0.2% in 2003. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
For 2005 and 2006, private consumption is expected 
to gain momentum and thus become the main growth 
driving force. However, public consumption is 
projected to keep decelerating and stay rather flat. 

Furthermore, the gradual completion of public 
investment projects will moderate investment. All in 
all, the joint contribution of domestic demand and 
stockbuilding should rema
in almost changed at 
around 1%. Conversely the contribution of the 

external sector is foreseen to increase gradually to 
reach almost 1% stemming mainly from exports 
recovery. On these bases, GDP growth is set to speed 

up to 1.5% and 1.8% in 
2005 and 2006, respectively.   
Costs and prices 
The sharp increase in oil 
prices has not yet fully 
impacted on costs and prices due to the time lag 
between price rises in the 
international market and the 
moment they are reflected to the internal energy 
prices. Despite subdued internal demand the HICP 
will raise to 3.7% in 2004, reflecting higher fuel 

prices and the increase of VAT rates. The impact of 
the latter will dilute in 
2005 and 2006, bringing the 
HICP down to 3.1% and 2.6% respectively.   
Labour market 
In accordance with sluggish economic activity, job 
creation will remain modest. Moreover, slow growth 
and on-going restructuring in the manufacturing 
sector are likely to increase the unemployment rate to 
8.4% in 2004. As economic recovery gains 
momentum and the real unit labour costs increases 

remain modest, the unemployment rate should 
gradually improve in the subsequent years. 
External accounts The current account deficit is set to narrow to 4% of 
GDP in 2004 from 5.3% of GDP in 2003, as a result 

of stronger exports. The 
predicted economic recovery, 
partly sustained by external demand, should entail a 
declining current account deficit throughout the 

forecast period to 2.8% of GDP in 2006. Indeed,

757517. NetherlandsEmerging gradually 
- 76 - 
The situation in 2004  
According to the most recent data, real GDP fell by 
0.9% in 2003, the first 
time that overall economic 
activity contracted since 1982. However, economic 
activity recovered in the second half of the year. This 
recovery continued into 2004 and available data and 
indicators show a steady, albeit gradual, improvement 
in underlying economic conditions. Increasingly, the 
Dutch economy benefited from booming international 
trade. At the same time, domestic demand remained 

lacklustre, as private consumption was held back by 
weak household disposable income and low 
confidence, fiscal policy was tightened, and 
investment adjusted to 
low profitability during the 
downturn. The labour market deteriorated in a lagged 
response to the downtur
n, but the decline in employment was more moderate in the second 
quarter, while over the summer the seasonally 

adjusted unemployment r
ate even fell slightly. 
Consumer price inflation decreased markedly in the 

first nine  months of the year, to 1.0% in September, 

the lowest rate since June 1989, reflecting weak 
economic activity, low import prices, and the effect of 
the agreement among social partners to moderate 

wage increases. 
Sluggish recovery in domestic demand 
Economic activity is forecast to further improve over 
the projection period, albe
it only gradually. This 
mainly reflects the sluggi
sh performance of domestic 
demand, primarily private consumption. A recovery 

in private consumption appears to be held back not 
only by weak disposable 
income, but also by low 
confidence among consumers. This seems to reflect 

inter alia the uncertainty among consumers 
concerning the consequences of the restructuring of 
the social security and pension systems, as well as 
increasing tensions between the government and 

social partners. In 2005, private consumption growth 
is expected to reach 0.9%, compared to 0.5% in 2004. 
Consumption is expected to grow modestly in 2005, 

in spite of weak real dispos
able income (due to the 
moderate rise in compensation, further increases in 

pension premiums, the impact of higher oil prices, 

and fiscal tightening) as 
the household savings ratio 
decreases somewhat. Private consumption growth will 
be barely more than 1% in 2006, but this is largely 
due to the mechanical impact of the reform in the 
healthcare system that will take place in that year.
3The reform should imply 
a shift in the recorded 
expenditure from private consumption to public 

expenditure on health care. While fiscal restraint 

should hold back government consumption and public 
investment, private investment is expected to 
accelerate in response to an improvement in 

profitability and improving
 demand conditions. The 
relatively low capacity utilisation in the near term 
would, however, militate against
 a sharp rise in the 
investment ratio. In contrast
 to the relatively sluggish 
recovery in domestic demand, the contribution from 

net exports should remain buoyant, as Dutch 

exporters benefit from the strength of world demand 
and an improvement in comp
etitiveness. Despite high oil prices, inflation should remain relatively subdued 
and pick up only slightly
 in 2006. Th
is relatively benign inflation development results from the impact 
of moderate wage increases, a cyclical pick-up in 
productivity growth, and weak import prices. The 
labour market will still deter
iorate in 2005, with the 
unemployment rate peaking at 5.0%. However, as 
employment growth is expected to reach 1.2% in 
2006, unemployment is forecast 
to fall slightly in that 
year.Deficit to fall in response to economic recovery and 
fiscal tightening 
Annual national accounts confirmed a general 
government deficit of 3.2% of GDP in 2003, an 

increase of 1.3% of GDP compared to the previous 
year. This marked deterioration occurred despite 
substantial fiscal tightening. It shows the sensitivity of 
Duch  public  finances  to  the  deep  and  protracted  
3 Due to the large uncertainties on the details of the health care 
reform, the present forecast encompasses a conservative estimate of 
the impact on consumption.

economic slowdown. However, other factors, 
including the rise in tax-exempt pension premiums, 
tax-deductible interest paymen
ts on mortgages, and a 
larger-than-expected rise in the deficit of the sub-
sector local government also played a role in the 
widening of the deficit. In order to stem the 

worsening of the public
 accounts, the authorities 
implemented a supplementary package of savings 
equivalent to 0.6% of GDP in
 April 2004; around half 
of these measures were of a one-off nature. As a 
consequence, the general government deficit is 
expected to fall to 
2.9% of GDP in 2004. 
The 2005 budget contains consolidation measures 
equivalent to around half a percentage point of GDP. 
The deficit-reducing measures in the 2005 budget 

comprise cuts in health expenditures, increases in 
income tax rates, reduced access to unemployment 
benefits, higher disability premiums, and the phasing 

out of subsidies on low-paid labour. For a large part, 
the savings in 2005 reflect the structural impact of 
measures that were part of the April 2004 adjustment 
package. The main additi
onal savings in the 2005 
budget are an increase in the rate for the first two 
income tax brackets and further cuts in net spending 
of ministries. In 2006, an end to fiscal facilities for 

early retirement should also help improve the general 
government balance. In the wake of fiscal tightening 
and a recovery in revenues in line with the expected 
economic recovery, the deficit is expected to fall to 
2.4% of GDP in 2005 and 2.1% of GDP in 2006. By 
contrast, the government debt to GDP ratio is 
projected to rise over the forecast horizon as a 
consequence of the rather modest pick-up in nominal 

GDP and the persistence of a headline deficit. The 
debt ratio is expected to increase from 54.1% in 2003 
to 58.4% in 2005.

777718.Austria
Cyclical upswing, but government deficit rising- 78 - 
Developments in 2004 
Real GDP is expected to grow
 in line with potential 
growth by 1.9% in 2004, following the modest 0.8% 
increase in 2003. Correspond
ing to the typical pattern 
of economic recovery in Austria, export demand will 
provide the initial impulse to stronger activity, before 
investment and finally private consumption follow. 
However, the composition of GDP in 2003 and 2004 
looks unusual (see graph belo
w). This is due to the 
private sector response to an investment subsidy that 
was paid for any additional investment exceeding the 
average of the last three years. Initially limited to 
2003 only, this policy measur
e resulted in a good deal 
of investment being carried 
forward in expectation of 
the recovery. This accounts for the strong contribution 
of domestic demand to GDP growth in 2003 

(rendering the contribution of external demand even 
negative), but also for the dip in investment in 2004, 
even though the subsidy was eventually extended to 

2004. On average over 2003 and 2004, investment 
grew according to the cyclical pattern of the economy. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
Despite government cons
umption remaining 
moderate, domestic demand is expected to contribute 

more strongly to real GDP growth, projected to 
accelerate until 2006. The income tax cuts taking 
effect in 2005 will gradually support private 

consumption. Also, strengthening demand for labour 
and higher nominal wages per capita will boost 
disposable income. However, higher energy costs are 

eroding households™ real purchasing power. 
Moreover, private confidence may be undermined by 
the fact that the tax cuts are leading to a wider 
government deficit than originally announced. Thus, 
the household saving ratio is projected to change little 

over the forecast period. 
After the policy-induced dip, investment is expected 
to return to healthy growth rates, underpinned by 
rising export earnings and the cuts in income and 

corporate taxes. However, construction investment 
may post only moderate gains, in view of slack 
demand for new homes and the persistent excess 

capacity of office space. In line with the assumption 
of a gradually slowing wo
rld economy and firming 
domestic demand, the contribution of net exports to 
GDP is expected to be pos
itive but diminishing over 
the projection period.  
Labour market, costs and prices  
After a slight decline in the previous year, total 
employment will pick up s
lightly in 2004 and 
continue rising up to the forecast horizon. With an 
elastic labour supply, unemployment is expected to 

fall only by a little in 200
5. The secular fall in self-
employment, in particular in agriculture, is 
continuing.  
Consumer price inflation in 
2004 is expected to rise 
considerably from last year, to a projected rate of 
2.2%, the main cause being oil prices, but also an 
increase in energy taxes and excise duties on tobacco. 

Towards the end of the forecast period, inflation 
should subside somewhat, with no further 
consumption tax increases planned and the oil price 

hike withering. Tariff wages are expected to mirror 
the cyclical upswing; however, the wage drift is not 
expected to accelerate. 
Public finances  
In January 2004, the first step of tax reform took 
effect. However, implicit shortfall in direct tax 
revenues was offset by rises 
in energy taxes and social 
contributions. Furthermore
, the low profit by the 
central bank in 2003 (due to low interest rates and a 
depreciating US-dollar) wi
ll dampen government 
revenue in 2004.  Government expenditures are expected to grow by 
2.5% in 2004, even though collective consumption 
expenditure is almost stagnating due to wage 

moderation  and  the  beneficial  effects  of  pension

reform on government expenditure. The budget deficit 
is expected to widen slightly
 to 1.3% of GDP in 2004, 
as compared with a narrowing to 0.7% of GDP in the 

last stability programme update. 
In 2005, a tax relief equalling 1% of GDP will be 
implemented. Wage and income taxes as well as 
enterprise taxes will be aff
ected to a similar extent. 
However, as private consumption is projected to 
recover only gradually from its meagre growth in 
2003, tax revenues in 2005 may be slightly weaker 

than expected by the government. Expenditures are 
expected to rise by a moderate 1.5% in 2005. The 
government deficit is projected at 2% of GDP in 
2005. Whereas the output gap is 
closing and event turning 
positive by 2006, earlier plans of an early return to 

budgetary balance have been at least postponed. The 
cyclically-adjusted deficit is expected to jump by 
almost one percentage point to 1.9% of GDP in 2005, 

but to drop slightly to 1.7% of GDP in 2006. 
General government debt will thus remain above the 
reference value of 60% of GDP throughout the 
forecast period and decline in 2005 and 2006.

Growing investment and improving fiscal outlook 
- 80 - 
Economic situation in 2004 
After two years of slow growth in 2001 and 2002, the 
Polish economy is experiencing a strong recovery. 
The upswing gradually
 gained strength in 2003 and in 
early 2004, with real GDP growth accelerating to 
6.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2004 from 4.7% 
in the last quarter of 
2003 and 3.8% in 2003 as a 
whole. Growth has become more balanced, with 
domestic demand gradually taking over from net 
exports as the main c
ontributor to growth. The 
expansion has been underpinned by supportive 
monetary conditions reinforced by a considerable 
loosening of fiscal policy this year. Moreover, the 
rapid growth of domestic demand in the first half of 
the year reflected a transitory pre-EU entry economic 

boom. As a result, activity is set to moderate in the 
coming quarters, and real GDP growth is projected to 
average 5.8% in 2004 as a whole. 
Prospects in 2005 and 2006 
With the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus, 
growth is expected to decelerate over the next two 
years. In particular, the forecast incorporates the 
recent interest rate hikes decided by the National 

Bank of Poland in response to the acceleration in 
inflation. Given also the expected moderate 
appreciation of the zloty against the euro, monetary 

conditions are set to be les
s supportive in the short 
term, while the long-delayed fiscal adjustment is 
projected to start in 2005. Overall, real GDP growth is 

projected to ease to 4.9% in
 2005 and 4.5% in 2006. 
Growth will be driven by domestic demand, with 
rising private consumption and a gradual rebound in 
investment spending, while
 the contribution of net 
exports is expected to turn negative from 2005 
onwards. 
GDP components 
After falling for 10 consecuti
ve quarters by over 15% 
in total, investment activity
 has started to recover 
timidly since the third 
quarter of 2003. Fixed 
investment remained weak in
 the first half of this 
year, rising by only 3.4% year-on-year. Investment 
growth is projected to accelerate gradually in the 
remainder of 2004 and in the next two years, against 

the backdrop of emerging capacity constraints, strong 
corporate profitability a
nd accession-related business opportunities. By 2006, investment should replace 
exports as the most dynamic element of aggregate 
demand.  
Private consumption has been
 surprisingly resilient 
this year despite high unemployment and weak real 
income growth, partly reflecting a spending boom 
triggered by fears of price increases after accession. 
Consumer demand is likely to strengthen over the 
forecast period, owing to improving employment 
prospects, faster real wage growth and growing 

consumer confidence. Payments to farmers linked to 
the Common Agricultural
 Policy will provide a 
further boost.  
Despite the loss in price 
competitiveness entailed by 
the appreciation of the zloty, export growth is 
expected to remain robust, boosted by productivity 
gains of Polish firms. Poland will continue to gain 

exports market shares thr
oughout the forecast period. However,  given  the  high  import  content  of Polish

exports and the expected recovery of investment 
activity, importgrowth is also projected to pick up 
strongly and should outpace export growth from 2005 

onwards. 
The risks to the growth outlook are skewed to the 
downside. Persistent fiscal and political uncertainties 
are a major source of concern for the strength of the 
expected investment r
ecovery. The behaviour of 
private consumption is also uncertain. In the near 
term, the more restrictive policy stance could hold 
back household spending. Nevertheless, once fiscal 
uncertainties are removed, improved consumer 
confidence could lead to faster-than-expected private 

consumption growth. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Unemployment peaked in 2002 at some 20% of the 
labour force and since then, it has started to decrease 
slowly. It is projected to st
ay virtually unchanged this 
year despite stronger grow
th. The persistence of job 
losses well into the recovery reflects substantial gains 
in labour productivity. 
There is also a large structural 
component in Poland™s unemployment. Labour 
market difficulties are further exacerbated by 
unfavourable demographic dynamics and the ongoing 

restructuring process in
 heavy industries and 
agriculture, which will entail sizeable job losses in the 
coming years. Employment growth is expected to 

resume in 2005, but in 
light of the deep-seated 
problems in the labour mark
et, it is unlikely to be 
sufficiently strong for unem
ployment to drop rapidly. 
Overall, the unemployment r
ate is projected to fall to 
18.1% in 2006 from 19.2% in 2003. 
Inflation has been accelerating sharply since April 
2004, with HICP inflation overshooting the upper 
limit of the central bank™s
 target band from June 
onwards. Core inflation an
d inflation expectations 
have also picked up signif
icantly. In order to contain 
second-round effects, the central bank raised its key 
reference rate by a cumulative 125 basis points to 

6.5% between June and August. The acceleration in 
headline inflation can be attributed to rising food and 
oil prices as well as accession-related increases in 

indirect taxes and, to a lesse
r extent, to the closing of 
the output gap. HICP inflation is expected to 
decelerate somewhat in the coming months and would 

average 3.5% in 2004, up from the very low level of 
0.7% in 2003.  
With the output gap expecte
d to turn pos
itive in 2005, 
higher oil prices and increasing unit labour costs, 
inflationary pressures are likely to persist. 

Nevertheless, this should no
t lead to a renewed rise in 
headline inflation. Th
anks to favourable 
developments in food prices and a restrictive 

monetary policy, consumer price inflation is projected 
to drop progressively to 3.
0% on average in 2006. 
Unit labour cost growth is projected to fall by 1.3% 
this year, owing to a cyc
lical pick-up in productivity 
to 6% and modest compensation growth. But labour 
cost growth is likely to increase over the next two 
years, as nominal compensation growth is expected to 
accelerate somewhat in 2005 and 2006 to offset this 
year™s very weak real wage growth. Nevertheless, 

high unemployment should limit wage pressures.  
External accounts Despite the deterioration in the terms of trade, the still 
robust export performance will result in a slight 
reduction in the trade deficit to 2.6% of GDP this 

year. But growing imports in line with strengthening 
domestic demand will lead to a steady widening of the 
trade deficit over the next two years. Over the 2004-

2006 forecast period, higher transfers from the EU 
will have a positive impact 
on both the current and 
capital accounts. The current account deficit is 

projected to gradually increase to 3.3% in 2006 from 
2.2% in 2003,  thus remaining at a level that can be 
easily covered by foreign direct investment and 

portfolio inflows. Public finances  
At 5.6% of GDP, the general government deficit in 
2004 is estimated to be sli
ghtly lower than expected in 
the previous Commission forecast. The downward 
revision of the deficit results from a better than 
expected performance of the Polish economy that 

translated into higher revenues. 
However, despite the fa
vourable cyclical situation, and a downward revision of the deficit for 2003, the 
deterioration of the general government deficit 

between 2003 and 2004 still 
represents 1.7 percentage 
points and reflects a substantial loosening of fiscal 
policy.  The projections for the def
icit in 2005 and in 2006 
have been revised downwards respectively to 4.1% 
and 3.1% of GDP resulting mainly from better 
8181Chapter 3   Member States, Poland
- 82 - 
cyclical conditions. The expected rebound in domestic 
demand would contribute to increased tax revenues. 
Additional measures contained in the draft budget for 

2005 have been incorporated in the forecast, provided 
that they have already been adopted or are being in 
the final stage of discussion in Parliament, and would 

further retrench expenditures and increase revenues 
over 2005 and 2006. These measures include in 
particular a change in pension indexation rules and a 

reform of defence spending. They would have a 
deficit-reducing impact of 
around 1 percentage point 
of GDP in 2005. A positive role will also be played 
by the net inflows of fu
nds from the EU budget. 
The primary balance is expected to improve after a 
considerable deterioration in 2004. The forecast still 
includes the surplus of the open pension funds, which 

is expected to reach appr
oximately 1.6% of GDP in 
2004, within the general government sector. 
As the borrowing needs of the government are 
expected to decrease, the gr
oss debt figures have been 
revised downwards. The improvement results also 
from better than previously expected privatization 
prospects. From 47.7% of GDP in 2004, the debt-to-

GDP ratio would increase to 50% in 2005. It would 
then slightly decrease to 49.3% by the end of 2006.

8220.Portugal
Coming out of the recession 
- 83 - 
Overall developments and prospects 
After the recession in 2003, when real GDP shrunk by 
1.2%, economic activity has been recovering, with 
solid growth in the first ha
lf of 2004. In the current 
year, internal demand has been leading the recovery, 
with gains in both private consumption and 
investment. GDP is expected 
to grow by 1.2% in real 
terms for the full year. 
For 2005, internal demand is expected to remain 
buoyant, with a slightly 
different composition, since 
private consumption growth is expected to slow down 
already in the course of the current year, while 
investment should recover strongly from the 

retrenchment of 2002 and 2003.  
Growth of Portuguese exports has been lively in 2004, 
but a slightly lower pace is foreseen for 2005 and 
2006. This is due to the demand slowdown expected 

in some of the country™s major trading partners and 
the lack of significant improve
ment in real unit labour 
costs in the manufacturing industry relative to other 

competitors. With respect to imports, the buoyant 
domestic demand has been leading to a strong 
rebound of imported 
goods in 2004.  
The combined effect of the projected export and 
import trends is a deterioration of Portugal™s external 
balance in 2004. As a share of GDP, the net 
borrowing of the economy is expected to stabilize in 

2005 and 2006. 
All in all, the main driving force of the economy over 
the forecast period is likely to be internal demand, 
while the external sector will provide only a minor 
contribution to growth. GDP growth is forecast at 
2.2% in 2005 and to slightly accelerate to 2.4% in 

2006. PricesThe economic downturn in 
2003 significantly eased 
pressure on prices and wages. Despite the recovery of 
internal demand, the persistence of a negative output 

gap is expected to contain inflation. High oil prices, 
also in 2006, coupled with increased economic 
activity, could, however, prevent the projected 
deceleration.Labour Market 
Unemployment has been on an ascending path since 
2000. The cyclical developments, which led to a sharp 

rise in unemployment in 2003, are now expected to 
prevent a further deterioration on the labour market. 
In 2004, the unemployment ra
te is forecast to stay 
flat. Only marginal reduc
tions are foreseen in 2005 
and 2006.  Public Finances 
In 2003, the government deficit stood at 2.8% of 
GDP. Since the economic recession severely hurt 

current tax revenues, the broadly stable deficit figure 
was achieved through two one-off operations worth 
together over 2% of GDP.  
In 2004, after taking into 
account the effects of the 
sale of tax arrears in the previous year, fiscal revenues 
have been growing above expectations, which can be 
partially ascribed to a stronger-than-expected 

recovery of internal demand. Even though 
developments on the revenue side will facilitate a 
reduction of the deficit, the expansion of public 
expenditures, both in real and nominal terms, will 
hamper further budgetary 
consolidation in 2004. 
Without further measures, a deficit clearly in excess 
of 3% of GDP would ensue. In order to bring it below 
that figure, the Portugues
e government is planning 
one-off operations: (i) the sale of real estate assets, 
currently scrutinized by Eurostat, shall generate 
revenues worth 0.8% of GDP; (ii) the transfer to the 

state sector of pension liabilities for four state-owned 
enterprises (SOE), with exp
ected proceeds of 1.2% of 
GDP. These operations are taken on board in the 

current forecast, which leads to an expected general 
government deficit of 2.9% of GDP.

The cyclical upturn projected for the next two years 
should facilitate budgetary co
nsolidation. However, 
under the assumption of no-policy change, there is a 

high risk that the pace of the economic recovery per 
se will not be enough to bring the general government 
deficit below the reference value of 3% of GDP. It 

shall be noted that as from 2005, the reduction of the 
corporate tax rate, from 30 to 25%, will have its full 
effect on the revenue side. All in all, the revenue and 

expenditure trends will lead to government deficits 
that, with high likelihood, will be in excess of 3% of 
GDP over the forecast period. For 2005, the 
Portuguese authorities are envisaging two revenue-
raising measures: (i) receiving a one-off payment of 

dividends, worth 0.5% of GDP, from a SOE, an 
operation that is being ex
amined by Eurostat; (ii) a 
lump-sum payment to the state sector, equal to 0.3% 
of GDP, in exchange of the responsibility for taking 
over pension liabilities of a SOE. After incorporating 
these two measures in the current forecast, and 

pending a final Eurostat 
decision, the government 
deficit for 2005 would come close to 3.7% of GDP. In 
2006, the deficit may go to 3.8%, assuming that all 

one-off measures are phased-out.  
The Portuguese government has stated its 
commitment to keep the deficit at or below 3% of 
GDP also in 2005. To this
 end, the government is 
envisaging further revenue-raising transitory 
measures. Since some of these measures have not 
been announced to a degree of precision that would 
allow their appropriate assessment, they are not 
included in the current forecast.

8421.Slovenia
Economy in a rebound 
- 85 - 
Recent developments and prospects for 2004   
In 2003, Slovenia™s real GDP growth decelerated to 
2.5%, the lowest rate since 1993, against a 
persistently bleak international environment. 

Economic performance has faltered as export growth 
slowed to 3.2% while imports rose by 6.8%. 
Consequently, the foreign demand contribution to 

GDP growth turned negative. In 2003, the push was 
mainly internal. Investment expenditure was booming 
at 10.5% and private spending rebounded to 2.7%, 

largely fuelled by high credit growth as real wages 
increased only moderately and employment fell again. 
The acceleration in government consumption having 
risen by 2.6% provided further stimulus to a 
continuous strengthening of domestic demand. With 

export activity improving steadily in relation to a 
gradual recovery in the EU, 
growth started to pick-up 
towards the end of 2003.   
This year, the economy appears to have caught a 
strong growth momentum, supported by export 
expansion, prolonged invest
ment surge, significant 
stock-building and marked household consumption. 

The upward trend in the quarterly dynamics of GDP 
components upholds the an
ticipation of a robust 
economic upturn, albeit much of the recent rise seems 

to have come from a considerable building up of 
inventories. In the first half of 2004 the economy 
grew by 4.2% compared to th
e same period last year, 
but is expected to slow 
down somewhat in the last 
two quarters, to reach 4.0% over the year as a whole. 
Outlook for 2005-2006  
For 2005, the forecast projects GDP growth to stay 
steady at 3.6% as the economy comes under a mild 
temporary strain of presently high commodity price 
levels, confirmed by wither
ing investors™ confidence. 
It is especially domestic consumption that is likely to 
drive the economy next year. Real wage increases are 
expected to be subdued, however, a gentle pick-up in 

employment and a new personal income tax regime 
should spur household spending. 
In 2006, when the negative effects of high oil prices 
are expected to gradually fade, growth should start 

accelerating again. All components should contribute 
to GDP growth, forecast at 3.8%, with domestic 
demand giving the main impetus. Underlying the 
modest upturn is the anticipation of buoyant 
consumption and investment against the background 

of vigorous construction 
activity, production capacity adjustments to enhance competitiveness and 
increasing exports. In step with strengthened domestic 

demand and exports, imports are also set to rise 
slightly. With a slowdown in the EU economy impinging on 
Slovenia™s exports, the current account surplus 

narrowed, moving closer 
to balance in 2003. A 
marginally negative current account is expected to 
deteriorate moderately in 2005 and 2006.   
Labour market, wages and prices 
In 2003, employment fell and unemployment 
increased. This year the unemployment rate is to 
return to past levels of 
slightly above 6% and then 
resume its gradual trend decline as GDP growth stays 

resilient.  In May 2004, a new wage agreement for the private 
sector was adopted, stipulating that pay should lag 

behind productivity growth by at least one percentage 
point. Furthermore, it introduced forward-looking 
indexation, which takes in
to account anticipated 
rather than actual domestic consumer price 
movements, inflationary expectations in the EU and 
the euro/tolar exchange rate. The indexation 

mechanism is similar to the 
one agreed for thepublic 
sector in July 2003 and is considered benign to the 
disinflationary process. 
Consumer price inflation has decreased impressively, 
dropping from 8.6% in 2001 to 5.7% in 2003 after the 
economic slowdown has eased the inflationary 

pressures. Inflation continued to decline rapidly in 
2004; in September, the 12-month moving average

rate of consumer price growth stood at 4.0%. The 
government exercised prudence in regulating 
administered price increases and indirect tax changes, 

as well as applied frequent adjustments of excise 
duties on oil to temper the impact of world market 
price fluctuations. Moreov
er, the Bank of Slovenia 
has geared its monetary po
licy towards slowing the 
depreciation of the currency until entering ERM II on 
28 June when the tolar was fixed at 239.64 tolars per 

1 euro within a +/- 15% fluctuation band. Ever since, 
the exchange rate has remained close to the central 
parity. Assuming anti-inflationary policies continue, 
while exchange rate stab
ility now credibly anchors 
expectations, inflation is projected to stay on a steady 

trend decline.Public finance 
A revision of the government accounts, linked to the 
sectoral re-classification of some public institutions, 
has raised the general government deficit figures for 
the period 2000-20
03 (by 0.2-0.5% of 
GDP). Within 
the new methodological framework, the projection 

foresees the deficit this year to worsen, arriving at 
2.3% of GDP, mostly as 
a result of subdued VAT 
revenue following the tax collection change after EU 

accession. The deficit is projected to remain broadly 
stable, declining marginally to 2.2% of GDP next 
year, as the decline in revenues due to the direct tax 
reform effective from January 2005 is compensated 
by an inflow of EU funds. Expenditure limits and 
changes of the indexation sy
stem, containing the rise 
of public sector wages and certain social transfers, are 
expected to help bring the 
deficit down to 1.9% of 
GDP in 2006.   Table 3.21

Domestic demand picks up
-87 - 
Growth in 2003 and in the first half of 2004  
In 2003, real GDP growth slightly decelerated to 4% 
and its composition turned around. Stellar export 
growth of almost 23% in 
real terms propelled the 
external growth contribution to 6½ percentage points 
Œ in spite of the lacklust
re performance of Slovakia™s 
main export markets. The domestic growth 

contribution became negativ
e. Private consumption 
expenditure was dampened significantly by real wage 
developments, resumed adjustments in administered 

prices and indirect taxes, and the implementation and 
anticipation of reforms in 
the social and health 
systems. Gross fixed capital formation contracted as 
well.The first half of 2004 witnessed a reversal of these 
trends, which had already star
ted in the fourth quarter 
of 2003, and the growth contributions of all domestic 
demand components entered into positive territory. In 
particular, private consumption picked up faster than 

had been commonly expected. This was partly due to 
a shift of some components of employees™ 
compensation from end-2003 to 2004 as a reaction to 

the introduction of lower income taxes (flat rate of 
19%). Export growth fell but remained robust at 16%, 
ensuring a continued pos
itive external contribution. Altogether, GDP growth for the first half of 2004 
reached almost 5½% (y-o-y). 
Growth prospects  
The immediate outlook for th
e Slovak economy is for 
a continuation of strong grow
th for the rest of 2004, 
leading to almost 5% growth for the year as a whole.

Slovakia - GDP 
growth and its contributors 
Private consumption is expected to stay strong as the 
increase of disposable income accelerates, with the 
income tax cuts outweighing
 restraints on social  
transfers and with real wage growth increasing. Gross 
fixed capital formation is likely to expand sharply as 
business environment and confidence have further 

strengthened and as the first tranches of pledged 
greenfield investments, 
predominantly in the 
automobile sector, are being implemented. The 

external growth contribution will weaken 
considerably but is expected to remain positive. 
In 2005, domestic demand growth is set to pick up 
further as private consumption expands in 
synchronization with higher real wages, a falling 
household savings rate an
d strong household credit 
growth and as FDI-induced
 gross capital formation 
peaks. The associated increase in imports of 
investment goods will contri
bute to a slightly negative 
external influence on 
GDP growth. The latter is 
expected to settle at around 4½%.  
In 2006, new export capacity
 will come on stream and 
the external growth contribution should become 

positive again. Moreover, domestic demand is 
expected to remain strong, although gross fixed 
capital formation is predicted to slow down. 

Altogether, GDP growth is predicted at a rate of more 
than 5%.  
InflationConsumer price headline inflation has been hovering 
around 8% in 2003 and 200
4, while core inflation 
stayed below or around 3%. This discrepancy has 
been due to still significant adjustments in 
administered prices and indirect taxes. As of 2005, 
such measures exert much less influence and there are 
reasonable prospects that 
headline inflation will rapidly fall to levels around 4% in 2005 and 3% in 
2006 Œ assuming that potenti
al second-round effects, 
including due to any back
ward-looking wage setting, 
are kept in check. 
Current account 
The current account deficit narrowed dramatically 
from around 8% of GDP in 2002 to roughly 1% of 
GDP in 2003, mirroring the impressive export 

performance of that year. Over the forecast horizon 
the deficit is expected to sl
ightly widen but to stay 
around 3% of GDP, with the trade balance remaining 

the main determinant.  
8787Chapter 3 Member States, Slovakia-88 - 
Labour market 
After a strong performance in 2003, employment 
expansion seems to have come to a halt in 2004 as 
economic restructuring continues. Employment is 

predicted to expand again in 2005 and 2006. Partly 
reflecting unemployment benefit reforms, the 
unemployment rate fell strongly
 in 2003 but is likely 
to rise again in 2004. A gradual reduction is likely 
over the rest of the forecast horizon.      
Public finances 
With a general government deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 
2003, the Slovak authorities substantially over- 
performed on their original target of 5% of GDP. 
The implementation of the budget 2004 reflects most 
of the government™s structur
al reform agenda for the 
current legislative period, bo
th on the revenue and 
expenditure side. This includes notably the 
introduction of a flat tax rate 
of 19% not only for the 
individual but also the corporate income tax, of a 
uniform 19% VAT rate, and of comprehensive 
reforms in the social sphere. So far, budget execution 

seems to be well on track an
d the government is likely 
to reach its target of a deficit slightly below 4% of 
GDP.  For the years 2005 and 2
006, the general government 
deficit is expected to stay 
basically flat Œ roughly in 
line with the government
™s objectives. The predicted 
deficit figures include the revenue-decreasing effects 
of the introduction of a mandatory funded pension 
pillar at the beginning of 20
05, which are estimated at 
almost ½ of a percentage point of GDP in the first 
year and nearly 1 percentage point of GDP in 2006.

Growth set to maintain strong momentum, increasingly supported by 
exports- 89 - 
Economic developments in 2004  
Following real GDP grow
th of 2.0% in 2003, 
economic activity expanded more strongly than 
anticipated, growing by 3.0% year-on-year in the first 

half of 2004. According to 
revised data, output grew 
by 1.1% in the first quarter from the previous period, 
owing mainly to continued strong household 

consumption and exports bei
ng boosted by cruise ship 
deliveries. In the second
 quarter, real GDP growth 
decelerated to 0.7%, even though investment 

increased strongly, with equipment investment up by 
4.9% on the quarter, as pr
ivate consumption remained 
flat and exports 
plunged by 5.1% from the previous 
quarter. Overall, it appears that domestic demand has 
propelled growth in the firs
t part of 2004, while the 
contribution from the extern
al side has been more 
subdued than expected. Household consumption was 
fuelled by earnings, direct and indirect tax cuts, and 

low interest rates, while 
public consumption has 
expanded only modestly, 
in line with expectations.  
Total investment has grown since summer 2003, 

confirming that a cyclical turnaround has taken hold. 
Residential construction and equipment investment 
have increased strongly, more than offsetting a further 

slump in commercial building. 
In first half of 2004, 
exports were boosted by cruise ship deliveries and 
strong demand for metal products, but overall exports 

have suffered from the diff
iculties in the electronics 
industry. Imports contracted in the first part of 2004, 
as fewer cars were imported 
to Finland than in 2003. 
The weakening in the terms 
of trade has continued as 
export prices remained broadly flat while import 
prices increased.   
In contrast to the stronger activity, employment has 
declined further, by 0.4% up to September 2004. 
Nevertheless, unemployment remained broadly stable 

as labour supply contracted 
as well. Inflation (HICP) 
declined from an average of 1.3% in 2003 to 0.2% in 
September 2004 on account of the alcohol tax cut 

taking effect in March.Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
The economy is projected to
 firmly remain on the 
growth path throughout the forecast period. Based on 
survey indicators, exports are expected to pick up 
during the latter part of 2004, while domestic demand 
will remain solid. In 
2005-06, net exports will 
increasingly contribute to growth, while support from 
private consumption will recede, but investment is 
expected to pick up the slack.  Consequently, activity 

is set to expand at a steady pace, peaking in 2005 at 
3.1% and then easing to 2¾% in 2006.  
Job creation is expected to pick up slightly as from 
2005, allowing some modest inroads into 

unemployment, which remains largely structural in 
nature.  GDP components  
Private consumption is expected to continue driving 
activity, although gains in disposable income will be 

lower as the temporary factors that supported 
purchasing power in 2004 
will fade away. In addition, 
higher inflation and increases in tax-like charges will 

dampen growth in real disposable income. Public 
consumption is expected to increase modestly, given 
the efforts of the central government at expenditure 
control. Investment has finall
y returned to the growth 
trend and, given the projected
 stronger stimulus from 
external demand and improving capacity utilisation, is 
projected to accelerate in 2005-2006.  
Exports are anticipated to strengthen on the back of 
the stable international economic outlook and to gain 

further momentum in 2006. In spite of the recent 
setbacks in the electronics industry, the prospects for 
exports of telecommunication equipment appear 

rather promising. Also the outlook for forest and 
metal industry exports is positive.

may rise to about 1.5%, as the economy expands and 
the effect of the tax cut fades away. The centralised 
two-year wage agreement that provides for general 

wage rises of 2.2% in 2004 will expire in February 
2005. Even though the 
outlook for 
new collective wage agreement seems currently rather bleak, the 

baseline assumption of the forecast is that wage rises 
will broadly follow the trend 
observed in recent years.  
Public finances  
The general government surplu
s is foreseen to remain 
unchanged from 2003 at 2.3% of GDP in 2004. 
Central government finances are expected to be in 
surplus, although they have been weakening for four 
consecutive years, while municipalities continue to 
stay in deficit. Based on the government™s medium-

term spending guidelines 
of Spring 2004 and the 
budget proposal for 2005, 
the general government 
surplus is estimated to s
tay over 2% of GDP during 
the forecast period. Central government finances are 
projected to be in deficit 
in 2005-06 as expenditures 
are rising at a faster pace than revenues. Moreover, 

local governments may stay in deficit, even if the 
financial position should improve due to higher tax 
receipts and moderate expenditure growth. Overall, 
the general government surplus will be largely 
accounted for by the social security funds. 
The government debt ratio is anticipated to fall from 
44.8% of GDP in 2004 to 
about 42% of GDP by the 
end of the forecast period.

9024.Sweden
The labour market revives in 2005 consolidating robust economic growth 
- 91 - 
The situation in 2004  
Swedish economic growth ha
s been strong in 2004, 
with GDP growth up by 3.7% on the year in the first 
half; growth accelerated from 0.9% in the first quarter 

to 1.0% in the second. Exports have expanded 
substantially, outpacing imports, resulting in a 
considerable growth contri
bution from net exports. 
On the domestic side, private consumption has 
advanced steadily and in the second quarter 
investment expansion was encouraging after a 

sustained period of slu
ggishness. Relatively poor 
developments observed in the labour market have 
helped to contain wage demands and inflationary 
pressures have been very 
low. The subdued outlook 
for inflation has enabled the Riksbank to extend its 
cycle of reducing interest rates, with further cuts in 
the repo-rate of 75 basis poin
ts in the first half of 
2004. Recent indicators are positive, with both consumers 
and business expectations at relatively high levels. 
The consumer confidence indicator has continued to 
show a positive picture. 
Business confidence 
indicators are similarly encouragin
g. The industrial 
confidence indicator has been rising since last autumn 
and stood clearly above its long-term average in 

September. The purchasing managers index also 
signals expansion. These prospects are expected to be 
confirmed in a steady continuation of the recovery in 

the remainder of 2004, w
ith GDP growth of 3.7%. In 
particular the external side is expected to contribute 
very strongly to growth this year. 
Disposable income growth has strengthened in 2004 
compared with 2003, providing for continued steady 
increase in private consumption. The saving rate of 
households, though remaining above 10%, is expected 

to be lower in 2004 co
mpared with 2003. Financial 
wealth has benefited from rising equity prices. 
Moreover, while households have taken on more debt, 

house prices have continued to rise steadily, 
contributing to the mainte
nance of a relatively strong net wealth position of households. 
Prospects for 2005-06 
A resumption of employment growth contributes 
positively to household disposable income in 2005 
and more significantly so
 in 2006. An additional 
modest reduction of the saving rate is expected in 
2005. All in all, this 
should result in stable 
consumption growth in the years to 2006. Public 

consumption is expected to continue to be relatively 
steady over the forecast period. Turning to 
investment, the conditions for 
a strong recovery are in 
place: a benign demand outlook, favourable financing 
conditions, a long 
period of falling total investments 
and a high capacity utilisation rate in manufacturing. 

A strong investment expansion should therefore take 
place over the forecast period. Exports are expected to 
continue to grow relatively strongly up to 2006, in 

line with world markets. Imports should expand more 
rapidly as final demand strengthens further during the 
forecast period. In 2005, economic growth is expected 

to be 3.1%, above the po
tential rate, driven by 
domestic demand. In 2006, the economy is expected 
to grow almost as fast, close to the potential rate. 
With a relatively strong GD
P evolution over this 
period, interest rates may rise slightly.  
Labour market, costs and prices  
Employment growth has been negative in 2004 and 
the unemployment rate has ri
sen. The strong rise in 
economic activity foreseen from 2004 onwards is 
expected to result in an 
improvement in the labour 
market in 2005 and in par
ticular in 2006. Inflation has 
fallen considerably since electricity and energy price 
increases in late 2003, notwithstanding the significant 
recent rises in oil prices. Wages are expected to rise 
relatively moderately, reflecting past weakness in the 
labour market. The wage agreements reached in the 

spring of 2004 resulted in lower negotiated wage rises 
in industry  compared with the 2001 wage negotiation

round. Against this backgrou
nd, inflationary pressures 
should be subdued this year. As demand and growth 
revive further in 2005 and 
2006, inflation is expected 
to rise gradually to 2% during the course of 2006. 
With relatively strong grow
th over this period, and 
with an improvement in 
the labour market from next 
year, interest rates may start to rise. 
Public finances  
In 2004, the surplu
s in public finances is expected to 
rise to slightly above 0.5% of GDP. Income tax cuts 
in 2005 proposed 
in the Budget Bill, one part of the 
last step of a phased income tax reform, contributes to 
keep the surplus ratio in the government finances 
unchanged in 2005. On current policies, a slight rise 
in the budget balance is projected in 2006, compared 

with the previous year, benefiting also from an 
improvement in the labour market. General 
government debt, which mainly lies in central 

government, is projected to rise as central government 
is expected to remain in deficit over the forecast 
period. The increase is nevertheless slower than 

nominal GDP over the forecast period, resulting in a 
fall in the debt ratio to close
 to 50% of GDP in 2006.

9225.United Kingdom 
Growth moderating, but remaining strong - 93 - 
The situation in 2004 
Output growth in the UK in 2004 has been robust. 
Momentum throughout the second half of 2003 has 
been sustained, resulting in 
a 3.6% expansion over the 
year to the second qu
arter of 2004, well above 
estimates of the trend rate of growth.  
Domestic demand has been the key driver of this 
performance. Private consumption expenditure has 

again been a significant source of growth, along with 
supportive government cons
umption Œ the latter the 
result of a sustained programme of government 
spending aimed at improv
ing public services. In 
addition, the pickup in fi
xed investment observed 
during the second half of 2003 has continued apace 
following improvements in corporate profitability. A 
sustained appreciation of the sterling effective 

exchange rate, through the 
second half of 2003 and 
into March 2004 appears to have dampened any 
further stimulus from growth in export volumes, but a 

more recent, smaller depreciation over the summer 
may yet help the UK™s expo
rt performance in the later 
part of the year, particu
larly in the face of the 
expected wider global recovery.  
As in 2003, growth has been strongest in the service 
and construction sectors. After four consecutive 
quarters of expansion, manufacturing output fell 

slightly in the first quarte
r, in apparent contradiction 
with survey evidence repo
rting an improving outlook. 
In the second quarter, however, quarter-on-quarter 

growth of 1.2% in manufacturing output once again 
suggested that recovery 
was still in progress. Unemployment has remained at record-low levels, 
falling to 4.7% in September 2004. Notwithstanding 
the strength of the labour market, and a pickup in 
average earnings, inflationary pressures have 

appeared subdued, with the harmonised index of 
consumer prices (known in the UK as CPI) remaining 
well below the Bank of England™s symmetric 2% 

inflation target throughout the year. The Bank™s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has, in 
anticipation of emerging price pressures, already 

raised its policy interest rate by 25bp on 4 occasions 
during 2004 Œ resulting in 
a cumulative rise in the 
repo rate of 125bp to 4.
75% since its trough in 
November 2003. 
For 2004 as a whole, it is now estimated that growth 
is likely to be around 3.3%, above the Commission™s 

spring forecast of 3.0%. 
 Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Firm growth is expected 
to continue throughout the 
forecast period, moderating slightly to around 2¾% in 
both 2005 and 2006. Final domestic demand should 

weaken in 2005 and 2006, as
 the impact of tighter 
monetary policy takes effect, while improved world 
demand is expected to lead to a small positive 

contribution to growth from
 net exports in 2005.  
Household consumption in real terms is expected to 
slow to around 2¼% in 20
05 and a little less in 2006 - 
following interest rate rises, this also reflects the 
impact of an expected slowing in house price 
inflation. Signs of a cooling housing market are 
becoming more evident, with recent slowdowns in 

lending and mortgage approvals. However, the overall 
impact  on  consumption  from  slower  house  price

- 94 - 
growth is expected to 
be relatively mild, especially 
since household net wealth 
holdings are still healthy. 
The build-up in household debt in recent years is not 

regarded as a major risk: most appears to have been 
used either to invest in housing improvements (i.e. re-
invested in the housing market), or the acquisition of 

financial assets, rather than
 to finance consumption. 
The strength of the labour 
market should also provide 
further support to
 household confidence in the event 
of a more marked downturn in the housing market. 
All in all, the saving ratio should rise gently over the 
forecast period.  
Government consumption in line with the 
government™s plans will support growth throughout 
the forecast period. Fixed investment should moderate 

slightly from robust growth
 in 2004, but will remain 
strong Œ also reflecting gove
rnment plans to increase 
public investment Œ with slower construction 

investment offset, particularly in 2005, by continued 
firm growth in equipment investment. 
The strength of recovery in the global economy 
should contribute to an improvement in UK net 

exports, despite the strength of equipment investment 
helping to sustain demand for imports.  Net exports 
should contribute positively 
to output growth in 2005, 
with the net trade contribu
tion returning to around 
balance in 2006 as global demand slows. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Unemployment is expected to remain low and stable 
at around 5%, close to its estimated NAIRU level, 

throughout the forecast period. Employment growth 
should be more moderate than in recent years, as 
employment levels are already relatively high by 
international standards. Wage
 growth should increase 
given the strength of the la
bour market, particularly as 
bonus payments are increasingly likely to reflect 
improvements in corpora
te profitability. With 
productivity growth expected
 to remain firm, unit 
labour cost increases should be moderate. 
Pressure on consumer prices should also increase; 
although signs of a pic
kup in inflation are muted 
despite recent oil price rises, with HICP inflation only 

1.1% in the year to Sept
ember 2004, it is expected to 
rise towards its 2% target by the end of 2005, not least 
as signs of emerging pressu
re in producer prices are 
evident. Some further tig
htening of monetary policy 
by the authorities is commonly expected. 
Public finances 
The general government finances recorded a deficit of 
3.3% of GDP in 2003, significantly higher than had 
been forecast by the authorities in April 2003. 

Composition effects in GDP growth resulted in lower-
than-expected receipts from taxes on corporate 
income and wages and salaries. Further, there were 

additional discretionary expenditure related to the Iraq 
war and measures to combat terrorism. 
So far in 2004, data suggest some improvement in the 
first half of the year, but considerable uncertainty 
hangs over future developments. The deficit is 
expected to narrow over the forecast period, with 

growth in general government consumption projected 
to slow relative to 2004, and revenues to recover 
relative to nomin
al income.  
Revenues, particularly taxes on household income and 
corporate profits, sh
ould increase as a result of still 
relatively strong GDP growth, albeit at a slower pace 
than was forecast by the au
thorities in the March 2004 
Budget. However, risks to this forecast remain 
significant, because of a hi
gh degree of uncertainty 
over the future development of tax revenues. Under 

the UK™s system of corporation tax, in particular, 
companies pay on the basis of expected profits for the 
year, but are not penalised 
for underestimating profit 
in the early part of the year. Thus, while higher 
corporate profitability should soon begin to feed 
through into tax receipts, data so far give little guide 

to the likely development of receipts in the fourth 
quarter of this year. 
On the expenditure side, growth of government 
spending is expected to slow, broadly in line with the 
plans set out by the government in the Budget. 
Historically, there has been a tendency to underspend 

relative to target, but in a period of slowing 
expenditure, government departments may find it 
more difficult to adjust 
to tighter budgets. Indeed, 
expenditure in 2004 has been relatively strong so far; 
while it is difficult to draw
 conclusions about the 
likely path of expenditure from these developments, 

there remains some risk, therefore, that government 
spending will be higher than is currently forecast. 
.94Chapter 3   Member States, United Kingdom
- 95 - 
In order to strengthen 
efforts to improve public 
services as the rate of e
xpenditure increase slows, the 
authorities announced plan
s in summer 2004 to 
significantly enhance efficiency across the public 
sector (including through so
me cuts in employment). 
However there is not expected to be any net impact on 

the public finances, since the government has stated 
that any expenditure savings are to be redirected to 
priority areas. 
In total, the projected def
icit declines to a little below 
3% of GDP in 2004 and to around 2½% in both 2005 
and 2006. The ratio of gr
oss debt to GDP, though 
increasing slightly, is expected to remain close to 
40%. However, as noted 
above, considerable 
uncertainty remains over the fu
ture path of the deficit. 
Risks remain and a deficit figure higher than 3% in 
2004 can not be excluded.

9595Chapter 4 Candidate Countries 971.Bulgaria
 Continuing high growth on the basis of strong domestic demand 
- 98 - 
Recent economic developments 
The Bulgarian economy continued its expansion at a 
rate of 5.6% in the first half of 2004. Growth is based 
on strong domestic demand fuelled by increases in net 

income, employment and bank credit. While this 
results in high import growth, exports were also 
getting stronger over the summer. On the supply side, 

the good harvest, a strong increase in industrial 
production and a good tourism season are contributing 
to the high output growth. 
Following a period of low inflation in the first months 
of 2003, rates have accelerated since mid-2003 due to 
higher food prices, as a consequence of a drought-

related bad harvest in 2003, as well as increases in 
excise tax rates, administrative prices and import 
prices. Unemployment decreased to 12.0% in June 

2004 since jobs are being created in the private sector 
and in government schemes for long-term 
unemployed. The current 
account deficit, which had 
deteriorated to 8.6% of GDP in 2003, showed an 
improvement in the first seven months of 2004 in all 
its balances except for the tr
ade deficit. Net inflows of 
foreign direct investment in
 2004 were at record highs 
and fully covering the current account deficit. 
Prospects for 2004 to 2006  
GDP growth is expected to achieve around 5½% for 
the full year 2004, to accelerate to a rate of 6% in 

2005 and to moderate to 4½% in 2006. The 
acceleration in 2004 and 2005 will be based on 
continued strong domestic demand resulting in a 

highly imbalanced growth composition. In 2005,

growth will be further stimulated by already 
announced measures of slightly expansionary fiscal 
and wage policies in view of national elections by 

mid-2005. This is likely 
to be followed by some 
adjustment in 2006 to re
balance the economy and to bring it closer to its medium-term potential growth 

rate.The projected growth path, driven by a similar 
development of domestic demand and, on the supply 
side, a good performance of all three broad sectors, 

will continue to trigger substantial imports given the 
still weak industrial base of the economy. Private 
consumption will remain very strong because of high 
credit growth, higher employment and increases in net 
income, the latter also arisi
ng from cuts in income tax 
rates and a 25% increase in the minimum wage 
planned for 2005. These effects on consumption are 
likely to moderate in 2006
, but strong investment in 
view of the opportunities expected from EU accession 
in 2007 should prevent the economy from a more 
significant slowdown. Net exports have a strongly 

negative contribution to GDP growth until becoming 
less negative in 2006 as a result of a slower expansion 
of private consumption. 
Consumer price inflation is expected to be lower in 
the second half of 2004 than 
in the first half of the 
year, largely because of a better harvest which keeps 
food prices low. However, it is unlikely to be below 

5% at the end of the year and 6% on average also 
because of the higher oil price. Wage increases 
beyond what is warranted 
by productivity growth are 
likely to bring some upward pressure on prices in 
2005. These effects should ease in 2006, but catching-

up effects will make it diff
icult to achieve 
an average 
inflation rate of less than 4%. 
In view of continuing high GDP growth, net 
employment gains would make an unemployment rate 

of 10% or lower possible in 
2006. This assumes that 
the induced increase in the 
participation rate is likely 
to be higher than the d
ecline in the working-age 
population. Public finance 
In view of the strong revenue performance in the first 
eight months of 2004, the forecast projects that the 

general  government  budget 
 balance  will  achieve  a 
98Chapter 4 Candidate countries, Bulgaria
- 99 - 
surplus of ½% of GDP at the end of the current year. 
The expected deficit in 2005 of -1% of GDP is taking 
account of plans to further reduce tax rates on 

corporate profits and personal income. The 
continuation of a primary surplus and of high GDP 
growth will further reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over 

the forecasting horizon to a more sustainable level. 
External balancesThe deficit of the trade balance is expected to widen 
further until 2005 as a resu
lt of higher import prices 
and strong domestic demand. It is projected to 
decrease in 2006 due to mo
re favourable terms of 
trade and a gradual improvement in competitiveness 

arising from high fixed inve
stment for several years. 
As a consequence, the current account deficit is 
forecast to remain high until 2005 and to drop more 
significantly only in 2006
. Favourable developments 
in tourism, debt service obligations and EU transfers 
will improve the income, 
services and current 
transfers balances, respectively, and partly dissociate 

the performance of the current account deficit from 
that of the trade deficit. Net foreign direct investment 
is likely to fully cover the current account deficit in 

2004 since further inflows related to some major 
privatisations can be expect
ed until the end of the 
year.  Table 4.1

99992.Croatia 
 Weaker domestic demand and stronger foreign demand 
- 100 - 
Recent economic developments  
In the first half of 2
004, the Croatian economy 
expanded at a rate of 4%, somewhat lower than the 
4.3% increase in 2003 as a whole. As a result of 

tighter monetary policies, growth of domestic demand 
decelerated from 6% in 2003 to 4%. The contribution 
of gross fixed capital formation to growth declined 

from 4% to 2% in the same period, due to the gradual 
termination of public investment projects. Net 
external demand continued to be a drag on economic 

output, although to a lesser extent as compared to 
2003, pointing to a gradually improving performance 
of exports of goods and se
rvices. On the supply side, 
industrial output growth 
decelerated from a strong 
5.6% year on year in the first quarter to a modest 

2.2% in the second quarter. 
Average consumer price inflation increased to 2.3% 
in the second quarter compared to 1.8% in 2003 as a 
whole, mainly as a result of 
higher prices for housing, 
energy and transport. Labour force survey data point 
to an unemployment rate
 of 14.5% in 2003.   
During the first eight m
onths of 2004, merchandise 
exports expanded by 14%, while imports grew by 6%. 

As a result of such improved export performance, the 
trade and current account deficits narrowed during the 
first half of 2004. The trade deficit stood at 26.3% of 

GDP compared to 27.4% in 2003 as a whole. In the 
twelve months to June, the current account recorded a 
deficit of 6.5% of that period™s GDP, down from 7% 

of GDP in 2003.   
Prospects  
In 2004, real GDP growth is expected to decline to 
3.8%, as a consequence of the continuation of tight 
monetary policies curtailing credit growth and 

domestic demand. The growth rate is forecast to 
accelerate to 4% in 2005 and to 4.5% in 2005, based 
on the assumption of ongoing privatisation and 

restructuring in the industry
 and tourism sector and a 
generally positive external environment. 
Private consumption growth is expected to decelerate 
in 2004 to 3.5%, but will gr
adually increase to 4.2% 
in 2006. Gross fixed investment will grow by 7.3% 
this year, down from the exceptional high rate of 

almost 17% in 2003, reflecting slowing public 
investments. Investment growth is forecast to further 
decline to 5.4% and 4%
 in 2004 and 2005, 
respectively.  Real export growth is expected to 
accelerate on the back of stronger external demand, 
market share gains, and a strong performance of the 

tourism sector. Real imports are expected to grow at 
lower, but still increasing rates, reflecting moderate 
domestic demand growth and a relatively high import 

content of merchandise and services exports.  
Accordingly, the contribution to GDP growth is 
expected to change over the forecast period, reflecting 
weaker domestic and stronger net foreign demand. 

The contribution of domestic demand falls from 6.5% 
to a still strong 3.7% in both 2005 and 2006. The 
effect on growth of the foreign balance is neutral in 

2004. Net exports will cont
ribute positively to growth 
in 2005 with 0.5%, and with 0.9% 
in 2006. Annual average consumer price inflation is expected 
to remain below 3% over the forecast horizon, as 
pressures from domestic demand remain moderate. It 
will increase from 2.4% in 200
4 to 2.8% in 2006 as a 
result of administrative price adjustments, higher 
indirect taxes and price increas
es of non-tr
adables. In 
view of the accelerating GDP growth, employment is 

forecast to increase by around 1% per year over the 
forecast period. This supports a gradual reduction of 
the unemployment rate
 to 13.2% in
 2006.  
Public finances  
The general government deficit is expected to be 
reduced from the unexpected high 6.3% deficit in 
2003 to around 4.5% in 
2004. The reduction will be

mainly brought about by 
announced one-off measures 
on the revenue side.  
The forecast assumes a further reduction of the 
government deficit to 3.9% in 
2005 and 3.6% in 2006, 
in line with the governmen
t strategy to reduce the 
domestic savings-investment gap of the economy 
through a policy of fiscal 
consolidation. From 2005 
on, the adjustment is expected to take place 
predominantly on the expend
iture side. Cost savings 
will arise from ongoing health sector reform, a 

downsizing of personnel in 
public administration, and 
enhanced financial discipline of public enterprises. 
Envisaged tax reforms are expected to be largely 
revenue-neutral.   
As a result of fiscal consolidation, the government 
debt-to-GDP ratio will decline from 52.7% in 2004 to 

51.1% of GDP in 2006.    
External balancesThe trade balance is expected to slightly improve over 
the forecast period as a result of accelerating export 
growth, weaker domestic demand and an 

improvement in the terms of trade. The trade deficit in 
2004 will decline to 26
.9% of GDP and further 
improve in 2005 and 2006. The current account 

deficit is forecast to be gradually reduced from 7% of 
GDP in 2003 to a more sustainable level of 5.0% at 
the end of the forecast period. This is mainly 

explained by an improved performance of services 
exports, mainly tourism, 
which are projected to 
increase by a real 10% per year in both 2005 and 
2006.    Table 4.2

1011013.Romania
 In the high gearŒ buoyant demand and widening trade deficit  
- 102 - 
Recent economic developments 
In 2003, Romania™s four-year old economic recovery 
continued, as real GDP grew by 4.9%. However, 
growth was increasingly unbalanced and mainly 

driven by domestic demand. Household consumption 
rose strongly by 7.1%, driven by surging consumer 
credit and high wage growth.  With a real growth of 

4.6%, government consum
ption also expanded 
considerably. Gross fixed capital formation increased 
rapidly at 9.2%, pointing to the ongoing replacement 

of Romania™s capital stock. This strong domestic 
demand led to a sustained import growth of 16.3%, 
while export growth decelerated, reaching 11.1% for 
the year. Consequently, net exports turned strongly 
negative during 2003, and th
e current account deficit 
widened significantly to 5.8% of GDP.  
During the first half of 
2004, preliminary figures 
show that GDP grew by 6.6% y-o-y. Growth was 
driven by a further stre
ngthening of household 
consumption to 9% y-o-y, on the back of high real 
wage gains, and by strong gross fixed capital 
formation of 10.4% y-o-y. Although exports 

accelerated to a double-digit growth rate, they 
continue to be outpaced by rapid import growth of 
both consumer and investment goods. As a result, the 

trade deficit widened further.  
Prospects for 2004-06  
The outlook for the Romanian economy points to 
strong growth, a further decline in inflation and a 
considerable, but stable,
 current account deficit. 
Relative to the Spring 2004 
forecast, a remarkably 
good harvest as well as the acceleration of both 

domestic and external demand cause an upward 
revision of GDP growth for 2004. Growth is expected 
to gradually moderate over 2005 and 2006 on the 

back of a less favourable external environment as well 
as more subdued gove
rnment and household 
consumption.  
GDP growth and components 
For 2004, real GDP growth is expected to accelerate 
to 7.2% on the back of buoyant domestic demand and 
high agricultural output. Ho
usehold consumption is 
forecasted to expand by 8.0% in 2004 due to high real 
wage growth, a permanent effect on disposable 
income from lower social se
curity contributions and a 
surge in the rural 
population™s own co
nsumption as a 
result of the good harvest. In 2005 and 2006, private 
consumption is expected to decelerate due to the 

impact of energy price hikes on real disposable 
income
,a tighter fiscal stance and slower consumer 
credit growth. Investment growth is expected to 

remain strong at around 10% annually over the 
forecasting period due to the ongoing modernisation 
of production facilities, a st
ructural change towards 
less labour-intensive pr
oduction and ambitious 
motorway projects. Export 
growth, increasing inflows 
of FDI and improved access to financing will also 

support investments. The negative contribution to 
GDP growth from net exports 
is expected to diminish 
as growth slows. InflationInflation is expected to remain on a downward path. 
The continued fall in consumer price inflation is 
underpinned by a moderation of inflationary 

expectations in the economy and supported by a 
coherent policy mix. Productivity gains due to 
industrial restructuring and investments as well as a 

lower rate of depreciation of the 
lei are expected to 
contribute to further mitigati
ng inflationary pressures. 
Higher global energy prices are expected to 

increasingly feed through from producer to consumer 
prices. In combination with the ongoing adjustment of 
administered energy end-user prices and robust 

economic activity, this may cause inflation to decline 
at a slowing pace in 2005-06.

Labour market 
The unemployment rate is expected to remain 
stable at around 6.6% agains
t the background of 
slowly falling employment and declining labour 

market participation. Grow
th in private sector 
employment will continue to mitigate the effect 
from lay-offs caused by th
e restructuring of state-
owned enterprises, but the relatively low 
unemployment rate may come to an end as 
economic restructuring, including in the agricultural 

sector, deepens. Labour market trends should be 
interpreted with caution as data are affected by 
revisions and chan
ging methodology. 
Public finances 
Against the background of 
strong revenue growth, 
the fiscal policy stance was adjusted by two 
supplementary budg
ets in July and August 2004, 
bringing the 2004 general 
government deficit target  
for 2004 down to 1.6% of 
GDP from the originally 
budgeted 3.0% of GDP. This target is expected to 
be met. In 2005, the fiscal stance is expected to 

adjust to the need of containing the current account 
deficit, while still benefiting from significant 
revenue growth. On ba
lance, however, the 
introduction of important ta
x cuts is expected to 
lead to an increasing general government deficit. 
External balances Buoyant private consumption and investment 
activity will continue to drive imports up and result 
in a persistent trade deficit. Increasing transfers will 
mitigate the impact on the current account deficit, 

which is expected to remain stable over the 
forecasting period. Increasing FDI inflows, 
improved access to international financial markets 

and large international reserves will facilitate the 
financing of the deficit.

1031034.Turkey 
 Reaping the benefits of improved stability 
- 104 - 
Recent economic developments  
In 2003 the Turkish economy grew by 5.8%. During 
the first half of 2004, ec
onomic activity has continued 
to accelerate. Private consumption and investment 

showed an impressive boom,
 leading to an output 
increase by nearly 12%, compared to some 6% in the 
same period a year ago.  The main underlying factors 

for this strong expansion have been improved political 
stability - fostering, consumer and business 
confidence - and a favourable economic environment 

with declining inflation and interest rates, rapidly 
expanding consumer credits
, tax incentives
 to scrap 
old cars and a strong curre
ncy, supporting the import 
of consumer durables and in
vestment goods. Overall, 
the surge in investment has recently brought capital 

formation back to its pre-cr
ises level of 1998. Even 
when taking into account a deceleration in the second 
half of 2004, annual GDP 
growth will remain strong 
at about 8
½% in 2004.  
Disinflation has remained stronger than expected, 
with a decline in 12-months
 consumer price inflation 
from some 25% for the average of 2003 to around 

10% in autumn 2004. Wage restraint and the strength 
of the Turkish lira have helped to reduce inflation.  
The acceleration in domestic demand has led to a 
deterioration in the external accounts. In the first half 

of 2004, the current acc
ount deficit increased to EUR 
8 billion, nearly the double of the value in the same 
period in 2003. Strong tourism receipts, traditionally 

peaking in the third quarter, are expected to somewhat 
mitigate the effect of 
rapidly rising imports.

 Turkey - GDP growth 
 %Government finances have continued to improve in 
2003 and the first half of 2004. The general 
government balance (in ESA 95 terms) reached 8.7% 

of GDP in 2003. Revenues benefited from strong 
growth, while expenditures were largely kept in line 
with budgetary targets.  
So far, labour markets have hardly reacted to the 
increasing momentum in GDP growth. The number of 
employed persons has remained unchanged when 
compared to the first h
alf of last year, while the 
number of unemployed persons has declined only 
marginally. As a result, the unemployment ratio was 
around 10% in the fi
rst half of 2004. 
Prospects for 2004 to 2006  
After the strong growth in the first half of the year, 
the whole of 2004 will s
ee a very strong average 
growth of around 8.5%. 
In 2005 and 2006, the 
Turkish economy is expected to continue its catching 
up process, by realising relatively high growth. Thus, 
output growth at some 5% in 2005 and 2006 appears 

possible, reaping the benef
its of improved political 
and economic stability. These rates would bring 
Turkey closer to its long-term potential growth rates.  
Like in 2004, private consumption and fixed capital 
formation will be the main sources of growth over the 
forecast horizon. After years of postponed investment, 
substantial efforts are required to modernise and to 

deepen the capital stock. Increasing FDI inflows are 
expected to support the modernisation process. 
However, in view of the investment need, the bulk of 

investment will have to come from domestic sources. 
Overall, investment growth is expected to remain 
above 10% per year over the forecast horizon.  
In the remaining part 
of 2004, increasing 
administrated prices, seasonal factors and higher than 
expected energy prices are likely to slightly increase 

inflationary pressures. However, the authorities™ end-
year target of 12% seems to be within reach. The 
decline in inflation is likely 
to continue over the next 
two years, based on declining inflationary 
expectations, moderate wage growth and fiscal 
discipline. In such a scenario, consumer price 
inflation could decline to w
ell below 8% by 2006.  
104Chapter 4 Candidate countries, Turkey
- 105 - 
After years of labour shedding, the Turkish economy 
will finally start to increase its employment by some 
3% annually in 2005 and 2006. However, the 

unemployment rate is likely 
to remain high, as the 
projected job creation might just be enough to 
compensate Turkey™s strong 
growth in labour supply.  Public finances and current account  
With the presently strong revenue growth, reaching 
the primary surplus target of 6.5% of GDP (according 
to GFS accounting) 
for 2004 appears to
 be feasible.  
This would translate in a general government deficit 
(in ESA 95 terms) of 7.2%. This deficit is forecast to 
fall further during 2005-2006 the forecast horizon, to 

about 5% in 2006. Continued fiscal discipline and 
declining financing costs will be key in this respect. 
Significant primary surpluses and strong nominal 

GDP growth will help to reduce the general 
government gross debt ratio to around 70% of GDP in 
2006. However, as a result of the declining impact of 
nominal GDP growth on the debt ratio, achieving 
primary surpluses will be increasingly important for 

maintaining the downward tren
d in the debt ratio.   
The external accounts are likely to register significant 
deficits in 2005 and 2006. As a result of buoyant 
domestic demand, strong import growth will lead to a 

widening trade deficit, to some 10% of GDP by 2006. 
Export growth is expected
 to remain high, although 
the liberalisation of textile tr
ade in 2005 will bring 
additional competition from low wage countries, such 
as China, for one of Turkey™s most prominent export 
categories.However, a surge in service 
exports, mainly tourism, 
will help to maintain the current account deficit at 
sustainable levels, falling from around 5% of GDP in 

2004 to 4% in 2006.

Growth continues at a lower rate - 108 - 
Growth moderating to long-term trend in 2004 
Helped by expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, 
the US economy experienced a growth spurt in the 
year to the first quarter
 of 2004, which lifted real 
output by 5%. In the second quarter, however, private 
consumption softened in the context of rising energy 
prices and diminishing e
ffects of the fiscal and 
monetary stimuli injected in 2001-2003. Investment 
activity on the other hand
 continued to expand 
briskly, much helped by strong business profitability 

and favourable financial conditions. Although the 
third quarter has again been somewhat stronger, GDP 
growth in 2004 seems to be
 trending down to its 
estimated long-term potential of 3-3½%. 
Headline inflation became somewhat elevated in the 
first half of 2004 in the wa
ke of surging prices for oil 
and other commodities. Core 
inflation too rose above 
the long-time lows of lat
e 2003. However both measures have fallen back again in the third quarter 

and inflation expectations have remained well 
contained. Unemployment has drifted lower over the 
past year to an average rate of 5.4% in the third 

quarter, although employment growth has been 
relatively modest considering 
the present phase of the 
business cycle. The manufacturing capacity utilization 
rate has remained well below its long-term average, 
indicating that considerable slack remains in the 
economy. Productivity growth
 has receded from the 
extraordinary pace of the previous two years: output 
per hour in non-farm business fell back to an annual 
rate of 2.5% in the second quarter. The current 
account has worsened further this year resulting in net 
borrowing equal to 5.4% of GDP in the second 
quarter. The fiscal deficit 
of general government has 
fallen slightly to 4.4% of GDP in the second quarter 

of 2004 thanks to a favourable cyclical effect. 
Household and business spending under pressure
Looking forward, continued output growth in the 3-
3½% range would, first and foremost, require that 

households continue to ex
pand their consumption by 
at least 3% annually in real terms. This seems to be a 
tall order given the strain
ed state of household 
balance sheets. Certainly disposable incomes are now 
benefiting from employment growth and some wage 
acceleration, but they are unlikely to be boosted any 
further by tax cuts (although the recent extension of 
previous tax cuts will at leas
t prevent a negative effect 
on disposable incomes from the fiscal side). The 
forecast projects, therefore, that the household 
sector™s disposable income will continue to increase at 

around 5½% as in the first 
half of 2004. This implies 
that a 3% growth rate for real personal consumption 
expenditure can only be achieved if the household 

saving rate does not rise from its current historic low 
of less than 1% of disposable income. However, 
households will probably 
only maintain such a low 
savings rate if their balance sheets continue to benefit 
from rising house prices (9.4
% over the past year) and 
interest rates stay the same or decrease.  
Business investment is unlikely to continue to grow at 
the very fast rate of the past year because profit 
margins will suffer from weaker productivity growth 
and a firmer labour market. The lower rate of 
productivity growth observed 
this year seems to be 
the typical cyclical downturn 
in a maturing expansion. 
It is anticipated that this 
will be sustained throughout 
the forecast period. It is also assumed that hourly 
earnings will grow somewhat faster than in the early 

phase of the expansion. Consequently, unit labour 
costs will rise more substa
ntially, resulting in lower 
profits in 2005 and 2006.  
External trade has exerted a major drag on economic 
growth for a long time. Net exports are also expected 
to make a negative contribution to GDP growth in 
2005 and 2006 (see graph). 
However the trade deficit should stabilize as a share of GDP in this period in 
view of the lagged effects of the dollar depreciation in 
2002-03, moderating domestic demand and strong 

world growth.

Considering the remaining slack in the economy, 
underlying inflation should 
remain relatively benign, 
although the headline figure 
will be in the 2-3% range 
this year and next. Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Growth in the third quarter
 of 2004 should still be 
rather high, but for subsequent quarters a deceleration 
to the 2½-3% range is pr
ojected. The annual growth 
rates should reach 3% in 2005 and 2.9% in 2006. 
Apart from the growth-depressing effects of the 
higher oil price, this projection is based on the 
assumption that households will increase their savings 
rate gradually to 2% by 2006, 
as interest rates stay the 
same or increase and gains in property values 
moderate. Investment activity, 
particularly  residential  
construction, is also expected to slow. Employment 
should advance at a relatively modest pace with the 
unemployment rate staying stable. 
Household balance sheets constitute the main 
downside risk
The major risk associated with this forecast stems 
from the household balance sheet situation. If capital 
gains on existing assets, primarily houses, were to fall 

more sharply or even discontinue completely, 
households might cut back drastically on consumption 
to limit an undesired fall in
 the ratio of their net 
wealth to disposable inco
me. Such a development 
could cause a recession. Monetary and fiscal policies 

have much less room for manoeuvre to counter a 
consumer retrenchment now than during the 
slowdown in 2001.

1091092. Japan Recovery continues, but at a more subdued pace 
- 110 - 
Continued strong output expansion in 2004 
The economic recovery in Japan has become fairly 
broad-based, supported not only by external demand 
but also by structural improvements in the corporate 

and the financial sectors.  
According to national accounts data, output expansion 
in the Japanese economy slowed down to 1.3% 
(annualised) in the second qua
rter of this year, a sharp 
deceleration from the 6.2% registered in the first 
quarter. However, there are several reasons why the 
actual slowdown in growth is likely to be less marked 
than suggested by the official figures. Firstly, several 
other indicators are at odds with the national accounts 

data. In particular, the all-industry indicator, a 
commonly used and reliable output measure, suggests 
the opposite development. A
ccording to this indicator, 
growth was nearly flat in the first quarter and 
accelerated by 7.2% in the second quarter. Secondly, 
the Japanese authorities do 
not adjust the quarterly 
GDP data for the additional leap year day when 
producing the seasonally ad
justed data. Thirdly, the 
growthcomposition in the second quarter remained 

favourable, with private consumption and investment 
supporting growth whereas 
public investment and a 
reduction in inventories exerted a strong drag on 

growth. 
In the first half of 2004, output expansion continued 
to be driven mainly by private expenditure and net 
exports. Private consumption growth remained strong. 

Although real wages continued to decline, 
consumption was supported by a more favourable 
employment situation and a prolonged decline in the 
savings rate. Private invest
ment kept on expanding, in 
line with robust profit growth, albeit at a more 
moderate pace than in 2003. Exports continued to 

expand briskly, benefitin
g not only from strong 
demand in China, but also from accelerating demand 
in other Asian countries. 
Growth is expected to slow down somewhat in the 
forecast period
Looking ahead, the peak of the recovery seems to 
have been passed and growth 
is likely to continue at a 
somewhat more subdued pace. Available leading 
economic indicators suggest that the general picture 
remains positive, although more mixed than a year 

ago. Overall, both 
corporate and consumer confidence 
remain at high levels. Factors affecting private 
demand are moderately positiv
e and export growth is 
expected to decelerate, albeit from a high level, in line 
with the global economic slowdown. The economy is 
projected to reduce speed slightly, to a growth path 

between 2 and 2½% in annualised terms for the 
remainder of the forecast period, resulting in annual 
average growth rates of some 4.2% in 2004
1, 2.1% in 
2005 and 2.3% in 2006.  
Employment has risen but real wages continue to 
fall  Total employment has been rising, but whereas job 
creation has been strong in the services sector, the 

manufacturing sector has continued to reduce its 
workforce. Moreover, there is a general tendency to 
replace regular workers with workers on temporary 

contracts, resulting in an overall fall in real wages per 
person. Unemployment declined from the beginning 
of the year up to June. However, since then, due to an 
increase in labour force participation, the 
unemployment rate has edged up slightly, reaching 

4.8% of the labour force in August. 
1Data for real growth continue to be overestimated due to the 
statistical method used to calculate the national accounts data. 
The authorities are currently considering changing the method 
and they may do so in 2005. The figures forecast for 2005 and 
2006 show the expected underlying development in real 

growth, i.e. excluding the accelerating statistical bias.

Deflation might soon come to an end 
Deflation is currently ve
ry mild and, according to 
the CPI, was running at -0.2% year-on-year in 
August. Depending on th
eevolution of the oil price 
and the price of rice, which has an important impact 
on the Japanese CPI, the year-on-year change in the 
CPI could turn positive in the first half of 2005.
No major changes expected in monetary and 
fiscal policies No substantial monetary or fiscal policy measures 
have been announced. 
The Bank of Japan has 
committed itself to conti
nuing with the current 
quantitative easing framework (implying zero 

interest rates) until deflation has been brought to a 
definite end. The government aims at achieving 
primary balance in the first half of the 2010s, but 

there is no medium-ter
m consolidation programme 
which spells out more concrete measures. 
Risks to the forecast 
Protracted high oil prices constitute a downward 
risk to the forecast, although the direct impact on 
Japan should be fairly limited. First, Japan is one of 

the most energy-efficient countries in the world. 
Second, the pass-through fr
om high crude oil prices 
to consumer prices has been very limited, also 

mitigated by the appreciation of the yen. The risk 
for Japan is thus related more to a possible fall in 
external demand from other Asian countries, which 

have a much stronger oil-dependency. As the rest of 
Asia represents approximately half of Japanese 
exports, a marked slowdown in these countries 
would, of course, have a clear negative impact on 
Japanese growth.
