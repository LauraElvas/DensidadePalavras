xOverviewModerate recovery 
under way in Europe 
After bottoming out in the first half of 2003, the economies of the euro area 
and EU turned around in the second half of the year. The average growth rate 
for the year as a whole is estimated to have been 0.4% in the euro area and 
0.8% in the EU. In view of the buoyancyof global growth and trade, and the 

returning confidence of domestic producers and consumers, the recovery is 
set to gather momentum this year. A rebound to average growth rates of 
1.7% for the euro area and 2% for the EUis projected for 2004, levelling off 

at around 2.4% in 2005. 
Apart from the external stimulus from global demand, the main factors 
behind the outlook for the recovery include accommodative macroeconomic 
policy conditions, continued disinflation,supportive financial conditions, and 
progress in structural reforms.  
The recovery is underpinned by a risein investment expenditure, supported 
by a more gradual pick-up in private consumption. Despite this projected 

increase in the momentum of economic activity, the protracted downturn 
should continue to weigh on the performance of the labour market. 
Employment growth is expected to register 0.3% in 2004 and a somewhat 

better 0.9% in 2005.  
Buoyant world economy boosts global trade 
After the weak growth in world trade in 2002, a strong rebound of about 5% 
is estimated to have taken place in 2003. The near-term outlook is for a 
further acceleration to around 8% in 2004-2005. 
World GDP growth is estimated to have been stronger-than-expected at 3.7% 
in 2003. This year, world economic activity should expand at a robust 4.5%, 

before levelling off in 2005. This acceleration is supported by a number of 
factors, including accommodative macroeconomic policies, supportive
financialconditions and a return of confidence. 
The regional distribution of world growth widened in 2003, with stronger 
than expected contributions coming from the US, the CIS, OPEC, Asia 

(especially China) and the acceding countries. In the US, helped by monetary 
and fiscal policy stimulus and solid underlying productivity growth, the 
recovery is expected to continue withgrowth at 4.2% in 2004. Nonetheless, 

in view of the high general government and current account deficits, this 
pace of economic expansion is viewed as unsustainable, and the growth rate 
is expected to decline to 3.2% in 2005. 
Prospects for Japan have improved markedly with a sharp upward adjustment 
of growth from an estimated 2.7% in2003 to 3.4% this year. Deflation 
1Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 appears to be coming to an end, but the general government deficit is 
expected to remain above 7% of GDP in 2004 and 2005. The economic 
outlook for Asia (excluding Japan) rema
ins buoyant with growth in the 
vicinity of 7% in 2004-2005. During this period, Hong Kong and Korea are 
expected to take up the slack created by a slight attenuation of the striking 
growth rates of China and India. Among the other emerging regions, Latin 

America is expected to double its growth rate in 2004 after a lacklustre 
performance in 2003. Economicactivity is also expected to pick up speed in 
Africa. In the countries preparing for accession on 1 May 2004 and the other 

candidate countries, continued strong growth is expected throughout the 
forecast period, supported by domestic demand and structural change.   
Rising commodity prices and recovering 
stock markets 
The global recovery has put upward pressure on both fuel and non-fuel 
commodity prices. While the appreciation of the euro has shielded the euro 
area from many of the adverse effects of this trend, its implications for the 

world economy are less encouraging.  
The assumed profile for oil prices has been revised upwards compared to the 
Autumn forecasts. From an average of USD 28.5 per barrel (Brent crude) in 
2003, the price of oil is assumed to decline gradually from a high of USD 
31.5 per barrel in the first and second quarters of this year, yielding an 

average of USD 31.1 per barrel for the year as a whole. Some easing is 
foreseen during the course of 2005, 
producing an average of USD 28.9 per 
barrel.After stabilising in the middle of last year, equity prices continued their 
upward trend into the new year, before levelling off somewhat recently. 
Long-term government bond yields have remained low by historical 
standards, despite improving global growth prospects.Corporate bond 

spreads have also narrowed to historically low levels. Overall, these 
developments, which suggest that financing conditions in the global 
economy have improved compared to one year ago, should be supportive of 

the recovery.   
Growth re-emerged in 
the euro area and EU 
economies in the second 
half of 2003 – 
After stagnating during the first half of2003, the economies of both the euro 
area and the EU as a whole experienced a turnaround in the third quarter of 
the year.For the euro area, the rebound was driven by a surge in the growth of 
exports, while the growth-contribution of domestic demand was negative. 
The latter was due in particular to the negative performance of investment in 

the third quarter. Domestic demand took over from trade as the engine of 
growth in the last quarter of the year. Investment picked up considerably, 
breaking a prolonged downward tr
end. However, lacklustre private 
consumption provided no impulse to growth and the contribution of net 
exports turned negative due to a sharp rise in the growth of imports. 
The recovery, which took place in the second half of 2003, was broadly in 
line with predictions in the Autumn forecast.However, the source of the 

turnaround was somewhat surprising as the stronger-than-expected growth in 
the third quarter was driven by external rather than internal demand. The 
outcome for the last quarter was closerto expectations both in terms of the 

magnitude and the composition of growth. 
2Overview–and will gain 
momentum in 2004 
Survey indicators have been sending out encouraging signals for the 
prospects of a recovery since the middle of last year. While the euro-area 

economic sentiment indicator has improved since summer 2003, capacity 
utilisation in manufacturing is still below its long-term average. Business 
sentiment in the manufacturing sector has hesitated somewhat recently, but 

the improvement in production expectations has been maintained.  
In the services sector, confidence is still at a low ebb but demand 
expectations are advancing. The gradual rise in consumer confidence is based 
mainly on a better outlook for the economy and for the labour market. This 
should lead to greater optimism on the part of households regarding their 

own financial situation, which should in turn provide an impulse to consumer 
spending. 
The projected recovery in business and household spending in the coming 
months stems in part from the particularly low real interest rates, both short-
term and long-term. This has contributed to an easing of the balance-sheet 
constraints of households and businesses through a reduction in debt 
servicing costs. The rebound in stock markets since March of last year and 

the buoyant housing markets in some Member States have also helped to 
partially restore wealth lost following the bursting of the stock market 
bubble. Households™ real disposable income has been sustained by the 

resilience of employment and real wage growth. The projected decline in 
inflation should also provide a positive stimulus to consumption.  
The average growth rate in the euro area is projected to rise to 1.7% in 2004 
and 2.3% in 2005 (2.0% and 2.4% in the EU, respectively), barely unchanged 
from last autumn™s forecast. Growth is expected to be supported by domestic 
demand, which in turn will be sustained by an acceleration of capital 

formation during the course of 2004, followed by a more gradual recovery of 
private consumption expenditure.

3Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 Encouraging labour market performance 
and outlook 
Despite the prolonged downturn, the risein the unemployment rate has been 
quite moderate in comparison to previous cycles. The euro area 
unemployment rate stabilised at 8.8% in the second quarter of 2003, after 
increasing by 0.8 of a percentage point 
during the slowdown in the current 
cycle. This contrasts with a rise of over 2 percentage points to above 10% in 
the trough of the early nineties. On the employment side, the picture is also 

more encouraging insofar as job losses are concerned. No jobs were lost in 
net terms in the recent downturn, while more than 2.5 million jobs 
disappeared in the 1992-93 recession.
In line with the gradual nature of the recovery and the usual lagged response 
of the labour market, about half a million jobs are expected to be created this 

year. However, this figure should morethan double in 2005 as the recovery 
gathers pace. The euro area unemployment rate is expected to remain stable 
at 8.8% (8.1% in the EU) this year, before edging downwards in 2005.  
Headline inflation set to 
fall below 2% this year 
Notwithstanding the economic slowdown and the appreciation of the euro, 
headline inflation remained sluggish
 in 2003, buoyed up by such temporary 
factors as weather-induced food and energy price hikes and rises in indirect 
taxes. Compared to an estimated 2.1% in2003, headline inflation is expected 
to fall to 1.8% this year, as a result of the lagged effects of the euro 

appreciation and weak domestic price pressures. Inflation should fall further 
to 1.6% in 2005. Core inflation was also rather stickyduring 2003. Services sector inflation 
was particularly sluggish in view of the sector™s relatively low productivity 

and less exposure to competition than the manufacturing sector. However, a 
reduction in the pace of unit labour cost growth, as labour productivity picks 
up and wage moderation continues, should also lead to a fall in core inflation. 
Diverse fiscal developmentsFollowing the estimated deterioration in 2003, the general government deficit 
in the euro area is expected to remainstable at 2.7% of GDP in 2004 (2.6% 

in the EU), before declining marginally in 2005. With respect to 2003, the 
general government balance is expected to deteriorate this year in all EU 
countries, except Germany, Spain, France, Austria and the UK. It should be 

noted that in the case of Denmark, Sweden and Finland, this deterioration 
refers to a fall in the surplus.  
Among the six countries projected to exceed the 3% of GDP reference value 
in 2004, the deficit already exceeded 3% in Germany, France and the 
Netherlands in 2003. The figures for this year imply an improvement for 

Germany and France and a further slightdeterioration for the Netherlands. In 
Greece, Italy and Portugal, the trends in public finances are foreseen to push 
the deficit beyond 3% this year. The forecasts for Italy and Portugal reflect 
the expiration of one-off measures that were instrumental in keeping the 
deficit below 3% in 2003. The forecast for Greece is based on the sharp 

revision of the deficit to 3% of GDP in 2003, recently communicated by the 
government. This is currently being scrutinized by Eurostat and is subject to 
possible revision. Among the other countries, which have a projected deficit 
below the reference value in 2004, this reflects a deterioration in the case of 
Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg, no change in Austria, and an 
improvement from above 3% in the case of the UK. The remaining four 

countries, Denmark, Spain, Finland and Sweden, should continue to post a 
surplus. 
4OverviewIn 2005, a slight improvement is expected for the euro area, with the general 
government deficit declining to 2.6% of GDP (2.4% for the EU). The 

forecast for 2005 is carried out on the basis of a ﬁno policy changeﬂ 
assumption and, hence, does not include measures that may be adopted in the 
next budgets. Four countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal) 

are, under such an assumption, projected to exceed the reference value of 
3%.  
Upside and downside 
risks to the forecast 
Many regions of the world are sending out encouraging signals in support of 
a continuation of global growth. This reinforces the likelihood of a broad-
based simultaneous acceleration of growth across the world, which would 
generate a mutually reinforcing growthmomentum. However, long-standing 

macroeconomic imbalances may hold back growth in the US economy later 
in the forecast period. Rising oil and other commodity prices might also put a 
damper on global growth. On balance, however, the international 

environment implies an upside bias. 
A renewed sharp appreciation in the euro exchange rate could undermine 
activity mainly in the euro-area manufacturing sector, especially in those 
Member States that have recently depended on external demand to generate 

economic growth. On the other hand, any further appreciation would ease 
inflationary pressures further and, accordingly, raise real disposable income.  
The protracted nature of the downturn and uncertainties related to current and 
future income have undermined consumer confidence, leading to the 
postponement of consumption plans and sluggish private consumption. 

Survey indicators suggest that consumers are still wary about committing 
themselves to purchases of larger consumer durable goods. Furthermore, 
although geopolitical tensions diminished inthe second half of 2003, the 

threat of terrorist attacks continues to weigh on consumer confidence, 
particularly in view of the events in Madrid in early March. With the 
resumption of confidence, the release of pent-up demand would accelerate 

the return to potential growth. The rise in house prices in a number of EU 
countries and the contribution of the risein stock markets to restoration of 
household wealth should also support spending.  
Although investment is being supportedby favourable financing conditions 
and positive developments in earnings and profitability, possible constraints 
posed by the incomplete adjustment of balance sheets cannot be ruled out. It 
should also be recalled that confidence canbe positively affected by visible 

progress on structural reforms.  
Overall, the balance of risks appears to have shifted towards the downside in 
recent months. 
Acceding countries 
A positive stimulus from EU integration
Despite weak growth in the EU, the economies of the new Member States are 
estimated to have expanded on av
erage at a robust 3.6% in 2003, as 
accession unleashes favourable growth dynamics.  In particular, private 

consumption supported growth, notably in the Baltic States, Hungary and the 
Czech Republic. Three factors underpinned household spending: (i) 
increased real disposable income, partly thanks to relatively low inflation 

close to the euro-area level in many countries; (ii) greater access to credit as 
a result of the development of the banking system; (iii) anticipated spending 
5Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 ahead of expected price rises in 2004, linked to indirect tax hikes.   
Investment activity was weak in 2003 (except in the Baltic States), reflecting 
the global situation, but also as a consequence of the stalling reform process 
in the acceding countries. Exports did very well, notably in Slovakia, which, 
given weak EU demand, is mostly explained by an export basket with a 

higher value-added content. In Poland, the depreciation of the zloty 
contributed significantly to the good export performance. 
More investment, but the unemployment rate is slow to decrease 
Interest rate convergence towards EUlevels, the need to improve 
infrastructure and the recovery in the EU are the factors which should lift 
investment growth from a meagre 1.9% in the acceding countries last year to 

7.3% in 2005. In general, economic activity will also be supported by the 
availability of EU funds (estimated at 3% of GDP in the acceding countries 
over the period 2004-2006, including pre-accession aid, and after the 

contribution to the EU budget). Average growth in the acceding countries 
should be around 4% in 2004 and 2005. 
Catching-up should continue vigorouslyas the new Member States with the 
lowest per capita GDP are expected to grow the fastest. Benefiting from 
macroeconomic stability, the Baltic Statesare expected to post growth rates 

above 5% in 2004-2005. The strongest acceleration of growth is forecast in 
Poland (from 1.4% in 2002 to almost 5% in 2005) on the back of an 
expansionary fiscal policy. Among the high-income acceding countries, 
Cyprus is also expected to grow relatively strongly, but the prospects for re-
unification entail both upside and downside risks. 
In 2004-2005, employment is expected to increase moderately in the 
acceding countries as the economy picks up and new activities develop, 

compensating for jobs lost in the restructuring process. However, the 
unemployment rate is set to decline only slowly to 13.8% in 2005 in the 
acceding countries as a whole, compared to 14.3% in 2003. 
Inflation set to increase 
Except in Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia, inflation was particularly low in 
2003 in the new Member States at aboutthe same level as in the euro area, 

thanks to increased competition and low import prices. An acceleration is, 
however, expected in 2004 to 3.8% onaverage, linked to an increase in 
indirect taxes as tax rates are adjusted to the EU levels. A subsequent easing 

of inflation to 3.3% is projected for 2005. 
High government deficits, but generally 
expected to decline 
On average, the general government deficit in the acceding countries is 
estimated to be about 5.7% of GDP in2003, worse than in 2002. In the 
Czech Republic, the deficit increased considerably because of the inclusion 
of some state guarantees. The deficit ranges from a surplus in Estonia to a 
deficit of 12.9% of GDP in the Czech Republic. Five other countries had 
deficits in excess of 3% of GDP in2003: Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Poland 

and Slovakia. As fiscal consolidation resumes, government balances are expected to 
improve in most new Member States in2004, with the notable exception of 
Poland. Despite strong growth, budgetary balances are also worsening in the 
Baltic States, because of accession-related expenditures. In Lithuania, the 

deficit is approaching the 3% of GDP threshold, while in Estonia the large 
surplus of 2.6% of GDP in 2003 should completely disappear in 2005.

Other candidate 
countriesThe other candidate countries will see acontinued improvement in their 
macroeconomic performance. Growth is expected to amount to around 5% 
per year over the forecast period. Private domestic demand remains the 
driving force behind grow
th in each country. In Turkey and Romania, disinflation should continue, driven by the trend real 
appreciation of the exchange rate of these countries, a strengthening of the 

supply side of their economies, driven by stronginvestment, and overall 
prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Towards the end of the forecasting 
horizon, inflation is foreseen to be in single digits in both countries, as is 

already the case in Bulgaria with quite low, but slightly accelerating, 
inflation.Despite sustained gains inlabour productivity, strongeconomic growth will 
lead to a rise in employment in all countries and falling unemployment, 
although the improvement will be very small in Turkey due tothe strong rise 

in labour supply. 
The general government deficit will see a moderate widening in Bulgaria and 
Romania, whereas Turkey will continue to experience a significant reduction 
of its deficit.  
In all three countries, current account balances are set to widen further, 
driven by strong domestic demand and a slight deterioration in the price 

competitiveness of exports, which leads to rising deficits in their respective 
merchandise trade balances.  
7Chapter 1 The world economy1. Global growth strengthens
The global economic recovery continues to gain 
momentum. Growth has surged, in particular, in the US 
and Japan and has remained strong in other Asian 

countries, especially in China and India. Building on 

the strong performance in the second half of 2003, 

world growth should increase significantly to rates of 

4.5%in2004 and 4.3% in 2005. Global growth is likely 
to be more broadly based, as activity in the 

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and OPEC 

countries is also expected to be robust.  
Strong world trade growth 
The upturn in the global economy is evident in the 
growth of world trade, which increased substantially 

towards the end of 2003 (see graph 1.1).

The robust trade performance was no doubt due to the 
stronger-than-expected growth in world demand, 
especially in China, which is estimated to have 

accounted for close to 30% of growth in world imports 

in 2003. In addition, a number of temporary factors 

contributed to the pick-up in growth in trade at the end 

of 2003, in particular an anticipation of tax changes in 

China in 2004, which meant that Chinese exports were 

front-loaded to the fourth quarter of 2003. World trade 
is predicted to be strong in 2004 and 2005, growing by 
around 8% in both years.  
Graph 1.2 highlights the contribution of China to trade 
growth in 2003. Although remaining strong, China™s 

relative contribution to world trade growth will 

probably decline over the forecast period, in view of the 

rising contribution of the EU and the US.

%Upward pressure on commodity prices  
The global recovery has put pressure on commodity 
prices: both fuel and non-fuel commodities prices have 
risen strongly. China and India have become significant 

net importers of energy commodities. 
Strong growth in non-Japan Asia, in particular China, 
has been driving global de
mand growth for non-fuel 
commodities in recent years, boosted by investment 

growth and the strong expansion of the manufacturing 

sector in particular. The upturns in the US and Japanese 

economies have added to this demand growth. 
The price of oil in USD has been higher than expected 
in the Autumn forecast. This is a result of both supply 
and demand impulses. The decision by OPEC to reduce 

production quotas and concerns about the level of 
11Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 private reserves produced negative supply effects. On 
the other hand, demand has been supported by the cold 

winter in the US and rising demand for fuel from 

emerging Asia, especially China. The increase in oil 
prices is also putting upward pressure on other energy 

prices.100110120130140150160170200220032004

Monetary and financial conditions have been supportive 
of global growth as monetary policy has remained 
accommodative in US, Japan and the euro area. 

However, exchange rate movements have led to more 
expansionary monetary conditions in the US, while the 
opposite is true for the euro area.

With th
e exception of the UK, where the Bank of 
England has raised rates, short-term interest rates have 
remained low, leading to low short-term real interest 

rates, while inflation has remained subdued since 2002. 
Long-term bond yields remain low despite improving 
growth prospects. Sluggish employment growth in the 
US and the gradual decline in inflation in the euro area 
suggest that monetary policy will remain 
accommodative in both areas for the near future. The 
expected improvement in the labour market and the 
increase in commodity prices might, however, lead to a 

tightening of monetary policy in the US. 
Stock markets rose in 2003, with most major stock 
market indices trading around 30-35% higher, 
compared to February 2003. This is also indicative of 
improved financing conditionsfor firms, since higher 
stock prices have led to an increase in equity issuance 

and mergers and acquisitions. Although corporate 
earnings have grown, and stock prices remain below the 
previous historical highs reached in 2000, price levels 

appear high based on traditional indicators.

Global imbalances persist
The US current account deficit is projected to increase 
to 5.2% of GDP this year and to fall slightly to 5% of 
GDP in 2005, as imports growthis expected to remain 

robust. In Japan, despite the expected stronger growth 
in imports, the current account surplus is set to widen. 
Exports, in particular to other Asian countries, are 

likely to be buoyant. In the longer-term, the imbalances 
remain a source of risk for the world economy, since an 
adjustment of the US current account deficit has 
historically been accompanied by an adjustmentof US 
domestic demand.

132. The outlook outside the EU
USA  
The upturn in the US economy gained further 
momentum in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, 
with annualised growth rates of 8.2% and 4.1% 
respectively, leading to 3.1% growth in 2003. The 
stronger growth performance also reflects a better 

balance across GDP components. Although consumer 
spending and government consumption have 
remained strong, private investment growth picked up 
markedly on the back of high productivity growth and 
increasing corporate earnings. Positive effects on 

exports from the depreciation of the dollar have also 
been emerging, although robust growth in imports is 
expected to offset this in the current year. 
For 2004, a growth rate of 4.2% is projected, before 
declining to 3.2% in 2005, due in part to expected 
slower growth in consumer spending. Employment is 
projected to grow by 0.9% in 2004 and by 0.6% in 2005, 
without any change in the unemployment rate. 
JapanIn Japan, a sustained recovery has taken hold. Growth 
came out stronger than expected in 2003 at 2.7%, driven 

by the very robust annualised growth rate of 6.4% in the 

fourth quarter. Growth in main export markets, such as 
the US and China, is expected to remain firm. Profits 
growth should boost investment, while an improved wage 
and employment situation should lead to stronger private 
consumption. Overall, quarterly growth rates are 

projected to remain relatively firm at around 2.4% in 
annualised terms over the forecast horizon. The quarterly 
profile should result in annual average growth rates of 

3.4% in 2004 (helped by a large overhang) and 2.3% in 
2005.  Table 1.1

14Chapter 1 The world economy
CanadaFinal domestic demand is expected to remain relatively 
robust in 2004 and 2005, but growth will be held back 
by a negative contribution from net exports in the wake 
of the Canadian dollar™s recent appreciation. GDP 
growth is projected at 2.2% in 2004 and 3.0% in 2005. 
Domestic demand is being supported by monetary 
easing. Business investment is expected to strengthen in 
the period ahead, but private consumption should also 

pick up again after stagnating in the final quarter of 
2003. Household spending should be underpinned by 
rising employment and disposable income. 
Norway and Switzerland 
After experiencing a contraction in 2003, the 
Swisseconomy is set to recover by growing at 2.4% in 2004 
and 1.8% in 2005. The contraction in 2003 was due to 
the lagged effects of the global downturn, the strong 
Swiss franc and weakness in the tourism and financial 
services sectors. The healthy global outlook is expected 

to drive the recovery. In 
Norway, the combination of 
expansionary monetary and fiscal policy and more 
moderate wage settlements is contributing to the first 
signs of a resumption in growth. Fixed investment is 
expected to recover in 2004, after five successive years 
of contraction. Export demand is gradually picking up 

again, on the back of the global recovery and a weaker 
currency. Higher oil prices will also benefit the 
Norwegian economy. Real GDP growth is expected to 

pick up markedly, to 3% in 2004 and 2.7% in 2005. 
Asia (excl. Japan) Growth in the Asian countries should remain buoyant. 
InChina
, the SARS episode barely dented growth in 
2003, which registered a strong 9.1%. Growth is 
expected to slow marginally to 8.7 % in 2004 and 8.1% 
in 2005. China™s exports and imports should grow 

strongly, whereas a modest decline in foreign 
investment is expected. Domestic demand is set to 
support growth over the forecast period. Besides 

continued government spending, there are signs of 
strong private investment and consumption expenditure. 
The investment-to-GDP ratio, already at 45% of GDP, 
is also one of the signs of overheating that are 
appearing in the Chinese economy.  
InIndia
, GDP growth is expected to remain close to 
7%, after nearing 8% last year. In addition, growth rates 
are set to reach 5-6% in 
Korea
 and most other dynamic 
Asian economies. These favourable results are fuelled 
by both exports and, increasingly, by domestic demand. 
Russia, Ukraine and the other CIS  
Hydrocarbon price levels havea significant impact on 
the economy of 
Russia
, the world™s second largest oil 
exporter. In 2003, high world oil prices boosted GDP 
growth, which registered 7.3%. The high current 

account surplus and a decline in capital outflows have 
boosted liquidity and fuelled a boom in domestic 
demand and an appreciation of the rouble. Given the 

projected gradual decline in oil prices, growth is 
expected to slow down somewhat, but it should 
nevertheless remain robust at 6.5% in 2004 and 5.4% in 

2005.Ukraine
continues to be characterised by a healthy 
macroeconomic performance: GDP growth accelerated 
from 4.1% in 2002 to an estimated 8.5% in 2003. While 
remaining strong, it is projected to slow down 

somewhat in 2004-5. The current account surplus is 
expected to narrow as the impact of domestic demand 
on imports should more thanoffset exports growth. 
Most other 
CISare continuing to benefit from a 
favourable external environment (sustained imports 
demand in Russia and high commodity prices). These 

countries are, accordingly, expected to experience 
growth in a range of 5-7% in 2004. 
Latin America 
Following a weak economic performance in 2002, GDP 
growth in Latin America is estimated to have recovered 
in 2003 to 1.7%. Weak domestic demand in Brazil and 
Argentina and the recessions in Venezuela and Uruguay 
prevented a faster acceleration of regional growth, 
despite a marked reboundin economic activity in 
Argentina and economic expansion in the 3-4% range 
in Chile, Colombia and Peru. The region™s overall rate 
of growth is projected to accelerate significantly in 
2004 and 2005 (to 3.5% and 4.3%, respectively). This 
acceleration is supported by the recovery in the 
industrialised economies, improved investor sentiment 
towards emerging markets, and the effect on exports of 

the ongoing economic recovery in Argentina and 
Brazil.Africa  
Excluding the OPEC countries, growth in Africa is 
expected to have been just below 3% in 2003, 
supported mainly by domestic demand and some 
rebound in non-oil commodity prices. In general, 
improved political stability and the global economic 

upturn should improve prospects for 2004 and 2005, 
with GDP growth projected in the range of 3.6%-4.1%. 
15Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 1. Global growth has supported economic 
activityTurnaround in the second half of 2003 
Economic growth in the euro area rose by 0.4% in the 
third quarter of 2003 (q-o-q) and by 0.3% in the fourth 
quarter. After three successive quarters of stagnation, 
the turnaround was driven by a moderate rise in 
domestic demand and a surge in exports. The strong 
increase in world demand outweighed the dampening 
effect of the euro appreciation.  
Private consumption remained relatively subdued. 
Confidence has, nevertheless, recovered from the lows 
of the first half of 2003.

Exports lead the upturn 
After a striking increase of2.3% (q-o-q) in the third 
quarter, exports grew by only 0.2% in the last quarter of 
2003. The momentum of world trade seems to have 
offset the dampening impact of an appreciating 

currency. World imports of goods are estimated to have 
increased by 6.5% inthe last quarter of 2003, vis-à-vis 
the same quarter of the previous year. Compared to 
2002, euro area exports (intra and extra) of goods and 
services did not grow at all in 2003, but the carryover 

for 2004 is 1.1 pp. In real effective terms (using the CPI 
deflator), the euro appreciated by 10% over the past 
year (and by 18% over 2 years).

In view of the import content of exports, a delayed 
upturn in imports (2.1%) resulted in a negative 
contribution of net exports togrowth of 0.7 pp in the 
fourth quarter of 2003. Overthe year, the contribution 
of net exports to growthwas strongly negative 

at minus 0.6 pp in spite of sluggish domestic demand; 
this implies a carryover for 2004 of -0.2 pp. 
Revival in investment 
After three consecutive quarters of significant 
contraction in 2003, investment recorded a sharp upturn 
in the fourth quarter of 2003 at +0.6% q-o-q. In 2003,

This break in the three-year long decline appears to 
stem from the accelerator effect of strong foreign 
demand on domestic industrial production. However, 

despite the increase in new orders of capital goods since 
the end of 2003, it is too soon to conclude that a firm 
upward trend has been established. Capacity utilisation 

has remained below average, which is unusual at this 
stage of the recovery, i.e. almost two years after the 
trough.

Favourable financing conditions helped the recovery in 
investment: real (retail) interest rates and corporate 
bond yields bottomed out at low levels at the end of 
2003. Bank loan growth has accelerated since last 
summer and profitability has been improving since the 

second half of 2003. The rally in stock markets, which 
began last spring, has reduced debt-to-equity ratios and 
the relative cost of equity financing. Corporate earnings 

have improved, leading to balance-sheet restructuring, 
not least due to cost cutting measures. 
Adverse shocks and a possible structural break in 
household consumption 
The contribution provided by household spending to 
GDP growth has stalled since the second quarter of 
2003. The latest figures available (0.1% growth in the 
fourth quarter of 2003) suggest that private 

consumption has only tentatively recovered so far. 
Recent developments do not deviate from the sluggish 
pattern of consumption over the past three years. 
However, consumption growth (at +1%) is most likely 
to have outpaced real disposable income in 2003 as a 

whole, while the former grew at a slower pace than the 
latter in 2001 and 2002. But this does not provide 
conclusive evidence of a rebound, given that 

consumption can be more resilient than income during a 
recession. Moreover, substantial tax cuts were enacted 
which supported household spending in some large 

euro-area countries such as Germany and France. 
Inflation proved more stubborn than expected last year 
due to rises in oil, energy and administered prices. 
Perceptions of an increase in prices following the 
introduction of the euro may also have influenced 
savings behaviour. Employment declined over the past 

year in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, 
Denmark and the UK; in France, it did not increase 
sufficiently to curb unemployment. Prospects for a 

decline in unemployment have not brightened in the 
early part of 2004. The recent backtracking on the EU™s 
fiscal framework possibly weighed on confidence. The 
EC Business and Consumer Surveys pointed to a 
deterioration in consumer confidence coinciding with 

heightened geopolitical uncertainty early in 2003. 
Limited improvements in consumer confidence have 
been recorded since the second half of last year. The 

tentative improvement in retail trade confidence was 
not confirmed at the end of the year.  
Structural factors such as the non-sustainability of pay-
as-you-go pension systems, and increased risk 
associated with some funded pension schemes might 
also have prompted households to increase their savings 

in the recent years. Major reforms to public pension 
systems (recently undertaken in France and Italy), 
resulting in a reduction of future pensions, may have 

heightened future pensioners' awareness of risks to the 
public pension system. In addition, the bursting of the 
equity market bubble may have triggered a need to 
20Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU rebuild savings under other classes of assets such as 
housing, fixed income or cash in order to diversify 

risks. Increased savings were required in order to 
compensate for negative wealth effects from equities 
and also in order to reallocate savings to housing, since 

investments in stocks or mutual funds shares could not 
be liquidated without incurring large capital losses.

The strong increase in household mortgage borrowing, 
linked to house price increases, does not as such raise 
the issue of its sustainability, as the cost of servicing 
debt has not increased and the absolute level of 
indebtedness remains moderate according to 

international comparisons. However, it could have 
long-lasting effects. In an environment of low inflation 
and low interest rates, a higher level of indebtedness 
can be carried by the same level of debt servicing in the 
short run. Nevertheless, households are more vulnerable 

to declining real income, falling house prices and rising 
unemployment. Households that have variable interest 
rate mortgages (e.g. in Spain, Portugal, Greece or, to a 

lesser extent, Italy) are also more vulnerable to rising 
interest rates. 4546474849505152535455990001020304

Mixed signals from inventories 
The recent pattern of inventories is difficult to interpret. 
A slight depletion in the third quarter of 2003 (-0.2% of 
GDP) was followed by a surge in stock-building in the 

fourth quarter (0.5% of GDP). The latter may be 
different in nature than the technical corrections 
observed in the first half of 2003. Some special factors, 

such as increasing stocks of oil reserves prior to the war 
in Iraq, may also have played a role then. The latest 
increase might be a reflection of the upturn in industrial 

output against a background of not-so-strong demand. 
Past developments also show that higher expected 
production can trigger a rise in stocks through imports 

(e.g. commodities). The contribution of stock-building 
to growth in 2003 was 
0.3 pp and the carryover for 
2004 is already 0.3 pp. The results of the last four 

quarters should nevertheless be treated with the usual 
caution, as the change in inventories is a ﬁresidualﬂ item 
in the quarterly national accounts.

21Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 Strong government consumption  
In contrast to private consumption, government 
spending continued to increase at an annualised rate of 
2.4% in the second half of 2003. The financing of the 
social security deficit, the rescuing of highly indebted 

public or private companies (in particular in France or 
Italy), and the pick-up in public goods orders for 
infrastructure (especially in Greece for the forthcoming 

Olympic games) or defence are among the factors that 
contributed to growth in public spending. 
Industrial sector back on track 
The sector breakdown of GDP growth confirms that 
industrial production accounts for the bulk of the 
recovery. In the last quarter of 2003, industrial 
production increased by 0.5% compared to one year ago 
in the euro area and by 0.1% in the EU. The retail 
sector is still suffering from the sluggishness of 
consumption. After three consecutive quarters of sharp 

contraction, output in the agricultural sector expanded 
once again in the fourth quarter.

Similar profile in the European Union 
Demand components displayed a similar profile in the 
EU for 2003, with the notable exception of household 
consumption. The yearlygrowth rate for 2003 was 

0.8% compared to 0.4% for the euro area. The 
difference is basically accounted for by consumption, 
which grew at a strong pace of 3% in the UK and was 

more resilient in Sweden than in the euro area. The 
carryover of private consum
ption growth for 2004 is 
0.5%. The contribution of net exports to growth in 2003 
was -0.5%. The growth contribution of investment, at 
-0.2%, is equal to that observed for the euro area. 

Government consumption increased at an annual rate of 
1.9%. 
22Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU Box 2.1:Some specificities behind the forecasts
Exchange rates 
A constant nominal exchange rate in the ERMII (DKK/EUR 
rates) and constant real rates (nominal rates adjusted for 
changes in GDP deflators) for Sweden, the UK and non-EU 
currencies are assumed.  
The reference period used for the exchange rate constancy 
assumption is the average exchange rate of 23 February to 5 
March 2004, which is attributed to the first quarter of 2004. 
The average USD/EUR rate for that period was 1.25 and the 
JPY/EUR rate 134.9.  This leads to implied average 
USD/EUR rates of 1.25 in 2004 and 1.24 in 2005, and 
average JPY/EUR rates of 133.4 and 130.3 in 2004 and 2005 
respectively.  
For the acceding countries, currencies are treated according 
to their policy regimes. Hence for the CYP (Cyprus pound), 
EEK (Estonian kroon), HUF (Hungarian forint) and the LTL 
(Lithuanian litas), constant nominal exchange rates vis-à-vis 
the euro are assumed. For the PLN (Polish zloty), CZK 
(Czech koruna), SIT (Slovenian tolar) and SKK (Slovakian 
koruna), constant real rates against the euro are assumed. For 
currencies pegged to a basket (Latvian lat and Maltese lira), 
the future rate is deduced from the evolution of the currencies 
constituting the basket. 
Interest rates
Short-term interest rates are set in order to reflect the 
objective of monetary policy with respect to price stability.  
Long-term interest rate assumptions are based on 
developments in short-term rates and an assessment of 
economic conditions.  Attention is paid to international 
financial linkages, market expectations and budgetary 
developments.Commodity prices
Commodity prices are forecast taking into account market 
conditions. In the case of oil prices special attention is paid to 
futures prices. Prices for Brent oil are, accordingly, projected 
to be 31.1 USD/bl in 2004 and 28.9 USD/bl in 2005.   
Prices of primary commodities, excluding fuels, are assumed 
to increase by 15.6% in 2004 and to decline by 2.6% in 2005.  
The strongest price increases in 2004 apply to the group of 
metals, with a 25% annual rise. In 2005, the prices of all 
groups of non-fuel products are expected to decline compared 
to 2004. Budgetary dataEstimates for 2003 are based on the Excessive Deficit 
Procedure notification, submitted by the Member States in 
March 2004. This information is found in a Eurostat Report 
of 16 March (press release 38/2004). It should be noted that 
Eurostat™s recent decision (2 March 2004) on the sectoral 
classification of funded pension schemes was not taken into 
account in this notification. The consequences of this 
decision, which could lead to a revision of the deficit and 
debt data in some countries, will be assessed on a case-by-
case basis in time for the second 2004 notification next 
September. For 2004, budgets adopted or presented to 
parliaments and all other measures known in sufficient detail 
are taken into consideration. For 2005, the "no-policy 
change" assumption used in the forecasts implies the 
extrapolation of measures and trends that are known at the 
time of completion of the forecasts. 
The government balances reported in the notification may be 
different from those published in the national accounts 
because of an amendment to ESA95. According to 
Regulation (EC) N° 2558/2001 on the reclassification of 
settlements under swaps agreements and forward rate 
agreements, interest flows under swaps have been reclassified 
from ﬁincome propertyﬂ to ﬁfinancial accountﬂ. However, the 
Regulation states the need for specific treatment of these 
flows for data transmitted under the Excessive Deficit 
Procedure, allowing for interest expenditure to include 
swaps, contrary to the ESA95 new rules. In the forecasts, it is 
the EDP definition of general government balances that is 
presented. Therefore, the calculation of general government 
expenditure does include swap-related settlements. 
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output gaps
Year 2004 is a leap year. The addition of one extra working 
day implies that EU annual output increases, other things 
being equal, by about 0.3 of a percentage point.  Annual GDP 
figures are not adjusted for the number of working days, 
while quarterly national accounts figures of most countries 
are. This means that the simple addition of the four quarters 
of a single year may not add up exactly to the annual figure. 
Moreover, the calculation of potential GDP, from which the 
output gap is derived, does not involve any adjustment for the 
number of working days in the leap year, because this is 
considered to be a temporary phenomenon, which should not 
affect the cyclically adjusted balances that are calculated 
using these output gaps. Hence, for 2004, the increase in the 
negative output gap would be larger if it were not a leap year. 
232. Capital formation should lead growth 
activityWhile government consumption will continue to make a 
modest contribution to growth in 2004 and 2005, private 
consumption and investmentin equipment will raise 
euro area GDP growth from 1.7% in 2004 to above 2% 
in 2005. The strength of the exchange rate is increasing the 
competitive pressure on European producers. Imports of 
goods and services will advance firmly, while exports 
will be sustained by stronger world trade. The external 
contribution to growth will bealmost zero in 2004 and 

2005. Stock-building is not foreseen to add to growth 
over the forecast horizon. 
2.1. Households: income developments 
come to the rescueHouseholds have continued to borrow at a brisk 
pace, mainly to finance house purchases  
Household debt expanded rapidly throughout 2003, and 
even accelerated at the end of the year. In January 2004, 
bank loans to euro area households grew at an annual 
rate of 6.5%. Loans for house purchases remained the 
most dynamic component, accelerating to an annual rate 
of 8.3% in January 2004. For the euro area as a whole, 
household debt exceeds 50% of GDP and is likely to 

have surpassed 80% of disposable income Œ although 
this is still well below the corresponding ratios (above 
100%) in the United States and the United Kingdom. In 

general, those Member States, in which household debt 
has grown fastest, have experienced rapid rises in house 
prices (Portugal being an exception).

24Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU The sustained accumulation of household debt may be a 
factor contributing to the weakness in consumer demand 
in the euro area, outweighing any positive wealth effect 

from higher asset prices. While debt-servicing costs have 
benefited from low interest rates, total repayments, i.e. 
amortisation and interest, have probably increased. In 
such circumstances, it cannot be excluded that the 
income and liquidity effects of heavy indebtedness 
would outweigh any positive wealth effects from higher 

house prices Œ particularly in continental Europe, where 
house equity withdrawal is unusual. The recovery in 
equity prices would also be expected to have positive 

wealth effects in the household sector. However, as 
equity prices remain below the peaks of 1999-2000 and, 
given the low propensity to consume out of wealth 

(compared to the UK and the US), positive effects on 
consumption will remain limited.

Housing valuations appear high in several euro area 
Member States (e.g., the Netherlands, Ireland, and 
Spain) and there is evidence that lending conditions are 
tightening. The annual rate of increase in house prices in 
the euro area has averaged about 7% in 2000-2003. The 
ECB January 2004 Bank Lending Survey reports some 
tightening of (current and future) lending standards for 
loans to households for house purchase, partly due to 
worsening prospects in the housing market. Indeed, 

since last summer mortgage interest rates have risen 
somewhat.  
The macroeconomic risk stemming from a reversal in 
house prices appears limited at the level of the euro area. 
House price inflation has been relatively moderate in the 
larger euro-area Member States and the structure of 

household liabilities Œ mainly long-term and fixed-rate Œ  
would lessen the impact of a rise in interest rates. 
However, there might be strains in some of the smaller 

euro-area Member States where prices have risen fast 
and the size and maturity structure of household debt 
means that variations in interest rates would have a 
greater impact on household disposable income (such as 
Ireland, Greece, and Spain).

25Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 Income gains will support private consumption 
growth 
The euro-area labour market has shown greater 
resilience to the slowdown than in past economic cycles. 
Employment is expected to grow in 2004. Increasing 

employment, tax cuts in some Member States and 
growth in compensation per head exceeding the inflation 
rate bode well for the development of disposable income 

growth. The expected evolution of households™ wealth 
should also be supportive of private consumption 
expenditure.  
Information on the consumption of durable goods in 
France and Italy supports the hypothesis of the existence 
of pent-up demand. During 2002 and the first half of 

2003, consumption of durable goods in Franceand Italy, 
taken together, shrank on average by 0.3% in each 
quarter, while total consumption increased by the same 

average rate. Assuming such a trend can be generalised 
to the whole euro area, thiswould suggest the existence 
of considerable pent-up demand.  
An analysis of recent survey evidence supports the view 
that more households intend to undertake major 
purchases. Up to now, the improvement in consumer 
confidence was mainly based on a better outlook for the 
economy and for the labour market. This is expected to 

lead to greater optimism on the part of households 
regarding their own financial situation.

2.2. Firms: positive investment outlook 
Low interest rates and a recovering investor appetite 
for risk have brought down the cost of finance for 

companiesFinancing costs in the euro-area corporate sector have 
declined further since autumn 2003. Equity prices have 
moved higher and corporate bond spreads have 
narrowed to historically low levels. Moreover, interest 
rates on bank loans, which are the largest source of 
corporate financing in the euro area, have fallen in the 

course of 2003, even though comparable risk-free 
interest rates have edged up since the mid-year. With the 
euro-area inflation rate expected to remain close to 2%, 

the real cost of corporate financing is now very low by 
historical standards.

corporations
Source: ECB, Eurostat, and own calculations. Data for 2003-Q3 are estimates.
By exploiting the favourable financing conditions to re-
finance existing debt and by reducing capital 
expenditure, companies have been able to improve their 
balance sheets. Corporate debtlevels have stabilised 
(relative to GDP) and the aver
age maturity of corporate 
liabilities has been lengthened. A retrenchment in capital 

expenditure and a recovery in profits have allowed 
companies to reduce the financing gap. In consequence, 
the downgrade/upgrade ratio in the credit rating of 

companies fell in 2003 relative to 2002 and there has 
also been a decline in credit-risk premia. The ECB Bank 
Lending Survey for January 2004 points to a continued 

fall in the percentage of banks reporting a tightening of 
corporate credit standards, although the balance remains 
positive.Evidence of a modest acceleration in net corporate 
borrowing has been accompanied, more recently, by 
indications of increased investment activity. While MFI 

loans to the non-financial corporate sector slowed down 
to an annual rate of 3.1% in January 2004 (from a steady 
rate around 3.6% in the course of 2003), issuance of 
26Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU corporate securities was considerably more buoyant, 
growing at annual rates close to 10% in the last three 
quarters of 2003. Moreover, there was a strong 
acceleration in securities issuance by non-monetary 

financial institutions (up by23.3% on the previous year 
in December 2003). This largely reflects issuance by 
dedicated financial subsidiaries of non-financial 

corporations. Even lower-rated companies appear to 
have regained access to the bond market in the latter part 
of 2003. In contrast, however, issuance of quoted shares 

remained subdued. Recent data suggest that part of the 
increased financing is being used to expand capital 
investment. In addition to the pick-up in capital spending 

in the fourth quarter of 2003, the ECB bank lending 
survey provides evidence of increased financing needs 
for fixed investment, inventories and working capital. It 

is notable that the increase in lending demand was 
particularly pronounced among SMEs, which have 
limited access to direct financing channels and so far 

have not benefited from the lower cost of bond and 
equity financing.

AAAAOverall, financing constraints on capital expenditure 
appear much looser than one year ago, but the prospects 
for the corporate sector are still uncertain. In spite of the 
progress made, it is unclear whether the excess leverage 
accumulated during the 1990s has been completely 
worked out. Absolute levels of corporate debt and 

gearing ratios remain high, and the overall rating 
position of non-financial corporations is still 
considerably worse now than in 2000 (especially in 
sectors such as telecoms and automobiles). In addition, 
there are concerns that bothequities and corporate bonds 

could be overpriced, suggesting the risk of a sharp 
reversal in prices. Recentfinancial reports have 
indicated that the acceleration in output growth in the 
second half of 2003 has boosted earnings but, in a 
context of falling export profit margins and reduced 
scope for cost-efficiency improvements, sustained 

profitability will hinge on a pick-up in domestic demand. 
Investment: healthy growth foreseen 
The 0.6% q-o-q surge in gross fixed capital formation in 
the last quarter of 2003 was the fastest quarterly increase 
in three years. A further recovery in investment is 

expected, underpinned by the lower cost of financing 
and the increased availability of bank loans. Moreover, 
confidence has increased, as witnessed by business 

survey results, and technological progress will also 
support investment. 
Perceptions of current business conditions and business 
expectations in industry both rose in the second half of 
2003. However, in the capital goods sector, the evolution 
of the two indicators is more synchronised compared to 

the industry aggregate, where a dichotomy between the 
assessment of current production trends and production 
expectations still persists.  
Investment in equipment is likely to benefit from the 
increased use of information and communication 
technology (ICT) in firms™ operations. The productivity-
enhancing role and the continuous developments in ICT 
are shortening the average life-cycle of productive 

equipment.

Domestic demand will gradually take the place of 
external demand to bring capacity utilisation rates to a 
higher level. At 80.7% in 2004Q1, capacity utilisation in 
manufacturing is still below its long-term average. 

However, for the capital goods sector, the rate exceeds 
27Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 already the long-term average, mainly as a result of 
strong foreign demand for European capital goods 
(mostly from East Asia and oil-producing countries). 
Although demand for capital goods is expected to 
improve, the growth pattern is unlikely to be sustained. 

Two factors may weigh on investment growth. First, 

despite the recent improvement in financial conditions, it 
appears that the level of debt in the corporate sector is 
rather high. Second, as a result of the resilience of the 

labour market during the downturn, labour productivity 
growth in the euro area has been below 0.5% per year 
during three consecutive years (it was somewhat higher 

in the EU, between 0.4% and 0.6%). Stronger demand 
will bring labour productivity growth in the euro area to 
about 1½% in 2004 and 2005. This is just above the 

average for 1996-2000, but still below the average of 
1991-1995. 
Muted productivity growthwill limit gains in 
profitability, gains that would otherwise easily trigger an 
acceleration in investment. Profitability may also suffer 
from the delayed effects of the stronger exchange rate.

Exports: the income effect will smooth the impact of 
the lagged effect of the euro appreciation  
Imports of the world excluding the EU are expected to 
growat 9½% in 2004 and 8½% in 2005. Growth figures 
for GDP and trade for 2004 are boosted by substantial 
positive carry-over effects. The EU™s export markets are 

projected to grow at 7¼% in both 2004 and 2005, a pace 
not seen since 2000. However, it is unlikely that the EU 
will be able to benefit fully from the strength of the 
international environment. Given the technical 
assumptions regarding the exchange rates (see box 2.1 
for details), the nominal effective exchange rate of the 
euro area should appreciate by about 4¼% in 2004 (and 
by 7% for the EU). Nevertheless, the lagged effects of 
the exchange rate evolution on trade are important since 

several factors have the potential to attenuate or delay 
the exchange rate impact on exports: e.g. the inertia of 
contracts, hedging and billing behaviour.

An examination of past periods of appreciation in the 
nineties (1994-97 or 1997-1999) sugg
ests that euro-area 
exports underperformed world trade growth by about 5 
percentage points two years after the beginning of the 
appreciation phase.The EU might benefit from the strength of the 
international environment, as the income effect on trade 
flows is in general greater than the price effect. The 
impact arising from the increase in world demand is 

probably stronger than that stemming from the 
appreciation of the euro. The latter effect is likely to 
vary across the Member States according to the 

importance of exports to non-euro-area countries. 
Moreover, the extent of the impact of the euro 
appreciation is likely to be larger the greater the degree 

of openness of the country.  
Role of affiliates™ sales 
The international environmentdoes not only affect the 
EU economy through international trade. In the case of 
the US, substantial inflows of European foreign direct 
investment into the US have pushed domestic US sales 
by US affiliates of euro-area firms to 12.8% of euro area 

GDP in 2001. This is much larger than exports of goods 
and services to the US, which amounted to 3.8% of euro 
area GDP in 2001. Because of this exposure, the 
28Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU profitability and balance sheets of euro area companies 
were negatively affected by the US recession in 2001 
and the subsequent rise in the bilateral EUR/USD 
exchange rate. Conversely, the recent strong recovery of 

profitability in the US should help European firms, even 
taking into account the unfavourable exchange rate 
conversion effect. A similar case could probably be 

made for affiliates of European firms in Asia.

2.3. The balance of risks 
The balance of risks has moved to the downside 
recently. The main risks relate to consumption, 
investment and exports. 
Consumption  
The risks to consumption are skewed to the downside. 
There is a risk of a bubble in some European housing 
mark
ets, making consumer expenditure plans vulnerable 
to the consequences of interest-rate increases or 
declining house prices. Another downside risk is the 
persistence of negative confidence effects, stemming 

from the past stock market correction and from the 
uncertainties over the sustainability of pension and 
health care systems and government spending. 
Nevertheless, an upside risk lies in the release of larger-
than-assumed pent-up demand in combination with more 
favourable developments in real income growth and/or 
in wealth. If pent-up consumption demand were 

released, it could be financed through a reduction in the 
savings rate to historical levels. 
Investment 
The risks to investment are probably on the upside. The 
3.5% growth rate for 2004 investment is still only at its 
long-term average. Stronger-than-expected demand 
could bring capacity utilisation rates more rapidly to a 
level that triggers additional investment. In combination 

with faster technological progress and more favourable 
financing conditions, the elements are in place for even 
stronger investment growth.  
On the downside, demand developments could 
disappoint. External demand may suffer from a further 
strengthening of the euro exchange rate or from a fall-off 

in growth in the US or in China. Moreover, the 
acceleration in European private consumption may be 
slower than foreseen. 
Finally, the uncertainty regarding the adjustment of 
corporate balance-sheets is a risk in both directions: it 
may have advanced less or more than indicated by the 
present assessment, which is based on limited data 
availability.Exports (and affiliates™ sales) 
The strength and the sustainability of the global recovery 
are key risk factors for European export growth. An 
important role is played in this by the US household 
sector and the timing of its balance-sheet adjustment. 

The lagged impact of the euro appreciation on exports 
could also be larger than expected. The high level and 
increased volatility of oil prices has also the potential to 

dampen world demand.  
The evolution of profitability of affiliates™ operations is 
an upside risk for the health of European firms. 
European firms have, on average, large operations in the 
US and could, as a result, benefit from the strong 
profitability recovery in the US, even after an 

unfavourable exchange-rate conversion. A similar case 
could be made for European firms™ operations in Asia.  
293. Positive signs in the labour market
3.1. Recent developments  
The slowdown in economic activity has taken its toll 
on the labour market 
The euro-area labour market has gradually worsened 
since mid-2001, following the deceleration of economic 
activity with a relatively short lag. After years of strong 
job creation, employment growthfell below 1% (year-

on-year) in the fourth quarter of 2001, and has further 
decelerated since then. Employment (measured in terms 
of job-holders rather thanfull-time equivalents) 

remained unchanged in the third quarter of 2003, 
extending the period of broadly flat employment growth 
to one and a half years.  
The standardised unemployment rate in the euro area 
rose from 8% in the first quarter of 2001, when it 
reached its lowest level for the last 10 years, to 8.8% in 

the second quarter of 2003. Since then it has remained 
stable at that level, according to the latest available 
figure for February 2004.  
On the basis of the Commission Survey results, 
households™ unemployment expectationsimproved in 
the second half of 2003
 while remaining broadly 
unchanged at the beginning of 2004. All in all, labour 
market indicators have improved since the lows of the 
beginning of last year, but they remain soft. 
Net job creation continued in the services sector 
A breakdown of employment developments by sector 
shows that agriculture and industry have continued to 
lose jobs, while employment in the services sector has 

risen, albeit at a very modest pace of 0.2% (quarter-on-
quarter) since mid-2002.  
Survey data suggest thatoverall employment growth 
remained weak at the turn of the year. According to the 
last Commission Business Survey, employment 
expectations in manufacturing recorded only a limited 

improvement over the last six months. However, 
employment expectations were more positive in March 
2004 than in December of last year. By contrast, 

employment expectations in the Purchasing Managers' 
Index (PMI) weakened somewhat at the beginning of 
2004. For the services sector, such expectations 
improved in the fourth quarter and, according to the 
European Commission Survey, posted further gains in 
January and February 2004 before declining in March. 
The PMI paints a similar picture with a somewhat more 

marked deterioration at the beginning of 2004.

3.2. Employment growth picking up  
The euro-area labour market is expected to benefit from 
the turnaround and pickup in overall economic activity, 

which took place in the second half of last year. After 
almost two years of stagnation, higher growth rates for 

employment are projected, while the unemployment 
rate should start to decelerate. 
Despite the upturn in economic growth, however, 
employment is expected to grow only by 0.3% in 2004. 
Several factors support this outlook.  
First, it takes time before an improvement in economic 
activity is reflected in the labour market. In view of the 
usual lagged response, no significant rise in 
employment should be expected before the second half 

of this year. This is important since a recovery in the 
labour market is, in turn, a prerequisite for a revival in 
private consumption and thusfor a more broad-based 

recovery.Second, the acceleration of economic activity is 
expected to be fairly modestand insufficiently robust to 
create jobs on a large scale, in view of the weakness of 
domestic demand and the weak impetus from export 
growth. Should the strengthening of the euro continue, 
the tight control on labour costs, which are required by 
firms in order to remain competitive on both internal 

and export markets, would further delay the creation of 
new jobs.  30Chapter 2 The economy of the euro area and the EU
Third, the reduction of surplus capacity and cost-cutting 
in the corporate sector have left their mark. And, 
although rising corporate earnings suggest that the 
worst is probably over, firms still need to increase their 
profits, fully restore their balance sheets and achieve 

stronger productivity gains before being able to take on 
new workers on a sustained basis. 
Overall, the moderate increase in employment would 
translate into only 0.4 million new jobs in the euro area, 
which would nevertheless represent a turnaround 
compared to 2003. The unemployment rate is projected 

to remain at 8.8% in 2004, unchanged vis-à-vis last 
year. Hence, the moderate increase in employment 
would be offset by a higher number of people without a 

job - 12.4 million in absolute terms - and a higher 
labour force participation rate. 
In parallel with the usual 
upswing in economic activity, 
labour productivity is expected to recover, reaching a 
year-on-year growth rate of around 1.4% in 2004, 

compared to 0.4% in 2003.  
In 2005, employment is expected to rise more strongly, 
thereby providing an impulsefor stronger growth in 
domestic demand. Employment is projected to rise by 
0.9%, implying that about 1.2 million new jobs will be 
created. Due to the more sustained pace of the recovery, 
the unemployment rate is seen to decline, albeit 
marginally, to 8.6% compared to the previous year.  
However, the stronger pace of economic activity is not 
expected to lead to a significant tightening of the labour 
market as better job prospectsshould trigger the entry 
of individuals into the labour force, which is projected 

to increase by 0.8%. By contrast, labour productivity 
growth is expected to average 1.4% also in 2005, 
reflecting the beneficial effect of output on 

employment. 
The structural unemployment rate is estimated to be 
8.7% this year and should ease further to 8.5% in 2005, 
thus continuing the downward trend started in 1997 
when it was close to 10%. The employment rate, 

defined according to structural indicators as the share of 
the number of people aged 15-64 in the population of 
the same age group, is expected to reach a level of 

63.1% in 2005, in line with its historical upward trend 
initiated in the middle of the eighties.

The structural reforms undertaken over the past few 
years have made EU economies more resilient to 

shocks, but the employment goals of the Lisbon 
strategy have been seriously challenged by the strong 
impact of the economic downturn on the labour market 

situation. As the employment rate for the EU as a whole 
is projected at 64.6% for 2005, it is clear that the 
intermediate overall employment-rate target will be 

missed. Progress towards the 70% target for 2010 will 
depend crucially on the implementation of further 
labour market reforms.

31Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 As regards labour market developments across the EU 
Member States, employment growth in Spain, Ireland 

and Luxemburg is expected to be stronger than in the 
euro area in both 2004 and 2005. Austria and Greece 

will also exceed the euro area average in 2004, and 
Belgium will be in this position in 2005. By contrast, 
empl
oyment is set to contract in the Netherlands this 
year, before rising again in 2005. In France, Germany 
and Finland employment is projected to remain broadly 
stable this year and to accelerate somewhat in 2005. 

Outside the euro area, employment is forecast to decline 
in 2004 in Sweden, while remaining broadly unchanged 
in Denmark and rising by about 0.3% in the UK. In 

2005, the three countries should experience positive 
employment growth.

In both 2004 and 2005, Germany, Greece, Spain and 
France are expected to record an unemployment rate at 
or above the euro-area average. By contrast, 

unemployment rates at 6% or below are anticipated for 
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria, as 
well as the three non-euro-area Member States.
3.3. Downside risks from excessive labour 
market resilience?During the latest economic downturn (2001-2003), the 
euro area labour market showed greater resilience to the 
weakening of economic activity compared to past 
cycles. Despite below-trend economic growth since 
mid-2001, net job creation has remained positive. At 

the same time, the unemployment rate has worsened, 
although the rise has not been as great as might have 
been expected given the size and length of the 

downturn. Modest levels of economic activity for such 
an extended period of time would normally result in a 
higher level of job destruction and in a sharper increase 
in the unemployment rate.  
The greater resilience of the euro-area labour market is 
partly the result of changes in the European labour 
market over the second half of the 1990s, which have 
facilitated the development ofa more job-intensive 
economy and thus increased the job content of growth. 

These changes include a higher level of female 
participation in the labour market, a rising level of 
educational attainment of the workforce, greater 

availability of new types of working contracts, more 
employment-friendly wage setting, and cuts in non-
wage labour costs. Of course, the strong deceleration of 

economic activity and the resilience of employment 
implied a marked reduction in average labour 
productivity which, in turn, materialised into 

deterioration in unit labour costs and firms™ 
profitability.While there is no apparent obstacle to the recovery of 
employment as economic activity picks up, it may 
happen, nevertheless, that the labour market exhibits the 
same slow reaction during the upswing as during the 
downturn with firms replacing labour with capital. This 
would be the case, for instance, if the euro area 

followed the US lead and productivity rose to such an 
extent as to have an adverse effect on the demand for 
labour. While productivity on an hourly basis is 

probably increasing more than productivity per person, 
as a result of the labour market reforms introduced in 
previous years, there is noindication to date that 

productivity is now rising at a much stronger pace than 
in the past. 
324. Inflation falls below 2%
4.1. Recent developments  
Limited easing of headline inflation in 2003 
Despite falling below 2% in the middle of last year, 
HICP inflation remained slightly above this threshold 
for the remainder of the year. The turn of the year has 
shown more promise with a figure of 1.9% in January 

followed by a drop to 1.6% in February. The flash 
estimate for March is also 1.6%. However, the sharp 
decline in the recent headline figure is mainly due to 
special factors and does not fully reflect an 
improvement in the inflation outlook.  Overall, despite 
a marked slowdown in real economic growth and the 
appreciation of the euro during 2003, the outlook for 
inflation has improved only marginally to date.  
Temporary factors mattered– 
Part of this disappointing development was due to the 
temporary influence of food and energy prices, the most 

volatile components of inflation. In particular, 

unprocessed food prices have boosted inflation since 
last summer and were up by 2.9% in January 2004. 
Processed food prices rose by 3.3% on average last year 

and this pace of increase was broadly confirmed by the 
January and February figures. Energy prices rose by 
3.1% in 2003, while the contraction recorded in the first 

two months of 2004 was largely due to a strong base 
effect, since energy inflation was particularly high at 
the beginning of 2003. 
–but core inflation was also resilient Core inflation has not improved either: it remained 
stable at around 2.0% in the second half of 2003 and 

was at the same level in February 2004. In the services 

sector, inflation has been particularly sluggish in recent 
years and prices have been running at an annual pace of 
2.5% since last spring. While this development 
represents an improvement compared to the 3% 
recorded at the end of 2002, it also underlines the 

stickiness of inflation in the services sector. Among the 
different factors contributing to the downward rigidity 
of services inflation, low productivity growth and 

competition are widely recognized as important. The 
stickiness of wages, whichin the services sector 
represent a relatively significant cost component, is also 

a crucial factor. By contrast, producer price inflation 
remained moderate in the euro area in the second half 
of 2003 and fell to an annual rate of 0.3% in January 

2004. This means that the increase in producer prices 
was below 1.5% for the tenth consecutive month, 
indicating subdued price pressures at the producer level. 

The contrast between this decline and the stickiness in 
consumer prices also supports the view that the pass-
through from movements in the exchange rate to euro-

area consumer prices has proved to be weaker than 
expected.

Inflation differentials narrowed 
Over the last year, inflation differences within the euro 
area narrowed somewhat but there continues to be a 
broad spread of inflation rates across the constituent 
Member States. According to February 2004 figures, 
the harmonised inflation rate ranged from 0.4% in 

Finland to 2.6% in Greece.Headline inflation was 
above 2% in six out of the twelve euro area countries in 
February.  
4.2. Better prospects ahead 
The recovery in the euro area is expected to be very 
moderate, with GDP growth set to reach potential 
towards the end of 2004. The negative output gap in 
both 2004 and 2005 and the related weak pressures 
from wage demands should keep domestic inflation low 

throughout the projection period. Inflation should also 
continue to benefit in 2004 from the effects of the euro 
appreciation. Overall, inflation in the euro area is 

expected to average 1.8% in 2004, twenty basis points 
lower than envisaged in the Autumn forecast. It is 
expected to ease further to 1.6% in 2005, slightly below 

the Autumn projection. 
The short-term outlook for inflation benefits from 
the strong euro– 
Headline inflation is forecast to average 1.7% in the 
first quarter of 2004 and to rise gradually to 1.9% in the 

third quarter of 2004, before resuming a downward 
trend to reach 1.6% by the end of the forecasting 

period. In the first part of 2004, inflation in the euro 
area is expected to benefit from the lagged effects of the 
significant past appreciation of the euro, especially 

against the dollar. This will help to keep import prices 
low, containing rising energy prices in USD, thereby 
putting additional downward pressure on the overall 

inflation rate, on top of that stemming from the 
slackness in domestic demand. Consistent with this 
view, the import deflator for goods is projected to 

decline by 1.2% in 2004, after having declined by 1.4% 
in the previous year.

– but external price pressure is expected to stay low 
The technical assumption of a constant exchange rate 
implies that the beneficial effects of the currency 
appreciation will fade away slowly during 2004. 
However external price pressure is expected to remain 
fairly low over the whole forecast horizon. This 

implicitly assumes that the increased demand for 
commodities due to the world recovery will be matched 
by an increase in supply. For oil prices, in particular, 

this requires that there are no major disturbances to 
supply. Against this background, the implicit price 
index for imports is estimated to increase by only 0.6% 

in 2005. Hence, despite the reversal of the trend 
compared to the previous year, import prices are 
forecast to increase by less than the GDP deflator and 

the HICP index. 
Weak domestic price impulses 
On the domestic side, inflation pressures from the wage 
side are estimated to remain fairly subdued over the 
forecast period in view of several restraining factors.  
First, overall economic conditions are expected to be 
conducive to low inflation. This is mainly reflected by 
the size of the output gap, which is forecast to remain 

negative over the forecast period. According to the 
production function estimates,the output gap for the 
34Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EUeuro area is set at 1.4% of potential GDP in 2004 and 
only marginally lower, at 1.2%, in 2005.  
Second, as a result of the persistent slackness of 
demand, the situation in the labour market will continue 
to be weak. The unemployment rate is projected to 

remain broadly stable over the forecast horizon, even 
showing a slight deterioratio
n in 2004 comp
ared to the 
previous year, before recovering somewhat in 2005. Net 

job creation is projected to continue, but the growth rate 
of employment, especially this year, is expected to be 
very small.

Compensati
on per head
Third, given the persistence of weak economic 
conditions in the euro area and the lagged reaction of 
the labour market to the upswing, it seems unlikely that 

wages will represent a significant source of inflationary 
pressures. Consistent with this view, wage moderation 
is expected to continue inthe near term. The growth 
rate of nominal compensation of employee per head is 
projected to fall to 2.4% in 2004 (and 2.3% in 2005), 

down from an average increase of 2.8% in the previous 
three years. Since the projected decline in inflation is 
similar, the growth rate in real compensation per head is 

set to remain broadly unchanged compared to the recent 
past. The projected increase is 0.6% in 2004 and 0.7% 
in 2005. At the same time, the mark-up indicator, as 

proxied by the difference between the growth rate of the 
GDP deflator and that of unit labour costs, is expected 
to return to positive territory over the next two years, 

growing by 0.8% in 2004 and 0.7% in 2005.  
Fourth, unit labour costs rose above trend in recent 
years as growth of compensation increased and labour 
productivity fell. With the recovery gaining momentum, 
the cyclical pick-up oflabour productivity, from 0.5% 
in 2003 to around 1.4% over the forecast period, will 

allow a deceleration of unit labour costs, which are 
expected to rise by 1% in both 2004 and 2005. 
Inflation expectations in line with forecasts  
Short-run inflation expectations, as measured by the 
Commission Consumer Survey, have been coming 
down for most of 2003; the Survey indicator fell from a 
level of 16 in March to a level of 3 in December. 

Although such expectations picked up somewhat at the 
beginning of 2004 to stand at 6 in March, the current 
level remains well below the long-term average (1985-

2003) of 24. Long-term inflation expectations as 
measured by index-linked bonds (with an 8-year 
maturity) are also on a downward trend. Lastly, 

according the results of the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters conducted by the ECB in January 2004, 
inflation in 2004 is expected to average 1.8% in 2004 in 

the euro area and to ease to 1.7% in 2005. In turn, these 
figures are broadly in line with those reported in the 
March issue of Consensus Economics, which 
anticipates an inflation rateof 1.7% in 2004 and 1.9% 
in 2005.1.5

35Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004 Inflation differentials remain 
Inflation rates differ across euro-area Member States 
substantially. In 2004, the lowest inflation rate is 

forecast for Finland (0.4%) and the highest rate for 
Greece (3.4%). Four euro area Member States are 
projected to have an inflation rate above 2% in 2004: 

Greece, Spain, Ireland and Italy. Outside the euro area, 
inflation is foreseen at 1.6% in the UK, 1.5% in 
Denmark and 1.2% in Sweden. In 2005, the highest 
inflation rates are anticipated for Greece (3.5%), Spain 
and Ireland (2.3%) and Portugal (2.2%). For the 
remaining countries, including non-euro-area Member 
States, an inflation rate below 2% is projected.

365.Diverse fiscal developments5.1. No improvement in general 
government positionsAfter continuing their deterioration in 2003, the 
budgetary outcomes are expected to remain unchanged 
in 2004, for both the euro area and the EU as a whole, 

at 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. 
Among the fifteen Member States, only five are 
expected to have budgetary positions in surplus or close 

to balance in 2004. These are Belgium, Spain, Finland, 
Denmark and Sweden. In the euro area, six countries 

are forecast to have deficits exceeding 3% of GDP, 
namely Germany, Greece, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, and Portugal.  
In 2005, on an unchanged policy basis, only slight 
improvements in the general government balance are 
foreseen (of 0.1 pp and 0.2 pp for the euro area and the 

EU, respectively). France, Italy, Portugal and the 
Netherlands would continue to have a deficit above 3% 
of GDP.  -1.0

2001200220032004Compared with the updates of the Stability and 
Convergence Programmes, the Commission forecasts in 
general show a deterioration in the outlook for public 

finances. For 2005, apart from differences in growth 
profiles, this could be explained by the fact that the 
Commission™s forecasts are based on the ﬁno policy 
changeﬂ assumption, while the projections in the 

updates of the Stability and Convergence Programmes 
are based on announced policies, not all of which have 
yet been translated into specific measures.   
The sharp deterioration in the primary balance in the 
euro area, from a surplus of 4.2% of GDP in 2000 to 
0.8% of GDP in 2003, is not expected to be reversed in 
2004 (0.7% of GDP) and 2005 (0.8% of GDP).  The 
cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB)in the euro 

area is forecast to remain unchanged at 1.2% of GDP in 
both 2004 and 2005 (1.3% of GDP in 2003). This 
would imply a neutral fiscal stance over the forecast 

period.  
The debt situation  In 2003, gross debt as a percentage of GDP increased in 
several countries, bringing the debt-to-GDP ratio for the 
euro area to 70.4% from 69.2% in 2002. In 2004, this 

ratio is expected to increase further, to 70.9% of GDP. 
This is, to a large extent, the result of the rising debt 
ratios foreseen in Germany and France (from 64.2% to 

65.6% in the former and 63% to 64.6% in the latter).  
Among the high debt countries, Belgium will continue 
to see its debt-to-GDP ratio decline below 100%. By 
contrast, on current policies, the debt ratio would halt 
its decline in Italy and remain, at 106% of GDP, the 
highest in the euro area and the EU.  
In Greece, subject to a special caveat related to the 
corresponding deficit figures, the debt ratio is expected 
to decline only slightly over the forecast period (from 
103% to 101.7% of GDP). Reflecting the differences in 
the deficit projections, the debt-to-GDP ratios for the 

euro area and the EU are slightly lower, according to 
the 2003 updates of the Stability and Convergence 
Programmes, than in the Commission™s forecasts in 

both 2004 and 2005. For the euro area, a debt-to-GDP 
ratio of 70.9% is forecast for both 2004 and 2005. The 
corresponding figure for the EU as a whole is 64.2%. 
37Economic Forecasts, Spring 2004    
Composition of government accounts  
The widening of the general government deficit in 2003 
was mainly due to an increase in expenditure. In the 
euro area, expenditure increased from 48.4% of GDP in 

2002 to 49% of GDP, while revenues rose at the same 
time by 0.2 percentage point to reach 46.3% of GDP in 
2003. For the forecast period, revenues are expected to 
decline to 45.8% of GDP in 2004 and 45.5% of GDP in 
2005 in the euro area.  The expenditure-to-GDP ratio in 

the euro area is forecast to decline in both 2004 and 
2005 in terms of GDP to 48.6% and 48.1% 
respectively.Over the forecast period, interest expenditure in the 
euro area is expected to remain broadly unchanged, 
moving from 3.5% of GDP in 2003 for the euro area to 
3.4% of GDP in both 2004 and 2005. 
5.2. Countries with high deficits  
In addition to Germany and France, the Netherlands and 
the United Kingdom saw their budget deficits exceed 
the 3% of GDP threshold in 2003. On current policies, 

the deficits are foreseen toremain above 3% of GDP in 
all these countries in 2004, with the exception of the 
UK.  
In Italy, the deficit in 2003 was 2.4% of GDP, almost 
unchanged compared to 2002 (2.3%). The deficit 
increase was curbed through recourse to one-off 
measures. Reflecting the expiration of such one-off 
measures, the deficit is foreseen to rise above 3% of 
GDP from 2004.  
The effect of one-off deficit-reducing measures on 2003 
also accounts for the reduction of the deficit below 3% 
of GDP in 2003 in Portugal and its rebound above it 

from 2004.  Finally, the budgetdeficit is foreseen in 
2004 to exceed the 3% of GDP threshold also in 
Greece.  The forecast is based on the sharply revised 

3.0% of GDP deficit for 2003 communicated by the 
government, which is currently being scrutinised by 
Eurostat and subject to possible further revisions. 
In 2005, on the basis of unchanged policies, the deficit 
is foreseen to rise further in Portugal and Italy. It should 
decline slightly, while remaining above the 3% of GDP 

threshold, in France and the Netherlands. For Germany, 
the fall should take the deficit below 3% of GDP.

391. Belgium Moderate recovery ahead The situation in 2003  
After two years of economic growth below 1%, the 
Belgian economy staged a recovery in the second half 
of 2003. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 

1.1% in the whole year, a figure higher than those of 
the neighbouring countries. In 2003 economic growth 
was led by domestic demand whereas the external 

contribution was markedly negative, owing to low 
external demand and losses in competitiveness against 
non-EU countries. Private consumption increased by 

1.7% and hence considerably faster than disposable 
income, which rose by 0.7%. This development is 
reflected in a substantial decline in the households™ 
savings rate spurred by a steady improvement in 
consumer confidence and possibly some catching-up, 

after two years of quite subdued consumption. 
Investment recovered from -2.5% in 2002 to 1.8% in 
2003, under the impact of better business 

expectations, improving profit margins and 
continuous low cost of capital. Employment fell again 
last year, by 0.5%, as it has been reacting with a lag to 

the economic downturn. Despite the exchange rate 
appreciation and weak final demand, inflation 
remained somewhat resilientin the downturn. HICP 

inflation fell by only one decimal point in 2003, to 
1.5%.  
Prospects for 2004 and 2005  
The recovery that started in the second half of 2003 is 
expected to strengthen moderately in 2004 and 2005, 
mainly driven by stronger external demand.  
It is assumed that the households™ savings rate would 
stabilise in the forecast period. However, the 
significant increase in real disposable income would 

secure a continued growth of private consumption in 
2004 and 2005. The increase in disposable income, 
somewhat stronger in 2005 than in 2004, is due to 

higher wage increases, the income tax reform and a 
more favourable employment development.  
Given the strengthening of final demand and 
historically low interest rates, investment would 
accelerate further. However, the rate of capacity 
utilisation is still relatively low and the expansion of 

investment is likely to remain modest, at least in 
2004.Hence, in 2004 and 2005 both domestic and external 
demand would contribute to growth in a more 

balanced way than in 2003.  
Labour market, costs and prices  
Employment has fallen steadily since mid 2001, 
leading to an increase in the unemployment rate by 2 
percentage points, to 8.5% in February 2004. 

Employment should increase in 2004 and more 
substantially in 2005, which would result in a decline 
in the unemployment rate in 2005. This is due to the 

recovery and is supported by reductions in social 
contributions and continued moderate wage increases.  
The latest inter-sectoral wage agreement, covering 

2003 and 2004, set wage costincreases considerably 
lower than in previous years. It has fixed an upper 
limit of 5.4% cumulated for both years, but given the 
slack in the labour market, the reductions in social 
contributions and lower-than-expected inflation this 

limit is unlikely to be reached. In this context of 
relatively modest unit labour cost increases, the 
impact of the appreciation of the euro, low interest 

rates and the abolition/reduction of the radio and 
television license fees is expected to keep inflation 
low in 2004. The effect of the exchange rate 

appreciation should fade out in 2005, at the same time 
as unit labour costs increase faster, the economy 
approaches potential output and the effect of reduced 

radio and TV fees is exhausted. All in all, this would 
translate into slightly higher inflation in 2005.

40Chapter 3 Member States, BelgiumPublic finances 
The general government accounts are estimated to 
have posted a surplus of0.2% of GDP in 2003. 
However, this surplus was only possible due to 

substantial one-off measures, amounting to 1.2% of 
GDP in net terms. For 2004, a deficit of 0.5% of GDP 
is forecast. However, this figure also takes into 

account one-off measures of about 0.5% of GDP (the 
temporary tax regulation is not included). Thus, there 
is an underlying (excluding one-off measures) deficit 

of 1% of GDP in 2004, despite the cyclical 
improvement. This development is due to the 
continued impact of the income tax reform, reduced 
social contributions and a rapid increase in health 
costs. These factors also have an impact on the budget 

in 2005. However, thanks to a better cyclical position 
and a still-lower interest expenditure, the deterioration 
in the budget deficit in 2005 is expected to be 

contained. A more pronounced deterioration would 
however take place in terms of the cyclically adjusted 
balance in 2005.  
The debt ratio is projected to fall this year and next, 
coming below 100% already in 2004. However, there 

is some uncertainty in this respect as the value of the 
debt of the SNCB (Railway Company) that the 
authorities would take over next year is still unknown 

and this operation has therefore not been taken into 
account.  Table 3.1

412. Denmark Steady recovery after zero growth The economy in 2003 
Economic activity in Denmark stagnated in 2003, and 
GDP growth for the year as a whole was zero. With 
two quarters of negative growth in the middle of the 

year, the economy was indeed in a technical 
recession. During the first three quarters of 2003, 
private consumption was sluggish, with significant 

falls in car sales. Business investments saw a sharp 
downturn in the second quarter, which can be linked 
to the geopolitical uncertainties, followed by a 

rebound in the third quarter. In the light of weak 
external demand and the effective appreciation of the 
krone, Danish exports were subdued. 
The fourth quarter brought a changed picture. 
Domestic demand increased vigorously, led by private 
consumption which rose by 1¾% per cent on the 

quarter. Equipment and construction investments also 
expanded robustly, while software investments fell. 
Overall, the recovery in investments in the last part of 

the year was insufficient to stop total investments 
from falling markedly for the year as a whole. Exports 
also started to pick up in the fourth quarter. The 

recovery of domestic demand in the fourth quarter, 
was, however, largely offset by a markedly negative 
growth contribution from net exports, as imports grew 

strongly. The year thus ended on an overall positive 
note, paving the way for an assumed improved growth 
picture in 20
04 and 2005. 
Prospects in 2004and 2005  
Continuing the upswing from the end of 2003, private 
consumption should lead domestic demand to a 
marked recovery of economic activity in 2004. A 

number of factors contribute to boosting disposable 
incomes this year, laying the ground for a recovery of 
consumption: the full income tax cuts of the tax 

reform, the suspension of contributions to a 
mandatory savings scheme and reductions of excise 
duties on alcohol, tobacco and soft drinks. In addition, 

the very low inflation will enhance real disposable 
income and interest rates are set to remain low. 
Against this background, private consumption, which 
has been subdued for a number of years, is expected 
to grow vigorously, in particular in 2004.  
With indust
ry confidence indicators pointing 
upwards, business investments should continue the 
recovery in the first half of 2004, albeit growing 
slightly less than overall production for the year as a 

whole. On the back of increased overall demand, 
investment growth shouldthen gather strength 
gradually in 2005.As global markets are set to expand in the forecast 
period, Denmark's exports are foreseen to recover in 
2004, but to grow less than export markets, resulting 
in a loss of market shares. Danish exports of goods 

are thus expected to grow by some 3% in 2004, 
increasing to 4¼% in 2005. Imports are foreseen to 
rise somewhat more than exports in 2004 and 2005, 

implying, respectively, a slightlynegative and slightly 
positive contribution to GDP growth from net exports 
in the two years. All in all, the recovery of domestic 
demand should provide for 
a GDP growth of just 
above 2% in 2004 and 2005.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market weakened in 2003 as GDP growth 
stagnated. Employment fell markedly and 
unemployment increased to around 6 per cent of the 
labour force. As the expansion of economic activity 

gathers momentum in 2004, employment is set to 
increase again, but only with some lag. 
Unemployment should therefore peak in the second 

half of 2004, and decline gradually over the rest of the 
forecast period. -1012345679495

42Chapter 3, Member States, Denmark In a context of increasing slack on the labour market, 
statutory wage growth coming out the private sector 
wage negotiations in early 2004 point to a somewhat 

decelerating wage growth. However, wage growth is 
still higher than in the euro area. The average HICP inflation in Denmark in 2003 was 
2%. Towards the end of the year, consumer price 

inflation decelerated markedly and in early 2004, 
annual inflation was below 1%. This development is 
mainly due to falling import prices and energy prices. 
In addition, the reduction of excise duties on alcohol, 
tobacco and soft drinks in late 2003 will contribute to 
lower consumer price inflation in 2004. With some 
slack in the economy, inflation should overall 
continue to be low in the forecast period, with an 

average HICP rate of 1½% in 2004. However, 
inflation is set to increase somewhat at the end of the 
period as the effects of falling import prices and the 

cuts in excise duties disappear. 
Public finances  
In spite of the weak economic activity in2003, the 
general government balance recorded a surplus of 
1½% of GDP. In 2004, the general government 

surplus-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline somewhat. 
The positive effects on revenues from increased GDP 
growth are largely offset by lower tax revenues due to 

the implementation of the tax reform. Expenditure 
related to unemployment will increase for the year as 
a whole. In 2005, a slightly higher general 

government surplus is foreseen as GDP growth is 
somewhat stronger and public expenditure reduced as 
the situation on the labour market improves. The 
government gross debt, which stood at 45% of GDP 
at the end of 2003, is set to fall to some 40% of GDP 

by 2005.   Table 3.2

433. Germany  
The economy has started to grow again 
The situation in 2003  
Growth in Germany has turned mildly positive in the 
second half to 2003, after a slight contraction in the 
first half of the year. Following the typical pattern of 

German recoveries, an acceleration in export growth 
provided a strong impulse likely to end the three-year-
long stagnation, despite a still anaemic or even falling 

final domestic demand. While private consumption 
continued to decline intothe fourth quarter, a 
brightened outlook has led to a remarkable turnaround 

in equipment investment, which after falling by one-
fifth over the last three years started heading up again.  
The end-of-year pick-up was, however, too weak for 
overall GDP growth to resume in 2003. It edged down 
by 0.1%, as a result of a sizable decline in both final 
domestic demand and net exports that was largely 

offset by a strong contribution from stocks. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
Despite the negative overall growth in 2003, the year 
witnessed a number of changes that justify a more 
optimistic outlook for 2004. Germany™s exports 

benefit strongly from an accelerating world economy. 
Export demand has so far not been visibly dampened 
by the strong euro. Economic sentiment indicators, as 

well as the stock market, reflect a significantly more 
positive outlook than several months ago, although 
expectations have recently been toned down to fall 

closer in line with the present situation.    
On this basis, a gradual recovery should take hold 
over the next two years. Growth will gather 
momentum only gradually, as constraints start to ease. 
GDP growth is projected at 1.5% in 2004 and 1.8% in 

2005. These figures understate the expected 
acceleration, because the profile is dominated by a 
positive calendar effect of ½ percentage point in the 

current leap year, which will be partly reversed next 
year.At least initially, strong export demand should be the 
main driver, as order volumes for investment goods 
rose strongly. It is to be expected, however, that the 
strong euro will dampen export demand starting from 
the middle of the year. After that, export growth may 
be outstripped by imports, as an accelerating domestic 
demand replaces the external contribution as the main 

source of growth.  
Domestic demand growth is likely to be broad-based. 
Equipment investment, which in recent years was 
largely confined to replacement, is picking up 

strongly and even the notoriously depressed 
construction sector will benefit somewhat from 
activity carried forward inanticipation of a subsidy 

being phased out. 
Private consumption is also expected to resume, after 
bleak economic prospects led households to hold back 
spending even beyond the stagnation in real 
disposable income. The income tax reductions in 
January 2004 and 2005, rising consumer confidence 
and a sizable pent-up demandshould be conducive to 

the expected turn-around in consumption. While 
reforms in the labour market, pensions and the health 
care sector might dampen the drive for consumption, 
such reforms should nevertheless prove crucial in 
supporting the economic upswing, as they increase 

industrial confidence, lower the social contribution 
burden and increase flexibility in an anaemic labour 
market.Labour market, costs and prices 
Already, labour market reforms have led to a sizable 
creation of mini-jobs and will become more effective 
as the economy picks up momentum. The creation of 
a low wage sector should also have positive spill-over 

effects on the rest of the economy. Related to this and 
to the high level of unemployment, the increase in 
effective wages will continue to be moderate and in 

line with productivity increases. Domestic 
inflationary pressure will therefore be very low, and

44Chapter 3 Member States, Germany Germany would continue to gain in price 
competitiveness vis-à-vis its European trading 
partners. This, together with a drop in import prices, 

should keep headline inflation below 1% annually 
were it not for special factors like the impact of the 
health care reform and increases in tobacco taxes.   
Public finances 
In 2003 the general government deficit widened from 
3.5% to 3.9% of GDP, mainly due to growth turning 
out lower than expected. This was countered to some 
extent by consolidation measures introduced in 2003. 
In particular, social security contributions were raised 
and benefits to public sector employees were cut.  
Legislation adopted in 1999 and 2000 committed 
Germany to several steps of income tax relief until 
2005. The two steps taking effect in 2004 and 2005 
will be partly counter-financed by a broadening of the 

tax base. 
Within the reform programme ﬁAgenda 2010ﬂ 
designed by the German government and following 
the negotiations of the parliamentary Mediation 
Committee, a package of consolidation measures for 
the social transfer systems as well as cuts in subsidies 

and other transfers to households were passed into 
law in 2003. As their implementation will be 
continuing into 2005, the government expenditure 

share is predicted to be falling in 2004 and 2005. 
Budgetary risks in 2004 mainly derive from some 
one-time measures such as the tax amnesty that might 
be less successful than planned, the postponed road 

toll for lorries and an unexpectedly low Bundesbank 
profit. The budgetary risks for 2005 result mainly 
from growth possibly being lower than expected by 
the German authorities. In 2004, the deficit will 
continue to be well above 3% of GDP. In 2005, the 

deficit is expected to fall below the reference value by 
a small margin. If growth turns out lower than 
forecast or if the structural measures do not have the 

expected budgetary effects, Germany clearly risks 
breaching, on unchanged policies, the 3% of GDP 
ceiling once more.

454 Greece 
Despite strong growth, progress in fiscal consolidation is postponed Economic activity in 2003  
The economy continued to be buoyant in 2003, with 
real GDP growth estimated at 4.2%. Growth was 
driven by domestic demand, in particular investment 

in construction, linked to the preparation of the 2004 
Olympic Games and assistedby financial flows from 
the EU Structural Funds. Private consumption, 

buttressed by easy monetary conditions and an 
improvement in disposable income, has also been a 
significant contributor toGDP growth. Owing to a 

sharp acceleration of imports, the current account 
deficit appears to have widened further in 2003, 
although export activity has started to recover.  
The unemployment rate, still among the highest in the 
EU, was slightly reduced as employment growth 
started to respond to booming economic activity in 

recent quarters. Compensation per head slowed down 
partly due to the implementation of the 2002 wage 
agreement in the private sector. Inflation 

developments in 2003 point to the non-tradable sector 
and weather-related price increases in unprocessed 
food as the main sources of price pressures. Consumer 

prices growth averaged 3.5% in the year. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005  
The economy is expected to continue to grow at fast 
rates in 2004 while a deceleration in economic 
activity is projected for 2005. The main factors that 

will contribute to growth in 2004 are still strong 
domestic demand and the recovery of the European 
economy. Private consumption, supported by easy 
monetary conditions, is expected to continue to grow 
at a sustained pace to the forecast horizon, as a result 

of an increase in disposable income due to the 2002 
tax reforms and the 2003 social package. Investment 
should continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate 

than in 2003, as investment associated with the 
Olympic Games will still be realized in the first half 
of 2004. However, the expected improvement of the 

international environment from 2004, the assumed 
low interest rates and continued financial flows from 
the EU Structural Funds may helpin keeping 
economic activity relatively buoyant throughout the 
forecasting period. The current account deficit is expected to narrow 
temporarily in 2004 as exports, in particular of 
services, are expected to increase considerably due to 
the international economic recovery and the Olympic 

Games. On the other hand, imports should slow down 
due to a relative deceleration of investment. 
Nonetheless, private consumption is expected to 

continue to be sustainedby positive increases in 
disposable income and low interest rates, implying 
strong import growth throughout the forecasting 

period. As a result, the negative contribution of the 
external balance should narrow in 2004 but increase 
again in 2005, due to underlying macroeconomic 

imbalances and competitiveness losses. 
Costs and prices  
Consumer prices are expected to rise at a fast pace, 
with consumer price inflation (national definition) 
averaging marginally below 3.5% until the end of the 
forecasting period. While the contribution of imported 
inflation should remain small, wage developments are 

quite uncertain, as the negotiations for the new 
collective wage agreement have just started. The 
generous wage increases in the public sector may 

adversely affect the outcome of the negotiations. 
Finally, the output gap, albeit narrowing, is expected 
to remain positive. 
Public finances  
Despite strong growth, the situation of public finances 
worsened considerably as implementation of the 2003 
State budget was completely off track.

46Chapter 3 Member States, GreeceAlthough partly attributable to some extraordinary 
factors (the preparation of the Olympic Games, 
compensation for weather damage), the overshooting 

compared with the budget target suggests a lack of 
control over primary spending (social transfers and 
public sector wages) while budget revenues also fell 

short of projections. 
 The estimated budgetary outcome in 2003 is 
characterised by great uncertainty, with obvious 
implications for the making of 2004 budgetary 
projections. In a first EDP notification (1 March 
2004), the general government deficit in 2003 was 
estimated at 1.7% of GDP against a target of 0.9% of 
GDP. Eurostat considered the data as provisional and 
subject to revision, due to ongoing discussion with the 

authorities in Greece. According to a second EDP 
notification (30 March), the general government 
deficit was revised upwards to 3%; the new figures 

are being scrutinised by Eurostat and not yet 
validated. The Commission forecast is built on this 
latest estimate of the 2003 deficit communicated by 
the Greek authorities, although by no means does it 
represent a validation of this deficit figure.  
Under the usual assumption of unchanged policy, the 
Commission forecasts a further deterioration in the 

budgetary position of the general government in 2004. 
This is due, first, to the significant base-year effects 
for 2004 from the higher deficit in 2003; second, to 

the impact of the 2003 social package (estimated at 
over 1% of GDP for 2004), which seems to have been 
understated in the expenditure projections; and 

finally, to the lower than officially projected growth 
in tax revenues, given the recent tax reforms. A 
marginal improvement is expected in 2005, assuming 
that some primary expenditure related to the 
preparation of the Olympic Games will not be 

recurring in 2005. The primary surplus should 
continue to shrink in 2004 while the debt ratio is 
expected to decline, albeit at a slow pace, given the 

still high stock-flow adjustments and debt-increasing 
financial transactions.

475. Spain Growth gains momentum in 2004 
Economic developments in 2003 
In 2003, real GDP grew by 2.4%, marginally above 
the Commission™s autumn forecast. The main forces 
driving economic activity were private consumption 

and investment in dwellings, while the external sector 
posted a negative contribution to GDP growth of 1 
percentage point. Growth was noticeably firm in the 

final quarter due to buoyant private consumption and 
a less negative external contribution, which involves a 
sizeable carry-over effect for 2004. In contrast, 

investment in equipment remained almost flat.  
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
A slight deceleration on a quarterly basis is envisaged 
for the first quarter of 2004. Confidence indicators 

remain mixed and industrial production fell sharply at 
the beginning of the year. On the other hand, 
mortgage borrowing is accelerating. From the third 
quarter onwards, final demand is envisaged to gain 
dynamism, mainly due to growth of investment in 
equipment and of exports.  
In 2004 as a whole, private consumption is envisaged 
to remain robust. Sound employment growth and 
residual impulses from the personal income tax cut 
implemented in 2003 coupled with lower inflation 

rates will sustain consumption while still allowing a 
rise in the saving ratio. The latter should help 
strengthen the financial position of households after 

the growing indebtedness registered in recent years, 
and inhibit a further acceleration of consumer 
spending. These trends are expected to persist in 
2005.Based on a more positive international outlook and 
better business prospects, investment is foreseen to 

gain dynamism in 2004 and 2005, mainly due to 
stronger investment in equipment linked to a great 
extent to accelerating exports, which should more 

than offset the moderation envisaged for dwellings. 
The relatively healthy financial position of firms and 
rising profitability should help foster a recovery of 

investment in equipment.On the other hand, the 
forecast deceleration of construction is based on two 
elements, namely the weaker financial position of 
households deterring residential investment and less 
dynamic public investment linked to the electoral 

cycle.The external sector is set to recover vigour during the 
forecast period stemming from the envisaged 
recovery of Spain™s main trading partners. Both 

exports and imports are expected to accelerate, which 
should entail a more moderate drag from the external 
sector.As result, output growth is expected to gain 
dynamism and further accelerate to 2.8% in 2004, 
accelerating slightly from the second quarter of the 
year in quarterly terms. Based on higher investment in 
equipment and exports of goods and services, real 
GDP in 2005 is forecast to accelerate at the end of the 
year and grow by 3.3% on average, slightly above 

poten
tial.Labour market 
Following the economic upturn throughout the 
forecasting period, employment creation should grow 

above 2% in terms of full-time equivalent jobs in both 
2004 and 2005. Notwithstanding the envisaged 
increase in the active population, strong employment 

creation should help reduce unemployment to rates 
below 11
.0% and 10.5% in 2004 and 2005, 
respectively (EUROSTAT definition). 
Costs and prices 
Both headline and core inflation are expected to 
moderate significantly in the first quarter of 2004 and 
pick-up slightly thereafter. On average, HICP 
inflation is expected to ease to 2.4% in 2004 (3.1% in 

2003) and to fall marginallyfurther to 2.3% in 2005,

GDP48Chapter 3 Member States, Spainprovided the envisaged wage moderation is 
confirmed. Thus, compensation per head should 
decelerate in 2004 and 2005, supported by a much 

lower impact of wage indexation clauses. This wage 
moderation coupled with a rise in apparent labour 
productivity should imply decelerating unit labour 

costs in the projection period.  
External sector 
The current account deficit is forecast to widen further 
in 2004 and 2005. This deterioration stems mainly 
from the growing trade deficit, only partially offset by 
the services balance surplus.The trade deficit in turn 
reflects relatively higher domestic demand growth 

than in export markets, combined with ongoing 
worsening in cost competitiveness. 
Public finances 
In 2003, despite personal income tax cuts, the general 
government balance achieved a better result than 

expected, registering a surplus of 0.3% of GDP. The 
fiscal forecast, particularly that for 2005, is clearly 
subject to policy changes that could be announced by 
the new government that gained office following the 

March 2003 general election. On the basis of policies 
as announced by the outgoing government, in 2004 
indirect taxes and social security contributions are 
expected to remain buoyant, supported by strong job 
creation, while growth of direct tax revenue should 
regain some strength after the tax reform implemented 

in 2003, with corporate tax revenue expected to 
respond to firms™ higher profits. These elements 
together with moderate growth of expenditure items 
should enable the general government to register a 
surplus of 0.4% of GDP. In 2005 the government 

budget balance is foreseen to show a surplus of 0.6% 
of GDP. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
continue to decline during the forecasting period, 

falling to around 45% of GDP by end-2005.

496. France The recovery is under way The economic situation in 2003  
Withan increase of 0.2%, real GDP experienced in 
2003 its worst performance since the 1993 recession 
(-0.9%). The slowdown in economic activity was 

primarily due to the sharp deterioration of the 
contribution of net exports to growth. However, the 
low growth figure hides a highly contrasted profile 

within 2003. After having skirted the recession in the 
first half of 2003, the French economy picked up in 
the second half of the year, when growth reached an 

annualised rate of about 2%. This acceleration was 
driven by a rebound in exports, after one year of 
continuous decline, and a pick up in demand from 
firms. In particular, private companies increased their 
investment flow for the first time in two years.  
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
Recent business surveys confirm that a recovery is 
under way. In particular, business sentiment improved 
markedly in the service and the building sectors in 
recent months. In the manufacturing sector, 

expectations are also oriented upward, but their 
improvement seems more hesitant. In contrast with 
developments of business sentiment, consumer 

confidence has remained very low. French consumers 
are in particular concerned by developments in the 
labour market. All in all, developments in surveys are 

consistent with growth stabilising at a close to 
potential rate in the next few months. 
On the back of the assumed improvement in the world 
economy and favourable monetary conditions, the 
recovery of economic activity in France is expected to 
develop further in 2004 and 2005. Real GDP growth 
would resume to an above potential rate from next 
summer onwards with annual rates reaching 1.7% in 
2004 and 2.4% in 2005. 
The acceleration of exports would continue to support 
an upturn in demand expectations, and lead 
companies to reverse the ongoing de-stocking 
movement. In addition, equipment investment is 
expected to accelerate gradually. This development 
would also be supported by favourable financing 
conditions, reflecting the low level of interest rates, 

and by the introduction of tax incentives (abolition of 
thetaxe professionnelle
on new capital expenditure). The need for companies to adjust their balance sheets 
will however moderate the pick up in investment 
growth in the next few quarters.  
The recovery of private consumption would be more 
gradual. Indeed, the increasein real gross disposal 
income of households is projected to remain subdued 
in 2004, before accelerating significantly in 2005 in 

line with a rebound in employment. The saving ratio 
ofhouseholds is projected to edge down slightly in 
the next two years. 
 Labour markets, costs and prices  
The past deterioration of economic activity is still 
impacting on the labour market: employment growth 
remains weak and it is not expected to accelerate 
significantly before next summer. The need for 

companies to restore their profit margins will 
probably delay the recovery in employment. The 
cyclical acceleration of productivity would therefore 

be particularly pronounced in 2004. 
Wage moderation is projectedto continue in 2004. 
This year, the impact of the harmonisation of the 

different levels of minimum wage created by the 
working time reduction laws will be counter-balanced 
by a cyclical deceleration in wages. A slight 

acceleration in real wages would occur in 2005, 
driven by the decline in the unemployment rate. 
As a consequence of the moderation in unit labour 
costs expected for 2004 and 2005, underlying 

inflationary pressures are projected to remain 
subdued. The profile of consumer price inflation will 
however be strongly influenced by fluctuations in 

tobacco prices, which will increase the annual 
inflation rate by 0.5 percentage point in 2004, and by 
0.1 percentage point in 2005.

50Chapter 3 Member States, FrancePublic finances  
In 2003, the situation of French public finances 
deteriorated markedly, mainlydue to growth turning 
out lower than expected. The general government 

deficit increased from 3.2% of GDP in 2002 to 4.1% 
of GDP in 2003. Due to the increase in the deficit, but 
also to low growth in nominal GDP and to debt-

increasing stock-flow adjustments amounting to 1.3 
percentage points of GDP, the general government 
gross debt-to-GDP ratio rose by 4.4 percentage points 

in 2003 to 63.0 percent of GDP.  
In 2004, the general government deficit is projected to 
decline from 4.1% of GDP to 3.7% of GDP. This 

decline will be hampered by the lagged impact on 
fiscal revenues of the low 2003 real GDP growth. In 
this forecast, it is assumedthat expenditure plans 
included in the Finance Law for 2004 will be 
respected, except for a slippage in health 
expenditures. On the revenue side, the forecast 

incorporates discretionary tax increases amounting to 
0.15 percentage point of GDP. Based on the 
commonly agreed methodology for the calculation of 
potential output, this forecast is consistent with a 

decline in the cyclically-adjusted deficit by about 0.5 
percentage point of GDP in 2004.  
In 2005, the general government deficit is projected to 
decrease only marginally to 3.6% of GDP. Real 

general government expend
iture is projected to 
increase by 2.2% in real termsin 2005, in line with 
the trend observed in the last five years. This forecast 

does not incorporate the potential positive impact of 
the reform of the health insurance system that is 
currently being designed.

517. Ireland 
Abroad-based recovery is under wayActivity in 2003  
In line with preliminary national accounts for the first 
three quarters, real GDP growth is estimated to have 
averaged just above 1% in year 2003, representing a 

marked slowdown on 2002 (6.9%) and 2001 (6.2%). 
Consumption growth remained relatively healthy but 
there was a pronounced fall in all categories of 

investment bar housing. Overall domestic demand 
was therefore quite subdued. The dramatic drop in 
both exports and imports must be qualified as there 

was a very marked fall-off in merchandise trade with 
the UK, assumed to be related to the termination of 
UK-based VAT fraud schemes in the course of 2002. 
The external side is estimated to have made a fairly 
weak contribution to overall growth compared to 

previous years. Growth in real GNI terms seems to have been much 
more buoyant in 2003 than in real GDP terms, on 
account of a decline in net factor outflows. This is 

exactly the opposite of the pattern observed in 2002, 
when real GDP growth pointed to a remarkable 
expansion (concentrated in the chemicals sector) in 

spite of the worldwide slowdown. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
The Irish economy is expected to post a broad-based 
recovery over the forecast horizon. Real GDP growth 
is projected to reach 3.7% in 2004 and to strengthen 

to 4.6% in 2005, close to the rate commonly thought 
to be sustainable in the medium term, of up to 5%.  
On the domestic side, private consumption is 
expected to benefit from nominal disposable income

growth compared 
to euroarea 
                   and contributions to change
gains (albeit more moderate than in recent years) and 
a lower inflation rate than in the recent past. The 
contribution from public consumption should remain 

modest in view of further spending restraint and the 
envisaged cut in public sector employment. 
Investment in equipment should pick up in line with 

the general recovery, while construction is supported 
by significant public capital spending under the 
National Development Plan after a pause in 2003. 

However, growth in housing completions is expected 
to taper off after double-digit growth in 2003. 
Building on the regained momentum of the last 
months of 2003, merchandise exports are expected to 
stage a strong recovery in line with the international 
upturn.  External trade in services is also projected to 

return to the more dynamic growth rates of the period 
before 2003. Labour market 
The labour market was remarkably resilient in 2003 
with a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 4.6% 

from 4.3% in 2002. Employment is estimated to have 
grown 1¾% but about two-thirds of the net gains are 
accounted for by the public sector. In view of the 

aforementioned cut in public sector employment, this 
will not be repeated over the forecast period. As a 
result, employment gains will be quite weak in 2004, 

while unemployment is projected to rise to some 5% 
before easing slightly the year after. Costs and prices 
The available data for the first three quarters of 2003 
suggest that there has been no further moderation of 
per capita compensation growth since about mid-
2002, when it broadly halved compared to a year 
earlier. Average income growth is thus estimated at 
around 5% on the year in 2003 and a similar rate is 
projected for 2004. Some further easing in the private 

sector in view of moderating inflationary pressures is 
expected to be partly offsetby strong wage growth in 
the public sector given the gradual implementation of 

ﬁbenchmarkingﬂ (upward adjustments to public sector 
pay scales based on comparison with rates for similar 
jobs in the private sector). 
52Chapter 3 Member States, IrelandHICP inflation averaged 4.0% in 2003, down from 
4.7% in 2002. With downward pressures stemming 
from weak activity and a stronger currency, the 

annual rate eased significantly through 2003, from 
4.7% in January to 2.9% in December. HICP inflation 
averaged 2.3% in the first two months of 2004 and is 

projected to trough in the third quarter before picking 
up in response to strengthening economic activity. 
HICP inflation is thus forecast to average 2.1% in 

2004 and 2.3% in 2005. This would considerably 
narrow the positive inflation differential with the euro 
area.Public finances 
The main measures in the budget for 2004 are a 
further reduction of the growth rate of current 
discretionary expenditure (to 7.5% from 9.5% in 
2003), a return to positive growth in discretionary 

capital spending after the cut in 2003 and, on the 
revenue side, a modest hike in indirect taxes and a 
partial adjustment to inflation of the personal income 
tax system. The deficit is forecast to reach around 
0.8% of GDP, somewhat better than planned by the 
authorities (1.1%), and to widen to 1.0% in 2005. 

Given the non-indexed nature of the tax and social 
benefit systems, the no-policy change assumption for 
2005 is made operational, in the absence of previously 

announced measures, by freezing average tax rates 
and adjusting social transfer payments by the forecast 
CPI inflation rate (with a small top-up). Government 

debt is projected to stabilise at one-third of GDP.

538. Italy Moderate recovery taking shape in 2004 The situation in 2003  
Following a strong reboundin the third quarter 
economic growth declined marginally in the last 
quarter of 20
03. This was in contrast with ongoing 
quarterly growth in the other large EU economies and 
can partly be explained by a general strike held in 
October. In 2003 as a whole growth was 0.3%, 

marginally below the euro area average. The negative 
impact from the external side more than halved the 
positive contribution from domestic demand. 
Prospects in 2004and 2005  
The recovery in 2004 is expected to be mainly driven 
by domestic demand, which should benefit from 
positive fundamentals. Private consumption is likely 

to recover from the negative reading in Q4-2003 in 
view of moderate yet positive job creation, real wage 
increases, rising housingprices and an ongoing 

recovery of stock markets. After the contraction in 
2003 triggered by the expiry of an important tax 
incentive at the end of 2002, investment is expected to 

gain strength, benefiting from low interest rates, rising 
profit margins and the improving growth outlook. The 
external side is likely to continue to act as a drag on 

economic growth, yet to a lesser extent than in 2003. 
Overall, real GDP is forecast to rise by 1.2% in 2004 
as a whole, around ½ a percentage point less than in 

the euro area average. An acceleration to around 2.1% 
is projected in 2005, again mainly sustained by firm 
domestic demand coupled with an improving yet still 

marginally negative contribution from the external 
side.Labour market, costs and prices 
Witha significant lag compared to the slowdown in 
economic activity, job creation came to a halt in the 
second half of 2003. However, thanks to the strong 

performance recorded in 2002 and the increase in the 
first half of 2003 employment was up 1% in the year 
as a whole. The rate of unemployment fell to 8.7%, 

closing the gap with the euro area average after more 
than 10 years.  
With the economic recovery taking hold in 2004, 
employment is expected to pick up gradually over the 
year. The number of full-time equivalents is forecast 

to rise by 0.3%, slightly less than the employment 
headcount due to the impact of part-timers, the legal 
basis of which was further liberalised by the ‚Biagi™ 

law at the end of 2003. Following the recent period of 
‚growth-less job creation™ ensuing from successive 
steps of labour market reform since the mid-1990s, 

the job content of growth is projected to gradually 
return to lower levels in the medium term. In 2005 
employment (full-time equivalents) is forecast to 
increase by 0.7%. The rate of unemployment is 
expected to continue its downward trend. 
HICP inflation, which averaged 2.8% in 2003, has 
eased on the year at the beginning of 2004. Falling 

import prices, a sizeable negative output gap and 
ongoing wage moderation are expected to be 
conducive to declining inflationary pressures 

throughout the year. Annual inflation is forecast to 
average somewhat above 2% in 2004 and to stay 
below that threshold in2005. The inflation 
differential vis-à-vis the euro area average is projected 
to narrow gradually. 
 Public finances 
In 2003, the general government deficit was broadly 
unchanged compared to the previous year, bolstered 
by hefty inflows from a tax amnesty, which improved 
the budgetary outturn by around 1.5% of GDP. In 

total, the one-off improvement brought about by a 
series of measures implemented in 2003 is estimated 
to have been slightly more than 2% of GDP, about 

half a percentage point above the impact recorded in 
2002. Nevertheless, the erosion of the primary surplus 
since 2001 continued. Interest expenditure was half a 

percentage point of GDP lower than the previous 
year.-4

54Chapter 3 Member States, ItalyThe government debt ratio fell to 106.2% of GDP 
from 108.0% in 2002, thanks to privatisation 
operations carried out at the end of the year in parallel 

with the transformation of 
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti 
(the savings and loans bank formerly part of the 
general government) into a joint-stock company and a 

reduction in the deposits heldwith the Bank of Italy. 
In 2004, in the absence of supplementary measures, 
the forecast general government deficit would 

increase to 3.2% of GDP. The impact of temporary 
measures is expected to halve compared to 2003. 
Withshort-term interest rates slightly lower than in 
2003 and some gains from refinancing older higher-
rate bonds with new issues, interest expenditure 

would continue to edge 
down relative to GDP. The 
primary surplus would further deteriorate, nearing the 
averages recorded at the beginning of the 1990s. 

Cyclically adjusted, the budget deficit and the primary 
surplus would both deteriorate markedly. 
The Commission forecast is aligned with the officially 
estimated budgetary impact of a number of measures 

in the Budget Law for 2004 and related legislation. 
This includes tax settlements and amnesties with a 
total impact of 0.6 percentage point of GDP. Unlike 
the official projections, sales of real estate are 

assumed to yield 0.5% of GDP (compared to 0.7% of 
GDP). Moreover, the rate of increase of compensation 
of employees is based on the observation that part of 

the increases from the new wage settlements foreseen 
for 2003 has slid to 2004. Finally, ANAS, the joint-
stock company in charge of investment and 

maintenance of the state road network, is prudentially 
assumed to remain part of the general government. 
The forecast for 2005, a deficit of 4% of GDP, is 
based on legislation currently in force. Sales of real 

assets are assumed to be considerably lower compared 
to 2004.Capital receiptsreflect theexpiration of all 
one-off revenue measures.  
The debt ratio is expected todecline marginally in 
2004 and to stabilise in 2005. Privatisation receipts 

are around 1 percentage point of GDP each year, as 
indicated in the stability programme update of 
December 2003.

559. Luxembourg Turning the corner The situation in 2003  
Economic activity in 2003 was subdued for the third 
year in a row, as Luxembourg is recovering only 
slowly from the negative impact of the global 

slowdown and the turmoil on financial markets. 
However, available data point to a recovery from the 
third quarter onwards. Industrial production was quite 

dynamic, and increased by 2.6% for the year as a 
whole. The trade balance showed a strong 
improvement in the last two quarters of the year. Real 

GDP growth is estimated to have reached 1.8% in 
2003. The labour market deteriorated, in a lagged 
response to the economic slowdown. Whereas labour 
shedding took place in some sectors, notably 
manufacturing and financial services, overall 
employment growth held up rather well at around 2%. 
This, in turn, implied that overall labour productivity 
growth remained negative for the third year in 

succession. Despite the continued growth in 
employment, the unemployment rate increased, to 
slightly above 4% at the end of the year. The broad 

unemployment figure, counting also people in specific 
employment schemes, was even higher. However, the 
increase in the unemployment rate peaked in the 

summer of 2003 and unemployment has increased 
less rapidly afterwards. While compensation growth 
decelerated somewhat, HICP inflation remained 

broadly stable at around 2.5%. First estimates indicate 
that the general government balance deteriorated 
considerably, from a surplus of 2.7% of GDP in 2002 

to a very small deficit of 0.1% of GDP in 2003. The 
deterioration was cushioned somewhat by the 
collection of back taxes and some special factors with 
a positive impact on VAT receipts.  
Prospects for 2004 and 2005  
Real GDP growth is expected to increase over the 
projection horizon, in line with the expected 
improvement in economic conditions in the euro area. 
Economic growth should gradually pick up to slightly 

above 3% in 2005, which is still well below the 
average growth rates witnessed in the 1980s and 
1990s. The modest upturn in 2004 would be primarily 
due to stronger domestic demand, with investment 
improving in response to more favourable external 

conditions. The financial sector, which accounts for 
around half of the exports from the Grand Duchy, was 
a drag on growth in the downturn but medium-term 

prospects in this sector should be more favourable. 
Consequently, net exports would be higher in 2005. 
Private consumption growth is expected to strengthen 

somewhat, in line with the development of real 
compensation per employee and a gradual 
improvement in employment. Nevertheless, the 

economic upturn would still have only a limited 
positive effect on unemployment. The unemployment 
rate is expected to increase from 3.7% on average in 

2003 to 4.7% in 2004. Unemployment would continue 
rising somewhat in the course of 2005.  
Underlying inflation is projected to decrease, in 
response to weak import prices, relatively moderate 

wage increases, and a cyclical upturn in labour 
productivity. Nevertheless,headline HICP inflation 
would fall only gradually, fr
om 2.5% in 2003 to 1.7% 
in 2005 as HICP energy inflation will rise 
considerably in2004 due to an increase in excise 

duties with effect from January 2004. The upward 
impact of the excise increase on HICP (which 
includes expenditure by non-residents) is much 

stronger than on the CPI due to the larger weight of 
fuel prices in the former.  
Public finance  
The general government balance is projected to 
deteriorate markedly in 2004 and 2005, by 2.2 

percentage points of GDP in total. The deterioration 
in the balance from 2003 onwards can be attributed to 
a combination of weak revenues, not offset by a 

sufficiently large deceleration in public expenditure.

56Chapter 3 Member States, Luxembourg
The sluggish development of revenues is driven both 
by the tax reforms implem
ented in 2001 and 2002, 
and by cyclical factors. In addition, the collection of 

substantial corporate back taxes will contribute less to 
overall revenue in 2004 and 2005 than in the two 
previous years. The deficit would increase somewhat 

in 2005, to 2.3% of GDP, asthe positive impact of the 
economic upturn on the government accounts would 
become visible only with a delay. The low gross debt 

ratio would decrease somewhat further over the 
forecast horizon, from 4.9% of GDP in 2003 to 3.8% 
of GDP in 2005.

Weathe
ring the storm 
The situation in 2003  
In the fourth quarter of 2003 real GDP growth 
(quarter-on-quarter and seasonally adjusted) turned 
positive, after 5 previous quarters of negative or 

stagnant growth. However, for the year as a whole 
real GDP declined by 0.8%, the first absolute decline 
since 1982. Against a background of low confidence 

among producers and consumers, private 
consumption growth and investment were strongly 
negative. This was due to balance sheet adjustments 

of firms and households, weak profits, and weak 
purchasing power of households. Exports did not rise 
due to the weakness in global trade, aggravated by 
substantial losses in competitiveness. Employment 
declined and the unemployment rate increased 

markedly as the labour market responded with a lag to 
the economic downturn that had started in 2001. 
HICP inflation decreased from 3.9% in 2002 to 2.2% 

in 2003, mainly accounted for by lower import prices 
and falling profit margins. 
According to provisional data for 2003, the general 
government deficit increased to 3.2% of GDP, from 

1.9% of GDP in 2003. The deficit increased despite 
substantial consolidation efforts equivalent to more 
than 1% of GDP. The weakening of central 

government revenues in response to the economic 
slowdown was the main reason for this deterioration 
in the government balance but a larger-than-foreseen 

deficit of local authorities also played a role. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005  
The Dutch economy is expected to recover from the 
strong downturn experienced in the period 2001-2003, 
but only slowly compared to previous cyclical 
upswings. Over the projection horizon, economic 

activity would remain weaker than the EU average. In 
the course of 2004, economic growth is expected to 
pick up moderately to 1% on average for the year as a 

whole, following the 0.8% decrease of real GDP last 
year. Real GDP growth would strengthen somewhat 
in 2005, to 1.6%. The upturn would be mainly driven 

by the recovery in external trade but is expected to 
remain quite weak compared to previous upswings. 
Price competitiveness would start to improve only in 
2005 as the negative impact of high price and wage 
increases in past years would fade away. The growth 

of exports would also be heldback by the sensitivity 
to the appreciation of the euro in the near term, and 
the composition of Dutch exports (tilted towards 

markets with relatively weak growth and products 
which are especially in demand in the early stages of a 
recovery). Domestic demand would remain rather 

weak over the forecast period, reflecting the modest 
development of disposable income (due to losses in 
employment growth and wage moderation), ongoing 

balance sheet adjustments in the household and 
corporate sectors, and the impact of fiscal tightening. 
Private consumption will be held back by the 

combination of a deteriorating labour market, weak 
income growth and, in 2004, a further increase in the 
savings ratio. Most of the projected modest gains in 

private consumption reflect a shift from publicly 
financed health care expenditure to private funding. 
Starting from a relatively low rate of capacity 
utilization, business investment is expected to recover 
only gradually, as firms need to restore profitability. 
The situation in the labour market is expected to 
worsen considerably in 2004 with the number of 
persons employed decreasing by around 1%. Job 
losses will be particularly pronounced in the market 

sector. The projected slight gain in employment in 
2005 partly reflects the impact of the incipient 
recovery, but is also accounted for by statistical 

changes related to reforms in sickness and disability 
insurance. Hence, the unemployment rate is projected 
to rise substantially over the projection horizon, to 

5.3% in 2004 and 6.0% in 2005. Wage inflation is

expected to decline markedlyin response to the 
deterioration in the labour market and the agreement 
among social partners to moderate wages. With 

contractual wage increases in newly concluded wage 
agreements close to zero for 2004 and 2005, total 
compensation per employee in 2005 would decelerate 

to zero as well, related to the reforms in sickness pay 
and the accompanying downward effect on the wage 
drift and upward effect on measured employment. 

Lower import prices coupledwith a deceleration in 
unit labour costs account for the forecast decrease in 
the inflation rate. HICP inflation is set to decline 
further to 1.4% in 2004 and 0.7% in 2005. The 
deceleration of inflation is cushioned somewhat by a 

recovery in profit margins. 
Public finance  
Under the assumption of no changes in fiscal policy, 
the deficit would rise to 3.5% of GDP in 2004, despite 
a package of substantial savings of around 1.2% of 

GDP (primarily consisting of expenditure reductions) 
which was included in the 2004 budget. This expected 
further worsening of the government accounts in 
2004, despite substantial fiscal tightening, illustrates 
the severity of the economic slowdown. Tax revenues 
would still suffer from weak economic activity. 

Whereas expenditure would slow down also due to 
substantial savings measures, some expenditure 
overruns have an upward effect on the deficit 

projection for 2004. As public finances respond with a 
lag to the cycle and fiscal tightening, the deficit is 
projected to decrease only somewhat in 2005, to 3.3% 

of GDP. The debt ratio is expected to rise from 54.8% 
of GDP in 2003 to around58½% of GDP in 2005. In 
view of the severity of the economic downturn, the 
cyclically adjusted balance is expected to develop 
more favourably, reaching a deficit of 0.9% of GDP 
in 2005. In response to the projected worsening of 
public finances, the government has announced 
additional savings measures, intended to achieve a 

deficit of below 3% of GDP from 2004 onwards. 
However, at the time this report was finalised no 
details on the intended measures were known, and 
hence they were not incorporated in the baseline of 
the projections.   Table 3.10

5911. Austria Economy slowly picking up 
The situation in 2003  
Activity in 2003 was sustained by the domestic 
demand components, with household consumption 
expanding moderately and investment picking up 

after the slump in 2002. Exports grew moderately as 
demand from Central and Eastern Europe slackened 
considerably. Imports, by contrast, edged up strongly 

due to the pick-up of investment, resulting in a high 
negative external contribution to growth. All in all, 
real GDP growth slowed down considerably to 0.7% 

from 1.4% in 2002. 
Prospects in 2004 and 2005 
Supported by rebounding exports on the back of the 
international upswing together with strengthening 

domestic demand, GDP growth is projected to 
accelerate to 1.8% in 2004 and further to a rate of 
2.5% in 2005.   
Household real disposable income will rise only 
moderately in 2004. Nevertheless, pent-up demand 
and a revival of consumer confidence should 
stimulate private consumption. In 2005, real 

disposable income will be boosted by a pick-up in 
labour demand, slightly declining unemployment and 
a significant income tax relief. This should give 

further momentum to household demand, although the 
decline in the saving ratio is projected to be reversed. 
Public consumption is expected to remain subdued 

throughout the forecast period, provided the 
government implements the planned reduction in 
public personnel.  Despite sufficient spare capacity, 
equipment investment expanded vigorously in 2003, 
helped by a tax incentive, and should continue to 
accelerate in 2004, reflecting the improved export 
outlook. Also, construction investment is projected to 

remain fairly strong throughout the forecast period. In 
particular, civil engineering should continue to benefit 
from public investment ininfrastructure. As for 

housing investment, an impressive upsurge after the 
downward trend occurred in 2003. With the number 
of building permits expected to go up in 2004 and 

slow down thereafter, housing investment should 
abate towards the end of the forecast period.  Exports 
are projected to rebound in2004 and gain momentum 
in 2005, but with imports accelerating at the same 
time, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth 

should remain negative in 2004 and turn neutral as of 
2005.Labour market, costs and prices 
Dependent employment expanded moderately in 
2003, as a consequence of the deceleration in overall 

output growth. Reflecting the usual time-lag, a more 
sustained pick-up in labourdemand can be expected 
only as of 2004. Unemployment is likely to rise 

further, as labour supply remains elastic. Only by 
2005, the increase in labour demand is estimated to 
outpace labour supply, translating into a, if small, 

reduction in unemployment.  
Consumer price inflation is set to remain subdued 
throughout the forecast period. The increase in energy 
taxes and excise duties on tobacco in 2004 is being 

offset by a number of price dampening factors. While 
wage moderation in the private sector is expected to 
continue, nominal increases in contractual wages are 
estimated to pick up inline with the projected cyclical 
upswing. In the public sector, moderate wage 

agreements are expected to contain the expected 
deficit increase in 2005. 
Public finances 
In 2003, the budgetary position weakened. The deficit 
widened by almost a full percentage point from 0.2% 

of GDP in 2002 to 1.1%. Expenditure overshot the 
target, reflecting a sharper-than-expected rise in 
unemployment and additional discretionary spending 

such as an increase in social transfers, an extra pay-
rise for public sector employees, additional labour 
market expenditure foreseen in the fiscal stimulus 
package, topped by deferred flood-related spending. 
Tax revenues, by contrast, developed more

Outturn
60Chapter 3 Member States, Austriafavourably than budgeted, such that the deficit turned 
out slightly below the official target. 
In January 2004, the first step of an income tax reform 
took effect. However, as tax cuts are largely offset by 

a rise in energy taxes and social contributions, the 
impact on the general government budget should be 
neutral. As regards deficit-decreasing effects, 

expected savings from the pension reform for private 
and federal employees are considerable, largely 
outpacing the increase in discretionary spending. 

However, several factors prevent a narrowing of the 
deficit. First, certain tax relief measures, originally 
planned for 2005 and worth some 0.1 percentage 
point of GDP, were brought forward. Second, the 
finance ministry revised downwards the expected 

surpluses of the sub-federal government levels by 0.2 
percentage point to 0.5% of GDP. Last but not least, 
central bank profits (in 2003 but affecting the budget 

2004) are projected to turn out considerably lower due 
to low interest rates and the depreciation of the US-
dollar. As a result, and despite the expected 
acceleration in domestic demand, the general 
government deficit isestimated to remain in the same 
order of magnitude as in 2003.
In 2005, the second step of the tax reform consisting 
of a sizeable income tax relief for both households 

and enterprises will take effect. The Austrian 
government has submitted a draft bill, whose main 
components can be expected to remain unchanged 

during the parliamentary decision making process.  
The wage and income taxrelief and tax cuts for 
enterprises are planned to amount to some 0.5% of 

GDP each. In addition, excises duties with negligible 
revenue impact (ﬁ
Bagatellsteuernﬂ) will be abolished. 
In total, the tax cuts planned for 2005 are worth some 
1.0% of GDP.   
To some extent, these revenue shortfalls will be offset 
by continued structural savings from the pension and 
administrative reforms. Despite the projected 
strengthening of domestic demand and the closing of 
the output gap, the general government deficit is 

projected to widen to almost 2% of GDP.

6112. Portugal Export-led recovery from recession 
Overall developments and prospects 
Following the cyclical downturn since 2001, which 
ended in a recession with GDP falling by an estimated 
1.3% in 2003, economic activity is projected to start 

recovering as from the first half of 2004.  
Real GDP is forecast to gain about ½% in each 
quarter during 2004. However, given the negative 
carryover from 2003, GDP growth is projected to 

attain only ¾% on annual average. In 2005, the 
assumed sustained recovery of output is projected to 
raise annual growth of GDP to about 2¼%.  
However, domestic demand is projected to lag behind 
GDP growth. Although both private consumption and 
investment are expected to gradually strengthen, both 

components are projected to grow at a moderate pace 
as private sector agents continue to redress their 
balance sheets. Government spending, for its part, 

will be constrained by continued efforts at budgetary 
consolidation.The economic recovery is seen driven by dynamic 
export growth, reflecting the strengthening of foreign 

demand (from 2¾% in 2002-2003 to about 7% in the 
period 2004-2005) and supported by improved 
price-competitiveness. As a consequence of the 

differential pattern of external versus domestic 
demand, the current account (including net capital 
transactions) is expected to be close to balance by the 

end of the forecast period.  
PricesAs a result of moderate import prices and low wage 
pressure, HICP inflation is set to decelerate further, to 
an average of just above 2% in the projection period.  
Labour market 
In the period 2002-2003, total employment declined 
by a cumulative 0.6%, while the unemployment rate 
increased from 4.1% in 2001 to 6.4% in 2003. In the 
period 2004-2005, the projected economic recovery is 

expected to generate a cumulative increase in 
employment of nearly 1%, keeping the unemployment 
rate below 7%, edging down at the end of the period.  
The cyclical downturn, together with a quasi-freeze in 
government wages for the period 2003-2004, is 
expected to have a dampening impact also on wage 

settlements in the private sector of the economy. 
Growth of total wages per employee is projected to 
decelerate from 5½% in 2002 to about 2½% on 

average in the period 2004-2005, such that the trend 
decline in price-competitiveness looks set to come to 
a halt.Households™ real disposable income is expected to 
grow by about ¾% per year. Given the assumptions 
for employment and wage behaviour, this is a 
relatively strong pace, reflecting to some extent also 

declining inflation and strong social transfers.  
Public finance 
According to the latest reporting of deficit and debt 
figures, which has been validated by Eurostat, the 
general government deficit reached an estimated value 

of 2.8% of GDP in 2003 (2.7% in 2002).  
The economic recession of 2003, leading to a large 
negative output gap, has considerably hindered the 

process of budgetary consolidation. In fact, a massive 
shortfall in tax revenue developed during 2003 
(excluding the one-off operation on the sale of tax and 

social security contributions arrears).  
On the expenditure side, by contrast, the government 
has been broadly successful in securing the planned 
restraint. Growth of total current primary expenditure 

continued to decelerate from 8.9% in 2001 to 7.8% in 
2002 and 4.1% in 2003. This basically reflects the 
sharp slowdown in government consumption due to

62Chapter 3 Member States, Portugalthe quasi-freeze of employment and nominal wages in 
2003. However, these revenue and expenditure 
developments would have led to a government deficit 

clearly above 3% of GDP in 2003. In order to prevent 
this, the Portuguese authorities relied on two one-off 
measures, together worth 2.1% of GDP, namely a 
lump-sum payment from a public enterprise to the 
government in exchange of the transfer to the latter of 
the responsibility for paying pensions, and the sale to 

a financial institution of the right to the amounts 
collected in future concerning tax and social security 
contributions arrears.  
The budget for 2004 targets a general government 
deficit of 2.8% of GDP. The forecast takes on board 
the measures included in the budget, including the 

one-off measures planned so far for 2004 worth • 1 
billion (or 0.7% of GDP).  
However, the Commission projects a general 
government deficit of 3.4% of GDP for 2004, thereby 
above the official target. This difference can basically 
be accounted for by three elements: (i) a growth 
estimate ¼ pp lower in the Commission™s forecast; (ii) 

base effects due to the significant amount of one-off 
measures adopted in 2003, mainly affecting the 
revenue side; and (iii) the partial substitution of those 

one-off measures i.e. from 2.1% of GDP to so far a 
planned value of 0.7% of GDP.  
For 2005, the forecast for the general government 
deficit is based on legislation currently in force (the 

ﬁno-policy-changeﬂ assumption). The deficit is 
projected to rise to 3.8% of GDP, reflecting the 
persistence of a sizeable negative output gap, and the 
phasing out of all one-off measures.

6313. Finland Growth picking up on a broader base The economy in 2003  
Even though economic activity held up better than 
expected, growth of real GDP moderated to 1.9% 
from 2.3% in 2002. Domestic demand provided the 

main support, while the contribution from external 
demand was subdued. Household consumption, 
fuelled by higher earnings, tax cuts on income and 

automobiles, and low interest rates, grew by 3.6%. 
Purchases of durable consumer goods were 
particularly buoyant. Public consumption moderated 

from 2002 to 0.7%. Total investment contracted for 
the second consecutive year. Although residential 
construction increased strongly, this was more than 
offset by a slump in investment in equipment and 
commercial building. Due touncertainties in the 

global economy and strong euro, demand for exports 
was weaker than anticipated. The growth contribution 
from net exports fell to 0.3 as exports and imports 

increased by 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. The 
weakening in the terms of trade continued as export 
prices fell and import prices rose slightly.   
Reflecting the subdued activity, employment declined 
by 0.3% from 2002. Nevertheless, unemployment 
remained broadly stable as labour supply contracted 
as well. Inflation (HICP) eased from an average of 

2.0% in 2002 to 1.3% in 2003, on account of lower 
prices of services and the stronger euro holding 
import prices down.  
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
Downside risks in the international economy seem to 
have abated during the latter part of 2003 and also 
survey indicators seem to point to a more positive 
outlook. Growth in 2004, while again being mainly 
driven by private consumption, should receive 

increasing support from exports and investments. 
Consequently, activity is set to expand at a steady 
pace throughout the year, yielding average growth 

over 2½% in 2004 and 2.7% in 2005.  
Job creation is expected to pick up slightly as from 
2004, allowing some modest inroads into 
unemployment. 
GDP components  
Private consumption is expectedto continue to drive 
the economy on the back of steady gains in disposable 
income following from wage increases and income 

tax cuts in 2004. In addition, higher dividend income 
of households, as dividends will be partly double 
taxed from 2005, together with low inflation will 
increase real disposable income. Public consumption 
is expected to increase modestly, given the efforts of 
the central government at expenditure control. 

Investment, seem to have bottomed out during the 
second half of 2003 and given the projected stronger 
stimulus from external demand and improving 

capacity utilisation, is projected to revive in 2004-
2005.Exports are expected to strengthen on the back of the 
improved international economic outlook and to 

further accelerate in 2005. In spite of tightening 
competition, the prospects for exports of 
telecommunication equipment appear promising. Also 

the outlook for the forest industry seems to be 
relatively favourable. However, higher consumer 
spending is expected to raise imports, squeezing the 
contribution from the exter
nal side to GDP growth. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Alcohol tax cuts of 33% on average and lower import 
prices will reduce price pressures, bringing HICP 

inflation to below ½% in 2004. In 2005, inflation may 
rise to 1.5%, as the economy expands and the effect 
of the tax cut fades away. The centralised two-year 

wage agreement provides for general wage rises of 
2.2% in 2004. Assuming the usual wage drift of about 
1 percentage point, per-capita wages are expected to 

increase by about 3½% in 2004-05. However, 
accelerating productivity growth appears likely to 
curb the rise in unit labour costs.

64Chapter 3 Member States, FinlandPublic finances 
The general government surplus turned out at 2.3% of 
GDP in 2003, broadly as anticipated. Central 
government finances were still in surplus, although 

they have been on a declining trend for three 
consecutive years, while municipalities continued to 
stay in deficit. Based on the government™s medium-

term spending guidelines of Spring 2004 and the 
budget for 2004, the general government surplus is 
estimated to stay around 2% of GDP during the 

forecast period. Central government finances are seen 
to be in deficit in 2004-05. This results from rising 
expenditures and modestly growing overall revenue 
intake. Moreover, the financial position of local 
governments appears to stay in deficit due to weak 

growth in tax receipts and higher consumption 
expenditures. Overall, the general government surplus 
will be supported by the social security funds. 
In 2003, general government gross debt rose by 2.7 
percentage points to 45.3% of GDP due mainly to a 
technical change in the classification of central 

government debt as the repo portfolio was removed 
from the State Treasury™s balance sheet. The debt 
ratio is anticipated to ease to about 44.3% of GDP by 

the end of the forecast period.

6514. Sweden Steady recovery after a mild trough The situation in 2003  
Swedish economic growth decelerated mildly in 2003, 
with GDP growth of 1.6%, compared with 2.1% in 
2002. Exports improved considerably after two years 

of poor growth. At the same time, imports rose faster 
but overall, net exports contributed positively to 
growth. On the domestic side, economic activity was 

mixed. Private consumption growth was relatively 
strong and grew faster than in 2002, despite negative 
employment growth. Relatively high consumer 

confidence, buoyed by a rise in share prices and in 
house prices is likely to have contributed to this. By 
contrast, investment developed very poorly and fell 
for the third year in a row. Public consumption 
growth eased considerably, reflecting some budgetary 

constraints. Inflation has come down markedly in 
recent months and as inflationary pressures should 
remain subdued, the Riksbank cut the repo-rate again 

in early 2004. 
Prospects in 2004and 2005  
Recent indicators are positive, with both consumers 
and business expectations at relatively high levels. 
The consumer confidence indicator, and in particular 

consumers' expectations regarding their own 
economic situation, continued to give a positive 
picture in March, though slightly down from 

February. Business confidence indicators too are 
encouraging. The industrial confidence indicator has 
been rising since last autumn and stood above its 

long-term average in March. The purchasing 
manage
rs index too has risen in recent months and 
was well above the 50-mark in February. These 
prospects are expected to result in a continuation of 

the recovery in 2004. Domestic demand growth 
should become stronger and external demand growth 
should pick up further during 2004, resulting in 

stronger exports and a larger positive contribution 
from net exports. In 2005, economic growth is 
expected to continue to strengthen, as the recovery 

should be more firmly in place. Overall, GDP is 
expected to grow by 2.3% in 2004 and 2.6% in 2005. 
Disposable income growth is expected to be stronger 
in 2004 compared with last year, providing for 
continued steady growth in private consumption. 
Consumer confidence has improved significantly 

recently. Financial wealth has partially recovered 
from the long slump in the stock markets, with the 
recent rise in equity prices. House prices have 

continued to rise steadily, contributing to a relatively 
strong wealth position of households. In 2005, a 
resumption of employment growth is expected to 

contribute to household disposable income. Moreover, 
the saving rate of households remained very high at 
11% in 2003, though it was down compared with the 

previous year. An additional modest reduction of the 
saving rate is expected this year and next. All in all, 
this should result in stable consumption growth in the 

years to 2005. Public consumption is expected to 
continue to be relatively weak over the forecast 
period, in part due to budgetary constraints at the 

local and central level. The latest investment survey in 
industry point to a strongexpansion in 2004 and the 
improved outlook for external demand, including for 
the ICT sector, suggest higher investment. A rise in 
investment is foreseen for 2004 and further in 2005, 
as economic activity gathers momentum and the 
productive capacity needs to be expanded, following a 
period of falling investment. In 2004 and 2005, a 

further recovery in exports is expected, as noted 
above. Imports too should continue to rise, in 
particular in 2005, as final demand recovers 

gradually, resulting in a positive contribution from net 
exports in 2004 and slightly so also in 2005. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment growth has been negative since the latter 
half of 2003. During the same period the 

unemployment  rate  has  risen,  in  part as  a  result of

The gradual increase in economic activity foreseen 
from 2004 onwards is expected to result in an 

improvement in the labour market only in 2005. 
Inflation has come down considerably since the 
electricity and energy price hike last year and also 
reflecting relatively weak economic activity in 2003. 

Inflationary pressures should be very subdued this 
year and as demand and growth revives further in 
2005, inflation is expected togradually rise towards 

2% at the end of 2005. With gradually stronger 
growth over this period, interest rates may start to rise 
next year. New wage agreements for most of the 
labour market are expected to be reached this spring 
and are likely to result in moderate wage increases. 

This can partly be attributedto the deterioration in the 
labour market since last year, expected to continue 
into this year and only revert in 2005.  
Public finances  
In 2004, the surplus in public finances is expected to 
remain relatively low. Despite stronger economic 
growth being projected this year, the continued poor 

developments in the labour market, with a rise in the 
unemployment rate, weigh on the public finances. In 
2004, the expenditure ceiling on central government, 

announced in the Budget Bill for 2004, helps to 
contain expenditure. In 2005, a higher surplus in the 
public finances is projected on current policies, due to 

stronger economic activity and an expected 
improvement in the labour market. General 
government debt, which mainly lies in central 
government, is projected to rise as central government 
is expected to remain in deficit over the forecast 

period. The rise is however slower than nominal GDP 
over the forecast period, resulting in a fall in the debt 
ratio to a bit above 50% of GDP in 2005.

6715. United Kingdom 
Above-trend growth, as investment and net exports revive 
The situation in 2003  
The UK economy weathered the recent global slow-
down relatively well, with growth slightly below 
trend at 2.2%. Strong household consumption and 

general government spending continued to drive 
growth, offset by weakness in net exports. 
Though weaker overall than 2002, private 
consumption expenditure remained a significant 

driver of growth, particularlyin the second half of the 
year. Fixed investment picked up strongly over the 
course of 2003, while general government 
consumption also remained firm. The pickup in the 
global economy meant that the drag on growth from 

net exports slowed, with firm export growth notable 
in Q4. However, weakness in the sterling effective 
exchange rate during the first half of the year was 

largely reversed by the subsequent appreciation, thus 
removing a potential stimulus to growth in export 
volumes. 
Growth was strongest in the service and construction 
sectors, where continued strength in housing 
construction caused output to grow by 5%. 
Manufacturing output grew for 4 consecutive quarters 

for the first time since 2000.   
The labour market has remained strong, with 
unemployment falling to around 5%. Despite this, 
inflationary pressures have remained subdued. In 

December 2003, the Government announced that the 
Bank of England would switch to a symmetric 
inflation target based on the harmonised index of 
consumer prices, known in the UK as CPI. CPI 
remained comfortably below the new 2% target 

throughout 2003, within the permitted one-
percentage-point symmetrical margin.    
Autumn 2003 also saw extensive revisions to 
historical national accounts data by the Office for 

National Statistics following methodological 
improvements. The new numbers indicate that UK 
GDP growth was more robust between 1998 and 

2000, and more balanced than previously thought, 
with less household and general government 
consumption and better corporate investment and 
exports.Prospects in 2004 and 2005 
Growth is forecast to be slightly above trend in both 
2004 and 2005, reaching around 3% in 2004, before 

moderating to 2.8% in 2005. The current estimated 
negative output gap, of around ½% of GDP, should 
therefore close over the forecast horizon. Domestic 

demand is expected to strengthen in 2004, with 
continued strength in household consumption, and a 
significant pick-up in corporate investment. As the 

global outlook improves, exports should also 
improve. 
Strong household consumption growth is expected to 
moderate over the forecast period from the robust 
growth reported in the second half of 2003, as house 
price growth slows and interest rate rises begin to 
bite. In line with the government™s plans, growth of 

government consumption will continue to support 
growth throughout the forecast period.  
Fixed investment is expected to recover strongly 
following a prolonged period of weakness, due to 
improvements in business expectations. Construction 
growth is forecast to moderate, more than offset by 

markedly stronger investment in equipment.  
Robust growth of investment in equipment should 
contribute to higher goods imports.  However, despite 
strong growth in exports throughout the forecast 

period as the global outlook improves, net exports 
will continue to act as a drag on GDP growth in 2004.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
Unemployment is expected to remain low and stable 
at around 5%, close to its NAIRU level, throughout

68Chapter 3 Member States, United Kingdomthe forecast period.  Employment should continue to 
grow, though more moderately than in recent years. In 
the face of strengthening demand, wage growth is 

expected to rise, particularly as bonus payments 
become more widespread. However, with productivity 
growth expected to improve from the low rate 

observed in 2003, unit labour cost rises should be 
moderate over the forecast period.  
Both consumer and producer output price indices 
suggest inflationary pressures remain subdued. At 

1.3% in December, CPI inflation is low, but is 
expected to rise toward its 2% target over the forecast 
period as the output gap closes. In taking a forward-
looking approach to monetary policy, the Bank of 
England has raised interest rates twice, by 25 basis 

points in both November 2003 and February 2004. 
Public finances 
The public finances have deteriorated markedly since 
2002. In 2003, the general government finances 
recorded a deficit of 3.2% of GDP, significantly 
higher than the UK authorities™ forecasts in April 
2003, in large part due to a downgrading of expected 

revenue linked to composition effects of GDP growth 
and to higher discretionary expenditure related to the 
Iraq war. The deficit is expected to narrow over the 

forecast period as discretionary expenditure growth is 
forecast to slow relative to 2003 - it is assumed that 
expenditure will turn out broadly as projected by the 

authorities, in nominal terms. Revenues, notably 
income and corporation tax, are expected to increase 
as a consequence of stronger GDP growth, but at a 
lower pace than in the Budget forecast. The projected 
deficits decline to around 2.8% of GDP in 2004, 
declining further to 2.6% in 2005.  The ratio of gross 
debt to GDP, though increasing slightly, is expected 
to be close to 40% by the end of 2005.

69Chapter 4 Acceding countries Acceding countries More investment ahead The perspective of accession generated a positive 
growth stimulus in 2003 
Private consumption, increasing at about 4½ % in the 
acceding countries as a whole was supporting growth 
with the notable exception of Slovakia.  In particular, 
private consumption was strong in the Baltic States, 

Hungary and the Czech Republic.  The purchasing 
power of households increased thanks to relatively 
low inflation which was at the level of the euro area in 

the acceding countries as a whole (2.1 %), while wage 
growth remained strong. Household spending was 
further underpinned by increased borrowing and a 
certain amount of consumer expenditure was brought 
forward in expectation of price rises in 2004. 
By contrast, investment activity was weak (except in 
the Baltic States), reflecting not only the global 
situation, but also the stalling reform process in the 
acceding countries.  Surprisingly, exports did very 

well, in spite of the lack of demand in the EU, the 
main trading partner of the new Member States.  This 
can mainly be explained by an improved export 

basket as acceding countries reap the benefits from 
the foreign direct investment of the past. Slovakia is a 
clear example of this.  In Poland, however, the 

depreciation of the zloty, contributed significantly to 
the good export performance. 
Investment set to become a driver of growth 
After the recent weak performance, total investment 
growth is expected to accelerate from 1.9 % last year 

to 5¾ % and 7¼ % in 2004 and 2005, respectively.  
Favourable monetary conditions, the recovery in the 
EU and the need to improve infrastructure are the 
factors which should stimulate investment.  In general 

economic activity will be supported by the availability 
of EU funds. Including pre-accession aid which is 
phased out, about EUR 31 billion (about 7% of GDP 

of the acceding countries) is available in payment 
appropriations in the period 2004-2006 for the 10 new 
Member States. A contribution to the EU budget of 

about EUR 13.5 billion (4 % of GDP) is expected 
from the acceding countries in the same period, 
leaving the new Member States as net beneficiaries 
overall.  
Private consumption is forecast to remain robust, 
though weakening somewhat as inflation picks up 
eroding real disposable income.  Exports are expected 
to benefit from the recovery in the EU, but the net 
external contribution to growth is likely to become 

negative as the strength of domestic demand in the 
acceding countries fuels imports.   
The new Member States with the lowest per capita 
GDP are expected to grow the fastest, accelerating the 

process of catching up with the standard of living in 
the EU. Benefiting from macroeconomic stability, the 
Baltic States are expected to post growth rates above 

5 % in 2004-2005. The strongest acceleration of 
growth is forecast in Poland (from 1½ % in 2002 to 
almost 5 % in 2005) on the back of an expansionary 

fiscal policy.  Among the high-income acceding 
countries, Cyprus is also expected to grow relatively 
strongly, but the prospects of re-unification entails 
both upside and downside risks. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2003, employment continued to decline, 
particularly in Poland.As a consequence, the 

unemployment rate remainedhigh at 14.3 % on 
average.  In 2004-2005, employment is expected to 
increase moderately as the economy picks up and new 

activities develop, compensating for the job losses in 
the restructuring process.  The unemployment rate 
will decline only slowly to13.8 % in 2005, in the 

acceding countries as a whole. In the wake of the 
significant wage increases in some new Member 
States (Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia) 

in 2003, putting upward pressure on unit labour costs, 
compensation per employee is expected to increase 
more moderately this year and next.

72Chapter 4 Acceding CountriesAt 2.1% on average, inflation was particularly low in 
2003 in the new Member States (except in Hungary, 
Slovakia and Slovenia). An acceleration is, however, 

expected in 2004 to 3.8 % on average in the acceding 
countries as a result of an increase in excise taxes and 
VAT because levels have to be harmonised with the 

EU. Inflationary pressures should ease in 2005. High government deficits, but generally declining 
According to their first notification to the European 
Commission under the Excessive Deficit Procedure, 
most government balances in the acceding countries 
in 2003 turned out better than expected in the 
Commission™s autumn forecasts. Only in the Czech 

Republic was the deficit significantly revised upwards 
because of the inclusion of some state guarantees. On 
average, the general government deficit in the 
acceding countries is estimated to be 5.7% of GDP in 
2003, ranging from a surplus in Estonia to a deficit of 
12.9 % of GDP in the Czech Republic. Five other 

countries have deficits in excess of 3% of GDP: 
Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia. 
In view of the importance of budgetary consolidation 
for the adoption of the euro, efforts are being stepped 

up and government balances are expected to improve 
in most new Member States in 2004, with the notable 
exception of Poland, where 
a major fiscal reform 
package (the Hausner plan) will start to have an effect 
only in 2005.  Budgetary balances are also worsening 
in the Baltic Sates despite strong growth because of 
accession-related expenditures.

731. Cyprus Continued moderate growth and fiscal slippage in 2003, renewed fiscal 
consolidation efforts to start in 2004 
The situation in 2003  
In 2003 the decline in tourist arrivals continued, as a 
result of the Iraq war, SARS, and low EU growth. 
GDP growth in 2003 is therefore estimated at a 

modest 2%, similar to 2002. From July onward a 
gradual restrained recovery seems to be on the way, 
with Q3 and Q4 growth at 2-2.5%. The expansion 

continued to be domestic-demand led, notably in 
construction investment and government 
consumption, as fiscal policy remained expansionary 

and the government deficit widened. Consumption 
growth was modest at 1.5% in 2003, following real 
wage growth, although disposable income increased 
due to tax reform and continuing full-employment 
conditions, and consumer confidence picked up 

somewhat. Investment declined by nearly 3.0%, 
although when corrected for ships/aircraft purchases 
in 2002, growth would still be above 4%, while 

construction investment remained buoyant. Demand 
was supported by lower interest rates after the Central 
Bank of Cyprus (CBC) lowered rates by 50 points to 

4.5% in April 2003 which, together with somewhat 
higher inflation rates, reduced real interest rates. 
Following a 10% decline in 2002, tourist arrivals 
dropped a further 5% in2003 (although stabilising 

from the UK, Cyprus™ largest market). Total export 
growth was marginal while imports declined. Overall, 
and with slightly improved terms of trade, the current 

account deficit reached 4.4% of GDP, below the 2002 
level but still relatively high and therefore remaining 
a potential concern.Prospects in 2004and 2005  
After a difficult international environment in 2001-
2003, contributing to low growth and increasing 
economic imbalances in Cyprus, the outlook is 

cautiously positive. Tourist arrivals should revive 
gradually in 2004-5, in line with historical experience 
and reflecting global recovery and a positive spill-

over of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.For 
2004, GDP growth is projected to climb to 3.4%, 
strengthening further in 2005to 4.1%, as external 
demand picks up. Investmentgrowth should recover, 
encouraged by EU accession, liberalisation in 

financial and utilities markets, and infrastructure 
projects (airports in Larnaca and Paphos and a port in 
Larnaca), while consumption growth strengthens in 

line with real wage development. Domestic private 
demand therefore remains a driving force, although 
fiscal consolidation is expected to put downward 

pressure on total domestic demand. Higher domestic 
demand will stimulate import growth but the revival 
in tourism exports and fiscal consolidation should 

bring a lower current account deficit. Overall the 
forecast projects a decrease in the current account 
deficit in 2004 and 2005 to around 3.6% of GDP.    
It must be noted that these projections are subject to 
unusual uncertainty: negotiations for a settlement of 
the Cyprus problem restarted in early 2004. In the 
event of reunification the island™s economic situation 

would fundamentally change.  
Labour market, costs and prices  
Withrelatively low growth continuing in 2003, 
unemployment rose slightlyto 4.4%, up from 3.9% in 

2002. The relatively flexible labour market, linked to 
the service economy, has held up well and continued 
to operate at near full-employment levels. For this 

year and next unemployment is expected to inch 
lower again as GDP growth picks up. 
The peg to the euro with a closely managed monetary 
policy and relatively low wage pressures have been 
among the main factors keeping inflation in check. 
Prices in 2002 and 2003 were mainly pushed by 

higher VAT taxation related to EU accession. 
Inflation reached 2.8% in 2002 and climbed to 4% for 
2003 (lower than originally expected) but is foreseen

74Chapter 4 Acceding Countries, Cyprus to drop back to about 2% for 2004 and 2005, 
following similar VAT-hikes and inflation paths in 
the past; it stood at 1.4% y-o-y in February 2004. In 

November 2003, following publication of an 
academic paper containing a citizen™s opinion survey, 
newspaper articles discussing devaluation of the 

pound appeared in the Cypruspress. However, such 
speculation was strongly rejected by the CBC while 
the pound remained stable vis-à-vis the euro 

throughout. Real wage increases in 2002 exceeded 
productivity growth but are estimated to have 
remained below the latter for 2003 (1% and 1.5% 
respectively). For 2004-2005 real wage increases are 
expected to remain at or below productivity growth. 
Public finance 
After slipping in 2002, fiscal consolidation went 
further awry in 2003 and the consolidation 
programme was effectively abandoned in the course 
of the year. Increased spending through higher 
defence outlays and expansionary measures to offset 
subdued external demand plus revenue shortfalls 
linked to low growth and tax avoidance led to a 

government deficit of 6.3% of GDP, even higher than 
the 5.2% Autumn forecast. The new fiscal 
consolidation plan adopted in September 2003 no 

longer targets a budget balance over the medium term 
(and was in the meantime revised upward). Even then, 
considerable corrective measures are required. 

Positively, investment will not be cut back. The 
quality of public finances should improve due to 
public finance reform to be finished end-2004. 
Measures will then be in place to improve revenues 
(e.g. increasing government service fees, reinforcing 

of tax compliance) and expenditures (reduction of 
military outlays, agricultural subsidies, containment 
of public sector wages). The forecast is for a gradually 

declining -but still relatively high- deficit of 4.6% of 
GDP for 2004 and 4.1% of GDP by 2005, somewhat 
above the government targets.

752. Czech Republic 
Worrying dynamics of public debt 
The economy in 2003 
In 2003, real GDP growth was strong reaching 
2.9%, as compared to 2.2% in the Commission™s 
autumn 2003 forecast. The main driving force of 

economic growth was private consumption (mainly 
by households) and exports. Private consumption 
grew by 5.4%, which was unexpected given the 

rising unemployment rate. Exports grew by 6.7% 
which was also above expectations as the external 
environment remained difficult. Government 

consumption stagnated in 2003 (0.0%). 
Buoyant household consumption was mainly a 
result of the combination of an increase in real 
disposable income and of low nominal interest rates 
that enabled an expansion of consumer credit. The 

growth rate of gross fixed capital formation was 
3.7%. In total, the contribution of final domestic 
demand to GDP growth was 4.3 percentage points. 

Although exports expressed in current koruna 
prices went up by 6.7% in 2003, imports increased 
by 7.6% and net exports made a negative 

contribution to GDP growth (Œ1.6 percentage 
points). 
Growth prospects in 2004 and 2005 
Growth prospects for 2004 and 2005 largely depend 
on the degree of economic recovery in the EU, in 
particular in Germany. They will also be influenced 

by the recently adoptedfiscal consolidation 
package. GDP growth for 2004 is predicted to be 
the same as in 2003 (2.9%) and accelerate in 2005 
(3.4%). Due to increases in indirect taxes, 
household consumption is projected to decelerate in 
2004 and to increase somewhat again in 2005, in 
line with the assumed economic recovery. Due to 

cuts in government expenditures, government 
consumption will stagnate in 2004 and in 2005. 
Growth of gross fixed capital formation is expected 

to slightly accelerate to 3.8% in 2004 and 4.5% in 
2005. The negative growth contribution of net 
exports is projected to weaken. 
InflationIn 2003, the Czech Republic faced a new 
phenomenon: falling prices. Average HICP 
inflation was -0.1%. Since April 2002, the 
monetary authorities have been undershooting the 
inflation target. In 2004, inflation is forecast to 

increase to 2.8% on average, mainly as a 
consequence of higher indirect taxes. The annual 
HICP inflation is expected to remain 2.8% in 2005, 

assuming that second-round effects of indirect tax 
increases are kept under control. 
Labour market  
Restructuring in the industrial sector led to a 
continued increase in the unemployment rate during 
2003 and the average unemployment rate reached 

7.8%. In addition to the ongoing restructuring 
process, unemployment is expected to be affected 
by the public finance reform, according to which 

employment in the public sector should be 
diminished by 2% annually over the period 2004-
2006. Structural impediments in the Czech labour 

market will cause that economic resurgence will not 
be accompanied by revival in the labour market. 
The unemployment rate is expected to reach 8.2% 
both in 2004 an
d in 2005. 
Current account 
In 2003, the trade balance deficit developed 
positively. Despite high import growth on the back 
of strong private demand and investment, the 

overall deficit was smaller than expected (-2.9% of 
GDP). This improvement was partly due to a 
favourable development of the terms of trade. The 

smaller trade balance deficit was offset by the 
diminishing surplus in the balance of services. The 
deficit in the income balance further increased due 

to higher reinvested and repatriated profits. In total, 
the current account deficit reached 6.5% of GDP.

76Chapter 4 Acceding Countries, Czech Republic slightly improve, mainly has a result of improved 
non-price competitiveness of domestic producers. 
The surplus in the balance of services as a 

percentage of GDP is also expected to slightly 
increase, reaching 1.1% of GDP in 2005. Foreign 
investors™ profits are expected to the repatriated, 

which is partially linked to the effort of EU-based 
companies to improve theirbalance sheets. This is 
expected to worsen the income balance. As a result, 

the current account deficit should remain around 
6¾% of GDP in 2004 and 2005. 
Public finances 
According to ESA95 data communicated by the 
Czech authorities, the general government deficit in 
2003 reached 12.9% of GDP. Almost half of this 
deficit is due to one single imputed state guarantee 
(about 6.3% of GDP). Without this imputed 

guarantee the deficit would be about 6.6% of GDP, 
including other capital transfers (to the Czech 
Consolidation Agency and to the Railways Route 

Administration). This deficit would be better than 
the 8.0% of GDP projected in the Commission™s 
Autumn forecast. Overall, the execution of the state 
budget was better than expected in 2003. Due to the 

high 2003 general government deficit, gross public 
debt jumped from 28.9% of GDP in 2002 to 37.6% 
of GDP in 2003. 
In 2004 and in 2005, the general government deficit 
is projected to improve and to reach 5.9% of GDP 
and 5.1% of GDP, respectively. Diminishing 

deficits will mainly be a consequence of fiscal 
consolidation which focuses on the expenditure 
side. The envisaged expenditure savings should 
represent more than two thirds of total 
consolidation the remaining consolidation should 

be reached by increased revenues. However, there 
are fiscal risks linked to the remaining state 
guarantees which are currently estimated at about 

7% of GDP. Gross public debt is expected to 
increase from 40.6% of GDP in 2004 to 42.4% of 
GDP in 2005.   Table 4.2

773. Estonia External account deficit set to narrow, with growth becoming more 
export-driven.The situation in 2003 
GDP growth in 2003 decreased to a still respectable 
4.8%. In contrast to 2002, growth was based upon a 
more balanced composition: investment growth of 
well above 10% and private consumption Œ supported 
by employment growth, rising real wages and 
increased bank lending Œ were the most important 

contributors. Export growth also picked up again, at a 
modest rate. However, with imports still growing far 
more rapidly than exports, the net foreign contribution 
remained negative. This resulted in a further widening 
of the current account deficit to 13.7% of GDP in 
2003. CPI inflation came down to an annual average 
of only 1.3%, owing to exchange rate movements and 
other temporary factors. Labour market conditions 

continued to improve and the unemployment rate 
declined to 9.3% of the labour force in the 4
thquarter, 
while employment increased by 1 % for the year as a 

whole. The general government surplus in 2003 
increased further to 2.6% of GDP. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005  
Real GDP is expected to grow at around 5-6 % over 
2004-05. Whereas private consumption and 
investment will remain the most important sources of 
growth also in 2004 and 2005, the overall outlook is 

for more balanced growth, given slowly decreasing 
domestic demand and a steady improvement in the 
external environment. Consequently, the current 

account deficit is forecast to narrow to around 9 % of 
GDP by 2005. Inflation is not expected to remain at 
its current low level, but to accelerate to around 3%. 
Following the positive outturn in 2002/2003, the 
general government budget is forecast to remain 
balanced or in small surplus over the forecasting 

period. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The strong growth performance over recent years has 
translated into sizeable employment gains, and 

unemployment came down to below 10% of the 
labour force at the end of 2003. Early figures for 2004 
indicate a continuation of this positive trend. Even 

more encouraging, unemployment decreased 
significantly in North-eastern Estonia, where 
unemployment is twice as high as in the rest of the 
country. Unemployment is forecast to continue 
declining in the medium term, towards a rate around 

9.5%, but a considerable skills mismatch will prevent 
a faster improvement in labour market conditions. 
Real wages grew by 8.3% in 2003, owing not least to 

rapid disinflation. Nonetheless, Estonia™s competitive 
position is expected to remain strong over the forecast 
period, since it is underpinned by robust productivity 

growth and a flexible labour market. 
Inflationary pressure receded more than expected, to 
an annual average of just 1.3% in 2003, thanks largely 
to the strength of the euro to which the Kroon is 
pegged. Thus, inflation in Estonia at present is lower 

than in the euro-area. However, this strong drop in 
inflation was mainly due to temporary factors, and the 
trend is expected to reverse in 2004, with a number of 
tax measures and administered price hikes exerting 
upward pressure on prices. Given on the other hand 
the weakening impact of
 the US dollar on kroon 
prices for imported oil and consumer electronics 
goods, the inflation forecast for 2004 and 2005 

remains below 3%.  
Balance of payments 
The global economic slowdown, and in particular its 
effects on the telecommunication sector continued to 
weaken Estonia's trade balance. In addition, the 
exceptionally cold winter and the freezing of the bay 
of Tallinn in 2002/2003 had a negative effect on 
services exports. The delayed recovery in the EU 
added  to  the  drag  on  demand  for  Estonian  goods  

and  services,  which  grew  by  only  5.1% in  2003.  
At  the same time, imports increased by 8.1%. As a   
consequence,   in   2003   the current   account deficit 

widened  to  an  estimated  13.7% of GDP.   As the re-

78Chapter 4 Acceding Countries, Estoniacovery in the EU gathers momentum, export growth 
in Estonia is forecast to gradually accelerate over 
2004 and 2005, while import growth is forecast to 

temporarily slow down in 2004, partly due to base 
effects. As the external environment improves 
further, and investment recovers, following a 

temporary slowdown in 2004, demand for imports 
both for consumer goods and for intermediate 
inputs will pick up again in 2005. The capital 

account is expected to remain in surplus, which 
along with sizeable FDI and portfolio inflows will 
help to better balance the external account of 
Estonia. On the whole, the current account is 
forecast to slowly come down to a deficit around 

9% of GDP by 2005.  
Public finance 
The general government posted a surprise surplus 
of2.6% of GDP in 2003. This was achieved mainly 
through improved tax collection, despite additional 
election-induced spending in 2003.  Certain local 
governments (notably Tallinn) reported 
considerable deficits.  Tax cuts that are being 

implemented from 2004, along with increased 
social benefits, and EU accession-related 
expenditure are expected to weaken somewhat the 

budgetary position in 2004 and 2005. On the other 
hand, projected higher cyclical tax revenues, and 
strict expenditure control are expected to offset part 

of the revenue losses from the tax cut. On the 
whole, for 2004 a reduced surplus of around 0.7% 
of GDP is projected, whereas for 2005 a balanced 
budget is expected.

794. Hungary Strengthening of economic growth, 
challenges ahead for fiscal consolidation The situation in 2003  
In 2003 real GDP growth eased somewhat to 2.9% 
owing to sluggish investment activity and a 
negative contribution from net exports. The fiscal 

deficit significantly exceeded the authorities' target 
for the second year running, reaching 5.9% of GDP 
as a result of expenditure slippages (higher than 

expected current expenditures, including social 
benefits, and interest payments) and weaker tax 
revenues (especially from personal income and 

corporate taxes). The external position deteriorated 
significantly with the current account deficit 
widening to 5.7% of GDP. The successful 
disinflation process of the previous years came to a 
halt in mid-2003, and inflation picked up in the last 

months of the year reaching an annual average of 
4.7%. 
Prospects in 2004 and 2005 
GDP growth, which had accelerated in the second 
half of 2003, is forecast to remain solid reaching 

3.2% in 2004 and 3.4% in 2005. Strong investment 
growth and a recovery in external demandŠand 
hence a positive contribution of net exportsŠare 

expected to underpin GDP growth in the near term. 
Private consumption, which had bolstered GDP 
growth in recent years, will slow down 

considerably in 2004-05, mainly due to a 
moderation in wage growth. Construction 
investment is expected to decline in the latter part 

of the forecast period on account of changes in the 
subsidised housing loan system, although that trend 
will be offset by buoyant business investment 
activity, especially in the manufacturing sector. As 
the government strives to control the public sector 
deficit, public infrastructure investment will decline 

in 2004. However, spending pressure is likely to 
emerge, as commitments related to co-financing of 
EU- financed investments increase, particularly in 

2005.Labour market, costs and prices 
A significant deceleration in wage growth is 
forecast following three years of hefty wage 
increases, reaching 50% in some cases. However, 
while public wages will remain broadly unchanged 
in real terms, private sector wages are expected to 

rise somewhat faster than the 7-8% nominal wage 
growth that was agreed in recent wage negotiations.  
The unemployment rate is forecast to decline from 
5.8% of the labour force in 2003 to 5.6% in 2005. 

Moderate employment growth of around ½% is 
likely to be offset by a growing civilian labour 
force.Due to tax hikes, notablyan increase in VAT and 
excises taxes, a further acceleration of inflation to 
6.9% can be expected in 2004. Assuming no 
second-round effects, and no significant weakening 

of the currency from the present level, inflationary 
pressures are likely to dissipate and inflation is 
expected to decline to 4.6% in 2005.  
Balance of payment developments 
An improvement in the trade balance, slowing 
domestic demand growth, due to expected fiscal 
tightening and decelerating private consumption 
growth, will contribute toa gradual narrowing of 
the current account deficit from 5.4 % of GDP in 
2004 to 5.1% in 2005
1.Public finances 
In addition to the recently revised budget deficit 
target for 2004 (from 3.8% to 4.6% of GDP), the 
government announced a series of measures for 
1The first figures on the new method of calculating the current 
account deficit were published end-March 2004. Therefore, the 
Commission™s forecast is still based on the old method (i.e. 
excluding reinvested earnings). With the new method, the deficit 
can be expected to be about 2 percentage points higher as a 
proportion of GDP. 02468101214169899000102030405

Hungary - GDP growth and inflation
80Chapter 4 Acceding Countries, Hungary expenditure cuts equivalent to around 1% of GDP. 
These measures are aiming at rationalising resource 
management, and the postponement of several large 
public investments projects. A real wage freeze in the 
public sector, and the ongoing reduction of the 
number of public employees should also contribute to 

the reduction of expenditures. Measures, such as the 
recent freezing of subsidized pharmaceutical 
products™ prices should prevent the overspending on 

drug subsidies, as seen in 2003. The substantial 
tightening of housing subsidies will only have 
substantial effect in 2005.Due to the tax reform of last year, higher revenue 
from indirect taxes (VAT and excise taxes) can be 
expected. Direct tax™ rates (both personal income tax 

and corporate taxes) were lowered, while numerous 
tax allowances and credits were eliminated. This 
should contribute to a decline in the revenue of 

corporate taxes, while revenues from the personal 
income tax are expected to remain broadly stable.  
These measures should provide a basis for a 
significant narrowing of the budget deficit. However, 
the revenue shortfall and the overspending of 2003 

still indicate some risks to achieve the target for 2004. 
The risks of higher-than-envisaged housing subsidies, 
tax exemptions and interest payments remain. The 

additional revenues from an improvement in tax 
collection efficiency might also not materialize to the 
envisaged extent, as such measures are effective 

rather in the long term.Therefore the general 
government deficit forecast for 2004 is 4.9% of GDP. 
In 2005, expenditure related to co-financing of EU-
related investment projects, and the realisation of 
other postponed investment project might limit the 
scope for a deficit reduction. Therefore a narrowing of 

the deficit to 4.3% of GDP is forecast.  
The gross debt ratio is estimated to have reached 59% 
of GDP in 2003 and is expected to decline to 58% by 
the end of 2005.

815. Latvia Continued robust growth, widening current account deficit 
The situation in 2003  
Despite a weak external environment, GDP growth 
continued strongly at 6.1% in 2002 and accelerated 
further to 7.4% in the first three quarters of 2003 year-

on-year. For 2003 as a whole, GDP growth is likely to 
have reached 7.5%. Private consumption and gross 
fixed capital formation were particularly buoyant and 

became driving factors for growth. 
Private consumption is estimated to have grown by 
about 8% in 2003, supported by employment growth, 
rising real wages and increased bank lending. Gross 
fixed capital formation remained buoyant, growing by 
some 9.5%, as a result of favourable credit conditions 

and reinforced macroeconomic stability. Exports 
growth was strong at 12.7%; however, imports grew 
faster and this caused a widening of the current 

account deficit. The current account balance 
weakened by 30% and the deficit increased from 
7.6% to 9.1% of GDP. During 2003, inflation 

accelerated to 2.9% from 2% in 2002. This was partly 
due to higher regulated prices on gas, heating and 
rent. Imports also become more expensive. While 

employment growth was sluggish, the unemployment 
rate went down to 10.5%. The general government 
deficit in 2003 decreased to 1.8% of GDP, largely 

owing to better-than-expected tax revenues. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
Growth prospects for 2004 and 2005 are strong, with 
an expected growth rate of 6.2% each year. In both 
years final domestic demand is expected to be driving 

growth, primarily led by increases in private 
consumption on the back of sustained increases in real 
disposable income and better access to credit. In 2004 

and 2005, private consumption is expected to 
continue to show healthy growth at a slightly lower 
pace of 7.1-6.5% as 2003 increase of disposable 

income is going to wear out. Overall investment 
growth is lik
ely to remain high at 10% in 2004 and 
2005. Housing investment is projected to increase 
over the entire forecast period. The large depletion of 
stocks in 2002 should come to an end, but no 

significant contribution to GDP growth from stocks is 
expected for the forecast period. 
External demand will continue to be important for 
growth. The recovery of the EU economy and a 

further assumed depreciation of the lat against the 
euro will keep export growth strong. Import growth is 
expected to remain robust, albeit at a slower pace than 

exports growth, allowing for 
a narrowing of the trade 
balance. Thus, for 2005 the contribution from net 
exports will have recovered toŒ1.9 percentage points 

from Œ2.3 percentage points in 2003. Accordingly, 
real GDP is expected to grow at around 6.2% or close 
to potential in both forecast years. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
High growth has contributed to lowering the 
unemployment rate, which decreased from 11.3% in 
December 2002 to 10.5% in December 2003. 
However, upward pressure on unemployment from 
enterprise and rural restructuring is expected to 
remain. 
In spite of a strong growth performance, and sizeable 
employment gains since 2001, the unemployment 
rateŠwhich remains at around 10.5% of the labour 
forceŠis forecast to drop onlyslightly in the medium 

term, to around 10.1%. Moderate employment gains 
of 0.5% per year over the forecast period will 
contribute to the decline,although considerable 

regional development disparities will hold back a 
faster improvement in labour market conditions.
During 2003, the inflation rate went up to 2.9% from 
a sharp rise in health care costs. Imports also became 
more expensive. Inflation is expected to increase to

4.0% during the forecast period. This rise is linked to 
the expected adjustment of prices to EU levels and 
wage increases. In addition, there will be a new round 

of administrative price hikes. From 2004, an increase 
in excise duties on fuel and petrol will further push 
inflation. However, the full impact of the effect of the 

increase will only be visible in the second half of 
2004 and beginning of 2005. Thereafter inflation is 
set to decelerate. 
The current account 
The growth of exports and imports in 2003 was 
buoyant. Exports increasedby almost 13% in 2003 
while imports increased by 14.3%. Exports are 
expected to expand by 10-8
.5% in 2004 and 2005. 
Imports should grow broadly in line with final 

demand, resulting in a small negative contribution to 
GDP growth from net exports in both years. 
The current account deficit increased to 9.1% of GDP 
in 2003. As the trade balance is expected to worsen, 
this will result in a further rise of the current account 
deficit by about 2 percentage points during the 
forecast period. Public finances 
In 2003, the general government deficit notified by 
the Latvian authorities in March 2004, but subject to 
further verification by Eurostat is one percentage 
point lower than expected in autumn and represents 

1.8% of GDP. This was mainly due to better-than-
expected tax revenues and close monitoring of 
expenditure by the government. The total government 
expenditure did not reachthe initially allocated 
amount. For the forecast period a broadening of the 

VAT base and the real estate tax base should 
outweigh the intended cut in the corporate income tax. 
Consequently, the deficit is expected to approach 2% 

of GDP in 2
004 and 2005.

The situation in 2003 
Lithuania™s macroeconomic performance remained 
particularly strong in 2003. Real output continued 
expanding rapidly and is provisionally estimated to 

have increased by 8.9% in 2003, in the absence of 
significant external and fiscal imbalances and 
inflationary pressures. Domestic demand consolidated 

as the major driver for growth. Private consumption is 
estimated to have grown by above 9% in 2003, 
fuelled by strong employment growth and low interest 

rates. Gross fixed capital formation remained buoyant 
and is forecast to have increased by some 12%, 
induced by favourablecredit conditions and 
reinforced macroeconomic stability. 
Notwithstanding a marked nominal effective 
appreciation of the litas, Lithuania™s export 

performance remained robust in 2003, although 
export growth stood below the impressive levels of 
previous years. Import growth also held strong and 

led to a negative contribution of net trade to growth in 
2003 which, together with a marked deterioration of 
the income account, drove the current account deficit 

above 6% of GDP. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005  
Real GDP growth is foreseen to remain robust at 
about 6.5-7% in 2004 and 2005. Gross fixed capital 
formation is expected to continue growing vigorously, 

stimulated by low interest rates and increasing 
investment grants from the EU, while the anticipated 
recovery of external demand in Lithuania™s major 
trading partners and further productivity gains should 
ensure that the strong export performance is 

sustained. Public consumption growth is expected to 
edge up, partly associated with government™s 
increasing demand for goods and services related to 
the implementation of programmes co-financed by the 
EU. Private consumption is expected to remain firm 
due to sustained employment growth, higher income 

prospects and sharp credit growth. The savings-
investment balance is likely to deteriorate slightly in 
2004, reflecting robust domestic demand, but the 
current account deficit is expected to stabilise 
thereafter at around 6% of GDP, provided that the 

fiscal consolidation plans are attained. Nevertheless, 
the present credit growth dynamics is engendering 
uncertainty about the medium-term developments of 

the private savings-investment balance and increasing 
the risk for higher current account imbalances. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Against the background of buoyant economic growth, 
the labour market has significantly improved in the 

last two years, experiencing high employment growth 
and a decrease in the unemployment rate from 16.1% 
in 2001 to 12.7% in 2003. Employment growth is 

expected to remain relatively high over the forecast 
horizon, induced by strong labour demand by the 
private sector. The unemployment rate is expected to 

decrease to 10.7% in 2005, sustained by strong 
employment growth and the effect of active labour 
market policies. Nevertheless, significant structural 
rigidities in the labour market related to low 
workforce mobility and mismatches between demand 

and supply of skills constitute a risk for the 
projections. 
Strong productivity gains,moderate wage inflation 
and a large effective appreciation of the litas 

contributed to an annual average deflation rate of 
1.1% in 2003 (as measured by HICP). The deflation 
trend is expected to start reversing in the second half 

of 2004 and inflation is expected to progressively pick 
up to about 2.2% by 2005. Higher priceswill be 
initially influenced by tax alignments due to EU 

accession such as changes excise rates on fuel and 
tobacco products and the elimination of a reduced 
VAT rate on heating of residential buildings. Other 

factors are expected to add more pressure on prices, 
such as accelerating wage inflation, price increases

among the regulated sectors and higher prices of 
public transport. Nevertheless, maintaining inflation 
at around the foreseen levels will largely depend on a 

rapid implementation of structural reforms that allow 
Lithuania to sustain the current productivity growth 
trend, so as to temper the impact on unit labour costs. 

The expected inflation scenario assumes that fiscal 
policy will shift away fromthe present pro-cyclical 
stance in 2005. Public finance 
The declining trend of the general government deficit 
reversed in 2003, when the deficit increased slightly 
to 1.7% of GDP, from 1.4 % in 2002. The increase 

was largely due to higher current expenditure (mainly 
in the form of agricultural subsidies and 
compensations for the loss of rouble savings) 
allocated through a supplementary budget in July 

2003.The general government deficit is expected to 
increase further to 2.8% of GDP in 2004, primarily 
led by a surge in public investment, salary increases 

for non-civil servant public workers and the transition 
costs of the pension reform. Fiscal consolidation is 
expected to resume from 2005, when the deficit is 

expected to drop to 2.6% of GDP. The fiscal 
projections assume that government arrears on VAT 
refunds owned by the government to enterprises, 
which increased significantly in 2001 and 2002, are 
gradually reduced.

857. Malta Fiscal challenges lie ahead The economy in 2003 
The Maltese economy largely weathered the effects of 
the international deceleration in 2002, but failed to 
maintain speed in2003. On the whole, real GDP grew 

by1.7%in2002 and 0.4% in 2003. Real growth 
contracted by 1.9% in the first quarter of 2003, but 
gathered momentum in the second and third quarters, 

increasing by 0.7% and 1.9% respectively. This trend 
was not entirely consolidatedin the fourth quarter. 
Economic growth in 2003 was driven by high public 

expenditure and a sudden spark in gross fixed capital 
formation, which led to an increase in imports. 
Uncertainty in international markets, especially 
faltering demand for semiconductors, negatively 
influenced export growth in2003, but it is likely to 

improve gradually as the expected strengthening of 
the technological sector in the United States and Asia 
occurs. Poor results in the tourist sector could not 

compensate for a deterioration of the current account 
balance by 1.3 percentage points.  The consumer price 
index decelerated to 1.3% in 2003, stemming from 

subdued domestic demand and a low pass-through of 
the Maltese lira depreciation against the euro. Lower 
activity in the tourist sector and industrial 

restructuring in manufacturing caused considerable 
job losses and negatively influenced employment 
developments. The rate of unemployment worsened to 

8.2% in 2003, from 7.5% in 2002. The general 
government deficit will jumpto 9.7% of GDP in 2003 
from 5.7% in 2002. This one-off rise is explained by 

the impact of the shipyards restructuring in 2003. As a 
result, the debt ratio will soar around 7.8 percentage 
points, to 72.0% of GDP in 2003.
Prospects  
The immediate outlook for the Maltese economy is 
for a gradual recovery in the growth rate to 1.4% in 

2004, accelerating to 2% in 2005, supported by the 
improvement in external demand and capital 
formation. The accomplishment of the necessary 

structural reforms, coupled with the requirement to 
reduce the huge public finance imbalance and reduce 
public debt will set the pace for economic 
developments in Malta.  
GDP components  
Private consumption is foreseen to remain below 
historical rates as the situation in the labour market 

and, to a lesser extent, the recent VAT increase are 
likely to dampen eventual improvements in household 
disposable income. Despite previous high government 

consumption stemming from mandatory and quasi-
mandatory expenditure, this variable is expected to 
decelerate in the forthcoming years as a response to 

maintain fiscal stringency to bring the public deficit 
down to sustainable levels.  The key drivers of GDP 
growth will be external demand, where exports are 

projected to increase by 1.4% in 2004 and 2.8 % in 
2005, reflecting better economic conditions in Malta™s 
main trading partners, and gross fixed capital 
formation expected to grow 4.2% and 2.6% in 2004 
and 2005, respectively, inducedby stronger demand 
in the manufacturing sector, public works and 

industrial restructuring.  Due to the very open 
character of the Maltese economy, imports are 
estimated to grow by 2.7%in the period, while the 
current account balance will slightly improve in 2005, 
supported by a recovery in tourism revenue and net 

transfers from the EU. 
Costs and prices 
 As a result of a VAT increase at the beginning of 
2004, the rate of inflation islikely to increase in the 
first half of the year, but the removal of  agriculture 

and food levies as from May 1
stwill ease pressures 
on the consumer price index (CPI). As long as world 
primary commodity prices and oil prices variations 

remain moderate, significant price increases are not 
expected, the CPI staying stable at slightly above 2% 
in the period.

Labour market 
The survey-based unemployment rate attained 8.2% 
in December 2003. This was due to poor economic 
growth, the implementation of early retirement 

schemes linked to industrialrestructuring, notably in 
the shipyards. Furthermore, previous rises in public 
wages spilled over to the private sector and 

subsequently increased unit labour costs. The 
unemployment rate is forecast to further deteriorate in 
2004 to 8.6%, to improve gradually in 2005, provided 

labour costs could be kept under control to regain 
competitiveness and accelerate employment creation. 
Public finances 
High mandatory and quasi-mandatory expenditures, 
healthcare and pension systems, early retirement 
schemes associated with shipyard restructuring, lower 
than expected tax collection due to the economic 

slowdown and large outlays connected to the 
construction of the new Mater Dei Hospital are 
overloading public deficit and public debt figures. In 
addition to this, the shipyards restructuring in 2003 
brought about a one-off rise in public liabilities which 

led general government deficit to 9.7% of GDP. As a 
result, the debt-to GDP ratio climbed to 72% of GDP 
in 2003. The recent tax rises and budgetary control 

streamlining, expected economic recovery and the 
impact of EU financing on the budget as from May 1
stshould bring the  down ge
neral government deficit to 
5.9% and 4.5% of GDP in 2004 and 2005 
respectively.  As a result, a slowdown in the increase 
in the public debt ratio might be expected from 2004.

878. Poland Abroad-based recovery underpinned by an expansionary fiscal policy in 
2004Economic situation in 2003 
After the economic slowdown experienced in 2001-
02, the recovery gained strength in 2003
.Real GDP growth accelerated to an impressive 4.7% year-on-
year in the fourth quarter of 2003 from 2.2% in the 

first quarter, bringing growth for 2003 as a whole to 
3.7% compared to 1.4% in 2002. The driving force 
behind growth last year was net exports, boosted by 

the sharp real effective depreciation of the zloty. 
Private consumption was held back by weak real 
income growth, while fixed investment contracted for 

the third consecutive year, although less than in 
previous years. The economic upswing was helped by 
an accommodative fiscal policy and more favourable 
monetary conditions, resulting from the easing of 
monetary policy and the depreciation of the currency 
against the euro.  
Prospects in 2004 and 2005 
Real GDP growth is projected to gradually accelerate 
to 4.6% in 2004 and 4.8% in2005. Net exports will 

continue to support growth this year but their 
contribution will turn negative next year. Domestic 
demand will strengthen over the forecast period, with 
rising consumer demand and an expected rebound in 

investment. In addition, against the background of 
easier monetary conditions, the substantial loosening 
of fiscal policy this year will provide an additional 
stimulus to growth.  
GDP components 
Boosted by increasing corporate profits, an improving 
economic outlook and EU accession, investment is 

projected to pick up in 2004 and grow more strongly 

in 2005, thus widening the base of the recovery. 
Investment activity began to recover, but only timidly, 
in the third quarter of 2003 and should gradually 

strengthen this year and next. Provided that access to 
finance improves for firms, investment growth could 
get close to 10% in volume terms in 2005.  
Private consumption is projected to accelerate only 
moderately this year, as wage growth will remain 
subdued given the still difficult situation in the labour 

market. Another restraining factor is the pick-up in 
inflation that will reduce households™ real incomes. 
Growing consumer confidence and improved 

employment prospects should lead to faster consumer 
spending in 2005.  
Export growth is expected to remain robust, supported 
by the depreciation of the zloty, productivity gains of 

Polish companies and the growth revival in Poland™s 
main trading partners. Import growth will rise in 
parallel with the recovery in investment activity and is 

projected to outpace export growth in 2005. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The unemployment rate stabilised at the very high 
level of 19.8% of the labour force in 2003. Despite 

the acceleration of growth, employment growth is set 

to increase only moderately in a context of still large 
job losses linked to the ongoing restructuring process 
in industry and agriculture. Employment growth will 

not be strong enough to makea substantial dent in the 
level of unemployment, which is projected to stay 
high at 19.3% of the labour force in 2005. 
The recovery will gradually increase inflationary 
pressures that remained subdued in 2003 in a context 
of moderate wage growth and weak domestic 

demand. The forecast predicts a sharp increase in 
inflation from the very low level of 0.7% on average 
in 2003 to 3.0% in2005.The inflationary push will 

come from the acceleration of domestic demand, the 
pass-through of the currency depreciation and 
accession-related tax and price adjustments. However, 

inflation will remain within the target range set by the 
National Bank of Poland (2.5% +/- 1 percentage 
point).

External accounts Reflecting strong export growth and weak imports, 
the current account deficit narrowed to 2.0% of GDP 
last year. A still good performance from exports will 
limit the increase in the current account deficit in 

2004, but following stronger import growth, the 
deficit is projected to widen more markedly in 2005, 
reaching 2.8% of GDP compared to 2.3% in 2004. 

Higher transfers from the EU will cushion the current 
account deficit and improve the balance on the capital 
account.Public finances 
In 2003, the general government deficit is estimated 
to be slightly lower than expected in the autumn and 

represents 4.1% of GDP. As the Eurostat 
communiqué (issued 2 March) on the classification of 
funded pension schemes is of a generic nature with 
the individual cases being analysed bilaterally, the 
forecast still considers the open pension funds as part 
of the government sector (reducing the deficit by 
1.6% of GDP).  
In 2004, notwithstanding the strengthening of 
economic growth, the general government deficit is 
projected to increase su
bstantially to 6% of GDP 
(compared to a government target of 5.7%). Eventual 
savings, announced in the Hausner plan, will be offset 
by additional expenditures resulting from a higher 

indexation of disability pensions and the unforeseen 
magnitude of the zloty depreciation in 2003 inducing 
an increased contribution to the EU budget. Revenues 
would decrease following the lowering of the 
corporate income tax rate and the change in the VAT 
legislation.It is projected that the deficit will fall in 2005 to 4.5% 
of GDP. The improvement of the deficit would be 
mainly cyclical and reflect positive net inflows from 

the EU budget. The forecast takes into account 
savings voted in Parliament in March 2004. The gross 
debt ratio is estimated to have reached 45.4% of GDP 
in 2003 and would increase to over 50% by the end of 
2005.  Table 4.8

899. Slovakia Robust growth continues Growth in 2003 
In 2003, real GDP growth remained robust but slowed 
down slightly to 4.2% (from 4.4% in 2002) and its 
composition turned around. Whereas, in the year 

before, domestic demand had been the main growth 
engine, its growth contribution (including stock-
building) became negative in 2003. Private 

consumption was dampened significantly by fiscal 
restraint and adjustments in administered prices and 
contracted. So did gross fixed capital formation.  In 

spite of the lacklustre performance of Slovakia™s main 
export markets and reflecting the creation of 
significant new export capacity, exports of goods and 
services rose strongly by some 23%, outpacing import 
growth of about 14% and leading to a net external 

contribution to GDP growth
 of 6.5 percentage points. 
Growth prospects  
In 2004 and 2005, growth is predicted to stay at 
approximately the same level as in 2003. Domestic 
demand is expected to contribute positively to growth 

again (by some 3 to 4 percentage points), in 
consequence of a gradual acceleration of private 
consumption and a strong pick-up in gross fixed 

capital formation. The latter is not least due to already 
announced greenfield investments. Export growth 
rates are anticipated at close to 10%. In tandem with 

domestic demand, imports are expected to grow at 
similar rates. Altogether, the growth contribution by 
external demand should hover around zero. 
InflationAs the government continues to adjust administered 
prices and indirect taxes, headline inflation will 
prospectively be around 8% in 2004. In 2003, it 
reached 8½ %, while core inflation averaged 2.6 %. 
Assuming that second-round effects are kept under 
control, significant disinflation should be possible in 

2005 -- leading to an i
nflation rate of around 4½ %. 
Current account 
Dominated by a very strong export performance, the 
current account deficit narrowed from slightly over 
8% of GDP in 2002 to less than 1% of GDP in 2003. 
Foreign trade developments will continue to be the 
main factor behind the current account deficit. 
Accordingly, the current account deficit should widen 
again in 2004 and 2005, owing, inter alia, to higher 
investment-related imports. However, it is likely to 

stay significantly below 5 % of GDP.  
Labour market 
After a significant rise in 2002 resulting from a virtual 
halt in administered price adjustments, real wages 
declined again in 2003 (by roughly 1½ %). They are 

expected to continue to doso in 2004. A return of 
positive real wage growth rates is not forecast before 
2005.Unemployment has been slowly but steadily falling 
from its peak above 19% in 2001. It amounted to an 
average of around 17% in2003. In spite of still 
continuing enterprise restructuring, it is set for a 

further decline to close to some 16 % in 2005 Œ the 
main reason being a more decisive policy stance in 
tackling the deep-seated structural labour market 
shortcomings. 
Public finances 
The general government deficit reached 5.7% of GDP 
in the election year 2002. 
After the elections in September 2002, the new 
Slovak authorities initiated a fiscal turn-around, 
aiming at a general government deficit target of 5% of 
GDP for 2003. With a deficit of 3.6% of GDP, the 

government has substantially over-performed on this 
target. At the beginning of 2004, a far-reaching tax 
reform was implemented, consisting mainly of

introduction of a flat incometax and a unified value 
added tax, both at a rate of 19%. Estimates suggest 
that the tax reform is likely to be broadly revenue-

neutral. Against this backdrop, it is projected that the 
government will broadly meet its deficit target of 4% 
of GDP for 2004.  
For 2005, the deficit forecast is roughly 4 % of GDP, 
since the government has not yet taken any measures 
to compensate for the effects of the introduction of a 
mandatory funded pension pillar in that year. These 

effects are not yet included in the government™s 
announced deficit target of 3.1% of GDP.   
Risks to this scenario stem in particular from the 
fundamental nature of the taxreforms, which make 
revenue forecasts relatively uncertain. In addition, 
there remain uncertainties on the expenditure side, in 

particular in connection with health reform measures.

9110. Slovenia Inflation continues to be on a declining trendThe economy in 2003  
The Slovene economy is showing a remarkable 
resilience; the real GDP growth rate averaged 4% in 
1995-2002. For 2003, however, growth is estimated to 

have decelerated to 2.3%, mainly due to modest 
export expansion. Domestic demand, on the other 
hand, remained buoyant. Strong credit growth and 

moderate real wage increases kept private 
consumption robust. Investment expenditure was also 
booming, but it is doubtful whether the expansion in 

gross capital formation truly reflects investors™ 
optimism about future prospects as business 
confidence has been fading and stocks have increased. 
Imports of investment goods were exceptionally 
strong in the second half of 2003. Export growth, on 

the other hand, decelerated further in the unfavourable 
international environment; a weak EU economy, the 
main trade partner for Slovenia, failed to provide 

adequate demand while market growth of CEFTA 
(Central European Free Trade Agreement), Russia 
and former Yugoslavia did not compensate 

sufficiently, unlike in 2002. The net external demand 
contribution to growth turned negative while the 
current account surplus quickly eroded, coming close 

to a balance much sooner than expected. Moreover, in 
2003 a net outflow of FDI was registered for the first 
time.  
Outlook for 2004-2005  
The forecast projects a gradual recovery of the 
economy. This year, an upturn is anticipated as export 
growth picks up while domestic demand continues to 
strengthen. Both consumption and investment 
expenditure are expected to grow further, following a 

boost in construction activity stimulated by credit 
demand from the national housing saving scheme, and 
increasing exports, linked to a revived EU economy, 

market competition and enterprise restructuring. 
Imports are also set to rise slightly, in step with 
strengthened domestic (investment) demand and 

exports. All in all, real GDP growth should accelerate 
to 3.6% in 2005 whereas the current account will turn 
(marginally) negative in 2004 and 2005. 
Prices and wages  
Inflation has declined markedly in the last two years Œ 
the average rate of consumer price growth dropped 
from 8.6% in 2001 to 5.7% in 2003 Œ but is still 

relatively high. After adopting a programme on ERM-
II participation and adoption of the euro, the 
government enforced co-ordination of economic 

policies so as to meet conditions for early EMU entry. 
An anti-inflationary policy commitment was met 
through caps on administered price rises and indirect 

taxes as well as frequent adjustments of excise duties 
on oil. Also, in pursuing the objective of a generalised 
de-indexation of the economy, backward-looking 

indexation mechanisms have been further weakened. 
After de-indexation of interest rates, a wage 
agreement for public sector wages was concluded in 

July 2003 introducing forward-looking indexation 
with anticipated rather thanactual domestic inflation 
and also taking into account EU inflation and the 
euro/tolar exchange rate. Furthermore, monetary 
policy has been geared towards slowing the 

depreciation of the currency, thus somewhat 
compressing the inherent inflationary pass through. In 
2003, the Bank of Slovenia lowered the interest rates 

by a cumulative 225 basis points. However, bringing 
down inflation sustainably might prove difficult to 
achieve as inflationary pressures continue to be fed by 

slow liberalisation in various sectors, inflexible labour 
markets, and remaining indexation mechanisms
.In 
addition, steady disinflation might be under pressure 

in an environment of rallying private consumption. 
The public finance stance is therefore being further 
strengthened.

In 2003, the labour market remained weak with a 
slight fall in employment and an increase of 
unemployment.  This year the unemployment rate is 

to return to past levels of slightly above 6% and then 
resume its gradual trend decline as GDP growth 
strengthens.  
External sector 
A slow recovery in the EU weighed on Slovenia™s 
external sector position. 2003 saw a larger trade deficit and a smaller surplus in services as compared 
to the year before, roughlybalancing out the current 
account. The deterioration in the current account is 
expected to continue moderately in 2004 and 2005, 
partly attenuated by the capital transfers from the EU 
funds.    
Public finance  
After unexpected setbacks in previous years, fiscal 
consolidation seemed to be well on track. Although 
the 2003 budget was amended during the year - a 

common practice in previous years, as well - the 
general government deficit was 1.8% of GDP, slightly 
better than projected, and this against the background 

of faltering growth. The general government budget 
deficit is projected to remainbroadly stable, thanks to 
expenditure limits while a decline in revenues due to 

the direct tax reform is compensated by an inflow of 
EU funds. Nevertheless, a potential revision of the 
government accounts, linked to the sectoral re-
classification of some public institutions, may 
improve or worsen the deficit marginally (about 0.2% 

of GDP).

Rebalancing domestic and external demand 
The economy in 2003 
Real GDP growth of 4.3% was based on very strong 
domestic demand, coming in particular from private 
consumption and investment.  This was due to 

increases in employment and net income as well as, 
most importantly, a considerable surge in bank 
credits, although from a low base. Since many of the 

demanded products, mostly durable consumer goods 
and investment goods, are not produced domestically, 
imports increased by almost 20% in real terms.  As a 

consequence, net exports had a very strong negative 
contribution to GDP growth. 
Consumer price inflation was very low in the first half 
of 2003, also because of low import prices, but picked 
up again in the second half following increases in 
administered prices and food prices.  This resulted in 

a low average inflation rate and a higher end-of-year 
inflation rate.  Unemployment decreased significantly 
as a result of net job creation in both the private sector 

and government employment schemes.  However, 
there is also a statistical effect from measures 
introduced to enforce the existence of labour 

contracts.  
Preliminary data set the current account deficit at a 
record 8.6% of GDP, largely because of a high trade 
deficit.  However, these figures might be subject to 

revision at a later stage since net errors and omissions 
are currently at 2.5% of GDP.  Net inflows of foreign 
direct investment (FDI) have been very high at 6.8% 

of GDP. Since these are not only related to 
privatisation, but to a large part to the expansion of 
existing or the creation of new production capacity, 
they have contributed to theimport boom.  In view of 
the deterioration of the current account and the 

revenue over-performance which had resulted in a 
cash surplus peaking at 2.8% of GDP in October, the 
general government deficit - initially targeted at 0.7% 

of GDP - was revised and turned out close to balance 
at the end of the year. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate further to 
rates of 5% in 2004 and 5½% in 2005 on the basis of 
a rebalancing of domestic and external demand.  Main 
assumptions are an acceleration of activity in the 

economies of Bulgaria™s main trading partners, in 
particular in the enlarged EU, as well as a continued 
prudent economic policy oriented towards 

macroeconomic stability and structural reforms. 
The acceleration of GDP growth is expected to go 
along with a significant change in its composition 
compared to 2003.  Given that households and firms 

face increased indebtedness and that banks are 
becoming gradually more constrained in additional 
lending, private consumption and investment as well 

as imports should rise at more moderate rates than in 
2003 while exports could increase more strongly.  
However, improved business opportunities expected 

from EU accession and rising net income should 
prevent domestic demand from decelerating more 
significantly.  
Increases of excise taxes and of energy prices suggest 
a somewhat higher average inflation rate in 2004.  If 
wage increases remain moderate, average consumer 
price inflation is likely to see rates of 6% in 2004 and 
of 4½% in 2005. 
The projected GDP growth will allow net 
employment gains of 1.5% per year in 2004 and 2005.  

This will make it possible to lower the unemployment 
rate further if the active population remains broadly 
constant because the induced increasing participation 

rate corresponds to the declining share of the 
working-age population.

Public finances and current account 
An improved external environment and less strong 
domestic demand will allow improving the external 
position.  Also, the substantial investment over the 

last years should gradually have a positive effect on 
external competitiveness.  Therefore, the trade and 
current account deficit can be expected to decrease, 

also as a result of favourable terms of trade.  The 
significant difference between the trade and current 
account deficit arises from high net exports of 

services, in particular tourism, as well as received net 
current transfers, also from the EU.  However, the 
income balance will remain negative in the years to 
come because of the repatriation of profits from FDI 
and, although declining, payments for servicing 

foreign debt.  As in 2003, FDI could again be at 
record levels in 2004 due to the finalisation of the last 
major privatisation deals, while greenfield investment 

continues to be high. 
In view of the link between the current account and 
the fiscal position through the investment-savings 
balance, the forecast assumes that fiscal policy 
remains prudent.  For 2004 the expected deficit 

amounts to 0.7% of GDP. However, the election year 
2005 could see a small widening of the budget deficit 
to 1% of GDP.  The commitment to reducing the 

expenditure-to-GDP ratio, which actually increased in 
2003 because of the good revenue performance, 
implies that public consumption should expand by 

less than GDP in 2004 and 2005 which is in line with 
income tax reductions implemented at the beginning 
of 2004.  The assumed continuation of a primary 
surplus and of high GDP growth will further reduce 
the public-debt-to-GDP ratio.

972.Romania
Sustained growth and pro-cyclical fiscal stancecause weak current account The economy in 2003  
In 2003, Romania™s four-year old economic recovery 
weathered the economic slowdown in the EU as 
growth remained robust.  According to preliminary 

figures, real GDP growth reached 4.9% in 2003.  
However, growth was increasingly unbalanced and 
driven mainly by domestic demand.  In particular, 

household consumption rose sharply at a pace of 7.1% 
on the back of surging consumer credit and high wage 
growth.  Moreover, with a real growth of 4.6% 

government consumption expanded considerably 
more than expected.  Gross fixed capital formation 
rose rapidly at 9.2%, pointing to the ongoing 
replacement of Romania™s capital stock.  
The strong domestic demand led to a sustained import 
growth of 16.3%.  With export growth decelerating, 

reaching 11.1% for the year, export performance 
appeared less vigorous compared to previous years.  
This was also reflected inindustrial production 

growing at a significantly lower pace in 2003 than in 
previous years.  Consequently, a significant 
deterioration of the trade balance occurred, and, after 

contributing positively to growth in 2002, net exports 
turned strongly negative during2003.  As a result, the 
current account deficit widened significantly over 
2003.  After dropping sharply to 3.5% of GDP in 
2002, the cumulative current account deficit rose 
again to 5.9% of GDP in 2003.  
Prospects for 2004 and 2005  
The outlook for the Romanian economy points to 
sustained economic growth, slowly declining 
unemployment and further disinflation.  Relative to 

the Autumn 2003 forecast, the significant 
deterioration in the trade balance in 2003 and a 
sharper acceleration in domestic demand cause an 

upward revision in the current account deficit over the 
forecast period.  Based on a no-policy-change 
assumption, the continuation of a pro-cyclical fiscal 

stance leads to government expenditure for 2004 
being revised upwards.  
GDP growth and components 
After reaching 4.9% in 2003, GDP growth is expected 
to accelerate due to sustained domestic demand. 
Household consumption is expected to decelerate 
slightly, although further real wage growth and a 

permanent effect on disposable income from lower 
social security contribution underpin demand. 
Consumer credits are expected to grow at a more 

moderate pace.  Growth of investment is expected to 
remain high over the forecast period due to the 
ongoing modernisation of production facilities and a 

structural change towards less labour-intensive 
production.  Export market growth, stronger inflows 
of FDI and improved access to financing will also 

support investments.  For 2004 and 2005, net exports 
are expected to remain negative, but at a level more 
compatible with a sustainable current account deficit. 
InflationIn 2003, consumer price inflation remained on a 
downward path with the year-on-year inflation rate 
declining to 14.1% in December, thereby allowing the 

central bank™s target to be met.  For 2004 and 2005, 
inflation is expected to bebrought further down in 
line with the disinflation target of the authorities.  In 

view of the robust activity, expectations of high wage 
growth, still insufficient financial discipline, some 
downward pre
ssure on the currency and needed 
upwards adjustment of administered prices the target 
remains, however, ambitious. After accelerating in the 
first half of 2003, the pace of real wage growth 

moderated in the latter part of the year, resulting in an 
average real wage increase of 8.7% in 2003. Albeit 
lower, real wage growth is projected to remain robust 

in 2004 and 2005, due to further productivity gains.

Labour market 
Continued growth in employment will allow the 
reduction in unemployment despite lay-offs incurred 
by continued economic restructuring.  A broadly 

stable labour force supports this reduction.  Labour 
market trends should be interpreted with caution as 
they are affected by revisions and changing 

methodology.Public finances 
The fiscal stance in 2003 turned pro-cyclical as 
revenue gains were largely spent towards the end of 
the year.  Strong growth in tax revenue and further 
savings on interest paymentsresulted, however, in an 
undershooting of the deficit target for 2003, reaching 

2.0% according to ESA 95 standards.  The general 
government deficit is expected to reach 3.0% in 2004 
and 2005 on the back of continued high spending and 

more subdued revenue growth.  However, a more 
restrictive fiscal policy for 2004 than originally 
intended might be the result of a planned pre-
cautionary stand-by arrangement with the IMF.  
External balance For 2004 and 2005, the external balance is expected 
to improve.  Private consumption and investment will 

continue to drive imports up, and the pro-cyclical 
fiscal stance also sustains high demand.  Yet, import 
growth should, nevertheless, be moderate, as 

exceptional cereal imports in 2003 will not be 
repeated.  Export markets are expected to 
progressively pick up and export growth is likely to 
outpace market growth.  As higher transfers are 
expected to mitigate the worsening in net factor 

income and the services balance will remain in 
surplus, the current account deficit is expected to 
narrow gradually.

993.Turkey 
Realising its potential? The economy in 2003 
During 2003, economic stabilisation has continued, 
with a marked broadening of the sources of growth.  
Economic activity accelerated particularly strong in 

the last quarter of the year, leading to an overall 
output growth of 5.8% in 2003. The main driving 
forces for this strong recovery have been private 

consumption and investment. However, the strength 
of domestic demand also translated into a substantial 
increase in imports, which led to a substantial 

widening of the trade deficit.  Inflationary pressures 
continued to decline, reflecting weak domestic 
demand, the strength of the Turkish currency and the 
strict fiscal policy of the Turkish authorities.  As a 
result, year-end consumer price inflation was 

markedly below the target of 20%. Restructuring and 
labour shedding in the manufacturing sector led to a 
further decline in employment by 0.3%.  Unemploy-

ment continued to increase.  Public finances remained 
largely on track, achieving a primary surplus of 9.6% 
of GDP.  This substantial surplus and strong GDP 

growthled to a sharp reduction in the debt ratio, from 
94% of GDP in 2002 to 87% in 2003.  The current 
account deficit widened considerably (from 0.8% of 

GDP in 2002 to about 2 ¾% of GDP in 2003), 
reflecting accelerating domestic demand and the 
strength of the currency.  
Prospects in 2004 and 2005 
The overall picture for the forecasting period looks 
favourable.  The expected strengthening of inter-
national demand should help to maintain strong 
export growth, while the foreseen decline in import 
prices will support the current disinflation process.  

The continued decline in inflationary pressures will 
improve predictability and allow for a decline in 
interest rates and improve the environment for 

investment.  Overall, economic output is expected to 
increase by about 4½% in 2004, after a rise of close to 
6% in 2003
.  The slowdown in 2004 marks the ending 
of the post-crisis recovery and, possibly, the start of a 
more balanced growth path.  In 2005, growth is 
expected to accelerate to 5% again.  The decision of 
the European Council in December 2004 of whether 
or not to start negotiations might have an important 

impact on Turkey™s next year™s economic dynamics.  
However, any possible impact of this decision has not 
been incorporated into the current forecast.  
GDP components  
Output growth is expected tobe increasingly driven 
by domestic demand components, in particular private 
consumption and private investment. Declining 
inflation will support disposable income and allow 

consumers to realise consumption, which had to be 
postponed during the first years after the crisis.  As a 
result, private consumption is expected to increase by 

about 4¾% and 5% in 2004-2005 and will therefore 
be the most important source of growth.  Fixed 
investment will benefit from reduced macroeconomic 

and political uncertainty, declining real interest rates 
and the need to modernise the capital stock after three 
years of weak investment. On the other hand, the 
build-up of stocks is expectedto come to an end in 
2004.  The strong consumption and investment will 

lead to continued high growth of imports, in particular 
of consumer durables and capital goods.  Exports 
should benefit from the improvement in Turkey™s 

main export markets.  However, the relative strength 
of the Turkish currency will make it more difficult for 
exporters to benefit from the improving trade 

opportunities. 
InflationThe trend in declining inflationary pressures is likely 
to continue.  Fiscal discipline, improving credibility 
of the Central Bank™s disinflation targets and the 

recent strength of the currency are important elements 
in this respect.

Labour market 
So far, the economic acceleration has not yet fed 
through to the labour market.  The forecast expects 
that the broadening of the economic expansion to 

more labour-intensive industries will lead to stronger 
employment creation. Turkey™s rapidly growing 
labour force will, however, outpace labour supply and 

only a further decline in the participation ratio will 
allow for a small reduction in open unemployment. 
Public finances  
The public sector imbalances are likely to decline 
markedly during 2004-2005,benefiting from the 
sustained recovery, declining interest rates driven by 
improved market confidence and a prudent fiscal 

policy stance.  The ongoing public finance reforms 
will help to widen the tax base and to increase the 
efficiency of tax collection. Non-interest expenditures 

are seen to remain largely constant as a percentage of 
GDP.  In view of the still considerable burden of debt 
servicing for Turkey™s fiscal policy, fiscal discipline 
and the continuation of the current stability oriented 
policy approach is of utmost importance for 
maintaining the sustainability of Turkey™s public 

finances.  
External balanceIn view of the strengthening domestic demand, a 
deterioration of the external balance is expected.  The 
current account deficit is expected to reach about 

3¾% of GDP in 2005.

101Chapter 6 Other non-EU countries 1.United States of America 
High growth rates, but concerns about sustainability A strengthening and broadening recovery  
The recovery in the United States gained considerable 
momentum in the course of 2003. Annualized GDP 
growth advanced from a sluggish rate below 2% in 
the winter of 2002/03 to more than 4% at the end of 

the year. The annual growth rate for 2003 turned out 
to be 3.1%. Growth became also more balanced with 
business equipment investment and exports 

registering the first full-year gains since 2000.  
So far the recovery has not resulted in much 
employment growth. Non-farm payroll employment 
actually fell until August 2003 and has only advanced 
at an annualized rate of 0.6% since then. However, 

due to a fall in the labour force, the unemployment 
rate retreated to 5.6% in February 2004. In contrast to 
employment, labour productivity has continued to 

advance strongly. Output per hour in the non-farm 
business sector increased by 4.4% in 2003 on an 
annual basis. Due to strongproductivity growth and a 

considerable slack in resource utilization, prices have 
been under downward pressure with overall and 
‚core™ CPI inflation falling to 1.7%, respectively 

1.2%, on a year-on-year basis by February 2004. With 
only small gains in hourly compensation, unit labour 
costs declined and profit margins surged to a long-

time high. The ﬁtwin deficitsﬂ set new annual records 
in 2003: the current account deficit reached 4.7% of 
GDP on a national account basis (4.9% on a balance-

of-payments basis) and the fiscal deficit of general 
government came in at 4.8% of GDP. 
Can the momentum be sustained?  
The recovery continues to benefit from a very 
expansionary macro-economic policy. Much of last 
year™s tax cuts are materializing in the form of tax 
rebates in the first half of 2004. Monetary policy 
remains very accommodative with the federal funds 

rate at 1%. Long-term interest rates resumed their 
downward trend last autumn which has prolonged the 
boom in mortgage refinancing activity. Financial 

market conditions have also been eased by large gains 
in equity prices since their trough in March 2003. 
The effects of the macro-economic expansion are 
bound to fade within the forecast period. By the 
second half of 2004 fiscal policy will turn more 
restrictive reflecting the one-off nature of the current 
tax refunds and the discontinuation of child tax credit 
checks. The Administration™s budget proposal for 

fiscal year 2005 does not promise additional stimulus 
from the federal budget. Although the recent easing of 
financial conditions in conjunction with the ongoing 

house price boom is likelyto bolster household 
spending for a while, most of the monetary stimulus 
seems to have been spent. And the Federal Reserve™s 

next change of interest rates, although not imminent, 
is likely to be a tightening. 
Against this background, doubts remain whether the 
current expansion has become, or is about to become, 
self-sustaining. The broadeni
ng of growth 
to include 
business equipment investment and, to some extent, 

exports gives rise to optimism.Strong productivity 
growth and high profit margins should keep 
investment activity going. The recovery is also 

expected to benefit from a somewhat more substantial 
rise in payrolls and labour income. However, the 
household balance sheet situation has become 
precarious. Household debt has increased by 10% 
annually over the past two years, more than twice as 

fast as personal disposableincomes. Personal saving 
as a percentage of disposable personal income fell to 
2.1% in 2003. A rising debt service burden and/or a 

cutback in debt accumulation is likely to reduce the 
growth rate of household spending later this year and 
in 2005. At the same time, high energy prices are 

sapping purchasing power from consumers. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
The forecast sees growth remaining at an annual rate 
of 4% until the middle of2004. Subsequently, a 
moderation in consumer spending growth is projected 
to lower the overall growth rate to the 2-3% range for 
a while before it returns to the 3-4% range in 2005.

Forecast
104Chapter 6 Other non-EU countries, United States of America
Due to a large statistical overhang from last year, the 
annual growth rate would reach 4.2% this year. For 
2005, the annual growth rate would be 3.2% which is 

close to the estimated long-term growth potential of 
the US economy. Inflation isexpected to recede 
further since the output gap would not be closed 

completely by the end of the forecast period. 
Employment is projected to increase at a moderate 
rate with unemployment remaining broadly 

unchanged at the current level. Exports should pick up 
against the background of the dollar depreciation in 
2002-03 and robust world economic growth. But 
import growth should also remain high this year 
resulting in a current account deficit of 5.2% of GDP. 

However, the external deficit should fall back to 5% 
in 2005 as import growth decelerates. The fiscal 
deficit of general government is projected to decline 

to 4.5% of GDP this year and to 4.2%% next year. 
Risks to the forecast  
The risks of this forecast with regard to growth seem 
to be evenly balanced. Onthe upside, it is possible 
that employment growth will take off more forcefully 

than predicted, creating st
ronger income growth and 
consumption. The wealth effect from the surge in 
equity and house prices may also turn out to be 
stronger than expected. On the downside, the major 
risk seems to be associated with the household 
balance sheet situation. Some of it has been built into 

the forecast, but households may try to improve their 
balance sheets more aggressively leading to a sharper 
retrenchment in consumer spending. This could 
particularly happen in conjunction with a reversal of 
the upward trend in asset prices. Both equities and 

houses seem to be richly valued in a long-term 
historical perspective.   Table 6.1

1052.Japan
Export-driven recovery starting to broaden The recovery surprised on the upside in 2003– 
Real GDP growth in 2003 surprised on the upside 
(2.7%) and, in particular, th
e fourth quarter came out 
very strong, boosted by private investment and a 

continued sharp acceleration in export growth
1.In line with the acceleration in global trade in the 
second half of the year, export growth took off in the 
last two quarters. Japan is clearly benefiting from the 

dynamism in the rest of Asia and more than 80% of 
the increase in exports last year was destined to 
China, although the US remains the final destination 
for part of these goods.  
The export-initiated recovery has started to permeate 
through the rest of the economy. Stronger corporate 

profits have supported robust growth in equipment 
investment. Employment growth has been slow in 
responding, but real wages have started to stabilize 

from their previous decline and as such backed 
moderate growth in private consumption.  
– and should remain firm over the forecast years 
Most indicatorspoint to that the recovery should 
remain firm. Both corporate and consumer confidence 

have improved steadily and there are more and more 
signs that the rise in sales, profits and investment are 
spreading beyond the large manufacturing companies.  
The strong acceleration inexport growth that took 
place in the second half of 2003 is likely to continue 
in the short term, although ata somewhat slower pace, 
as indicated by data on orders from abroad. However, 
the drive from external demand is heavily dependent 
on continued dynamism in the East-Asian region and, 

although to a lesser extent,the development of the 
exchange rate.
Indicators for private consumption, such as the 
household survey, shipments of consumer goods and 

retail sales, suggest a rebound in growth in the 
beginning of 2004. Prospects of employment growth 
in the short term together with an expected gradual 

rise in wages should support continued growth in 
household consumption.  
A number of factors indicate that the recovery trend in 
private capital expenditure should be kept up over the 
forecast horizon. Corporate cash flow continues to 
develop strongly and the hike in both capacity 

utilization and expected demand should bode well for 
continued growth. Public investment, on the other 
hand, is forecast to remain a drag on growth, in an 

effort by the authorities toslowly consolidate the 
general government™s balance sheet.  
Overall, prospects are for a fairly broad-based 
recovery. Quarterly growthrates are projected to 

remain relatively firm, at around 2.4% in annualised 
terms, over the forecast horizon. These quarterly rates 
translate into 3.4% on an annual basis in 2004 (helped 

by a sizeable overhang) and 2.3% in 2005. 
The labour market responds with a lag 
The labour market has been slow in responding to the 
upturn but is now gradually firming. Employment has 
risen only marginally up to now, but the strong rise in 
new job offers should translate into job creation in the 
coming months. Unemployment fell by half a 

percentage point over 2003 and stood at 5.0% of the 
labour force this February. Wages have stabilised 
from their previous decline,but the widely expected 
rise in end-of-year bonuses failed to materialise. 
Deflation is petering out  
Deflationary pressures are slowly abating as the 
economy  continues  to  expand.  The fall  in core CPI

February 2004, albeit helped by some one-off factors 

such as tax hikes. If the recovery continues at the 
projected pace, underlying deflation could come to an 
end in the course of this year.  
Government debt continues to rise 
The general government deficit is estimated to have 
stood at -7.7% of GDP in 2003 and the consolidated 
debt to have approached 160% of GDP. A moderate 
fiscal tightening is projected for the forecast years, in 
line with the authorities™ intention. Despite the 
mounting debt, any confidence crisis has been 
contained by the fact that 60% of government bonds 
are held by public institutions and less than 5% by 
foreigners.  
Risks to the forecast 
The risks to the forecast are balanced. On the upside, 
recent indicators increasingly suggest that the 
recovery is broadening resolutely. If this trend 

continues, domestic demand might respond in a more 
robust way than what has been incorporated in the 
forecast. On the downside, any faltering of the strong 

dynamism in China or the growth momentum in the 
US is likely to have an impact on the Japanese growth 
scenario. A further significant strengthening of the 

yen may also pose a risk to the forecast, even if the 
sensitivity of Japanese exports to an appreciation of 
the yen versus the US dollar has declined over the 
past decade as manufacturing capacity increasingly 
has moved overseas.
