FOREWORD
10ECBAnnualReport
2004When looking back at the events of last year,the enlargement of the EU which took place on
1 May 2004 stands out as a major historical
achievement. We had prepared for this
enlargement well in advance in our areas ofcompetence, in particular by involving ourfellow governors of the central banks of the ten
new Member States as early as possible, as
observers in the General Council meetings; the
success of this enlargement also resulted from
the intense preparatory work carried out by theECB and its staff. In addition, we opened up thecommittees of the European System of Central
Banks (ESCB) to experts from those central
banks, who also participated as observers. The
thorough and friendly nature of this preparation
permitted the smooth entry of these countriesand central banks into the EU and the ESCB.The first General Council meeting held afterenlargement was a moving occasion for all of
us, while the first teleconference of the General
Council also marked a significant milestone:
we were able to assure ourselves of the perfect
functioning of our new, secure communicationnetwork and to demonstrate our capacity toengage in effective discussion through
teleconferencing right across Europe.The ten new Member States have joined the EUwithout an ﬁopt-outﬂ clause. They have thusmade a commitment to ultimately join the euroarea. We are all in agreement that, in full
conformity with the Treaty requirements, the
best possible preparation for adopting the euro,
namely a high level of sustainable convergence
in accordance with the Maastricht criteria, is ofthe essence.During 2004 three more currencies, those ofEstonia, Lithuania and Slovenia, entered the
exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which
was previously composed of its anchor, the
euro, and the Danish krone. The three newentrants are committed to participating inERM II in such a way as to ensure both the
smooth functioning of the system and the best
possible contribution to the achievement of
sustainable convergence.***The members of the EU are on their way to
ratifying the newly signed Treaty establishing
a Constitution for Europe. The Constitution is a
powerful illustration of the will of Europe toproceed with the historical deepening of theUnion alongside its enlargement. The
Eurosystem, which has as its primary objective
the responsibility to deliver price stability, is
fully conscious of its role, confirmed by the
Constitution, in the deepening of the EU. TheConstitution also confirms all the essentialelements of the policy framework for EMU,11ECBAnnualReport
2004under both the monetary pillar and theeconomic and fiscal pillar. The ECB looks
forward to the ratification of the Constitution.***2004 was a year of moderate growth in the euro
area, with real GDP growth for the year as a
whole standing at 1.8% compared with 0.5% in
2003. The growth profile of the year was
marked by a relatively dynamic first halffollowed by slow growth in the third and fourthquarters. Overall, the diagnosis of a gradual
recovery taking place in the context of a
number of domestic and international
uncertainties has been confirmed.The Governing Council of the ECB maintainedthe main refinancing rate at the exceptionally
low level of 2% throughout 2004. It pursued
a monetary policy which aimed to preserve
price stability in a complex international
environment marked, in particular, by
commodity and oil price increases, episodesof volatility in the exchange markets, thepersistence of significant global imbalances
and the significant contribution to global
growth arising from the very rapid
development of a number of emerging
economies. Throughout the year one of theGoverning Council™s main messages was ofvigilance in respect of the inflationary risks
associated with the possible ﬁsecond-round
effectsﬂ of wage and price increases following
the headline inflation humps which resulted, in
particular, from the commodity and oil priceshocks. Not least because economic agents andsocial partners have understood our message
clearly, second-round effects remain subdued.During the first half of 2004 we observed someupward tendency in the medium and long-termestimates of inflation expectations extractedfrom various surveys and from indexed bonds.This adverse trend stopped around the middle
of 2004 and started to reverse during the second
half of the year. The Governing Council™s firm
expression of its vigilance during this period
certainly contributed to preserving the overallanchoring of inflation expectations at a level inline with our definition of price stability: below
2% and close to 2%.This anchoring of medium and long-terminflation expectations in the euro area, whichreflects the credibility of the GoverningCouncil of the ECB, is essential. It is this
credibility which allows the ECB to deliver
price stability, in line with the mandate
assigned to it by the Treaty, even when
circumstances are difficult, by providingeconomic agents with a clear reference in theprice and wage-setting process. It also allows
the euro area to benefit from a financial
environment that is favourable to growth and
job creation, through historically low medium
and long-term market interest rates, which
incorporate inflation expectations in line withour definition of price stability.***A good monetary policy is a necessarycondition for sustainable growth and jobcreation. However, it is not sufficient on itsown. It must be accompanied by a sound fiscal
policy and an appropriate set of structural
reforms.This is why the Eurosystem has always arguedso firmly in favour of the correctimplementation of the Stability and Growth
Pact, and has consistently emphasised the need
to fully preserve the integrity of the corrective
arm of the Pact, in particular the nominal
anchor of 3% of GDP as the limit for fiscaldeficits, as well as of the excessive deficitprocedure itself.12ECBAnnualReport
2004It is also the reason why the Eurosystem hascalled so strongly for the euro area to embark
resolutely on implementing structural reforms
in labour markets, in education and training, in
research and development, in goods andservices markets as well as in the managementof social security spending. These reforms are
of the utmost importance in order to raise
the growth potential of the European economy,
to foster job creation and to reduce
unemployment significantly. Throughout 2004the ECB supported the initiatives of theEuropean Commission and the EU Council
aimed at reviving and speeding up the
implementation of the structural reforms
embodied by the Lisbon agenda. We also
welcomed the proposals included in the reportby the high-level group chaired by Wim Kok,published at the end of 2004, to focus the
Lisbon agenda on a limited number of priority
areas that support higher growth and
employment.***Turning to the organisation and functioning of
the ECB, 2004 was a challenging year for
the institution. The ECB made a net loss of
1,636 million, compared with a net loss of477 million in 2003. This net loss was againdue to the development of exchange rates
which affected the value, in euro terms, of the
ECB™s holdings denominated in foreign
currency. Our accounting principles are based
on maximum prudence. For this reason, these
unrealised exchange rate losses are treated asrealised and taken to the profit and loss accountat the year-end: in 2004 the appreciation of the
euro resulted in net exchange rate revaluation
losses of almost 2.1 billion. By contrast,unrealised gains from exchange rate and
market price revaluations are not recognised asprofit, but transferred directly to revaluationaccounts.The ECB™s regular income is derived primarily
from investment earnings on its holdings of
foreign reserve assets and its paid-up capital of
4.1 billion and from interest income on its 8%share of the euro banknotes in circulation.Interest income in 2004 was again low, due inparticular to the exceptionally low level of
interest rates, the main refinancing rate having
been maintained at 2% throughout 2004.
The ECB earned total net interest income of
690 million, compared with 715 millionin 2003. The ECB™s administrative expenses
on salaries and related costs, rental of
premises, and goods and services amounted to
340 million. At the end of 2004 the ECBemployed 1,314 members of staff, compared
with 1,217 one year earlier.Last year saw the completion of the ECB inMotion project, which aimed to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of the ECB, to
enhance the management of human resources
and to reinforce central banking values among
all staff. Most of the measures contained in theprogramme and approved by the ExecutiveBoard have already been completed and a few
are still being implemented. ECB in Motion has
been a remarkable programme which has
helped to improve our working culture and to
consolidate team spirit within the Bank. TheExecutive Board is fully committed to theimplementation of the programme and to the
preservation of the spirit of ECB in Motion.2004 was marked by two other importantdevelopments. First, the adoption of the ECBcore values: competence, effectiveness andefficiency, integrity, team spirit, transparency
and accountability, and working for Europe.
The second major development was the
decision to embark on a zero-based budgeting
exercise. From its creation on 1 June 1998, theECB has grown quickly in order to successfullymeet the historical challenges it was faced13ECBAnnualReport
2004Frankfurt am Main, March 2005Jean-Claude Trichetwith; having proved its effectiveness, theECB felt that it was time to thoroughly
review the efficiency of its functioning.
The Executive Board thus launched in 2004
a zero-based budgeting exercise aimed atexamining all the tasks of the institution andthe related allocation of staff. The project is in
progress and will be completed by mid-2005.***The Executive Board, the Governing Council
and the General Council of the ECB are
inspired by an exceptional team spirit. In the
euro area, the ECB and the 12 national central
banks make up a single team, the Eurosystem.
2004 saw the creation of the ﬁEurosystemMission Statementﬂ (included in Box 15 ofthis Annual Report), a single statement for
13 institutions and their staff throughout the
euro area. This statement offers a striking
illustration of our collective will to reinforce
further our Eurosystem team in the service of
Europe and of its single currency. The ECB isproud to be at the forefront of this unique team.Artist

CHAPTER  1ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS ANDMONETARY POLICY
16ECBAnnualReport
2004The recovery in economic activity in the euroarea, which started in the second half of 2003,
continued in 2004. The euro area economy
strengthened in the first half of the year,
benefiting from strong global economicgrowth. In the second half of 2004 economicactivity in the euro area weakened somewhat,
partly on account of rising oil prices. Overall,
real GDP grew Œ on a working day-adjusted
basis Œ by 1.8% in 2004, up from 0.5% in 2003
and 0.9% in 2002.Against this background of gradual economicrecovery, underlying domestic inflationary
pressures remained contained, benefiting
significantly from subdued increases in
labour compensation. The slight appreciationof the euro in nominal effective terms alsocontributed to somewhat lower inflationary
pressures. Headline inflation rates in 2004
were, however, significantly affected by
increases in administered prices and indirect
taxes, and, particularly in the second half of the
year, by rises in oil prices. Overall, therefore,IMONETARY POLICY DECISIONS
annual HICP inflation in 2004 was 2.1% Œ
unchanged from the previous year.In this environment of subdued domestic pricepressure and a positive outlook for pricestability over the medium term, the GoverningCouncil of the ECB kept the key ECB interest
rates unchanged throughout 2004, at historically
low levels. The minimum bid rate on the ECB™s
main refinancing operations was kept at 2%,
while the rates on the deposit facility and themarginal lending facility were maintained at 1%and 3% respectively (see Chart 1).Looking at monetary policy decisions in moredetail, data in the first months of 2004
confirmed a continuation of the gradualeconomic recovery that had started in thesecond half of 2003. On the external side,
export growth was buoyant, aided by the strong
dynamics of the world economy. In addition,

2004sheet adjustments, provided a positive picturefor investment. With regard to private
consumption, a gradual recovery was expected
on the basis of an anticipated increase in real
disposable income and a gradual improvementin labour market conditions. Regarding prices,HICP inflation declined to below 2% in early
2004, largely owing to easing inflationary
pressures resulting from the appreciation of the
euro in the last few months of 2003 and from
the base effects stemming from the strongincreases in energy prices in early 2003.Annual M3 growth in the first quarter of 2004continued the downward trend that began in the
summer of 2003. This mainly reflected the
unwinding of earlier portfolio movements, asinvestors gradually shifted the structure of theirportfolios towards longer-term and riskier
financial assets outside M3, following a period
of exceptional preference for liquidity
associated with the heightened economic and
financial uncertainty observed between 2001
and mid-2003. Notwithstanding the normalisationobserved in M3 growth, significantly moreliquidity remained in the euro area than was
needed to finance non-inflationary economic
growth. While this implied that upside risks to
price stability had to be carefully monitored, on
balance, the Governing Council assessed theoutlook for price stability as being favourable inthe first quarter of 2004.Economic developments in the second quarterof 2004 suggested two possible opposing
scenarios. On the one hand, the data availablepointed to continued robust growth in the globaleconomy and a very favourable picture for
euro area exports. On the other hand, oil prices
started to increase markedly after March 2004,
gradually posing stronger downside risks to the
ongoing recovery. Overall, as the second quarterproceeded, the former scenario prevailed andeconomic indicators increasingly confirmed that
the recovery was gaining momentum. Indeed, by
the end of the second quarter, data releases
indicated that the economic recovery seen in the
euro area in the first half of 2004 had been morepronounced than previously expected, thusnurturing optimism about the outlook foreconomic growth. Real GDP grew, on average,
by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the first half of the
year, the highest rate recorded in the euro area
since the first half of 2000. The momentum of therecovery mainly reflected stronger exports and,following a long period of stagnation, an initial
strengthening of private consumption. Against
this background, the June 2004 Eurosystem staff
projections saw euro area real GDP growth
increasing to between 1.4% and 2.0% on averagein 2004 and rising to between 1.7% and 2.7% in2005. Forecasts by international and private
organisations were also in line with expectations
of a strengthening economic upswing in the
second half of 2004.The surge in oil prices exerted considerableshort-term upward pressures on consumer prices
and had a sizeable effect on inflation. Annual
HICP inflation rates rose again in the second
quarter of 2004, partly as a result of rises
in administered prices and indirect taxes.
However, when assessing price trends over themedium term, the Governing Council took theview that inflationary pressures were likely to
remain contained, particularly given the
subdued labour market conditions and the
expectation that wage increases would remain
moderate in the context of only graduallyimproving labour markets and the gradual paceof the economic recovery. These views were in
line with the June 2004 Eurosystem staff
projections, which put average annual HICP
inflation at between 1.9% and 2.3% in 2004 and
between 1.1% and 2.3% in 2005, and consistentwith forecasts by international and privateorganisations. However, some upside risks to
these projections, stemming from oil price
developments, uncertainty surrounding changes
in indirect taxes and administered prices, and
potential second-round effects via wage andprice-setting behaviour, were identified. Inaddition, medium to longer-term inflation
expectations in financial markets increased
somewhat in this period.The annual growth rate of M3 broadlycontinued its downward trend in the second18ECBAnnualReport
2004quarter of 2004, reflecting a furthernormalisation of the portfolio behaviour
of holders of money. Nonetheless, this
normalisation process proceeded rather
slowly and M3 growth remained relativelyhigh, due also to the stimulative effect oflow interest rates on demand for liquid assets.
The Governing Council therefore remained
concerned about the persistently high excess
liquidity in the euro area, which, in an
economic upswing, could lead to inflationarypressures over the medium term.While the main scenario of an ongoingrecovery did not fundamentally change over
the second half of 2004, it became increasingly
apparent that the recovery in euro area activitywould proceed at a somewhat more moderatepace than anticipated. This development
stemmed mainly from a temporary deceleration
in world economic growth, a further substantial
increase in oil prices in the third quarter and a
marked appreciation of the euro in the fourth
quarter. Indeed, in the course of the second halfof the year, data confirmed that the impact ofhigher oil prices had continued to unfold,
dampening the growth in demand both inside
and outside the euro area. Real GDP growth in
the euro area was only 0.2% quarter on quarter
in the third and fourth quarters of 2004.The Eurosystem staff projections published inDecember 2004 pointed to real GDP growth of
between 1.4% and 2.4% in 2005 and between
1.7% and 2.7% in 2006. In addition, the
Governing Council stressed that there were
downside risks to these projections, linked topotential unfavourable developments in the oilmarket.With respect to price developments, over thesecond half of 2004 annual HICP inflation rates
continued to hover somewhat above 2%,mainly as a result of rising oil prices. However,there were no indications of stronger domestic
inflationary pressures building up. Wage
increases had remained subdued since the last
quarter of 2003, a trend that was expected to
continue in the context of ongoing moderategrowth and continued labour market weakness.Against this background, the Eurosystem 
staffprojections published in December 2004 put the
annual HICP increase at between 1.5% and
2.5% in 2005 and between 1.0% and 2.2% in
2006. However, the balance of risks to theseprojections remained tilted to the upside. Risksrelated mainly to developments in oil prices,
uncertainty about further increases in indirect
taxes and administered prices, and potential
second-round effects in wage and price-setting
behaviour.Such risks were also increasingly signalled bythe ECB™s monetary analysis. In the second
half of 2004 the upward impact on M3 growth
Œ particularly its more liquid components Œ
from continued low interest rates came topredominate over the gradual downwardimpact stemming from the normalisation of
portfolio behaviour. Low interest rates also
further fuelled private sector demand for
credit. In particular, demand for loans for house
purchase increased from already robust levels,
contributing to the strong house price dynamicsin several euro area countries. In this context,the Governing Council noted that persistently
high excess liquidity and strong credit growth
were regarded not only as upside risks to
price stability but also as a possible source
of unsustainable asset price increases,particularly in property markets. In early 2005this picture did not fundamentally change. The
strong monetary growth seen since mid-2004
continued and significantly more liquidity
remained in the euro area than was needed to
finance non-inflationary growth.Overall, in the second half of 2004 and early2005, the Governing Council expressed
increasing concern about adverse short-term
inflation developments. At the same time, it
noted that there were no indications thatdomestic inflationary pressures were buildingup. Against this background, the key ECB
interest rates were kept unchanged throughout
this period. However, the Governing Council
stressed that a number of upside risks to price
stability over the medium term requiredcontinued vigilance.19ECBAnnualReport
20042.1THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC
ENVIRONMENT
WORLD ECONOMY REGISTERED STRONGEST
GROWTH IN OVER TWO DECADES
In 2004 the global economy expanded at its
fastest rate since 1976, with growth being
relatively broad-based across the various
regions (see Chart 2). Growth in the Asian region
was particularly robust, with the Chinese
economy showing signs of overheating. Strongglobal economic growth was supported byfavourable financing conditions and stimulative
macroeconomic policies in many countries. It
was accompanied by a robust expansion of world
trade, which, in 2004, reached its highest level
since 2000.The expansion of the global economy wasespecially strong in the early months of the
year, decelerating thereafter in most countries.
This slowdown partly reflected a normalisation
of the strong dynamics observed in the
preceding quarters, and the beginning of agradual withdrawal of policy stimuli. Thesignificant increase in oil prices, which
reached a peak in October 2004, exerted an
additional dampening influence. The rise in oil
prices contributed to a moderate increase in
inflation rates in many countries, largely as aresult of developments in energy-relatedprice components. Underlying inflation trends
remained relatively stable, however, suggesting
that second-round effects were fairly well-
contained (see Chart 2).Continued robust growth in the United States(compared with some of its trading partners)
contributed to a further widening of the US
current account deficit. This, together with  the
uncertainties surrounding the country™s fiscal
policy outlook, rekindled market concernsabout the sustainability of global imbalances.Partly reflecting these concerns, the US
dollar experienced a relatively broad-based
depreciation in the last months of the year.In the United States, economic growthcontinued at a generally brisk pace in 2004,2MONETARY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTSwith real GDP increasing by 4.4% for theyear as a whole (according to preliminary
estimates). This expansion also broadenedfurther to encompass the long-awaitedimprovement in the labour market. Growth in
real GDP was supported by continued strength
in household consumption and business
investment (particularly on equipment and
software), while net trade made a negativecontribution to growth.Chart 2 Main developments in majorindustrialised economiesSources: National data, BIS, Eurostat and ECB calculations.1) Eurostat data are used for the euro area; for the United

2004Private consumption growth remained solid formost of the year, reflecting the continued
effects of accommodative macroeconomic
policies, a strong rise in residential house
prices and a significant improvement in payrollemployment. Although employment growthpicked up after several years of weakness,
upward pressures on wages remained generally
contained owing mostly to remaining slack in
the labour market. Subdued growth in labour
costs, combined with high oil prices,contributed to restraining underlying growth inreal disposable income in the second half of
2004. In the absence of a one-off boost to
income coming from an extraordinary large
dividend payment in December, this would
have pushed down the personal saving rate stillfurther. At the same time, household debt roseto a historically high level as a proportion of
disposable income in 2004.Business investment grew vigorously in 2004,led by increased investment in equipment and
software, in an environment of favourablefinancing conditions, temporary fiscalincentives and low levels of inventories
accompanied by strong demand. Although
higher oil prices contributed to an increase
in the cost of raw materials, corporate
profitability remained strong. Partly reflectingthe improvement in the labour market,productivity growth declined during 2004,
although it still remained relatively strong for
the year as a whole.The external balance of the United Statescontinued to deteriorate in 2004, with the UStrade and current account deficit rising to
historically high levels as a proportion of GDP.
In real terms, growth in imports continued to
outpace that of exports despite the cumulative
depreciation of the US dollar since early2002, as strong domestic demand in the UnitedStates significantly outpaced that of major
trading partners. The related domestic saving/
investment imbalance reflected continued
public sector dissaving and a historically low
personal saving rate.Consumer price inflation rebounded in 2004,
largely in response to higher energy prices,
with annual CPI growth standing at 3.3% at the
end of the year. Inflation excluding food and
energy also reversed its downward trend ofthe last few years, rising to 2.2%. Upwardprice pressures, however, remained relatively
moderate owing to a gradual absorption of
labour market slack, continued strong
productivity growth and only a limited pass-
through of the depreciation of the US dollarinto consumer prices. Accordingly, survey-based and market measures of longer-term
inflation expectations remained contained,
despite a moderate rise in the latter.Following a period of historically low interestrates, the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) of the Federal Reserve System
increased the federal funds rate target by
125 basis points in 2004. This increase was
carried out in five successive 25 basis point
steps beginning in June 2004, which brought
the target for the federal funds rate to 2.25% bythe end of the year (in early February 2005 itreached 2.5%). While the FOMC noted that
policy accommodation could be removed at a
pace that was likely to be measured, it
underlined that it would respond to changes in
economic prospects as and when needed inorder to fulfil its obligation to maintain pricestability. With respect to fiscal policy, the
federal government budget deficit worsened to
3.6% of GDP in the fiscal year 2004, despite the
pick-up in economic activity.In Japan, the economic recovery lostmomentum in the course of 2004. Following a
strong expansion in the first quarter of the year,
economic activity significantly decelerated
throughout the rest of 2004. This deceleration
in economic activity particularly reflectedlower public spending and weakening privatedomestic demand, as well as a moderation in
the dynamics of exports. Nevertheless, as a
result of base effects and the strong first
quarter, in 2004 annual real GDP growth rose
to its highest rate since 1996 (2.6%). Somegradual improvements were observed in labour21ECBAnnualReport
2004market conditions. Meanwhile, the restructuringof corporate balance sheets, together with cost-
cutting efforts, contributed to a strong rebound
in corporate profit growth, while the banking
sector reduced the level of outstanding non-performing loans.Concerns about deflation eased somewhatduring the year, but did not fully dissipate.
Corporate goods prices increased, mainly
reflecting increases in raw material prices, whilefinal goods prices continued to declinemoderately. The annual rate of change in
consumer prices for the year as a whole stood at
0%, compared with -0.3% in 2003. In October
signs of abating deflationary pressures led some
Bank of Japan Policy Board members to predicta slight increase in the CPI excluding fresh foodin the fiscal year 2005. However, deflationary
pressures re-emerged towards the end of 2004 as
a result of the decline in prices of liberalised
utility services. The Bank of Japan raised the
target range for the outstanding balance on
current accounts held with it to JPY 30-35trillion in January 2004. The monetary policystance remained unchanged during the
remainder of the year.Sustaining strong momentum from the previousyear, the non-Japan Asian economies registeredanother very robust year of growth in 2004,benefiting particularly from strong external
demand, reviving domestic demand and China™s
investment boom. Regional integration in Asia
strengthened, as indicated by the rapid growth
in intra-regional trade and investment flows.Nevertheless, the growth momentum easedtowards the end of 2004 amid moderating
external demand and high oil prices. At the
country level, the Chinese economy continued
to grow strongly, with some signs of overheating
in the first half of the year. Policy measuresslowed investment momentum in the second halfof the year, but did not dampen overall economic
activity. In the year as a whole, Chinese GDP
grew by 9.5%.In Latin America, the economic situationshowed a considerable improvement, supportedby both export activity and domestic demand.Growth in Brazil and Mexico gained
momentum over the course of the year,
mainly sustained by robust exports and the
strengthening of investment activity. InArgentina, the recovery of economic activityremained strong, although it moderated
somewhat in the course of the year.COMMODITY PRICES ROSE STRONGLY IN 2004
Oil prices increased throughout most of theyear amid considerable volatility. The priceof Brent crude oil reached a peak of
USD 51 at the end of October, compared with
USD 30 at the beginning of the year (see
Chart 3). For the whole of 2004, the average
price of Brent crude oil was USD 38, 33%above the average of 2003. If measured in termsof euro, the price of Brent crude oil increased
by 20% over the same period. The main factors
behind the surge in oil prices in 2004 were the
strength of global demand for oil, security
concerns about oil supplies and a supply and
demand mismatch for different qualities of oil.Demand for oil soared, particularly in Asia andNorth America, and continued to exceed
expectations throughout 2004 in a context of
robust global economic growth. According to
the International Energy Agency, the globaldemand for oil increased by 3.4% in 2004,its highest rate of growth in almost three
decades.Turning to supply conditions, in early 2004market participants expected Œ in response tostatements by the Organisation of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) Œ that cuts in
OPEC production were imminent, even though
they did not subsequently materialise. Instead,
both OPEC and non-OPEC producers increased
crude oil production significantly in 2004. Asthe global supply of oil increased, spareproduction and refining capacity shrank
considerably, leaving only a very limited
margin for unexpected oil supply disruptions.
As a result, oil prices in 2004 became very
sensitive to unanticipated changes in thesupply/demand balance, to market perceptions22ECBAnnualReport
2004about the security of crude oil supplies and toconcerns over the adequacy of oil inventories.
In addition, rapidly rising demand for final oilproducts and growing supplies of crude oilled to a quality mismatch, resulting in record
high premiums for high-quality crudes such as
Brent.The prices of non-energy commodities, whichhad been buoyant since the second half of 2003,peaked in the first half of 2004 (see Chart 3)
owing to the strong global economic recovery.
Overall non-energy commodity prices eased
somewhat in the second half of 2004, as the
prices of both food and agricultural rawmaterials fell from the peaks reached earlier inthe year. The prices of metals, however,
continued to rise. In US dollar terms, overall
non-energy commodity prices were, on
average, 22% higher in 2004 than a year earlier.2.2MONETARY AND FINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTSM3 GROWTH INFLUENCED BY TWO OPPOSING

FORCESAgainst the background of the monetary policy
stance and capital market developments,
monetary dynamics in 2004 were influenced by
two opposing forces: on the one hand, the low
level of interest rates and, on the other hand, the
normalisation of portfolio allocation behaviourof euro area residents following their strongpreference for liquidity between 2001 and
mid-2003. In the first half of 2004 the
moderating impact on M3 growth of the
normalisation of portfolio allocation behaviour
dominated and the annual growth rate of M3continued the slowdown that had started in thesummer of 2003, declining to 5.3% in June 2004.
The annual growth rate of M3 strengthened
again in the second half of 2004, standing at
6.4% at the end of the year, as the stimulative
impact of the low level of interest rates and the
resulting low opportunity costs of holdingmoney came to the fore, reinforced by arenewed decline in long-term interest rates. At
the same time, monetary dynamics in 2004 also
reflected the fact that output growth was
stronger than in the previous year.The normalisation of portfolio allocationbehaviour seen in 2004 proceeded only slowly.
Although the exceptional economic and
financial market uncertainty of previous
years diminished, the risk aversion of, inter
alia, euro area households appeared to remainpronounced after a prolonged period of capitallosses in stock markets between 2000 and
mid-2003. This may explain the liquidity
preference among investors, which was greater
than would be considered normal for this stage
of the economic cycle. Moreover, thestimulative impact of the low level of interestrates on money holdings may be particularly
strong when interest rates are very low. This
could be due to the existence of transaction
costs that are associated with shifts out of
liquid assets and would further lower theopportunity costs of holding such assets.Chart 3 Main developments incommodity marketsSources: Bloomberg and HWWA.

2004The increasing dominance of the low level ofinterest rates in driving M3 dynamics can be
illustrated with the help of a measure of M3
which is corrected for the estimated impact of
portfolio shifts into M31 during the periodof exceptional financial market uncertainty
between 2001 and mid-2003. By construction,
this measure is also unaffected by the
subsequent normalisation of portfolio allocation
behaviour and should thus provide clearer
indications of the effect of interest rates thanthe official M3 series. It should be stressed thatthe estimate of M3 corrected for the impact of
portfolio shifts is surrounded by a considerable
degree of uncertainty and should therefore be
interpreted with caution. Over the last three
quarters of 2004 the official M3 growth ratewas below the annual growth rate of thecorrected M3 series, suggesting that the
normalisation of portfolio allocation behaviour
had a moderating impact. However, the fact
that both the growth rate of the official M3
series and that of the corrected M3 seriesstrengthened in the second half of 2004 mayChart 5 Contributions to annual M3growth(in percentage points; M3 growth in percentages; adjusted forseasonal and calendar effects)Source: ECB.

the normalisation of portfolio allocation
behaviour, was the main driving force behind
M3 dynamics (see Chart 4).As had been the case in 2003, the maincontribution to annual M3 growth in 2004 came
from the most liquid components, i.e. those
contained in the narrow monetary aggregate
M1 (see Chart 5). That contribution was a resultof substantial increases in the holdings of bothcurrency in circulation and overnight deposits.
The growth of currency in circulation reflected
the continued strong demand for euro
banknotes both inside and outside the euro area
(see also Section 3 of Chapter 2 on banknotesand coins).1For further details, see Section 4 of the article entitled
ﬁMonetary analysis in real timeﬂ in the October 2004 issue of
the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
24ECBAnnualReport
2004The growth rate of overnight deposits remainedrather high in 2004, supported by the very low
opportunity costs of holding these deposits.
The average interest rates on overnight
deposits of households and non-financialcorporations remained broadly unchangedcompared with end-2003, at levels of 0.73%
and 0.90% respectively at the end of 2004(see Chart 6). This mirrored developments
in money market rates in 2004.The contribution to annual M3 growth of short-term deposits other than overnight deposits was
around 1.1 percentage points in 2004,
considerably lower than in 2003. This lower
contribution mainly reflected developments in
short-term time deposits (i.e. deposits with anagreed maturity of up to and including twoyears), the annual growth rate of which was
negative, while short-term savings deposits
(i.e. deposits redeemable at notice of up to and
including three months) grew strongly. The
different developments in these two sub-
components may reflect the fact that the typicalremuneration advantage of time deposits up toone year over savings deposits did not exist in
2004 (see Chart 6). In such a situation, short-
term savings deposits are relatively attractive,
as they possess a higher degree of liquidity.Finally, the contribution of marketableinstruments to the annual growth rate of M3
diminished to 0.4 percentage point in 2004,
from 1.2 percentage points in the previous year.
This reflected in particular a strong decline in
the annual growth rate of money market fundshares/units. These assets are often held byhouseholds and firms as a safe savings vehicle
in times of economic and financial uncertainty,Chart 6 Short-term MFI interest rateson deposits(percentages per annum; rates on new business;weight-adjusted1))Source: ECB.

2004Box 1TRENDS IN THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT OF THE EURO AREA NON-FINANCIAL SECTOR IN 2004
The annual growth rate of the financial investment of the non-financial sector in the first threequarters of 2004 was broadly unchanged compared with the average rate of growth in 2003 (see
table). This stability masked somewhat heterogeneous developments in the various categories
of financial investment. While there was a pick-up between 2003 and 2004 in the rate of growth
of investment in long-term debt securities and quoted shares, the growth rate of investment inmoney market fund shares/units declined significantly. Moreover, while investment in equityand equity-linked funds grew at a faster rate in 2004 than in previous years, purchases of
bonds and bond-linked funds slowed somewhat. Overall, these developments provide further
confirmation of a gradual normalisation of the portfolio allocation behaviour of euro area
residents as agents™ propensity to invest in riskier and longer-term assets recovered.Households continued to invest a large percentage of their financial savings in insurancereserves, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in 2003. The high degree of interest in these
products has been sustained over several years. It probably reflects precautionary savings for
retirement in an ageing society and possibly also agents™ concerns regarding public pension
schemes.Outstanding amountAnnual growth ratesas a percentage19992000

2004MORE BROADLY BASED GROWTH OF MFI CREDIT
TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR
Developments in the counterparts of M3
confirmed the influence of the two opposing
forces on monetary dynamics mentionedpreviously. On the one hand, stronger growth inMFI longer-term financial liabilities and, in the
first half of the year, lower increases in net
external assets reflected the unwinding of past
portfolio shifts into M3. On the other hand,
stronger growth in MFI loans to the privatesector reflected the prevailing low level ofinterest rates.In the first half of 2004 capital outflows fromthe euro area remained robust, whereas weaker
capital inflows led to a decline in the annualflow of the net external assets of the euro areaMFI sector (see Chart 7). Such capital outflows
were the result of euro area residents
purchasing assets from non-euro area residents
Œ one aspect of the normalisation of portfolio
allocation behaviour by euro area residents. To
the extent that such transactions are settledthrough the euro area MFI sector, the netexternal assets of the MFI sector and the
deposits of euro area residents decrease. The
first half of 2004 also saw a sustained
expansion in MFI longer-term financial
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves),which was consistent with the ongoingnormalisation of portfolio allocation
behaviour, as funds were shifted from liquid
monetary assets into longer maturity
instruments. These developments in net
external assets and longer-term financialliabilities were essentially a continuation oftrends observed in the second half of 2003.
However, already in the first half of 2004 the
dampening effect of these factors on M3
growth was partly offset by the robust growth
in MFI credit to euro area residents inan environment characterised by low levelsof interest rates and improved economic
conditions.In the second half of 2004 the continuedstrengthening of growth in MFI credit to theprivate sector made that counterpart thedominant factor driving M3 dynamics.Moreover, the dynamism of MFI loans to the
private sector became more broadly based
across the main non-financial sectors. Upward
pressure on M3 dynamics was also associated
with the reversal of the previous downwardtrend in the annual flow of net external assets, areversal which resulted from capital inflows
caused by a renewed interest in euro area equity
and bonds on the part of non-euro area residents
as well as expectations of a further appreciation
of the euro exchange rate. The averagecontribution of net external assets to annual M3growth increased from 1.1 percentage points in
the second quarter of 2004 to 2.2 percentage
points in the fourth quarter. At the same time,
the growth in MFI longer-term financial
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves)strengthened further, pointing to an ongoingnormalisation of portfolio allocation behaviour
by euro area residents in favour of non-
monetary assets.Chart 7 Movements in M3 and itscounterparts(annual flows; end of period; EUR billions; adjusted forseasonal and calendar effects)Source: ECB.

2004LIQUIDITY REMAINED AMPLE
The strength of M3 dynamics over the course of2004 implied a further increase in available
measures of excess liquidity, which denotes theliquidity available in the euro area that exceedsthe amount needed to finance non-inflationary
growth (see Chart 8). The first of these
measures is the nominal money gap, which is
defined as the difference between the actual
level of M3 and the level of M3 that would haveresulted from constant M3 growth at itsreference value of 4½% taking December 1998
as the base period; the second is the real money
gap, which corrects the nominal money gap for
the excess liquidity that has been absorbed bypast price developments (i.e. the cumulated
deviation of inflation rates from the ECB™s
definition of price stability); and the third is an
alternative measure of the real money gap
which is constructed using an estimate of M3corrected for portfolio shifts.When assessing these measures of excessliquidity, it should be recognised that the
choice of December 1998 as the base period is
arbitrary. The levels of the measures musttherefore be interpreted with caution.Moreover, as noted previously, the estimate of
M3 corrected for portfolio shifts is surrounded
by a considerable degree of uncertainty.2Bearing these caveats in mind, all estimates of
the money gap rose further in the second half of2004, having shown signs of levelling off in thefirst half of the year. The large difference
between the real money gap measure based on
the official M3 series and that based on M3
corrected for the estimated impact of portfolio
shifts indicates that much of the stock of excess
liquidity reflected previous portfolio shiftsinto M3. However, Chart 8 also shows that thecorrected measure has risen significantly since
mid-2003, indicating that excess liquidity in
the euro area has increasingly ceased to be a
reflection only of portfolio shifts.These levels of excess liquidity signal risks tomedium-term price stability. If a significant
part of this excess liquidity were to be
transformed into transaction balances,
particularly at a time when confidence and
economic activity strengthened, this couldcontribute to the emergence of inflationarypressures (see Box 2 entitled ﬁWhat could
happen with the excess liquidity in the euro
area?ﬂ). In addition, ample liquidity and strong
credit growth could become a source of strong
asset price increases, particularly in housingmarkets.Chart 8 Estimates of the money gap1)(as a percentage of the relevant measure of the stock of M3;adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects; December 1998 = 0)Source: ECB.

2004Box 2WHAT COULD HAPPEN WITH THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE EURO AREA?
The strong growth in M3 since mid-2001 has led to a sustained increase in measures of excessliquidity in the euro area, which have reached historical highs. This implies that there was
substantially more liquidity in the euro area in 2004 than needed to finance non-inflationary
economic growth. However, the levels of these measures should be interpreted with caution.When assessing what could happen with the excess liquidity, the factors responsible for itsbuild-up should be borne in mind. Two broad factors can be identified. First, the protracted
period of economic, financial and geopolitical uncertainty between mid-2001 and mid-2003
led to a significantly increased preference during this period for safe and liquid instruments
included in M3. Second, the low level of interest rates across the maturity spectrum and the
associated low opportunity costs of holding liquid assets have added to the demand for money,
particularly over the most recent period. On the basis of these factors, the strong demand for
short-term instruments included in M3 may reflect a mixture of mainly speculative and
precautionary, rather than transaction, motives. Each of these motives may, in turn, imply
different ways in which excess liquidity can be used in the future and, accordingly, different
degrees of risk to price stability (see the chart).One possibility for the use of excess liquidity is for economic agents to invest their liquidholdings in longer-term assets, in equity or debt securities, or in real estate, either directly or
indirectly via investment funds. In order to achieve an aggregate reduction of excess liquidity,
it is necessary for either the resident MFI sector or agents outside the euro area to act as
counterparties in these transactions. This use of excess liquidity would have no direct impact
on HICP inflation, but the readjustment of portfolios may, under certain circumstances, have
an impact on asset prices which, in turn, could have indirect effects on inflation at a later point
in time via wealth effects.Schematic presentation of how excess liquidity may be usedno significant direct

29ECBAnnualReport
2004A second possibility is that the excess liquidity will at some point translate into transactionbalances. This is most likely to be the case at a time when economic confidence is
strengthening. To the extent that these balances are used to increase the demand for domestic
goods and services, this could progressively reabsorb the current margins of idle capacity.
Should strong consumption growth continue for a sufficiently long time, a tightening of
production capacities could eventually cause risks to price stability.Finally, it cannot be entirely ruled out that the current situation of excess liquidity to someextent reflects a permanent change in the money demand behaviour of economic agents, i.e. a
structurally higher liquidity preference and, hence, an increase in the desired level of money
holdings. Such a permanent change could, for example, be due to structurally higher risk
aversion on the part of households as regards financial investments following the significant
losses they incurred on the stock markets between 2000 and 2003. To the extent that such a
factor plays a role, excess liquidity in the euro area would be lower than indicated by the
current measures and would not have an inflationary impact.In reality, the situation is probably a combination of these three possibilities. At the currentjuncture, it is difficult to determine whether or not there has been a permanent rise in liquidity
preferences over recent years. At the same time, a continued strong preference for real estate
purchases could be associated with strong rises in real estate prices. Furthermore, there is some
evidence that economic agents have readjusted their portfolio behaviour by investing more in
longer-term financial assets. Looking ahead, it cannot be ruled out that some of the excess
liquidity will be used for higher nominal transactions, particularly at a time of stronger
economic confidence, and then be associated with higher inflation.Overall, therefore, even if some of the excess liquidity reflects a higher liquidity preference onthe part of households and companies in the euro area, the high levels reached in 2004 remain a
concern for the ECB and call for vigilance. In order to capture the relative empirical
importance of the possible scenarios for the use of excess liquidity and, thereby, the risks to
medium-term price stability, the ECB will continue to monitor closely developments on all
fronts, in particular: a) evidence of portfolio reversals and the risk of emerging asset price
bubbles, b) evidence of stronger than usual consumption and c) evidence of any structural
change in money demand.MONEY MARKET RATES REMAINED BROADLY
STABLE
In 2004 the Governing Council of the ECBdecided to keep its key interest rates
unchanged. As a consequence, money market
rates at the very short end of the yield curve
remained broadly stable throughout the year.Money market interest rates at longer maturitiesdeclined significantly in the first quarter of
2004, continuing the downward trend observed
from mid-December 2003 (see Chart 9).
Towards the end of March 2004, in a contextwhere key ECB interest rates were expected todecline further, the money market yield
curve became negatively sloped. In fact, theslope of this curve, as measured by the
difference between the twelve-month and the
one-month EURIBOR, reached its lowest point
on 26 March 2004, at -7 basis points.However, between April and June 2004 anormalisation of the slope of the yield curve
was observed, with significant increases in
interest rates at longer maturities, while
interest rates remained broadly stable at the
very short end of the curve. Thereafter, longer-term money market interest rates remained30ECBAnnualReport

2.10% and 2.34% respectively.The changes in short-term money marketinterest rates in the course of 2004 were
generally mirrored in the evolution of the
implied three-month EURIBOR futures rate.
The implied volatility derived from options on
three-month EURIBOR futures contractsdeclined substantially throughout the year,indicating that market participants saw verylittle uncertainty in the expected future path of
short-term interest rates (see Chart 10).LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS

DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2004
Long-term government bond yields in the euro
area ended 2004 at very low levels by historical
standards. While in the first half of the year
euro area ten-year government bond yieldsfluctuated somewhat but did not change muchoverall, in the second half of 2004 they
exhibited a protracted downward trend and, by
year-end, had reached 3.7%, significantly
below the levels prevailing at the end of 2003
(see Chart 11).Overall, these movements in euro area long-term bond yields mainly reflected the changing
perceptions of market participants with regard
to inflationary pressures and the outlook for
the euro area economy, perceptions which werein turn closely related to changes in global31ECBAnnualReport

appeared to be influenced by two main factors.
First, there was increasing confidence among
market participants regarding the ongoing
recovery in the euro area, by then alsosupported by better prospects for the worldeconomy. Second, market participants became
increasingly concerned about the potential
inflationary impact of the surge in oil prices
against the background of the ongoing global
economic recovery. Indeed, in the spring long-term bond yields and break-even inflation ratesedged up amid renewed inflationary concerns
on the part of investors (see Chart 12).
However, such concerns were much less
pronounced in the euro area than in the United
States, where bond yields and break-even
inflation rates rose more sharply.Between April and June 2004 marketparticipants™ inflation expectations in the
euro area appeared to increase most over
shorter horizons, while longer-term inflation
expectations, as measured by implied forwardbreak-even inflation rates, appeared to besomewhat more stable, although these
remained at relatively high levels.3 It is likelythat the increase in euro area break-even
inflation rates reflected to some extent a higher
inflation risk premium required by investorsin the light of the uncertainty surroundingthe impact of the oil price developments.
Additional information from survey measures
of euro area inflation expectations, which did
not show an increase in the point estimates
for long-term inflation expectations, wasconsistent with this interpretation.macroeconomic prospects throughout the year.Market participants™ expectations regardingthe impact of the upsurge in oil prices over theyear strongly influenced perceptions regarding
both inflationary pressures and economic
activity. These expectations, however, seemed
to vary over time in line with the flow of
macroeconomic data releases. Indeed,although in the spring market participantsappeared to be mainly concerned about the
inflationary effects of the sharp rise in oil
prices, later in the year concerns appeared to
shift towards the impact of the high level of oil
prices on economic activity.In the first quarter of the year long-term bondyields in the euro area declined, mirroring
movements in the US market, amid growing
concerns about the strength of the economic
recovery in the United States. Despite thegradual strengthening in euro area economicactivity, long-term index-linked bond yields in
the euro area also declined in the first quarter of
the year in line with comparable US yields,
reflecting the fact that market participants™
expectations regarding future global economicactivity appeared to be influenced largely by3Chart 12 shows that, in spring 2004, the rise in the 2012 spot
break-even inflation rate, which reflects, among other things,
average inflation expectations between 2004 and 2012, was

stronger than that in the long-term implied forward break-even

inflation rate, which reflects average inflation expectations

between 2008 and 2014. This suggests a stronger increase in

inflation expectations at shorter horizons.
32ECBAnnualReport
2004Developments in oil prices continued to exert asubstantial influence on bond yields over the
second half of the year. However, markets also
appeared in this period to be increasingly
concerned about the impact of oil prices oneconomic activity in the euro area and theglobal economy. This was reflected in the
gradual decline, observed from mid-June
onwards, in long-term nominal and index-
linked bond yields, suggesting that the markets
expected the pace of economic growth in theeuro area to decline somewhat. A furtherdepreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis the euro,
in particular over the last quarter of 2004, also
seemed to contribute to the moderation in
market participants™ perceptions of the near-
term growth prospects of the euro area. Thedecline in long-term nominal and index-linkedbond yields in the euro area also mirroreddownward revisions to market expectations
regarding the pace of monetary policy
tightening over the near to medium term.As a result of these developments, nominallong-term bond yields in the euro area fell
significantly over 2004, declining by around
60 basis points to end the year at 3.7%, close to
their historical lows. The interest rate
differential vis-à-vis the United Statesremained broadly stable for most of the year,reflecting more or less synchronous changes in
the macroeconomic prospects in the two
economies. However, some decoupling of
long-term bond yield movements occurred
towards the end of 2004, when the interest ratedifferential between US and euro area ten-yeargovernment bond yields widened somewhat,
reaching a level of almost 60 basis points.Break-even inflation rates also moderatedslightly in the second half of 2004.
Nevertheless, long-term break-even inflationrates in the euro area remained at the end of theyear above their average values since late 2001,
when inflation-linked bonds indexed to the
euro area HICP excluding tobacco were first
issued. The ten-year break-even inflation rate
ended the year at around 2.2%, an increase ofmore than 10 basis points compared withDecember 2003.A further decline in implied volatility in thebond market Œ a measure which provides
evidence of market views about the rangeswithin which bond yields are expected to movein the near term Œ was also a noticeable feature
of 2004. Indeed, subsequent movements in
realised volatility confirmed those market
expectations of lower bond market volatility

2004Box 3COMMON TRENDS IN IMPLIED FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY
The year 2004 brought a marked overall decline in implied volatility across several financialmarket segments in the euro area and in other advanced economies. Implied volatility Œ which
is derived from option prices Œ is usually interpreted as a measure of market participants™
uncertainty regarding near-term developments in different financial markets. In 2004 there
was some concern that the relatively low levels of implied volatility might not be fully justifiedinsofar as they may have been driven down by factors other than market participants™expectations of future realised volatility. Such a potential ﬁmis-pricingﬂ of volatility could
constitute, among other things, a risk to financial stability. If financial institutions, for
example, respond to lower volatility by increasing their risk exposure accordingly, they might
incur heavy losses if an upward correction of volatility were to take place. According to
empirical evidence, no such mis-pricing was detected and the decline in implied volatility invarious financial markets was correctly followed by lower realised volatility.1 Lower realisedvolatility, in turn, can be explained, for instance, by an ongoing process of normalisation,especially in the global stock markets, after several years of exceptionally turbulent
developments.Chart A Implied financial market volatility in the euro area(percentages per annum; monthly data)Sources: Bloomberg and ECB calculations.

Since all the options
concerned are from the same day and have roughly the same remaining time to maturity, the
implied volatility series shown in the chart measure market participants™ uncertainty in all
three market segments over a similar short-term horizon.In the past, there seemed to be a rather low degree of co-movement in near-term expectedvolatility in the different market segments, except in occasional periods of cross-market
turmoil that were probably triggered by common rather than market-specific shocks. More
recently, the decline in volatility over the first three quarters of 2004 was quite similar across
markets. In the absence of evidence of mis-priced volatility, this would suggest widespread
and gradually increasing confidence among financial market participants regarding moretranquil market conditions in the near term. Over the last few months of 2004, however, thestrong decline in implied volatility in the USD/EUR exchange rate came to a halt amid a
renewed acceleration of US dollar weakness.Today™s capital markets are highly integrated and one may suspect that the internationalvolatility linkages within each market segment are significant. Chart B below shows the
implied volatility in stock markets in both the United States and the euro area, as measured bythe VIX and the VDAX indices respectively, as well as implied volatility in the corresponding35ECBAnnualReport
2004long-term bond markets, as derived from options on US Treasury and Bund futuresrespectively.It is clear from the chart that there is a high degree of co-movement in implied volatility withinboth asset classes in the United States and in the euro area. Moreover, the international
linkages seem to be somewhat stronger for the equity markets than for the long-term
government bond markets. Still, country and market-specific factors can play a dominant role.The terrorist attacks of 11 March 2004 in Madrid, for instance, had a larger, albeit temporary,impact on expected stock market volatility in the euro area than in the United States. The chart
also provides further evidence that the overall decline in implied volatility over the past few
years has not been restricted to the euro area.All in all, the linkages within certain financial asset classes across geographic areas are quitestrong, particularly for the equity markets. While there is no general tendency for impliedvolatility to move in parallel across market segments in normal circumstances, there seems to
be a stronger connection in times of turbulence. The recent alignment of implied volatility
across the three asset classes is noteworthy since it is not related to any financial turmoil and,
therefore, lends support to the widespread anticipation among market participants of calmer
financial market conditions in the near future than was the case at the beginning of 2004.In early 2005, long-term bond yields in globalmarkets at first continued to decline beforethey sharply rebounded around mid-February
2005. As a result, on 24 February ten-year
government bond yields, both in the euro area
and the United States, stood at levels close to
those prevailing at the end of 2004.EURO AREA STOCK MARKETS CONTINUED TO

SHOW STRONG GAINS IN 2004
In 2004 euro area stock prices continued the
upward trend observed from early 2003 (see
Chart 13). The Dow Jones EURO STOXXindex ended the year with a gain of around 10%compared with the end of the previous year, a
slightly higher increase than the Standard &
Poor™s 500 and the Nikkei 225.These overall stock price increases in the euroarea appeared to reflect several factors, inparticular declines in long-term interest rates
and strong growth in actual earnings and
dividend payouts (see Chart 14).A substantial decline in stock market volatility,which suggested reduced uncertainty amongmarket participants regarding the stock market
outlook, also seemed to contribute positively tothe stock price gains over the year (see also
Box 3). Potentially negative factors, such as
the somewhat less optimistic outlook for
global growth as a result of oil price rises
and Œ particularly towards the end of 2004 Œexchange rate developments, seemed to haveonly an attenuating effect on stock prices.As regards the sectoral breakdown, theincrease in euro area stock prices in 2004 was
broadly based, with only one sector(technology) out of the ten economic sectors ofthe Dow Jones EURO STOXX index recording
lower stock prices at end-2004 than a year
earlier. The strongest gains were recorded in
the healthcare and utility sectors, while the
telecommunication sector recovered in 2004 aswell. The energy sector also outperformed theoverall index, supported by the fact that its
revenues are positively linked to oil price
developments. This factor also contributed to
the performance of the utility sector, as demand
shifts towards alternative energy sources suchas natural gas are common in periods of high oil36ECBAnnualReport

This may reflect investors™ concerns about the
strength of domestic demand, and private
consumption in particular, in the euro area.The upward trend in global stock pricedevelopments continued in the first two months
of 2005. The Dow Jones EURO STOXX index
gained more than 3% between the end of 2004
and 24 February, while the Standard & Poor™s
500 and the Nikkei 225 also rose slightly in thesame period. These price increases seemed tobe mainly supported by further strong
improvements in corporate profitability.STRONG DEMAND FOR HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Demand for financing on the part of thehousehold sector was strong in 2004, asreflected by the fact that the annual average
rate of growth of MFI loans to households rose
to 7.8%. Household loan dynamics in 2004
continued the upward trend observed from the
first quarter of 2002 and were primarily relatedto robust growth in long-term loans. Over thefirst three quarters of 2004 the annual growth
rate of total loans to households was higherthan that of loans by MFIs, pointing to a
continued high rate of growth of loans by other
financial institutions (OFIs) in the context of
the securitisation of residential mortgages in a
number of countries.Long-term MFI loans to households weremostly composed of loans for house purchase.
The strong dynamics of this component
were supported by buoyant house price
developments in several euro area countriesand continued growth in house prices at anannual rate of more than 7% for the euro area as
a whole in the first half of 2004. Available data
suggest that growth in household borrowing
for house purchase remained sluggish in
most countries with subdued house pricedevelopments, while it was strong in countrieswhere house prices were rising rapidly (see
Chart 15). In a number of euro area countries,
developments in house prices and house
financing may also have contributed to
supporting consumption. The increase in houseprices created greater financing requirements37ECBAnnualReport
2004but may also have enhanced the access ofhouseholds to credit by increasing the amount
of collateral available to them. At the same
time, the strong growth in loans for house
purchase may itself have become a source of
increases in house prices.A factor underpinning the strong growth inloans for house purchase was the low cost of
financing for housing loans, which declined
further in 2004 from the already low level
prevailing in previous years. This increased the
affordability of house purchases. MFI interestrates on new loans for house purchase with overfive and under ten years™ initial rate fixation
declined by 52 basis points over the course of
the year and stood at 4.49% in December 2004
(see Chart 16), mirroring developments in
comparable market interest rates for medium-term government bonds. It also appears that theoverall availability of financing for households
improved in 2004. Indeed, the results of the
Eurosystem™s bank lending survey suggest that
there was some easing of credit standards
applied by banks to the approval of loans forhouse purchase in the last three quarters of2004.The annual growth rate of consumer credit alsostrengthened in 2004, although from a more
subdued level and with a lag compared with thedevelopments in lending for house purchase.Chart 15 Housing market dynamics andloans in euro area countries(average annual growth between 1998 and 2003; percentages)Source: ECB calculations based on MFI data for loans andlatest available national data on house prices.

survey also indicate that the availability of bothcredit for consumption and other lendingimproved as lending conditions eased over the
course of 2004.38ECBAnnualReport
2004RISING HOUSEHOLD DEBTThe increased borrowing of householdsresulted in a further edging-up of the ratio of
household debt to GDP (see Chart 17). The rise
in the debt-to-GDP ratio is partly a reflection ofthe move towards an environment of pricestability and lower interest rates in several euro
area countries after the adoption of the euro.
Indeed, the debt service burden (i.e. the ratio of
interest payments and principal repayments
to disposable income) remained fairly low as aresult of the low level of interest rates. Thedebt-to-GDP ratio of euro area households also
remained low for example relative to the
United Kingdom and the United States.
Nonetheless, this rise in debt is not without
risk, as it increased households™ exposure tochanges in interest rates, income and assetprices. The risk of higher sensitivity applies,
for instance, to households that, under the
historically low interest rate conditions,
financed mortgages at variable rates with low
initial interest payments. Estimates of thissensitivity are surrounded by considerableuncertainty because, for instance, the share ofexisting mortgage debt exposed to changes in
prevailing interest rate conditions depends on
the features of the underlying mortgage
contracts. These features are linked to thenational mortgage market structure, culturalhabits and historical factors, as well as
regulatory and fiscal issues, all of which vary
substantially across the euro area.4LOW COST OF EXTERNAL FINANCING FOR
NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS
Debt financing conditions for non-financialcorporations in the euro area remained very
favourable throughout 2004, as was reflected in
corporate bond market rates and bank interest
rates. Firms enjoyed low debt financing costsand generally unconstrained access to sourcesof finance.As regards financing in the form of securities,the yields on bonds issued by non-financial
corporations stood at historically low levels
both in nominal and in real terms (seeChart 18). At the same time, real dividendyields (which can be seen as an indicator for the
real cost of equity financing), while remaining
at a somewhat higher level than their average
since the mid-1990s, declined from the peak
observed in 2003.The low cost of bond financing is to a largeextent a consequence of the historically low
levels of interest rates across the maturity
spectrum, as well as a reflection of investors™
perceptions of a positive outlook for corporatecredit risk in the euro area. Spreads betweencorporate bonds and government bonds,
particularly for AA and BBB-rated bonds,
declined further in 2004 from already low
levels. The decline in spreads may be explained
by fundamental factors such as the pronounceddecline in volatility in financial markets (seeBox 3 entitled ﬁCommon trends in implied
financial market volatilityﬂ) and improvements
in corporate profitability. At the same time, in4For further details, see the box entitled ﬁFeatures of mortgage

2004the context of low interest rates, the possibilitycannot be ruled out that an extensive search for
yield by investors continued to play a role in the
fall in corporate yields.Turning to the financing costs associated withMFI loans, which are the main form of debt
financing for non-financial corporations, MFI
interest rates remained broadly stable in 2004
(see Chart 16), after the declines which
occurred in 2002 and 2003, and were very lowoverall.Firms may have also had easier access to bankcredit in 2004. The results of the bank lending
survey conducted by the Eurosystem indicate a
gradual decrease in the net tightening of creditstandards applied to loans to enterprises duringthe first half of 2004, which became a net
easing in the second half of the year. At the
same time, there were some differences
between large enterprises and small and
medium-sized enterprises in terms of financing
costs (see Box 4 entitled ﬁWere small andmedium-sized enterprises subject to lessfavourable financing conditions than large
enterprises in the euro area in 2004?ﬂ).Box 4WERE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES SUBJECT TO LESS FAVOURABLE FINANCING

CONDITIONS THAN LARGE ENTERPRISES IN THE EURO AREA IN 2004?
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may, in general, be subject to greater constraints
than large companies in terms of costs of financing and access to external finance. In contrast to
larger firms, SMEs are typically not able to raise financing in the capital markets and,
therefore, have to rely predominantly on bank credit or more expensive types of external
finance (e.g. trade credit, leasing and factoring, etc.). In addition, smaller firms would be
expected, on average, to suffer more from problems relating to potential creditors™ lack ofinformation when trying to obtain funding as they are often younger and face less rigorousreporting requirements (i.e. they provide less detailed accounting statements, etc.). Moreover,
SMEs tend to have less collateral (e.g. fixed assets) to offer, which could mitigate the problems
of inadequate information, than more established larger firms. As a consequence, banks may
often apply tighter credit standards to loans to smaller and younger firms as they tend to have
less information about these firms.Chart 18 Indicators of market-basedfinancing costs of non-financialcorporations(percentages per annum)Sources: ECB, Thomson Financial Datastream, Merrill Lynch

Furthermore, SMEs often face higher financing costs (e.g. in terms of bank interest rates) thanlarger enterprises. The relatively higher interest rates on small-sized loans may be explained
by a number of factors. For example, there may be fixed costs of lending that are notproportional to the size of the loan. Small corporations may also be riskier than larger and moreestablished ones (although the diversification effects for banks may even be greater with
respect to loans to SMEs). In addition, there may be a lack of competition among lenders to
SMEs, which may thus be better able to ﬁlock inﬂ their small-sized borrowers, thereby
increasing these borrowers™ bank switching costs. Moreover, owing to their relatively
constrained access to, and higher costs of, external financing, SMEs traditionally rely more oninternal financing by holding, on average, more liquid assets in their balance sheets. Sinceholding liquid assets is costly, this may represent an additional burden for small enterprises.1Against this background, increasing attention has recently been paid to SMEs™ financing
conditions in the euro area. The bank lending survey (BLS), which is conducted by the
Eurosystem four times a year, provides qualitative information on the financing conditions ofSMEs and large enterprises. In particular, the BLS reports the changes in credit standards forloans granted to large enterprises and SMEs (see Chart A). Since the fourth quarter of 2002,
banks™ credit standards for loans to SMEs and large companies have followed a broadly similar
pattern of a gradual decrease in the net
tightening of credit standards. The credit
standards applied to loans to large enterpriseshave tended, on average, to be marginally lesstight, and were even eased (in net terms) from
the second quarter of 2004 onwards. In the
fourth quarter of 2004 the net tightening of
credit standards on loans to SMEs declined
relatively more and eased for the first timesince the start of the BLS.The introduction of the new MFI interest ratestatistics (from January 2003 onwards) allows
rates on loans of different sizes (below and
above 1 million) to be compared.2 Assumingthat loans of more than 1 million are grantedmore often to large enterprises, a comparison
of interest rates charged on loans of different
sizes may provide some information on
SMEs™ costs of financing compared with
those of large enterprises. Naturally, this canonly be a rough distinction. Throughout theperiod from January 2003 to December 2004,

loans (as measured by MFI interest rates on1For a more detailed discussion of the financing of SMEs in Europe, see ﬁEurope™s changing financial landscape: The financing o

interest rates on larger MFI loans (as
measured by MFI interest rates on loans of
more than 1 million to non-financialcorporations) (see Chart B). Overall in theperiod since January 2003, the spreadsbetween small-sized loans and large-sized
loans changed only slightly. Looking at recent
developments in more detail, in 2004, the
spread of interest rates on small-sized loans
over both those on large-sized loans with overone year™s and up to five years™ initial ratefixation and those on such loans with over five
years™ initial rate fixation decreased slightly
(by 10 and 15 basis points respectively),
while it remained broadly unchanged over the
interest rates on loans with floating rates andup to one year™s initial rate fixation.It is difficult to draw firm conclusions on thebasis of the evidence available. While the cost
of financing of SMEs remained relatively
high compared with large companies, thedevelopments in 2004 were broadly similarfor small and large companies. At the same
time, some evidence suggests that SMEs™
access to finance improved significantly in
the same period.LIMITED RECOURSE TO EXTERNAL FINANCING

DURING 2004Despite financing conditions remaining
favourable, non-financial corporations had
only limited recourse to external financing in
2004. The annual rate of growth of debt
financing stood at 4.8% at the end of 2004,
slightly higher than the 4.5% at the end of 2003.In the second half of 2004, it picked upsomewhat mainly as a result of an increase in
loan financing (see Chart 19). Indeed, the
annual growth rate of MFI loans to non-
financial corporations rose to 5.4% at the end
of 2004, from 3.5% at the end of 2003. At thesame time, the growth rate of the net debtsecurities issuance activity of non-financialcorporations was considerably lower in 2004than in the previous year, declining from 10.5%at the end of 2003 to 2.4% at the end of 2004.The fact that, overall, debt financing flowsremained relatively subdued may be related
to several factors. First, improvements incorporate profitability, at least for majorcompanies in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX
index (see Chart 14), by boosting internal
savings, may have increased the incentive of
firms to reduce their total debt. Second, the
relatively slow growth of debt financing mightalso reflect the gradual nature of the current42ECBAnnualReport
2004economic recovery. In this respect, companiesappeared to adopt a cautious wait-and-see
approach with regard to the financing ofadditional large capital investments.In 2004 there was also a slowdown in indirectfinancing of non-financial corporations
through companies in the non-monetary
financial corporations sector. This sectorincludes financial subsidiaries of non-financialcorporations, special-purpose vehicles and
other corporations which raise funds on behalf
of banks.The annual growth rate of net issuance ofdebt securities by non-monetary financialcorporations declined from 22.3% at the end of
2003 to 13.2% at the end of 2004. Nevertheless,
it remained strong compared with the issuance
activity of the other sectors.The annual growth rate of quoted share
issuance by non-financial corporations in the
euro area was 0.9% at the end of 2004, broadlyunchanged from the very low level observedover the previous two years. The low recourse
to equity financing is a consequence both of
relatively low demand for external financing
and of the very low cost of other sources of
finance. The low net issuance of quoted sharesis also, to some extent, a reflection of a numberof more structural developments, such as the
delisting of stocks and buyback operations,
which are principally carried out by companies
that have generated enough cash to both
reinvest in their businesses and buy back theirstocks.The favourable financing conditions led tosome improvement in the balance sheet
positions of firms in 2004 (see Chart 20). From
a historical perspective, corporate debt ratiosremained at a rather high level. However, as aChart 19 Contribution to the annualrate of growth of debt of non-financialcorporations(percentage points)Source: ECB.

Overall HICP inflation in the euro area stood at
an average of 2.1% in 2004, unchanged from
the previous year (see Table 1). Higher oilprices and further increases in indirect taxesand administered prices were the main factors
exerting upward pressure on prices. These
were offset by a further strengthening of the
euro, subdued demand conditions and the
substantial decline in the annual growth rateof unprocessed food prices. Yet, despitethe sizeable upward impact of oil price
developments on euro area consumer prices,
there was little evidence of stronger underlying
inflationary pressures building up in the euro
area economy. Producer prices grew at an
average annual rate of 2.3% in 2004, comparedwith 1.4% in 2003, largely on account ofincreases in energy and intermediate goods
prices. However, there were only limited signs
of significant pass-through to prices at a later
stage of the production chain. Similarly, wage
increases remained contained in 2004, in thecontext of ongoing moderate growth and labour
market developments.In January 2005 overall HICP inflation fellto 1.9%, a decline of 0.5 percentage pointcompared with December 2004. This declinewas broadly based across components of HICP
inflation and partly driven by base effects. It
also reflected additional favourable influences
from the decline in the annual growth rate of
energy prices, the fall in unprocessed foodprices and deeper seasonal sales discounts insome euro area countries.HEADLINE INFLATION AFFECTED BY VOLATILE

COMPONENTSThe volatile components of the HICP, inparticular energy and to a lesser extentunprocessed food prices, largely explain the
pattern of headline inflation in 2004 (see
Chart 21).Oil prices were higher than expected in 2004.In December, the average euro price of a barrelof Brent crude oil stood 25% above its averagein December 2003 (see Box 5 for more details
on the impact of oil prices on the euro area
economy). This put significant direct upward
pressure on consumer energy prices in the euro
area, which rose by an average of 4.5% in 20042002200320042003200420042004200420042005

inflation rate in 2004 was the highest in fouryears (see Chart 22).Driven by strong base effects in the energycomponent of the HICP, headline inflation
declined to around 1.7% year on year in the first
quarter of 2004. It then started to rise in line withunexpected energy price increases and peaked at2.5% in May. This upward pressure largely offset
the moderating impact of unprocessed food
prices, for which the annual growth rate declined
from 2.1% on average in 2003 to 0.6% in 2004.
Over the summer and autumn, unprocessed foodprices, dampened by favourable weatherconditions, had a moderating influence onoverall HICP developments. However, HICP
inflation remained slightly above 2% until theend of the year.Other sources of external inflationarypressures were also at work in 2004. In
particular, non-oil commodity prices increased
strongly in the first half of the year, beforemoderating. However, the significantappreciation of the euro partly offset the
inflationary impact of both oil and non-oil
commodity prices.The remaining, less volatile components of theHICP contributed to some persistence in45ECBAnnualReport
2004headline inflation in 2004, notably due todevelopments in indirect taxes and
administered prices. As in 2003, further
increases in tobacco taxes were introduced in
several euro area countries, contributing tosignificant upward pressure on processed foodprices. Consequently, processed food prices
grew at an average of 3.4% in 2004, compared
with 3.3% in 2003. The annual rate of change
of non-energy industrial goods prices stood
at 0.8% in 2004, unchanged from 2003. Adecline in this component was prevented byincreases in administered prices, in particularfor healthcare goods and pharmaceutical
products. Similarly, government measures
targeting administered prices for health care
triggered substantial increases in medical,
dental and hospital services prices. Theseexplained the increase in overall servicesprice growth, from 2.5% in 2003 to 2.6% in
2004. The upward impact of energy prices
on transport costs also contributed, albeit to a
lesser extent, to the increase in services prices
as a whole. Box 5 details the impact of oil pricedevelopments on the euro area economy.Box 5OIL PRICES AND THE EURO AREA ECONOMY

Finally, it gives a tentative quantification of the impact of the oil price increase, but stresses
that some effects cannot be captured by models.Developments in oil prices from a longer-term perspectiveOil prices in US dollars rose to record levels in nominal terms during 2004. There are, however,

Increases in Brent crude oil prices overspecific periods(percentage change of the annual average)Sources: IMF and ECB calculations.was considerably smaller than those observedduring other major oil price shocks (see
table). On average, the price of Brent crude
oil in 2004 was 33% higher than in 2003.Nonetheless, as a result of the overallappreciation of the euro against the US dollar,
oil prices in euro terms went up by 20% in
2004. Second, after taking account of inflation, i.e. in real terms, oil prices were significantly
lower in 2004 than they were during earlier periods of high prices (see Chart A). Third, the
factors driving the price increase in 2004 also differed from earlier oil price shocks. In contrastto the oil price increases of 1973, 1979, 1990 and 1999, which were mainly caused by sizeabledisruptions to the supply of oil, a variety of factors had an impact on oil prices in 2004. These
factors include buoyant demand for oil that surpassed expectations, the dwindling global spare
capacity and concerns over the security of supplies from several oil-producing countries.Transmission of oil price changes to euro area inflationTurning to the impact of the oil price increase on euro area prices, it is helpful to distinguish
between direct, indirect and second-round effects.1 First, direct effects refer to the impact of anoil price change on the overall HICP through its immediate effect on consumer prices of
energy. The energy component constitutes 8% of the overall HICP and is strongly correlated
with oil prices in euro terms. Chart B shows the contribution of the most important oil-related
items of the energy component to the annual overall HICP inflation rate along with oil pricedevelopments. This chart shows that the direct effect materialises within a year of the oil priceincrease.1See also the article entitled ﬁOil prices and the euro area economyﬂ in the November 2004 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin 
andthe box entitled ﬁRecent oil price developments and their impact on euro area pricesﬂ in the July 2004 issue of the same public
ation.47ECBAnnualReport
20042For further information, see also the article referred to in footnote 1.
Second, indirect effects refer to the possibility that, in addition to direct effects, an oil priceshock, by increasing energy input costs, may have an impact on the prices of other goods and
services. This may result in a more general rise in prices, although it also depends on the extent
to which profit margins can absorb rising costs. As an example, Chart C illustrates the indirecteffect through transport-related service components of the HICP. The contribution of thesecomponents to overall HICP inflation tends to increase with some lag after oil price increases.
It should, however, be noted that other factors also have an impact on these components, while
other components of the HICP are also indirectly affected by oil price changes.Finally, second-round effects refer to the possibility that, in addition to the direct and indirecteffects mentioned above, an oil price shock may have a further impact on inflation because itmight result in higher wage claims to compensate for the decline in real income. Such second-
round effects tend to occur with a lag. Typically, besides the expectations concerning the
persistence of the shock, the occurrence of second-round effects depends on whether the
economic context, in particular the labour market situation, encourages higher wage claims. In
2004, second-round effects related to the oil price shock remained contained owing to thecyclical position of the euro area economy and labour market conditions. Less wage indexationthan in the 1970s and 1980s may have also contributed to reducing the role played by inflation
in the wage formation process.Transmission of oil price changes to euro area output growthThere are primarily two channels through which oil price shocks affect the real economy. First,there is the supply-side channel, because oil is an important input factor in the productionprocess. A rise in the price of oil entails, particularly in the short term, an increase in
production costs, as the options for substituting other energy sources for oil are limited. The
level of output may fall as a result of the oil price increase, which may also imply lower demand
for other production factors such as labour. Second, on the demand side, an increase in oil
prices entails a deterioration in the terms of trade of net oil-importing economies like the euroarea. The resulting decline in real income translates into lower domestic demand insofar as it isnot compensated for by reduced saving or increased borrowing. A number of other channels,
which are more difficult to measure, transmit the effects of an oil price shock via confidence or
stock markets for example.Model-based quantification of the impact of the oil price increaseThe impact of the oil price increase observed over the last year on euro area inflation and real
GDP growth can be approximated using different models. Such estimations generally suggest
that a 20% increase in oil prices raises euro area inflation by about 0.2 percentage point in the
first year, with a further impact of around 0.1 percentage point expected for the following two
years. As regards real GDP growth, the estimated impact would amount to around -0.1 to -0.3percentage point in the first year, with only a minor effect in the second and third years.248ECBAnnualReport
2004The simulation results should, however, not be taken at face value. On the one hand, severalcaveats should be clearly borne in mind, such as the possible existence of non-linearities and
asymmetries, and the fact that models do not include all possible transmission channels. On the
other hand, it should also be noted that, from a structural perspective, several factors suggestthat the euro area economy has become more resilient to oil price shocks in recent years, withthe result that model simulations could overestimate the impact. First of all, compared with the
1970s, the oil intensity of production and the share of oil consumption in total energy
consumption have fallen significantly in the euro area. Moreover, labour and product markets
appear to have become somewhat more flexible, allowing for a smoother and faster
reallocation of resources, which should reduce the impact of an oil price shock on the economy.Furthermore, the credibility and the reaction of monetary policy play an important role indetermining the impact of oil price increases on the euro area economy, rendering
quantification of the effect uncertain.However, further structural reforms are clearly needed to increase the ability of the euro areaeconomy to adjust more smoothly and quickly to future shocks. In particular, increasing thedegree of effective competition in the euro area energy sector would be highly beneficial as itwould allow higher oil prices to be absorbed without significant distortions. To this end,
compensating for oil price increases with fiscal measures, such as tax cuts, is not advisable
because this would increase existing distortions in the allocation of resources and thus prevent
economic agents from adjusting to such an external shock.DYNAMIC RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES
Euro area residential property prices, which are
not included in the measurement of the HICP,
continued to rise strongly in 2004, increasing
by 6.9% in the first half of 2004 compared
with the first half of 2003. This figure concealscontrasting developments across euro areacountries, with double-digit increases in Spain,
Ireland, France and Italy, and a small decline in
Germany. Available data for the second half of
2004 suggest that strong price increases
continued, which would make 2004 thefourth consecutive year in which residentialproperty prices increased by around 6-7% (see
Chart 23). However, this period of sustained
and robust increases followed a period of
relatively modest increases (of less than 3%)
during the mid-1990s.INCREASING PRODUCER PRICES AT EARLY STAGES

OF THE PRODUCTION CHAIN
The overall annual rate of growth of industrial
producer prices in the euro area (excluding
construction) rose steadily in the course of2004 (see Chart 24). The increase gatheredmomentum in the second quarter and wasprimarily driven by energy and intermediate
goods prices. This is in line with rising oil and
non-oil commodity prices, which put pressure
on input prices at early stages of the production
chain. On average, intermediate goods pricesrose by 3.5% in 2004, compared with 0.8% in2003.There was, however, little sign of significantprice pressures building up at later stages of the
production chain. On average, consumer goodsproducer prices grew by 1.3%, still below theirhistorical average but above the average
increase of 1.1% in 2003. A significant part of
the increase in consumer goods producer prices
between 2003 and 2004 resulted from tobacco
tax increases. More generally, as it takes timefor upward pressure from input prices to feedthrough the production chain, the lagged effect
of commodity price increases, already
observed at earlier stages of production, on
consumer goods producer prices may have only
started to gather momentum in early 2005.However, subdued demand conditions may49ECBAnnualReport

2004Labour cost indicators in the euro areacontinued to ease in 2004 compared with recent
years (see Table 2). Growth in compensation
per employee showed a decline in the first half
of 2004, with an average annual growth rate of2.2% compared with 2.4% in 2003. Thisdecline was broadly based across the mainsectors of the economy (see Chart 25), although
it was somewhat stronger in market-related
services. Available data on compensation peremployee in the second half of 2004 point to afurther moderation of wage growth. This is also
suggested by other labour cost indicators. The
annual growth rate of negotiated wages stood
at 2.2% in 2004, compared with 2.4% in 2003.

51ECBAnnualReport
20042004 was broadly in line with expectationstowards the end of 2003. The recovery was led
by the strength of exports, which were 5.6%
higher in 2004 than in 2003. Domestic demand,
especially investment, was also higher.However, various developments which had notbeen fully anticipated prevented the recovery
from strengthening over the course of 2004. In
particular, growth on a quarter-on-quarter
basis was higher in the first half of the year than
in the second. Oil price and exchange ratedevelopments weighed on growth, and onlygradually improving labour market conditions
and low consumer confidence contributed to
the weakness in private consumption.From mid-2003 to mid-2004 the recovery
was largely driven by export growth, while

the contribution of final domestic demand

(i.e. excluding changes in inventories) was

relatively modest (see Chart 26). The moderation
of quarter-on-quarter growth in the second half
of 2004 largely resulted from a marked decline in

the contribution from the external sector, which

was only partially compensated for by gradually

increasing final domestic demand growth. The

contribution from inventories was relatively
significant in some quarters during the recovery
but was also volatile. With the exception of

changes in inventories, these developments are

broadly 
consistent with the characteristics ofrecoveries 
observed in the past few decades in the
euro area.As regards the domestic side, quarter-on-quarter growth in private consumption was onaverage relatively weak during 2004, reflectingnot only subdued labour market developments
but also continuing uncertainty regarding the
implementation of necessary structural reforms
(see Box 6 for more details on the progress
with structural reforms). This is likely to haveweighed on consumer confidence. Gross fixedcapital formation rose significantly during
2004, despite the negative impact of significant
declines in German construction investment
growth in the first half of the year and of falls in
general government investment in the secondhalf.The pattern of economic growth in 2004 wasalso influenced by specific external factors,
including oil price and exchange ratedevelopments. Euro area growth was affectednot only by the direct impact of oil price
increases, in the form of increased production
costs and reduced purchasing power of
consumers™ income, but also indirectly via the
impact on the international environment. Thestrong expansion of global economic activityobserved at the beginning of 2004 was
dampened in the second half of the year. It was
affected by, among other factors, oil price
increases recorded from mid-2004 onwards,
which thus contributed to reducing the growthof foreign demand for euro area exports duringthe second half of the year. Similarly, the
significant appreciation of the euro exchange
rate observed during most of 2003, despite
having reduced the cost of oil for euro area
importers, also had a lagged negative effect onthe competitiveness of the euro area as a whole.Chart 26 Contributions to quarterly realGDP growth(quarterly percentage point contributions; seasonally adjusted)Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.1) Percentage change compared with the previous quarter.

2004Box 6PROGRESS WITH STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN EU LABOUR AND PRODUCT MARKETS
Structural reforms in product and labour markets are essential to enhance Europe™s economicgrowth potential, facilitate adjustment and increase resilience to shocks. Measures to raise the
potential rate of economic growth are all the more important in view of the downward impact
that population ageing is likely to have on future labour supply. In March 2000 the Lisbon
European Council introduced an ambitious reform agenda aimed at making the EU the mostcompetitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. The November2004 report by the high-level group chaired by Wim Kok1 formed the starting point for the mid-term review of this strategy. In February 2005 the European Commission™s Spring Report to
the European Council called for increased national ownership of the Lisbon strategy, its
simplification and streamlining and an increased focus on growth and employment. The mid-
term review of the strategy was concluded by the European Council in March 2005. This boxbriefly reviews the progress made in implementing the EU™s reform agenda over recent yearsand particularly in 2004.The EU defines overarching priorities for various fields of economic policy in the BroadEconomic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs). These priorities then form the basis of policy
recommendations which are made for each EU Member State. In the field of labour markets,the BEPGs for the period 2003-05, together with the update of the BEPGs carried out in 2004 to
incorporate the new Member States, stress the need to: (i) improve the combined incentive
effects of taxes and benefits in order to make work pay, (ii) ensure efficient, active labour
market policies targeted towards the most disadvantaged groups, (iii) promote a more flexible
organisation of work and review employment contract regulations, (iv) facilitate geographical
and occupational mobility, and (v) ensure that wage bargaining systems allow wages to reflectproductivity.Over recent years a number of countries have implemented reforms in their tax and benefitsystems in order to reduce non-wage labour costs and encourage labour supply. Income tax
rates have decreased in the bottom and middle income brackets and employees™ and employers™
social security contributions have been reduced, particularly for the low-paid. Moreover,progress has been made in increasing the employment rate among people on the margins of thelabour market. Some Member States have strengthened the role of temporary work agencies
and relaxed employment protection legislation on temporary contracts. There have also been
changes to working time regulations to allow for a more flexible calculation of maximum
allowable working hours across the EU, and the right to work part-time has been extended in
some countries. There is some evidence that firms have acquired greater flexibility in their useof labour resources as a result of reforms implemented in the past. For example, recentevidence suggests that the adjustment of working hours played a more important role in the
euro area in the 2001-03 slowdown than in earlier cycles.21For more details, see Section 1.1 of Chapter 4.
2For more details, see the box entitled ﬁDevelopments in total hours worked in the euro areaﬂ in the October 2004 issue of the 
ECB™s
Monthly Bulletin.53ECBAnnualReport
2004Most EU Member States introduced further labour market reforms in 2004, including thecontinued reform of income tax systems, the restructuring of social security and benefit
systems, and policies to increase the average retirement age. However, reforms seem to lag
behind what is implied in government announcements. Limited progress has been made inattracting more people into the labour market, investing in human capital accumulation andincreasing the adaptability of both workers and enterprises to changing macroeconomic
conditions. Measures that aim to reduce long-term unemployment through retraining and seek
to increase labour productivity through vocational and professional development and lifelong
learning continue to be priority areas for reform. Moreover, further reforms are needed to
encourage labour mobility by improving the transferability of pensions and healthcare rightsand by allowing wage differentiation according to local, regional and sectoral differences inproductivity.The structural reform agenda for product markets covers a wide range of areas. Among otherthings, the BEPGs urge Member States to foster competition in goods and services markets by:(i) transposing internal market directives more quickly into national legislation, (ii) furtheropening up public procurement, (iii) giving adequate powers and resources to competitionand regulatory authorities and ensuring their independence, (iv) reducing state aid and
(v) encouraging market entry and effective competition in network industries.The percentage of EU internal market legislation which Member States had not yet transposedinto national law (known as the ﬁtransposition deficitﬂ) increased further. The European
Commission has taken several steps to improve the functioning of the internal market, inparticular in the service sector, where some significant barriers to its functioning remain. Manyof these barriers appear to be due to national regulations, for example administrative burdens
and procedures for setting up subsidiaries in other EU countries. At the beginning of 2004 the
Irish, Dutch, Luxembourg and British presidencies agreed upon a joint initiative to prioritise
regulatory reforms over the course of 2004 and 2005 and step up efforts to reduce the
administrative burden. Many countries have taken steps to improve the efficiency andtransparency of public procurement procedures. In addition, some countries have increased thepowers and independence of their competition and regulatory authorities. Moreover, the trend
towards reducing and redirecting state aid towards horizontal objectives seems to have
continued over recent years, although state aid still plays an important role in some sectors,
such as transport. Member States have continued to implement regulatory reforms in network
industries, although the regulatory reform agenda in this area has not yet been completed.De facto competition in previously sheltered sectors, such as electricity and gas, should beincreased further.To sum up, further progress with structural reform was made in 2004, especially in labourmarkets, but overall the pace of reform remained disappointing. As a result, the EU will most
likely not be able to achieve the Lisbon targets unless Member States vigorously step up theirefforts to implement reform. Renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will notonly increase overall economic efficiency and enhance longer-term growth prospects, but will
also strengthen the basis for a sustained economic upswing.54ECBAnnualReport
2004From a sectoral perspective, value addedgrowth tended to track overall real output
developments over the cycle. In particular,
value added growth in both manufacturing and
purely market-related services was sustainedduring the first half of 2004 but moderated inthe second half. The cyclical movement of the
economy in the past year seems therefore to
have been driven mainly by aggregate, rather
than sector-specific, disturbances.Various dispersion measures indicate that thedivergence of real GDP growth rates among
euro area countries declined in 2004.
Reflecting in part the global economic
upswing, average annual real GDP growth
increased in all euro area countries in 2004compared with the year before, except inGreece, where it nonetheless remained
relatively strong.IMPROVEMENT IN LABOUR MARKET AND

PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN 2004
Labour market conditions did not changesignificantly in the euro area in 2004, althoughsigns of a gradual improvement can be
detected. After remaining broadly unchanged
in 2003, employment rose throughout 2004 (see
Table 4). The overall increase was moderate,however. This was partly in line with the
lagged response of employment to economic
activity but also reflected the unusual
resilience of employment (measured in terms
of persons employed) during the economicslowdown in 2001-03, which lessened the needto hire labour at this stage of the upturn. While
developments in the number of persons
employed were relatively stable during the
recent cyclical phases, available evidence
indicates that employment in terms of hoursworked was more responsive to the businesscycle. This suggests that during the recent
slowdown and subsequent recovery employers
may have decided to adjust employment more
in terms of hours than in terms of persons
employed.Employment continued to decline in industry(excluding construction) in the course of 2004,
although to a decreasing extent over successive
quarters, while it rose continuously in the
services sector. Labour productivity continued
to recover significantly during 2004(especially in the industrial sector) (seeChart 27). Labour productivity growth had
been increasing since mid-2003, reflecting
usual cyclical developments in activity and
employment.2002200320042002200220032003200320032004200420042004

Box 7POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE IN THE EURO AREA
Recent and projected demographic dynamics in the euro area, as in many other industrialisedcountries, are characterised by decreasing population growth and a gradual ageing of the
population. These developments are the result of low fertility rates in most euro area countries
and increasing life expectancy. Although considerable uncertainty surrounds all demographic
projections, these patterns seem to be common to most, including those by Eurostat and theUnited Nations. This box discusses some of the main implications.Demographic changesAccording to the most recent projections available for euro area countries (the United Nations2002 World Population Prospects1), total fertility rates in the euro area are expected to remainbelow the population replacement level of about two children per woman in the period to 2050. At
the same time, average life expectancy is expected to increase by five years between 2005 and
2050 (see left-hand panel of the chart below). The combination of these two effects implies a
slowdown in the euro area™s population growth rate and, from around 2015, a decline in its total
population. Furthermore, the proportion of older people (aged 65 and over) in the population is
projected to increase and the proportion of people of working age (aged 15 to 64) to decrease (seeright-hand panel of the chart below), gradually at first and then at a faster rate from around 2015.This would imply an increase in the euro area™s old age dependency ratio (i.e. the ratio of the
population aged 65 and above to the population aged 15 to 64) from about 26% in 2005 to about
30% in 2015 and to more than 52% in 2050, a total increase of about 26 percentage points over the
period 2005 to 2050.57ECBAnnualReport
2004Economic implicationsSuch a demographic shift will have a profound effect on euro area economies. For example, thecomposition of the labour supply will change as the proportion of older workers increases, and
the labour supply may even fall if workers continue to retire early and too few new workers
enter the labour market to replace those leaving it. The projected decrease in the working age
population will exert downward pressure on the growth rate of potential output of the euro area,
unless it can be compensated for by increased contributions from other growth factors, such asincreases in labour market participation, labour productivity and/or the productive use of otherresources such as capital. There has been some discussion of the extent to which immigration
may help to increase labour supply. Most studies suggest that the role of migration in
addressing Europe™s demographic challenge is likely to be small and temporary, being limited
by the number of potential migrants relative to the size of the problem and by practical and
political constraints.The financing of social security systems, and in particular public pension systems based on thepay-as-you-go principle, will also come under pressure as the ratio of the number of pensioners to
the number of contributors to pension and health systems rises. Public expenditure on health and
long-term care is expected to increase as progress in medical technologies continues to be made
and the demand for these services grows with the number of elderly people. The size of these
potential effects could be substantial. Estimates by the European Commission™s Economic PolicyCommittee™s Working Group on Ageing Population suggest additional pension expenditure ofbetween 3% and 6% of GDP by 2050 in most euro area countries. A further increase in expenditure
of 2% to 4% of GDP could result from rising health and long-term care costs.Population ageing is also likely to induce changes in the structure of financial markets and thepricing of financial assets. Households of different generations typically hold differentamounts of financial assets and choose assets with different risk profiles for their investmentportfolios. Given that long-run demand for housing depends, inter alia, on the number of
households in an economy, demographic changes may also affect real estate prices.
Furthermore, pension reforms, in particular a move towards more private funding, are likely to
have a significant effect on financial markets as the role of institutional investors, such as
pension funds and insurance corporations, increases. The limited availability of long timeseries of financial prices, measurement problems and the fact that typically only a smallfraction of the population hold equities limit the extent to which possible effects of
demographic change on financial markets can be quantified. However, simulations carried out
using models based on the ﬁlife-cycleﬂ theory generally find that an ageing population implies
a decrease in financial asset prices (both equities and bonds) and an increase in the required
equity premium when the currently active population retires.The need for comprehensive reformsTo cope with such effects of demographic change, governments need to undertake
comprehensive reforms. Such reforms should aim to address specific problems in pension and
healthcare systems, reduce overall public debt and strengthen the forces driving economicgrowth. Within the EU, governments have agreed on a three-pronged strategy. This strategywas first set out in the 2001 BEPGs and comprises three broad objectives: to raise employment58ECBAnnualReport
2004rates, reduce government debt and reform pension systems, including moves towards greaterreliance on funding.In euro area countries there is an urgent need to increase labour market participation andemployment for all groups within the working age population and particularly some, such as
over 55-year-olds, among whom the participation rate is especially low. A first important step
is to further reduce the disincentives to work currently persisting within a number of euro area
labour markets due to the interplay of taxes and benefits and the provision of early retirementschemes. Such systems create disincentives particularly for second earners, low-paid workers,the youngest and oldest workers, and women. Policies to increase female labour market
participation must make it easier for women to combine family and work by increasing the
flexibility of working hours and improving services for childcare and care of the elderly.
Furthermore, in some cases it might be useful to improve incentives to continue working later
in life, for example through gradual exit-from-work policies and increased provision of part-time or temporary positions for older workers. However, there must also be sufficientincentives for employers to hire and/or retain older workers. Moreover, many countries will
need to embark on a sustained process of investment in human capital and research and
development in order to offset the possible effects of population ageing on labour and total
factor productivity.Reducing public debt would contribute to improving fiscal sustainability and thus make publicfinances less vulnerable to the impact of demographic changes. In particular, lower debt levelswould provide governments with additional leeway in times of increased ageing-related fiscal
burdens. Likewise, lower interest payments on public debt would free up fiscal resources and
give governments more flexibility to cope with any unforeseen developments. In this regard,
the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular the requirement that public
finances remain close to balance or in surplus, establish incentives in the right direction forgovernments to prepare for ageing-related fiscal burdens.The scale of the projected pressure on pension systems suggests that two sets of strategies needto be pursued in the area of pension reform. First, further adjustments to the structure of
benefits and contributions within existing pay-as-you-go arrangements are needed (parametric
reforms). These include revisions of benefit formulas and adjustments to the indexation ofpension benefits. As a complement, it will be necessary for most countries to move towardsgreater funding of benefits and the diversification of financing arrangements (systemic
reforms). Instead of through current transfers from labour income, pensions would be financed
from previously accumulated capital via pension funds. Thus, policies should be put in place to
facilitate the development of an infrastructure that would enable these funds to efficiently
allocate retirement savings and manage the related risks, and to safeguard the non-speculativecharacter of retirement savings.In conclusion, population projections suggest that demographic change in the euro area will bemost apparent from around 2015, although developments in individual countries are proceeding at
different rates and in a number of euro area countries the total population has already begun to
decline. Although many countries are starting to improve the incentive compatibility of their taxand benefit systems and the sustainability of public finances, further wide-ranging reforms arenecessary in the near future. The timely implementation of comprehensive and incentive-
compatible reforms is needed in order to prepare for demographic change.59ECBAnnualReport
20042.5FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS
BUDGET BALANCE BROADLY STABLE IN 2004
Fiscal developments in the euro area wereunsatisfactory in 2004. According to the latestdata available from Eurostat, the euro areadeficit remained broadly stable at 2.7% of
GDP (see Table 5). The budgetary outcome
in 2004 reflected a slight fiscal loosening,
while the impact of the economic cycle was
minor. Most euro area countries failed to meetthe targets set out in the updated stabilityprogrammes of end-2003 and early 2004.
Targets were missed on average by 0.3
percentage point of GDP, mainly because
of a failure to meet ambitious structural
consolidation plans on the part of countrieswith substantial imbalances.A number of countries recorded deficit ratios ator above the 3% of GDP reference value and
four countries (Germany, Greece, France and
the Netherlands) were in an excessive deficit
situation. For the third year in a row, deficitsexceeded 3% of GDP by a significant margin inGermany and France. Following significant
statistical revisions, it became clear that
according to the ESA 95 methodology Greece
had recorded deficits above the reference value
since 1997; its deficit for 2004 was 6.1% ofGDP. Italy posted a deficit of 3.0% ofGDP and Portugal recorded a deficit of just
below 3% of GDP, despite the continued
(though declining) implementation of sizeable
temporary policy measures.General government surplus (+) / deficit (-)2001200220032004

2004When measured by the change in the cyclicallyadjusted primary balance according to
European Commission estimates, the budgetary
outcome 
for the euro area as a whole 
reflecteda slightly expansionary fiscal stance. Withinterest expenditure virtually unchanged, thedeterioration of the primary balance was the
main factor behind this outcome. GDP growth
is estimated to have increased broadly in line
with potential growth, and the economic
environment is therefore estimated to have hadvery little effect on the change in the cyclicalcomponent of the budget on average. Structural
consolidation was implemented in only a few
cases. All three very highly indebted countries
(Belgium, Greece and Italy) continued to
benefit from interest expenditure savings, witha favourable effect on overall budgetarypositions. This partly compensated for the
worsening of the primary balances in these
countries.Fiscal developments reflect the fact that, onaverage in the euro area, tax cuts and the gradualphasing-out of temporary adjustment measureswere insufficiently financed by savings in
primary expenditure. Revenue-reducing factors
included cuts in direct taxes and social security
contributions as well as a fall in capital
revenue due to the gradual disappearanceof temporary measures. These were partlycompensated for by increases in indirect taxes.
On the expenditure side, there is evidence ofsome restraint (mainly via public consumptionand social benefits) despite the partialdisappearance of temporary measures. While
this reflects a reversal of more lax expenditure
policies in recent years, it was not sufficient to
fully offset the revenue decline.The euro area debt-to-GDP ratio increased, forthe second year in a row, to 71.3% in 2004.
This worsening mainly reflects the low (and
falling) primary surplus ratio, the fact that
economic growth was lower than the implicit
average interest rate on public debt, and insome cases sizeable discrepancies betweendeficit and debt developments Œ known as
deficit-debt adjustments. Among the seven
countries posting debt ratios higher than 60%
of GDP, only Belgium recorded a significant
decline in its debt ratio, to below 100% of GDP,reflecting budget outcomes that remained closeto balance. Greece and Italy continued to
exhibit debt ratios above 100% of GDP, with
little change since 2001. Germany, France,
Austria and Portugal posted debt ratios
moderately above the reference value of 60% of
GDP, and in all of these countries exceptAustria the ratio increased by comparison with2003. The continued deterioration of budget
balances and the rising debt-to-GDP ratio is
also reflected in the amount of outstanding
government debt securities (see Box 8).Box 8DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES IN THE EURO AREA
Against a background of rising general government deficits in the euro area, the level of
outstanding general government debt securities has increased in recent years. This
development is reflected both in the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratios and in the higher annualgrowth rates of debt securities issued by general government in the euro area Œ 5.0%, 5.5% and5.4% at the end of 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively (against 3.3% at the end of 2001).11Growth rates are based on financial transactions and are corrected for reclassifications, revaluations, exchange rate variatio
ns andother changes that do not arise from transactions. For details, see the Technical note for Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the ﬁEuro ar
eastatisticsﬂ section in the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.

Looking at the total amount of generalgovernment debt securities outstanding at theend of 2004, the main players in this segment
of the euro area capital markets are Italy,
Germany and France, with shares ranging
between approximately 20% and 30% of the
total market (see Chart A).The evolution of the structure of outstandinggeneral government debt securities in the euro
area has three key features. First, government
debt is issued predominantly by central
government, which accounted for 94.3% ofoutstanding debt securities in 2004, withother general government responsible for
the remaining 5.7% (see the table below).
Nevertheless, the other general government
sector has become more active. The share of
debt securities issued by central government
has been steadily declining since 1998, while the share of debt securities issued by othergeneral government almost doubled between 1998 and 2004.Second, regarding the breakdown of government debt securities by maturity, long-term debtaccounted for around 91.6% of outstanding debt securities at the end of 2004. The table below
shows that the share of short-term debt declined between 1998 and 2000 but subsequently rose
again.Third, the table also indicates that the vast majority of long-term general government debtsecurities are issued at a fixed rate. Over time, the relative importance of floating-rate issues
has decreased substantially, from 12.3% of the total in 1998 to 7.6% in 2004. Underlying this
development is the gradual decline towards the end of the 1990s in the term premium paid by
some governments on fixed-rate long-term securities in an environment of price stability. Italy,Structure of amounts outstanding of debt securities issued by euro area governments(as a percentage of total debt securities issued by general government; end of period)1998199920002001200220032004

40GreeceFranceBelgiumSpainItalyAustriaIrelandFinlandNetherlandsPortugalGerman long-term bond yields have been thelowest in the euro area primarily because
German government bonds are relatively
liquid. The financing advantage of theGerman government over all other euro areagovernments in terms of basis points was in
the double-digit range until early 2001. From
that time the spreads between ten-year
government bond yields of other euro area
countries and comparable German bondyields declined constantly, reaching a low atthe end of 2003. The most significant
decreases in yield spreads have been
experienced in Belgium, Greece, Italy,
Portugal and Spain. One of the factors
underlying this convergence may have beenthe fiscal developments in Germany, where,between 2001 and 2004, the debt-to-GDP
ratio worsened relative to that of all other euro
area countries except France.Available data suggests that those countriesthat experienced an improvement in theirdebt-to-GDP ratio relative to Germany
between 2001 and 2004 also experienced a
decrease in long-term yield spreads vis-à-vis
German government bonds, as depicted by the
positive relationship in Chart C. Althoughother factors, mainly related to the liquidity ofthe bonds, may also be of importance, this may be regarded as a first indication that investors to
some extent take into account the fiscal positions of euro area governments when pricing
bonds.Overall, recent trends in the structure of government financing reflect the significantmacroeconomic advantage which has arisen in conjunction with the move to more stability-oriented policies over the last decade. The most visible benefit for the public is the
significantly lower proportion of government budgets spent on interest payments.FISCAL PLANS FOR 2005
The latest update of the stability programmessuggests that, despite some progress, too littleis planned to address the problem of budget
deficits and that comprehensive structural
reform agendas are still lacking. For 2005 the
average deficit for the euro area as a whole is
expected to decline by about half a percentagepoint of GDP. Both a marginal decline ininterest expenditure and a moderateimprovement of the primary balance shouldcontribute to this development. Economicgrowth is expected to stay near potential.
However, about half the euro area countries,
i.e. Germany, Greece, France, Italy, the
Netherlands and Portugal, are projected to
continue to report deficits close to or at 3%of GDP. Only a few are projected to be in a64ECBAnnualReport
2004close-to-balance or in-surplus position. Thedebt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline by
about half a percentage point of GDP.CONSOLIDATION IN LINE WITH PRIOR
COMMITMENTS NEEDEDPublic finances face three major challengesin the euro area. First, there is a need
for substantial fiscal consolidation:
macroeconomic stability hinges significantly
on the sustainability of public finances, whichis the ability of a government to meetits outstanding obligations (see Box 9).
Compliance with the EU fiscal framework and
the strict application of the rules are critical
because this contributes to the sustainability
of public finances in EMU. In particular,the deficit limit of 3% of GDP Œ if crediblyimplemented Œ provides an anchor for
expectations of fiscal discipline and future debt
developments. It is therefore an important
signal of fiscal soundness for financial markets
and the public.The fact that the euro area average deficit is
near the 3% reference value and that a number
of countries have deficits close to or above
this value underlines the urgent need to
strengthen the position of public finances. Theimproved economic environment offers a goodopportunity to accelerate the process of fiscal
consolidation. Growth dividends in the form
of higher than expected tax revenues should
be assigned to reducing budget imbalances.
Countries with excessive deficits shouldcorrect this situation as soon as possible andfulfil their commitments. Moreover, the
recurrence of excessive deficits needs to be
avoided. It is also desirable that those euro area
countries which do not have a budgetary
position close to balance or in surplus, but arenot in an excessive deficit situation either,progress with budgetary consolidation in line
with the Eurogroup agreement of October
2002, according to which underlying deficit
ratios should be cut by at least 0.5 percentage
point of GDP per year.Box 9FISCAL POLICY AND MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
This box discusses the main influences of fiscal policy on macroeconomic stability and pricedevelopments, as well as the way in which the EU fiscal framework reflects these influences.Fiscal policies can have an impact on the short-run macroeconomic environment viadiscretionary measures and automatic stabilisers. Discretionary measures, i.e. active changes
to government revenue or expenditure, can affect economic growth and prices, via their effect
on both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Experience over the last few decades hasshown, however, that discretionary fiscal fine-tuning, aimed at stabilising the economy, oftenproves to be pro-cyclical. Moreover, the asymmetrical use of fine-tuning measures (mainly
during downturns and to a much lesser extent during upswings) has led to higher fiscal deficits
over time. The free operation of automatic stabilisers, on the other hand, can help to smooth
economic fluctuations, via the stabilising impact of taxes and unemployment benefits on the
disposable income of households. Their automatic nature makes them timely and morepredictable, while their symmetrical operation leaves the government debt level unaffectedover a business cycle.As regards medium-term fiscal effects, the setting of fiscal policies is particularly importantfor the sustainability of public finances and potential economic growth. Fiscal sustainability
can be described as the ability of a government to meet its outstanding obligations. The ratio of65ECBAnnualReport
2004government debt to GDP gives an indication of this, although other elements, such ascontingent and implicit government liabilities, also need to be taken into consideration.
Sustainabilty of public finances has a positive impact on the macroeconomic environment, as
consumers and households do not expect major tax increases or difficulties experienced bygovernments in servicing their obligations. Economic confidence is thus enhanced, long-termdecision-making (e.g. for private investment) is facilitated and financial conditions are more
favourable. As regards potential economic growth, fiscal measures that improve the ﬁqualityﬂ
of public finances can have a beneficial effect on the economic growth rate compatible with
price stability. For example, government expenditure on physical and human capital may
improve the quality of production factors. Furthermore, tax rates have an impact on incentivesto work, save, invest and innovate. Higher growth, in turn, supports sustainability, as existingdebt is serviced by a larger economic base.Setting fiscal policy in accordance with rules is generally preferable to an ad hoc approach.Rules can discourage an undue focus on short-term gains and a disregard for longer-term costs.
Furthermore, rules can anchor expectations, thereby giving economic agents guidance onfuture fiscal policy in the event of shocks and thus facilitating longer-term planning in theprivate sector. Of course, the rules must be observed in order for these benefits to materialise.
The advantages of following rules are even greater in a monetary union such as EMU, where
distortions in fiscal incentives can be exacerbated. For instance, a larger deficit bias may arise
as, with a single currency and more integrated financial markets, the impact of a country™s
higher debt level on interest rates is smaller than before. Fiscal rules in a monetary union need
to be applicable in a straightforward manner, given that they need to apply to all membercountries in a uniform way in order to ensure equal treatment. A transparent fiscal frameworkalso raises awareness in the financial markets and the public at large, and can help to enforce
compliance with the rules.The medium-term, rule-based framework adopted in EMU takes into account both short-termstabilisation and long-term sustainability considerations. The reference values for the budgetdeficit and government debt are ways of promoting responsible fiscal behaviour. A medium-term budgetary position close to balance or in surplus contributes to short-term economic
stabilisation via the free operation of automatic stabilisers, while preventing excessive deficits
in the future and ensuring improvements in the sustainability of public finances by inducing
lower government debt ratios.From the perspective of a central bank whose primary objective is to maintain price stability,the focus of fiscal policy analysis is on the impact of fiscal policies on inflation and
macroeconomic stability because these policies form part of the environment in which
monetary policy has to operate. Sound fiscal policies facilitate monetary policy by creating an
environment of stable economic conditions, in both the short and long term.66ECBAnnualReport
2004STRUCTURAL REFORMS REMAIN VITAL
A second challenge for public finances in theeuro area is to integrate fiscal consolidation
plans into a structural reform agenda that favours
growth, competitiveness and employment. Thiswould also help to put budgetary developmentson a more sustainable footing, particularly
against the background of the increasing
fiscal burden related to ageing populations.
Expenditure reforms are crucial in this
regard, although there might also be some roomfor efficiency gains on the revenue side.Expenditure reforms allow fiscal consolidation,
pave the way for further tax cuts and may also
render tax/benefit systems more growth-
friendly. Within given expenditure budgets,
productive investments in infrastructure andhuman capital should be prioritised.RELIABLE STATISTICS UNDERPIN THE
CREDIBILITY OF THE FISCAL FRAMEWORK
Third, the integrity of government finance
statistics is a precondition for the credibility of
the EU fiscal framework. Large revisions ofpast deficit figures Œ as witnessed, for example,in the case of Greece in 2004 Œ are clearly
damaging to public confidence and the
credibility of the entire framework. They
undermine the accurate and timely
identification of imbalances and adjustmentneeds, which can cause serious delays in theimplementation of policy measures. By adding
uncertainty to fiscal monitoring, they reduce
the value of multilateral surveillance
procedures and, thus, weaken the effectiveness
of peer pressure. It is therefore of vitalimportance that action be taken to ensure thereliable compilation and timely reporting of
government finance statistics. All Member
States should respect the European accounting
rules when reporting expenditure and revenues.
As stated by the ECOFIN Council on 2 June2004, budgetary statistics must not bevulnerable to political and electoral cycles.2.6EXCHANGE RATES AND BALANCE OF
PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS
EURO CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN AMID BROAD-

BASED WEAKENING OF THE US DOLLAR
In the foreign exchange markets, movements in
the main bilateral euro exchange rates were
relatively moderate in the first nine months of
2004, particularly if compared with the marked
appreciation of the euro in the preceding
two years. Thereafter, the euro appreciatedstrongly, particularly against the US dollar. Atthe end of 2004 the euro stood in effective
terms moderately above its level at the
beginning of the year, reflecting a significant
appreciation against the US dollar, the Asian
currencies pegged to the US currency and, to asmaller extent, the Japanese yen. This waspartially counterbalanced by the depreciation
of the euro against the currencies of some
smaller trading partners of the euro area (the
Swiss franc, the Norwegian krone and the
Korean won) as well as the currencies of
several of the new EU Member States.In more detail, after the appreciation of the eurolevelled off in January and February 2004, the
euro reversed some of its earlier gains amid an
improvement in the global economic outlook
and shifting market perceptions about thefundamental forces affecting exchange rates.At that time, there were increasing signs that
the recovery was taking hold in the United
States and Japan, while the outlook for the euro
area continued to be more subdued. This served
to switch the market™s attention from the largeand persistent US current account deficittowards expectations of higher returns in the
United States, thereby providing support to the
US currency. Between May and mid-October
2004 the euro strengthened slightly, amid a
gradually improving outlook for the euro areaeconomy as tentative signs emerged ofeconomic expansion spreading from the export
sector to domestic demand. At the same time,
market concerns about the outlook for global
growth Œ fuelled mainly by geopolitical
uncertainty and soaring oil prices Œ appearedto be putting some renewed downward pressure67ECBAnnualReport
2004on the US dollar and the Japanese yen.Decisions by the FOMC to raise interest rates
had already been priced in by the financial
markets and did not affect exchange rate
developments. As of mid-October, however,the euro strengthened significantly against theUS currency, as well as against several Asian
currencies, given their formal or informal peg
to the dollar. This occurred in the context of a
broad-based weakening of the US currency in
the last quarter of 2004. During this quarter theUS dollar reached multi-year lows against theeuro, the pound sterling and the Japanese yen.At the end of 2004 the euro stood in nominaleffective terms Œ as measured against the
currencies of 23 important trading partnersof the euro area Œ 2.3% above the levelobserved at the beginning of the year. This
overall appreciation in 2004 conceals
counterbalancing movements of the euro
against a number of partner currencies included
in the effective exchange rate index. More
specifically, the euro appreciated markedlyagainst the US dollar, as well as against theChinese renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar,
which are both linked to the US currency. On
31 December 2004 the euro stood at USD 1.36,
roughly 8.2% stronger than at the beginning of
the year. During the same period the euro alsostrengthened against the Japanese yen (by3.7%) and was quoted by the end of the year
at JPY 139.7, implying an appreciation of
the Japanese yen against the US dollar by
more than 4%. Against the pound sterling,
the euro was at GBP 0.71 at the end of theyear, unchanged compared with its level on2 January 2004.At the same time, the euro moderatelydepreciated against the Swiss franc, the
Norwegian krone and, to a larger extent, theKorean won (by 6.3%). It also depreciatedagainst the currencies of several of the new
EU Member States: the Czech koruna, the
Hungarian forint, the Polish zloty and the
Slovak koruna (see also Section 3). The Cyprus
pound also appreciated slightly, while theLatvian lats, which was partially linked to theUS dollar, depreciated vis-à-vis the euro. Witheffect from 1 January 2005, however, the
Latvian lats has been pegged to the euro at

notably against the US dollar. The
developments in euro exchange rates over this
period were affected by signs of robusteconomic activity in the United States, whilemarket concerns about the US current account
deficit seem to have subsided somewhat. On

effective terms about 1.4% below its level at
the beginning of the year. The depreciationreflected a weakening against the US dollar,68ECBAnnualReport

relatively large weight in the trade-weighted
euro exchange rate index.The real effective exchange rate of the euro Œbased on cost and price indices Œ also continued
to rise in 2004, in line with the increase in the
nominal effective exchange rate (see Chart 29).
In the fourth quarter of 2004 the real effective
exchange rate indices of the euro stoodwell above their level in the first quarter of1999, and the measures based on consumer
and producer price developments were also
fairly close to the peak levels observed over
the past ten years.CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS INCREASED

SLIGHTLY IN 2004
The euro area current account surplus
increased to 40.2 billion in 2004 (i.e. around0.5% of GDP), from 22.2 billion in 2003(0.3% of GDP). This increase was largely the
result of a decline in the income andChart 29 Nominal and real effective euroexchange rates 1)(monthly/quarterly data; index: 1999 Q1 = 100)Source: ECB.

2002current transfers deficits combined with amarginal increase in the services surplus (see
Chart 30). The goods surplus remained broadly
unchanged, as exports and imports of goods
increased in value terms by a similar amount.In the course of 2004, however, the 12-monthcumulated seasonally adjusted goods surplus
experienced two significant movements. In
the first half of the year it increased (from
106 billion in December 2003 to more than125 billion in June 2004), owing particularlyto strong exports in this period. Subsequently,
though, it decreased to a level close to that seen
at the end of 2003, as a result of the strong
imports registered in the second and third
quarters of 2004 and the deceleration of exportsthat took place in the second half of the year.Turning to the fall in the income deficit, this
reflected mostly a significant increase in
income receipts, which rose much faster than
income payments. The rise in income receipts
seems for the most part to have been driven
by favourable developments in returns on69ECBAnnualReport

2002investment reflecting the strong growth ofthe global economy, which more than offset
the negative impact of the higher euro (as
an appreciation of the euro reduces the euro
value of income credits received in foreigncurrencies).Developments in exports and imports of goodscan be better understood by breaking down the
values into prices and volumes on the basis of
Eurostat™s external trade statistics (theavailable statistics cover the period up toOctober 2004). Such a breakdown shows that
the strong rise in export values that took place
in the first half of the year was mostly
accounted for by robust growth in export
volumes, while export prices remainedsubdued. It seems, therefore, that the negativeeffect of the appreciation of the euro on euro
area export volumes was more than
compensated for by the strong growth of
foreign demand during the first half of 2004. In
terms of geographical destination, the volume
of exports to Asia and the new EU MemberStates grew particularly rapidly over thisperiod. Although export prices experienced
some upward pressure from rising costs owing
to higher oil prices, this may have been partly
counterbalanced by some reductions in profit
margins as exporters attempted to partly offsetthe loss in price competitiveness resulting fromthe appreciation of the euro. The deceleration
of euro area exports in the second half of the
year seems to stem mostly from weaker exports
to Asia and the new EU Member States,
although exports to the United States alsoslowed substantially. As regards the increase inthe value of imports of goods that took place in
the second and third quarters of 2004, this
reflected rises in both prices and volumes.
Most of the rise in import prices was a result
of the higher price of oil. Part of the increasein import volumes can be attributed to therecovery in euro area domestic demand,
particularly the high import-intensity categories
of expenditure.NET INFLOWS IN COMBINED DIRECT AND

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN 2004
In the financial account, combined direct and
portfolio investment experienced net inflows
of 18.3 billion in 2004, compared with netinflows of 38.3 billion in 2003. This lowerlevel of net financial flows into the euro area
was mainly a result of increased net outflows in
direct investment (see Chart 31).Developments in direct investment can beprimarily accounted for by the gradual declinein foreign direct investment inflows into the
euro area, basically due to direct investment in
euro area equity capital by non-residents being
one-third of that recorded a year earlier. This
decline was larger than the decline in euro areadirect investment abroad in the form of equitycapital and may partly reflect a stronger growth
outlook for the global economy in 2004 relative
to the euro area.The rise in net inflows in portfolio investmentemanated mainly from an increase in netpurchases of euro area equity securities by non-residents. Market survey data indicated a70ECBAnnualReport
2004renewed interest in euro area equity securitiesamong foreign investors. The fact that euro
area equities were seen, in relative terms,
as being attractively priced, together with
expectations of an appreciation of the euro inthe course of 2004, also contributed to thisdevelopment.Turning to debt instruments, cross-borderflows were of a similar magnitude in 2003 and
2004, amounting to roughly 200 billion onboth the asset and the liability sides. On the
liability side, the low level of euro area short-
term interest rates did not encourage foreign
investment in euro area money market
instruments, with non-residents investing
almost exclusively in euro area bonds and notesin 2004. On the asset side, euro area investorsallocated about 75% of their international
portfolio of debt instruments to bonds and
notes and 25% to money market instruments.
Compared with 2003, this allocation amounted
to a smaller weight being given by euro
area residents to international bonds and notesin 2004. This may have been linked toanticipation of possible capital losses as a
result of expected higher long-term interest
rates in the United States. Indeed, euro areadebt flows to the United States declined from
75 billion in 2003 to 29 billion in the firstthree quarters of 2004.Based on cumulated flows over the first threequarters of 2004, the euro area recorded netoutflows in foreign direct investment vis-à-vis
most of its main partner countries, apart from
the United States and Switzerland. The United
Kingdom and the United States were both the
main recipients of euro area direct investmentand the main investors in the euro area.The geographical breakdown of portfolioinvestment shows that euro area portfolio
investment abroad in the first three quarters of
2004 was directed primarily towards the UnitedKingdom and the United States, which aretraditionally the main recipients of that
category of investment. Euro area investors
were also large net purchasers of Japanese
equity securities. The improvement of the
economic outlook in Japan, particularly at the
beginning of 2004, appears to have influencedthe portfolio investment decisions of euro areainvestors.71ECBAnnualReport
2004ECONOMIC ACTIVITYReal GDP growth in the non-euro area EUMember States was relatively strong in 2004
and generally exceeded the euro area average
(see Table 6). Output growth was highest in theBaltic States and Poland, the countries with thelowest level of GDP per capita in the EU. At the
other end of the scale, it was lowest in Denmark
and Malta, although real GDP growth started to
recover in these countries from the subdued
rates that prevailed in 2003.Domestic demand was the main contributor toreal GDP growth in 2004 in many non-euro area
EU Member States. In particular, gross fixed
capital formation was the key driver of output
growth. Growing industrial confidence, a highdegree of capital utilisation and an improveddemand outlook contributed to the recovery in
investment in many of the new Member States,
Denmark and Sweden. In many of the new
Member States, particularly in the Baltic
States, the robustness of domestic demand also
reflected the significant growth in privateconsumption, which was supported by gainsin real disposable income associated with
vigorous wage increases and improvements in
the labour market. In the United Kingdom,3ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS IN
NON-EURO AREA EU MEMBER STATES
private consumption growth was sustained by
the strong performance of the labour market
and growth in housing wealth. In a number of
non-euro area EU Member States, especially in
the Baltic States and Hungary, householdspending was also backed by high and, insome cases, increasing credit growth to the
private sector. In addition, in most of the
new Member States, price rise expectations
stemming from changes in taxation and
regulated prices related to EU accessionstimulated consumption spending in the firsthalf of 2004. Finally, in some countries, the
fiscal stance remained relatively loose.Turning to external demand, the contribution ofnet exports to real GDP growth variedsignificantly across the non-euro area EUMember States. While external demand
significantly supported output growth in
Poland and Sweden, it acted as a drag on
growth in most of the new Member States and
the United Kingdom. Despite this, it is
important to note that export and import growthremained relatively strong in 2004, especiallyin the new Member States. In particular, goods
and services trade volumes were spurred by the
removal of barriers to trade on EU accession,200020012002200320042004200420042004

by higher demand in trading partner countriesand by further gains in productivity.As a result of the recovery in economicactivity, sizeable foreign direct investmentinflows received in the last few years andongoing structural reform, the labour market
situation gradually improved in most non-euro
area EU Member States throughout 2004,
particularly in the Baltic States. Employment
growth, however, tended to be rather subduedin most of the new Member States, due toearlier increases in wage costs in some
countries and a structural skill mismatch
between labour supply and demand. In several
countries, especially Poland and Slovakia,
unemployment rates remained very high. In theUnited Kingdom the labour market was tighter.PRICE DEVELOPMENTSPrice dynamics in the non-euro area EUMember States were very mixed across
countries in 2004. Denmark, Lithuania,
Sweden and the United Kingdom recorded thelowest annual HICP inflation rates at around1%, thus well below the euro area average. In
most of the new Member States, inflation was
above the euro area average. In Latvia,Hungary and Slovakia, annual HICP inflation
rates were almost three times higher than the
euro area average.Most of the new Member States recordedhigher HICP inflation rates in 2004 comparedwith 2003 (see Table 7). The strongest increase
in inflation was observed in the Czech
Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and
Poland. In some non-euro area EU Member
States, however, average inflation ratesdeclined in 2004. The strongest declines wererecorded in Cyprus and Slovenia. Moreover,
the inflation pattern during 2004 varied across
countries. In a number of countries, inflation
picked up considerably in the first half of 2004
before either stabilising at a higher level orgradually declining in the second half of theyear. In a few other Member States, however,
HICP inflation rates remained broadly stable
for the whole year.Inflation developments in the non-euro area EUMember States were partly driven by somecommon factors, in particular the strongincrease in oil prices in 2004. However, the
precise impact of this factor on inflation varied
across countries, largely reflecting differences73ECBAnnualReport
2004in consumption patterns, market structures andenergy intensity of production. Moreover, in
some countries the pass-through of higher oil
prices into inflation might not have fully
materialised yet in 2004. Some inflationarypressures also emerged from strong real GDPgrowth in most countries. Consequently, wage
pressures have also started to rise in a number
of countries.In the new Member States, EU accession alsocaused some inflationary pressures. Foodprices increased in most new Member States in
the first half of the year as these countries
were integrated into the Common Agricultural
Policy and as remaining sectoral trade barriers
were removed. Given the relatively large shareof food prices in their HICP consumer baskets,this had a noticeable impact on HICP inflation
in most of the new Member States. Moreover,
indirect taxes and excise duties were increased
in a number of the new Member States to bring
them more into line with those prevailing in
the EU. The prospect of tax-induced priceincreases following EU accession led to higherdemand in early 2004, thereby also causing
higher inflation. In the second half of 2004,
however, the impact gradually started to
reverse in a number of countries. Furthermore,
in some new Member States, administeredprices have been substantially raised with aview to completing the adjustment of some
state-owned enterprises to producing at cost-
recovery levels.Nominal effective exchange rate developmentsand their lagged pass-through to import pricesalso influenced inflation developments in
2004. In a number of countries, in particular the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia,
effective exchange rate developments had a
dampening impact on inflation, while in others,such as Latvia, the impact contributed toinflation pressures. In Poland the lagged
impact of exchange rate developments
contributed in the first half of 2004 to an
increase in HICP inflation, but their impact
reversed in the second half of the year.FISCAL POLICIES
Three non-euro area EU Member States
(Estonia, Denmark and Sweden) recorded a
fiscal surplus and ten countries recorded fiscal
deficits in 2004. As set out in ECOFIN Council
decisions on 5 July 2004, six countries (theCzech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Malta,Poland and Slovakia) were found to be in an
excessive deficit situation. In all cases but
Cyprus, the Council decisions allow for the
correction of these excessive deficits in a
medium-term framework given the existence ofspecial circumstances, because (i) the generalgovernment deficit upon EU accession was
significantly above the reference value and
(ii) for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland
and Slovakia, the structural shift to a
modern service-oriented market economyaccompanying the process of real convergencewas still ongoing. The United Kingdom,
recorded a deficit ratio above the 3% reference
value in both 2003 and 2004. The large number
of countries still in an excessive deficit
situation points to a continued need for astronger political commitment to carrying outstructural reforms and fiscal consolidation.General government budget balances improvedin ten of the 13 non-euro area EU Member
States in 2004, while they deteriorated in theremaining three countries (see Table 8). The74ECBAnnualReport
2004improvement can be explained mainly bytemporary factors, as well as by the positiveeffect of the economic cycle. In the CzechRepublic and Malta, the countries recording
the largest improvement in their fiscal balance,
temporary factors had sizeable deficit-
increasing effects in 2003.In 2004 the debt ratios in most non-euro areaEU Member States remained well below the
average ratio in the euro area. The ratios
declined in six of the 13 non-euro area Member
States in line with their improved government
budget balances. In the other countries, theincrease in the debt ratios  reflected mainly thelow primary surplus ratios and debt-increasing
deficit-debt adjustments, i.e. variations in
public debt that cannot be explained by the
deficit/surplus. Only Cyprus and Malta
continued to record debt ratios above the 60%of GDP reference value.In most countries, budgetary outcomes in 2004were either broadly in line with or better than
the targets of the convergence programmes
submitted in May 2004. In several countriesrevenue collection was more favourable thananticipated. Expenditure execution wasgenerally close to the pre-set spending
paths. Hungary showed signs of significant
slippage relative to the May 2004 convergenceprogramme targets. Furthermore, somegovernments (for example, in Estonia and
Lithuania) utilised part of their excess
revenues in 2004 to finance additional
expenditure rather than improve their budget
balances.BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS
As regards external balances, Sweden and
Denmark continued to report sizeable surpluses
on current account in 2004, while the United
Kingdom and most new Member States recordedcurrent account deficits, which in somecountries were large (see Table 9). The only
exception was Slovenia, which has a history of
broadly balanced current account positions.
Particularly large current account deficits Œ
close to or above 10% of GDP Œ were observed inthe Baltic States and Hungary, while Slovakiaand Poland showed more moderate current
account deficits, which contracted in the past
two years compared with the previous two
years.General government surplus (+) / deficit (-)General government gross debt

75ECBAnnualReport
2004In many of the new Member States the rise inthe current account deficit in 2004 was
associated with strong import growth owing to
robust domestic demand and high oil prices.
Other structural and temporary factors havealso affected the current account position. Onthe structural side, current account deficits
are a normal characteristic of catching-up
economies such as the new Member States.
Whereas these deficits could signal problems
regarding the sustainability of externalpositions, the current account deficits in many
new Member States were to some extent linked
to a rise in the income deficit reflecting
earnings related to past foreign direct
investment inflows. As a transitory factor,
current account balances may have beenaffected by the EU accession process itself as,for instance, companies increased their stocks
in anticipation of higher tariffs.Looking at the financing side of the balanceof payments, net foreign direct investmentinflows recovered somewhat in most new EUMember States in 2004, having slowed the year
before (see Table 9). Among these countries,
only Slovenia recorded moderate outflows in
net foreign direct investment in 2004. As to the
other non-euro area EU Member States,Denmark and Sweden witnessed net outflowsof foreign direct investment in the same period,while in the United Kingdom, net foreign direct
investment turned positive after registering
modest outflows in previous years. Overall, net
foreign direct investment inflows constitutedan important source of financing in recent yearsfor a number of the non-euro area Member
States, although in most cases these inflows
were not sufficient to cover the current account
deficit. Net inflows in portfolio investment and
in ﬁother investmentﬂ provided additionalfinancing. As a result the external indebtednessof some countries also rose.ERM II AND EXCHANGE RATE-RELATED ISSUES
On 28 June 2004 Estonia, Lithuania and
Slovenia joined Denmark as participants inERM II. They entered the mechanism with astandard fluctuation band of ±15% around their
central rates against the euro, while Estonia
and Lithuania kept their currency boards as a
unilateral commitment. To ensure their smooth
participation in ERM II, the countries havefirmly committed to taking the necessarymeasures to preserve macroeconomic and
exchange rate stability. Box 10 provides an
overview of the characteristics of ERM II.Participation in ERM II has not been associatedwith tensions in the foreign exchange marketsTable 9 Balance of payments of the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area(as a percentage of GDP)Current account plus capital account balanceNet foreign direct investment flows

2004Box 10MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM II
With the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, the exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II)replaced the European Monetary System (and its exchange rate mechanism component) which
had been in operation since 1979. ERM II is a multilateral arrangement of fixed but adjustable
exchange rates, with bilateral central rates between the euro and participating currencies, and a
standard fluctuation band of ±15% around those central rates.Participation in ERM II for at least two years without severe tensions prior to the examinationof economic convergence is a requirement for fulfilling the exchange rate criterion of the
Maastricht convergence criteria that must be met in order to adopt the euro. The economic
rationale behind this requirement is that it helps Member States outside the euro area to orient
their policies towards stability and enhances the prospects of achieving a lasting convergenceof economic fundamentals.This reflects the notion that economic conditions and policies of participating Member Statesshould be consistent with the preservation of the central rates set. The overall goal of this
process is to foster macroeconomic stability in the new EU Member States, thereby providing
the best possible contribution to sustainable growth and real convergence. Moreover, soundmacroeconomic policies and stable exchange rates are supportive of a smooth functioning ofthe internal market.According to the Governing Council, the mechanism, as well as the policy orientation required
for participation, is designed to help Member States outside the euro area in their efforts to
adopt the euro, while dealing with the complex relationship between economic fundamentalsand exchange rate stability.1The mechanism foresees a range of policy instruments that may be combined to addressmarket pressures: interest rate measures, flexibility of the exchange rate within the band,
interventions, and possible realignments of the central rate.From an operational perspective, decisions concerning central rates and the standardfluctuation band are taken by mutual agreement of the ministers of the individual euro area
countries, the ECB and the ministers and central bank governors of the non-euro area EU
Member States participating in the mechanism. The General Council is responsible for
monitoring the functioning of ERM II and serves as the forum for monetary and exchange rate
cooperation. It closely monitors, on a permanent basis, the sustainability of the bilateralexchange rate between each participating currency and the euro.1See also ﬁPolicy position of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank on exchange rate issues relating to the accedi

at or close to their central rates, while short-
term interest rate differentials vis-à-vis theeuro area have been small in most countries(see Table 10). In the context of ERM II entry,
Banka Slovenije smoothly discontinued the
gradual trend depreciation of the Slovenian
tolar against the euro.Most of the currencies of the non-euro area EUMember States experienced a strengtheningagainst the euro in 2004 and also a marked
appreciation on a trade-weighted basis. The
weakening of the euro was particularly
pronounced against the currencies of several of
the larger new EU Member States, amid arelatively favourable growth outlook for thesecountries (see Chart 32). The Polish zlotyexperienced the largest appreciation against the
euro in 2004, followed by the Czech koruna, the
Slovak koruna and the Hungarian forint. By
contrast, the Latvian lats, which in 2004 waspartially linked through its exchange rate regimeto the US dollar, depreciated against the euro.
Since the beginning of 2005 Latvia has changed
the peg of the lats from the special drawing
right (SDR) currency basket to the euro, at
LVL 0.702804 per euro. Since the re-pegging,
the lats has fluctuated within a narrow bandaround its peg rate. The Swedish krona, theMaltese lira and the Cyprus pound were
relatively stable against the euro. The pound
sterling appreciated somewhat against the euro
in early 2004 amid a favourable outlook for the
UK economy and rising interest rates. In thesecond half of the year, however, it depreciatedvis-à-vis the euro.MONETARY POLICY
The primary objective for monetary policy in
all non-euro area EU Member States is pricestability. Monetary policy strategies differ to agreat extent from country to country, reflecting
the heterogeneity among them in nominal, real
and structural terms (see Table 11). During
2004 the monetary policy and exchange rate
regimes in the non-euro area EU MemberStates remained largely unchanged, althoughsome refinements were made to the monetary
policy frameworks of several countries with a
view to gearing monetary policy more towards
future monetary integration. In particular,
Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia joined ERM IIon 28 June 2004. Moreover, in Latvia, LatvijasChart 32 Exchange rate changes of the euroagainst EU currencies outside ERM II(in percentages)Source: ECB.

2004requirement of 2% for deposits in foreigncurrency was introduced. In Latvia the central
bank increased its key policy rate by 100 basis
points to 4%. To contain risks stemming from
high economic growth, strong credit growthand a widening current account deficit, italso decided to increase minimum reserve
requirements from 3% to 4% and to expand the
base for minimum reserves by including bank
liabilities to foreign banks and foreign central
banks with an agreed maturity or redeemable ata period of notice of up to two years. In Maltathe official interest rate remained unchanged at
3% throughout 2004.Turning to the non-euro area EU MemberStates with an inflation targeting framework inplace, the Czech Republic and Polandincreased interest rates in 2004 with a view to
containing inflationary pressures and limiting
possible second-round effects of higher
inflation rates. In the Czech Republic the key
policy rate was increased by 50 basis points to
2.5% Œ although it was lowered to 2.25% inJanuary 2005 Œ and in Poland the key rate wasraised by 125 basis points to 6.5%. In the
United Kingdom, the repo rate was raised by
100 basis points to 4.75%, mainly due to a
worsened outlook for CPI inflation. In contrast,
Hungary, which follows an inflation targetcombined with an exchange rate constraint,reduced interest rates by a total of 300 basis
points to 9.5% in 2004, and further to 8.25% in
February 2005. The gradual interest rate cuts
throughout 2004 reversed the one-off 300 basis
point increase that had taken place inNovember 2003 after a sudden deterioration ofinvestor confidence. The reversal was made
possible by the easing of short-term risk
perceptions, an improvement in the inflation
outlook and relatively subdued developments
in private sector wage growth. In Slovakiaappreciation pressures on the koruna were themain motivation for a reduction in the key
interest rate by a total of 200 basis points to
4%. In Sweden limited inflationary pressure
supported the reduction of interest rates by
75 basis points to 2%.FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSIn 2004 long-term bond yield developments
were mixed in non-euro area EU Member
States. Long-term interest rates, as measured
by the ten-year benchmark government bondyield, increased in Cyprus, the Czech Republicand Poland, but towards the end of 2004 started
to decline again. As a result, bond yield spreads
vis-à-vis the euro area increased in these
countries. In Hungary long-term bond yields
were relatively volatile, with a downward trendin the second half of 2004, while in Latvia,Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia, long-term
interest rates continued to decline in the course
of 2004, narrowing the spread vis-à-vis the
euro area, in particular in the countries
participating in ERM II. In Malta long-terminterest rates were stable, while in Denmark,Sweden and the United Kingdom they moved in
parallel with the rates in the euro area as
indicated by stable bond yield spreads.5Stock markets in the non-euro area EU Member
States continued to perform favourably in2004, with some of the stock market indices,especially those of most of the new Member
States, reaching all-time highs and recording
annual increases in a range between 20% and
80%. Stock markets in all the new Member
States, with the exception of Cyprus,significantly outperformed euro area stockprices, as measured by the Dow Jones EURO

STOXX index. Stock markets in Denmark,

Sweden and the United Kingdom continued to
follow broadly the development of the Dow
Jones EURO STOXX index, with the first two
countries slightly outperforming and the lastone slightly underperforming the euro area
benchmark.5Estonia does not have a developed market for long-term bonds
denominated in domestic currency. A proxy indicator for long-
term interest rates in Estonia, developed jointly by the European

Commission, the ECB and Eesti Pank and based on a weighted

average of interest rates for new business loans denominated in

domestic currency with maturities of over five years, shows a

downward trend during 2004.

20041MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS, FOREIGN
EXCHANGE OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENT
ACTIVITIES1.1MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS
The key operational task of the Eurosystem isthe implementation of monetary policy. The
operational framework which the Eurosystemhas set up for this purpose consists of threecategories of instruments: open market
operations, standing facilities and the
minimum reserve system. All credit operations
carried out by the Eurosystem have to be
covered by adequate collateral provided bycounterparties.1 The Eurosystem took majorsteps in 2004 towards the establishment of asingle list of collateral.INITIAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEW

FRAMEWORK FOR MONETARY POLICY
IMPLEMENTATION
The operational framework continued to workwell in 2004, delivering stable short-term
money market rates and clearly signalling the
monetary policy stance. In order to further
improve the implementation of monetary
policy, two important changes to theframework were introduced on 9 March 2004.ŒThe timing of the reserve maintenance
periods was adjusted so that these periodsalways start on the settlement day of
the main refinancing operation (MRO)following the Governing Council meeting atwhich the monthly decision on the monetary
policy stance is scheduled. Previously,
reserve maintenance periods started on
the 24th calendar day of one month and
ended on the 23rd calendar day of thesubsequent month, irrespective of theGoverning Council™s meeting schedule. As
a complement, changes in the standing
facility rates are now implemented, as a rule,
on the first day of the new maintenance
period. Previously, these changes tookeffect on the day after the GoverningCouncil™s meeting.ŒThe maturity of the MROs was shortened
from two weeks to one week. Together with
the above-mentioned changes, this meansthat MROs settled in one reservemaintenance period no longer extend intothe subsequent reserve maintenance period.These changes were designed to align the
reserve maintenance period with the cyclefor interest rate decision-making, ensuringthat, as a rule, changes in key ECB interest
rates only take effect at the beginning of the
subsequent reserve maintenance period. The
ECB thereby aims to eliminate expectations
of changes in the key ECB interest rateswithin a maintenance period and thus stabilisemarket participants™ bidding behaviour in
the MRO. Previously, such expectations
have occasionally destabilised counterparties™
bidding in the MROs. In particular, when
there were expectations of imminent interestrate reductions, counterparties bid for lessliquidity than the ECB intended to allot.
This phenomenon, known as underbidding,
reflected counterparties™ attempts to fulfil
their reserve requirements at the lowest
possible cost, i.e. after a potential interest rate
reduction.Moreover, communication to counterpartieswas enhanced. On MRO announcement days,
the ECB continues to publish the forecast of the
autonomous liquidity factors which are not
under the direct control of the ECB™s liquiditymanagement, such as banknotes in circulation,government deposits and net foreign assets. In
addition, the ECB has started to publish an
updated forecast on the allotment day. The
ECB now also communicates the benchmark
amount on both the announcement and theallotment day. The benchmark amount is theallotment amount that allows the euro area
banking system as a whole to smoothly fulfil its
reserve requirements, given the Eurosystem™s
complete liquidity forecast, i.e. including
autonomous factors and excess reserves. Thisimproved communication makes explicitlyclear to the market whether the ECB™s1A detailed description of the operational framework can be
found in the ECB publication entitled ﬁThe implementation of
monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on

Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and proceduresﬂ,

83ECBAnnualReport
2004allotment decisions in MROs aim to balanceliquidity conditions or not.The implementation of the changes to theframework was smooth. The shortening of theMRO maturity from two weeks to one week andthe elimination of the overlap between
operations led to an immediate doubling in size
of each MRO. Counterparties™ bidding
behaviour adapted quickly to the strong
increase in the average allotment amount,although in the third MRO with a maturity ofone week, the total amount of bids fell short of
the benchmark amount by 5 billion. The totalMRO bid amount quickly increased thereafter
to levels steadily above the allotment amount,
standing in November 2004 at an all-time highof around 384 billion (see Chart 33). Overall,the bid-cover ratio, which is the ratio ofsubmitted bids to satisfied bids, has been
sound, ranging almost consistently between
1.20 and 1.50 since March 2004. The smooth
adaptation of market participants™ bid volumes
also indicates that the larger turnover ofcollateral implied by the shortening of theMRO maturity was managed well by credit
institutions.Since the changes to the framework came intoeffect, the short-term fluctuations in theallotment amount have decreased. From June2000 to March 2004 the average weekly change
in the allotment amounted to 33 billion, whilethis figure fell to 7 billion in the periodbetween the implementation of the changes and
December 2004. This reduction can beattributed to the fact that the MRO maturity isnow always aligned with the time horizon of
the liquidity targeted by the ECB in its
allotment. As a further consequence, the
reduction in the short-term fluctuation of the
allotment amount has contributed to astabilisation of credit institutions™ bidding inthe MROs.Approximately 2,100 credit institutions in theeuro area are eligible to participate in the
MROs. The average number of bidders inMROs increased from 266 in 2003 to 339 in2004, thus reversing the declining trendobserved since 1999. In the period from March
to December 2004, i.e. after the changes to the
framework were implemented, the average
number of bidders reached 351. This increase is
probably primarily the consequence of the
reduction in the maturity of the MROs from twoweeks to one week, which implies that banksnow need to submit a bid each week instead of
every second week in order to satisfy their
liquidity needs. However, it is possible that the
increased transparency and simplicity of the
new framework have made it easier forcounterparties to prepare their bids and havetherefore also facilitated increased
participation in tenders.Overall, the volatility of the EONIA declinedin 2004. The standard deviation of the spreadbetween the EONIA and the minimum bid rateof the MRO was 9 basis points in 2004, against
16 basis points in 2003 and 13 basis points in
2002. However, significant volatility has been
observed in the spread after the settlement of
the last MRO of some maintenance periods.This is a result of the fact that the allotment ofthe last MRO now usually takes place eight
days before the end of the reserve maintenance
period, while previously the timing of the last
allotment varied from month to month between
eight and two days before the end of the reservemaintenance period. The closer the underlyingChart 33 Bid and allotment amounts inweekly MROs in 2004(EUR billions)Source: ECB.

2004forecast is to the end of the reservemaintenance period, the more accurate it is.
Therefore, the changes to the framework lead to
an increased likelihood of substantial liquidity
imbalances accumulating after the allotment ofthe last MRO of a reserve maintenance periodand, thus, of the overnight rate deviating from
the minimum bid rate earlier and more
substantially than in the past.The ECB™s enhanced communication policyhelps to mitigate this risk to some extent as itmakes it somewhat easier for market
participants to detect a given liquidity
imbalance since the last MRO allotment of the
maintenance period. However, some evidence
emerged in particular during the autumn of2004 that excessive volatility in the overnightrate at the end of the maintenance period can
have a somewhat disruptive effect on the
smooth functioning of the money market. As
the ECB aims to establish neutral liquidity
conditions in the overnight market, it
responded to these developments, carrying outfine-tuning operations on the last day of fivemaintenance periods with a view to offsetting
expected undesirable liquidity imbalances
which mainly resulted from changes in the
Eurosystem™s forecast of autonomous factors.
Two operations were liquidity-absorbing(11 May and 7 December 2004) and threewere liquidity-providing (8 November 2004,
18 January and 7 February 2005). These
operations were successful in restoring neutral
liquidity conditions at the end of the respective
maintenance periods.The changes to the operational framework alsohad implications for the conduct of longer-term
refinancing operations (LTROs). In order to
minimise disruption to the timetable of LTROs,
the technical link between the maintenanceperiods and the allotment days of LTROs hasbeen discontinued. As of 26 February 2004
LTROs are normally allotted on the last
Wednesday of the month (instead of the first
Wednesday of the maintenance period). In
contrast to the MROs, LTROs Œ which have amonthly frequency and a maturity of normallyChart 34 Liquidity factors and thedevelopment of banknotes in the euroarea in 2004(EUR billions)Source: ECB.

2004three months Œ are not used for signalling theGoverning Council™s monetary policy stance
and are conducted as pure variable rate tenders
with a pre-announced allotment volume. On
average, LTROs accounted for around 23% ofthe total net liquidity provided through openmarket operations in 2004. In view of the
higher liquidity needs anticipated for the euro
area banking system, the LTRO allotment
volume was increased from 20 to 25 billionin January 2004 and from 25 to 30 billion inJanuary 2005.DEVELOPMENT OF LIQUIDITY NEEDSIn order to prepare its weekly tenders, the ECB
monitors on a daily basis the liquidity needs of
the euro area banking system, which aredefined as the sum of reserve requirementsimposed on banks, excess reserves (funds held
by credit institutions in excess of the reserve
requirements) and net autonomous factors. The
daily average liquidity needs of the euro area
banking system amounted to 311.8 billionin 2004, representing a 30% increase bycomparison with 2003, when they stood at241.5 billion (see upper part of Chart 34).During 2004 net autonomous factors continued
to grow strongly, averaging 174.2 billion ascompared with 109.3 billion in 2003. Thissteep rise was almost exclusively due to the
continued strong growth in banknotes, whichincreased at an annual rate of almost 15% in2004, reaching an all-time high of 505 billionon 24 December 2004 (see lower part of
Chart 34).The minimum reserves that euro area creditinstitutions must hold with the Eurosystem arecalculated by applying the 2% reserve ratio to
the credit institutions™ reserve base. In 2004
reserve requirements represented 44% of the
total liquidity needs of the euro area banking
system. The average level of aggregaterequired reserves held by credit institutionsin the euro area increased from 130.9 billionin 2003 to 136.5 billion in 2004 in linewith the expansion of the reserve base. Credit
institutions™ average current account holdings
in excess of their average reserve requirements
stood at 0.6 billion in 2004, compared with0.7 billion in 2003.Source: ECB.

2004ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR MONETARY POLICY
OPERATIONS
With the aim of protecting the Eurosystem from
incurring losses, all Eurosystem credit
operations are required to be based on adequatecollateral. The range of assets accepted ascollateral is broad. The bulk consists of
marketable debt instruments which fulfil euro
area-wide eligibility criteria and are referred to
as ﬁtier oneﬂ assets. ﬁTier twoﬂ consists of
additional assets, marketable and non-marketable, which have been of particularimportance to national financial markets and
banking systems.The average value of marketable collateraleligible for Eurosystem credit operationsstood at 7.7 trillion in 2004, compared with7.1 trillion in 2003 (see Chart 35). Themajority of marketable assets took the formof government securities (54%) or covered
(i.e. Pfandbrief-style securities) and uncovered
bonds issued by credit institutions (28%). In
addition, strong growth has been observed inasset-backed securities, which represented 5%of outstanding marketable collateral at the end
of 2004. The average value of marketable
assets used by counterparties as collateral
against Eurosystem credit operations stood
at 787 billion in 2004, compared with704 billion in 2003 (see Chart 36). Relativeto the overall eligible amount, government
issues and corporate securities were under-
proportionally used as collateral in credit
operations with the Eurosystem. Conversely,
credit institution issues and asset-backedsecurities were over-proportionally used. Forinformation on the use of eligible assets across
national borders, see Section 2 of this chapter.TOWARDS A SINGLE LIST OF COLLATERAL
The Eurosystem™s present two-tier collateralsystem has contributed to a smooth functioningof the operational framework of the
Eurosystem in the first years of its existence.
However, against the background of increasing
financial market integration in the euro area,
the heterogeneity of the assets included in thetier two lists of different euro area NCBs mayundermine the level playing-field forcounterparties and reduce the transparency of
the collateral framework. Moreover, demand
for collateral is on an upward trend, not least on
account of the fact that the liquidity deficit ofthe banking sector increased in the course of2004. The trend in private interbank markets
towards secured lending has also augmented
counterparties™ needs for collateral.
To address these issues, the Eurosystemdecided to establish over time a single list ofcollateral eligible for all Eurosystem credit
operations, taking into account the results of a
public consultation. This single list will be
introduced gradually and will eventually
replace the current two-tier system. The firststep towards establishing the single list willcome into force on 30 May 2005. It consists of
three elements:ŒThe inclusion in tier one of new instruments
that are currently ineligible, namely euro-denominated debt instruments issued byentities established in those G10 countriesthat are not part of the EEA (United States,
Canada, Japan and Switzerland).ŒDebt instruments which are only listed or
quoted on non-regulated markets willbecome or remain eligible if the respectivenon-regulated market has been positively
assessed by the Eurosystem against the three
standards of safety, transparency and
accessibility. These standards have been
introduced to broaden the number ofacceptable markets while at the same timeensuring the smooth and efficient
assessment of Eurosystem collateral.ŒA very limited number of marketable debt
securities will lose their eligibility statusand will be phased out over time. Inaddition, equities have been withdrawn from
the list of tier two assets.As a second step towards a single list of
collateral, the Governing Council has approvedin principle the inclusion in the single list of87ECBAnnualReport
2004bank loans from all euro area countries, as wellas non-marketable retail mortgage-backed debtinstruments, which currently only include Irish
mortgage-backed promissory notes. The main
reason for accepting bank loans is that, despite
the increasing role of capital markets, the
financial system of the euro area still relies to a
large extent on bank intermediation, with bankloans remaining the most important asset classon banks™ balance sheets. By accepting bank
loans as collateral, the Eurosystem reaffirms its
preference for ensuring broad access for
counterparties to monetary policy and intraday
credit operations.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESRisk management in the context of the
Eurosystem™s policy operations (i.e. monetary
policy or payment systems credit operations)
focuses mainly on the credit risk theEurosystem incurs when providing centralbank funds to a counterparty, although other
types of risk are also taken into account.Extensive analysis was carried out in 2004 onthe inclusion of bank loans in the single list ofcollateral. Since corporate loan issuers areoften unrated, alternative credit quality
assessment sources for bank loans will need to
be used. While those NCBs that already accept
bank loans as tier two collateral have
established in-house credit assessmentsystems, additional sources of creditassessment for bank loans will need to be
established once bank loans are included inthe single list for the whole Eurosystem.
The development and implementation of a
consistent and efficient Eurosystem credit
assessment framework for marketable and, in
particular, non-marketable assets is expected
to represent a major challenge over the comingyears.1.2FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS
In 2004 the ECB did not undertake any
interventions in the foreign exchange marketfor policy reasons. Its foreign exchange
transactions were exclusively related to
investment activity. Furthermore, the ECB did
not undertake any foreign exchange operations
in the non-euro area currencies that participatein ERM II.The standing agreement between the ECB andthe IMF to facilitate the initiation of special
drawing rights (SDR) transactions by the IMF
on behalf of the ECB with other SDR holderswas activated on four occasions in 2004.88ECBAnnualReport
20041.3INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENT
The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio iscomposed of foreign reserve contributionsfrom the euro area NCBs. Its purpose is to fundthe ECB™s operations in the foreign exchange
market. In particular, the ECB holds the part of
the Eurosystem™s reserves that can be used
directly and without delay to fund foreign
exchange interventions, and it can make furthercalls on the NCBs™ foreign reserves in case itneeds to replenish its depleted holdings.The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio mainlyconsists of US dollars, but also includes
Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. In line with theCentral Bank Gold Agreement of 26 September1999, renewed on 8 March 2004, gold holdings
were not actively managed in 2004. The value
of the ECB™s net foreign reserve assets
declined from 38.3 billion to 36.3 billionduring 2004, mainly due to the depreciation of
the US dollar against the euro.Each euro area NCB currently manages aportion of both the ECB™s US dollar and yen
portfolios. The Eurosystem reviewed this
structure in 2004 with the objective of
maintaining its effectiveness, particularly inview of the future enlargement of the euro area.The new system, currently being finalised, will
be implemented in 2006 and will entail
specialisation among Eurosystem members in
terms of the currency denomination of the
managed portfolios, with due respect to theprinciple of decentralisation.During 2004 work began on expanding theinvestment universe to include interest rate
swaps, currency-hedged instruments and US
STRIPs2. In addition, quantitative forecastingmodels for government bond yields increased
the sophistication of the analysis of market
developments. Finally, a pilot exercise, due to
start in 2005, was devised for an automatic
securities lending programme in the US dollar
portfolio.2STRIP stands for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and
Principal, which is a security created by separating the bond
principal from the interest payments in a US government bond.
OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENT
The ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of thepaid-up share of the subscribed capital and the
general reserve fund. The purpose of this
portfolio is to provide the ECB with a reserve tomeet possible losses. The objective of itsmanagement is to generate returns over the
long term in excess of the average main
refinancing rate of the ECB. In 2004 the
investment options of the own funds portfolio
were expanded by adding euro-denominatedfixed-income securities issued by some newMember States, some euro area regional
government bonds and more covered bonds.In 2004 the ECB™s own funds portfolio grew by0.3 billion to 6.2 billion. In particular, thepaid-up capital portion increased by 63.5million due to EU enlargement and changes in
the ECB™s capital key.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESWhen managing its investment portfolios
(foreign reserves and own funds), the ECB isexposed to financial risks. In order to managethese risks, the ECB defines a framework that
reflects its preferences regarding credit,
liquidity and market risk. This framework is
implemented, inter alia, via a detailed limits
system, whereby compliance is monitored andverified on a daily basis. With a view to thefuture enlargement of the euro area, work was
conducted in 2004 with the aim of simplifying
the credit and market risk framework.89ECBAnnualReport
20042PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT
SYSTEMS
The Eurosystem has the statutory task ofpromoting the smooth operation of payment
systems. Its main instrument for carrying out
this task Œ besides the oversight function Œ is
the provision of payment and securitiessettlement facilities. To this end, theEurosystem has created the Trans-European
Automated Real-time Gross settlement
Express Transfer system, known as TARGET,
for large-value payments in euro. It has been
subject to enhancements over the past fewyears, and work is under way to develop asecond-generation system, TARGET2. On the
securities settlement side, the Eurosystem and
the market offer a number of channels to
facilitate the use of collateral across national
borders.2.1THE TARGET SYSTEM
The present TARGET system is a ﬁsystem of
systemsﬂ made up of the national payment
systems of the 15 countries that were membersof the EU at TARGET™s launch, the ECBpayment mechanism (EPM) and an interlinking
mechanism that enables the processing of
payments between the linked systems. In 2004
TARGET contributed further to the integration
of the euro money market and, because theEurosystem™s credit operations are processedvia this system, continued to play an important
role in the smooth implementation of the single
monetary policy. On account of its real-time
settlement service in central bank money and
its broad market coverage, the TARGETsystem also attracts a variety of otherpayments.TARGET functioned smoothly and successfullyin 2004 and continued its trend of settling
an increasing number of large-value europayments. This is in line with the Eurosystem™spolicy objective of promoting settlement in
central bank money as a uniquely safe means
of payment. In 2004 88% of the total turnover

of large-value payments in euro was executed
via TARGET. TARGET is available for allcredit transfers in euro between banks locatedin any of the Member States whose NCBs arelinked, directly or indirectly, to TARGET.
Such transfers may be made both between
banks in the same Member State (intra-Member
State traffic) and between those in differentMember States (inter-Member State traffic).The latest survey in 2004 revealed that
there were 10,483 participants in TARGET.
This is about three times higher than the
figure for 2002 and mainly reflects the
introduction of a new methodology fordefining TARGET participants. Overall, around48,500 institutions, in particular branches
of participants, can be addressed through
TARGET using a Bank Identifier Code.TARGET OPERATIONS
In 2004 TARGET processed a daily average of
267,234 payments with a total value of 1,714
billion a day. Compared with 2003, this is an
increase of 2% in volume and 4% in value.Of the total TARGET traffic in 2004, inter-Member State traffic represented 33% in termsof value and 24% in terms of volume, comparedwith 33% and 23% respectively in 2003. Of
that inter-Member State traffic, 95% in terms
of value and 49% in terms of volume were
interbank payments, the remainder being
customer payments. The average value of aninter-Member State interbank payment was17 million, and the average value of aninter-Member State customer payment was
0.8 million. Further information on paymenttraffic is provided in Table 12.In 2004 the overall availability of TARGET,i.e. the extent to which participants were able
to use TARGET during its business hours
without incident, reached 99.81%. On average,
95.87% of inter-Member State payments were
processed within five minutes. Furtherinformation is provided in Table 13.Throughout 2004 the mandatory changesnecessary for the migration to the new
messaging system, SWIFTNet FIN, continued,
and all components of TARGET migratedsuccessfully.90ECBAnnualReport
2004PROVISIONS FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT
PAYMENTS IN TARGET
Owing to the TARGET system™s pivotal role in
the market and its broad market coverage,
suitable protection against a wide range of
threats is essential for the reliable andsmooth functioning of the system. It is ofthe utmost importance that systemically
important payments Œ i.e. those that could
cause a systemic risk if not processed when
due Œ be carried out without delay, even in
abnormal circumstances. The Eurosystem hasestablished contingency measures to ensurethat such payments are processed in an orderly
manner, even in the event of TARGET
malfunctioning. In 2004 a number of trials
were carried out by central banks (often
involving commercial banks), and these provedthe effectiveness of the TARGET contingencymeasures. They confirmed that the Eurosystem
is in a good position to ensure that payment
systems and financial markets can continue to
function smoothly in a crisis situation.TARGET CONNECTION FOR THE NEW EU MEMBER

STATES
In October 2002 the Governing Council
decided that, following EU enlargement, the
Eurosystem would connect the real-time gross
settlement (RTGS) systems of the NCBs of thenew Member States to TARGET at theirrequest. Given the limited remaining lifetime
of the current TARGET system and in order to
save costs, the Eurosystem developed
alternatives to full integration which allow
the new Member States™ RTGS systems tobe connected to the current TARGET system.For instance, the solution envisaged for
SORBNET-EURO, Narodowy Bank Polski™s
euro RTGS system, is a connection via a
current euro area NCB. The connection will be
provided in 2005 through the Banca d™Italia.RELATIONS WITH TARGET USERS AND REAL-TIME

2004an appropriate response. In 2004, as inprevious years, regular meetings were held
between the 15 NCBs linked to TARGET and
the national TARGET user groups. In addition,
joint meetings of the TARGET ManagementWorking Group of the ESCB and the TARGETWorking Group of the European banking
industry were held to discuss TARGET
operational issues. Strategic issues were
addressed in the Contact Group on Euro
Payments Strategy, a forum in which the seniormanagement of commercial and central banksis represented.The Eurosystem, as operator of one of thelargest RTGS systems in the world, maintains
close contacts with the RTGS operators ofother currency areas. Increasing interrelations,such as those stemming from Continuous
Linked Settlement operations, have created the
need for joint discussions on operational
issues.2.2TARGET2
In December 2004 the Governing Council
accepted the joint offer made by the Banca
d™Italia, the Deutsche Bundesbank and the
Banque de France to build the single sharedplatform for TARGET2 and to develop andoperate it on behalf of the Eurosystem. This
decision will result in a fundamental redesign
of the architecture of TARGET, which, at
present, consists of multiple interlinked RTGS
systems which are maintained by the NCBs andthe ECB. TARGET2 will offer TARGET usersa higher level of service and will allow
economies of scale to be made.The main preparatory work undertaken in 2004for TARGET2 involved developing thefunctional specifications. This work wasundertaken in close cooperation with TARGET
users. The General Functional Specifications
(GFS) for TARGET2, which were approved by
the Governing Council in July 2004, describe
on a general level the features and functions ofthe system as well as its IT architecture.TARGET2 will offer comprehensive liquidity
management functions that allow creditinstitutions to better control their euro
liquidity. For example, a participant that uses
several payment and securities settlement
systems settling in central bank money will
have the possibility of settling all such
positions from a single RTGS account inTARGET2. Furthermore, for RTGS accountsof euro area credit institutions held with euro
area central banks, TARGET2 will offer an
intraday liquidity pooling feature. It will
enable euro area TARGET2 participants to
group individual RTGS accounts held withdifferent euro area central banks and to poolthe available intraday liquidity for the benefit
of all members of the group of accounts.
The Eurosystem is working towards the
establishment of a robust legal framework for
this purpose, which is a precondition foroffering this function. TARGET2 will be basedon a state-of-the-art business continuity
concept that will enable it to cope with wide-
scale regional disaster situations.On the basis of the GFS, the Eurosystem ispreparing the User Detailed FunctionalSpecifications (UDFS), which describe the
features and functions of TARGET2 at the
level of detail required for the start of the
technical development and implementation
work. As was the case for the GFS, the UDFShave been intensively discussed with TARGET92ECBAnnualReport
2004users. The UDFS are expected to be finalised inApril 2005.The Eurosystem is also developing a pricingscheme for the TARGET2 core service which
will eliminate the current differences in pricing
between domestic and cross-border
transactions. It includes an option to be decided
on by the Governing Council which wouldallow participants to choose between paying atransaction fee only or a lower transaction fee
plus a periodical fee. Further details of the
TARGET2 pricing scheme will be defined in
2005.Another major area of work in 2004 was thedevelopment of the governance structure for
TARGET2 and, on the basis of this, an
effective project organisation for the next
project phases (development, testing and
migration). The Governing Council approved
internal rules concerning the commongovernance of TARGET2. These define theroles and responsibilities in the TARGET2
project of, respectively, the Governing
Council, the full group of euro area central
banks and the three NCBs building and
operating the system. The chosen governancestructure and project organisation will ensureboth the effective organisation of the
development work in the project phase and an
appropriate level of continued involvement and
control by all euro area central banks after the
launch of TARGET2.The development of software and theestablishment of the IT infrastructure for
TARGET2 will be carried out in 2005. First
testing activities with the central banks are
planned to start in early 2006. TARGET userswill migrate to TARGET2 in different wavesand on different predefined dates. Each wave
will consist of a group of national banking
communities and the migration process will be
spread over several months, during which
current TARGET components and the newsystem will coexist. The phased migration willbe organised in a way which minimises project
risk. Other important considerations whendeciding on the concrete migration process will
be to minimise potential transition problems
and costs for central banks and TARGET users.
It is planned that the first group of countries
will migrate to TARGET2 on 2 January 2007.The Eurosystem will continue its closecooperation with the TARGET user community
during all phases of the project and will report
regularly on the progress made.2.3CROSS-BORDER USE OF COLLATERAL
Eligible assets may be used across national
borders to collateralise all types of Eurosystem
credit operation by means of the correspondent
central banking model (CCBM) or througheligible links between EU securities settlementsystems (SSSs). The CCBM is provided by the
Eurosystem, while eligible links are a market-
led solution.The amount of cross-border collateral held bythe Eurosystem increased from 305 billion inDecember 2003 to 370 billion in December2004. Overall, at the end of 2004 cross-border
collateral represented 43.89% of the total
collateral provided to the Eurosystem. These
figures confirm the trend observed in previous
years of increasing integration of financialmarkets in the euro area and the growingwillingness of counterparties to hold in their
portfolios assets issued in another euro area
country.THE CORRESPONDENT CENTRAL BANKING MODELThe CCBM has remained the main channel
for transferring cross-border collateral. It
accounted for 35.37% of the total collateral
provided to the Eurosystem in 2004. Assets
held in custody through the CCBM increased
from 259 billion at the end of 2003 to 298billion at the end of 2004.By the beginning of 2004 NCBs had, as aresult of enhancements made in 2003,
already achieved the objective of performing
internal CCBM procedures within an hour,provided that counterparties (and their93ECBAnnualReport
2004custodians) submitted their instructionscorrectly. The Eurosystem is investigating
further improvements and alternatives for
the efficient and safe use of cross-border
collateral.Custodian banks often play an important role inthe CCBM processing chain by delivering
collateral on behalf of counterparties. In
January 2004 ﬁbest practicesﬂ for custodian
banks involved in CCBM transactions,established by the major European credit sectorassociations, were implemented. They aim to
optimise the efficiency of the CCBM. Market
participants™ efforts in implementing these best
practices also helped NCBs to perform internal
CCBM procedures within an hour. However,deviation from this one-hour benchmark mayoccur in certain circumstances, for instance in
the case of peak traffic.ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN SECURITIES
SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
SSSs can be linked by means of contractual andoperational arrangements to allow the cross-border transfer of eligible securities between
systems. Once eligible securities have been
transferred via such links to another SSS, they
can be used through local procedures in the
same way as any domestic collateral. There arecurrently 59 links available to counterparties,of which only a limited number are actively
used in transfers related to Eurosystem credit
operations. Furthermore, these links only
cover part of the euro area. Links become
eligible for Eurosystem credit operationsif they fulfil the Eurosystem™s nine userstandards3 which focus on the requirements ofcentral banks when settling their operations in
SSSs. The Eurosystem assesses any new links
or enhancements of eligible links against these
standards. In 2004 three existing eligible linkswere enhanced and positively assessed.3ﬁStandards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in
ESCB credit operationsﬂ, January 1998.
Collateral held through links increased from46 billion in December 2003 to 72 billion inDecember 2004, but represented only 8.5% of
the total collateral, cross-border and domestic,
held by the Eurosystem.94ECBAnnualReport
20043BANKNOTES AND COINS
3.1THE CIRCULATION OF BANKNOTES AND
COINSDEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINS
Following an annual growth rate of 22% in2003, the value of euro banknotes in circulationincreased by 15.0% in 2004, from 436.1 to501.3 billion. The number of euro banknotesin circulation increased by 6.8% (compared
with 10.1% in 2003), from 9.0 to 9.7 billion.
Chart 37 shows the development of nationalbanknotes and euro banknotes in circulationin terms of value between 2000 and 2004.
Chart 38 illustrates the development of the
number of euro banknotes in circulation since
their introduction.The value of banknotes in circulation has risenmore steeply than the number ever since
the cash changeover, which reflects the
particularly strong increase in the number of
high-denomination banknotes in circulation.
Chart 39 shows the development of euro
banknotes in circulation by denominationbetween 2002 and 2004. The strongest increasein demand in 2004 was for the 500 banknote,at 28.4%. Demand was also very strong for
the 50 and 100 banknotes, which sawcirculation growth rates of 12.4% and 13.5%
respectively.Overall growth in the number of 5, 10, 20and 200 banknotes in circulation has beenvery moderate since the introduction of the
banknotes in 2002, although developments
may vary between countries. Only duringseasonal peaks has a strong rise in demandbeen witnessed for the 10 and 20 banknotes,i.e. those denominations which are mainly used
for daily cash transactions. In the case of the
50 banknote, both fairly high growth andseasonal fluctuations have been recorded. Bycontrast, the circulation of the 5 and 100banknotes has shown only moderate seasonalvariation, while that of the 200 and 500banknotes has followed no seasonal pattern at
all. It is clear that demand for transaction
purposes within the euro area alone does notexplain the lasting upward trend in demand forthese denominations, but that other factors
must also play a role. One such factor seems
to be the growing international demand for
euro banknotes. Recent analyses suggest
that around 10% to 15% of the banknotes
in circulation are held outside the euro area.Another factor is hoarding by the public,partially influenced by the low level of interest
rates.During 2004 the value of euro coins incirculation (i.e. the net circulation excludingstocks held by NCBs) increased by 9.1%, from14.1 billion to 15.3 billion. The total numberChart 37 Total value of banknotes incirculation between 2000 and 2004(EUR billions)Source: ECB.

growth in the number of euro coins in
circulation since the beginning of 2003, when
the volume returned to the initial level of
40.4 billion coins issued at the time of the
changeover.BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEM
Deposits and withdrawals of euro banknotes
have been quite stable for all euro area NCBs
since the second quarter of 2002. Fluctuations
in the monthly deposits and withdrawalsmainly reflect the usual seasonal variations inbanknote demand.A total of 29.4 billion euro banknotes wereprocessed by euro area NCBs in 2004, which
was similar to the figure for 2003. BetweenJanuary and December 2004 a total of 30.4billion banknotes were issued and 29.7 billion
were returned to the NCBs. The return
frequency of banknotes, measured as the ratio
of banknotes deposited at NCBs to the number
of banknotes in circulation, has remainedrelatively stable since 2002 and in 2004 stoodat around 3.4 times a year. 3.8 billion unfit
banknotes were destroyed in 2004.3.2BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITING AND
COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCECOUNTERFEIT EURO BANKNOTES
Having risen steadily in 2002 and much of
2003, the rate of euro banknote counterfeiting
is now relatively stable. From the last quarterof 2003 to the end of 2004, an average ofaround 50,000 counterfeits were recovered
from circulation each month, with seasonal
fluctuations coinciding with those of genuine
banknotes, for example during holiday periods.
The total number of counterfeits received byNational Analysis Centres (NACs)4 in 2004was 594,000. This represents an increase of7.8% compared with 2003, which is
substantially lower than the growth rate

organised crime is increasingly targeting the100, 200 and 500 banknotes. A smallquantity of better than average counterfeitshave been produced in these denominations.Overall, it is evident that the number ofcounterfeits (594,000 in 2004) is a tiny fractionof the average number of genuine banknotes incirculation (8.9 billion in 2004). The public
can continue to have confidence in the security
of the euro: it remains a well protected
currency, in terms of both the sophistication
of its security features and the effectivenessof European and national law enforcementauthorities. However, the public should
continue to be watchful. The ﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ
test remains sufficient to detect counterfeits in
almost all cases.COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCEIn addition to cooperating with the NCBs,
Europol and the European Commission (in
particular the European Anti-Fraud Office,
OLAF), the ECB concluded an agreement
with Interpol in 2004 on the protection of the
euro and the fight against counterfeiting.Further cooperation agreements were establishedwith the central banks of two of the EU™sneighbouring countries (Ukraine and
Bulgaria), and similar agreements with other
countries are envisaged for the future. The
Eurosystem was active in training cash-handlingprofessionals, both in the EU and beyond, inrecognising and handling counterfeit banknotes.
The Counterfeit Analysis Centre at the ECB and
the NACs collaborated with the police in the fight
against counterfeiting, and technicians from the
NACs provided, upon request, legal authoritieswith expert advice and technical reports.The International Counterfeit DeterrenceCentre, hosted by the ECB, continued to
evaluate new reproduction equipment and
counterfeit deterrence systems and to supportthe Central Bank Counterfeit DeterrenceGroup, a joint initiative of 27 central banks
worldwide.3.3BANKNOTE ISSUANCE AND PRODUCTION

2004definition of its role and responsibilitieswill contribute to the establishment of the
Single Euro Payments Area (see Section 3
of Chapter 3). It also provides a reliable
framework for the Eurosystem™s partners in thecash cycle (i.e. the banking industry and cash-in-transit companies). In line with the principle
of decentralisation, the Governing Council
did not establish a fully harmonised system
for euro area cash services. While some
harmonisation and standardisation underthe guidance of the ECB is necessary, the NCBsare responsible for the implementation at
the national level, taking into account the
respective national economic environment and
banking structures, the existing NCB branch
network and the relative share of cashpayments and/or long-term agreements.ECB FRAMEWORK FOR THE DETECTION OF
COUNTERFEITS AND FITNESS SORTING
Following consultations with the banking and
cash-in-transit industries, in December 2004
the ECB adopted a framework for the detectionof counterfeits and the sorting of banknotes byquality (known as ﬁfitness sortingﬂ) by credit
institutions and other professional cash-
handlers. The principal objectives of this
framework are to implement a common policy
for banknote handling and processing by creditinstitutions and other professional cash-handlers as well as to provide them with
assistance in fulfilling their obligations
according to Article 6 of Council Regulation
(EC) No 1338/2001 regarding the detection and
withdrawal of counterfeit euro banknotes.NCBs will implement this framework withintheir jurisdiction by the end of 2006 at the
latest. There will be a two-year transition
period, ending no later than the end of 2007,
for the adaptation of procedures and existing
machines in operation by credit institutions andother professional cash-handlers.PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTS
A total of 1.6 billion banknotes were producedin 2004, compared with 3.1 billion in 2003.
This significant reduction in the 2004production requirement was primarily due to alower actual replacement need than expected in2003.Since 2002 the production of euro banknoteshas been allocated to the NCBs in accordancewith a decentralised production scenario with
pooling. Under this arrangement, each euro
area NCB is responsible for the procurement of
an allocated share of the total requirement for
certain denominations. Table 15 summarises
the 2004 production allocation.The arrangements for future banknoteprocurement are laid down in Guideline ECB/
2004/18, adopted by the Governing Council in
September 2004. The Guideline establishes a
single Eurosystem tender procedure for theproduction of euro banknotes, which will beimplemented by 1 January 2012 at the latest.
The implementation of this procedure will be
preceded by a transitional period, thus allowing
NCBs and the printing works ample time
to prepare for the new procedure. Thistransitional period will start no earlier than1 January 2008, but the precise starting date Œ
which will be decided by the Governing
Council Œ is dependent on the achievement of a
critical mass in terms of both the number of
NCBs agreeing to participate in the singleEurosystem tender procedure and the totalvolume of banknotes to be tendered.The Guideline has been developed inaccordance with the principle of an open

those printing works.VERY LOW-DENOMINATION BANKNOTES
In response to suggestions from various
sources, the Eurosystem examined the
potential positive and negative aspects of
introducing very low-denomination banknotes,
i.e. 1 and/or 2. After careful consideration,the Governing Council decided in November
2004 not to revise the decision it had taken in1998 on the denominations of euro banknotesand, consequently, not to issue 1 or 2banknotes. Having assessed all the arguments
put forward in the debate, the Governing
Council concluded that, on balance, the
negative aspects of introducing very low-denomination banknotes outweighed thepositive aspects. The insufficient demand for
very low-denomination banknotes by the
majority of euro area citizens, the increased
inefficiency which their introduction would
imply for most of the affected third parties Œ forinstance, the retail sector and the vendingmachine industry Œ and the high costs of
printing and processing contributed in
particular to this decision.99ECBAnnualReport
2004The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, collects a widerange of statistics which enable the ESCB
to fulfil its tasks. The necessary statistical
information is collected either from the
competent national authorities or directly fromeconomic agents. In 2004, as in previous years,the provision of statistics proceeded smoothly,
while work continued on further improving
the statistical framework and new statistics
became available in accordance with the ECB™s
medium-term strategy for statistics. The ECBalso held its second conference on statistics,this time focusing on their use for monetary and
economic policy-making.Some outstanding issues, mainly concerningthe reliability of data, remain in the field ofgovernment finance statistics, which areessential for the implementation of the
Stability and Growth Pact and the credibility
of budgetary surveillance. The European
Commission (Eurostat), assisted by national
statistical institutes (NSIs) and NCBs, where
applicable, is responsible for the provision ofthese statistics. The ECB makes intensive useof general economic statistics, most of which
are collected and compiled by Eurostat. The
provision of these statistics for the euro area
has further improved in some fields, for
example as regards the timeliness of quarterlyGDP data, the quality of the HICP flashestimate and the availability of short-term
business indicators. Taking into account
the developments in recent years, the ECB
published its review of the requirements in
the field of general economic statistics inDecember 2004.4.1FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE
STATISTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE EURO
AREANotwithstanding significant achievements
with regard to the statistical framework thus far
and the good quality of euro area statistics in
general, further improvements to the overall
statistical framework for the euro area remainnecessary. Ongoing economic transformation4STATISTICS
has to be accommodated in a forward-lookingmanner and some remaining statistical gaps
identified by users inside and outside the ECBhave to be filled where feasible. During 2004the ECB started work on further improving the
overall framework. Owing to the long lead
times involved in statistical projects, results
should be expected in the medium term.An important element of the statisticalframework for the euro area is the design andcompilation of a system of quarterly national
accounts by institutional sector, which the
Eurosystem is preparing together with Eurostat
and the NSIs. The sectors covered by this
system of accounts are households, non-financial corporations, financial corporations,government and the rest of the world. These
statistics will reveal the interrelationships
among these different sectors and between the
financial and non-financial transactions in the
economy. A sufficiently long time series ofsuch sector accounts, published soon after thereference period, makes it possible to trace
monetary policy impulses from the financial
sector to the non-financial sectors of the euro
area and, additionally, to better analyse the
impact of economic shocks on the euro area.Such a time series will also enable a widerrange of other analyses to be carried out.
Various key indicators which are essential for
business cycle analysis and for forecasting are
also embedded in the quarterly national
accounts by institutional sector.100ECBAnnualReport
2004The incorporation of International AccountingStandard 39 (IAS 39) on financial instruments
into EU law, which requires its use by all listed
companies as of 1 January 2005, has made it
necessary to amend the Regulation concerningthe consolidated balance sheet of the MFIsector (ECB/2001/13) in order to preserve the
conceptual basis of the monetary statistics. The
amending Regulation (ECB/2004/21), which
entered into force on 1 January 2005, ensures
that, irrespective of the specific form in whichIAS 39 is finally adopted, MFIs will continue toreport their stocks of loans and deposits at
nominal value, regardless of changes that may
be made to the EU legal accounting framework
after that date.4.2NEW OR ENHANCED STATISTICS
During 2004 the ECB started publishing some
new statistics that are relevant for monetary
policy and other ESCB tasks, for economic
policy in general, for market participants andfor the public at large.In spring 2004 the ECB, together with theEuropean Commission, for the first time
released monthly statistics on long-term
interest rates for the ten new EU MemberStates, which are necessary to assesstheir achievement of the high degree of
convergence required for entry into EMU.
Since June 2004 the ECB has also published
the monetary presentation of the euro area
balance of payments on a monthly basis. Inaddition, the ECB and Eurostat published areport on foreign direct investment, which
proposes improved methods for compiling such
statistics. Quarterly current account data of
the euro area balance of payments are now
available from 1980 onwards. With regard toeuro effective exchange rates, the trade weightsused for the computation of the indices have
been updated, the geographical coverage has
been enhanced and new series have been
published since September 2004. Statistics on
flows and stocks of euro area quoted shares arenow released on a monthly basis. The new
statistics include gross issues, redemptions
and outstanding amounts of all quoted shares
issued by euro area residents.In the framework of the ECOFIN Council™sAction Plan on EMU Statistical Requirements,
the ECB made available in 2004 a
comprehensive set of quarterly non-financial
and financial accounts for the government
sector. Work has already started on integratingthese statistics into the quarterly nationalaccounts by institutional sector.In 2004 the ECB also improved its legalframework to enable the publication of new
statistics in the future. The ECB Guideline andRecommendation on the statistical reportingrequirements in the field of balance of
payments and international investment
position statistics and the international
reserves template were revised. The ECB
started publishing enhanced statistics in this
field, including a geographical breakdown,in January 2005. Furthermore, the ECBpublished guidance notes on MFI balance sheetstatistics relating to EU enlargement. These
guidance notes aim to promote a clear and
consistent understanding of the requirements
and standards of Regulation ECB/2003/10.In 2004 efforts were made to improve thedissemination and accessibility of statistics.
Both the ECB™s redesigned Monthly Bulletin,
published for the first time in January 2004, and
the new version of the ECB™s website, whichwent live in June 2004, incorporate improvedstatistical sections.4.3GOVERNMENT FINANCE STATISTICS
During 2004 serious concerns arose about the
reliability of the statistics for budgetary
surveillance under the Treaty and the Stability
and Growth Pact. The ECB fully supported the
statement on good standards in statistics made
after the informal ECOFIN Council meeting in101ECBAnnualReport
2004Scheveningen on 11 September 2004. Thesestandards should reinforce the independence,
integrity and accountability of the NSIs. The
ECB is working closely with the European
Commission on this issue, in particular viathe Committee on Monetary, Financialand Balance of Payments Statistics, which
comprises senior statisticians from Eurostat,
the NSIs, the NCBs and the ECB. The
implementation of the ECB Guideline on
government finance statistics, adopted by theGoverning Council in February 2005, willfurther enhance the quality of euro area
government finance aggregates and will be
an additional step in establishing the quality
of and standards for a more complete set
of government finance data for fiscalsurveillance.102ECBAnnualReport
2004The objective of economic research at the ECBis to provide a strong conceptual and empirical
basis for policy-making. Economic research
within the Eurosystem thus focuses on
increasing knowledge of the functioning of theeuro area economy and providing analyses,models and other tools relevant to the conduct
of the ECB™s monetary policy and the
fulfilment of other tasks of the Eurosystem.Five years after its establishment the ECBasked three independent external experts toevaluate the economic research activities at the
ECB against high academic standards and to
assess the extent to which research conducted
at the ECB since 1998 has contributed to the
achievement of its objectives. The experts™report,5 which is available on the ECB™swebsite, gave a positive overall assessment ofthe research conducted at the ECB in terms of
scientific quality and value added, relevance
for the conduct of monetary policy and for the
other tasks and functions of the ECB, and
influence on the academic community and onother policy-making institutions. As requested5ECONOMIC RESEARCH
in their terms of reference, the evaluators alsomade a number of recommendations to further
improve research activities. Recommendations
were made in five areas: incentives for staff to
conduct high-quality research; long-termmanagement of human capital; coverage andcoordination of research activities in the
different ECB business areas; research
support; and communication and dissemination
of research. Many of the suggestions for
improvement coincided with the ECB™s ownassessment, and measures have been taken toimplement these improvements.5.1RESEARCH AGENDA
The research agenda in 2004 can be broken
down into six main areas: macroeconomics
and monetary economics; international
macroeconomics and finance; financial stability;
financial integration; the macroeconometric5M. Goodfriend, R. König and R. Repullo, ﬁExternal evaluation of the

2004modelling of the euro area; and generaleconomic and structural issues. Considerable
efforts were also directed towards research
on euro area enlargement and the economies
of the new EU Member States. In thiscontext, preparatory work for the subsequentenlargement of the euro area was carried out, in
particular with regard to the analytical tools
used for macroeconomic projections.Most of the results of the research activitiescarried out within or in cooperation with theECB were presented in the ECB™s Working
Paper series and Œ to a lesser extent Œ the ECB™s
Occasional Paper series, as well as at various
conferences and workshops. 126 ECB Working
Papers were published in 2004 (as comparedwith 97 in 2003). A considerable number of theWorking Papers released since the series was
launched in 1999 have already been published
or are forthcoming in academic journals (130)
or books (30). Given the long lags in
publication resulting from the peer review
process, this already significant proportion isexpected to increase in 2005. Chart 41illustrates the clear focus on policy-relevant
research at the ECB. It categorises ECB
Working Papers by topic, using the Journal
of Economic Literature classification types.
ﬁMacroeconomics and monetary economicsﬂis the most common topic covered inthe series, followed by ﬁmathematical and
quantitative methodsﬂ, ﬁfinancial economicsﬂ
and ﬁinternational economicsﬂ.Throughout 2004 the ECB hosted a number ofconferences and workshops, such as the thirdECB Central Banking Conference on ﬁThe
new EU Member States: convergence and
stabilityﬂ, which covered three main topics: the
economic and structural transformation of the
new EU Member States; international linksand the macroeconomic performance of thenew EU Member States; and macroeconomic
adjustment in these countries. Together with
the BIS and the G10 central banks, the ECB
has launched a new publication entitled the
ﬁInternational Journal of Central Bankingﬂ(see Chapter 6).5.2RESEARCH NETWORKS
ECB research is often conducted within theframework of organised networks. These are
groups of researchers jointly engaged in broad,
multi-purpose projects and may include
economists from the ECB, euro area NCBs,other central banks and policy-makingorganisations, as well as academics. The ECB
provides coordination and organisational
support for these networks, alone or with other
institutions.The Eurosystem Inflation PersistenceNetwork, which brings together researchers
from all Eurosystem central banks, was created
in 2003 for the purpose of analysing the
dynamics of inflation in the euro area and in the
national economies. A wide range of data isbeing used to study the phenomenon, includingindividual and sectoral data on consumer and
producer prices, macroeconomic inflation rates
and survey results, with the final results of the
analysis expected in 2005. In 2004 a large
proportion of the empirical analysis wasperformed, a sub-set of results was released inthe ECB™s Working Paper series and feedback
from the academic community was collected. A
selection of results was also presented at
several international workshops and conferences,
including a conference organised by thenetwork in December 2004 and hosted by the104ECBAnnualReport
2004ECB. The input received at these events will beused in the concluding phase of the network™s
analysis. The network has so far found that
prices of individual consumer goods and
services change relatively infrequently in theeuro area, namely once a year on average.When price adjustments occur, they tend to be
large and almost equally divided between price
increases and price decreases. Price rigidities
are more widespread in the services sector than
in the goods sector, and they tend to be higheron average in the euro area than in the UnitedStates. Furthermore, the network™s findings
suggest that inflation persistence may depend
on the inflation and monetary policy regimes in
place, and that, other things being equal, it
tends to be lower when expectations of pricestability are well rooted in the economy.The Euro Area Business-Cycle Network,organised in collaboration with the Centre for
Economic Policy Research (CEPR), provides a
forum for the study of the euro area business
cycle. It brings together researchers fromacademia, central banks and other policyinstitutions. In 2004 the network organised a
second training school on factor models and
methodologies for the analysis of the business
cycle, hosted by the Nationale Bank van
België/Banque Nationale de Belgique andBocconi University. Two workshops were alsoorganised, one on the business cycle in the new
Member States and acceding countries, hosted
by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, and the
second on recent advances in forecasting
combination, hosted by the Nationale Bank vanBelgië/Banque Nationale de Belgique. Sinceearly 2004 a substantial part of the network™s
output has been channelled through a new
discussion paper series jointly launched with
the CEPR.The Research Network on Capital Markets andFinancial Integration in Europe, launched in
2002 by the ECB and the Center for Financial
Studies (CFS), aims to stimulate policy-
relevant research on the integration of the
financial systems in Europe and theirinternational links. The network concludedits first two years of work with a symposiumin Frankfurt am Main in May 2004 (see
Box 12). The ECB and the CFS have decided
to continue the activities of the network until
2007, adding three priority areas: (i) therelationship between financial integration andfinancial stability, (ii) EU accession, financial
development and financial integration and
(iii) financial system modernisation and
economic growth in Europe. The ﬁLamfalussy
Fellowshipﬂ research programme, establishedwithin the framework of the network, was alsoextended to these areas.5.3MACROECONOMETRIC MODELLING OF THE
EURO AREA
A notable development in the field of
macroeconometric modelling in 2004 was the
work launched on a new generation of the
ECB™s Area-Wide Model. The model is being
revised in line with the latest developments
in macroeconomic theory and estimationmethods. In contrast to earlier models, thenew generation of macroeconometric models,
known as dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium models, are based to a much larger
extent on microeconomic foundations. With
the contribution of research undertaken at theECB, they are now sufficiently sophisticated tobe used in the policy realm.6 They are rapidlybecoming the standard for policy analysis and,
increasingly, forecasting in central banks
and policy organisations. To facilitate the
construction of the new Area-Wide Model, theECB has established a forum for cooperationwith the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and with the IMF, institutions
that are engaged in the construction and use of
similar models. The ECB and the Federal
Reserve System cooperate through theInternational Research Forum on Monetary6Eurosystem staff have made key contributions in this area. See

20046.1COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITIONS OF
MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED
ACCESSPursuant to Article 237(d) of the Treaty, theECB is entrusted with the task of monitoringthe fulfilment by the 25 EU NCBs and the ECB
of their obligations under Articles 101 and 102
of the Treaty and Council Regulations (EC)
Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 101
prohibits the ECB and the NCBs fromproviding overdraft facilities or any other typeof credit facility to governments and
Community institutions or bodies, as well as
from purchasing debt instruments directly from
them. Article 102 prohibits any measure, not
based on prudential considerations, whichestablishes privileged access by governmentsand Community institutions or bodies to
financial institutions. In parallel with the ECB,
the European Commission monitors Member
States™ compliance with the above provisions.The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™secondary market purchases of debtinstruments issued by both the domestic public
sector and the public sector of other Member
States. According to the recitals of Council
Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the acquisition of
public sector debt instruments in the secondarymarket must not be used to circumvent theobjective of Article 101 of the Treaty. Such
purchases should not become a form of indirect
monetary financing of the public sector.6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONS
Article 105(4) of the Treaty and Article 4 of the
Statute of the ESCB require that the ECB be
consulted by the relevant Community
institution and the responsible nationalauthorities,7 as appropriate, on any proposedCommunity or national legislation which fallswithin the ECB™s fields of competence. The
limits and conditions applicable to the
consultation of the ECB by national authorities
in respect of draft legislation are set out in6OTHER TASKS AND ACTIVITIES
Council Decision 98/415/EC of 29 June 1998.
All ECB opinions are published on the ECB™s
website. As of January 2005 opinions on draft
national legislation are, as a rule, published
immediately following their adoption andsubsequent transmission to the consultingauthority, as was already the case for opinions
on draft EU legislation.In total 41 consultations were initiated in2004, 32 by a national authority and nineby the EU Council. A list of the opinionsadopted in 2004 is annexed to this Annual
Report. The following opinions adopted at
the request of national authorities warrant
specific mention:The ECB was consulted by a number ofMember States, in particular Hungary and
Italy, on legislative proposals that, in the
ECB™s view, required modification in order to
ensure the compliance of NCBs™ statutes with
the provisions of central bank independence
laid down in the Treaty and the Statuteof the ESCB, including the personalindependence of the members of NCBs™
decision-making bodies.8The ECB was consulted by Italy, the
Netherlands and Slovakia on significantlegislative reforms of the financial supervisoryframework. The ECB examined draft
legislative proposals in Italy and the
Netherlands that were based on a ﬁtwin peaksﬂ
financial supervisory model whereby the
NCB would be responsible for prudentialsupervision of the entire financial sector and anational financial markets authority would be
responsible for the supervision of market
conduct.9 The ECB welcomed the proposedinstitutional framework in both countries,7In accordance with the Protocol on certain provisions relating to
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as
annexed to the Treaty, Article 105(4) of the Treaty and Article 4

of the Statute of the ESCB shall not apply to the United

Kingdom. Hence, the obligation to consult the ECB does not

extend to the national authorities of the United Kingdom.

noting in its opinion on the Dutch proposal thatthis approach recognised the distinct character
of the two goals of financial stability and
investor protection, taking into account
widening systemic risk due to the closerlinks between credit institutions, insurancecompanies, investment firms and pension
funds. The ECB considered that the legislative
proposal in Slovakia, which would extend the
NCB™s supervisory powers by making it
directly and fully responsible for thesupervision of Slovakia™s entire financialmarket, would establish a supervisory structure
that Œ although currently unique within the EU
Œ was fully compatible with the ESCB-related
tasks of an NCB.10The ECB was consulted by Belgium on a
proposed ﬁTobin taxﬂ which would take the
form of a tax on all foreign exchange
transactions in Belgium, provided that
comparable legislation were to be introduced
by other Member States or at the Community
level.11 Although the ECB acknowledged thegood intentions underlying the draft law, it
concluded that the economic and monetary
usefulness of such a tax was highly
questionable. Moreover, in the form proposed
by the draft Belgian legislation, the tax would
be incompatible with Article 56 of the Treatyon the free movement of capital and paymentsbetween Member States, and between Member
States and third countries.The ECB was consulted by France on draftlegislation authorising inflation-indexed loansfrom credit institutions.12 The ECB expressedits understanding of the objective to extend thefreedom of contract and allow economic agents
to hedge against inflation risk, but stressed that
widespread use of the indexation clause would
give rise to considerable concern, as awidespread indexation in wage and price-setting might generate excessive rigidity in the
relative price system and would risk fuelling
inflation spirals.
The ECB also delivered an opinion, pursuant toArticle 112(2)(b) of the Treaty and Article 11.2of the Statute of the ESCB, concerning arecommendation from the EU Council on the
appointment of a new member of the Executive
Board of the ECB.6.3ADMINISTRATION OF THE BORROWING
AND LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE

EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
In accordance with Article 123(2) of the Treatyand Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC)No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002, the ECB
continues to have responsibility for the
administration of the borrowing and lending
operations of the European Community under
the Medium-Term Financial Assistancemechanism. In 2004 the ECB did not performany administration tasks. There was no
outstanding balance at the end of 2003 and no
new operations were initiated during 2004.108ECBAnnualReport
2004Box 11EUROSYSTEM RESERVE MANAGEMENT SERVICES
In 2004 the Eurosystem completed the work started in 2003 on a new framework for theprovision of a comprehensive set of reserve management services in euro to central banks,
monetary authorities and government agencies located outside the euro area, and international
organisations. The new framework, developed in response to the continuously increasing use
of the euro as an international reserve currency, builds on the well-established reservemanagement services and experience of individual Eurosystem central banks. The servicesrange from the provision of custody accounts and related custodian (safekeeping) and
settlement services to cash and investment services. Examples of key services covered by the
new framework include (i) the provision of an automatic overnight investment facility which
enables customers to invest funds directly with the respective service provider and/or in the
market at attractive remuneration rates, (ii) the facilitation of automatic securities lendingprogrammes and (iii) the execution of orders and standing instructions in line with customers™specific investment preferences.One of the key aspects of the new framework is the provision of high-quality services forcustomers™ euro-denominated reserve assets through a single access point in the euro area. This
concept is comparable to the way in which reserve management services are offered by leadingcentral banks around the world. The individual Eurosystem central banks that act as singleaccess points are known as ﬁEurosystem service providersﬂ and offer the complete set of
reserve management services covered by the new framework. As a result of the implementation
of the single access point concept, customers can now settle and hold in safekeeping an
extensive range of fixed income euro-denominated securities, issued across the entire euro
area, using one single custody account. A high degree of harmonisation has been established,with each of the Eurosystem service providers offering the same set of reserve managementservices subject to harmonised terms and conditions and in line with general market standards.There are currently six Eurosystem service providers, namely the Deutsche Bundesbank, theBanco de España, the Banque de France, the Banca d™Italia, the Banque centrale du
Luxembourg and De Nederlandsche Bank. The remaining Eurosystem central banks may offersome of the services covered by the new framework. Furthermore, both Eurosystem serviceproviders and the other central banks of the Eurosystem may offer additional reserve
management services in euro on an individual basis. The ECB performs an overall coordination
role, ensuring the smooth functioning of the framework.In line with the way in which reserve management services have been provided for many years,the new framework is based on the core principles characterising the management of officialreserves, such as financial and legal security and, most importantly, confidentiality. The
reserve management services under the new framework are offered to traditional central bank
customers, thus meeting the special needs and concerns of those institutions that operate in the
same area of central banking activity as the Eurosystem itself.109ECBAnnualReport
2004The new framework, launched on 1 January 2005, will be a flexible and constantly evolvingone, closely following the latest developments in the financial industry and promptlyresponding to customers™ needs for a comprehensive and up-to-date set of euro-denominated
reserve management services.Artist

CHAPTER 3FINANCIAL STABILITY
AND INTEGRATION
112ECBAnnualReport
20041 FINANCIAL STABILITY
The Eurosystem contributes to the smoothconduct of policies pursued by the competent
national authorities relating to the prudential
supervision of credit institutions and the
stability of the financial system. It also offersadvice to these authorities and the EuropeanCommission on the scope and implementation
of Community legislation in these fields.1.1FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING
The ECB, in collaboration with the ESCB™s
Banking Supervision Committee (BSC),
monitors risks to financial stability in order to
assess the financial system™s shock-absorbing
capacity.1 The focus is on banks, as theycontinue to be the main intermediaries in the
channelling of funds from depositors to
borrowers in the euro area and as such are an
important channel through which risks may
spread to the rest of the financial system.
However, owing to the increasing importance
of other financial institutions and markets andtheir interlinkages with banks, vulnerabilitiesin these components of the financial system
may spread to banks. Thus the monitoring also
covers developments in these other
components.CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTS
In 2004 the capacity of the euro area financial
system to absorb shocks improved. Financial
institutions benefited from a better than
expected strengthening of global economic
activity, a bolstering of the balance sheets oflarge firms and a continued appetite for riskon the part of investors. As a result, the
profitability of banks and insurance companies
improved. However, earlier signs of fragility in
global financial markets remained, resulting
from the perceived risk of long-term interestrates rising from very low levels.In the euro area banking sector, large banksconsolidated the trend started in 2003,
continuing to show signs of improved
profitability. The main sources of improvementin 2004 were continued cost-cutting andreduced loan loss provisioning. Profitabilityincreases were broadly based, with the
weakest-performing banks also managing to
improve their return on equity.To support their profitability, cost control wasa priority for banks. Costs were primarily cut
by reducing the size of branch networks and
staff numbers. Provisioning for loan losses fell
in 2004, as in 2003. The main underlying factor
appeared to be a more favourable assessment ofcredit risk by banks owing to the economicrecovery. This reappraisal appeared to reflect
expectations of a consolidation of corporate
sector profitability and of further balance sheet
strengthening by large euro area firms.
However, there were indications that theoutlook for small and medium-sizedenterprises continued to be less favourable than
for large firms.Notwithstanding the improvement inprofitability, net interest income Œ the core
component of banking sector profitability Œcontinued to decline in 2004. This was despiteinitial signs of a pick-up in corporate lending
and the continued buoyancy of lending to
households for house purchase. The decline in
net interest income was mainly a product of the
low interest rate environment and a flatteningof the market yield curves which, whileboosting loan demand, weighed on euro area
banks™ lending and deposit margins. As for
banks™ non-interest income, the exceptional
trading profits recorded by many institutions in
2003 thanks to buoyant stock markets andnarrowing credit spreads were not repeated in2004. There were indications that some major
euro area banks increased their market risk in
the course of 2004. Banks enjoyed stronger fee
income, mostly due to increased activity
associated with financial markets, both on theirown account and from wealth management.1In 2004 the ECB published, for the first time, a report on the
stability of the euro area financial system entitled ﬁFinancial
Stability Reviewﬂ. It also published the third edition of ﬁEU

banking sector stabilityﬂ, which presents the main findings of

the regular monitoring by the BSC of banking sector stability.

These publications are available on the ECB™s website.
113ECBAnnualReport
2004The key regulatory solvency ratios of largeeuro area banks improved further in 2004. It is
notable that the banks with the weakest
solvency ratios managed to put their solvency
onto a more solid footing. The improved shock-absorbing capacity of these banks contributedpositively to financial system stability in the
euro area.The financial performance of insurancecompanies also improved further in 2004. Inthe non-life sector, the main factor was thestrength of net premium income, driven by
more risk-sensitive pricing and stricter
underwriting conditions. This improvement in
core business allowed the already comfortable
solvency position of non-life firms to be furtherstrengthened. Life insurers in most countrieswitnessed growth in premium income that was
underpinned by an increased demand for
products whose performance is linked to the
stock market. Together with growing net
investment income, this contributed to an
improvement in their solvency position.However, the financially weakest lifeinsurance companies still remain under
pressure.The global hedge fund industry continued togrow in 2004. Despite the low returns that wereachieved in 2004, there were no clear signs thatinvestors withdrew their money. The financial
stability implications of the growth in this
industry stem mainly from its links with the
banking sector. Strong competition among
prime brokers improved the access of hedgefunds to credit. Prime brokers are typicallybanks and securities firms that provide
financing, brokerage and other services to
hedge funds, with some large players coming
from the euro area. The prime brokers™
counterparty risk management, whichimproved after the near-failure of Long-TermCapital Management in 1998, benefited from
the extensive use of Value-at-Risk measures
and stress tests.STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTSStructural changes in the banking industry can
have important consequences for financial
stability in the longer term. Strategic choices
made by banks affect the risk/profitabilitytrade-off, ultimately having a bearing on theshock-absorbing capacity of the financial
system. In addition to the changes in
the regulatory and supervisory environment
(see Section 2 of this chapter), the
most important structural developments in2004 continued to concern consolidation,internationalisation, intermediation and
outsourcing.2The euro area banking sector has been
characterised by a continuous process ofconsolidation over recent years. In the period1997-2004 nearly 2,300 credit institutions
disappeared. This consolidation has been partlydue to mergers and acquisitions (M&As), but

also to the internal restructuring of banking
groups. Restructuring may help banks to
maintain or improve their profitability, whichshould ultimately lead to a more resilientbanking system. However, to the extent that
this leads to the creation of large and complex
financial institutions that are systemically
relevant, the ultimate impact may be more
ambiguous. This highlights the need forenhanced mechanisms for internal risk controlas well as for efficient supervision.M&A activity has been mostly confined todomestic deals. Over the past ten years, cross-
border European banking deals accounted foronly 15% of the total volume of mergers in thebanking sector, against an average of around
40% in the industrial sector. This continued
domestic orientation may be due to, inter alia,
the possibility of achieving greater cost
synergies through domestic consolidation, aswell as differences in tax rules, consumerprotection standards and corporate cultures.2A more detailed analysis of the structural developments can be
found in the BSC™s report entitled ﬁReview of structural
developments in the EU banking sectorﬂ, November 2004.
114ECBAnnualReport
2004Despite the relatively low cross-border M&Aactivity, the process of internationalisation is
continuing. The assets held by euro area banksin their branches and subsidiaries in othercountries of the area now represent more than
10% of the area™s unconsolidated banking
assets. Furthermore, banks have increasingly
been providing financial services on a cross-
border basis without having a localestablishment in the country where therecipient is located. Progress has been most
visible in the interbank and wholesale areas,
whereas the volume of retail activity performed
on a cross-border basis remains very low.The importance of retail operations has grownover the past few years, in particular owing tothe rapidly rising demand for loans for house
purchase. This underscores the importance for
euro area banks of focusing on core activities
and improving their knowledge of their
customer base.In 2004 the outsourcing of activities continuedto gain in importance. Two types of
outsourcing are taking place: outsourcing to
external suppliers and intra-group outsourcing.
Typically, support and back-office activitiesare outsourced externally, while core activitiesremain within the bank. In larger group
structures, some core activities are carried
out by specialised affiliates and their products
are distributed by other group entities.
Outsourcing is mainly driven by the desireto reduce costs, but the acquisition ofprofessional management and expertise and the
freeing-up of resources for core activities are
often additional motives. There is a need to
monitor the financial stability implications of
this development, particularly where multiplefinancial institutions are outsourcing to a
single service provider.1.2COOPERATION IN CRISIS SITUATIONS
The framework for cooperation among central
banks and banking supervisory authorities in
the area of crisis management continued to beenhanced. In June 2004 the central banks andbanking supervisors of the new Member States
agreed to adhere to the Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in crisis
management situations, which had been signed
by the other EU central banks and banking
supervisors in March 2003. This MoU consistsof a set of principles and procedures for cross-border cooperation between these institutions
in crisis situations.Moreover, the BSC and the Committee ofEuropean Banking Supervisors (CEBS) set up ajoint task force on crisis managementcomprising representatives from all EU
banking supervisors and central banks. Its task
is to develop proposals for further enhancing
cooperation, particularly in terms of
identifying best practices for handlingfinancial crises in a cross-border context. Itwill also contribute to the work of the
Economic and Financial Committee in the field
of crisis management.115ECBAnnualReport
20042FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
2.1BANKING
In the field of banking supervision, the reformof the capital adequacy framework remained a
major issue in 2004. In June the central bankgovernors and the heads of the bankingsupervisory authorities of the G10 countries
endorsed the new framework, known as the
New Basel Capital Framework, or Basel II.
This was a major achievement as it brings close
to completion the five-year-long effort by theBasel Committee on Banking Supervision(BCBS) and its member authorities in this area.
The new framework will be implemented as of
end-2006. However, the use of the most
advanced approaches to calculating banks™
capital requirements will only be allowed oneyear later.Following the endorsement of the newframework, the focus of international and
European activities in this area has shifted
towards implementation issues and the work
carried out by the BCBS™s AccordImplementation Group. A number of countries,both within the G10 and beyond, are expected
to carry out a fourth quantitative impact study
(known as the ﬁQIS4ﬂ). The results should be
available at the end of 2005 and may lead to
further quantitative adjustments of theframework in 2006. The BCBS has alsoidentified technical areas that require
additional work. The ECB will continue to
support this process of implementation and
contribute to it through its participation as
an observer in the BCBS and its mainsub-structures, including the AccordImplementation Group.At the European level, the new EU capitaladequacy framework, which will be based on
Basel II, will be introduced into EU legislationby amending the Codified Banking Directiveand the Capital Adequacy Directive. In
contrast to Basel II, which applies only to
internationally active banks, the EU capital
framework will apply to all credit institutions
on a consolidated and individual basis, as wellas to investment firms. The EU frameworkprovides for improved cooperation andcoordination among banking supervisory
authorities by enhancing the role of the
ﬁconsolidating supervisorﬂ. This is, as a rule,
the national supervisory authority of theMember State where the group™s parentinstitution received its banking licence and
which is responsible for the top level of
supervision of an EU cross-border banking
group. The role of this supervisor would be
enhanced by making it responsible for thecoordination of the processing and approval ofan EU cross-border group™s application to
use the more sophisticated approaches
to calculating capital requirements.
Strengthening the role of the consolidating
supervisor would therefore reduce the overallsupervisory burden on such a banking group.After being consulted by the EU Council, theECB delivered an opinion on the new EU
capital framework in which it generally
supported the thrust of the new set of rules. The
ECB placed emphasis on the parallelimplementation of the new EU framework andthe revised Basel framework, which is essential
to ensure a level playing-field between
European banks and their competitors from
other countries. The ECB also stressed the need
for enhanced cooperation among supervisoryauthorities to pursue consistent transpositionand implementation of EU legislation into
national laws and practices. In the latter field,
the CEBS is expected to play a major role.2.2SECURITIES
As one of the most significant measures of the
Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP), the EU
Council adopted in May 2004 the Financial
Instruments Markets Directive, replacing theregime set up by the Investment ServicesDirective of 1993. The new Directive lays
down a comprehensive set of rules concerning
all trading venues, namely regulated markets,
multilateral trading facilities and
intermediaries that execute client ordersinternally. This Directive reinforces the116ECBAnnualReport

of the empirical analysis, is available on the ECB™s website.
cooperation among financial regulators withthe purpose of achieving an effective
supervisory framework across the EU.Work is under way to further harmonisedisclosure rules applicable to companies withsecurities listed on European capital markets.
The EU Council reached a political agreement
on a new directive, known as the Transparency
Directive, in May 2004. The introduction of
harmonised and enhanced disclosure standardswill have beneficial effects on the Europeaneconomy.In view of their importance for the integrationof European financial markets and the
enhancement of financial stability, theEurosystem fully supports both regulatoryinitiatives and has followed the related
legislative process closely. The ECB also
contributed to the process via input provided to
the European Securities Committee.2.3ACCOUNTING
The Eurosystem has an interest in the
development of a harmonised accounting
framework in the EU because of its potential
impact on banks and ultimately on financialstability. The Eurosystem also supports thedevelopment of the new standards as they will
foster further financial integration and
contribute to the increased efficiency of
financial markets in Europe. During 2004 the
International Accounting Standards Board(IASB) continued its work on the newaccounting standards, and especially on
International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39)
dealing with the use of fair values for financial
instruments, which account for a large part of
banks™ balance sheets.The concerns regarding the potential financialstability implications voiced mainly by the
Governing Council and prudential supervisors
prompted the IASB to issue a revised exposure
draft on IAS 39, which introduced certainrestrictions on the optional use of fair valuesfor financial instruments. The assessment ofthe exposure draft by the Governing Council,
which was also based on quantitative elements,
was broadly supportive of this initiative, on the
assumption that banks implement the fair valueoption in a prudent manner. This assessmentwas conveyed in a letter sent by the President of
the ECB to the IASB in September 2004, which
also called for the fair value option to be
limited to reducing artificial volatility.3 Thedialogue with the IASB will continue in 2005.117ECBAnnualReport
20043FINANCIAL INTEGRATION
The ESCB is committed to the integration ofEuropean financial markets and market
infrastructures because of their key role in the
transmission of monetary policy and in
financial stability. Moreover, the integration offinancial markets should help to create a levelplaying-field for all economic agents
regardless of their location within the EU. In
addition, Article 105 of the Treaty states that
without prejudice to the objective of price
stability, the ESCB shall support the generaleconomic policies in the Community, amongwhich financial integration occupies a
prominent position. This support takes the form
of direct action and catalysis of collective
action by market participants.CONTRIBUTION TO THE EU FINANCIAL SERVICES

POLICYThe FSAP, launched by the European
Commission in May 1999, aimed to complete
the necessary legislative regime to enable the
effective exercise of market freedoms in
financial services throughout the EU. Theadoption of 39 of the 42 Community measureslisted in the FSAP by the end of the term of the
European Parliament in mid-2004 led to a
substantive improvement in EU financial
sector regulation and represents an important
step forward in the process of integration ofEuropean financial markets and marketinfrastructures. In June 2004 the ECB
contributed to the high-level conference on
European financial integration organised by
the European Commission, which was a first
stocktaking exercise on the FSAP™sachievements. The ECB™s view, widely sharedby other participants, was that the extent to
which the FSAP would contribute to the
effective establishment of a single financial
market would hinge on the consistent
implementation and enforcement of itsmeasures by the Member States. It is likely thatthe impact of the FSAP on financial institutions
and markets will take some time to fully
manifest itself, as a significant number of the
key measures have been adopted only recently
and most still require implementation at thenational level.Regarding future work, the ECB considers thata streamlined regulatory framework for
financial institutions should be developed as a
matter of priority. Such a framework should be
both more harmonised across Member Statesthan the current set-up and flexible enough toadapt to a changing environment. This project
should be complemented by a considerable
effort to converge supervisory practices, to be
achieved through enhanced cooperation
between national authorities, inter alia in theLevel 3 committees. This should also beaccompanied by a thorough analysis of the
relationship between financial integration and
financial stability. In particular, the impact of
the development of cross-border banking on
the home country control approach, which iscentral to the EU regulatory framework, shouldbe further analysed. Competition policy should
also be part of the post-FSAP environment, as it
is crucial for the development of a pan-
European market. A larger role for the private
sector, via self-regulation, could also be
effective in fostering integration. The ECB willcontribute to the definition of post-FSAPinitiatives. This contribution will benefit from
the ECB™s research activities on financial
integration issues (see Box 12).THE SHORT-TERM EUROPEAN PAPER INITIATIVE
The private sector can contribute to financial
integration via collective action aimed at
promoting the convergence of market
practices. The ECB can act as a catalyst in this
process, as exemplified by its role in the Short-
Term European Paper (STEP) initiative. TheACI, the Financial Markets Association,launched this initiative to foster the
convergence of standards and practices
prevailing in the fragmented European short-
term securities markets. This convergence will
be achieved through market players™ voluntarycompliance with standards set out in a marketconvention, which will cover information
disclosure, documentation, settlement and the
provision of data to the ESCB for the
production of statistics. The ACI will grant a
STEP label to existing issuance programmesthat meet these standards. However, the label118ECBAnnualReport
2004Box 12RESEARCH NETWORK ON CAPITAL MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN EUROPE
In 2002 the ECB and the Center for Financial Studies (CFS) launched a research network topromote research on capital markets and financial integration in Europe. The network was
initially set up for a period of two years, which ended in May 2004 with a symposium organised
around its five priority areas.Research presented in the priority area of European bond markets was particularly insightful.The introduction of a common pan-European electronic trading platform (Euro MTS) reduced
transaction costs substantially. Not only did it improve the integration of this market segment,
it also resulted in higher liquidity and lower yields, in particular for regularly issued Treasury
bills. However, some cross-country differences in yield spreads remain, notably for longer-
term bonds, and are largely explained by an international risk factor. Liquidity differentialsonly play a role in conjunction with this latter factor. The dynamically developing corporatebond market exhibits a relatively high level of integration, while factors related to the country
where a bond is issued account for only a marginal part of corporate bond yield spreads.The work done by the research network in its first two years helped to identify three key policyareas: (i) addressing the structural features of clearing and settlement systems that arehampering further integration, (ii) actively using competition policy to prevent practices thatdiscriminate against foreign financial service providers and (iii) removing the remaining
differences in national financial regulations that make the pan-European provision of financial
services more costly than necessary.Following the successful conclusion of the first phase, the ECB and the CFS decided that theactivities of the network would continue until 2007. The scope of the network has beenextended to the new EU Member States for this second phase. Possible areas for study in this
second phase are the initial effects of the FSAP on the functioning of the European financial
system, as well as a number of areas that were not addressed in the first phase. The main
priorities of the network have been broadened to include three areas not addressed in the first
phase: (i) the relationship between financial integration and financial stability, (ii) EUaccession, financial development and financial integration, and (iii) financial systemmodernisation and economic growth in Europe.11Comprehensive summaries of the results from the first phase of the network were published in the report entitled ﬁResearch
Network on capital markets and financial integration in Europe: Results and experiences after two yearsﬂ, ECB and CFS, 2004, an

will not refer to the financial soundness of theissuer, the liquidity of the assets or theaccuracy of information provided in the
information memorandum. Moreover, national
rules applicable to the debt instruments will
continue to apply. The initiative™s promoters
set out their recommendations in a reportpublished in March 2004, which also includedsome recommendations addressed to the
ESCB.The Governing Council assessed the ACI™srecommendations and took an overall
favourable attitude towards them. With respect
to the recommendations addressed to theESCB, it was decided that under certain119ECBAnnualReport
2004conditions the ESCB would technicallysupport the activities pertaining to the
introduction of a STEP label during the first
two years after its launch. However,
responsibility for the STEP label would restwith the STEP Market Committee. Such atechnical contribution to the labelling process
would not lead to the ESCB taking any action,
such as prohibition or suspension of issuance,
in the event of an issuer not complying with the
convention™s requirements. In such a case, theonly consequence would be that the ACI wouldwithdraw the STEP label from the issuance
programme. The Governing Council also
decided to act on the recommendation to
produce and publish statistics on yields and
volumes, subject to a check regarding theefficiency of the collection process. The ACI iscurrently carrying out the STEP project, taking
into account the Governing Council™s
decisions.SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA
The ECB also plays a catalyst role in theestablishment of a Single Euro Payments Area(SEPA), a project that was launched by the
European banking industry in 2002. The
objective is to enable cross-border payments to
be made from a single bank account throughout
the euro area as easily and safely as domesticpayments can be made. All payments shouldreach a level of safety and efficiency at least
as high as in the best-performing national
payment systems. The ECB participates as an
observer in the European Payments Council
(EPC), set up by the European banking industryto steer this project. Throughout 2004 theEurosystem continued to cooperate closely
with market participants through the Contact
Group on Euro Payments Strategy. It also
worked closely with the European Commission
in view of the complementary roles playedby the Commission and the Eurosystem infacilitating the SEPA.In a third progress report on the SEPA, theGoverning Council formally assessed the
banking sector™s achievements in this area.4 Itwelcomed the objective of the banking sector tohave a fully-fledged SEPA infrastructure by
end-2010 and recommended that a SEPA for
citizens should be achieved by as early as 2008
by offering citizens and commercial
enterprises the chance to use pan-Europeaninstruments and standards also for nationalpayments. The EPC is responsible for defining
the SEPA objectives and the overall strategy,
but the implementation may differ depending
on local conditions. In order to drive national
implementation, the Eurosystem has invitedeuro area banking communities to presentto the EPC during 2005 national plans for
the gradual transition to a SEPA before
end-2010.E-PAYMENTS
E-payments are payments that are generated
and handled electronically. Eurosystem
activities related to e-payments comprise
promoting cooperation and consensus-building
in the e-payments market, monitoring its
development, fostering its security and
improving related statistical information. In2004 the ECB continued to operate the websiteof the e-Payment Systems Observatory
(ePSO)5. It held a conference entitledﬁE-payments without frontiersﬂ in November
2004, prior to which an issues paper was
published for public comments. Although someprogress has been made overall, considerableeffort is still needed to achieve secure, user-
friendly and efficient cross-border e-payment
schemes. This is particularly the case for
electronic retail payment transactions, where
operational features, charges and regulationsstill differ substantially.CARD PAYMENT SCHEMES
The Eurosystem attaches great importance topayment cards as one of the most prominent
cashless payment instruments, in particular in across-border context. The ECB carried out asurvey to gain more information on the
structure of the card payment business in4ﬁTowards a Single Euro Payments Area Œ Third progress

2004Europe and on the different ways in which cardpayments are processed and settled. The survey
covered aspects related to governance, issuing
and acquiring, the general technical
infrastructure, as well as risk management andthe legal set-up. The ECB also organised aPayment Card Roundtable, which brought
together the major stakeholders and players in
this field. At this event, the Eurosystem
expressed its increasing interest in this field as
part of its actions to promote a SEPA, and anumber of issues were identified as requiringfollow-up, such as interchange fees, card
acceptance, the regulatory framework and
fraud prevention.SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT
INFRASTRUCTUREIn April 2004 the European Commissionreleased a communication on clearing and
settlement for public consultation, outlining
the actions that it intends to take to foster
European integration and efficiency in this
area. The Eurosystem responded positively tothis consultation.6The ECB fosters the integration and reform ofsecurities clearing and settlement through its
participation in the Clearing and Settlement
Advisory and Monitoring Experts Group,which the Commission set up in 2004. In thisway, it contributes to the coordination of
private and public sector initiatives and liaises
with the market, with a view to supporting the
removal of the technical barriers identified by
the Giovannini Group, a forum of financialexperts which advises the Commission onfinancial sector issues. Furthermore, the ECB
held a joint meeting with the European Central
Securities Depositories Association and the
Central and Eastern European Central
Securities Depositories Association, whichfocused on the integration of the EU clearingand settlement industry. The ECB would
welcome further steps towards the creation of
a single European association for central
securities depositories.The process of consolidation of the European
securities infrastructure continued in 2004
with the merger between the Finnish and
Swedish central securities depositories. The
long-term plan of the new group is to use acommon technological platform.MONITORING FINANCIAL INTEGRATION
The ECB has been developing variousindicators to measure the degree of financial
integration in the euro area. A set of suchindicators was included in an ECB OccasionalPaper published in 2004.7 The indicators serveas a basis for evaluating the progress of
integration in various financial markets.
Box 13 provides further information on the
integration of the euro area credit market. TheECB intends to continue measuring progress infinancial integration in the future.6ﬁCommunication on clearing and settlement Œ the Eurosystem™s

121ECBAnnualReport
2004Box 13FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN THE EURO AREA CREDIT MARKET
The comparison of interest rates across countries provides an important indication ofintegration in the retail banking market. As integration increases, interest rate differentials for
similar banking products can be expected to decrease across countries. However, differences in
products and institutions make it difficult to verify in practice whether differentials actually do
decrease. This is especially true in retail banking, as markets remain predominantly local in theeuro area. Apart from geographical barriers, there are many other reasons for cross-countrydifferentials, such as economic, structural and institutional factors. These factors relate, for
example, to differences in regulation, competition, bank-customer relationships and the
overall development of the financial system.The ECB™s harmonised interest rate statistics can be used to measure integration in the euroarea credit market. However, when interpreting the data, it should be borne in mind that, withineach interest rate category, there might still be considerable heterogeneity among national
series. This is due, for example, to the aggregation of various instruments within the currently
defined maturity bands and the aggregation of secured and unsecured loans within the same
category. Taking into account the data limitations, several measures of integration based on the
dispersion of interest rates across euro area countries indicate that the degree of integrationvaries significantly across different market segments. For instance, it seems to be higher forloans to households for house purchase and for short-term loans to non-financial corporations,
and lower for bank overdrafts to non-financial corporations and for loans to households for
consumption.122ECBAnnualReport
2004One of the statutory roles of the Eurosystem isto exercise oversight over payment and
clearing systems. The oversight aims to ensure
that the general organisation of payment flows
within the economy is efficient and safe. TheEurosystem also takes a general interest inother infrastructures which are used for the
transfer of securities, such as securities
clearing and settlement systems, because
failures during the settlement of collateral
could jeopardise the implementation ofmonetary policy and the smooth functioning ofpayment systems.4.1OVERSIGHT OF LARGE-VALUE EURO
PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND
INFRASTRUCTURESThe oversight role of the Eurosystem extends toall euro payment systems, including those
managed by the Eurosystem itself. The
Eurosystem applies the same oversight
standards to both its own systems and those thatare privately operated. These standards are theCore Principles for Systemically Important
Payment Systems adopted by the Governing
Council in 2001 as the basis for its oversight
policy on systemically important payment
systems.TARGET AND OTHER LARGE-VALUE EURO

PAYMENT SYSTEMS
The oversight framework for TARGET has
been further developed through the definition
of minimum methodological requirements withwhich all NCBs and the ECB should complyin conducting TARGET oversight. TARGET
overseers have also started looking at
TARGET2 from an oversight perspective.In 2004 large-value euro payment systems wereassessed against the Core Principles on thebasis of the situation in mid-2003. The overall
results were published in May 2004. It was
found that all TARGET components achieve a
high degree of compliance with the Core
Principles. A small number of enhancements tobe made were identified in the areas of4OVERSIGHT OF MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES
economic efficiency and business continuityarrangements. These issues will be followed up
by TARGET overseers and operators. The
TARGET overseers acknowledged the
important role played by TARGET operators inensuring the safe operation of TARGETthrough risk management. The overseers™
assessment of the status report prepared by the
TARGET operators on the risk situation in
TARGET was generally positive. The review
of the privately owned large-value europayment systems did not reveal any majorshortcomings.EURO 1Oversight of EURO 1 focused on plans by EBA
Clearing (EBA), the operator of EURO 1, tofurther develop the Flexible SettlementMechanism, allowing banks to settle their
STEP 2 positions in EURO 1 without becoming
direct members/shareholders of EURO 1.
STEP 2 is EBA™s retail payment system.
Subject to the ECB™s approval as overseer,
EBA envisages extending this function, whichis specifically limited at present to ﬁpre-fundparticipantsﬂ in EURO 1, to allow all EURO 1
members to transfer central bank money to
EURO 1 via the TARGET system in order to
increase their processing capacity in EURO 1.CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM
The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS)
system settles foreign exchange transactions
on a payment versus payment basis, thus
eliminating foreign exchange settlement risk
to a very large extent. It currently settlestransactions in 15 internationally tradedcurrencies, including, since December 2004,
the Hong Kong dollar, the New Zealand dollar,
the Korean won and the South African rand.In December 2004 CLS processed an average of69,000 trades per day with an average dailyvalue of USD 960 billion.8 According to asurvey conducted by the BIS in April 2004,
CLS was covering about one-quarter of the8Each trade consists of two transactions, one in each currency
involved. Thus, in December 2004 CLS settled transactions with
an average daily value equivalent to USD 1,920 billion.
123ECBAnnualReport
2004entire foreign exchange market at the time ofthe survey. After the US dollar, the euro is the
most important currency for settlement. In
December 2004 euro settlements in CLS
averaged €309 billion per day and accountedfor 22% of total settlements in terms of value
(US dollar settlements represented 46%). The
share of the euro decreased slightly by
comparison with 2003 as a result of the higher
number of currencies settled in CLS as well as
valuation effects.The ECB performs a dual role with regard toCLS. It is involved in the oversight of the
system and it provides settlement services. The
ECB participates in the cooperative oversight
of CLS, which is performed by the G10 andnon-G10 central banks of the currencies settledin the system, with the Federal Reserve System
acting as lead overseer. In 2004 the ECB
devoted most of its oversight attention to
further strengthening the resilience of CLS and
to ensuring the development of an objective
framework for adding new currencies.The ECB considers CLS a very convincingsolution for the reduction of foreign exchange
settlement risk for euro transactions. However,
only a minority of the wholesale foreign
exchange transactions involving the euro aresettled in CLS. Therefore, banks have beeninvited to review their settlement practices for
foreign exchange transactions and to assess
whether their methods of reducing this risk are
appropriate.SWIFTThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a messaging
network provider which facilitates the secure
exchange of financial messages between
financial institutions. Although it is not a bankor a financial institution itself, it is overseen bycentral banks because of its importance to the
smooth functioning of the worldwide financial
system. The ECB contributes to the oversight
of SWIFT, which is carried out by means of
cooperation between the G10 central banks,with the Nationale Bank van België/BanqueNationale de Belgique as lead overseer. In 2004the oversight arrangements were strengthened
in order to ensure the adequate involvement of
all G10 overseers and to allow for more
streamlined reporting and communicationbetween SWIFT and its overseers. Oversightattention focused on SWIFT™s resilience to
crises, internal risk management processes and
the replacement of SWIFT™s old messaging
network with SWIFTNet, an internet-based
technology infrastructure.CORRESPONDENT BANKINGBanks often have arrangements to provide one
another with payment services and related
facilities, primarily for payments across
national borders. Such arrangements arereferred to as correspondent banking. In 2004the Eurosystem conducted its fourth survey on
correspondent banking, which confirmed that
euro correspondent banking is highly
concentrated among a few players in the EU. At
present this does not pose any immediate
systemic risk; however, the Eurosystem willcontinue to monitor developments in this fieldin view of its interest in the stability of the
financial system as a whole.4.2RETAIL PAYMENT SERVICES
OVERSIGHT OF RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS
On the basis of the ﬁOversight standards foreuro retail payment systemsﬂ adopted by the
Governing Council in 2003, a classification
exercise carried out in 2004 identified 15 euroretail payment systems which fall within thescope of the Eurosystem™s oversight. Six were
classified as being of systemic importance and
thus have to comply with all ten Core
Principles. Seven are considered to be of
prominent importance and are thus required tocomply with the Eurosystem Retail Standards(a sub-set of the Core Principles). Two did not
fall into either category and will be subject to
oversight standards as and when defined for
them by the relevant overseer. The systems of
systemic and prominent importance areassessed against the oversight standards by the124ECBAnnualReport
2004relevant NCBs, while the ECB is responsiblefor assessing EBA™s STEP 2 system. The
overall assessment exercise and cross-country
consistency is coordinated at the Eurosystem
level.E-MONEY SYSTEMS
Following the definition of the electronic
money system security objectives in 2003 and
based upon voluntary assessments by some
e-money schemes, the Eurosystem in 2004started to fine-tune the methodologicalrequirements and terms of reference for the
assessment of relevant schemes which is
planned in 2005.4.3SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT
SYSTEMS
The Eurosystem plays two roles in the smooth
functioning of securities clearing and settlement
systems and their oversight. First, the
Governing Council assesses the compliance ofEU securities settlement systems (SSSs) withnine specific user standards.9 Second, theEurosystem cooperates with other authorities
responsible for the regulation and oversight of
securities clearing and settlement systems at the
EU level. In this context, the ECB encourageddebate about the development of a pan-Europeanregulatory framework for clearing and
settlement through its participation in the
Commission™s Clearing and Settlement
Advisory and Monitoring Experts Group. The
ESCB™s cooperation with the Committee ofEuropean Securities Regulators (CESR) hasbeen central to the development of pan-
European standards which will apply to clearing
and settlement. Furthermore, the ECB
contributed to the Group of Thirty, an
international think-tank, with a view to ensuringthat the Group™s recommendations concerningclearing and settlement, published in 2003, were
implemented in such a way as to be consistent
with EU initiatives. The ECB also shaped the
Commission™s initiative to update the
Settlement Finality Directive first adopted in1998. Finally, the ECB contributed to therecommendations for central counterpartiesdeveloped by the Committee on Payment and
Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the
International Organization of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO).ASSESSMENT OF SECURITIES SETTLEMENT
SYSTEMSAll Eurosystem credit operations have to be
covered by adequate collateral in the form of
eligible assets. These include securities whichare provided to the Eurosystem via SSSs,i.e. service providers that specialise in the transfer
of legal ownership of, or equivalent rights in,
eligible securities from one party to another. To
ensure that it is not exposed to undue risk in this
process, the Eurosystem annually assesses theSSSs that it uses against the nine userstandards.10 The 2004 assessment exercisecovered 18 SSSs. It concluded that the
compliance of these SSSs with the user
standards was high and that efforts were being
made to introduce further improvements. Some
systems have increased their operationalreliability, and measures to improve thefinancial soundness of system operators have
been taken. The Eurosystem monitors and
welcomes all efforts to improve the efficiency
and safety of the SSSs used in its credit
operations.COOPERATION WITH THE COMMITTEE OF

EUROPEAN SECURITIES REGULATORS
In 2001 the Governing Council approved a
framework for cooperation on securities
clearing and settlement systems between theESCB and CESR. A working group was set up,composed of a representative from each central
bank of the ESCB and from each securities
regulator in CESR. This working group drew
up a report on ﬁStandards for securities
clearing and settlement in the European9In the absence of harmonised EU oversight standards, the user
standards have been regarded as de facto common standards for
EU SSSs and, therefore, are dealt with in this chapter.

Nevertheless, the user standards are not intended to be a

comprehensive set of standards for the oversight or supervision

of SSSs.10ﬁStandards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in
ESCB credit operationsﬂ, January 1998.
125ECBAnnualReport
2004Unionﬂ11, which was approved by both theGoverning Council and CESR in October 2004.Using as a basis the recommendations for
SSSs made by the CPSS and IOSCO (known as
the ﬁCPSS-IOSCO Recommendationsﬂ), theESCB-CESR report contains 19 standards thataim to increase the safety, soundness and
efficiency of securities clearing and settlement
in the EU (see Box 14). In comparison with the
CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations, the ESCB-
CESR standards seek to deepen and strengthenrequirements in some areas on account of thespecific features of the European markets. The
overall objective of the ESCB-CESR standards
is to promote the integration of EU capital
markets, and they thus place greater emphasis
on common solutions and interoperability. TheCommission™s work in this area has been takeninto account.The working group has conducted its work in anopen and transparent manner. Interested parties
in the field of securities clearing and settlement
were invited to comment on the work on anumber of occasions. The contributionsreceived were considered carefully and the
working group has made every effort to ensure
that the views expressed have been addressed
in the standards. The standards will becomeapplicable once the methodology for assessingthe systems has been developed as a follow-upto the report. Since October 2004 the group
has continued its work in the following
four fields: (i) developing the assessment
methodology for the standards for SSSs,
(ii) developing standards and a methodology
for the assessment of central counterparties,(iii) analysing issues relating to significantcustodians and (iv) analysing the topics of
interest for cooperation among regulatory,
supervisory and oversight authorities.Box 14STANDARDS FOR SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
Standard 1: Legal framework
Securities clearing and settlement systems and links between them should have a well-founded, clear and transparent legal basis in the relevant jurisdictions.Standard 2: Trade confirmation and settlement matchingConfirmation of trades between direct market participants should occur as soon as possible
after trade execution, but no later than trade date (T+0). Where confirmation of trades by
indirect market participants (such as institutional investors) is required, it should occur as soonas possible after trade execution, preferably on T+0, but no later than T+1.Settlement instructions should be matched as soon as possible and, for settlement cycles that
extend beyond T+0, this should occur no later than the day before the specified settlement date.Standard 3: Settlement cycles and operating timesRolling settlement should be adopted in all securities markets. Final settlement should occur11Available on the ECB™s website.
126ECBAnnualReport
2004no later than T+3. The benefits and costs of EU-wide settlement cycles shorter than T+3 shouldbe evaluated.
CSDs and, where relevant, CCPs should harmonise their operating hours and days and be open
at least during the TARGET operating times for transactions denominated in euro.Standard 4: Central counterparties (CCPs)The benefits and costs of establishing a CCP should be evaluated. Where such a mechanism isintroduced, the CCP should rigorously control the risks it assumes.Standard 5: Securities lendingSecurities lending and borrowing (or repurchase agreements and other economically
equivalent transactions) should be encouraged as a method for avoiding settlement failures andexpediting the settlement of securities. Barriers that inhibit the practice of lending securitiesfor this purpose should be removed. The arrangements for securities lending should be sound,
safe and efficient.Standard 6: Central securities depositories (CSDs)Securities should be immobilised or dematerialised and transferred by book entry in CSDs tothe greatest possible extent. To safeguard the integrity of securities issues and the interests ofinvestors, the CSD should ensure that the issue, holding and transfer of securities are
conducted in an adequate and proper manner.Standard 7: Delivery versus payment (DVP)Principal risk should be eliminated by linking securities transfers to funds transfers in a waythat achieves delivery versus payment.Standard 8: Timing of settlement finalityIntraday settlement finality should be provided through real-time and/or multiple-batch
processing in order to reduce risks and allow effective settlement across systems.Standard 9: Credit and liquidity risk controlsFor systemic stability reasons, it is important that CSDs operate without interruption.
Therefore, when allowed by national legislation to grant credit, CSDs should limit their credit
activities exclusively to what is necessary for the smooth functioning of securities settlement
and asset servicing. CSDs that extend credit (including intraday and overnight credit) should
fully collateralise their credit exposures whenever practicable. Uncollateralised credit shouldbe restricted to a limited number of well-identified cases and subject to adequate risk controlmeasures including limits on risk exposure, the quality of the counterparty and the duration of
credit.
Most custodians are subject to EU banking regulations. For those that manage significant
arrangements for settling securities transactions, and in order to contain the systemic risks that
are linked to their securities settlement activity, national securities regulators, bankingsupervisors and overseers should examine the risk management policies applied by thosecustodians to assess whether they are in line with the risks created for the financial system. In
particular, the possibility of increasing the level of collateralisation of credit exposures,
including intraday credit, should be investigated.127ECBAnnualReport
2004Operators of net settlement systems should institute risk controls that, as a minimum, ensuretimely settlement in the event that the participant with the largest payment obligation is unable
to settle. The most reliable set of controls is a combination of collateral requirements and
lending limits.Standard 10: Cash settlement assetsAssets used to settle payment obligations arising from securities transactions should carrylittle or no credit or liquidity risk. If central bank money is not used, steps must be taken to
protect the participants in the system from potential losses and liquidity pressures arising from
the failure of the cash settlement agent whose assets are used for that purpose.Standard 11: Operational reliabilitySources of operational risk arising in the clearing and settlement process should be identified,monitored and regularly assessed. This risk should be minimised through the development of
appropriate systems and effective controls and procedures. Systems and related functions
should (i) be reliable and secure, (ii) be based on sound technical solutions, (iii) be developed
and maintained in accordance with proven procedures, (iv) have adequate, scalable capacity,
(v) have appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements, and (vi) besubject to frequent and independent audit of the procedures that allow for the timely recoveryof operations and the completion of the settlement process.Standard 12: Protection of customers™ securitiesEntities holding securities in custody should employ accounting practices and safekeeping
procedures that fully protect customers™ securities. It is essential that customers™ securities beprotected against the claims of the creditors of all entities involved in the custody chain.Standard 13: GovernanceGovernance arrangements for CSDs and CCPs should be designed to fulfil public interest
requirements and to promote the objectives of owners and market participants.Standard 14: AccessCSDs and CCPs should have objective and publicly disclosed criteria for participation that
permit fair and open access. Rules and requirements that restrict access should be aimed at
controlling risk.Standard 15: EfficiencyWhile maintaining safe and secure operations, securities clearing and settlement systemsshould be efficient.Standard 16: Communication procedures, messaging standards and straight-throughprocessing (STP)
Entities providing securities clearing and settlement services, and participants in their systemsshould use or accommodate the relevant international communication procedures andstandards for messaging and reference data in order to facilitate efficient clearing and
settlement across systems. This will promote straight-through processing (STP) across the
entire securities transaction flow.128ECBAnnualReport
2004Service providers should move towards STP in order to help achieve timely, safe and cost-effective securities processing, including confirmation, matching, netting, settlement and
custody.Standard 17: TransparencyCSDs and CCPs should provide market participants with sufficient information for them toidentify and accurately evaluate the risks and costs associated with securities clearing and
settlement services.
Significant custodians should provide sufficient information to enable their customers to
identify and accurately evaluate the risks associated with securities clearing and settlement
services.Standard 18: Regulation, supervision and oversightEntities providing securities clearing and settlement services should be subject to, as a
minimum, transparent, consistent and effective regulation and supervision. Securities clearing
and settlement systems/arrangements should be subject to, as a minimum, transparent,
consistent and effective central bank oversight. Central banks, securities regulators andbanking supervisors should cooperate with each other, both nationally and across borders (inparticular within the European Union), in an effective and transparent manner.Standard 19: Risks in cross-system links1CSDs that establish links to settle cross-system trades should design and operate such links sothat they effectively reduce the risks associated with cross-system settlements.1This standard does not cover links established by CCPs. This issue will be covered by the future work of the ESCB-CESR on CCPs

1.1POLICY ISSUES
THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT
In 2004 two euro area countries, namely Greeceand the Netherlands, and six of the ten new EUMember States, namely the Czech Republic,Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia,
were found to be in a situation of excessive
deficit (see also Section 2.5 of Chapter 1). The
excessive deficit procedures launched in 2003
for France and Germany continued to apply,although they were de facto held in abeyancefollowing the ECOFIN Council conclusions of
25 November 2003. These conclusions stated
that France and Germany should correct their
excessive deficits by 2005, instead of 2004 as
foreseen in the recommendations for thesecountries issued by the ECOFIN Council itselfunder Article 104(7) of the Treaty. The
excessive deficit procedure for Portugal was
abrogated.In July 2004 the European Court of Justiceannulled the ECOFIN Council™s conclusions of25 November 2003 with regard to France andGermany in so far as they contained a decision
to hold the excessive deficit procedures in
abeyance and to modify the earlier
recommendations for the two countries. The
Court stressed that the rules and proceduresforeseen in the Treaty and the Stability andGrowth Pact and the Commission™s right of
initiative must always be respected.The ECB expressed its satisfaction that thejudgement confirmed the need for the rules andprocedures foreseen in the Treaty and the Pactto be fully applied. It called upon the
institutions concerned to undertake the
necessary steps to ensure the full
implementation of the rules and procedures.In September 2004 the Commission issued acommunication on strengthening economic
governance and clarifying the implementation
of the Stability and Growth Pact. This
communication set out a number of proposals
to reform the Pact. Proposals regarding thepreventive arm of the Pact included ensuringearlier actions to correct inadequatedevelopments through a more timely and active
use of early warnings, redefining the medium-
term objectives for budget balances to allow for
country-specific circumstances and placinggreater emphasis on debt and sustainability inthe surveillance of budgetary positions.
Proposals regarding the corrective arm
included modifying the definition of the
exceptional circumstances under which a
deficit ratio above the reference value of 3% ofGDP is not excessive, changing the adjustmentpath for the correction of an excessive deficit
and clarifying the debt criterion.In the debate on the reform of the Stabilityand Growth Pact, the Governing Councilexpressed the view that improvements in theimplementation of the Pact were possible and
would be beneficial. In this regard, the European
Commission™s proposals for improving the
implementation of the preventive arm of the Pact
were useful. At the same time, the Governing
Council warned against changes to the Pact and,in particular, to the excessive deficit procedure.It considered the credibility of the 3% deficit
limit essential to anchoring expectations of
fiscal discipline.In September 2004 Greece reported deficit anddebt figures for the period from 2000 to 2003which were considerably higher than the
previously released figures. The deficit ratio
exceeded the 3% of GDP reference value.
Subsequently, revised figures for the period
from 1997 to 1999 were released, which alsoshowed deficits in excess of 3% of GDP (seealso Section 2.5 of Chapter 1). The ECB sees
the reliable compilation and the accurate
and timely reporting of government finance
statistics as being of vital importance to the
credibility of budgetary surveillance and ofEMU in general. The European accountingrules must be fully respected when recording
all types of expenditure and revenue, and
applied in a manner that is consistent and stable
over time and homogeneous across Member
States.133ECBAnnualReport
2004THE LISBON STRATEGY
At its meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, theEuropean Council set out a ten-year strategy Œ
the Lisbon strategy Œ which, by 2010, was to
render the EU ﬁthe most dynamic andcompetitive knowledge-based economy in theworld, capable of sustainable economic growth
with more and better jobs and greater social
cohesionﬂ. The results achieved under the
Lisbon strategy by 2004 were mixed. Advances
had been made in some areas, for exampleregarding labour markets. However, in mostrespects, progress was mediocre. It was clear
that the pace of reform would have to be
significantly stepped up if the Lisbon targets
were to be achieved by 2010.Against this background, the European Councildecided at its spring 2004 meeting to undertake
a mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. As a
first step, it invited the Commission to
establish a high-level group Œ chaired by Wim
Kok Œ to carry out an independent assessment
of the progress made under the Lisbon strategy,which would serve as the basis for the mid-termreview by the Commission and the EU Council.
The review is scheduled to be completed in
time for the spring European Council of March
2005.The high-level group presented its report,entitled ﬁFacing the challengeﬂ, in November
2004. The report stressed that, in the face of the
twin challenges of global competition and
ageing populations, maintaining the status quo
is not an option for the EU, especially if it is tosafeguard its social model. The reportconcluded that the ambitious objectives of the
Lisbon strategy, as well as the 2010 deadline
for achieving these objectives, should
therefore be upheld. It called for a better
prioritisation of objectives and urgent actionin five key policy areas: the knowledgesociety, the internal market, the business
climate, the labour market and environmental
sustainability.The ECB has repeatedly endorsed theambitions of the Lisbon strategy and hasexpressed its support for the efforts undertakenby governments and social partners. It has also
called for faster implementation of the required
measures and for more effective benchmarking
of reform progress. Reform is essential to
ensure future growth and employment
opportunities and to enhance the euro area™sability to adjust to economic shocks. Reformsin labour, capital, goods and services markets
in particular can promote investment, and
reduce inflation persistence through increased
competition. The EU should take advantage of
the mid-term review to revitalise the Lisbonstrategy and increase the pace of structuralreform.1.2INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION
At the final meeting of the IntergovernmentalConference (IGC) on 17-18 June 2004, the
Heads of State or Government reached
agreement on the Treaty establishing a
Constitution for Europe (the EuropeanConstitution). The European Constitution wassigned in Rome on 29 October 2004. Once
ratified by all 25 Member States in accordance
with their national procedures, it will enter into
force on 1 November 2006. In a number of
Member States, ratification procedures willinvolve holding a referendum.134ECBAnnualReport
2004The ECB monitored the IGC closely and madeboth formal and informal contributions to the
negotiations on issues of relevance to the tasks
and mandate of the ECB, the Eurosystem and
the ESCB. In accordance with Article 48 of theTreaty on European Union, the ECB wasconsulted and the Governing Council on
19 September 2003 adopted an opinion on the
draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for
Europe1. In addition, the President of the ECBsent letters to the President of the EU Councilin November 2003 and April 2004 to expand onthis opinion.The ECB welcomed the efforts made by theEuropean Convention on the Future of Europe
and the subsequent IGC to simplify, streamlineand clarify the legal and institutionalframework of the EU. It also made it clear that
the current provisions governing EMU were
sound in terms of both their objectives and the
allocation of responsibilities.In particular, the ECB considered it essentialthat price stability should remain not only theprimary objective of the ECB and the ESCB but
also a stated objective of the EU. The European
Constitution fully confirms this view.The ECB also deemed it indispensable to thesuccessful performance of its tasks that thespecial institutional features of the ECB and
the ESCB, which set the ECB apart from other
European institutions, be preserved. The
European Constitution preserves these special
institutional features by confirming theindependence of the ECB, the ESCB and theNCBs as well as the legal personality and
regulatory powers of the ECB. It further
underlines the special character of the ECB by
classifying it as one of the ﬁother Union
Institutions and advisory bodiesﬂ. The ECB isthus listed separately from the ﬁUnion™sInstitutionsﬂ, namely the European Parliament,
the European Council, the Council of
Ministers, the European Commission and the
Court of Justice of the European Union, which
are categorised as the EU™s ﬁinstitutionalframeworkﬂ.At the specific request of the ECB, the termﬁEurosystemﬂ has been introduced in the
European Constitution. This term, which refers
to the ECB and the NCBs of the euro area and
was adopted by the Governing Council in 1999,helps to distinguish between the ESCB, whichcomprises all EU central banks, and the central
banking system of the euro area. The term
ﬁEurosystemﬂ also appropriately reflects
the fact that the ECB and the euro area NCBs
are integral parts of one system (see alsoChapter 8).In view of the above, the ECB considers that theEuropean Constitution confirms the existing
EU monetary framework. It would welcome
the successful completion of the ratificationprocess.THE NEW WORKING METHODS OF THE
EUROGROUP
During the informal ECOFIN Council meeting
of 10-11 September 2004 in Scheveningen (the
Netherlands), the ministers of economy andfinance of the euro area agreed on new workingmethods for the Eurogroup. These new
methods are intended to improve the
Eurogroup™s efficiency and effectiveness.The new methods include more forward-looking strategic discussions, in particular onstructural reform, and the creation of a stable
Eurogroup presidency for a period of two years
instead of a rotating presidency of six months.
The Eurogroup President is elected by a simple
majority of the Eurogroup members. InScheveningen, the Prime Minister and FinanceMinister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker,
was elected as the first Eurogroup President for
a two-year period from 2005 to 2006.The ECB, which is regularly invited to take partin the meetings of the Eurogroup, participatedin the review of its working methods. The ECB
took the view that these new working methods,
including the creation of a stable Eurogroup
presidency, would help to make the functioning1CON/2003/20.
135ECBAnnualReport
2004of the Eurogroup more efficient and effective.The new methods do not imply any changes in
the allocation of tasks between the ECB and the
euro area finance ministers in the framework of
EMU. However, they underline the commonresponsibility of governments for the conductof sound fiscal and structural policies, which
are necessary for the continued success of the
single currency.136ECBAnnualReport
20042INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
2.1KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AND
FINANCIAL SYSTEM
SURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
Macroeconomic policies in the globaleconomy, in particular the policies conducted
by major industrial countries, are an essential
element of the international environment
which the ECB has to take into account in theconduct of its monetary policy and other tasks.The Eurosystem participates in the
surveillance of these macroeconomic policies
by international financial institutions and fora,
which takes place mainly at meetings of the
IMF Executive Board, the Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and Development(OECD), the G7 finance ministers and central
bank governors, and the G10 central bank
governors. The aim of the ECB is to exchange
views and review policy options conducive to a
stable macroeconomic environment, sound
macroeconomic policies and price stability inthe euro area.The global policy environment in 2004 wascharacterised by strong economic growth and
mostly contained inflationary pressures. There
was a welcome rebound in output in manyadvanced economies, as well as in LatinAmerica, coinciding with continued strong
growth rates in emerging markets in Asia and
eastern Europe. On the downside, however,
global imbalances Œ including external
imbalances of the US economy Œ persisted oreven widened further.On various occasions, the ECB stressed therisks and uncertainties related to the
continuation of such imbalances. Overall, the
ECB shares the view of the internationalcommunity that there are three keyrequirements for the adjustment process:
addressing the savings/investment shortfall
in the deficit countries; fostering higher
sustainable growth through structural reforms
in countries with relatively low potentialgrowth; and promoting exchange rateflexibility for major countries and regions thatlack such flexibility. With regard to exchange
rate developments, the G7 communiqués in

2004 and February 2005 emphasised that
exchange rates should reflect economicfundamentals and that excess volatility and
disorderly movements in exchange rates were
undesirable for economic growth.The increasing relevance of East Asiancountries for the global economy, as reflectedin their remarkable contribution to worldoutput growth and trade, was a major issue in
2004. The ECB closely monitored
developments in these countries and
strengthened its direct relations with Asian
central banks by organising, together with theMonetary Authority of Singapore, a high-levelseminar bringing together the 11 governors
from the Executives™ Meeting of East Asia-
Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2, thegovernors of the euro area NCBs and the
President of the ECB. The event, which took
place in Singapore in July 2004, focused on thegrowing economic weight of many East Asiancountries, the role of international currencies,
and regional integration and cooperation.Capital flows to emerging market economies,which the ECB continuously monitors onaccount of their relevance for internationalfinancial stability, remained robust in 2004, as
did the economic performance of these
countries in general. Crucial factors were
favourable external financing conditions, high
international prices of export commodities anda pick-up in import demand from advancedeconomies. As a result, current account
surpluses were recorded and external debt
levels generally decreased, although
indebtedness remained high in a number
of countries. Accommodative financingconditions induced public and privateemerging market borrowers to strongly tap
international bond markets, locking in low
interest rates. Having temporarily widened in2The EMEAP countries are Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR,

Korea, Singapore and Thailand.
137ECBAnnualReport
2004the second quarter of 2004, emerging marketbond spreads returned to low levels by
historical standards later in the year.Finally, the euro area itself was examined aspart of the international policy surveillanceexercises. Both the IMF and the OECD
conducted their regular reviews of the
monetary, financial and economic policies of
the euro area, in addition to their reviews of the
individual euro area countries. The Article IVconsultations of the IMF and the review by theOECD™s Economic and Development Review
Committee provided an opportunity for a
fruitful exchange of views between these
international organisations and the ECB, the
Eurogroup presidency and the EuropeanCommission. Following these discussions, theIMF and the OECD each produced a report
containing an assessment of euro area
policies.3 Special attention was paid to theaccession of ten new Member States to the EU
on 1 May 2004 in both reviews conducted in
2004.INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE
In view of the high degree of integration of the
EU in the global economy, the ESCB and the
Eurosystem have an interest in the smooth
functioning of the global financial system.Therefore, they actively contribute to ongoingdiscussions on the international financial
architecture, including through participation in
the relevant international institutions and fora.
In some of these institutions and fora the ECB
participates directly, and in others it has beengranted observer status. The ESCB also takespart in this work at the European level, in
particular in the Economic and Financial
Committee.In the context of work by the G10 financeministers and central bank governors, the ECBwelcomed the increasing inclusion of
collective action clauses (CACs) Œ contractual
provisions designed mainly to facilitate the
orderly restructuring of defaulted debts Œ in
sovereign bond issues. Within less than twoyears, the use of CACs has become the marketstandard for the issuance of sovereign bondsunder New York law, although without fully
meeting the G10 recommendations.The ECB also discussed other aspects ofprivate sector involvement in the resolution offinancial crises and reviewed the experience
with various instruments for promoting
such involvement. Furthermore, it monitored
progress in the development of the ﬁPrinciples
for Stable Capital Flows and Fair DebtRestructuring in Emerging Marketsﬂ, whichwere released in November 2004 by a group of
emerging market sovereign issuers and private
sector creditors. Previously known as the
ﬁCode of Conductﬂ, these principles aim
to promote disclosure of information onindebtedness, regular dialogue betweendebtors and creditors, debt restructuring
negotiations in good faith and fair treatment of
all affected creditors. The principles, which
were welcomed by the G20 finance ministers
and central bank governors, address some
remaining gaps in the architecture of globalfinance. Once implemented, they shouldsubstantially contribute to the longer-term
efforts to build a system which promotes global
cooperation, growth and financial stability.Another topic monitored by the ECB was theIMF™s financial position. At their meeting inOctober 2004, the G10 finance ministers and
central bank governors noted that the IMF™s
strong financial position, which was essential
for the fulfilment of its responsibilities, would
face challenges in the context of an evolvingworld economy. Coping with these challengeswould require a number of policy measures,
among which were strengthened surveillance,
more emphasis on debt sustainability in
lending decisions, strict adherence to the
recently agreed exceptional access frameworkas well as possible further changes in theIMF™s financial structure to promote timely
repayment and fewer successor arrangements.3IMF: ﬁEuro Area Policies: Staff Reportﬂ, August 2004; OECD:

138ECBAnnualReport
2004REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND COOPERATION
As the EU is the outcome of a lengthy processof regional economic integration itself, the
ECB has become a natural partner to monetary
authorities in several regional groupings in
the world, which call on the ECB to share
its experience with policy-makers and,
occasionally, academics. In this context,the ECB is interested not only in explainingthe European case, especially in the field
of monetary cooperation, but, equally
importantly, in understanding regional
economic integration outside the EU.In September 2004 a G20 workshop on regionaleconomic integration in a global framework
took place in Beijing, organised by the
People™s Bank of China and the ECB. Among
the issues examined were the preconditions
for regional cooperation arrangements, theoptimal sequencing of the processes ofintegration and monetary and financial
cooperation, and the compatibility between
regional trade integration and World Trade
Organization rules.In 2004 the ECB also strengthened itsrelations with regional monetary institutions
in Africa. In this respect, the ECB, together
with a number of euro area NCBs, has
extended technical assistance to the Western
African Monetary Institute (based in Accra,Ghana), the body undertaking the technicalpreparations for monetary integration amongEnglish-speaking countries in West Africa.INTERNATIONAL ROLE OF THE EURO
In 2004 the role of the euro remained largelystable in international capital and foreignexchange markets and as an anchor, reserve and
intervention currency. There was some
evidence of increased use of the euro as an
invoicing and settlement currency in the
international trade of selected euro areacountries. For most of these countries, the useof the euro appears to be more widespread in
the case of exports than in the case of imports
and, within exports, it is higher for goods than
for services. For most of the new EU Member
States and for the candidate countries, anotable increase in the share of the euro ininternational trade was also observed (on the
basis of data for 2003). The increase in the use
of the euro in many cases exceeded the increase
in trade relations with the euro area, suggesting
that the euro is being increasingly used in
the international trade of those countries withnon-euro area trading partners.4The ECB continued to develop the statisticalcoverage required for its analysis of the euro™s
international role. On the basis of previous
research, two new datasets were constructed toidentify salient features of the market for euro-denominated bonds issued by non-euro area
residents.2.2COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE
THE EUThe Eurosystem continued to build up its
contacts within the central banking community
outside the EU, mainly through the organisation
of seminars and workshops but also throughtechnical assistance. The objective is to gatherinformation and exchange views on economic
and monetary developments in different
regions of the world with a potential bearing on4See ﬁReview of the international role of the euroﬂ, ECB,

the global economic environment ordevelopments in the euro area.The Eurosystem™s technical assistance projectwith the Central Bank of the RussianFederation (CBR), funded by the EU within theframework of its Technical Assistance for the
Commonwealth of Independent States
(TACIS) programme, is being implemented as
planned. Launched in November 2003, the aim
of the two-year project is to further strengthenthe CBR™s banking supervision function as akey measure to foster a more stable financial
environment in Russia. The project™s training
plan, which was agreed in January 2004
between the CBR on the one hand, and nine
euro area NCBs, three supervisory authoritiesand the ECB on the other, foresees 64 courses,eight study visits and four high-level seminars.
By end-2004, 34 courses, four study visits and
two seminars had taken place. Roughly 400
CBR staff took part in this training plan. In
addition to the TACIS project, in May 2004 the
Eurosystem held its first bilateral high-levelseminar with the CBR in Helsinki, coordinatedby Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank and the
ECB. This seminar focused on monetary and
exchange rate policies, free capital mobility,
economic links between the EU and Russia,
including trade policies, as well as bankingsystem developments and financial sectorstability issues.The Eurosystem has established a frameworkfor cooperation with central banks in the
Mediterranean region. In January 2004 its firsthigh-level seminar with central bank governorsof the Barcelona partner countries5 took placein Naples, jointly organised by the ECB and
the Banca d™Italia. Following a technical
workshop in September 2004, the second high-
level seminar took place in Cannes in February2005, jointly organised by the ECB and theBanque de France. This seminar focused on
recent financial and monetary developments in
the Mediterranean region, economic linkages
between the euro area and the Mediterranean
countries (with a particular focus on workers™remittances), as well as central bank
independence.In the western Balkans, the ECB has initiatedrelations with central banks at seniormanagement level through a number of visits,including to the Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the National Bank of Serbia.
These visits served the purpose of developing a
dialogue between the ECB and the central
banks of these countries, given that they arepotential EU candidate countries.The Eurosystem also aimed to improve itsunderstanding of developments in systemically
important economies in Latin America. To this
end, the ECB, together with the Banco Centraldo Brasil, the Banco de Portugal and the Bancode España, organised the second high-level
seminar of the Eurosystem and Latin American
central banks, which took place in Rio de
Janeiro in November 2004 and was preceded
by a preparatory technical workshop held in
Lisbon. Participants discussed the possibleconstraints on the conduct of monetarypolicy arising from fiscal policies, debtvulnerabilities and financial system
characteristics.In the Middle East, the ECB further developedits relations with the Secretariat General of theGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and GCC
member states™ monetary agencies and central
banks in view of the plan to introduce a single
currency in the GCC member states6 by 2010.Artist

AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
Accountability can be understood as the legaland institutional obligation of an independent
central bank to explain its decisions clearly and
thoroughly to citizens and their elected
representatives, thereby enabling them to holdthe central bank responsible for achieving itsobjectives. Accountability thus constitutes an
important counterpart to the independence of a
central bank.From its inception, the ECB has acknowledgedthe fundamental importance of itsaccountability obligations and has maintained
a regular dialogue with citizens and their
elected representatives. The Treaty lays
down a number of reporting requirements for
the ECB, ranging from the publication of anannual report, a quarterly report and aweekly consolidated financial statement to
appearances before the European Parliament.
The ECB fully complies with these
requirements and even exceeds them, for
instance by publishing a Monthly Bulletin
rather than a quarterly report, by holdingmonthly press conferences and, sinceDecember 2004, by making public on a
monthly basis Governing Council decisions
taken in addition to interest rate decisions (see
also Section 1 of Chapter 6). At the
institutional level, the Treaty assigns aprominent role to the European Parliament withregard to the accountability of the ECB.The members of the Governing Councilcontinued during 2004 to deliver numerous
speeches throughout the euro area in order toexplain the ECB™s policies to the public. In linewith the provisions of Article 113 of the Treaty,
the ECB also continued to report regularly to
the European Parliament on the decisions taken
in the field of monetary policy and on its other
tasks. As in past years, the quarterlytestimonies by the President of the ECB beforethe Committee on Economic and Monetary
Affairs served as the main forum for these
regular exchanges of views. The President also
presented the ECB™s Annual Report 2003 to the
Committee and to the plenary of the EuropeanParliament.The Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs also invited another member of the
Executive Board to present the ECB™s views on
the economic environment and key issues in the
area of structural reform. In addition, the ECBparticipated in a hearing organised by theCommittee on the issue of the Single Euro
Payments Area.Beyond the scope of its Treaty obligations, theECB continued its voluntary practice ofreplying to written questions submitted bymembers of the European Parliament on issues
related to the ECB™s mandate. Furthermore, as
in previous years, a delegation of members of
the Committee on Economic and Monetary
Affairs visited the ECB for informaldiscussions on a variety of issues with themembers of the Executive Board.Article 112 of the Treaty provides that theEuropean Parliament will give its opinion on
nominees to the Executive Board prior to their
appointment by common accord by the Headsof State or Government of the Member Statesthat have adopted the euro. Following a
recommendation by the EU Council, the
European Parliament invited José Manuel
González-Páramo to appear before the
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairsto present his views and answer questions fromCommittee members. Following this hearing,
the plenary of the European Parliament
endorsed his appointment as successor to
Eugenio Domingo Solans in the Executive
Board.143ECBAnnualReport
2004During the President™s appearances before theEuropean Parliament, a wide variety of issues
were addressed. The main focus was on the
assessment of economic and monetary
developments and the conduct of the ECB™smonetary policy. Some of the issues raised bythe European Parliament during its exchanges
of views with the ECB and in its resolution on
the Annual Report 2003, adopted in October
2004, are discussed below.THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE SINGLE MONETARY

POLICY TO THE GENERAL ECONOMIC POLICIES

IN THE COMMUNITY
The contribution of the single monetary policy
to the general economic policies in the
Community was a key issue raised during theappearances of the President before theEuropean Parliament. While some members of
the Committee on Economic and Monetary
Affairs took the view that maintaining price
stability did not suffice to support growth and
employment and that a trade-off existed
between inflation and unemployment, otherCommittee members felt that the provisions setout in Article 105 of the Treaty were fully
appropriate and that the maintenance of price
stability should remain the primary objective
of the single monetary policy.The President pointed out that by crediblypursuing price stability and by solidly
anchoring medium and long-term inflation
expectations, the ECB makes its best possible
contribution to creating an economic
environment conducive to sustainable growth.In its resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report2003, the European Parliament endorsed this
view and commended the ECB for
concentrating on the maintenance of price
stability.FINANCIAL INTEGRATION AND REGULATION
Within the framework of the quarterly
testimonies, the members of the Committee on
Economic and Monetary Affairs also asked the
President for the ECB™s views on issues related
to financial integration and regulation. Inparticular, the European Parliament paid close2VIEWS OF THE ECB ON SELECTED TOPICS RAISED
AT MEETINGS WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
attention to the activities of the ESCB and theCommittee of European Securities Regulators
(CESR) in the field of securities clearing and
settlement. More specifically, the resolution on
the ECB™s Annual Report 2003 expressedconcern that the standards proposed by theESCB and CESR might pre-empt the upcoming
legislative process in this area.The President stressed that the proposedstandards were not intended to pre-empt futurelegislative acts. He stated that if a directive onclearing and settlement were to be adopted at a
later stage, the standards would need to be
assessed from the point of view of their
conformity with the provisions of such a
directive and, if warranted, adaptedaccordingly (see also Section 4 of Chapter 3).ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF
THE ECBIn its resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report
2003, the European Parliament considered the
dialogue with the ECB a success, as the regularexchanges of views made the ECB™s monetarypolicy more transparent and accessible to
the public. At the same time, the ECB and
the European Parliament continued to hold
diverging views on some issues related
to accountability and transparency. In itsresolution, the European Parliament reiteratedits call for the publication of minutes and the
balance of votes in Governing Council
meetings.As regards the request for the publication ofminutes, the President emphasised that thecommunication channels chosen by the ECB
were more effective in terms of timeliness. In
particular, the monthly press conferences held
immediately after Governing Council meetings
provide, in real time, a comprehensive accountof the reasons underpinning the GoverningCouncil™s decisions, and thus essentially serve
the same purpose as minutes. Furthermore, the
reasoning of the Governing Council is made
available to the public at a much earlier stage
than would be the case for formally adoptedminutes. These press conferences, together144ECBAnnualReport
2004with additional communication tools such asthe Monthly Bulletin and the monthly
communication on Governing Council
decisions taken in addition to interest rate
decisions, make the ECB one of the mosttransparent central banks in the world.With regard to the request for the disclosure ofinformation on the voting behaviour of
Governing Council members, the President
recalled that, in view of the specificinstitutional environment in which the singlemonetary policy operates, the publication of
votes carries the risk of putting undue national
pressure on members of the Governing Council
to deviate from the euro area perspective. The
ECB therefore continues its policy of notproviding any indications of individual viewsor voting behaviour. This approach helps to
focus public attention on the economic
rationale of policy decisions rather than on
individual voting behaviour and is consistent
with the collegial nature of the Governing
Council and its euro area perspective.COUNTERFEITING AND BANKNOTE SECURITY
The members of the Committee on Economic
and Monetary Affairs also addressed the issue
of euro counterfeiting. In its resolution on the
ECB™s Annual Report 2003, the EuropeanParliament called upon the ECB to be very alertwith regard to counterfeiting and to take
experience into account in the design of a new
generation of banknotes.During his appearances before the Committeeon Economic and Monetary Affairs, thePresident stressed that the ECB took the issue
of counterfeiting very seriously and
continuously sought to improve its policies
against counterfeiting. In this respect,
cooperation agreements in the fight againstcounterfeiting have been concluded withvarious national and international authorities.
Moreover, the experience with counterfeit
banknotes is guiding the research and
development of new security features for the
new generation of banknotes. Information onall counterfeit euro banknotes is stored in anECB database which is accessible to all EUcentral banks and national law enforcement
authorities (see also Section 3 of Chapter 2).Artist

CHAPTER 6EXTERNALCOMMUNICATION
148ECBAnnualReport
20041COMMUNICATION POLICY
Communication is an integral part of the ECB™smonetary policy and the performance of its
other tasks. Two key elements Œ openness
and transparency Œ guide the ECB™s
communication activities. Both contribute tothe effectiveness, efficiency and credibility ofthe ECB™s monetary policy. They also support
the ECB™s efforts to give full account of
its actions, as explained in more detail in
Chapter 5.In the field of communication, the ECB has sethigh standards. Monetary policy decisions are
explained at a press conference immediately
after the Governing Council has taken them. A
comprehensive introductory statement is made
and the President and Vice-President are at themedia™s disposal to answer questions. Theconcept of real-time, regular and detailed
explanations of the ECB™s monetary policy
assessment and decisions, which was
introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely open
and transparent approach to central bankcommunication.Moreover, communication on other decisionshas been further enhanced. Since December2004 a text presenting decisions taken by the
Governing Council in addition to interest rate
decisions has been published every month on
the websites of the Eurosystem central banks.As part of the institutional framework of theEU, the ECB has to make its legal acts and
statutory publications available in all official
Community languages, the number of which
increased from 11 to 20 with the enlargement
of the EU on 1 May 2004. The statutorypublications are the Annual Report, thequarterly version of the Monthly Bulletin, the
weekly consolidated financial statement of
the Eurosystem and the Convergence Report.
For the purposes of accountability and
transparency vis-à-vis the European citizensand their elected representatives, the ECBalso publishes other documentation in all
official languages, in particular press releases
on monetary policy decisions, Eurosystem
staff macroeconomic projections and policy
positions of relevance to the general public.The preparation, publication and distributionof the national language versions of the
ECB™s key publications are undertaken in
collaboration with the NCBs.149ECBAnnualReport
20042COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES
The ECB™s communication relies on severalpublications and tools, which are constantly
being refined in order to inform the general
public and interested parties more effectively.The Annual Report presents a comprehensivereview of the ECB™s activities in the previousyear and thus helps to hold the ECB
accountable for its actions. The Monthly
Bulletin provides a continual update of the
ECB™s assessment of economic and monetary
developments and detailed informationunderlying its decisions. It also containsarticles on general central banking topics.
The ECB contributes to the dissemination
of research findings by publishing working
papers and occasional papers and by
organising academic conferences, seminarsand workshops.Together with the BIS and the G10 centralbanks, the ECB launched a new publication
entitled the ﬁInternational Journal of Central
Bankingﬂ in 2004. It features policy-relevantarticles on the theory and practice of centralbanking, with special emphasis on research
related to monetary policy and financial
stability. The first quarterly issue will be
published in 2005.All members of the Governing Council directly
take part in the efforts to enhance public
knowledge and understanding of the ECB™s
tasks and policies through testimonies before
the European Parliament and national
parliaments, public speeches and the media. In2004 the six Executive Board members gavearound 220 speeches and numerous interviews,
as well as contributing articles to journals,
magazines and newspapers. Visits by the
President and other members of the Executive
Board to EU Member States and other countriesthroughout 2004 helped to bring the messagesof the ECB directly to the citizens of Europe
and beyond. The ECB™s communication efforts
were increasingly directed towards audiences
in the new EU Member States, both before and
after their accession to the EU in 2004.The euro area NCBs also play an important rolein ensuring the dissemination at the national
level of information on the euro and the
activities of the Eurosystem to the general
public and interested parties. They address avariety of regional and national audiences intheir own languages and environments.A further important channel for providinginformation to financial markets is the ECB™s
automated information system. This systemprovides real-time information to a number of150ECBAnnualReport
2004news agencies, which display on their screenspages showing the key ECB interest rates,
market operations and liquidity conditions in
the euro area. The pages are provided and
regularly updated by the ECB. Following anapplication procedure, the number of newsagencies granted access to this system by the
ECB rose from three to five in 2004.All documents published by the ECB and itsvarious activities are presented on the ECB™swebsite (www.ecb.int). In 2004 a new versionof the website was launched. Its design has
been modernised and contents restructured in
order to make it more user-friendly. The
website also serves as a contact point for
queries from the public and as a platform for thelaunch of ECB public consultations. Around47,000 queries were received through various
channels and handled in 2004.The ECB also practices openness in a literalsense, by welcoming visitor groups to its
premises in Frankfurt. In 2004 around 8,000visitors received first-hand information in theform of lectures and presentations given by
ECB staff. University students and
professionals from the financial sector made up
the majority of visitors.Artist

CHAPTER 7ENLARGEMENT OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION
154ECBAnnualReport
2004On 1 May 2004 ten countries of central andeastern Europe and the Mediterranean Œ the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia,
Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia
and Slovakia Œ joined the EU. The NCBs of thenew Member States were integrated into theESCB and their governors became full
members of the General Council. Experts from
these NCBs have full-member status in the
meetings of the ESCB committees whenever
they deal with matters that fall within the fieldof competence of the General Council.The integration of the new members into theESCB went smoothly. On the basis of the
ECB™s Accession Master Plan, set out in 2003,
preparations were undertaken in particular inthe fields of central bank operations, paymentand settlement systems, statistics, banknotes,
and IT infrastructure and applications. The
relevant ESCB IT infrastructure was enhanced
and now connects all 25 NCBs and the ECB,
providing increased reliability and enhanced
security services. The key for subscription tothe ECB™s capital was expanded and the NCBsof the new Member States paid up a percentage
of their subscribed capital as a contribution to
the operational costs of the ECB.The fifth high-level seminar on the accessionprocess, held in Paris in March 2004, markedthe final phase of the preparations for
accession. The seminar, jointly organised by
the ECB and the Banque de France, brought
together the governors and high-level
representatives of the central banks of theESCB, the ten acceding countries and the twocandidate countries Œ Bulgaria and Romania Œ
which were about to finalise negotiations for
accession to the EU. The seminar focused on
monetary and exchange rate policies and the
practical functioning of ERM II, budgetarydiscipline in the context of the Stability andGrowth Pact, and issues relating to financial
standards, accounting regulations and
corporate governance.The practical experience gained during theenlargement process has been assessed and will1SUCCESSFUL ACCESSION OF TEN NEW MEMBER
STATES
be taken into account in the preparations forfuture enlargements of the EU and the euro
area.On 20 October 2004 the European Commissionand the ECB published their respectiveConvergence Reports on the progress made in
the fulfilment of the obligations regarding the
achievement of EMU by the Member States
with a derogation status, including the new
Member States. The ECB™s ConvergenceReport concluded that none of the countriesassessed fulfilled all the conditions for
adopting the euro, including the legislative
requirements for safeguarding effective
independence of the NCBs.In terms of the number of countries joining, thisenlargement was the most important in the
history of European integration. However, the
economic weight of the new Member States is
relatively small compared with previous
enlargements. As a result, the accession of the
new Member States has not fundamentallychanged the key characteristics of the EUeconomy. Economic diversity within the EU
has increased, however, as the institutional and
structural features of the new Member States
are in many respects different from those of the
other Member States. The majority of the newMember States have been engaged in atransition process from a centrally planned to
a market economy, involving fundamental
institutional and structural changes in their
economies. Over a longer time horizon,
enlargement is likely to contribute positively toeconomic growth in the EU; indeed, a positiveimpact was already observed during the decade
of preparations for enlargement. This section
presents a number of key macroeconomic
features of the EU before and after the
accession of the new Member States togetherwith corresponding data for the United Statesand Japan.POPULATION AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
As indicated in Table 16, the 2004 enlargement
increased the population of the EU by almost20%, bringing the total population to 457.7155ECBAnnualReport
2004million. Measured in these terms, the EUcontinues to be the largest entity in the
industrialised world.Economic activity in the countries forming theEU25, as measured by GDP, was 9,752 billionin 2003, to which, on the basis of currentexchange rates, the accession of the new
Member States contributed 4.5%. From a
historical perspective, the economic size of
this enlargement was relatively limited. Forexample, the accession of Spain and Portugal tothe European Community in 1986 (which at the
time consisted of ten countries) raised the
Community™s total GDP by slightly more than
8%, and the enlargement to Austria, Finland
and Sweden in 1995 increased economic outputby just over 7%. On the basis of GDP data andReportingUnited

Table 16 Key characteristics of the EU economy including and excluding the newMember Statesexchange rates for 2003, the accession of thenew Member States led to a rise in the EU™s
share of global GDP from 30.4% to 31.8%.
It should be noted, however, that these
international comparisons are heavilyinfluenced by developments in exchange rates.One way to overcome the variability and
potential distortions associated with market
prices is to use a comparison on the basis of
purchasing power parities (PPPs), even if these
measures have their own caveats. In PPP termsand on the basis of 2003 data, the most recentenlargement increased the EU™s GDP by 9.5%,
making it larger than that of the United States.As the new Member States have a relativelylarge population in relation to their currentlevel of economic activity, their accession156ECBAnnualReport
2004implies a decline in the average level of GDPper capita in the EU. This, however, is expected
to change gradually in line with progress in
the catching-up process. Compared with the

United States and Japan, GDP per capita in theEU25 is relatively low, although the differencevis-à-vis Japan is much more limited in PPP
terms (on the basis of figures for 2003).The accession of the new Member States willalso have a longer-term effect on economicactivity as it affects incentives for andimpediments to the flow of goods, services,
capital and persons (the ﬁfour freedomsﬂ)
between the new Member States and the other
EU countries, although migration flows will be
restricted for a number of years. For example,the extension of the Single Market, byincreasing the scope for these four freedoms to
25 countries, is likely to enhance competition
and create economies of scale. The extent of
these effects and the speed at which they
materialise will, however, depend on many
factors, such as the future economic policies ofEU Member States.INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Following enlargement, EU15 trade with thenew Member States and trade among those
Member States is naturally recorded as intra-EU trade instead of international trade. Bycontrast, trade between the new Member Statesand the rest of the world excluding the EU15
countries now counts as extra-EU25 trade. Theaccession of the new Member States has
slightly reduced the trade openness of the EU,despite the fact that most new Member Statesare very open economies, as EU15 trade with
the new Member States is more significant than
the new Member States™ trade with countries
outside the EU. According to data for 2003,
exports of goods and services represented12.4% of GDP in the enlarged EU, comparedwith 9.3% and 12.2% for the United States and
Japan respectively.PRODUCTION STRUCTURE
The structure of production in the new MemberStates is characterised by a larger share ofagriculture (3.2%) and industry (31.9%) and asmaller share of services (64.9%) in GDP than
the average of the other EU countries. Sectoral
differences tend to be more pronounced in the
new Member States than in the EU15 in termsof the distribution of employment acrossthese sectors. Nevertheless, enlargement has
resulted in only slight changes in the shares of
these broad sectors in the EU™s GDP and the
distribution of employment. Relative to other
major economic blocs, the agricultural sectorin the EU is large by comparison with that ofthe United States and Japan, whereas the EU™s
industrial sector is larger than that of the
United States but smaller than that of Japan. Its
services sector is larger than that of Japan but
smaller than that of the United States.LABOUR MARKETThe average unemployment rate in the new
Member States is higher than that in the EU15
countries, and enlargement has thus led to a
somewhat higher average unemployment rate
for the EU25. Despite falling during the late1990s, the unemployment rate in both the EU15and the EU25, at 8.1% and 9.1% respectively in
2003, remains significantly higher than in
the United States and Japan, where it stood
at 6.0% and 5.3% respectively. In the new
central and eastern European Member States,unemployment rates have risen and regionalunemployment differences have grown during
the past decade, owing to structural
adjustments associated with the transition to a
market economy. Prospects for employment
could improve in the years ahead, however,as job-cutting associated with businessrestructuring may ease. In the longer run, the
new Member States™ potential for catching up
in terms of GDP per capita may also contribute
to favourable employment trends and lower
unemployment.The accession of the new Member Stateshas lowered the employment rate in the EU by
1.4 percentage points, so that it now stands
at 63.0%. A breakdown of the employment rate
in the new Member States suggests thatthe participation rate of men in particular is157ECBAnnualReport
2004considerably below the level in the EU15countries, whereas the gap for women is less
pronounced. The employment rate of older
workers (i.e. those aged between 55 and 64) is
also substantially lower in the new MemberStates than in the EU15. In comparison with theUnited States and Japan, the EU labour force
participation rate is low. The combination
of a lower participation rate and a higher
unemployment rate in the EU is reflected in an
employment rate which is below that of theUnited States and Japan.FISCAL POSITION AND THE SIZE OF THE
GOVERNMENT SECTOR
The accession of the new Member States has
not substantially changed the weighted averagegovernment deficit ratio in the EU, despite thefact that most new Member States have high
fiscal deficits (see also Section 2.5 of Chapter
1). The public expenditure and revenue shares
in GDP are somewhat smaller in most of the
new EU countries, although they are high in
relation to their income levels. The small sizeof the new Member States™ economies meansthat the share of the general government sector
in the EU25 is nevertheless broadly unchanged
compared with the EU15. As the public debt
ratio in the new Member States is generally
significantly below the level in the EU15, theaverage EU debt-to-GDP ratio is somewhatlower than before enlargement.The general government deficit, which stood at2.8% in the EU25 in 2003, is currently lower
than in the United States and Japan. At the sametime, the general government sector makes up alarger share of the economy in the EU25 than in
the United States and Japan. In the EU25, the
government expenditure ratio stands at almost
49% and the government revenue ratio at just
below 46%. In the United States, the generalgovernment sector accounts for somewhatmore than 34% of GDP in terms of expenditure
and slightly less than 30% of GDP in terms of
revenue. In Japan, the large public deficit is
accounted for by a government expenditure
ratio of just over 39% of GDP and a governmentrevenue ratio of almost 32%. The pastaccumulation of public deficits has led tosimilarly high public debt ratios in the EU and
the United States, but they are nonetheless
significantly lower than in Japan.FINANCIAL STRUCTUREEnlargement has not involved significant
changes to the financial structure of the EU as a
whole, although financial intermediation is on
average more focused on banks in the new
Member States than in the EU15. In most newMember States the financial sector is relativelysmall, as measured by total banking sector
assets and securities market capitalisation.
However, the level of financial intermediation,
i.e. the channelling of new funds by financial
institutions into new claims to financeinvestment, has recently advanced fairlyrapidly in some new Member States. In
comparison with the United States, the EU™s
financial sector continues to be more oriented
towards the banking sector, whereas the role of
stock markets in financial intermediation isless important. By comparison with Japan,however, the banking sector plays a smaller
role in the EU™s financial sector, while stock
markets are more significant.158ECBAnnualReport
2004There are currently four countries which havethe status of candidate for EU membership:
Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Turkey.
Following the successful completion of the
accession negotiations with Bulgaria andRomania, the European Council in December2004 called for the Accession Treaty with these
two countries to be finalised with a view to
signing it in April 2005. Bulgaria and Romania
would then be expected to join the EU in
January 2007. Croatia has been a candidatecountry since June 2004 and, provided thatthere is full cooperation with the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,
negotiations for EU accession will start in
March 2005. Turkey was granted the status of
candidate country by the Helsinki EuropeanCouncil in 1999. In December 2004 theEuropean Council decided that, in the light of a
Commission report and recommendation,
Turkey sufficiently fulfils the Copenhagen
political criteria to open accession negotiations
provided that it brings into force specific
pieces of legislation. Against this background,the European Council requested theCommission to prepare a proposal for a
framework for negotiations with a view to
opening negotiations on 3 October 2005.The Eurosystem continued to monitormonetary and economic developments in thecandidate countries and paid particular
attention to the disinflation process, financial
sector issues and structural convergence
towards the EU.The ECB further strengthened its bilateralrelations with the central banks of Bulgaria and
Romania. The first visits to the Bulgarian
National Bank and the National Bank of
Romania by the ECB at the Executive Board
level took place in October. The main purposeof these visits was to discuss future cooperationwith the Eurosystem, which will include a
pre-accession dialogue between the ECB and
the central banks of countries negotiating
accession. Following the signing of the
Accession Treaty, the governors of thesecentral banks will be invited to attend the2RELATIONS WITH EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES
meetings of the General Council in an observercapacity. Experts from these central banks will
be granted observer status in the ESCB
committees whenever the committees deal with
matters that fall within the field of competenceof the General Council. A visit to the CroatianNational Bank is expected to take place in
March 2005.The ECB also continued its high-level policydialogue with the Central Bank of the Republicof Turkey, including annual meetings at theExecutive Board level. The discussions
focused on Turkey™s macroeconomic
stabilisation process, the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey™s monetary and exchange
rate policy and the economic situation in theeuro area. In addition to the policy dialogue,technical cooperation between business areas
of the ECB and the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey continued.Artist

1.1THE EUROSYSTEM AND THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKS
The Eurosystem is the central banking systemof the euro area. It comprises the ECB and the
NCBs of the 12 Member States whose common
currency is the euro. The Governing Counciladopted the term ﬁEurosystemﬂ in order tofacilitate understanding of the structure of
central banking in the euro area. The term
underlines the shared identity, teamwork and
cooperation of all of its members and has also
been introduced into the Treaty establishing aConstitution for Europe, which was signed inRome on 29 October 2004. The Governing
Council has also approved a mission statement
for the Eurosystem together with strategic
intents and organisational principles for the
fulfilment of the Eurosystem functions by allmembers of the Eurosystem (see Box 15).The ESCB is composed of the ECB and theNCBs of all EU Member States (25 since 1 May
2004), i.e. it includes the NCBs of the Member
States which have not yet adopted the euro. Aslong as there are Member States which have notyet adopted the euro, it will be necessary to
make a distinction between the Eurosystem and
the ESCB.The ECB has legal personality under publicinternational law. It was established as the coreof the Eurosystem and the ESCB and ensures
that their respective tasks are carried out either
through its own activities or via the NCBs.Each NCB has legal personality according tothe national law of its respective country. The163ECBAnnualReport
2004euro area NCBs, which form an integral part ofthe Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred
upon the Eurosystem in accordance with the
rules established by the ECB™s decision-
making bodies. The NCBs also contribute tothe work of the Eurosystem and the ESCBthrough their participation in the various
Eurosystem/ESCB committees (see Section 1.5
of this chapter). They may perform non-
Eurosystem functions on their own
responsibility, unless the Governing Councilfinds that such functions interfere with theobjectives and tasks of the Eurosystem.The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed bythe decision-making bodies of the ECB: the
Governing Council and the Executive Board.Decision-making within the Eurosystem andthe ESCB is centralised. However, the ECB
and the euro area NCBs jointly contribute,
strategically and operationally, to attaining the
common goals, with due respect to theprinciple of decentralisation in accordance
with the Statute of the ESCB. The General
Council is constituted as a third decision-
making body of the ECB, for as long as there
are Member States which have not yet adoptedthe euro. The functioning of the decision-making bodies is governed by the Treaty, the
Statute of the ESCB and the relevant Rules of
Procedure1. In 2004, with a view to adaptingthese rules to developments since 1999 and to
anticipate the changes resulting from ESCBenlargement, both the Rules of Procedure of theECB and the Rules of Procedure of the General
Council of the ECB were reviewed.Box 15THE EUROSYSTEM MISSION STATEMENT
In January 2005 the Eurosystem mission statement was published. Its adoption by the
Governing Council, which followed the adoption by the Executive Board of the missionstatement of the ECB in August 2003, builds on the experience since 1999 with a commoncentral banking system for the euro area and the specific expertise and indispensable
contributions of all the central banks of the Eurosystem. The mission statement reads as
follows:ﬁThe Eurosystem, which comprises the European Central Bank and the national central banksof the Member States whose currency is the euro, is the monetary authority of the euro area. Wein the Eurosystem have as our primary objective the maintenance of price stability for the
common good. Acting also as a leading financial authority, we aim to safeguard financial
stability and promote European financial integration.In pursuing our objectives, we attach utmost importance to credibility, trust, transparency andaccountability. We aim for effective communication with the citizens of Europe and the media.We are committed to conducting our relations with European and national authorities in full
accordance with the Treaty provisions and with due regard to the principle of independence.We jointly contribute, strategically and operationally, to attaining our common goals, withdue respect to the principle of decentralisation. We are committed to good governance and to1For the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, see Decision ECB/2004/2 of

2004performing our tasks effectively and efficiently, in a spirit of cooperation and teamwork.Drawing on the breadth and depth of our experiences as well as on the exchange of know-how,
we aim to strengthen our shared identity, speak with a single voice and exploit synergies,
within a framework of clearly defined roles and responsibilities for all members of theEurosystem.ﬂThis mission statement sets out what the Eurosystem central banks aim to achieve together andthe way they interact and cooperate on the basis of shared values. It is based on an agreed set of
organisational principles and a number of strategic intents (more information can be found on
the ECB™s website). It also seeks to provide clear guidance to all members of staff and informthe public on how the Eurosystem performs the tasks and achieves the objectives that theTreaty and the Statute of the ESCB entrust to it.1.2THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
The Governing Council comprises all the
members of the Executive Board and the
governors of the NCBs of the Member States
which have adopted the euro. According to the
Treaty, its main responsibilities are:Œto adopt the guidelines and take the
decisions necessary to ensure theperformance of the tasks entrusted to the
Eurosystem;Œto formulate the monetary policy of the euro
area, including, as appropriate, decisions
relating to intermediate monetary
objectives, key interest rates and the supply
of reserves in the Eurosystem, and to
establish the necessary guidelines for their
implementation.The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice a
month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt am
Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an in-
depth assessment of monetary and economic
developments and takes related decisionsspecifically at its first meeting of the month,while the second meeting usually focuses on
issues related to other tasks and
responsibilities of the ECB and the
Eurosystem. In 2004 two meetings were held
outside Frankfurt: one was hosted by SuomenPankki Œ Finlands Bank in Helsinki and theother by the Nationale Bank van België/
Banque Nationale de Belgique in Brussels.When taking decisions on monetary policy andon other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem,
the members of the Governing Council do not
act as national representatives, but in a fully
independent personal capacity. This isreflected by the principle of ﬁone member, onevoteﬂ applied within the Governing Council.Pursuant to the ﬁenabling clauseﬂ contained inthe Treaty of Nice, the EU Council, meeting in
the composition of Heads of State orGovernment, on the basis of an ECBrecommendation, unanimously adopted a
Decision to amend Article 10.2 of the Statute of
the ESCB (voting modalities in the Governing
Council) on 21 March 2003. After being
ratified by all Member States, this Decisionentered into force on 1 June 2004. Inaccordance with this Decision, all members of
the Governing Council will continue to attend
meetings and participate in the deliberations.
However, the number of NCB governors
holding a voting right at any one time will notexceed 15. When the number of NCB governorsin the Governing Council exceeds 15, they will
exercise a voting right on the basis of a rotation
system. The 15 voting rights will rotate among
the governors according to pre-established
rules. The six members of the Executive Boardwill each maintain a permanent voting right.165ECBAnnualReport

The Eurosystem/ESCB committees havecontinued to play an important role in assisting
the ECB™s decision-making bodies in theperformance of their tasks. At the request ofboth the Governing Council and the Executive
Board, the committees have provided expertise
in their fields of competence and have
facilitated the decision-making process.
Membership of the committees is usuallyrestricted to staff of the Eurosystem centralbanks. However, the NCBs of the Member
States which have not yet adopted the euro take
part in the meetings of a committee whenever it
deals with matters that fall within the field of
competence of the General Council. Whereappropriate, other competent bodies, such asnational supervisory authorities in the case of
the Banking Supervision Committee, may also
be invited. At present there are 12 Eurosystem/
ESCB committees, all of which were
established under Article 9 of the Rules ofProcedure of the ECB.The Budget Committee, which was establishedunder Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure of
the ECB, assists the Governing Council inmatters related to the ECB™s budget.1.6CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In addition to the decision-making bodies, the
corporate governance of the ECB encompassesa number of external and internal control
layers, as well as rules concerning public
access to ECB documents.EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS
The Statute of the ESCB provides for two
layers, namely the external auditor2, which isappointed to audit the annual accounts of the2Following a tender 
procedure in 2002, KPMG DeutscheTreuhand-Gesellschaft AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft
was appointed as the ECB™s external auditor with a five-year

mandate covering financial years 2003 to 2007.

2004ECB (Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB),and the European Court of Auditors, which
examines the operational efficiency of the
management of the ECB (Article 27.2). The
annual report of the European Court ofAuditors, together with the ECB™s reply, ispublished in the Official Journal of the
European Union and on the ECB™s website.In August 2002 the Governing Council decidedthat, in order to give the fullest publicassurance as to the independence of the ECB™sexternal auditor, the principle of audit firm
rotation should be applied. This decision was
implemented as part of the procedure for the
appointment of the ECB™s external auditor.INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS
In 2004 the ECB™s internal auditors continued
to perform audit missions under the
responsibility of the Executive Board. Their
mandate is defined in the ECB Audit Charter.3The internal auditors assess and evaluate, on an
ad hoc basis, the adequacy and effectiveness ofthe ECB™s system of internal control and thequality of the ECB™s performance in carrying
out assigned responsibilities. They adhere to
the International Standards for the Professional
Practice of Internal Auditing established by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the InternalAuditors Committee, which is composed of the
heads of internal audit at the ECB and the
NCBs, is responsible for the coordination of
audit coverage for Eurosystem/ESCB jointprojects and operational systems.The internal control structure of the ECB isbased on a functional approach. Each
organisational unit (section, division,
directorate or directorate general) isresponsible for its own internal control andefficiency. In this respect, organisational units
implement operational control procedures
within their area of responsibility. For
example, a set of rules and procedures Œ known
as a Chinese wall Œ are in place to prevent
inside information, for instance originating inthe areas responsible for monetary policy, fromreaching the areas responsible for the
management of the ECB™s foreign reserves and
own funds portfolio. In addition to the controls

implemented by each organisational unit, theDirectorate Planning and Controlling, the RiskManagement Division and the Directorate
Internal Audit make proposals on control
issues affecting the ECB as a whole.The members of the Governing Council adhereto a Code of Conduct, which reflects theirresponsibility to safeguard the integrity and
reputation of the Eurosystem and to maintain
the effectiveness of its operations.4 TheGoverning Council has also appointed an
adviser to provide guidance to its members onsome aspects of professional conduct. Inaddition, the Code of Conduct of the ECB gives
guidance to, and sets benchmarks for, the staff
of the ECB and the members of the Executive
Board, all of whom are expected to maintain
high standards of professional ethics in the
performance of their duties.5In accordance with the rules against insider
trading, the ECB™s staff and the members of the

Executive Board are prohibited from taking
advantage of inside information when
conducting private financial activities at theirown risk and for their own account, or at therisk and for the account of a third party.6 AnEthics Adviser appointed by the Executive
Board ensures a consistent interpretation of
these rules.3This Charter is published on the ECB™s website to foster the
transparency of audit arrangements in place at the ECB.

interests. This ﬁOLAF Regulationﬂ provides
inter alia for the internal investigation of
suspected fraud by OLAF within the
Community institutions, bodies, offices andagencies.The OLAF Regulation foresees that each of thelatter adopt decisions in order for OLAF to be
able to carry out its investigations within each
of them. In June 2004 the Governing Counciladopted a decision8 concerning the terms andconditions for investigations by OLAF of theECB, which entered into force on 1 July 2004.
The ECB and OLAF have established contact
with a view to ensuring the proper functioning
of this framework for OLAF investigations.PUBLIC ACCESS TO ECB DOCUMENTS
In March 2004 the Governing Council adopted
Decision ECB/2004/3 on public access to ECB
documents9. This Decision aims to ensure thatthe ECB™s legal framework is in line with the
objectives and standards applied by otherCommunity institutions and bodies with regardto public access to their documents. It enhances
transparency, while at the same time taking
into account the independence of the ECB and
of the NCBs and ensuring the confidentiality of

STAFFING
The total number of budgeted staff positionsfor 2004 was 1,362.5 full-time equivalent(FTE) positions. At the end of 2004 the numberof staff employed by the ECB on permanent or
fixed-term contracts of at least 12 months was
1,314 (which corresponds to 1,309.0 FTE
positions). This compares with 1,213.5 FTE
positions at the end of 2003. The averagenumber of staff employed by the ECB in 2004was 1,261, compared with 1,160 in 2003. Of the
total of 1,309, 71 are staff members from the
ten new EU Member States currently employed
on contracts of more than a year. In 2004 137
new staff were recruited and 41 members ofstaff left the service of the ECB. The number ofFTE positions for 2005 has been set at 1,369.5,
representing a 0.5% increase over 2004.In addition 128 experts from NCBs came to theECB for short periods of approximately five
months on average. Of these experts, 63 camefrom the new EU Member States. These short-term assignments proved particularly useful for
both the ECB and the NCBs of the new Member
States in preparing for EU enlargement and in
supporting the integration of these NCBs into
the ESCB.In 2004 the ECB offered 123 short-termcontracts of less than a year to replace staff
on maternity, parental and unpaid leave,
compared with 113 in 2003.The ECB provided traineeships to 172 studentsand graduates, mainly with an economics
background, for an average duration of
approximately three months. 166 such
traineeships were offered in 2003. In 2004 54 of
the trainees were nationals of one of the newMember States, and a further six were fromRomania or Bulgaria. Of the 172 traineeships,
11 (12 in 2003) were offered in the framework
of the Graduate Research Programme, which is
aimed at highly talented research students at an
advanced stage of their doctoral studies.Under the Research Visitors Programme,
which focuses on specific high-level research
projects in the field of monetary policy, 18
research visitors were welcomed in 2004,
compared with 24 in 2003.INTERNAL MOBILITYIn 2004 95 staff members took up new positions
after successfully applying for internal
vacancies. In addition, the ECB encouraged
temporary internal mobility. 51 staff memberstook on another job for a limited period in orderto gain work experience or to address an urgent
but temporary business need, subsequently
returning to their previous position.EXTERNAL MOBILITYUnder the External Work Experience Scheme,
set up in 2003 to support staff development,
staff may be seconded to NCBs and other
relevant international and European
institutions. Seven staff members participated
in this scheme during 2004 for a period of four
to ten months. In addition, the ECB acceptsapplications for unpaid leave for up to threeyears for staff who want to take up employment
at other related financial organisations. In 2004
12 staff members took advantage of this option.
The Eurosystem™s organisational principles
approved by the Governing Council andpublished in January 2005 state that ﬁtheexchange of personnel, know-how and
experience shall be promoted by and among all
members of the Eurosystemﬂ.ECB IN MOTION
In October 2003 the Executive Board set up a
programme office to monitor and assess the
implementation of measures which it had
endorsed in the context of an organisational
change programme called ECB in Motion.
This initiative aimed to improve the efficiencyand effectiveness of the organisation andcovers management, professional development,
internal communication and bureaucracy
issues. In 2004 significant progress was made
in all four areas and the programme office
submitted its final report. Given that the impactof some measures will only be felt in the173ECBAnnualReport
2004medium term, progress will continue to bemonitored.REVIEW OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY
Since 1998 the ECB™s priorities have been theestablishment of its functions, the formulation
and implementation of the single monetarypolicy and the introduction of the euro. Thishas inevitably involved a focus of human
resources policy on technical expertise for
specific jobs. In the light of this, an in-depth
review of the human resources strategy was
undertaken and the conclusions were presentedin 2004.The main conclusion was that recruitmentpolicies should emphasise broader
competencies. Moreover, staff development
and mobility measures should be strengthened
in order to increase synergies and broadenexpertise within the ECB. Human resourcesmanagement has been made more flexible by
focusing external recruitment on career starters
with a more general background and
introducing fixed-term contracts for all new
staff and new managerial appointments. Thesemeasures will be complemented by theestablishment of an ECB Graduates™
Programme in 2005 aimed at recent graduates
with a broad educational background. A new,
junior management layer has been created in
order to establish a reasonable span of controlafter a period of rapid staff growth. Leadershipskills will be developed by increasing training
and coaching for managers. Based on the
ECB™s mission statement, six common values
have been identified and statements explaining
their meaning at the ECB have been developed.These values are: competence, effectivenessand efficiency, integrity, team spirit,
transparency and accountability, and working
for Europe. The values will play an integral
role in human resources policies, together with
an ECB-wide competency model andcompetency profiles that are being developed.DIVERSITY MANAGEMENTDiversity management seeks to harnessdifferences among staff in order to create
a productive and respectful working
environment in which talents are fully utilised
and organisational goals are met. Diversity
management is important for the ECB as itemploys staff from all EU Member States,works closely with the 25 NCBs of the EU and
serves the European public. The ECB is thus
integrating diversity management into its
day-to-day business so that the individual
competencies of staff are recognised and feedinto the high performance necessary for theECB to fulfil its tasks.2.2NEW ECB PREMISES
Decisive progress was made in 2004 in theplanning of the new ECB premises. In Februaryan international jury, chaired by the ECB™s
Vice-President, revealed the three winning
design proposals in the architectural design
competition. The first prize was awarded to
COOP HIMMELB(L)AU from Vienna, thesecond prize to ASP Schweger Assoziiertefrom Berlin and the third prize to 54f
architekten + ingenieure from Darmstadt in
cooperation with T. R. Hamzah & Yeang from
Selangor in Malaysia. Of the 12 candidates
shortlisted in 2003, these architects best metthe criteria set for the competition, namely:Œoverall town-planning, architecture and
landscape;Œcompliance with the main features of the
functional and spatial programme;Œfeasible energy/environmental concept and
compliance with the main features of theECB™s technical requirements; and174ECBAnnualReport
2004Œcompliance with the relevant regulations, in
particular in the field of building law andenvironmental law.The new ECB premises will be built on the siteof the Grossmarkthalle, a listed building whichformerly housed Frankfurt™s wholesale fruit
and vegetable market. One of the main
challenges for the architects was to incorporate
the large, red-brick building into a modern
office structure without changing itsfundamental appearance.The announcement of the prize-winners wasfollowed by an exhibition at the Deutsches
Architektur Museum in Frankfurt in which the
design proposals of all 71 architects whosubmitted designs for the competition wereshown to the public.In March 2004 the Governing Council decidedto invite the three prize-winning architects to
participate in a revision phase, the main
purpose of which was to review the designproposals and take account of therecommendations and requirements of the jury,
the ECB and the City of Frankfurt.Following the wholesalers™ move to their newheadquarters, the city authorities began to clearthe site in and around the Grossmarkthalle,which was purchased by the ECB from the City
of Frankfurt in 2002, in preparation for the
handover to the ECB. The handover took place
in December 2004. In line with the preservation
orders, great care was taken to ensure that thecentral building and the east and west wingswere left untouched. Those parts of the site that
would be appropriate for a memorial and
information space commemorating the
deportation of Jewish citizens from the
Grossmarkthalle were also retained. The ECB,the Frankfurt Jewish Community and the Cityof Frankfurt agreed to cooperate closely in
conducting a competition for the design of a
memorial. It is planned that the competition
will be launched by the end of 2005.The Governing Council reached a decision
on the design of the ECB™s future home on
13 January 2005. After extensive discussions
and careful evaluation, based on the selection
criteria, of the strengths and weaknesses of allthree prize-winning designs, the GoverningCouncil concluded that the revised design
concept of COOP HIMMELB(L)AU best met
the functional and technical requirements
specified by the ECB, and had features that
reflected the ECB™s values and translated theminto architectural language. This decisionconfirmed the judgement of the international
jury, who had awarded the first prize to this
project. The next step will be an ﬁoptimisationﬂ
phase in which the design will again be
reviewed, in particular to ensure the optimaluse of resources and to minimise costs. Moredetails on the competition and the winning
design can be found on the ECB™s website.175ECBAnnualReport
2004The ESCB Social Dialogue is a consultativeforum involving the ECB and employee
representatives from all the central banks of the
ESCB and European trade union federations.
Its purpose is to provide information and todiscuss decisions of the General Council andthe Governing Council in so far as they may
have a major impact on the employment
situation at the central banks of the ESCB.The ninth meeting of the ESCB SocialDialogue welcomed employee representativesfrom the NCBs of seven of the new EU Member
States. The participants confirmed their
commitment to the process of integration
within the ESCB in general, and their own
involvement in the ESCB Social Dialogue inparticular. The ECB encouraged the NCBs ofall the new Member States to facilitate the
participation of employee representatives in
the ESCB Social Dialogue.The main items on the agenda for both the ninthand tenth meetings of the ESCB SocialDialogue were TARGET2, the production ofbanknotes and the follow-up to the European
Commission™s Financial Services Action Plan.
There were also discussions on more general
topics, such as ways to develop a shared
identity and to foster cooperation on the basisof common principles. The ECB emphasisedthat the ESCB is committed to providing
central bank services of a high quality at the
lowest possible cost, which requires efficiency
and effectiveness. The participants were
informed that the Governing Council hadadopted a mission statement, strategicintents and organisational principles for the
Eurosystem. The employee representatives
underscored the importance of their
involvement in developing these issues and of
respecting differences in culture among thecentral banks. Finally, at the tenth meeting ofthe ESCB Social Dialogue, the ECB and the
staff representatives reaffirmed the value of
this unique consultative forum.3ESCB SOCIAL DIALOGUE

178ECBAnnual Report
20041PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The Bank™s activities in 2004 are described indetail in the relevant chapters of the Annual
Report.2FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS
Under Article 26.2 of the ESCB Statute, the
Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up bythe Executive Board, in accordance with theprinciples established by the Governing
Council. The Accounts are subsequently
approved by the Governing Council and
published thereafter.3FINANCIAL RESULTS
The ECB™s Annual Accounts for the year
ending 31 December 2004, as set out on pages
180 to 197, show a net loss of 1,636 million,following a net loss of 477 million in 2003. Aswas the case last year, the loss was mainly due
to the continued strengthening of the external
value of the euro, which resulted in write-
downs in the euro value of the ECB™s holdings
of US dollar-denominated assets. The net loss
is stated after taking into account all incomeearned by the ECB, including 733 million ofincome earned on its banknotes in circulation.The ECB™s interest income continued to be
affected in 2004 by historically low levels of
domestic and foreign interest rates.Since most of the ECB™s assets and liabilitiesare periodically revalued at current market
exchange rates and security prices, the ECB™s
profitability is very dependent on exchange
rate movements and, to a lesser extent, interest
rate exposures. These exposures stem mainlyfrom its large official holdings of theEurosystem™s foreign reserve assets, which are
invested in interest-bearing instruments.The harmonised accounting policies for theECB and the Eurosystem, which are describedin the notes to the Annual Accounts, have beenMANAGEMENT REPORT FOR THE YEAR
ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2004developed to take these substantial risks intoaccount and are based primarily on the
principle of prudence. In particular, they aim toensure that unrealised gains arising from the
revaluation of assets and liabilities are notrecognised as income and are therefore notdistributable as profit. Conversely, unrealised
losses resulting from revaluations are expensed
in the profit and loss account at the end of the
year.The bulk of the ECB™s foreign reserve assets isheld in US dollars, but they also include
holdings of Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. The
euro appreciated against the US dollar,
from USD 1.2630 on 31 December 2003 to
USD 1.3621 on 31 December 2004 (some 8%)and to a lesser extent against the Japanese yen.Consequently, the revaluation of the net
holdings of these currencies resulted in a
decline of 2.1 billion in their euro value.At the end of 2004, the ECB employed 1,309
staff (including 131 at managerial levels)compared with 1,213 one year earlier. Theincrease in 2004 was primarily due to the
consequences of EU enlargement. For further
details, please refer to Chapter 8 of the
Annual Report, Section 2 ﬁOrganisational
Developmentsﬂ and the Annual Accounts ŒﬁNotes on the Profit and Loss Accountﬂ.Total administrative expenses of the ECB,including depreciation, rose by 18% from
316 million in 2003 to 374 million in 2004.The main single factor in this increase was therise in the ECB™s pension fund obligations, ascalculated by the actuary, which contributed
substantially to an increase in staff costs
from 130 million to 161 million. In 2004,the emoluments of the Executive Board of
the ECB amounted in total to 2.1 million(2003: 2.0 million).Some 90 million were invested in fixed assets.The principal item (some 61 million) was thecapitalisation of the cost of the site of the
ECB™s new premises, following the finalpayment.179ECBAnnual Report
2004Funding of the ECB™s 2004 reported loss
On 11 March 2005, the Governing Councildecided to offset the loss for 2004 by (a) using
the entire remaining general reserve fund of
some 296 million, and (b) using the NCBs™monetary income of some 1,340 million, inaccordance with the provisions of Article 33.2
of the ESCB Statute. The amount of the NCBs™
monetary income used came to some 15% of
the total monetary income of the Eurosystem.
The way in which the loss was to be allocatedwas authorised, in principle, by the GoverningCouncil before the NCBs had closed their
Annual Accounts for 2004, with the result that
it affected their profits for that year too. Each
NCB contributed a share of its monetary
income in accordance with its weighting in thecapital key of the ECB.4CHANGES IN THE ECB™S CAPITAL STRUCTURE
IN 2004Under Article 29.3 of the ESCB Statute, the
capital key for the NCBs™ subscriptions to theECB™s capital must be adjusted every five
years. The first such adjustment following
the establishment of the ECB took place on
1 January 2004. On 1 May 2004, a second
change of the ECB™s capital key followed as aresult of the accession of ten new MemberStates. Taken together, these two steps had the
following effects:(a)a reduction in the overall weighting of the
euro area NCBs in the ECB™s capital key;(b)a concomitant reduction in the euro area
NCBs™ claims on the ECB that arose fromthe transfer of foreign reserve assets to the
ECB on entry into the euro area; and(c)an increase in the paid-up capital
contributions of the non-euro area NCBs
following the accession of ten new Member
States, which also reflects an increase from
5% to 7% in the minimal percentage of
subscribed capital paid by the 13 non-euroarea NCBs.Details of these changes are contained in note15 of the Annual Accounts.5INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND RISK
MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio is
composed of foreign reserve assets transferred
to it by the Eurosystem NCBs in accordance
with the provisions of Article 30 of the ESCBStatute and income thereon. Its purpose is tofund the ECB™s operations in the foreign
exchange market for the purposes set out in the
Treaty.The ECB™s own funds portfolio reflects theinvestment of its paid-up capital, the generalreserve fund and income accumulated on the
portfolio in the past. Its purpose is to provide
the ECB with a reserve to meet possible losses.The ECB™s investment activities and itsmanagement of the associated risks aredescribed in greater detail in Chapter 2 of theAnnual Report.6GOVERNANCE OF THE ECB

2004ACCOUNTING POLICIES1FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
The financial statements of the European
Central Bank (ECB) have been designed to
present fairly the financial position of the ECBand the results of its operations. They havebeen drawn up in accordance with the
following accounting policies2, which theGoverning Council of the ECB considers to be
appropriate to the nature of central bank
activity.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been
applied: economic reality and transparency,
prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet
events, materiality, the accruals principle,going concern, consistency and comparability.BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The accounts have been prepared on ahistorical cost basis, modified to include
market valuation of marketable securities, gold
and all other on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities denominated inforeign currency. Transactions in financial
assets and liabilities are reflected in the
accounts on the basis of the date on which they
are settled.GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency are converted into euro at the exchange
rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income
and expenses are converted at the exchange rateprevailing at the time of the transaction. Therevaluation of foreign exchange assets and
liabilities is performed on a currency-by-
currency basis, including on-balance-sheet and
off-balance-sheet instruments.Revaluation to the market price for assets andliabilities denominated in foreign currency is
treated separately from the exchange rate
revaluation.Gold is valued at the market price prevailing atthe year-end. No distinction is made between1The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in a
Decision of the Governing Council of the ECB of 5 December
2002 (ECB/2002/11), OJ L 58, 3.3.2003, pp. 38-59.2These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4
of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach

to the rules governing the accounting and financial reporting of

Eurosystem operations.the price and currency revaluation differencesfor gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is
accounted for on the basis of the price in euro
per fine ounce of gold, which is derived from
the exchange rate of the euro against the USdollar on 31 December 2004.SECURITIESAll marketable securities and similar assets arevalued at the mid-market prices prevailing at
the balance sheet date on a security-by-securitybasis. For the year ending 31 December 2004,mid-market prices on 30 December 2004 were
used. Non-marketable securities are valued at
cost.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the
period in which they are earned or incurred.
Realised gains and losses arising from the sale
of foreign exchange, gold and securities are
taken to the profit and loss account. Such
realised gains and losses are calculated by
reference to the average cost of the respectiveasset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income,but are transferred directly to a revaluation
account.Unrealised losses are taken to the profit andloss account if they exceed previous
revaluation gains registered in the
corresponding revaluation account. Unrealised
losses in any one security, currency or in gold
are not netted against unrealised gains in othersecurities, currencies or gold. In the event of anunrealised loss on any item at the year-end, the
average cost of that item is reduced to the year-
end exchange rate and/or market price.184ECBAnnualReport
2004Premiums or discounts arising on purchasedsecurities are calculated and presented as part
of interest income and are amortised over the
remaining life of the assets.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSUnder a repurchase agreement, securities are
sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to
repurchase them at an agreed price on a set
future date. These agreements to repurchase are
reflected on the liability side of the balancesheet and also lead to an interest expense in theprofit and loss account. Securities sold under
such an agreement remain on the balance sheet
of the ECB.Under a reverse repurchase agreement securitiesare bought for cash with a simultaneousagreement to sell them back to the counterparty
at an agreed price on a set future date. These
agreements to sell are recorded on the asset side
of the balance sheet, but are not included in the
ECB™s security holding and give rise to interest
income in the profit and loss account.Reverse transactions (including securitylending transactions) conducted under an
automated security lending programme are
recorded on the balance sheet only where
collateral is provided to the ECB in the form ofcash over the maturity of the transaction. In
2004 the ECB did not receive any collateral in
the form of cash over the maturity of such
transactions.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign
exchange forward transactions, forward legs of
foreign exchange swaps and other currency
instruments involving an exchange of one
currency for another at a future date, are
included in the net foreign currency positionfor the purpose of calculating foreign exchangegains and losses. Interest rate instruments are
revalued on an item-by-item basis. Outstanding
interest rate futures positions are recorded in
off-balance-sheet accounts. Daily changes in
the variation margin are recorded in the profitand loss account.POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTS
Assets and liabilities are adjusted for eventsthat occur between the annual balance sheet
date and the date on which the Governing
Council of the ECB approves the financialstatements, if such events materially affect thecondition of assets and liabilities at the balance
sheet date.INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM

BALANCESIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-border
transactions that occur between two EU central
banks. These transactions are processed
primarily via TARGET Œ the Trans-European
Automated Real-time Gross settlement
Express Transfer system (see Chapter 2) Œ andgive rise to bilateral balances in accounts heldbetween those EU central banks connected to
TARGET. These bilateral balances are then
assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving
each NCB with a single net bilateral position
vis-à-vis the ECB only. This position in the
books of the ECB represents the net claim orliability of each NCB against the rest of theESCB.Intra-ESCB balances of the euro area NCBswith the ECB (except for the capital of the ECB
and positions resulting from the transfer offoreign reserve assets to the ECB) aredescribed as intra-Eurosystem claims or
liabilities and are presented in the balance
sheet of the ECB as a single net asset or liability
position.Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from theallocation of euro banknotes within the
Eurosystem are included as a single net asset
under ﬁClaims related to the allocation of euro
banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see
ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes onaccounting policies).Intra-ESCB balances of the non-euro areaNCBs (Danmarks Nationalbank, Sveriges
Riksbank and the Bank of England) with the
ECB are disclosed under ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ.185ECBAnnualReport

Fixed assets, with the exception of land, arevalued at cost less depreciation. Land is valued
at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-
line basis, beginning in the quarter afteracquisition and continuing over the expectedeconomic lifetime of the asset, namely:The depreciation period for capitalisedbuilding and refurbishment expenditure
relating to the ECB™s existing premises has
been reduced in order to ensure that these assets
are completely written off before the ECB
moves to its final premises.THE ECB™S RETIREMENT PLANThe assets of the plan, which exist solely for the
purpose of providing benefits for members of
the plan and their dependants, are included in
the other assets of the ECB and are identifiedseparately in the notes on the balance sheet.Valuation gains and losses arising on the assets
of the pension fund are recognised as income
and expenditure of the retirement plan in the
year in which they arise. The benefits payable
from the core benefit account, resulting fromthe contributions of the ECB, have minimumguarantees underpinning the defined
contribution benefits.BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION
The ECB and the 12 euro area NCBs, whichtogether comprise the Eurosystem, issue eurobanknotes.3 The total value of euro banknotesin circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem
central banks on the last working day of each
month in accordance with the banknote
allocation key.4 The ECB has been allocated ashare of 8% of the total value of euro banknotesin circulation, which is disclosed under the
balance sheet liability item ﬁBanknotes in
circulationﬂ. The ECB™s share of the total euro
banknote issue is backed by claims on the
NCBs. These claims, which bear interest5, aredisclosed under the sub-item ﬁIntra-
Eurosystem claims: claims related to the
allocation of euro banknotes within the
Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/intra-
Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on
accounting policies). Interest income on theseclaims is included within the item ﬁNet interestincomeﬂ. The Governing Council has decided
that this income shall be distributed separately
to the NCBs in the form of an interim
distribution after the end of each quarter.6 Itwill be distributed in full unless the ECB™s netprofit for the year is less than its income earnedon euro banknotes in circulation, and subject to
any decision by the Governing Council to
reduce this income in respect of costs incurred
by the ECB in connection with the issue and
handling of euro banknotes.OTHER ISSUESTaking account of the ECB™s role as a central
bank, the Executive Board of the ECB
considers that the publication of a cash flow
statement would not provide the readers of the
financial statements with any additionalrelevant information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute ofthe ESCB, and on the basis of a

1GOLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLES
The ECB holds 24.7 million ounces of fine gold(2003: 24.7 million ounces). No transactions in
gold took place in 2004. The balance sheetmovement compared with 2003 is due to theyear-end revaluation of these holdings (see
ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and
liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).2CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO AREA
RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCYReceivables from the IMF
This asset represents the ECB™s holdings ofSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) as at31 December 2004. It arises as the result of a
two-way SDR buying and selling arrangement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange sales
or purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf of
the ECB, within minimum and maximumholding levels. The SDR is defined in terms of abasket of currencies. Its value is determined as
the weighted sum of exchange rates of the four
major currencies (euro, Japanese yen, pound
sterling and US dollar). For accounting
purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreigncurrency (see ﬁGold and foreign currencyassets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on
accounting policies).Balances with banks and security investments,

external loans and other external assetsClaims on euro area residents denominated in
foreign currency
These claims consist of balances with banks,
loans denominated in foreign currency and
investments in securities, denominated in US
dollar and Japanese yen, as follows:The reduction in these positions in 2004 is
primarily due to the year-end revaluation of the
ECB™s US dollar-denominated assets. Thedepreciation of the US dollar and, to a lesserextent, the Japanese yen vis-à-vis the euro
resulted in a significant decline in their euro
equivalent value (see ﬁGold and foreign
currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ and ﬁIncome
recognitionﬂ in the notes on accountingpolicies).3CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS

The main components of this item are asfollows:(a)Securities denominated in euro and reverse
repurchase agreements in euro constitutethe investment of the ECB™s own funds (see
also note 12).(b)The investment portfolios relating to the
ECB pension fund are valued at 120.2million (2003: 91.7 million). The assetsheld represent the investments of
accumulated pension contributions by theECB and the staff of the ECB as at31 December 2004, and are managed by
an external fund manager. The regular
contributions of the ECB and members of
the plan have been invested on a monthly
basis. The assets of the plan are not fungiblewith other financial assets of the ECB, andnet income thereon does not constitute
income of the ECB, but is reinvested in the
funds concerned, pending payment of

allocation of euro banknotes within theEurosystem for the final quarter (seeﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on
accounting policies).The remainder of this balance consistsprincipally of accrued interest on securities andother financial assets.SundryIn 2004 the main component of this item is aclaim against the German Federal Ministry of
Finance in respect of recoverable value addedand other indirect taxes paid. Such taxes arerefundable under the terms of Article 3 of the
Protocol concerning the Privileges and
Immunities of the European Communities,
which applies to the ECB by virtue of Article
40 of the Statute of the ESCB.7BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION
This item consists of the ECB™s share of the
total euro banknotes in circulation (see
ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes onaccounting policies).8LIABILITIES TO OTHER EURO AREA RESIDENTS
DENOMINATED IN EURO
This item comprises deposits by members ofthe Euro Banking Association (EBA) which are
used in order to provide the ECB with collateral
in respect of the EBA™s payments settled

11INTRA-EUROSYSTEM LIABILITIES
These represent the liabilities to euro areaNCBs that arose from the transfer of foreign
reserve assets to the ECB. The liabilities are
denominated in euro at a value fixed at the time
of their transfer. They are remunerated at
the latest available marginal rate for theEurosystem™s main refinancing operations,adjusted to reflect a zero return on the gold
component (see note 18 in the ﬁNotes on the
Profit and Loss Accountﬂ).Given the decrease in the weighting in the ECBcapital key of the euro area NCBs on 1 January2004 and the subsequent change to the ECB
capital key on 1 May 2004 (see note 15), the
initial total liability of 40,497,150,000 wasreduced in two stages to 39,782,265,622 byDecisions of the Governing Council pursuantto Article 30.3 of the ESCB Statute. Thisadjustment was made in order to provide thenecessary headroom to allow NCBs joining the
Eurosystem at a future date to make full
transfers of foreign reserve assets in proportion
to their prevailing shares in the ECB™s capitalkey. The reduction of the euro-denominatedliability did not require re-transfers of foreign
reserve assets between the ECB and the NCBs.Until 31From 1 January

(b) Capital of the ECBDue to the overall reduction of 1.3559% in theweighting of the euro area NCBs (with fullypaid-up subscriptions) in the ECB™s capital of5 billion, their share in the ECB™s subscribedcapital decreased from 4,049,715,000 to atotal of 3,981,920,000 on 1 January 2004.It was further reduced to 3,978,226,562 on1 May 2004 as a result of the accession of the
ten new Member States.In accordance with Article 49.3 of the Statuteof the ESCB, which was added to the Statute bythe Treaty of Accession, the ECB™s subscribedcapital will in future be automatically
increased when a new member joins the EU and
its NCB joins the ESCB. The increase is
determined by multiplying the prevailing
amount of the subscribed capital (i.e.5 billion) by the ratio, within the expandedcapital key, between the weighting of theentering NCB(s) and the weighting of those
NCBs that are already members of the ESCB.
Therefore, on 1 May 2004, the subscribed
capital of the ECB was increased to 5.565billion.The 13 non-euro area NCBs are required to payup a minimal percentage of their subscribed
capital as a contribution to the operational
costs of the ECB. On 1 May 2004 this
percentage was increased from 5% to 7%.Including the amounts received from the tennew non-euro area NCBs, this contribution
amounted to a total of 111,050,988 at thatdate. Unlike the euro area NCBs, the non-euro
area NCBs are not entitled to receive any share
of the distributable profits of the ECB,including income arising from the allocation ofeuro banknotes within the Eurosystem, nor are
they liable to fund any loss of the ECB.The combined effect of the above threedevelopments was that the paid-up capitaldecreased from 4,097,229,250 on31 December 2003 to 4,032,824,000 on1 January 2004 and then increased to4,089,277,550 on 1 May 2004, as shown in thetable below:193ECBAnnualReport

distributions already paid to the NCBsduring the year, amounting to 536 millionin total;(b)to withhold the final quarterly interim
distribution of 197 million.Remuneration of NCBs™ claims in respect of

20WRITE-DOWNS ON FINANCIAL ASSETS AND
POSITIONSThis expense is primarily due to the write-downof the average acquisition cost of the ECB™s
US dollar holding to its end-of-year exchangerate as at 31 December 2004, following thedepreciation of this currency against the euro
over the year.21NET EXPENSE FROM FEES AND COMMISSIONS
Income under this heading arose primarily frompenalties imposed on credit institutions fornon-compliance with the minimum reserve
requirements. Expenses primarily relate to fees
payable on current accounts and in connection
with the execution of foreign currency interest
rate futures (see note 17 in the ﬁNotes on theBalance Sheetﬂ).22OTHER
 INCOMEOther miscellaneous income during the year
arose principally from the transfer of unusedadministrative provisions to the profit andloss account. As from 2004, this item also
includes the contribution by the NCBs of the
ten new Member States to the local annual
service fees, resulting from their localconnection, on their accession, to the secureESCB IT infrastructure. In the first instance,
these costs are borne centrally by the ECB.NCBs™ contributions will cease on therespective Member States™ entry into the euroarea.23STAFF COSTS
Salaries, allowances and staff insurance costs
of 120.0 million (2003: 108.2 million) andemployer™s contributions to the ECB™s pensionfund are included under this heading. The
emoluments of the Executive Board of the ECB
amounted to a total of 2.1 million (2003: 2.0million). No pensions were paid to former
members of the Executive Board or theirdependants during the year. Transitionalpayments were made to departing members of
the Executive Board. Salaries and allowances,
including the emoluments of holders of senior
management positions, are modelled in essence
on, and are comparable with, the remunerationscheme of the European Communities.The increase in this item in 2004 is primarilydue to an increase in the ECB™s obligation in
respect of the pension fund, as calculated by the
actuary (see also note 24).At the end of 2004 the ECB employed 1,309staff, of whom 131 held managerial positions.
The change in the number of staff during 2004
was as follows:20042003
As at 1 January1,2131,105
New staff137149

Resignations4141

As at 31 December1,3091,213

197ECBAnnualReport
200424THE ECB™S RETIREMENT PLAN
In accordance with the rules of the ECB™sretirement plan, a triennial full actuarial
valuation is required. The latest full actuarialvaluation was carried out as at 31 December2003, assuming all members left service, and
pensionable service ceased, on that date.The pension cost relating to the plan is assessedin accordance with the advice of a qualifiedactuary. The total pension cost to the ECBincluding a provision for disability and post-
retirement benefits was 41.1 million (2003:21.7 million). This cost includes a provisionfor pensions to members of the Executive
Board of 1.8 million (2003: 1.9 million) andany supplementary contributions. The required
rate of future service contributions by the ECB
is 16.5% of pensionable earnings of all staff.25ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
These cover all other current expenses relating
to the renting and maintenance of premises,
goods and equipment of a non-capital nature,
professional fees and other services and
supplies, together with staff-related expenses
including recruitment, relocation, installation,training and resettlement.26BANKNOTE PRODUCTION SERVICES
In 2004, as in 2003, this expense related to
cross-border transportation costs of eurobanknotes between NCBs to meet unexpected
fluctuations in demand. These costs are borne
centrally by the ECB.198ECBAnnualReport
2004NOTE ON THE ALLOCATION OF LOSSES
1Under Article 32.5 of the Statute of the ESCB, the sum of the
national central banks™ monetary income is to be allocated to the
national central banks in proportion to their paid-up shares in the

capital of the ECB.This note is not part of the financial statementsof the ECB for the year 2004. It is published in
the Annual Report for information purposes
only.INCOME RELATED TO THE ECB™S BANKNOTE ISSUE
Following a decision by the Governing Council
of the ECB, the amount of €733 million wasretained by the ECB to ensure that the totalprofit distribution for the year did not exceedthe ECB™s net profit for the year. This amount
represents the full income relating to the ECB™s
share of total euro banknotes in circulation for
2004.COVERAGE OF ECB LOSSES
Under Article 33.2 of the Statute of the ESCB,
in the event of a loss incurred by the ECB, the
shortfall may be offset against the general
reserve fund of the ECB and, if necessary,following a decision by the Governing Council,against the monetary income of the relevant
financial year in proportion and up to the
amounts allocated to the national central banks
in accordance with Article 32.5 of the Statute.1On 11 March 2005, the Governing Council of
the ECB decided to cover the loss for the year
ending 31 December 2004 as follows:20042003
Loss for the year(1,636,028,702)(476,688,785)

Auditor™s reportPresident and Governing Councilof the European Central BankFrankfurt am MainWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of the European Central Bank as of31 December 2004 and the related profit and loss account for the year then ended as well as the notes.
These annual accounts are the responsibility of the European Central Bank™s Executive Board. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual accounts based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standardsrequire that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annualaccounts are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the annual accounts. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.In our opinion, the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position of the EuropeanCentral Bank as of 31 December 2004 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in
accordance with the accounting policies as described in the first part of the notes.Frankfurt am Main, 4 March 2005

The monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of monetaryindicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measuresof excess liquidity (see also economic analysis).Monetary income: income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the Eurosystem™smonetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with guidelinesestablished by the Governing Council and held against banknotes in circulation and depositliabilities to credit institutions.Money market: the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded usinginstruments which generally have an original maturity of up to and including one year.Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in thefinancial market. With regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, Eurosystem open marketoperations can be divided into four categories: main refinancing operations; longer-termrefinancing operations; fine-tuning operations; and structural operations. As for theinstruments used, reverse transactions are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystemand can be employed in all four categories of operations. In addition, the issuance of debt
certificates and outright transactions are available for structural operations, while outrighttransactions, foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits are available forthe conduct of fine-tuning operations.Option: a financial instrument that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sellspecific assets (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predetermined price (the strike or exercise price) at orup to a certain future date (the exercise or maturity date).225ECBAnnualReport

2% over the medium term.Primary balance: government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments onconsolidated government liabilities.Projections: the results of exercises conducted four times a year to project possible futuremacroeconomic developments in the euro area. Eurosystem staff projections are published inJune and December whereas ECB staff projections are published in March and September. They
form part of the economic analysis pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the EuropeanCentral Bank and are thus one of several inputs into the Governing Council™s assessment of therisks to price stability.Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system: a settlement system in which processing andsettlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time (continuously) (seealso TARGET).Reference value for M3 growth: the annual growth rate of M3 over the medium term that isconsistent with the maintenance of price stability. At present, the reference value for annual M3growth is 4½%.Repurchase agreement: an agreement to sell an asset and to repurchase it at a specified price ona predetermined future date or on demand. Such an agreement is similar to collateralisedborrowing, although it differs in that the seller does not retain ownership of the assets.Reserve base: the sum of the eligible balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) that constitutethe basis for calculating the reserve requirement of a credit institution.Reserve ratio: the ratio defined by the central bank for each category of eligible balance sheetitems included in the reserve base. The ratio is used to calculate reserve requirements.Reserve requirement: the minimum amount of reserves a credit institution is required to holdwith the Eurosystem. Compliance is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balancesover a maintenance period of around one month.Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under arepurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.226ECBAnnualReport

objective for Member States.Standing facility: a central bank facility available to counterparties on their own initiative. TheEurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the marginal lending facility and thedeposit facility.Straight-through processing (STP): the automated end-to-end processing of trades/paymenttransfers including the automated completion of generation, confirmation, clearing and
