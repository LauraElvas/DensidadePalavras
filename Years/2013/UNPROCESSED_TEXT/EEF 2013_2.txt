EDITORIAL
The signs of hope that we saw last spring have started to turn into tangible positive outcomes. After six
consecutive quarters of stagnation or contraction, the EU economy has posted positive growth in the
second quarter of 2013. The recovery is expected to continue, and to gather some speed next year.
However, it is too early to declare the crisis over. Growth is set to remain subdued on account of various
adjustment needs. Risks and uncertainty remain elevated. Policy action continues to be warranted to
improve the growth outlook going forward and to make the EU economy more resilient to domestic and
external shocks.
In recent months, the composition of global economic growth has shifted, and the external environment
for the EU economy has become more challenging. Growth in some key emerging market economies has
slowed down: triggered by the anticipation of less expansive monetary policies in the US, structural
weaknesses have surfaced and financial-market volatility has ensued. Many emerging markets appear
vulnerable to sudden stops of external financing. In the first half of 2013, advanced economies have made
a larger contribution to global growth than emerging markets. Economic activity has accelerated in the
US and Japan, but a medium-term strategy for putting public finances back on a sustainable path is still
missing, and the US might be headed for a damaging repetition of the stand-off over the debt ceiling.
Europe has meanwhile also returned to positive GDP growth. Whereas one and a half years ago a risk of
catastrophic outcomes was tangible, and even a break-up of the euro area seemed imaginable, such tail
risks have now all but disappeared. But also within the EU, the recovery occurs at multiple speeds, and
the previous "core-periphery" pattern has become more diversified. Growth in the coming quarters will
still be held back by the deleveraging needs, financial fragmentation, sectoral adjustment and high
unemployment associated with the crisis legacy. These impediments to growth are not expected to
disappear over the forecast horizon. But they will gradually weaken. Balance-sheet repair has to continue
among banks, non-financial firms and households, but it will be easier in a context of expanding
economic activity. Following the substantial fiscal effort in 2011 and 2012, the intensity of fiscal
consolidation has been reduced in 2013 and is expected to further wane in the coming years. Internal and
external adjustment are progressing. Net exports contribute substantially to the turnaround in Member
States that previously posted large current-account deficits.
Further policy effort is needed to accompany the various dimensions of adjustment, remove
vulnerabilities to internal and external shocks and increase the sustainable pace of growth going forward.
Delivery is essential to underpin the recovery and stay clear of tensions in financial markets and feedback
loops between the financial sector and public finances. The most immediate issue at the European level is
therefore the completion of the Banking Union. This is not only needed to strengthen macro-financial
stability by breaking the feedback loops between sovereigns and banks. It is also crucial in order to
overcome financial fragmentation. Within a monetary union with well-integrated financial markets, firms
with a similar risk profile should face similar credit conditions and interest rates irrespective of the
Member State in which they are located. That this is currently not the case penalises in particular SMEs,
which are key to overcoming the unemployment challenge. In fiscal policy, the focus should further be
shifted from the quantity towards the quality of the adjustment. At the Member State level, the drive for
structural reform has to be maintained – and in some cases should be more ambitious – in order to allow
the recovery to shift up a gear and to repair the damage that the crisis has caused to potential output.
Determined policy follow-through and implementation at European and Member-State level could also do
a lot to further reduce the still elevated uncertainty that is weighing on investment and consumption.

OVERVIEW
A slow recovery has
set in

The EU economy has returned to positive GDP growth. Following a slow and
still vulnerable expansion of economic activity during the remainder of 2013,
growth is set to become gradually more domestic demand-driven and more
robust in the course of 2014 and into 2015. The legacy of the crisis –
deleveraging, financial fragmentation, elevated uncertainty and rebalancing
needs – will continue weighing on growth. Its impact is however expected to
gradually subside over the forecast horizon as progress is made with the
correction of the accumulated macroeconomic imbalances, and domestic
demand is expected to take over as the main engine of growth. External
demand is expected to pick up over the coming quarters, but less than earlier
expected, on account of a weakened outlook for growth in emerging market
economies and the appreciation of the euro. Reflecting the carry-over from
the weakness of economic activity last winter, GDP in annual terms is
expected to remain unchanged in the EU and contract by ½% in the euro area
in 2013. Next year, economic activity is projected to expand by 1½% in the
EU and 1% in the euro area before accelerating to 2% and 1¾%, respectively,

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

in 2015. Only a very modest improvement of the labour-market situation is
expected over the forecast horizon.
Shifting patterns in the
global economy…

On the back of an acceleration of economic growth in major advanced
economies and a marked deceleration in a number of emerging market
economies, in the first half of 2013 the latter have no longer provided the
largest contribution to global GDP growth. In the US, the underlying growth
dynamics remain robust despite the short-term impact of fiscal tightening and
the uncertainty related to the only postponed debt ceiling issue, while
uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy has caused volatility in
international financial markets. In Japan, near-term growth is boosted by
monetary and fiscal stimuli. By contrast, structural weaknesses and
imbalances in emerging markets suggest that the pace of GDP growth
realised in recent years cannot be maintained over the medium term. They
have increasingly come under the scrutiny of international investors, and, as
the prospect of less accommodative US monetary policy has sent benchmark
interest rates higher, capital outflows have exacerbated the reduction of
growth prospects in emerging markets.
Overall, the external environment has become somewhat more challenging
than projected last spring. Economic activity outside the EU is now expected
to grow at a more measured pace than anticipated half a year ago, at 3½% in
2013, accelerating to 4% in 2014 and 4½% in 2015. Reflecting the trade
intensity of GDP growth in emerging market economies, world trade growth
is revised down to 2¾% in 2013, 5¼% in 2014 and 6% in 2015. At the same
time, oil prices have increased above the levels assumed in May, though they
are assumed to decrease gradually, and the nominal effective exchange rate
of the euro assumed to prevail in 2014 is now 3% higher than last spring
(based on the technical assumption of unchanged nominal exchange rates).

… and within the EU

The projections for the EU and euro-area aggregates mask substantial
differences of growth and – even more so – labour market perspectives across
Member States. These reflect the unequal severity of the initial crisis and the
related differences in adjustment needs, as well as more long-standing trends
in the determinants of potential growth. Among EU Member States, some
small open economies (e.g. the Lithuania and Latvia) have resumed the
catching-up process, and some countries of the euro-area "core" (e.g. Austria
and Germany) are emerging from a temporary slowdown with strong growth
prospects over the coming quarters. Other countries of the so-called "core"
(e.g. Finland and the Netherlands) have experienced a double-dip recession
and are faced with more subdued growth prospects. The picture is even less
homogeneous for the vulnerable and programme countries, among which
Ireland is expected to register growth above the EU average, Portugal has
technically moved out of recession in the second quarter and others are
projected to emerge from recession in the second half of 2013, e.g. Spain and
Italy. At the same time, the internal and external adjustment in vulnerable
Member States is progressing, underpinned in many cases by significant
structural reforms and fiscal consolidation implemented in recent years, and
the burden of the crisis legacy is starting to weigh less heavily on economic
activity.
Among the largest Member States, the expansion of economic activity in
Germany is set to continue on the back of robust private consumption and
construction activity as well as a gradual pick-up in equipment investment. In
France, consumption is expected to remain resilient, supported by relatively
low inflation, while investment is projected to recover gradually and

Overview

unemployment to persist. Domestic demand in Italy is expected to recover
only very gradually, supported by improving confidence, while external
demand is set to accelerate. In Spain, GDP growth is turning positive, as
strong exports provide an impulse for investment in equipment and domestic
demand exerts less of a drag. A muted recovery is expected in the
Netherlands in 2014 as investment is projected to recover slowly but steadily,
and exports provide support, while consumption continues to be held back by
deleveraging and the housing-market adjustment. Outside the euro area,
robust growth in the United Kingdom is expected to continue as consumption
continues to expand, investment improves and net exports turn somewhat
positive. Finally, in Poland, consumption is expected to pick up on the back
of growing employment and rising wages, and investment is set to rebound
allowing domestic demand to replace net exports as the main driver of
growth.
Financial frictions

…

Financial market developments in the EU have been generally benign in
recent months, despite an increase in benchmark yields and international
financial-market volatility related to the perspective of a less accommodative
stance of US monetary policy. However, credit to firms has continued
contracting, and the improvement suggested by survey data is set to be very
gradual. Very ample average financing conditions still contrast with
substantially higher loan rates and more difficult access to credit in some
euro-area Member States. This financial fragmentation is rooted in
continuing deleveraging in the banking sector as well as the constrained
access of some banks to interbank refinancing, which is expected to recede
only very gradually over the forecast horizon. For now, decreasing banklending volumes appear to be largely explained by low credit demand, but
supply is a binding constraint in some Member States and may become more
so once firms will want to expand investment at a faster pace. Differences in
lending rates are expected to narrow further on the back of decreasing
sovereign-yield spreads. Bank balance-sheet repair is a precondition for the
normalisation of credit growth. In the short-run however, banks that attempt
to shrink their balance sheets may remain restrictive in their credit conditions.

… as domestic
demand is still
affected by the crisis
legacy

Households and non-financial corporations in a number of Member States
also continue to be faced with a debt overhang holding back private
consumption and investment. High debt levels will take time to be reduced.
Improving prospects for incomes and profit should however help the
deleveraging process.
In addition to deleveraging, uncertainty, and frictions related to the
reallocation of resources in the process of adjustment of internal and external
imbalances continue to affect domestic demand. Growth expectations have
improved as indicated by the strong recovery of business and consumer
confidence. Indicators of economic and policy uncertainty by contrast have
receded but remain at elevated levels. Firms and households may thus still be
reluctant to take irreversible investment and consumption decisions.
Internal and external rebalancing continues to progress in Member States
with previously large current-account deficits underpinned by substantial
competitiveness gains over the past years. As their current accounts have
started registering surpluses while those of traditional surplus countries have
not decreased, the EU and euro-area aggregate current accounts are
displaying increasing surpluses. Frictions related to the reallocation of
resources in the process of internal adjustment are still expected to weigh on

growth in the short run. This drag should gradually fade, but the high levels
of unemployment and unused resources will take time to be absorbed.
All in all, the projected growth of domestic demand remains subdued. Both
total investment and private consumption are expected to continue their
gradual expansion over the coming quarters. But while investment is
projected to pick up more strongly towards the end of the forecast horizon on
the back of higher capacity utilisation, improved financing conditions and
increasing profits, consumption growth is set to remain modest and below its
long-term trend, as employment and wages are set to increase only slowly.
The dynamics of domestic demand are however expected to be sufficient to
make it the main driver of GDP growth already next year.

4

Slower pace of fiscal
consolidation

Following the front-loaded fiscal consolidation in the EU, in particular in the
years 2011 and 2012, the pressure from fiscal adjustment has now started
decreasing. The change in the structural deficit in both the EU and the euro
area is expected to have declined to ½% of GDP in 2013 and is expected to
decrease further to ¼% of GDP next year. As of next year, a combination of
expiring temporary tax hikes, planned tax cuts and lower cyclical expenditure
is expected to shift the improvement of public finances more towards the
expenditure side. The debt-to-GDP ratio is now expected to peak in 2014, at
90% in the EU and 96% in the euro area.

Labour market
improvement at a
snail's pace

Unemployment has stabilised at high levels for the past half year, as
employment losses have petered out. Employment expectations in
manufacturing and services have started improving from low levels.
However, an early turnaround of the labour market is not expected. Rather,
employment is set to follow the recovery of GDP growth with a lag as firms
have scope to increase hours worked before hiring new staff and uncertainty
also weighs on hiring decisions. Employment in the EU and the euro area is
projected to expand by ¼% in 2014, which will not yet be sufficient to curb
high unemployment. In 2015, employment growth is set to accelerate to ¾%
in both areas, resulting in a slight reduction of unemployment to 10¾% in the
EU and 11¾% in the euro area. The differences in labour-market
performance across Member States are expected to remain extremely large,
with unemployment expected to range from 5% in Austria to 26½% in Spain
in 2014.

Low and stable
inflation ahead

On the back of easing energy price increases, consumer-price inflation has
continued to slow down in the course of 2013, standing at 1.5% in the EU
and 1.3% in the euro area in the third quarter. Core inflation (i.e. excluding
energy and unprocessed food), which has also decreased slightly reflecting
the weakness of domestic demand, is expected to remain stable in 2014,
picking up only slightly towards the end of the forecast horizon on account of
a slow reduction in output gaps. The impact of past increases of taxes and
administered prices on headline inflation will continue to fade in the coming
quarters. Under the technical assumption of slowly decreasing oil prices and
unchanged exchange rates, headline inflation is expected to remain at the
current low levels over the forecast horizon.

Lower domestic but
higher external risks

Irrespective of the mostly positive news coming from the latest economic
data, downside risks to the GDP forecast still prevail as the macro-financial
situation remains fragile. Domestically, the continued implementation of
structural reforms and further steps to strengthen the EMU architecture
remain crucial to prevent a return of stress in financial markets and negative
feedback loops. However, risks to the integrity of the euro area have all but

Overview

disappeared over the past 15 months, and more upside risks have recently
emerged. In particular, a positive feedback loop could emerge between
confidence, investment and credit; or already implemented structural reforms
could bear fruit earlier than expected. At the same time, negative risks on the
external side have increased. The EU might become affected to a larger
extent than in recent months and currently expected for the time ahead by
volatility and risk aversion in international financial markets. The uncertainty
related to the path of monetary and fiscal policy in the US could lead to larger
spillovers through financial markets, confidence and real-economy linkages.
The risks to the inflation outlook are broadly balanced. On the one hand,
geopolitical tensions could lead to a surge in energy prices and higher
imported inflation. On the other hand, the recent decrease in core inflation,
which had remained remarkably stable in the presence of large output gaps
over the past years, could lead to a downward adjustment of short-term
inflation expectations.

Economic developments at the aggregated
level

EMERGING FROM RECESSION
In the second quarter of 2013, GDP has started to expand in the EU and in the euro area by 0.3% q-o-q,
signalling the end of recession. Economic indicators for the EU have provided mostly positive signals
since April, and suggest a continued but modest expansion in the second half of the year. The recovery
remains subdued and fragile as the impediments stemming from the financial and economic crisis
continue weighing on economic activity, while the global growth outlook has weakened.
Based on the assumption that continued policy effort will sustain improvements in business and
consumer confidence, financial conditions and Member States' economic adjustment capacity, economic
activity in the EU is expected to continue recovering in the coming quarters. But major drags acting on
domestic demand will fade only gradually. Despite financing conditions that are benign on average,
financial fragmentation has led to large differences across Member States and across firms of different
size, and bank lending has continued to contract. The speed of fiscal consolidation is expected to slow
down but further private-sector deleveraging is still likely in a number of Member States. Frictions
related to the on-going adjustment processes exacerbate unemployment and the under-utilisation of
capital. Still elevated uncertainty hampers private investment and consumption. As a result, domestic
demand is expected to turn into a key motor of growth only very slowly. Meanwhile, on the back of
continued price competitiveness gains in a number of Member States, exports are expected to remain
supportive to growth, albeit the euro has appreciated and the economic outlook in emerging markets
has weakened.
A moderate expansion of economic activity is expected in the second half of 2013 amid low inflation
pressures. As lingering effects from the crisis are expected to fade only gradually and financial
fragmentation recedes, economic activity is expected to accelerate moderately in 2014 to around 1½%
in the EU and 1% in the euro area, before growing more robustly in 2015 at respectively close to 2%
and 1¾%, as also the positive impact of undertaken structural reforms starts showing more visibly. The
recovery is expected to occur at multiple speeds with diverging growth patterns outside the EU and
persistent growth differentials across EU Member States.
Headline inflation has decreased markedly in the first three quarters of 2013, on the back of slower
energy-price increases and gradually easing core inflation. In 2013, HICP inflation is expected to ease
to 1.7% in the EU and 1.5% in the euro area and to remain close to 1½% in both areas in 2014-15.
Risks have become more balanced over recent months but downside risks to economic activity continue
to prevail. Compared to a year ago, tail risks related to the sovereign-debt crisis have faded, but risks in
the external environment, stemming notably from fiscal-policy uncertainty in the US and vulnerabilities
in emerging market economies, have risen. The risks to the inflation outlook appear broadly balanced.

1.

AT THE EARLY STAGES OF A GRADUAL
AND MULTI-SPEED RECOVERY

The second quarter of 2013 is likely to have
marked the end of the protracted recession that
started at the end of 2011 and was linked to the
financial crisis and the unsustainable debt
developments. In the second quarter, the euro
area (1) witnessed GDP growth for the first time
since six quarters, while the EU (2) showed a
marked expansion after a year and a half of either
falling or stagnating GDP. The latest readings of
leading indicators suggest a continuation of the
recovery, showing positive signals that the longawaited recovery is eventually materialising. In
addition to this improvement in short-term
indicators, the recent revival of domestic demand
in the second quarter might even point to stronger
underlying economic dynamics than envisaged in
spring.
However, balance sheet recessions tend to be
characterised by deeper downturns as well as
shallower recoveries and are often associated with
substantial and permanent output losses. While
potential output growth is expected to recover
gradually, the negative shift of the output level
related to the double-dip recession is likely to be
permanent (3). In mid-2013 GDP in the EU and the
euro area is respectively 2.4% and 3.1% below the
pre-crisis levels of early 2008. As growth is
expected to strengthen only gradually over the
forecast horizon, at the end of 2015, cumulated
losses in the level of the euro-area GDP as
compared to its pre-crisis and actual trends will
still be of a large magnitude (see Graph I.3).
Revisions to the spring 2013 forecast are mild and
the earlier projection that growth would
increasingly be driven by domestic demand is
confirmed.

The multi-speed recovery …

The aggregate picture of a gradual recovery in the
EU over the coming quarters masks marked
differences in developments across Member States.
While growth performance among the Member
States of the euro-area "periphery" has been
heterogeneous for some time, growing divergences
have meanwhile emerged within the "core" (see
Graph I.4). Some countries as Germany and
Austria, but also Poland experienced only shortlived slowdowns and are expected to resume solid
growth early on. The strongest growth over the
forecast horizon is projected in small exportoriented economies where the process of real
convergence is expected to resume. Other Member
States are emerging only gradually from deep
recessions or prolonged stagnation. However,
some signs of a turnaround are also visible in the
vulnerable countries with output decline slowing in
the second quarter and growth turning positive in
some. Over the forecast horizon, the recovery is
expected to become broad-based.
The Netherlands, and to a lesser extent Finland,
have over recent quarters experienced more
protracted and steeper declines of GDP than
Germany and France. The relatively weak outlook
for the Netherlands reflects a decline in property
prices and a protracted balance sheet adjustment of
highly indebted households. Also for vulnerable
countries, the outlook has brightened. Among
them, the Irish economy is projected to outgrow its
peers at a rate above the EU average, thanks to
improved labour and property markets. Spain is
also expected to have exited the recession, though
its growth prospects for the near-term are still
subdued, given the still large adjustment needs that
constrain the strength of the recovery.

… reflects a differentiated legacy from the
crisis as well as longer-standing trends …

During the 2008-09 recession and to a lesser extent
during the 2011-12 sovereign-debt crisis, large
spillovers via financial markets, trade and
confidence (4) added to country-specific challenges.
As economic activity in the EU gradually resumes
growing, country-specific determinants of
economic growth are again becoming more visible
and are expected to shape the pattern of the
recovery going forward.
In some Member States, housing markets and the
construction sector are still in the process of
adjusting. More generally, the size of internal and
external imbalances following significant increases
in debt in the pre-crisis period is related to the
consequent need to repair balance sheets of private
and public agents, though the speed of that
adjustment also differs across countries. Negative
feedback-loops between private-sector debt
overhangs, bank funding problems and
government financing constraints still exist and
constitute a risk to economic prospects over the
forecast horizon.
Deleveraging needs among households and nonfinancial corporations continue to be substantial at
the current juncture. Generally, savings have
adjusted, but further progress is needed to redress
the large cumulated stocks of external debt and
improve private sector balance sheets. The pace
(4)

integration and the international propagation of shocks,
Economic Policy, Volume 27, Issue 70, pages 319-359,
April 2012.

predictor of consumption spending: evidence for the US
and the euro area, International economics, Volume 134,
August 2013, pages 1-14.

and extent of the required adjustment varies,
however, across countries. At a sectoral level, the
majority of the recent adjustment can be attributed
to households' deleveraging efforts. Flows have
also adjusted in the non-financial corporate sector,
which has posted net savings since 2010.
However, the debt-to-GDP ratios in both the
corporate and the household sectors remain high
and they adjust very slowly (also due to a
denominator effect) so that deleveraging needs are
still sizeable. Over the forecast horizon, improved
prospects for incomes and profits, as well as the
return of GDP growth should help a further
decrease in debt ratios, but deleveraging will
continue weighing on domestic demand.
The need for front-loaded fiscal consolidation in
the countries under market pressure had a
detrimental impact on growth in the short-term but
is expected to unfold its positive impact in the
medium-term. Substantial improvements in public
finances have been achieved in the EU in the years
2011 and 2012 with differentiated budgetary
adjustments under the strengthened EU
framework. Going forward, the speed of fiscal
consolidation is set to decrease.
… as well as different adjustment needs in the
financial sector…

Large adjustment needs in the financial sector
exacerbate the prevailing financial frictions.
Although bank-funding conditions have generally
improved, access to longer-term funding at
sustainable costs remains a challenge for several
small euro-area banks, in particular in Member
States that remain under intense market scrutiny
due to lingering concerns about fiscal
sustainability. Moreover, banks that find it difficult
to improve their capital position (for example by
retaining earnings or raising capital on financial
markets) may still be reluctant to extend credit to
the private sector. Banks have also tended to
prioritise deleveraging on their cross-border
activity and to ring-fence their domestic business.
Different public and private deleveraging needs,
negative feedback loops between the sovereign and
the banking sectors, and links between financial
and non-financial private sector deleveraging have
led to financial fragmentation within the euro area.
This has resulted in persistent differences in
borrowing cost and credit availability across
Member States that are difficult to explain by
differences in risk alone.

11

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

Although financing conditions in the EU are
overall benign, credit constraints related to
financial fragmentation also weigh on the
reallocation of resources from the production of
non-tradable goods and services towards tradables
in Member States that had large current-account
deficits in the run-up to the crisis. This bears the
risk of long unemployment spells and an
associated loss of skills. Looking forward,
however, financial fragmentation should gradually
recede further in line with easing tensions in
sovereign-debt markets and slowly vanishing
frictions in the banking sector.
The relative ease at which vulnerable Member
States can attenuate the impact of private sector
deleveraging on economic activity and switch
towards more export-oriented industries as an
engine for growth depends, however, not only on
the direct impact of the financial crisis on credit
markets, but also on long-standing structural
features. Rigidities in labour and product markets
have hindered competitiveness adjustment,
efficient resource allocation and productivity
growth and partly explain the divergence in
potential growth rates across Member States.
Moreover, inefficiencies in the insolvency
framework for households and firms may have
slowed down deleveraging, delaying losses
recognition and impeding credit flows for solvent
corporates and individuals. Recently, however,
many
vulnerable
Member
States
have
implemented wide-ranging reforms to correct the
imbalances built in the past and shift the economy
onto a more sustainable growth path. (5) Some
reforms in the labour market have already started
to pay off, notably reforms that allow real wages to
better play in favour of the re-absorption of
unemployment (6), or pension and tax and benefit
systems reforms that might explain part of the
increased participation of elderly workers. All in
all, the positive impact of the substantial reforms
undertaken is expected to become gradually more
important over the forecast horizon.

In addition to the divergent output developments,
the difference of unemployment rates across
countries is driven by different responses of
employment to output. In the crisis years, various
factors including structural and institutional
features linked to employment regulations,
intensity of temporary employment, or presence of
short-term working schemes, might have
accounted for most deviations of unemployment
changes from Okun-law predictions. However,
since 2012 employers' expectations on the
economic outlook seem also to have played a
major role, notably in the countries experiencing
deleveraging and credit tightening. There, the
labour market worsened more than what can be
explained on the basis of GDP growth. An
additional factor explaining the cross-country
differences could also be the ongoing corporate
balance sheet repairs. In fact, during the corporate
balance-sheet adjustment process, companies
reduced equipment investment and cut costs to
raise
profitability,
lowering
employment,
particularly in Member States under the most
intense market pressure and/or with limited wage
flexibility. (7)
The varying labour market situation across
countries is also reflected in diverging wage
developments. Since 2011, real wages increases
have lagged behind productivity growth in most
high-unemployment countries facing substantial
internal and external adjustment needs. Looking
ahead, wage moderation is set to continue in
vulnerable Member States, allowing for a further
improvement in price competitiveness. By
contrast, a rise in unit labour costs was observed in
countries with relatively low unemployment rates
and real wages per head are set to grow faster than
in the pre-crisis years in Germany.

differences persisting…

Economic developments at the aggregated level

widely questioned. Since then, on the back of the
decisive political achievements in terms of crisismanagement and reforms of the economic
governance in the euro-area, uncertainty has
receded but remains elevated. Uncertainty can
depress economic activity by giving households
and
companies
incentives
to
postpone
consumption and investment decisions. (8) At the
current juncture, receding but still high uncertainty
adds to more structural weaknesses that weigh on
the recovery such as banks' weak balance sheets
and companies' deleveraging needs. (9) Recently,
financial markets appear to have become less
sensitive to adverse policy news from vulnerable
countries supporting the hypothesis that the
available policy instruments for crisis management
have proved effective so far. Under the assumption
of smooth policy implementation, uncertainty is
expected to continue its gradual decline over the
coming quarters.

The divergence in momentum between emerging
and advanced economies is mirrored in recent
trade data. The latest CPB data show that the
merchandise trade volumes have increased in
advanced economies, at the fastest rate over the
last two and a half years in July, while the trade
momentum in emerging markets has weakened
considerably since November 2012. Looking
forward, trade volumes are expected to accelerate
modestly, reflecting the gradual pick-up in global
activity, notably in advanced economies. Non-EU
export volumes are expected to grow by 3.6% in
2013, and then accelerate to 5.7% in 2014 and to
6.0% in 2015.

Global growth picked up in the second quarter of
2013 to 0.4% q-o-q, the highest quarterly growth
rate since the start of 2012. Despite this pick-up in
activity the global outlook has weakened due
mainly to underperformance in a number of
emerging market economies (EMEs). This
weakness implies a reduction in non-EU growth in
2013 and 2014 as compared to the spring forecast
(see Box I.1). Non-EU growth is now expected to
be 3.5% in 2013 rising to 4.1% in 2014 and to
4.4% in 2015.
In sharp contrast to recent years, when emerging
markets were the main driver of global growth, the
relative contribution of advanced economies in the
first half of 2013 was significant and growing. In
the second quarter, they even accounted for two
thirds of global growth. Looking ahead, survey
indicators suggest a persistence of this pattern.
While in recent months, Purchasing Managers'
Indices (PMIs) in advanced economy have edged
up, the composite PMI for emerging markets has
been trending down since 2010, though it has
slightly improved in September (see Graph I.5).

The underlying mechanism would be that it forces banks to
restrain credit further and companies to hold back
investment, even if not liquidity constrained, to minimise
the risks of irreversible decisions.

Emerging markets to grow less robustly than in
the past

The latest GDP readings have disappointed most
notably in Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and India.
China's GDP also saw a slight deceleration in the
second quarter, but it was counterbalanced by a
slight acceleration in the third, suggesting that on
average, growth appears to be stabilising at around
7.5%, compared to growth rates of above 9% in
the recent past. The drivers of the recent economic
slowdown vary, and both cyclical and structural
factors are at work. In China and Russia the
growth models that allowed for past good
economic performances seem to have reached
some limit. The overreliance of the Russian model
on commodities does not appear sustainable, and
without modernising the economy subdued growth
is expected. In China, smoothly shifting the growth
model from investment spending towards
consumption spending seems a more viable way to
ensure strong economic expansion in the longerterm. Besides, in the first half of 2013, in Russia
and Mexico domestic investment has been
extremely weak, while in India and Brazil tighter

weighing heavily on consumer and business

Looking ahead, the recent rise in global benchmark

stringently into account. A further gradual
normalisation of global monetary conditions is

This is subject to the assumption that a consensus
regarding fiscal policies will emerge going
forward. In Japan, the good performance of the
first half of 2013 is likely to be maintained through
the rest of the year and into 2014. Economic
expansion is expected to be underpinned by the ongoing recovery in private non-residential
investment and resilient private consumption on
the back of continued fiscal and monetary stimuli,
which will offset most of the negative impact of
the forthcoming tax hikes on growth in 2014. All
in all, output in advanced economies outside the
EU is expected to expand by 1.8% in 2013, before
increasing more robustly by 2.5% and 2.8%, in
2014 and 2015 respectively.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Box I.1: Impact of the slowdown in emerging markets on the EU economy

Compared to the 2010-11 period, GDP growth in
several emerging market economies (EMEs) has
moderated in 2012 (1), especially in countries
with weaker macroeconomic fundamentals.
Given that economic activity in EMEs is
projected to expand at only modest rates over the
forecast horizon (see Graph 1), this box attempts
to gauge the potential impact of the EME
slowdown on the EU economy by following two
complementary lines of reasoning. More
precisely, simulations based on a generalequilibrium approach focus on the aggregate
level, while the partial analysis of trade relations
between Member States and EMEs aims to
identify possible differences across individual
EU countries.

A modest impact on the EU economy

The potential impact of the EME slowdown is
analysed by applying the revised GDP growth
projections for EMEs in the Autumn 2013
forecast as a shock to the main scenario in the
Spring 2013 forecast. (2) The simulation uses a
version of DG ECFIN's QUEST III model
including both tradable and non-tradable sectors
and three country blocks: the EU, the group of
EMEs that are the main EU trading partners (i.e.
Brazil, Russia, India, China, Hong Kong, South
Korea, Turkey, Mexico, Middle East and
Northern Africa) and the rest of the world. (3)

- Spring 2013.
Details on the QUEST III model and its use for
policy
analysis
are
available
at
http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/research/macro
economic_models_en.htm.

The analysis assumes that monetary policy in
advanced economies does not react to lower
import demand from EMEs and the resulting
lower price pressures by reducing interest rates.
Weighted by the share of the individual EME in
total EU exports to emerging markets, the EME
slowdown is associated with a contraction in EU
export markets in EMEs by 0.9% in 2013 and by
another 0.9% in 2014 compared to the spring
projections. Over the whole 2-year period, this
implies a decline in EU export markets in the
EMEs by 1.7%.

The aggregate spillover to real GDP growth in
the EU is -0.1% in 2013 and another -0.1% in
2014, so that EU real GDP is 0.2% below the
baseline in 2014 (see Table 1) (4). The EME
slowdown does not only affect EU export
growth, as indicated by the deterioration of the
trade balance, but also domestic demand
(see Graph 2). Lower domestic demand is the
result of rising real interest rates that are implied
by unchanged policy rates and declining price
pressures.
Downside risks could add to the deterioration in
EMEs' growth, such as a further deceleration of
global demand, a sharp fall in investment in
China, or further monetary policy tightening
warranted by inflation developments in India or
Brazil. In order to capture the impact of these
potential negative developments on the EU
economy, a downside scenario is also examined,
in which the initial shock to EMEs' GDP is
assumed to be significantly larger: tradeweighted annual EME growth is revised
downwards by 1.9 pps. instead of 0.9 pp. In such
a downside scenario, the impact on the EU
economy would approximately double and real
GDP would be 0.4% below the baseline level by
end-2014.
(4)

The aggregate impact includes first-round effects
from EME domestic demand slowdown on EME
demand for EU exports as well as effects of related
relative price adjustment and indirect spillovers via
the rest of the world on EU trade and activity.

Taken together, the growth spillover from an
EME slowdown to EU GDP is rather modest
given the relatively limited trade exposure of the
aggregate EU economy to EMEs. The
deceleration could however affect individual
Member States to different degrees, depending
on their geographical export orientation and
trade openness.

As a complement to the general-equilibrium
approach in the previous section, a partialequilibrium analysis based on trade flows
between EU Member States and their major
trade partners in emerging markets was
conducted in order to capture cross-country
differences in the exposure to an EME
slowdown. The trade channel analysis assumes
unit elasticity of imports with respect to GDP: a
1% reduction in the GDP levels of emerging
markets is associated with a 1% decrease in their
imports from the EU, implying a 1% fall in
Member States' exports to those markets. Due to
the limited availability of data on services
exports, the analysis is based on a trade matrix
compiling the 2012 goods exports (5) of
individual Member States to each of the twelve
largest EME trade partners. (6)
The purpose of the trade channel analysis is to
qualify, rather than quantify, divergences across
Member states in GDP exposure to an EME

The countries included are China, Russia, Turkey,
Brazil, India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, the United

and Singapore. Altogether, these countries account
for about 60% of EU exports to non-advanced
economies and nearly 40% of total extra-EU exports.

slowdown. Obtaining precise estimates of the
overall impact on Member States' GDP is
therefore outside the scope of the study. First,
this would require the trade matrix to
differentiate between (i) the exports of goods
manufactured in a Member State and (ii) reexports of goods in transit to a different enddestination country, as the latter inflate export
volumes in trade hubs (Rotterdam-Antwerp
effect). Second, other factors would have to be
taken into account, such as spillovers between
Member States, repercussions on capital flows,
or second-round GDP effects, i.e. the
transmission from external trade to domestic
demand.
Among the twelve emerging economies included
in the analysis, EU exports appear particularly
vulnerable to a potential slowdown in China,
Russia and Turkey, as these three markets
represent 20% of total extra-EU goods exports
and 2.3% of EU GDP (see Graph 3). The study
of the trade matrix shows that trade ties with
emerging markets are highly heterogeneous
across Member States: while the twelve selected
EME trade partners account for more than 50%
of extra-EU exports in the case of Latvia,
Estonia and Lithuania, less than 20% of
Croatian, Irish or Maltese exports to non-EU
countries are shipped to this country group
(see Graph 4).

Based on the revisions of EME growth
projections compared to the 2013 Spring
Forecast, the impact of a deceleration in EMEs
on GDP differs quite substantially across EU
Member States. Among the largest EU countries,
the direct impact of an EME slowdown would be
below the EU average for France, the United
Kingdom, Italy and Spain, while it would be
above the average in the case of Germany and
the Netherlands (see Graph 5).

states' exports to all of the selected EMEs (with
the exception of Singapore). Although the
impact of the EME deceleration would remain
limited for the EU as a whole, which is
consistent with the model-based analysis in the
previous section, it could become more
significant for some Member States, in particular
the Baltic countries.

While the downward revision of GDP growth in
Russia is less abrupt than in India, Mexico or
Saudi Arabia, the impact of the deceleration of
the Russian economy appears to be greater than
those of any other EME, owing to the fact that
Russia remains the main extra-EU trade partner
for a large number of Member States. The same
applies to China, i.e. the country is a very
important trade partner for most Member States.
But China is expected to experience only a
relatively small slowdown resulting in a limited
negative impact on Member States' GDP. By
contrast, improving prospects in Singapore, the
United Arab Emirates and Turkey are expected
to have a positive impact on the GDP of their
EU trade partners.
In the case of a downside scenario, where GDP
growth in each EME would be lower by 1 pp.
compared to the Autumn 2013 forecast, the
slowdown would result in a fall in Member

September before easing back to USD 108/bbl.

Overall, given the limited trade exposure of the
EU economy to emerging markets, the EME
slowdown appears to affect EU GDP growth
only to a modest extent. However, the magnitude
of the impact on aggregate EU GDP also
depends on the policy environment in the EU.
Given the limited fiscal and monetary space in
many EU Member States at the current juncture,
the potentially negative repercussions of the
EME deceleration on EU GDP growth are likely
to be reinforced. While indirect effects or other
transmission channels would need to be taken
into account to obtain a more precise assessment
of the potential impact on GDP levels, the trade
channel analysis highlights the extent to which
the vulnerability to the EME slowdown varies
across EU Member States.
Due to domestic factors supporting the pick-up
of activity in the EU economy, the deceleration
currently observed in EMEs does not appear to
be sufficiently large to derail the projected
further recovery of the EU economy. However,
any further deterioration of prospects in
emerging markets could jeopardise the recovery
path and put into question the recent upward
revision in the European economic outlook.

2013 and to decline to USD 105.8/bbl. in 2014 and
USD 99.7/bbl. in 2015. Other commodity markets
are set to remain bearish this year. Food prices are
projected to ease in 2013-15. Prices of metals and
raw materials are not expected to recover in 2013
due to abundant supplies and weakened demand
conditions. Moderate price gains are expected for
2014-15 in tandem with global recovery.
Global inflation is likely to remain relatively stable
over the forecast horizon. In advanced economies
outside the EU, the gradual pick-up is unlikely to
translate into higher prices and inflation is set to
remain below 2%. In the emerging markets
inflation is expected to remain around 6% on the
back of decreasing oil prices, weakness in other
commodity prices, and the fairly modest
acceleration in growth in 2014 and 2015. It should
be noted, however, that inflation rates differ
significantly across the emerging markets, and the
outlook is more dependent on supply side
constraints.

EU corporate bond spreads have narrowed
somewhat, and credit insurance costs decreased
across most sectors and risk classes. Especially for
larger corporations, bond issuance has developed
into a suitable alternative to bank lending.
Meanwhile, several emerging bond and equity
markets have underperformed significantly,
suffering from important capital outflows and
currency depreciation.

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN EUROPE

In recent months, financial markets conditions in
the EU have been marked by an increase of yields
on benchmark bonds while riskier market
segments have performed better. The eye-catching
development over the recent months has been the
trend reversal in benchmark sovereign-bond yields,
on the back of improving macroeconomic data in
the US, the UK and the EU, and a widening of the
term premium demanded by investors as safe
haven-flows abated (see Box I.3).
Signs of improvement …

In the sovereign-bond markets of vulnerable EU
Member States, more signs of stabilisation and
normalisation have emerged, amid a less negative
assessment of their macroeconomic prospects as
well as market confidence in a timely
implementation of adjustment programmes and
prospects of Banking Union (see Graph I.7).
EU and US stock markets have followed a volatile
path upwards, as improving sentiment supported
by macroeconomic data and strong corporate
earnings data was mitigated by uncertainty about
the decision for tapering of the asset purchase
programme by the US Federal Reserve.

remains

Monetary policy has remained accommodative
throughout the EU. In the euro area, in May 2013
the Governing Council of the ECB cut the main
refinancing rate to the historically low level of
0.50% (the deposit facility rate stands at 0%) and
clarified that refinancing operations would be
conducted at fixed-rate full allotment procedures
for as long as necessary, but at least until 8 July
2014. In July 2013, the Governing Council
announced that it expected "the key ECB interest
rates to remain at the present or lower levels for an
extended period of time". This forward guidance
was based on an overall subdued outlook for
inflation extending into the medium term, given
the broad-based weakness in the economy and
subdued monetary dynamics. A number of central
banks in the CEE region decreased their key
monetary policy rates, with Hungary and Romania
providing the most pronounced easing. The Bank
of England said that it intended not to raise the
Bank Rate from its current level of 0.5% and not to
reduce its stock of asset purchases financed by
central bank reserves at least until the
unemployment rate reaches 7% - provided that
inflationary pressures, medium-term inflation
expectations and risks to financial stability remain
contained.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Euro-area money market rates eased somewhat as
the upward pressure stemming from expectations
of an imminent decrease in asset purchases by the
US Federal Reserve abated. While monthly
repayments of the two 3-year LTROs (Longer
Term Refinancing Operations) had constantly
declined from January to August, they accelerated
in September.
… but financial fragmentation affects bank
funding …

While the amount of central bank liquidity
provided
through
open-market
operations
continued to decline in recent months in the euro
area – thereby suggesting a gradual improvement
in banks' funding conditions – for several smaller
banks in vulnerable euro-area Member States
getting access to medium- and longer-term funding
at sustainable costs remains a challenge. This
signals that, in spite of some progress, financial
fragmentation in the banking sector remains
significant as banks in stressed countries still have
to pay a premium on bank debt compared to their
peers in core countries. The decline in total net
issuance of bank debt securities from 2012 does
not only reflect on-going balance sheet
deleveraging and a shift towards deposit funding,
but also some banks' limited access to debt
markets. As equity issuance by euro-area banks
has only marginally increased over the last couple
of months, capital positions for several euro-area
banks remain weak.
The weak macroeconomic situation and subdued
corporate earnings, especially in countries under
stress, have lowered asset quality and generated
additional loan impairments. The rise of nonperforming loans at a faster pace than the available
provision coverage has attracted market attention
and forced banks to increase provisions.
Meanwhile banks' efforts to cut costs had only a
small effect on aggregate cost-to-income ratios, the
main gauge of their productivity. In this context,
capital generation through internal funding
remains subdued and a challenge for banks in
countries under stress.

stress tests (10) are expected to lead to the
identification and tackling of remaining
weaknesses in the banking sector and to improve
market sentiment by restoring transparency, which
is a precondition for credit growth to resume. In
the run-up, however, additional deleveraging
pressures in several euro-area countries cannot be
excluded, particularly if recapitalisation through
equity issuance remains weak.
… which is reflected in lending volumes and
conditions …

Despite some improvements in banks' funding
conditions and signs of economic recovery, in the
past months bank lending to the private sector fell
further (by -1.5% y-o-y in August, adjusted for
sales and securitisation) with lending volumes to
the non-financial corporate sector falling even
sharper (-2.9%) and loans to households growing
modestly (0.4%) supported by lending for house
purchases. Heterogeneity among euro-area
countries persists as regards lending volumes and
interest rates for enterprises.
Heterogeneity in lending conditions across euroarea countries has slightly receded but remains
high. Interest rates for loans to enterprises in core
countries like Germany and France have stopped
falling while they have slid slightly in fragile
countries like Greece and Portugal (see Graph I.8).
However, differences in interest rates for
enterprises between countries like Italy or Spain
and Germany have not yet started to narrow and
the level of differences across euro-area countries
remains overall significant.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

Box I.2: Financial fragmentation and SMEs' financing conditions
Since the introduction of the Euro and until the
outbreak of the global financial crisis, the euro area
banking sector experienced a process of
integration, mostly in capital markets and
wholesale banking. The eruption of the financial
crisis and, more specifically, the sovereign-debt
crisis has reversed this process leading, inter alia, to
weakened cross-border inter-bank lending and
more home-biased asset portfolios of banks. At the
same time, banks’ funding costs on wholesale
markets and the cost of credit insurance (CDS)
started to depend much more on the perceived
solvency of the country where the respective bank
is located as reflected by sovereign bond yields.
Financial market fragmentation (1) has become
particularly detrimental for banks located in
vulnerable Member States, which found it
increasingly difficult to obtain funding from their
counterparts in other euro area Member States. As
a consequence, the Eurosystem’s accommodative
monetary policy stance is not passing through to
bank-lending rates in a number of euro-area
countries, while lending volumes to non-financial
corporations dropped significantly in the euro area,
most notably in Spain, Portugal and Greece. (2)

economic growth and job creation, financial
fragmentation could impede the economic recovery
in the vulnerable Member States and amplify
cyclical divergences within the euro area.
The latest survey on the access to finance of SMEs
in the euro area (SAFE) (4) shows that vulnerable
countries (Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal)
reported the largest share of SMEs indicating that
access to finance is their greatest concern at the
current juncture. Firms in these countries also
mention more frequently that interest rate expenses
are increasing, in line with ECB data which
illustrate that particularly firms in the southern euro
area face higher borrowing rates on loans below a
volume of 1m EUR, a proxy usually used for loans
to SMEs (see Graph 1). The survey also shows that
SMEs are confronted with higher rejection rates
compared with larger corporations, a feature
magnified in vulnerable Member States.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are
usually more exposed to economic downturns and
asymmetric shocks as they are typically more
specialized, sectorally and geographically. In
addition, SME funding is particularly dependent on
bank lending: unlike large corporations, they have
hardly access to any alternative sources of
financing. (3) Given that SMEs are essential for
(1)

Financial fragmentation could be defined as
differences in the functioning and performance of
financial markets of different jurisdictions caused by
obstacles to the free movement of capital and/or
financial services across borders. For a more detailed
analysis on fragmentation, see European Economic
Forecast, Autumn 2012, Box 1.2: Assessing the
impact of diverging financing conditions within the
euro area, pp. 34-36 and Al-Eyd, A. and S. Pelin

Euro Area, IMF Working Paper No 13/208, October
2013.
See ECB, Assessing the retail interest rate pass

fragmentation, Monthly Bulletin, August 2013, pp.
75-91.
Smaller firms are over-proportionally subject to
financial constraints, see for example Iyer, R. et al.,
Interbank liquidity crunch and the firm credit crunch:
Evidence from the 2007-2009 crisis, Barcelona GSE
Working Paper, No. 867, April 2013.

While banks generally charge higher rates for loans
to SMEs than for loans to larger corporations, this
interest-spread has increased in the euro area,

the real economy: Perceived access to bank loans for
EU firms in times of crisis, in: European
Commission, Product Market Review 2013
(forthcoming). In the Commission's annual
investment survey at the end of 2012 manufacturing
firms from vulnerable Member States reported that
financing conditions were less favourable compared
to those in core countries. The size breakdown,
however, did not suggest that SMEs were
systematically more affected than large corporations.

in core countries (Germany, France, Finland, and
Belgium). (7) The visible cross-country differences
in profitability as measured by the after-tax return
on assets (ROA) for both manufacturing and
services firms indicate that part of the difference in
lending rates may be explained by the SMEs’
different credit risks (see Graph 3).

Bank lending volumes have significantly declined
in the euro area periphery, but there is no clear
indication that lending volumes for SMEs have
fallen more rapidly than those for larger
enterprises. However, this comparison may be
misleading because larger enterprises crucially
benefit from the access to market funding via bond
issuance which they have intensively used as a
complement or substitute for bank loans in the past
years.
Alongside financial fragmentation on the loan
supply side, other factors such as cross-country
differences in SME's profitability or indebtedness
are acting on both supply and demand of credit and
are likely to contribute to the divergence in interest
rates and lending volumes. The identification of the
particular impact of financial fragmentation on
credit-market conditions thus requires controlling
for SMEs' fundamental variables. The subsequent
analysis shows that there are still differences in
funding conditions between comparable enterprises
that are located in two different euro area countries.
The sample (6) covers independent SMEs (no
majority-controlled subsidiaries) in vulnerable
countries (Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece) and
(5)

(6)

According to qualitative information, there was a
pronounced increase in the rate of loans to riskier
SMEs, which suggests that the average rates recorded
in statistics may give a too benign picture of the
credit costs many SMEs are facing, see Institute of
International Finance (IIF)/Bain & Company,
Restoring Financing and Growth to Europe's SMEs,
2013.
Firm-level data are from the ORBIS database.

Controlling for differences in profitability is
important because SMEs' profitability acts on both
the supply and the demand side of the bank credit
market. On the supply side, banks request a higher
risk premium for loans to businesses with lower
profitability, while loan demand can also be
negatively affected by low profitability, particularly
when SMEs are facing generally high funding
costs. The firm-level data on profitability suggest
that SMEs in core countries are more profitable
(7)

Results need to be interpreted with caution given
cross-country differences in firm coverage in the
database, reflecting both differences in the number of
existing firms and different institutional frameworks
on data reporting.

Box (continued)

than those in vulnerable Member States (8) but that
profitability declined moderately in almost all
countries covered between 2006 and 2011 (last
available financial year in the database). The only
exception is Greece, which experienced a sharp
deterioration. Differences in profitability are
therefore rather country-specific and cannot be
sufficiently explained by different cyclical patterns
across the euro area. Instead, they could be due to,
for example, the share of value-added in the
produced goods, the technology used (the mix of
capital and labour), R&D (and the possibility to
finance it) and country infrastructures and
institutional differences.
Next, SMEs’ financing conditions are assessed by
examining whether firms' investment levels
correctly reflect their fundamentals. This analysis is
based on the assumption that funding flows are
typically used for investment purposes. (9) The
approach consists of comparing the investment
rates of SMEs in the vulnerable countries to those
of their closest possible match among firms
operating in core countries. Specifically, the
matching procedure looks for the most similar firm
operating in Germany, France, Finland, or Belgium
within the same industry as the vulnerable country's
firm, and with the closest possible fundamentals:
profitability, sales growth, company size, capital
intensity and leverage.
Table 1 presents the results for two important
industries: (i) the construction sector is an example
of a disinvesting sector (at least in countries like
Spain); (ii) the manufacturing industry, which
produces mainly tradable goods, is more reliant on
the global economic context and could absorb
resources from sectors that are currently
downsizing. The table shows that companies in
both sectors operating in vulnerable Member States
were underinvesting in 2011, compared to their
peers in the core countries, after controlling for
their current operating performance and financial
strength. These results suggest that other factors,
beyond existing fundamentals, seem to limit
(8)

(9)

German SMEs' profitability shows more crosssectoral differences compared to other euro area
countries. However, this may be due to the database
coverage of German firms which differs from those
of other Member States. In terms of staff, the median
size of a German SME in the sample is around 60
employees, whereas the median size is below 20
employees in all other Member States. This could
explain, at least partially, the observed differences in
profitability.
IIF/Bain & Co (2013) points to the fact that SMEs'
capital needs have recently shifted from the financing
of long-term investment to the financing of working
capital.

current investment in the manufacturing sector,
possibly including credit supply tightness due to
financial fragmentation.
Given that the analysis takes into account firm
indebtedness (thereby controlling for "simple"
deleveraging pressures in highly indebted firms)
these results can only be explained by more
specific demand-related deleveraging pressures
(firms' general prudence with debt-financing due to
economic uncertainty). This would, however, not
be completely consistent with the above surveybased evidence. Besides, the table also shows that
the underinvestment in the construction sector does
not in all cases exceed the one in manufacturing.
Notably, the underinvestment of Spanish
construction firms compared to their core peers is
not statistically significant, possibly suggesting that
their current disinvestment is broadly in line with
their deteriorated fundamentals while the credit
supply constraint is less binding.

A different analytical approach to identify the
impact of financial market fragmentation on SMEs
was followed by IMF (2013). (10) It estimates the
impact of variables that proxy for financial
fragmentation on the lending rates charged to
SMEs, controlling for the business cycle, the
corporate credit risk and the monetary policy
stance. The variables that reflect financial
fragmentation measure sovereign risk and bank
health. (11) The difference between the actual
lending rate and the hypothetical one that would
arise if the variables of sovereign risk and bank
stress were zero, indicates by how much lending
rates would be lower if fragmentation did not exist.
The estimation was done for France, Italy and
Spain and revealed that lending rates in Italy and

Spain are between 100 bps. and 200 bps. above
their theoretically justified value.
Thus, the above analyses suggest that the
geographical location of the firm emerges as a
decisive factor in corporate lending and investment.
On the supply side, financial fragmentation appears
to play a role in constraining access to finance
and/or in driving up lending costs for SMEs in
vulnerable Member States. (12) However, financial
fragmentation should not be considered as fully
accountable for the wide differences in funding
costs of SMEs across euro area countries. As
shown, cross-country differences in the average
credit quality of the SMEs as measured, inter alia,
by profitability is also an important contributing
factor. Finally, deleveraging pressures may also
contribute, although there is no clear evidence of
higher SME indebtedness ratios in vulnerable
Member States relative to core countries. Indeed,
other demand-related factors could partially explain
lower lending volumes as SMEs in the vulnerable
countries are operating in a more uncertain
economic environment and may be more prudent
with respect to debt financing at the current
juncture.
Looking forward, the expected scenario of
improved economic and financial conditions in
vulnerable Member States should benefit SMEs in
both tradable on non-tradable sectors. SMEs
confidence should return on revived internal and
external demand while credit supply constraints
should also become less binding. However, SMEs
will most probably remain in a weaker position in
terms of funding compared with larger corporations
as their higher bank dependency means that
external funding will be reliant on full balancesheet repair in the banking sector. Targeted public
intervention aimed at improving funding for SMEs
seems therefore justified in this context.
Various policy initiatives are under way to address
financial fragmentation and the fragility of the

Commission, Product Market Review 2013

banking system. For example, the creation of the
single supervisory mechanism (SSM) aims to
address the reasons behind the fragmentation of
banking markets. More stringent capital
requirements for banks are expected to foster the
repair of banks' balance sheets, which should
ultimately support their capability to lend to
SMEs. (13) Various other policy initiatives aim at
reducing the bank dependency of the EU economy,
which may benefit SMEs indirectly as it increases
the amount of bank lending available to SMEs. (14)
Since these measures are likely to be effective only
in the medium term, policy makers have also
engaged in initiatives to facilitate SME borrowing
in the short term. The EU already provides
quantitatively relevant financing to SMEs,
including, inter alia, grants and other financial
instruments
such
as
loans,
guarantees,
securitisation
and
equity/venture
capital
products. (15) Under discussion is how EU
institutions can support the recovery of
securitisation markets for SME loans. This would
help banks to securitise parts of their SME loan
portfolios, thereby incentivising them to step up
lending to SMEs. Moreover, for the EU 2014-20
Multiannual Financial Framework, a proposal is
being evaluated for a new SME initiative, based on
financial instruments jointly funded by the EU
central budget and EU Structural and Investment
Funds allocations.

Some observers argue, however, that higher capital
requirements may temporarily reduce banks'
willingness to lend to SMEs, see OECD, Financing
SMEs and entrepreneurs 2012: An OECD
scoreboard, Paris 2012.
For an overview of policy initiatives, see IIF/Bain &
Co (2013) and IMF, Global Financial Stability
Report, October 2013.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the
European Investment Fund (EIF) are already
significantly contributing to financing SMEs by using
own resources and EU budget funds. Several Member
States operate similar SME schemes through national
business development banks. It has raised some
attention that KfW, the German business
development bank, joined forces with its Spanish
counterpart ICO to provide EUR 1.6 billion of
financing to Spanish SMEs.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

Box I.3: Impact of an upward adjustment in long-term benchmark interest rates on the
euro-area economy
Since early-May 2013, yields of long-term
sovereign bonds that are used as a benchmark for
risk-free interest rates in the US and the euro area
have moved up considerably. Particularly bond and
currency markets in some emerging economies
have been affected by the upward pressure on
yields in advanced capital markets. (1) While the
level of benchmark interest rates in advanced
economies is, in perspective, still close to their
historical trough, the increase has been relatively
steep and may imply a trend towards durably
higher long-term interest rates on global capital
markets (see Graph 1).

The 1994 bond market turbulences are widely
regarded as a precedent on how quickly interest
rate risk can spread across economies and impact
on economic activity. (2) At that time, yields on US
bonds moved up quickly after an extended period
of low interest rates. While the initial trigger for the
increase was a rate hike by the US Federal Reserve
following the end of a recession, yields increased
further on rising inflation and policy rate
expectations. Global bond holders realised
significant capital losses and their efforts to adjust
asset portfolios led to higher interest rates on
capital markets also outside the US. GDP growth in
several economies weakened significantly.
(1)

(2)

The term capital market is used here for the market
on which long-term debt securities are issued and
traded. Financial instruments with a maturity below
one year are traditionally seen as traded on money
markets. Sovereign bonds with a ten year maturity
are considered the "benchmark" for the capital
market.
See for example Box 1: Interest rate risk and the
Federal Reserve's tightening cycle: Comparison with
the events of 1994, in: ECB, Financial Stability
Report, June 2010, pp. 22-23.

In theory, there is no reason why domestic yields
should increase if yields abroad do. Exchange rate
adjustment may isolate domestic bond yields,
imposing the adjustment burden predominantly on
the export-oriented sectors. Moreover, interest rates
are no exogenous factor, but respond endogenously
to economic developments. This applies in
particular to policy rates which central banks set in
accordance with the projected economic and
monetary developments. Therewith in contrast,
market analysts sometimes ascribe bond market
developments to the expected stance of monetary
policy, which they consider a quasi-exogenous
force. Endogeneity is a decisive factor because the
extent to which changes in capital market rates
impact on GDP growth crucially depends on the
main driving force behind this increase, i.e.
whether higher interest rates are driven by higher
risk premia or by an anticipation of higher inflation
and/or stronger economic activity in the future.
Against this background, this box first examines
the potential drivers of the recent pick-up in yields,
in particular, whether it was due to a possible
normalisation in risk premia or a positive demand
shock stemming from improved growth and
inflation expectations. In a second step, model
simulations are used to gauge how a further rise in
yields would affect the euro-area economy
differently depending on the main driver behind the
rise.
Identifying the factors behind the increase in the
euro-area benchmark yield

The trend decline of risk-free benchmark yields
recorded in advanced economies since the onset of
the global financial crisis (see Graph 1) has been
underpinned by global investors' increased risk
aversion, i.e. their willingness to accept very low
yields on assets perceived as safe. Thus, the recent
reversal in long-term interest rates could be
explained by a normalisation in risk premia.
Beyond rising risk aversion, various other factors
contributed to lower capital market rates during the
financial crisis. Low growth limited the scope for
inflation pick-ups, which allowed central banks to
reduce policy rates. Liquidity on global markets
was ample, also because investment opportunities
were scarce in an environment of low growth and
high corporate credit risk. In the euro area, a rise in
sovereign risk in vulnerable Member States led to a
reallocation of savers' and institutional investors'

Box (continued)

portfolios towards "safe" benchmark bonds.
Besides, banks piled up bond holdings, inter alia, to
strengthen liquidity buffers, and on wholesale
funding markets the share of collateralised lending
increased. As a result of these factors, yields on
benchmark bonds decreased.

rising importance of corporations tapping the bond
market. In short, investors' portfolio adjustments
toward a higher share of higher-yielding riskier
assets at the expense of lower-yielding benchmark
bonds are one possible explanation for the increase
in benchmark yields.

However, at the beginning of May 2013, this
widespread trend in declining benchmark yields
seems to have halted. As the increase in yields was
particularly pronounced in the USA and upticks in
yields tended to occur at times of news about
developments in the US, the improving growth
outlook in the US, expectations about changes in
the pace of Federal Reserve's bond purchases and
its monetary policy stance, and more recently,
uncertainty about the fiscal situation are likely to be
the main drivers. The international transmission of
higher US yields varied considerably across
countries. Especially emerging economies with
high current account deficits or a growth model
becoming increasingly obsolete were the most
affected. Therewith in contrast, the rebound in
benchmark yields in the EU has taken place amid
significant adjustment efforts in some Member
States that have led to an improvement in their
external positions.

An alternative, or rather complementary,
hypothesis is that both US and euro-area yields are
driven by common fundamental factors. Since the
timing in the turnaround broadly corresponds to the
release of more optimistic euro-area business cycle
surveys and an improving outlook for growth in the
US, the rise in yields could also be due to
expectations of strengthening economic growth,
higher inflation and/or a tightening of the monetary
policy stance on both sides of the Atlantic. (4)

If market developments were entirely driven by
US-specific factors that had little impact on
economic conditions in the euro area, one could
expect to observe a rise in US bond yields and a
marked change in the USD/EUR exchange rate
while euro area bond yields would remain
unaffected. (3) Now, while the euro exchange rate
has appreciated somewhat, the high correlation of
US and euro-area benchmark bond yields is
striking. It may suggest that international bond
holders' risk perception changed irrespective of the
origin of the debt issuer and the macroeconomic
conditions the issuer is exposed to. Such a
transmission of higher US yields to rising risk
premia in European bond yields could be driven by
psychological
factors
("animal
spirits").
Alternatively, it could reflect that the appetite for
holding safe assets has globally declined, implying
a normalisation of benchmark yields from
previously low, or even negative, risk premia. It
would be consistent with the observed decline in
the yield spread of vulnerable euro-area Member
States' bonds over the German Bund and with the

While there was a notable turnaround in indications
from business surveys, actual growth predictions
for the euro area have hardly been revised upwards.
This holds for the present Commission forecast for
2014 as well as for the Consensus forecast, which
incorporates financial institutions' predictions. The
main scenario remains the one of a gradual
recovery of economic growth in the euro area. At
the same time, market prices of 10-year inflationindexed bonds and 10-year inflation swaps
(see Graph 2) do not suggest a sudden increase in
inflation expectations over the summer 2013 that
would motivate higher nominal bond yields in the
euro area. In fact, inflation expectations derived
from financial market prices have trended
marginally lower.

(4)
(3)

For example, rising inflation expectations in the US
could be neutral to fiscal positions and monetary
policy in the euro area and therewith find reflection
in higher US capital market rates, but not necessarily
in euro area bond yields.

These three variables broadly match a decomposition
applied in the literature of the bond yield into
monetary stance, inflation expectations, and term
premium. See Bernanke, B, Long-Term Interest
Rates,
Speech
at
the
Annual
Monetary/Macroeconomics
Conference
San
Francisco, 1 March 2013.
(Continued on the next page)

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

Box (continued)

The change in short-term forward rates recorded
over the summer suggests that markets may have
started to anticipate an increase in the ECB's policy
rates from their current low levels. (5) This
discounting of expected monetary tightening is
illustrated by an upward shift of the 3-month
Euribor futures curve (see Graph 3). Between early
May and October 2013, the price for the December
2017 futures contract moved up by 80 bps., which
may partly explain the observed increase in longterm bond yields. (6)

The increase in short-term forward rates, however,
does not seem to be aligned with the expected path
of macroeconomic indicators the ECB normally
takes into account for policy-rate decisions. As in
other advanced economies, the transition towards a
normalisation of monetary policy in the euro area
will depend on the return to sustained growth and
the re-emergence of inflation pressures. For the
time being, however, this point has not been
reached. Developments in inflation forecasts and
expectations suggest that price pressures remain
contained in the euro area. Indeed, one of the
objectives of the ECB's forward guidance is to
ensure that short-term forward rates are not overly
influenced by news that is unrelated to the
economic fundamentals of the euro area.
While the rise in yields thus does not appear to be
caused by expectations of strengthening economic

growth, higher inflation and/or a tightening of the
monetary policy stance, it could be attributed to an
increase in the term premium. (7) This premium
reflects the additional compensation that investors
require to hold a long-term asset rather than simply
rolling over a series of short-term investments.
However, it is ambiguous whether this change was
caused by a higher risk premium, respectively the
reversal of the low risk premium seen before, or
implied by macroeconomic fundamentals. Market
comments suggest that spill over effects are more
likely to stem from an increased US risk premium
than from an upward revision of macroeconomic
fundamentals. Particularly the discussion about the
gradual phasing out of the FED's bond purchases
may have induced some portfolio reallocation, as
the global demand for liquid AAA government
bonds decreased. It is also notable that the volatility
of bond yields increased, which led risk-averse
investors to reduce the share of bonds in their
portfolio. Both factors might have reduced the net
demand for German Bunds, thereby driving rates
upwards. The notion of an increase in the risk
premium inherent in the German Bund is, however,
not supported by the broadly constant spread
between the Bund and the swap rate. (8)
Quantifying the impact of higher long-term
interest rates on economic activity

In order to demonstrate that the GDP effects
depends on the underlying reasons of rising longterm interest rates the macro simulations (9)
consider two different scenarios. In the first
scenario, the increase in long-term interest rates is
driven by an exogenous increase in the risk
premium. This scenario mimics the market
perception of reduced safe-haven investment in
advanced economies and could be interpreted as
the normalisation of a previously extremely low
risk premium on safe assets, driven by exogenous
factors such as "animal spirits". It could also be
understood as a higher permanent risk premium
emerging from uncertainty about the US debt
ceiling and spilling over to sovereign risk in other
advanced economies. The second scenario builds
(7)

(5)

(6)

The upward shift in the Euribor forward rates may
also in part reflect expectations of a further decline in
excess liquidity owing to the continued repayments
of the 3-year LTROs.
This comparison can only be made for the period
covered by future contracts, i.e. the change in returns
implied by 3-months futures up to 2017 was
approximately half of the increase in the 4-year bond
yield. Note that the market for more distant future
contracts is not very liquid, which reduces the
reliability of the information derived from these
contracts.

See for example IMF, Global Financial Stability
Report, October 2013, chapter 1 and BIS, Markets
precipitate tightening, Quarterly Review, September
2013, pp. 1-11.
The price paid for swapping fixed and flexible
interest payment streams can be considered an
alternative measure for the safe interest rate. It has
been higher than the Bund and widened during past
crisis episodes, indicating the safe-haven character of
German sovereign bonds.
For the simulations, a four-region version (euro area,
other EU, US, rest of the world) of DG ECFIN's
QUEST III model was used.

on an improvement in the medium-term economic
outlook, and the increase in long-term yields is
derived from an expected standard monetary policy
reaction, i.e. future monetary tightening. The
scenarios abstract from particular financial factors
such as banks' exposure to interest rate risk or the
fact that market participants may already have
priced in rising interest rates.
The scenarios show the impact on GDP in the euro
area and EU28 of a 50 bps. increase in long-term
interest rates in advanced economies. Since the
objective is to analyse the impact of higher
government bond yields, it is assumed that the
German Bund yield increases by 50 bps. and the
spreads of other Member States' sovereign bonds to
the German Bund yield are kept constant. The two
scenarios yield very different GDP effects in the
short term (see Graph 4), indicating that the impact
of a rise in long-term interest rates on economic
activity indeed depends on the underlying forces.

consumption (in favour of higher savings) in
response to higher current and future yields. The
scenario also assumes an increase in yields in other
advanced economies, so that there is no offsetting
increase in external demand to soften the impact on
GDP in the EU.
In the second scenario, euro-area GDP growth
increases by 0.2 pps. in the first year and remains
unchanged in the second year. The scenario is
based on the expectation of an upswing in the
medium term. Households and firms anticipate the
increase in future income and partly frontload
consumption demand. The improvement in the
economic outlook goes hand in hand with a return
to a standard pre-crisis monetary policy that reacts
to inflation and the business cycle. Due to the
scenario's assumption of an improvement in the
economic outlook and a similar monetary
tightening across all regions, exchange rates remain
fairly unchanged, so that net exports contribute
little to GDP growth.
The above-described simulations used a structured
analytical framework to gauge the aggregate impact
on real GDP of a rise in interest rates and the
underlying macro-economic dynamics. The actual
outcome will also be influenced by factors that are
not part of the macro-simulation model used here,
for example financial structures, changes to risk
preferences and uncertainty.

In the first scenario, the increase in risk premia
tempers euro-area GDP growth by 0.2 pp. in the
first year and by another 0.1 pp. in the second year.
The adverse effect on GDP is driven by a fall in

The July 2013 euro-area bank lending survey
indicated a moderate tightening of lending
standards for non-financial corporations (NFCs), in
the second quarter. As regards households, the
degree of net tightening declined for housing loans
while recording a slight net easing for consumer
credits. For both NFCs and households, risk
assessment and macroeconomic uncertainty
remained the main factors curbing lending
policies. However, compared with the previous
survey round, banks reported a somewhat reduced
perception of risks and balance-sheet constraints.

Key for assessing the impact of higher capital
market interest rates on economic activity is the
determinant of the risk premium. If the risk
premium is primarily driven by "animal spirits" or
uncertainty, the effects on economic activity are
likely to be negative. If, on the other hand, the risk
premium only reflects the price for risk-taking that
fluctuates in line with economic variables such as
GDP growth or expected inflation, then there is
little reason to expect any detrimental net effects on
economic growth.

The assessment of loan demand remains weak
although signs of bottoming out are becoming
visible. For NFCs, the weakness of demand was
driven mainly by a substantial negative impact of
fixed investment on the financing needs of firms.
Looking forward to the third quarter of 2013, the
bank lending survey suggests a further moderation
of the credit standards tightening and a less
negative demand for both NFCs and households.
Credit standards and demand for NFCs are thus
expected to reach a neutral stance.

… and contributes to the outlook for a
"creditless" recovery.

Bank lending so far has remained weak and it has
not benefitted from the positive developments in
financial markets over the last couple of months.
Deep economic and financial crises are usually
followed by creditless recoveries, so that the
current delayed lending response could be rather
normal as a post post-crisis development. (11)
Creditless recoveries are also typically slow, and
this is reflected in the present forecast of subdued
domestic demand growth. The weakness of the
bank lending to the non-financial corporate sector
has been partly offset by lasting dynamics of the
market for debt securities, which remain consistent
with a transition towards market financing by
larger companies, whereas most small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain reliant
on banks and thus are in a very fragile position
(see box I.2).
All in all, the short-term outlook is for a
"creditless" recovery, notably in some euro-area
Member States, after a deep crisis episode.
However, survey-based signals seem currently

more encouraging than lending data, suggesting a
possible improvement in lending conditions in the
near future. As the economic recovery progresses,
the demand for loans could strengthen, which
would impact positively on lending to both NFCs
and households.

THE EU ECONOMY

After declining in first quarter, GDP in the second
quarter of 2013, expanded by 0.3% q-o-q, in both
the EU and the euro area. The recovery was
relatively broad-based across Member States,
including in some of the large Member States
(most notably in Germany and France), though
resulting to some extent from temporary factors.
Growth also rebounded in some more vulnerable
countries. In Portugal, GDP grew by a strong 1%
q-o-q (after -0.4% in the first quarter). In Spain,
the pace of contraction slowed down considerably
(-0.1% q-o-q), thanks to buoyant exports. The
GDP breakdown also shows further progress in
intra-euro-area rebalancing with a strong export
performance in some vulnerable Member States
and signs of strengthening domestic demand in
surplus countries. At the aggregate level, the
second quarter data shows a gradual return of
domestic demand, with consumption and
investment growth turning positive. Overall, these
are positive signs that an economic turnaround for

the EU and the euro area is at hand and that the
recession has now given way to a modest recovery.
A modest recovery …

Figures for the second quarter probably overestimate the underlying economic dynamics, with
a positive impact of weather-related factors. As
these temporary factors dissipate but lingering
effects from the crisis remain, and in a context of
subdued external demand, GDP growth in the EU
is likely to be moderate in the second half of 2013.
The latest high-frequency and survey indicators
point indeed to a gradual but modest revival in
economic activity in the third quarter. In
September, the euro-area PMI Composite Output
Index rose to 52.2, signalling the fastest rate of
growth in over two years. The Economic
Sentiment Indicator (ESI) also further increased in
September standing above its long-term average
for the first time since July 2011 in the EU (see
Graph I.9). Measures of economic and policy
uncertainty have decreased somewhat, reflecting
progress with the implementation of policy
measures at the EU and Member States level. In
contrast, industrial production has broadly
stagnated in the first two months of the third
quarter in the EU and the euro area, suggesting a
still fragile recovery in the manufacturing sector.
As a result, for 2013 as a whole, the GDP growth
forecast stands at 0% for the EU and -0.4% for the

euro area, largely reflecting the negative carryovers from the end of 2012. At the end of 2013,
the carry-over is expected to stand respectively at
0.5% in the EU and 0.4% in the euro area,
mirroring the improvement of the economic
situation in the course of this year.

… set to strengthen in 2014-15

Resting on the assumption that determined policy
implementation will provide the basis for further
improvements in confidence, abating financial
fragmentation, and strengthened economic
adjustment capacity of Member States, EU real
GDP growth is forecast to gradually strengthen in
the course of 2014. More precisely, after having

29

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

been a drag on growth for the last year and a half,
domestic demand is expected to turn into a key
motor of growth, but only very slowly, benefitting
from the gradual weakening of the impediments
stemming from the financial and economic crisis
(cf. section 1, see graph I.10). In fact, the
combination of deleveraging needs which are
notably still substantial in the private sector in a
number of Member States, cross-country
differences in financing conditions that are
narrowing very slowly and the under-utilisation of
resources related to the deep adjustments processes
in some countries, will prevent economic activity
from accelerating more markedly in the coming
year. However, domestic demand is expected to
show positive and moderate growth as consumer
and business confidence improve further and
uncertainty declines to levels compatible with
more sustained spending decisions. In addition, the
drag from fiscal consolidation is also expected to
be further reduced, and low inflation will provide
some relief for consumers and companies to spend
and invest more than in 2013. Overall, compared
to past recoveries, the current EU economic upturn
is set to be subdued, with real GDP growing by
1.4% in the EU and by 1.1% in the euro area in
2014.

Growth to become less export-dependent

Following two consecutive quarters of
contraction, exports of goods and services in both
the EU and euro area rebounded by around 2%
(q-o-q) in the second quarter of 2013. The CPB
trade data show that stronger demand from
advanced economies is behind this rebound, while
demand from emerging economies lost some
momentum. In the second half of the year, a
further export expansion is expected, in line with
the moderate growth of foreign demand for EU
products. Export order books from the Joint
Harmonised EU Programme of Business and
Consumer Surveys (or Commission's surveys)
have substantially improved in the third quarter,
signalling a relatively bright short-term outlook for
the EU external trade but less than in the spring
forecast. In fact, due to the downward revision in
global demand in line with the deceleration in the
emerging markets and due to the continued
appreciation of the euro exchange rate, export
growth has been revised downward compared to
the spring forecast (see box I.1). For 2013 as a
whole, exports are set to grow by 1.5% in the EU
and by 1.3% in the euro area. Nevertheless,
exports will remain the key growth driver in 2013
in line with a still depressed domestic demand.

EU exports are projected to gain more momentum
in 2014 and 2015, reflecting the gradual
strengthening of external demand, more
specifically the upturn in the advanced economies
and some continuous competitiveness gains in the
vulnerable Member States. Export growth is thus
expected at around 4% in the EU and the euro area
in 2014, before becoming more robust and
reaching 5 ½% in 2015 (see Graph I.11).

Further out, an acceleration of GDP growth is
expected as the headwinds weighing on growth are
expected to further abate. Gradually improving
labour market conditions, more favourable
financing conditions, fading deleveraging needs
and lower uncertainty are expected to further
strengthen the recovery. The impact of
implemented structural reforms is expected to start
showing more firmly in 2015, reinforcing these
positive developments. Overall, real GDP is
projected to grow by 1.9% in the EU and by 1.7%
in the euro area in 2015, under the usual no-policychange assumption.

second quarter of 2013, imports increased by 1½%
in the EU and the euro area. With increasing
growth momentum and stronger domestic demand,
import volumes are set to grow by about 4% in
2014 in the EU and the euro area and to further
accelerate to 5 ½% in 2015.
Overall, net exports are expected to continue
contributing positively to GDP growth over the
period 2013-15. The support of net foreign demand
to overall EU GDP growth is, however, set to
decline in favour of domestic demand over the
forecast horizon, but still with some noticeable
differences between the euro-area "surplus" and
"former deficit" countries (see Graph I.12).

investment could be lacking steam in the absence
of a stronger impulse from global trade. For the
third quarter of 2013, the available indicators
support the view of a continued but moderate
recovery of investment. The Commission's
business survey in the industry shows confidence
lifting above its long-term average in both the EU
and the euro area in September. Moreover,
capacity utilisation increased in the third quarter of
2013, though remaining at low levels (see
Graph I.13). However, in the short term, overall
uncertainty and ongoing deleveraging as well as
still adverse financing conditions for the nonfinancial corporate sector, notably in some
Member States will continue to dampen
investment spending. Construction investment is
likely to remain weak in the remainder of the year,
as suggested by survey data. Overall for 2013,
gross fixed capital formation is expected to still
decline, mainly reflecting carry-over effects from
the start of the year.

Investment finally unlocked...

After a continuous decline during two years, gross
fixed capital formation finally increased in the
second quarter of 2013, by 0.2% q-o-q in the EU
and the euro area. The breakdown of investment
shows a rebound of machinery and equipment
investment, while construction investment
continued to decline in the EU and stabilised in the
euro area, driven by a strong contraction in nonresidential investment. Besides, changes in
inventories made a limited negative contribution to
growth compared to the latest two years,
suggesting that the scope for destocking is at the
current juncture more limited. (12)
For the second half of the year, some modest
growth in investment is expected as the typical
sequence of external demand kick-starting
(12)

This assessment is in line with the latest Commission's
business surveys, which show that companies' stocks in the
manufacturing and retail sector are considered to be below
their long-term average.

… on the back of a rebound in equipment
investment

Going forward, gross fixed capital formation is
expected to rebound as from 2014, mainly
supported by equipment investment. It should
benefit from higher domestic and external demand,
strengthening business confidence and lower
uncertainty, the need to gradually replace an
ageing capital stock after a marked adjustment
phase, steadily easing financing conditions and
increasing corporate profits as activity recovers.
The pick-up in equipment investment in 2014 is,
however, expected to be subdued compared to past
recoveries as downside factors will continue being
at play. These include the need for further
corporate balance sheet restructuring and still not
normalised financing conditions in some Member

31

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

States. Construction investment is set to resume
growing but will remain weak on the back of
continuous corrections in some euro-area housing
markets. A contraction will even persist in the
countries facing the strongest housing corrections
(notably in Spain). Overall, in 2014, gross fixed
capital formation is set to increase by 2.5% in the
EU and by 1.9% in the euro area.
In 2015, investment growth is expected to
accelerate further to respectively 4% in the EU and
3.6% in the euro area as the recovery gains
strength and in a context of more favourable
financial conditions in vulnerable Member States.
Besides, investment decisions should benefit from
the impact on growth prospects of structural
reforms undertaken during the crisis years.
Consumption set to stabilise before growing
moderately

Private consumption increased by 0.2% and 0.1%
respectively in the EU and the euro area in the
second quarter of 2013, showing positive growth
for the first time since autumn 2011. While
sectoral data was not available at the cut-off
date, (13) this development might mirror a
slowdown in the pace of decline in households'
real disposable income probably on the back of
higher wages, low inflation and a more moderate
fiscal drag. The improvement of consumer
confidence in the second quarter might also have
had a positive impact on the saving rate.
In the second half of 2013, private consumption is
expected to grow slightly, in line with weak real
disposable income growth and high precautionary
savings. Short-term indicators point indeed
towards some growth in private consumption.
Retail sales in the EU in July and August stood
½% above the level recorded in the second quarter
of 2013. As for soft data, the Commission's retail
trade and consumer confidence indicators
improved substantially during the third quarter,
standing now above their long-term averages (see
Graph I.14); this bodes well for the end of the year.
Overall despite some improvements in the second
half of the year, annual private consumption is
forecast to fall by 0.1% in the EU and by 0.7% in
the euro area in 2013.

Private consumption (lhs)
Private consumption, forecast (annual data, lhs)
Consumer confidence (rhs)

Private consumption is expected to gain some
limited momentum in 2014 as households’ real
disposable income growth turns positive. On the
back of a stabilisation in labour market conditions,
nominal wage growth is expected to pick up,
which together with low consumer-price inflation
will support real disposable income. Moreover, the
slower pace of fiscal consolidation and higher
consumer confidence are also expected to support
household spending. However, the need for
deleveraging should continue weighing on private
consumption.
Overall
in
2014,
private
consumption is expected to grow moderately by
0.9% in the EU and 0.6% in the euro area. Looking
further ahead, private consumption is expected to
rebound by 1.5% in the EU and by 1.3% in the
euro area in 2015 as labour market conditions start
improving more visibly and the recovery gains
strength.
Public consumption recovering as the pace of
fiscal tightening slows down

Government consumption increased in the second
quarter of 2013, after stalling in the previous
quarter. As significant consolidation needs subsist
in some Member States, aggregate public
consumption is, however, set to fall in the short
term in both the EU and the euro area. For 2013 as
a whole, government consumption is projected to
remain broadly constant in both the EU and the
euro area. Further ahead, with weaker
consolidation needs, public consumption is
expected to increase modestly in 2014 and 2015 at
a rate well below GDP growth. Declines in 2014
and 2015 are still expected in Ireland, Greece,
Spain, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovenia. The forecast
for 2015 is based on the no-policy-change
assumption, according to which consolidation
measures are only factored in if they have been

Current-account
surplus
continues
strengthening in the euro area in 2013…

After years of having a roughly balanced external
position, the current-account balance of both the
EU and the euro area has now shifted into a
moderate surplus (in adjusted terms) and is
forecast to be close to 1½% and 2½% of GDP ,
respectively in 2013. Moreover, it is expected to
stay broadly at this level in 2014 and 2015 in the
EU while expanding to above 2½% in the euro
area.

… as structural adjustment in vulnerable
countries is making progress

The process of external and internal adjustment in
vulnerable Member States continues progressing,
as unsustainable domestic demand, notably from
residential investment, has been reduced and
exports have picked up. Owing to wage
moderation and rising labour productivity, unit
labour costs in programme countries and other
vulnerable Member States are set to go on
decreasing over the forecast horizon, reversing the
pre-crisis trend of eroding price competitiveness.
This recent improvement allowed for a solid
export performance in vulnerable economies as
firms successfully turned to export markets. As a
consequence, the current-account balance of all
vulnerable countries but Cyprus and Greece is
expected to turn positive in 2013 and increase over
the forecast horizon, against the background of
solid export performance.

sustained improvements in the current-account
balances of vulnerable countries might be needed
to reduce the still high degree of external
indebtedness to more sustainable levels.

Expected change avg. 2013-15 versus 2012

Most of the strengthening in the euro-area current
account is the result of significant adjustment in
the vulnerable countries, which previously
recorded high deficits (see Graph I.15). External
rebalancing in vulnerable euro-area Member States
is supported by gains in price competiveness due
to lower unit labour costs as well as by the
contraction of domestic demand. Going forward,
the expected recovery in domestic demand is set to
slow down the growth of net exports. However,

Costs and prices are adjusting, with deeper
reductions in wages in non-tradables, and more
dynamic prices in tradables, which is favourable
from the rebalancing point of view. (14) However,
the progress in reallocating resources towards the
production of tradables has been limited so far in
most vulnerable countries. As the reallocation of
labour to more productive activities has proven
difficult, unemployment has often risen sharply.

Area, 2012 (3), pages 19-25.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

After a long period of deterioration of labour
market conditions …

Labour market conditions have deteriorated well
into 2013, on the back of the weakness in
economic activity and labour-market adjustments
in several Member States. The number of
employed persons fell in both the EU and the euro
area during the past two years. In the second
quarter of 2013, employment was 0.7% and 1.4%
lower than two years before, when for the last time
positive quarter-on-quarter growth rates had been
registered.
Unemployment
rates
reached
unprecedented levels for both the EU and for the
euro area, respectively to 11.0% and 12.1%. A
special feature of this development has been the
sharp rise in unemployment among young people
to 23.5% (as a percentage of the labour force
15-24) in the EU and 23.9% in the euro area in the
second quarter of 2013. At the same time, the
divergence in the labour market performance
across Member States has reached an
unprecedented magnitude.
… signs of stabilisation emerge …

The latest labour market data point to some
stabilisation. In the EU and the euro area,
unemployment rates have come to a standstill
respectively since May and July at 10.9% and
12%, levels confirmed up to August. In the second
quarter, employment stagnated in the EU and only
marginally declined in the euro area (-0.1% q-o-q).
Many forward-looking labour market indicators
have also stopped deteriorating in recent months.
According to Commission's surveys, employment
expectations in the EU and euro-area industry have
steadily increased for five months up to September
and exceed the long-term average, whereas
expectations in the services sector have started
improving in the summer, but remain low (see
Graph I.16). Consumers' unemployment fears have
also steadily declined from the peaks observed in
late 2012. The euro-area PMI employment index
also shows some improvement recently, timidly
pointing to the 50 threshold in all sectors but
construction.
... but only limited improvements are in sight for
2014 and 2015 ...

Labour market developments typically lag behind
economic activity, and employment therefore
cannot be expected to start growing markedly in

34

the very near term. But the outlook for a continued
economic expansion over the forecast horizon
constitutes the foundations for a more positive
labour market development further out.

Employment is expected to only slightly decline in
the euro area and remaining almost stable in the
EU in the second half of 2013, after falling
continuously for the last two years. The subdued
recovery of economic activity is expected to come
along with only a minor positive impact on
employment in 2014 (¼%) but more visible ones
in 2015 (¾%). The sluggishness of growth in
private sector employment is driven by two
factors: (i) the impact of working-hours adjustment
that employers usually use before taking
recruitment decisions, in particular as hours per
employee are well below their pre-crisis level; and
(ii) a still high level of uncertainty. Besides, the
current specific problems of small and mediumsized businesses to get funding for their activities,
could also negatively impact their hiring decisions,
while in past recoveries, those firms took a leading
role in employment creation.
The labour force in the EU and the euro area is
forecast to grow more moderately this year and
next, than in 2012. The underlying structural
increase of the labour force is shaped by
demographic factors and a continuous rising
participation of the elderly. In the short-run , the
"added worker effect" (resulting from the need of
an additional income for households hit by the
crisis) which characterised the response of
participation in recent years is expected to be
partly offset by stronger discouragement effects
and falling participation of the young, in particular
in the countries with high long-term
unemployment rates.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Labour productivity (output per person employed)
is usually growing strongly during a recovery (15)
but this time the pace and patterns of the expected
recovery are insufficient to generate a strong
cyclical productivity pick-up over the forecast
horizon. Besides the weakness of the on-going
recovery, this could suggest that on average the
scope for creating new jobs remains limited or that
recruitment is skewed to activities with low

... as the unemployment rate will remain
persistently high

-0.2

The unemployment rate in the EU (euro area) is
expected to rise further during the course of 20l3
and to reach 11.0% (12.2%) on average over 2013.
The unemployment rate is then expected to remain
unchanged in 2014, before declining only
modestly to 10.7% (11.8%) in 2015, thus
remaining at very high levels (see Graph I.17). As
a result, the unemployment rate during the
forthcoming recovery years will be much higher
than in the years 2004-08 (by 2½ pp. in the EU and
3½ pp. in the euro area). Structural unemployment
is likely to have risen in the past years, reflecting
low productivity gains, the impact of long-term
unemployment on skills, growing labour-market
mismatches due to sectoral adjustment processes more specifically for low-skilled workers
displaced from declining sectors and industries and, more generally, a decline in production
capacity. This is mirrored by the rise in the
NAWRU, which according to the Commission
estimates has increased substantially since 2008.
However, variations in the NAWRU might also
partly reflect cyclical factors. (16)

Inflation declines faster than expected…

Consumer-price inflation continued to decline in
the course of 2013, reaching 1.5% in the EU and
1.3% in the euro area in the third quarter, thanks to
easing energy inflation and despite a temporarily
higher-than-usual unprocessed food inflation. The
drop in energy-price inflation reflected in turn the
decline in oil prices and the appreciation of the
euro over the past year, as well as downward base

…as weak domestic demand finally inhibits
core inflation as well

Core inflation, i.e. HICP inflation excluding
energy and unprocessed food, has eased since last
spring, after remaining stable at an elevated level
during the crisis. Labour market rigidities, but also
the pass-through of increases in indirect taxes and
administrative prices in several Member States (17)
as well as well-anchored inflation expectations
have been identified as drivers of the persistence in
core inflation. (18) Only since the spring 2013, the
adjustment gained some speed and in the third
quarter of 2013, core inflation seems more in line
with economic activity, at 1.4% in the EU and
1.3% in the euro area. The broad stabilisation of
core inflation at around 1½% in 2014-15
(Graph I.18) is consistent with the amount of slack
in the economy and the expected pace of recovery.
(17)

(18)

The theoretical impact of tax increases on headline
inflation was 0.4 pp. in 2012. In the first half of 2013, the
impact was of a similar magnitude due to substantial tax
hikes introduced late-2012 in Spain and the Netherlands.

Recent research even stresses that pro-cyclicality of
movements in output and productivity has increased since
the 2007, see e.g. M. C. Daly et al., Okun's macroscope:

Limited external price pressures, …

External price pressures eased substantially in the
first half of 2013 thanks to the appreciation of the
euro and the deceleration in commodity prices,
Import prices measured by the deflator of imports
of goods are projected to ease sharply in 2013
given the expected modest recovery and the
exchange rate and commodity prices assumptions.
In 2014-15, with the expected improvement in
global economic activity, import-price inflation is
set to accelerate somewhat, though remaining
subdued compared to historical developments.
… subdued wage growth …

Reflecting the overall weakness in economic
activity, wage pressures continued to be subdued
in the first half of 2013. In the euro area, the
growth in compensation per employee slowed
down slightly from 2.0% in 2012 to 1.5%, in the
second quarter of 2013. On the back of a slight
pick-up in productivity in the second quarter, unitlabour-cost growth decelerated to 1.0%, from 1.9%
in 2012. Looking ahead, since the growth in
compensation per employee is set to somewhat
outpace the growth in labour productivity, unit
labour costs are set to grow at a steady pace of
around 1% per year in the euro area and in the EU
over the forecast horizon, thus putting only a
limited upward pressure on inflation.
… and very low producer-price inflation …

The weakness in economic activity and the decline
in energy-price inflation have kept the pipeline
pressures in check in the first half of 2013. In
August, annual industrial producer price inflation
(excluding construction) even turned negative,
falling to -¼% in the EU and -¾% in the euro area
the lowest rates since early 2010. Similarly, the

… suggest subdued inflation going forward

Following the more benign developments since the
spring forecast, the average annual HICP inflation
in 2013 has been revised down to 1.7% in the EU
and 1.5% in the euro area. Given that the passthrough from past increases in oil prices and hikes
in taxation in many Member States is fading away
and given the assumptions for commodity prices
and exchange rates, inflation is set to remain rather
stable until the end of the year.
Looking ahead into 2014-15, the projected
subdued recovery is not likely to induce substantial
inflationary pressures, given the amount of slack in
the economy and well-anchored inflation
expectations. Nevertheless, considering the
outlook for a differentiated pace of recovery,
cyclical position and the impact of implemented or
planned fiscal consolidation measures across
Member States, inflation dispersion in the EU is
set to slightly increase within the forecast horizon.
Under the no-policy-change assumption, HICP
inflation in 2014-15 is set to stabilise at 1.6% in
the EU and at around 1.5% in the euro area.
General government balances continue to
improve amid a subdued economic outlook

Fiscal consolidation is projected to continue over
the forecast horizon in both the EU and the euro
area. After impressive fiscal consolidation
achieved over the past three years, its pace is
expected to decelerate. This pattern of
consolidation is consistent with a gradual

The structural budget balance is the cyclically-adjusted budget balance net of one-off and other temporary measures estimated
by the European Commission

correction of excessive deficits (19) and is the result
of front-loaded fiscal adjustment, notably in the
euro area.
Improvements in nominal government balances
stem mainly from continuous underlying fiscal
effort, as the economic activity is expected to
remain weak this year. As a result of the
significant fiscal consolidation measures already
implemented by several Member States or the
measures planned for the rest of this year, the
nominal deficit-to-GDP ratio in 2013 is forecast to
improve by 0.6 pp. in the EU and by 0.4 pp. in the
euro area, reaching 3.5% and 3.1% of GDP
respectively.
Assuming a gradual economic recovery in the
course of 2014 and given the sizeable deficitreducing measures included by Member States in
their draft budgets for 2014, headline deficits are
set to shrink further next year. More specifically,
the fiscal deficit is expected to fall below the 3%
threshold in both areas, notably to 2.7% of GDP in
the EU and to 2.5% of GDP in the euro area.
In line with the projected moderate pick-up in
economic activity and based on the usual nopolicy-change assumption, the deficit-to-GDP ratio
is set to decrease slightly further in 2015, in the
EU as well as in the euro area. The projected
improvement in nominal budget balances is likely
to be broad-based across Member States over the
forecast period.

The structural budget deficit, i.e. the general
government deficit corrected for cyclical factors,
one-offs and other temporary measures, is forecast
to decline significantly in 2013 by more than ½%
of GDP in both areas, on the back of consolidation
programmes implemented in several Member
States. According to the currently available 2014
draft budgets, this improvement is set to continue
in 2014 in both areas, but at a slower pace (see
Graph I.20). This is partially explained by the fact
that some major Member States have already
achieved their respective Medium Term Objectives
(MTOs) for their budgetary balances. In 2015,
under the usual no-policy-change assumption, the
structural deficits are expected to deteriorate
slightly in both areas.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

Fiscal consolidation moving from revenue
increases to expenditure-based

the firmer pick-up in economic activity is likely to
reduce cyclical expenditure items. Besides in 2014,
expenditure cuts are expected to be the main driver
of the consolidation, reinforcing this trend.
Expenditure cuts will notably take the form of
discretionary fiscal measures involving mainly
wages and salaries, as well as intermediate
consumption and, to a lesser extent, public
investment.

In both the EU and the euro area, the fiscal
adjustment in 2013 is likely to be mainly driven by
increases in general government revenues as it was
the case in the last two years. Tax receipts on
income and wealth are notably projected to be the
main driver of the increase in public revenues. As
a result, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is set to reach a
peak in 2013 in the euro area, and in 2014 in the
EU of respectively 46.7% and 45.8%. Further
ahead given that temporary tax-increasing
measures phase out and a number of Member
States intend to introduce limited tax cuts, the
revenue-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline. More
precisely, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is set to
decline in the EU and in the euro area in 2015 (see
Graph I.21).

Due to the modest recovery, debt ratios are
expected to increase until 2014

Despite the large deficit-reducing measures
undertaken by a large majority of Member States,
the debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase in
2013 and 2014, albeit at a slower pace compared to
previous years, reaching a peak of 90.2% in the
EU and of 95.9% in the euro area in 2014 (see
table I.6). Compared to the spring 2013 forecast,
public debt has been revised slightly downwards,
notably in 2014 for both areas (20). The increase of
the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2013 for the euro area is
mainly due to the strong contribution of the
interest expenditure, and the stock-flow
adjustment. In 2014 only, interest expenditure and
the stock-flow adjustment are expected to
contribute much less to the public debt increase
given a higher primary surplus and more robust
growth prospects. In 2015, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio is forecast to slightly decrease in both areas
for the first time since 2007.

The downward of revision of the EU debt-to GDP ratio in
2014 can be almost entirely explained by the impact of the
pension reform in Poland, which is estimated to have a
permanent impact on the EU debt ratio of around 0.3 pp.
Theoretically, the impact on EU28 government net lending
in 2014 of the Polish pension reform is the same of that
related to public debt, i.e. around 0.3 pp. of GDP.

RISKS

Irrespective of the mostly positive news coming
from the latest economic data, uncertainty over
economic, political and financial developments
remains high, and downside risks to economic
activity continue to prevail (see Graph I.22). While
tail risks related to the sovereign-debt crisis have
all but vanished, the main domestic risk remains
financial stress and the re-activation of negative
feedback loops stemming from policy slippage.
Risks in the external environment have risen in
importance.
The materialisation of the central scenario depends
on further improvement in business and consumer
confidence as well as a further decrease of
financial fragmentation. The entering into force of
the Single Supervisory Mechanism constitutes a
major step forward towards the Banking Union.
Yet, some challenges weighing on financial
markets and on the banking sector have not been
resolved yet. The forecast assumption of reduced
uncertainty and improved funding conditions is
based on progress with the banking union
including proper backstops. Renewed financial
market stress and loss of confidence cannot be
excluded if reform fatigue gets the upper hand at
Member State or European level.

vulnerable sovereigns with the risk of reactivating
negative feedback loops. On the other hand, search
for yield could benefit the vulnerable countries.
Slower than anticipated global growth, originating
from weaknesses in emerging market economies
cannot be excluded. Potential growth in EMEs
might be lower than previously expected as past
growth rates might have been inflated by stimulus
programmes and rapid credit growth. Aside from
current geopolitical risks, a renewed bout of
financial turbulence and capital flow volatility
would pose problems for many emerging markets.
This could be aggravated by a further rise in global
bond yields due to market overreaction to moves
by the Federal Reserve or by a repeated political
stand-off on the US federal budget. More
specifically on the US, the debt ceiling will need to
be raised again early 2014; failure to do so swiftly
could seriously damage the global economy, also
via increased uncertainty and financial headwinds.
More broadly, inability to deliver reforms
necessary to raise the underlying growth rate has
emerged as a major risk in some EMEs (e.g. India,
Brazil and Russia). While a sharp downturn in
China appears unlikely in the short term, it remains
a concern over the forecast horizon.
The strength of recoveries often surprises. Upside
risks are related to positive feedback loops
between confidence, growth (in particular of
investment) and the ability of the banking sector to
extend loans. Benign developments on financial
markets might support confidence more strongly
than envisaged in the baseline. More structural
reforms than reflected in this forecast under the nopolicy-change assumption may be adopted, and the
reforms already implemented in vulnerable
Member States could result in early positive
effects and an accelerated adjustment process with
positive impact on growth.

Over the summer, EU financial markets have been
under-proportionally affected by the volatility
related to the perspective of tapering of
quantitative easing by the US Fed, as market
attention shifted from vulnerable euro-area
Member States to emerging markets. However,
uncertainty in global financial markets has
increased. On the one hand, increased risk aversion
by international investors could again drive up
spreads between Bunds and bonds issued by

Risks to the inflation outlook appear broadly
balanced over the forecast horizon. On the upside,
unanticipated further increases in indirect taxes
and administrative prices, as well as oil and
commodities prices hikes due to geopolitical
tensions could put additional pressure on prices.
On the downside, weaker-than-expected economic
activity in the EU and the global economy,
possibly coupled with declining nominal rigidities
induced by product and labour markets reforms
might reduce price pressures even further. Besides,
the recent decrease in core inflation in the presence
of large output gaps could lead to a downward
adjustment of short-term inflation expectations.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013

Box I.4: Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
22 October. The forecast incorporates validated
public finance data as published in Eurostat's News
Release 152/2013 of 21 October 2013.
External assumptions

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 7 and 18 October) were used for
exchange and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption as regards exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.33
in 2013 and 1.36 both in 2014 and 2015. The
average JPY/EUR rates are 128.75 in 2013 and
132.75 in 2014 and 2015.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based.
Short-term interest rates for the euro area are
derived from futures contracts. Long-term interest
rates for the euro area, as well as short- and
long-term interest rates for other Member States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro-area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are assumed to be 0.2% on average in
2013, 0.4% in 2014 and 0.7% in 2015 in the euro
area. Long-term euro-area interest rates are
assumed to be 1.6% on average in 2013, 2.1% in
2014 and 2.4% in 2015.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as
possible, based on market conditions. According to
futures markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to
be on average 108.8 USD/bbl in 2013, 105.8
USD/bbl in 2014 and 99.7 USD/bbl in 2015. This
would correspond to an oil price of 82.0 EUR/bbl
in 2013, 78.0 EUR/bbl and 73.4 EUR/bbl in 2015.

Budgetary data

Data up to 2012 are based on data notified by
Member States to the European Commission on
1 October and validated by Eurostat on 21 October
2013.
Eurostat has expressed its reservation on the quality
of the data reported by Austria, due to uncertainties
on the statistical impact of the conclusions of the
Federal Audit Office's report on the Land Salzburg,
published on 9 October 2013. The report revealed
deficiencies with regard to financial management
and to completeness of the public accounts of the
Land Salzburg. The statistical implications of the
audit for EDP data are being investigated by
Statistics Austria in collaboration with Eurostat, in
order to clarify the precise impacts on 2012 and
also on preceding years. It is possible that this will
lead to an upward revision of government debt of
up to half a percent of GDP, with more minor
revisions to the government deficit, based on the
information available at the time of the validation.
For the forecast, measures in support of financial
stability have been recorded in line with the
Eurostat Decision of 15 July 2009.(1) Unless
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned,
capital injections known in sufficient detail have
been included in the forecast as financial
transactions, i.e. increasing the debt, but not the
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and
deposits are not included as government
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have
been called on at the time the forecast was
finalised. Note, however, that loans granted to
banks by the government, or by other entities
classified in the government sector, usually add to
government debt.
For 2014, budgets adopted or presented to national
parliaments and all other measures known in
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. In
particular, all the information included in the Draft
Budgetary Plans submitted by 15 October is
reflected in this forecast. For 2015, the 'no-policychange' assumption used in the forecasts implies
the extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends
and the inclusion of measures that are known in
sufficient detail.

Box (continued)

The general government balances that are relevant
for the Excessive Deficit Procedure may be slightly
different from those published in the national
accounts. The difference concerns settlements
under swaps and forward rate agreements (FRA).
According to ESA95 (amended by regulation No.
2558/2001), swap- and FRA-related flows are
financial transactions and therefore excluded from
the calculation of the government balance.
However, for the purposes of the excessive deficit
procedure, such flows are recorded as net interest
expenditure. European aggregates for general
government debt in the forecast years 2013-15 are
published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not
corrected for intergovernmental loans). To ensure
consistency in the time series, historical data are
also published on the same basis. For 2012, this
implies a debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area which
is 2.1 pp. (1.5 pp. in the EU) higher than the
consolidated general government debt ratio
published by Eurostat in its news release 152/2013
of 21 October 2013. General government debt
projections for individual Member States in
2013-15 include the impact of guarantees to the

EFSF,(2) bilateral loans to other Member States, and
the participation in the capital of the ESM as
planned on the cut-off date of the forecast (subject
to approval).
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output
gaps

The number of working days may differ from one
year to another. The Commission's annual GDP
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited over the
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and
unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally (by
up to ±0.1 pp.). The calculation of potential growth
and the output gap does not adjust for working
days. Since the working-day effect is considered as
temporary, it should not affect the cyclicallyadjusted balances.

Prospects by individual economy

Member States

1. BELGIUM
Shaking off stagnation
Prudent recovery is underway

Following a flat activity rate in the first three
months of 2013, real GDP expanded by 0.2% in
the second quarter. This was the strongest growth
rate in two years and broke a pattern of stagnating
economic activity. The upturn was driven both by
net exports and household consumption. Overall
growth in 2013 is projected to reach 0.1% of GDP
on the assumption of a continued gradual recovery
during the second half of the year. While activity is
expected to pick up over the forecast horizon on
the back of stronger domestic demand, at 1.1% in
2014 and 1.4% in 2015, no acceleration towards
past growth rates is projected. Nurturing this
medium-term growth potential would require a
stronger impetus to supply-side reforms. Credit
conditions are not expected to tighten as compared
to the current situation. Other short-term risks to
the forecast scenario are primarily external in
nature and balanced.
Graph II.1.1:Belgium - Real GDP growth and contributions

Given its regional trade orientation, the Belgian
economy is assumed to be only indirectly affected
by the recent slowdown of global trade. Mild
export growth combined with negative import
growth results in net trade contributing 0.5 pp. to
overall growth in 2013. Imports are set to catch up
with domestic demand and exports in coming
years, causing the goods deficit to widen again.

Confidence indices of industry, services and
consumers as well as overall economic sentiment
have been improving since spring, reaching their
highest level in almost two years and moving close
to their long-term averages. This soft indicator
trend is forecast to foreshadow actual performance
in upcoming quarters, also supported by the recent
pick-up in activity in trading partner countries.
Weak labour market dynamics and continuing
wage moderation dampen real disposable income
growth, hampering the short-term outlook for
private consumption. Household spending is
expected to accelerate steadily in the course of
2014, in parallel with a bottoming-out on the
labour market. More solid income growth is
forecast to underpin consumer spending in 2015.

46

Reflecting partly an important carry-over from
2012, capital formation is forecast to fall by 2.6%
in 2013 with both construction and equipment
investment subsiding for a second year in a row.
Construction is at odds with the general trend of
more robust soft indicators with confidence at its
weakest level in over 15 years. Activity in the
sector is expected to contract again in 2013 and
feature only modest growth in 2014. This reflects a
correction in public investment due to the electoral
cycle at local level as well as a contraction in
housing investment for the third consecutive year.

As companies have been moving from labour
hoarding to labour shedding, job losses have been
larger than in 2009-10 with recent layoffs more
concentrated in smaller companies. Also the public
sector (which in 2009-10 partly offset private
sector job losses) has been shrinking its payroll
and is expected to continue to do so in upcoming
years. The unemployment rate is projected to
average 8.6% in 2013 and rise further to 8.7% in
2014 as job creation is outpaced by the growth in
the labour force. The turnaround in the labour
market towards 2015 is thus anticipated to be still
modest, raising the spectre of a jobless recovery.
Meanwhile, inflation has further abated to a level
close to that in neighbouring countries. With low
price pressures delaying wage indexation for most
workers and real wages frozen, nominal wage
growth is set to be confined. This is translated into
unit labour costs advancing more slowly than in
the past, also because of a pick-up in productivity.
Turning point for public finances

The general government deficit is projected to
reach 2.8% of GDP in 2013, 0.1 pp. lower than
expected in the spring forecast. The improvement
results from 0.2% of GDP of new consolidation

Member States, Belgium

measures announced at the end of June, which are
however, partly offset by a downward revision in
the local government accounts.
Total government revenue is expected to rise from
51.0% of GDP in 2012 to 51.2% in 2013. Indirect
tax revenues are expected to increase only
modestly, on the back of low inflation, sluggish
consumption growth and a loss of one-off revenues
from the nuclear energy sector which boosted the
2012 revenues. Direct tax revenues are more
dynamic, due to modifications in the corporate tax
regime and an increase in financial income
taxation.
Total expenditure is expected to drop marginally,
from 54.2% of GDP in 2012 (excluding the 0.8%
of GDP impact from the recapitalisation of Dexia)
to 54.1% of GDP in 2013, due to a fall in interest
expenditure and lower public investment linked to
the electoral cycle at local level. The structural
balance is expected to improve by around ¾% of
GDP in 2013, while one-off factors (such as a
fiscal amnesty and the sale of telecom licences)
amount to around 0.4% of GDP.

In 2014, the deficit is expected to decline further to
2.6% of GDP. The improving economic environment is projected to boost tax revenues, while new
consolidation measures of around 0.5% of GDP
more than offset one-off factors that impacted
2013. In addition, low inflation in 2013 and 2014
will contribute to curbing the rise in government
expenditure. The structural balance is expected to
improve by ½% of GDP in 2014.
Under the no-policy-change assumption, the deficit
is expected to broadly stabilise in 2015, despite the
projected strengthening of economic growth. The
structural balance is forecast to deteriorate slightly
due to the increasing trend in social expenditure.
General government debt is projected to increase
from 99.8% of GDP in 2012 to 100.4% in 2013.
The positive impact of the reimbursement of a loan
by KBC (0.5% of GDP) and the sale of Royal Park
Investments (0.2% of GDP) is almost entirely
offset by other stock-flow adjustments, such as the
contribution to the EFSF/ESM. The debt-to-GDP
ratio is forecast to rise further in 2014, mostly due
to stock-flow adjustments, and to start declining in
2015.

2. BULGARIA
Muted economic recovery ahead
Exports upholding modest growth in 2013

Real GDP growth remained weak over the first
half of 2013, registering an increase of ¼% y-o-y
(non-seasonally adjusted data). Growth was driven
by net exports and a surge in public expenditure,
whereas household consumption contracted.
Relative to the pre-crisis peak levels in 2008,
export volumes are by now one-fifth higher, while
domestic demand and particularly investments are
still markedly lower. The rebalancing of the
economy towards the export sector is expected to
lessen in the second half of 2013, with private
consumption projected to strengthen in the coming
quarters, as also indicated by the robust increase of
retail trade recorded in July-August. The
purchasing power of consumers is buoyed by the
projected growth in real wages in a low inflation
environment. Also, pensions were discretionarily
hiked by over 9% in April 2013, after having been
frozen over the previous years.

activity. It is supported by the relatively strong
financial sector, which has been capable of
upholding credit to the private sector over the
crisis years. Also, both deposit and lending interest
rates have continued on a downward trend,
implying an easing on lending conditions and
credit availability.
Exports are forecast to remain relatively strong
also over 2014-15, following the projected growth
in global demand. In turn, the rebound in domestic
consumption and investment would also drive up
imports to some extent and turn the growth
contribution from net exports slightly negative.
The current-account balance is therefore forecast
to turn into a small deficit of about ½% of GDP by
2015.

forecast

The pick-up of economic activity towards the end
of the year is expected to be reinforced by the
projected economic recovery in the EU.
Nevertheless, GDP growth is expected to reach
only 0.5% for the year as a whole, which remains
well below the estimated potential growth rate of
the economy, but the growth momentum towards
the end of 2013 is forecast to entail a positive
carry-over effect for next year.

Growth to accelerate in 2014-15

Economic activity is projected to strengthen over
the forecast period, reaching 1.5% in 2014 and
1.8% in 2015. Household consumption and private
investment are expected to increasingly contribute
to growth, after an extended period of rebalancing
following the economic crisis. The forecast
assumes that the recent stabilisation of the labour
market is sustained over the coming years,
supporting
household
confidence
and
consumption. However, the recovery is expected to
be relatively slow compared to many other
converging economies, given that the significant
population decline (due to ageing and emigration)
continues to erode the growth potential and the
consumption base.
The gradual recovery in private investment is
forecast to follow the rebound in economic

48

Risks to this macroeconomic forecast seem
broadly balanced. The most significant downside
risk is related to the expected recovery in
household consumption, which could prove
weaker than expected given that the Bulgarian
labour market and household sentiment are still
fragile. However, as observed over the recent
years, in periods of weaker domestic demand the
Bulgarian economy has been able to partly
compensate with higher exports and gains in
global market shares.
Early signs of stabilisation of the labour market

After a marked drop in employment over the past
four years, the situation in the labour market seems
to be stabilising in 2013. This is mainly the result
of developments in the traditionally volatile

Member States, Bulgaria

agricultural sector, reflecting a good harvest in
2013, but employment in other sectors of the
economy also appears to be stabilising.
Unemployment is expected to peak at almost 13%
of the labour force in 2013 and decline slowly to
below 12% by 2015.
Sharply decelerating inflation in 2013

Inflation has decelerated sharply over 2013 and is
projected to average 0.5% in the year. This is
primarily driven by falling energy prices, given the
global oil price trends and domestic measures to
reduce administratively-set electricity prices. Also,
the good agricultural harvest has led to lower
unprocessed food prices. Furthermore, core
inflation has decelerated over 2013. While
inflation is forecast to rebound in 2014 as the base
effects from the currently low energy and food
prices fade, the overall inflationary pressures are
expected to remain low also in that year. Inflation
is forecast to accelerate slightly in 2015 to about
2%, in line with the projected recovery in domestic
demand and the on-going convergence of prices
towards EU average.

Fiscal expansion in 2013

The general government deficit is set to increase
substantially, from 0.8% of GDP in 2012 to 2% of
GDP in 2013. This is due to a combination of
weak economic growth and a fiscal stimulus
implemented in 2013, following three years of
fiscal consolidation. Additional spending is mainly
for social expenditure (including the discretionary
hike to pensions), investments and various current
expenditure items.
The present forecast was finalised before the
submission of the 2014 budget to parliament and
thus does not reflect any new fiscal measures for
2014-15. The general government fiscal deficit is
set to remain broadly at the 2013 level, at 2% of
GDP in 2014 and 1.8% in 2015. In structural
terms, the deficit is estimated to weaken from ½%
of GDP in 2012 to 1½% of GDP in 2013 and to
stay at about that level over 2014-15. This implies
an expansionary fiscal stance in 2013 and a neutral
one over 2014-15. The general government gross
debt is forecast to increase from 18.5% in 2012 to
24% of GDP in 2015.

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
Positive signals prevail but the recovery has yet to gain pace
Economic activity is firming up

After six consecutive quarters of negative growth,
real GDP increased by 0.6% in the second quarter
of 2013, marking the end of the longest period of
declining economic activity since 1993. In an
economy already negatively affected by a weak
external environment, recurring cuts in investment
in the public sector, increases in energy and food
prices and repeated hikes in indirect taxes
negatively affected the disposable income of
households and investment of firms. As these
factors gradually ease off, growth is expected to
resume. While stronger external demand and
restocking are likely to support the recovery in
2014, household consumption and gross fixed
capital formation are expected to become the key
drivers of growth in 2015.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

15

The profile of real GDP growth has recently been
strongly influenced by anticipation effects of the
January 2013 hikes in the value added tax and in
excise taxes. Real GDP fell by 1.3% in the first
quarter of 2013 compared to the last quarter of
2012, which was the largest quarter-on-quarter
decrease observed since the beginning of 2009.
Similarly, the increase in taxes on cigarettes in
January 2014 is also expected to produce
anticipation effects at the end of 2013 with
repercussions on the following quarters.
Recovery is still fragile...

Since the spring of 2013, surveys of economic
sentiment, retail sales and new orders have mostly
shown positive signals. However, the growth of

50

value added has yet to strengthen. The highest
contribution to output growth in the first half of
2013 was provided by financial and insurance
activities, which account for a relatively small and
volatile part of the economy, while value added in
the manufacturing sector continued to fall. The
large share of part-time workers in the growth of
headcount employment is a further illustration that
the recovery has yet to gain pace. Labour demand
is still low, as evidenced by the persistently low
level of vacancies. Credit conditions have
remained broadly unchanged and credit supply is
not considered a major factor limiting production.
...and the outlook for consumption
investment remains subdued

and

Household consumption is expected to grow by
1.0% in 2014 as current labour market conditions
do not foreshadow a dynamic growth of nominal
wages. In addition, employment growth is likely to
remain constrained by the decrease in the
population of working age. However, unlike in
previous years, household income developments
are not expected to be negatively affected by
further discretionary increases in taxation. Lower
inflation expected in 2014 is also likely to support
real income growth. A more resolute improvement
in consumption supported by drawing down
savings is a positive risk for the forecast.
Gross fixed capital formation is likely to firm up
only in the course of 2014 as the growing volume
of new orders can still be accommodated within
the existing production capacities. Moreover,
surveys of lending conditions do not point to rising
demand for credit in the short run and growth in
residential construction is limited by the supply of
unsold housing units. Overall, domestic demand is
expected to appreciably strengthen only in 2015,
along with improved labour market conditions and
recovering confidence in the corporate sector.
On the back of the improving foreign demand and
the sluggish growth in domestic demand expected
for most of 2014, net exports provide a positive
contribution to growth in 2014 and to some extent
also in 2015. This is mirrored in the projected
improvement in the current account balance over
the forecast horizon. Risks to the development of
net exports are broadly balanced.

Member States, The Czech Republic

Limited inflationary pressures

Inflation is expected to average 1.4% in 2013,
mostly due to increases in food prices and the
hikes in indirect taxes mentioned above. The netof-tax growth in prices of most consumer goods is
already subdued. In 2014, inflation is projected to
fall markedly to 0.5%, due to a large reduction in
energy prices also because of the pre-announced
drop in regulated prices of electricity. A somewhat
stronger contribution of demand factors is
expected to bolster inflation again in 2015. Over
the forecast horizon, inflation is not expected to be
substantially influenced by changes in indirect
taxes and neither are prices of imported goods and
services expected to become a significant source of
cost pressures. In line with the subdued growth in
nominal wages, unit labour costs are forecast to
remain broadly stable.
General government deficit to stabilise in 2014

The general government deficit is expected to
reach 2.9% of GDP. This outcome is underpinned
by consolidation measures of 0.7 pp. of GDP, of
which about two thirds fall on the revenue side.
The main measures include increases in both the

reduced and standard VAT rate by 1 pp. and a
lower indexation of pensions. Public investment is
forecast to bottom out in 2013, at some 35% below
its 2009 peak. The structural deficit is projected to
improve by around ½ pp. to 1½% of GDP in 2013.
The general government deficit is forecast to
stabilise at around 3% of GDP in 2014 and to
increase in 2015 in the absence of additional
measures. The forecast for 2014 factors in savings
on the expenditure side due to lower indexation of
pensions (0.2% of GDP), increases in several
excises taxes (0.1% of GDP) and a one-off revenue
from the sale of newly released frequency ranges
(0.3% of GDP). The projected deterioration in the
general government deficit in 2015 is largely due
to the reform of the personal income tax adopted in
2011, with a deficit-increasing impact of about
0.4% of GDP. The structural deficit is expected to
increase by around ¾ pp. in both 2014 and 2015.
The fiscal forecast is subject to risks of a higher
deficit related to the substantial changes that may
still affect the 2014 budget whilst a postponement
of the income tax reform in 2015 would result in a
lower-than-forecast general government deficit.

4. DENMARK
Growth set to recover amidst improved confidence
Turnaround after three years of standstill

The recovery of the Danish economy came to a
halt in 2012 and GDP fell by 0.4%. Exports were
weak due to headwinds in the international
economy and widespread uncertainty held back
private domestic demand.
After three years of economic standstill, indicators
are now pointing to an improvement in the Danish
economy, with positive readings of confidence
indicators, growing industrial production and
increasing house prices. Real GDP is, however,
only expected to grow by 0.3% in 2013, primarily
due to negative carry-over effects from the end of
last year and a weak development at the beginning
of this year. In 2014 and 2015, growth is expected
to be mainly driven by domestic demand,
supported by mildly positive growth contributions
from net exports. Real GDP is forecast to grow by
1¾% in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

period. Overall, the labour market has been
relatively stable despite the weak recovery since
2009. One possible explanation is the influence of
an adjustment in sectors with relatively low
employment intensity, such as North Sea oil
extraction and the financial sector. Looking
beyond these two capital intensive sectors, the
recovery in the remaining part of the private sector
– which stands for 95% of private employment –
has been much more pronounced.

Private consumption is supported by growth in
households' real disposable income, partly due to
positive effects from the 2012 tax reform, lower
interest rates and the drop in inflation. Consumer
confidence – including the consumer's view on the
labour market prospects – has improved
significantly over the summer and is expected to
support private consumption.
Exports are projected to pick-up in line with the
expected improvement in external demand and the
wage competitiveness losses over the last 10 years
being partly reversed, enabling Danish companies
to take better advantage of growth in Danish
export markets.
Business investment has been weak since the
outbreak of the financial crisis and savings in the
corporate sector are historically high. The
'investment window' tax breaks – which will
continue until the end of this year – provide
incentives for businesses to frontload their
investments to 2013. In combination with the
measures included in the "Growth Plan DK" and
an improved outlook for external demand this is
expected to lead to a temporary boost of business
investment in the second half of 2013.
The pick-up in economic activity is set to lead to
moderate growth in employment in the forecast

Competitiveness is improving

HICP inflation has decreased significantly in the
first three quarters of 2013 and stood at 0.2% in
September. The low inflation is partly related to
excise tax cuts at the beginning of this year as well
as a reduction of insurance prices.
Wage growth has been historically low, reflecting
the slack in the labour market, and external price
competitiveness has improved significantly over
the last couple of years due to a more moderate
wage growth compared to Denmark's main trading
partners, as well as a pick-up in productivity
growth. The improvement in the external price
competitiveness is projected to continue in the
forecast period.
The risks to the macroeconomic outlook appear to
be broadly balanced. As a small and open
economy, Denmark is highly dependent on
developments abroad. The high private debt level
makes the economy vulnerable to sudden increases
in interest rates. On the other hand, the high saving
rate in the non-financial corporate sector may lead

Member States, Denmark

to higher investment in case of a more pronounced
improvement in sentiment.
Public finances are improving

The general government balance is expected to be
around -1¾% of GDP in 2013 and 2014 and to
deteriorate to -2¾% in 2015, still below 3%, but
with a significantly smaller safety margin.
The upward revision of the fiscal balance for 2014
compared to the spring forecast is the consequence
of the extension of the possibility to move forward
taxation of existing capital pension schemes at
favourable conditions from the end of 2013 to the
end of 2014. This measure has been assumed to
increase government revenues temporarily by
DKK 20bn (around 1% of GDP) in both 2013 and
2014.
Public consumption is projected to grow
moderately over the forecast horizon. The
expenditure ceilings adopted by the Danish

parliament in June 2013 are expected to improve
the fiscal control at central, regional and local
level. Public investment has a somewhat volatile
profile in the forecast years. In 2012, it reached the
highest level since the early 1980s, due to
frontloading of investments related to the 'kickstart' package. This frontloading will come to an
end in 2013, leading to a steep fall in public
investment in this year. The Government has
planned a new increase in public investments in
2014.
The structural balance is projected to be stable at
close to 0% in 2013 and 2014 and to decrease
again thereafter to -¼% in 2015. Excluding very
volatile items, such as revenues from North Sea oil
extraction and from the pension yield taxes, the
structural balance is set to improve by ¼-½% of
GDP annually on average from 2011 to 2013.
The general government gross debt is expected to
remain below 50% of GDP over the forecast
period.

5. GERMANY
Steady expansion ahead
Growth to settle at moderate rates

After a 0.5% (q-o-q, seasonally and working-day
adjusted) decline in the fourth quarter of 2012, real
GDP stabilised in the first quarter of 2013 and rose
markedly in the second quarter (0.7%). The
unusually harsh winter took its toll on activity in
the first quarter, especially on construction, while
significant catching-up effects boosted GDP
growth in the second quarter. Domestic demand, in
particular private consumption and changes in
inventories, made the main contributions to growth
in the first two quarters of 2013, while the
contribution of gross fixed capital formation was
negative.
Going forward, indicators point to a continued
expansion at a more moderate pace in the coming
quarters, with weather-related catching-up effects
in the second quarter of 2013 likely to have
overstated the underlying growth dynamics.
Manufacturing production signals only a slight
increase in output in the third quarter of 2013,
while orders indicate a further rise in the coming
months. Recent surveys reflect overall positive
sentiment of households and firms, with notably
the latter expecting a continued increase in
production for the coming months.

a small increase in machinery and equipment
investment. Dissipating uncertainty, slowly rising
capacity utilisation and favourable financing
conditions are set to underpin a further gradual
recovery over the forecast horizon. The upswing
could be less dynamic than in previous upturns,
reflecting a lasting downward shift in sales
expectations given adjustment processes in Europe
and slower growth in emerging markets. In
construction, catching-up is still on-going after the
weather-related collapse in the first quarter of
2013, but the expansion should moderate going
forward. With housing activity already at a high
level, its growth rate is set to decelerate. This
should only gradually be offset by the acceleration
of other construction activity alongside capacityincreasing equipment investment.

Overall, real GDP is projected to grow by 0.5% in
2013 and by 1.7% in 2014. This is 0.1 pp. higher
and 0.1 pp. lower, respectively, than projected in
spring. The revision for 2014 reflects slightly
lower projected export growth in the coming
quarters on the back of a slowdown of economic
activity in non-EU countries and a slightly less
favourable exchange rate development than
assumed earlier. By contrast, the positive outlook
for domestic demand remains unchanged. With
private consumption supported by low interest
rates, rising wages and robust employment growth,
together with the expected gradual pick-up in
investment, domestic demand is projected to
continue to act as the main growth driver over the
forecast horizon. In 2015, economic activity is
expected to see only a further slight acceleration.
Together with a higher number of working days,
this should result in an annual growth rate of 1.9%.

Negative net export contribution to growth on
the back of strong domestic demand

Export growth is set to accelerate slightly less than
projected in spring. Export expectations remain at
a quite optimistic level but foreign industrial
orders have not increased significantly lately.
Import growth is set to increase more strongly than
export growth as equipment investments pick up.
This is expected to contribute to a stabilisation of
the current-account surplus this year and to some
narrowing by 2015.
Net migration boosting supply in robust labour
market

The unemployment rate is at a record low, yet a
further gradual rise in employment is expected.
Despite considerable net migration and the

Member States, Germany

continuing trend increase in labour market
participation, this is set to result in a further
gradual reduction in the unemployment rate. After
a temporary deceleration in 2013, growth in wages
and compensation per employee is set to
reaccelerate, so unit labour cost growth would
remain above the euro-area average.
Inflation moderating further

Consumer price growth is forecast to slow to 1.7%
in 2013 and 2014 and further to 1.6% in 2015.
Core inflation is projected to accelerate moderately
on the back of rising scope for passing on higher
labour costs to consumers. This is expected to be
more than offset by the easing of energy and food
price pressure over the forecast horizon.

results mainly from the new childcare allowance
for parents not making use of childcare facilities,
the abolition of the expenditure-reducing quarterly
fee for medical treatment, wage increases in the
public sector and the set-up of a restructuring fund
in response to this year's flood disaster. Overall,
the general government budget is forecast to
remain broadly balanced and the structural balance
to stabilise at a small surplus over the forecast
horizon, resulting in a declining gross debt-to-GDP
ratio. The on-going winding up of "bad banks"
could further reduce the debt stock.

Domestic demand driving growth while trade surplus shrinking
Disappointing growth in the first half of 2013

Real GDP growth dropped to 1.2% y-o-y in the
first half of 2013, from 3.9% in 2012. Investment
growth came to a standstill as public investment
fell with the end of a number of environmental
projects and the completion of most EU co-funded
projects, while weak demand continued to weigh
on corporate investment. In parallel, lower
domestic demand in Finland together with the
diversion of oil-related transit trade from Baltic to
new Russian ports led to quasi-stagnation in
Estonia's exports volumes, in particular in services,
while imports continued to grow. Moreover, as
output growth decelerated and employment
increased, productivity growth in the economy fell,
while wage growth picked up substantially,
leading to losses in competitiveness. Consumption
continued to support economic growth, as
household income is strengthening thanks to strong
real wage growth, rising employment and higher
pensions. Overall, economic growth is expected to
be only 1.3% in 2013.

Positive growth outlook for 2014 and 2015

With
investment
and
external
demand
progressively recovering, the economy is expected
to regain momentum with growth forecast at 3.0%
in 2014 and 3.9% in 2015. Capacity utilisation is
now close to its long-term average. This is
expected to prompt increases in production
capacity from 2014 as demand has started
recovering. Indeed, profitability has largely been
restored, despite the recent wage increases. Public
investment is expected to revert to growth in the

56

course of 2015, when the 2014-20 package of EU
funds will start being implemented.
Consumption growth is forecast to remain
vigorous, supported by real income growth
including from income tax cuts in 2015.
Household borrowing is forecast to increase only
moderately despite very low or negative interest
rates, as banks will remain cautious towards the
still relatively high private sector indebtedness.
Finally, as domestic demand gathers pace, with
investment progressively recovering, higher
growth in imports than in exports is expected to
feed into a slightly negative trade balance in 2015,
despite Estonia's recovering exports growth to its
main trading partners. Downside risks to the
forecast could stem from wages rising faster than
expected, thereby limiting competitiveness and
corporate investment; also demand in both Finland
and Russia could be lower than anticipated.
Large wage increases in a tightening labour
market…

Despite the slowing output growth, employment
expanded further in the first half of 2013, which is
partly explained by the lagged effect of more
vigorous growth in 2012. At the same time, the
unemployment rate fell to 8% in the second quarter
of 2013, down from over 10% a year earlier.
Employment is expected to grow further and
unemployment to continue contracting over the
forecast horizon, as output growth regains
momentum. Labour force participation is high at
close to 69% and is set to slightly increase over the
forecast horizon, given the changing age structure
of the working age population. Nominal wage
growth accelerated to 8.5% in the second quarter
of 2013, with real wage growth reaching 4.8%.
This is driven by persistent skill mismatches and
rising vacancies, recent minimum wage increases,
pay agreements for health workers and teachers as
well as fast wage catching up in traded services. In
2014 and 2015, nominal wage growth is expected
to stabilise at around 7% and real wage growth at
around 4%, reflecting solid output growth, further
minimum wage increases by 10% each year and
unemployment hovering around its natural rate.
…while inflation stabilises around 3%

With the impact of earlier global commodity price
increases fading out, annual HICP inflation

Member States, Estonia

receded to 2.6% in September, down from 4.1% in
June. Inflation is expected to average 3.4% in
2013, despite recent price increases in unprocessed
food and electricity and hikes in alcohol and
tobacco excise duties. The assumed decline in
global commodity prices and the fading impact of
the recent electricity price increases are expected
to ensure that inflation will continue its slow
decline, so as to reach 2.8% in 2014. However,
rising core inflation reflecting strong wage growth
and a further excise tax increase on alcohol are set
to push inflation back slightly above 3% in 2015.
Small fiscal deficits continuing

The general government balance is forecast to
show a small deficit of 0.4% of GDP in 2013. The
postponement of the dividend distribution from
state owned companies had a negative effect on the
fiscal outcome. However, tax revenue is expected
to remain strong despite relatively slow real GDP
growth.
In 2014 the deficit is forecast to narrow to 0.1% of
GDP. On the one hand, the public wage bill is
projected to increase by 5.1% and pensions by

5.8%, while the compensation mechanism for the
second pillar pension contributions will have a
negative effect on the revenue. On the other hand,
a sizeable revenue-enhancing package will enter
into force. This includes further excise tax
increases, a rescheduling of dividend distribution
from state-owned companies, limiting VAT
deductibility for corporate cars and other measures
aimed at improving tax collection. The VATrelated changes are announced to take effect as of
mid-2014.
On a no-policy-change basis, an unchanged
government balance is projected for 2015. In the
course of the year, public investment is expected to
revert to growth as the 2014-20 package of EU
funds will start being implemented. The income
tax rate cut by 1 pp. to 20% scheduled for
1 January 2015 will contribute to a decline in the
tax burden.
In structural terms, the fiscal position is forecast to
have deteriorated by ½ pp. of GDP in 2013 and to
improve by a similar amount in 2014; in 2015, on
a no-policy-change basis, it is expected to widen
by some ¼ pp. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected
to remain below 10% of GDP over the forecast
horizon.

Rebalancing on track
Growth
situation
stabilising
challenging than earlier thought

but

more

National accounts data for the first half of 2013
show that the economy continues to contract on an
annual basis.(21) GDP growth, however, turned
positive in quarterly terms in the second quarter,
and a more robust performance is expected for the
second half of the year which underpins the current
forecast of 0.3% growth in 2013. High-frequency
indicators through the third quarter paint a
consistently more positive picture than the national
accounts, while price developments were muted
and competitiveness measures continued to
improve. Sovereign-bond yields on the secondary
market remained around pre-crisis levels and
banks' funding situation improved, although
lending to the economy continued to contract amid
stable retail interest rates.

merchandise exports are now lower (mainly on
account of structural factors), the contribution of
net exports to growth is virtually unchanged as the
high import-export ratio for the expenditure
category also prompts corresponding revisions to
imports. The current-account surplus is expected to
remain at historically very high levels, supported
initially mainly by continuously elevated factor
income flows and later also improving net exports.
The unemployment rate is forecast to decline faster
than previously thought, but remain elevated.
Uncertainty surrounding the timing and magnitude
of the negative effects of the expiring
pharmaceutical patents constitute a downside risk
to goods' export performance over the projection
period. The improving labour and property market
situation should however gradually allow for both
continued deleveraging and increasing private
consumption, which is therefore subject to upside
risks. Although core investment (excluding
aircraft) has started to expand again, the
investment-to-GDP ratio remains historically very
low which suggests ample scope for further
expansion, especially in the non-cash constrained
multinational sector.

Real GDP (y-o-y %)

Unemployment has fallen by almost two
percentage points since its crisis peak to 13.3% in
September 2013, while outward migration is
beginning to decline. Employment has been
growing for three consecutive quarters, including
full-time jobs. Earnings remain weak amid the
still-considerable slack.

The 2013 deficit is estimated at 7.4% of GDP.
Compared to the previous forecast, a lower
denominator effect resulting from downward
revisions to nominal GDP and a downward
reassessment of tax revenue is offset by significant
interest expenditure savings and a reclassification
from 2012 to 2013 of revenues from the sale of
mobile telephone licenses. Primary expenditure is
expected to be in line with budget allocations and
spending pressures in the health sector are
expected to be addressed by contingency
measures.

Balanced macroeconomic risks

Real GDP growth rates have been revised down
until 2015 compared to the spring 2013 forecast on
the
back
of
the
weaker-than-expected
developments in especially private consumption
during the first half of the year. While projected
(21)

58

The estimated carry-over is -0.7% for 2013 as a whole after
the second quarter The 2012 GDP growth rate has also
been revised down from a first estimate of 0.9% to 0.2%
since the spring 2013 forecast.

In 2014, the general government deficit is
projected at 5.0% of GDP including consolidation
measures of 1.5% of GDP, of which one-third is
on the revenue side and two-thirds on expenditure.
Revenue measures include higher excises on
alcohol and tobacco, an increase in the deposit
interest retention tax rate, increase in levy on
pension fund assets and a new levy on financial
institutions. Moreover, the full-year effect of the
property tax and other tax measures from the last

Member States, Ireland

year will produce benefits in 2014. Expenditure
measures include further wage savings from the
renewed public service wage agreement, tighter
eligibility for social benefits (benefits for young
unemployed,
maternity
benefits,
and
supplementary payments to households), savings
on the cost of medicines by increasing copayments, restricting eligibility and reducing cost
per item.
The deterioration of the 2014 deficit forecast by
some 0.7 pp. of GDP, as compared to the spring
forecast, reflects both the carry-over of weakerthan-expected trends in tax revenues in 2013 and
lower economic growth in 2014, while windfall
savings from the exchange of the promissory notes
with long-dated government bonds are expected be
used to accelerate deficit and debt reduction. A
lower fiscal effort on the revenue and expenditure
side is offset by one-off revenues from the sale of
the National Lottery licence to be recorded in
2014, and interest rate savings on the back of a
favourable interest rate environment and lower
precautionary cash balances.

adjustment of 1.4% of GDP; 0.4% of GDP in
revenue measures and 1% of GDP in expenditure
measures. The structural fiscal balance is projected
to narrow from 6.7% of GDP in 2013 to 3.3% of
GDP.(22) Uncertainty around the growth prospects
of the Irish economy are among the main risks to
the fiscal forecast. Further risks relate to the
effective implementation of the public service
wage agreement and of structural reforms in the
health sector. Finally, one-off costs may arise in
2013 in case of a possible shortfall in the asset
sales linked to the winding-up of the Irish Banking
Resolution Corporation (IBRC), which the
government would have to compensate.
Government debt is projected to peak at 124% of
GDP in 2013 and decline thereafter as primary
surpluses are achieved and economic growth picks
up. Moreover, a reduction in the currently high
precautionary cash balances of around 13% of
GDP at end-2013 to around 7% by 2015 will
contribute to narrowing of the debt-to-GDP ratio.
(22)

In 2015, the general government deficit is
projected at 3.0% of GDP assuming a fiscal

The structural balance is net of one-off guarantee payments
related to the liquidation of IBRC in 2013 (0.7% of GDP),
one-off revenue from the sale of mobile telephone licenses
in 2013 (0.4% of GDP), one-off revenue from the sale of
the National Lottery licence in 2014 (0.2% of GDP), as
well as one-off financial sector measures for credit unions
in 2014 and 2015 (less than 0.1% of GDP in each year).

8. GREECE
Economic recovery in sight
Strong tourism revival as Greece regains
stability and competitiveness

The first half of 2013 was marked by an overall
softening of the recession and the first signs of
reaching the bottom of the cycle. For the last three
quarters, real GDP has been contracting at a
decelerating pace: by a -5.7% y-o-y in the final
quarter of 2012 and -5.6% in the first quarter 2013
to -3.8% in the second quarter.
A strong revival of tourism has occurred over the
summer. Greece has benefited from increased
competitiveness against other popular holiday
destinations. Following the sharp improvement of
confidence and financial indicators (ESI, PMI,
government bond spreads) in the first half of the
year, and despite their temporary weakening in
spring due to uncertainties over the Cypriot
programme, tourism triggered the improvement in
the second quarter of 2013 and should also support
a good GDP reading in the next one. Despite a
further concentration of tax payments in the last
quarter of 2013, which is expected to weigh on
consumption, real GDP growth has been revised
upwards for 2013 and is now projected at -4.0%.
The repayment of government arrears and the
faster absorption of the EU and EIB funds through
the re-launch of major projects – such as motorway
construction – is expected to help alleviate
liquidity constraints and support investment in
2014. The bank recapitalisation process and
economic stabilisation are also supportive. Led by
exports and investment, real GDP is expected to
expand in 2014 at an annual growth rate of 0.6%.
In contrast, private consumption is expected to still
decline, in line with aggregate disposable income.
In 2015, the recovery is forecast to gain strength,
as investment becomes the main engine of the
recovery. A rebound in exports in the context of
the euro-area recovery should support a revival in
goods export growth as well as stronger shipping
and tourism revenues. With consumption no longer
being a drag, real GDP growth is projected at
2.9%.
The unemployment rate is projected to reach
27.0% in 2013 owing to falling aggregate demand.
However, wage setting reforms have already

60

contributed to a sharp improvement in cost
competitiveness leading to a relatively strong
projected decrease of unemployment to 26.0% in
2014 and 24.0% in 2015.
Consumer prices are expected to fall moderately
by 0.8% in 2013 and 0.4% in 2014, reflecting
weak domestic demand, falling unit labour costs
and the implementation of product market reforms.
As the economic recovery gains pace, prices are
expected to increase weakly by 0.3% in 2015.
The current-account deficit is projected at -2.3% of
GDP for 2013 and is expected to narrow to -1.9%
in 2014 and -1.6% in 2015, as export and import
growth pick up along with the economic recovery.
Risks, on the upside, are related to a faster return
in confidence, more permanent spillovers by the
positive tourism period and/or a stronger liquidity
impact of the arrears clearance. On the downside,
policy implementation slippages could undermine
confidence, especially for 2014-15, affecting the
extent and speed of investment and export
recovery.

Budgetary situation continues to improve

In structural terms, the budgetary adjustment has
been very large, leading to a projected structural
surplus in 2013, up from a deficit of nearly 15% in
2009, reflecting a clear turnaround in the fiscal
position compared to the beginning of the crisis.
The headline general government deficit is now
estimated to be 9% of GDP in 2012, one
percentage point lower than estimated at the time

of the spring forecast, reflecting smaller one-off
costs associated with the resolution of three banks.

headline deficit is expected to reach about 1% of
GDP in 2015 in line with the programme targets.

The headline general government deficit in ESA95
terms is expected to stand at around 13.5% of GDP
in 2013. This includes the bank recapitalisation
costs (10.6% of GDP) increasing the deficit, the
transfers received from Member States
corresponding to profits on Greek bonds held by
the Eurosystem Central Banks (about 1.5% of
GDP) and other small factors. In programme
terms, which exclude the factors above, the deficit
is expected at around 4% of GDP.

The ratio of government debt to GDP is expected
to peak at some 176% in 2013. After a marginal
reduction in 2014, the debt ratio will decline more
markedly in 2015 and beyond the forecast horizon
as the fiscal balance continues to improve and
economic growth resumes.

In 2014, the headline deficit is expected to fall to
2% of GDP. If further bank recapitalisation costs
have to be recorded in 2014, the headline deficit
would increase beyond what is currently forecast.
Current projections assume that any fiscal gaps for
2014 and 2015 are filled through measures to be
discussed during the on-going review. In structural
terms, the balance will remain more or less

Return to positive growth
Prospects of a moderate recovery, amidst
continuing adjustment of imbalances

Following nine quarters of negative growth, the
Spanish economy appears to be embarking on a
moderate recovery in the second half of 2013,
supported by the pick-up in the rest of the EU and
policy progress at home. Net exports remain the
main growth driver, while domestic demand is
exerting less of a drag. The current account has
moved into a surplus, which is projected to
increase further over the forecast horizon, although
at a slower pace than recently.
Still large adjustment needs will constrain the
strength of the recovery. Credit continues
contracting, driven to a large extent by weak
demand but also by some frictions on the supply
side. In spite of recent improvements in wholesale
financial markets for the sovereign and banks
(reducing significantly borrowing from the
Eurosystem), financing conditions for households
and companies remain relatively tight, in particular
for smaller borrowers. The on-going bank
restructuring and recapitalisation process, already
well advanced in the context of the financial sector
programme, is helping banks to regain the capacity
to access capital markets at competitive rates and
should support a gradual relaxation of lending
conditions over time.
Real GDP is expected to contract by 1.3% in 2013,
after -1.6% in 2012. Preliminary data indicate that
GDP growth has turned marginally positive in the
third quarter of 2013, driven by strong exports and
some stabilisation in the labour market. The latter
also point to a positive impact of the labour market
reforms. These trends are expected to persist over
the forecast horizon. As a result, GDP is set to
grow by 0.5% in 2014. This rate of growth reflects
stronger underlying dynamics than in the spring
forecast, when the fiscal adjustment factored in the
current forecast was not yet taken into account. In
2015, GDP growth is projected at 1.7%, which
partly reflects the no-policy-change assumption.
Indeed, some temporary tax measures are still set
to expire that year, deteriorating the headline and
structural budget balance. While challenges and
vulnerabilities related to the adjustment process
remain large, there is also some upside risks to the
forecasts from a possible stronger pick-up in
domestic demand than projected.

62

Domestic demand slowly stabilising

Real gross disposable income and private
consumption growth are expected to turn
marginally positive in 2014 and the saving rate is
projected to stabilise.
Investment in equipment is being supported by
robust exports and the need for machine
replacement after several years of sharply
declining investment. Construction will however
still contract at a high pace, and there is no sign yet
of stabilisation in residential investment.

Net external demand
Domestic demand incl. inventories
GDP (y-oy%)

Exports have remained resilient. Lower recent
demand from outside the EU has been
compensated by a redirection towards European
destinations. Going forward, imports are expected
to strengthen on the back of growing exports and
less subdued domestic demand. The trade surplus
is projected to widen over the forecast horizon.
Wages and inflation moderate

The unemployment rate declined to a still very
high 26.0% in the third quarter of 2013. The
decline was largely driven by a contraction of the
labour force and some seasonal factors.
Unemployment is projected to fall gradually over
the forecast horizon, as the labour force continues
to shrink and employment destruction reaches a
turning point in the course of 2014. Productivity,
which has in recent years been boosted by labour
shedding and sectorial reallocation, is expected to
decelerate. However, wage moderation will still
allow for improvements in nominal ULC over the

Member States, Spain

forecast horizon. Inflation is expected to remain
low as the impact of fiscal measures taken in 2012
disappears, domestic demand remains weak and
wages do not push up production costs.
Fiscal consolidation set to continue, but at
slower pace

The general government deficit for 2012 was
revised down to 6.8% of GDP (from 7%), net of
bank recapitalisations amounting to 3.8% of GDP.
This revision essentially reflects a better budget
balance for local communities than initially
estimated. In 2013, fiscal consolidation is expected
to continue, but at a more moderate pace.
Discretionary measures of around 3% of GDP,
including the full-year impact of VAT increases
and further expenditure restraint, should more than
offset the negative budgetary impact of the
continued recession and rising social and interest
expenditure. The general government deficit is
currently expected to narrow to 6.5% of GDP for
the full year (net of bank recapitalisation costs of
about 0.3% of GDP), but considerable downside
risks remain. Despite major consolidation
measures having taken effect in the second half of
2012, the budgetary improvement in the first half

of 2013 was limited to around 0.2 pp. Tax
revenues in particular remained relatively weak so
far and will have to pick up noticeably in the
second half of the year.
The 2014 draft Budget Bill confirmed previously
announced expenditure and revenue measures and
against the background of positive, albeit weak,
real GDP growth, the general government deficit is
expected to shrink to 5.9% of GDP in 2014. This
projection is underpinned by the extension of some
tax measures that were previously expected to
expire. While interest and pension expenditure are
expected to rise further, falling unemployment and
the change in the pension indexation formula
should contribute to a deceleration of social
transfers in 2014. Under a no-policy-change
assumption, the headline deficit is expected to
widen to 6.6% of GDP in 2015. The structural
deficit is estimated to be close to -4¼% of GDP in
2013 and 2014 before rising to 5¾% in 2015.
Large public deficits and low nominal GDP
growth are projected to push the general
government gross debt to above 100% of GDP
over the forecast horizon.

Gradual recovery ahead
Firm growth outlook only in the medium term

Business confidence is improving

After two quarters of recession, real GDP growth
rebounded sharply (0.5%) in the second quarter of
2013, partly driven by temporary factors. Activity
is then expected to decelerate before slowly
picking up again in 2014. The acceleration in
external demand in 2014 is set to support exports,
while private consumption is forecast to remain
resilient despite on-going fiscal consolidation and
investment is projected to increase only slightly.
All in all, real GDP growth is forecast at 0.2% in
2013 and 0.9% in 2014.

The resilience of economic growth in 2013 as a
whole seems to have led to an improvement in
business confidence in a context of stable lending
conditions. However, entrepreneurs are likely to
give priority to the restoration of their profit
margins, before considering investing. The recent
tax credit for competitiveness, aiming in particular
at strengthening firms' financial situation, together
with the expected rise in capacity utilisation are
therefore set to slowly push up corporate
investment during 2014. Only in 2015 with the
increase in aggregate demand, together with
strengthened profitability, should a firm pick up in
investment take place.

Graph II.10.1:France - Real GDP growth and contributions
pps.
forecast

A relatively weak external sector

In 2015, under the usual no-policy-change
assumption and thanks to improved confidence,
private consumption, the traditional growth driver
of the French economy, is forecast to pick up and
stimulate aggregate demand and in turn firms'
investment, pushing real GDP growth up to 1.7%.

Export growth is set to accelerate as from 2014 on
the back of an expected rebound in external
demand. The recent competitiveness reforms are
expected to gradually reduce the pace of losses in
export market shares, although without fully
reversing the trend. Export growth is therefore
projected to remain slightly below that of world
demand over the forecast horizon. With imports
picking up due to the gradual increase in aggregate
demand, net exports are expected to contribute
only marginally to growth in 2014 (0.1 pp.) and to
even slightly dampen it in 2015 (-0.1 pp.).

Resilient private consumption

Increasing unemployment, low inflation

In 2013 and 2014, private consumption is expected
to grow moderately (by 0.5% and 0.6%) in line
with a relatively strong population increase (0.5%),
therefore implying a stabilisation of consumption
per capita. Real disposable income is set to benefit
from low inflation, although it will also be
dampened by the negative impact of rising
unemployment and tax increases. In an
environment
where
confidence
improves,
households are expected to draw somewhat on
their savings to smooth their consumption
spending. In 2015, the pick-up in real disposable
income associated with moderate employment
growth is forecast to lead to stronger private
consumption (growth of 1.6%).

In the current context of subdued growth,
employers are likely to favour increasing
productivity over job creation throughout 2014.
However, subsidised job schemes in the public
sector are assumed to stimulate somewhat total
employment in 2014. The positive effects of the
recent labour market reform are only expected to
be visible from 2015. Meanwhile, the persistent
expansion in the labour force, driven by
demography, is forecast to imply a further
moderate increase in unemployment, which is set
to reach 11.3% in 2015 after 11.0% in 2013.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

After a low level in 2013 (1.0%), inflation is set to
slightly rise to 1.4% in 2014 on the back of the
increases in VAT rates entering into force in
January, before slowing to 1.3% in 2015.

Member States, France

Some uncertainties remain

Risks to the forecast are broadly balanced. A
stronger recovery could result from a quicker
effect of structural reforms on employment and
competitiveness. On the downside, a further
deterioration of firms' profit margins might
dampen export, investment and employment.
Towards a shift in the composition of fiscal
consolidation

In 2013, the general government deficit is forecast
to reach 4.1% of GDP, down from 4.8% in 2012.
The main reason for this is a significant package of
revenue measures (1½% of GDP). Expenditure
growth is projected to remain below historical
levels, with savings mainly stemming from central
government and social security funds (e.g. cuts in
the wage bill and other operating costs, a freeze on
transfers to local governments, savings on
healthcare expenses). However, GDP growth
significantly below potential and revenue
shortfalls, which may be due to unusually low tax
elasticity with respect to GDP, are having a
negative impact on the nominal deficit.

In 2014, the deficit is expected to improve further
on the back of the measures contained in the draft
budget. The composition of consolidation will
move towards expenditure savings; on top of
existing spending rules (central government and
healthcare), measures include new provisions on
how annual pension increases are linked to
inflation. However, public sector investment and
wage developments are expected to result in higher
expenditure growth compared with official plans.
The tax burden is forecast to stay unchanged.
Overall, the deficit is set to reach 3.8% of GDP.
These projections are consistent with a cumulated
improvement in the structural balance of 1¾% of
GDP in 2013-14.
Under the no-policy-change assumption, the
general government balance is set to somewhat
improve in 2015, reflecting higher recovery-driven
tax receipts partly offset by projected expenditure
developments.
The ratio of government debt to GDP, at 90% in
2012, will further increase on the back of still high
deficits relative to nominal GDP growth.

11. CROATIA
Fiscal challenges amidst weak growth outlook
From recession to stagnation

Real GDP is forecast to contract by 0.7% in 2013
on the back of weak demand in major export
markets, adverse labour market conditions, and a
debt overhang in the private sector.
Several specific factors, some of them linked to
EU accession, affected GDP components in the
first half of the year. Purchases in anticipation of
higher excises on EU entry had an upward impact
on private consumption. Moreover, imports
increased on the back of expected changes in the
system of excises and the effects of the common
EU foreign trade policy on the prices of some
imported goods. Exports also reacted: domestic
producers increased exports to trading partners
covered by the Central European Free Trade
Agreement (CEFTA) in anticipation of the change
in trade regime with these countries. Tourism
contributed positively to growth and investment
was boosted by outlays of some public companies.
Furthermore, the increase in registered turnover in
retail trade and restaurants after the introduction of
fiscal cash registers may have also affected the
consumption estimates.

investment. Legislative changes such as the law on
strategic investments and the availability of EU
funds are expected to underpin investment activity.
With some improvement in the labour market,
private consumption is expected to start recovering
in 2015. By contrast, on the external side exports
of goods are projected to recover only gradually
because of the small manufacturing base and the
weak economic outlook for the main trading
partners. Stronger domestic demand is forecast to
drive up imports, resulting in a slightly negative
net trade contribution to growth.

Going forward, some monthly indicators, notably
on industrial production and construction, suggest
that economic activity will remain weak. To some
extent, this will be offset by the successful touristic
season. Overall, the economy is expected to
stagnate in the second half of 2013.
Recovery towards the end of the forecast
period

While inflation is forecast to ease, weak nominal
wage growth and declining employment are
expected to weigh negatively on real disposable
household income and private consumption.
Fragile domestic demand and on-going bank
deleveraging, coupled with uncertainty, provide
little support for private investment which is
expected to return to positive territory only by the
end of 2014. Real GDP is nevertheless forecast to
increase slightly, by 0.5% in 2014, due to the
positive contribution of net exports and
investment.
In 2015, a modest recovery is expected on the back
of an upturn in domestic demand, notably

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

High unemployment, subdued inflation

Weak economic activity is set to result in a further
decline in employment in 2013, and stagnation in
2014, followed by modest gains in 2015 reflecting
the recovery in domestic demand. Hence, the
unemployment rate is expected to still rise in 2013,
and decline somewhat in 2014 and particularly in
2015.
In the absence of demand-side pressures, with
stable global energy prices and the effects of tax
measures further fading out, inflation is projected
to ease in both 2013 and 2014. A slight uptick in
inflation is expected in 2015, in line with the
recovery of domestic economic activity.
Risks remain tilted to the downside. Heightened
competitive pressures in the wake of EU accession
are already apparent in some sectors of the
economy, like retail trade, and it may take longer
to restore trade flows affected by the exit from the
CEFTA area. A further contraction in domestic
credit, especially to SMEs, may also pose a growth

Member States, Croatia

risk. Furthermore, the capacity to absorb EU funds
in the near-term may be more limited than
assumed in the forecast.
General government deficit widening

Revised figures validated by Eurostat show a
general government deficit of 6.4%, 7.8% and
5.0% of GDP in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Revisions
stem, among others, from the transfer of debt of
privatised shipyards to the government, impacting
especially 2011 with an increase of the deficit of
around 2% of GDP. At the end of 2012, the
debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 55.5% of GDP.
The deficit is expected to widen to 5.4% of GDP in
2013. On the revenue side, this reflects shortfalls
in corporate income tax, social contributions and
VAT receipts. Corporate income tax revenue in the
first three quarters of 2013 fell by almost one
quarter (year-on-year). This fall primarily reflects
the impact of the law on corporate profits,
allowing corporations as of 2013 to reduce their
taxable base by the amount of reinvested profits. In
addition, an EU accession-related change in the
date on which VAT on imported goods from EU
countries is due for payment resulted in a shift in

the time profile of VAT collection, implying a
one-off shortfall of some 0.5% of GDP in 2013.
On the other hand, measures like the reduction in
public sector wages and bonuses dampened the
trend in expenditure in 2013.
This forecast takes into account the fiscal and
economic policy guidelines released by the
Croatian government in late September 2013.
However, the set of possible additional measures,
released simultaneously, is not included, due to
lack of detailed information. The 2014 draft budget
bill was not available. Under this no-policy-change
assumption the deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio are
expected to deteriorate in 2014 and 2015, chiefly
due to increases in expenditure. On the revenue
side, the collection of indirect taxes is expected to
recover in 2014. The ratio of public debt to GDP is
forecast to continue to rise over the forecast period
to above 60% of GDP on the back of high deficits
and subdued nominal GDP growth. Risks to the
fiscal forecast seem skewed to the downside. If the
economy keeps performing poorly, there may be a
further activation of government guarantees to
state owned and public enterprises. Interest
expenditure may also increase more than foreseen,
also depending on liquidity conditions.

12. ITALY
From recession to a mild export-led recovery
After a further sharp contraction in 2012-13…

Against the background of persistently tight credit
conditions, domestic demand continues to act as a
major drag on growth and in 2013 economic
activity is projected to contract by 1.8%, after
-2.5% recorded in 2012. The downward revision to
the real GDP outlook compared to the -1.3%
expected in the spring forecast is mainly explained
by significantly lower investment, a less dynamic
external environment and a stronger exchange rate
appreciation. Available indicators suggest that the
recession may be close to bottoming out. Industrial
production declined in July and August, pointing
to a further moderate contraction in output in the
third quarter. However, improved business
confidence since the early summer, mainly driven
by a positive assessment of export orders, foretells
a gradual mild recovery in output as from the
fourth quarter of 2013.

External balance

…economic activity is set to gradually recover
in 2014-15.

In 2014, Italian banks are expected to continue
adjusting their balance sheets also in the
framework of the forthcoming asset quality review
and stress test related to the launch of the Single
Supervisory Mechanism. Therefore, credit
conditions are projected to ease only gradually,
while firms' liquidity is supported by the on-going
settlement of government trade debt arrears. On
the back of accelerating external demand, mainly
from extra-EU trade partners, capacity utilisation
of exporting firms is expected to increase,
fostering investment in equipment. This, together

68

with a more neutral fiscal stance, is set to turn the
economy to a mild expansion with real GDP
growth projected at 0.7% in 2014.
The current financial fragmentation in the euro
area is expected to recede over time, implying
more favourable credit conditions for households
and firms and a stronger recovery in 2015, at 1.2%.
This does not incorporate the benefits from the full
implementation of the adopted structural reforms,
as they could take more time to materialise. The
projected acceleration in domestic demand reverts
the negative reading in imports recorded over
2012-13, leading to a stabilisation of Italy's
current-account surplus at around 1% of GDP.
Employment lags
remains subdued

behind,

while

inflation

On the back of the deep and protracted recession,
headcount employment is set to continue falling
substantially in 2013, then stabilise in 2014 and
recover only in 2015. Combined with a modest rise
in the labour force, this brings the unemployment
rate at a peak of 12.4% in 2014. Over 2014-15,
productivity is set to recover as employment
dynamics lag the output recovery. Also as a result
of the projected moderate wage growth, unit labour
costs decelerate in 2013-15, broadly in line with
the rest of the euro area. However, the euro
appreciation weighs on price competitiveness.
HICP inflation is set to average 1.5% in 2013 and
remain fairly stable over the forecast horizon. In
the short run, the upward pressure on consumer
prices due to the 1 pp. increase in the standard
VAT rate as of October 2013 is expected to offset
the disinflationary effects stemming from weak
unit labour cost growth and subdued demand.
The budgetary correction slows down after the
large effort in 2012

In 2013, the general government deficit is forecast
to remain at 3.0% of GDP, including the full
budgetary execution of consolidation measures
enshrined in legislation. Interest expenditure is
anticipated to fall thanks to the recent decline in
the sovereign risk premium. After contracting over
2010-12, primary expenditure in nominal terms is
projected to increase by around 1% y-o-y due to
the settlement of trade debt arrears, which drives

Member States, Italy

up investment expenditure by 0.5% of GDP in
2013. By contrast, the wage bill and intermediate
consumption continue to be restrained. Revenues
are projected to rise marginally thanks to the good
performance of taxes on financial wealth and
corporate income, including some one-offs.

The structural balance is projected to improve
further in 2013 and 2014 – overall by around ¾%
of GDP – but to remain negative. On a
no-policy-change basis, the structural balance is
forecast to worsen in 2015.
Graph II.12.2: Italy - General government structural
balances

In 2014, the headline deficit is forecast at 2.7% of
GDP, after incorporating the draft budgetary plan
as adopted by the government on 15 October. The
primary surplus is expected to increase to 2.8% of
GDP and interest expenditure to rise marginally.
The increase in current primary expenditure is
projected to remain moderate thanks to a further
fall in the wage bill as public contracts remain
frozen and hiring is restricted. Capital spending is
set to recede as the investment expenditure related
to the settlement of trade debt arrears fades out.
Revenues are expected to grow less than nominal
GDP mainly due to expiring one-offs.
On a no-policy-change basis another slight fall in
the headline deficit is forecast in 2015, to 2.5% of
GDP. The primary surplus is set to rise further, to
3.1% of GDP, as revenues benefit from the
economic recovery.

13. CYPRUS
Recession deepens while adjustments are underway
Note: This forecast was finalised at end-July,
after the first quarterly review of the Economic
Adjustment programme, and will be revisited
during the second quarterly review. The text
reflects recent developments.
Resilient households curbed the contraction…

Economic activity continued its decline in the first
half of 2013, although to a lesser extent than
foreseen in the Spring 2013 European Economic
Forecast, as private consumption proved less weak
than
anticipated.
The
unwinding
of
macroeconomic imbalances, disruptions to credit
intermediation, and private sector deleveraging
continued to weigh on domestic demand.
Uncertainty about future business prospects led
firms to accelerate their destocking, weighing
further on growth. On the other hand, on the back
on a sharp contraction in import, net trade
contributed positively to growth.
Consumer confidence and business sentiment
indicators hit historically low levels following the
agreement of an economic adjustment programme
for Cyprus in April. Although some improvement
in the indicators has been observed since, they
continue to point to further contraction in activity
for the coming quarters.
… yet economic activity is expected to
contract in 2013 and 2014 …

Amid high uncertainty, real GDP in 2013 and 2014
is expected to profoundly contract, to broadly the
same extent cumulatively as expected in the Spring
Forecast. The Cypriot economy will continue to
face several headwinds. Domestic demand will
continue to fall, amid declining credit and wage
growth alongside further fiscal consolidation. On
the back of further shrinking of import in 2013-14,
a positive contribution to growth is expected from
net trade, and the current-account balance is
forecast to improve significantly.
…. but growth is set to resume in 2015

In 2015, the recession is expected to come to an
end and growth is foreseen to resume gradually, as
private domestic demand regains strength. The ongoing deleveraging of both households and
corporates will remove impediments to a more

70

balanced growth over time. At the same time, the
restoration of a sound and well-capitalised banking
sector is expected to gradually loosen the tight
credit conditions, supporting domestic demand.
The rebound in domestic demand is expected to
support imports, therefore limiting the positive
contribution of net export to GDP and negatively
impacting the current-account balance.
Unemployment rates reach historical high
levels while inflation remains weak

The profound contraction in economic activity in
2013 and 2014 is expected to weigh on
employment and push unemployment to
unprecedented levels. Subdued domestic cost
pressure and sizeable spare capacity are projected
to contain inflation in 2013 and 2014 despite
higher indirect taxes. As domestic demand picks
up in 2015, inflation is projected to accelerate,
albeit remaining below 2%.

Fiscal adjustments are underway

Despite the significant consolidation effort
undertaken in line with the programme
requirements, the general government deficit is
expected to increase in 2013. This is largely due to
a one-off compensation of provident and
retirement funds in Cyprus Popular Bank, which
amounts to 1.8% of GDP. The deficit is projected
to stay flat in 2014 and to decline in 2015, in line
with the annual targets set out in the context of the
programme.
Developments in 2014 are expected to be largely
driven by the continuation of the deep recession

Member States, Cyprus

and the sizeable consolidation measures
undertaken. This combination is likely to result in
a decrease of broadly the same magnitude of both
total revenue and total expenditure. On the revenue
side, falling wages and employment in the private
and public sectors as well as declining profits are
forecast to lower revenues from direct taxes, while
the measures undertaken to raise revenues from
indirect taxes are unlikely to be sufficient to
cushion the negative effect stemming from the
drop in private consumption and imports. On the
expenditure side, further restraint is expected from
measures to reduce the public sector wage bill,
continued compression in public investment,
intermediate consumption and other current
expenditure.
Overall,
expenditure-reducing
measures are projected to outweigh the increase in
social transfers connected to the adverse labour
market developments.
In 2015, total revenue is expected to recover in line
with the improving macroeconomic situation,
while total expenditure is projected to decrease

further on the back of better labour market
conditions.
Debt is expected to sharply increase in 2013,
mainly as a result of the participation of the
government in the recapitalisation of the banking
sector. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
further increase in 2014 and 2015, reflecting the
weak GDP growth.
Downside risks prevail

Risks are tilted to the downside. On the domestic
front, a more protracted period of disruptions to
efficient credit intermediation alongside tighter
credit supply conditions and a further deterioration
in the confidence in the banking sector could pose
considerable risks to the real economy. Moreover,
a further worsening of labour market conditions
may lead to a more prolonged weakness of
business and consumer confidence. On the fiscal
front, weaker-than-expected growth could lead to
revenue shortfalls.

Job creation lifts up consumer demand
Growth rate flattens out

Economic growth slowed to 4.1% y-o-y in the first
half of 2013 from a downward revised 5% in 2012.
At the same time, private consumption growth
accelerated to 6.2% from 5.8%, helped by
employment and real wage gains. The latest retail
trade indicators show that consumer demand is
slightly slowing but the growth momentum is set
to be sustained by increasing external demand over
the forecast horizon. All in all, economic growth is
now forecast to be relatively flat, rising only
marginally from 4% in 2013 to 4.2% in 2015 amid
broadly balanced risks.

In sharp contrast to consumer demand, investments
declined in the first half of 2013 as weak external
demand constrained corporate plans for capacity
upgrades. The recent upturn in economic sentiment
across Europe along with overall positive business
expectations linked to the upcoming euro adoption
at the beginning of 2014 are set to revive domestic
investment. Corporate profits are forecast to
remain the major source of investment as bank
deleveraging is still underway. On the supply side,
manufacturing is hit by the shutdown of the
country's largest metal processing plant with
further negative repercussions forecast for 2014.
Economic growth is supported by construction and
services in 2013, including a strong rebound in real
estate activities and a continuous expansion in
tourism. In 2014-15, growth is expected to be more
broad-based across major business sectors.
On the external side, the steep contraction in the
metal industry had broadly symmetric downward

72

effects on exports and imports. As the drop in
investment further dampened imports, the foreign
trade balance improved substantially in the first
half of 2013 and had an overall positive net
contribution to GDP growth. Imports are
nevertheless expected to pick up at a faster pace
than exports over the forecast horizon on the basis
of the projected rebound in investments.
Unemployment drops steeply

Despite the slowdown in economic growth,
unemployment dropped markedly to 13.0% in the
first quarter of 2013 and 11.4% in the second
quarter, relative to 16.3% in the corresponding
periods of the previous year. Employment grew
broadly in line with expectations by nearly 3%
y-o-y in the first half of 2013 but the labour force
unexpectedly contracted, most likely due to
statistical adjustments to the survey reflecting the
census in 2011. Unemployment is projected to
decrease at a slower pace over the forecast horizon
but is nevertheless likely to move below the EU
average already in 2014. As labour demand is
catching up with supply, wages are forecast to rise
strongly, also pushing up unit labour costs.
However, relative unit labour costs are seen as
broadly stable due to similar labour market
dynamics in major trading partners.
Energy market weighs heavily on inflation

Annual HICP inflation is projected at 0.3% in
2013, down from 2.3% in 2012. The steep
deceleration is largely linked to commodity prices,
in particular crude oil. Price cuts due to efficiency
upgrades in heating utilities as well as competitive
pressures on the telecom and retail markets also
played a role. The liberalisation of the electricity
market as of April 2014 will remove certain
limitations on household prices and is set to push
up inflation along with possible changes to the
feed-in tariff, network charges and market risks
stemming from higher wholesale prices. The
expected wage and employment growth is also
likely to lift core inflation while commodities are
assumed to have a further downward impact on
prices. Inflation is therefore forecast to reach 2.1%
in both 2014 and 2015, including a small one-off
effect (0.2 - 0.3 pp.) from the euro changeover in
2014 to cover rounding effects and some
administrative costs at corporate level.

Member States, Latvia

Low budget deficit and declining debt ratio

The general government deficit is estimated at
1.4% of GDP in 2013. While the results for the
first half of 2013 suggest that tax revenue remains
robust, the estimated outturn includes a guarantee
call of 0.3% of GDP, involving a metallurgical
company that is currently in a standstill.
The draft budget for 2014 was adopted by the
government on 1 October. As part of the budgetary
package, the government modified its earlier
strategy of lowering labour taxes: instead of the
previously planned reduction in the personal
income tax rate by 2 pps. in 2014 and again in
2015, the rate will be maintained at 24% in 2014
and reduced by 1 pp. in 2015 and again in 2016,
while the non-taxable thresholds (general and
applicable to dependents) will be increased from
2014, thus lowering the tax burden on low wages
and families. In parallel, the rate of social security
contributions will be lowered by 1 pp. to 34.1%
from 2014. To partially compensate the impact,
some consumption and natural resource taxes are
increased from 2014 and the respective tax bases
broadened. Furthermore, the draft 2014 budget
introduces a euro vignette and a tax on power

producers. The latter will be used to offset price
hikes from the full liberalisation of the electricity
market, including financial support to low income
families. Other important developments on the
expenditure side are broad-based growth in public
wages from 2014, including due to an increase in
the minimum wage, and a resumption of pension
indexation. The deficit is projected to remain
around 1% of GDP in both 2014 and 2015; the
latter projection is made on a no-policy-change
basis, including the tax measures taking effect
from 2015. This implies a slight deterioration in
the structural balance in both years. Risks to the
outlook are overall balanced, although the
metallurgical company mentioned above and
public companies remain sources of fiscal risk.
General government debt, which has increased
from its pre-crisis level of 9% of GDP to above
40% of GDP, is projected to start declining in 2014
and in particular in 2015, as large repayments
related to the international financial assistance
programme will be made. These will be financed
by accumulated assets and market borrowing,
resulting in a decline in the debt ratio to around
33% by the end of the forecast horizon.

15. LITHUANIA
Domestic demand set to drive growth
Return of confidence boosts domestic demand

Real GDP expanded by 3.7% in 2012, being
mainly driven by net exports. In 2013 domestic
demand has taken over and is set to remain the
principal growth engine going forward. Private
consumption has been boosted by growing wages,
slowing inflation, decreasing unemployment and
improved confidence. Likewise, investment
resumed growth on the back of improved
sentiment and last year's export expansion, which
pushed capacity utilisation above its historical
maximum.
Overall, Lithuania's real GDP is forecast to grow
by 3.4% in 2013, and accelerate to 3.6% in 2014
and 3.9% in 2015, with limited and balanced
domestic risks. External risks are tilted to the
downside as a further slowdown in Russia together
with reinforced border controls could have a
negative, yet limited, impact on trade.
Financial sector stable but credit growth
remains weak

Domestic credit has hardly grown in 2013 as the
private sector continued deleveraging and new
loans to the non-financial corporate sector only
picked up modestly. Although banks have
sufficient liquidity, it seems that lending
conditions, in particular to SMEs, construction and
real estate sectors, remain tight. At the same time a
majority of corporates relies on its own resources
to finance investment.
Steady growth ahead supported by robust
private consumption and still fragile investment

Looking ahead, private consumption growth is
expected to remain strong as disposable income of
households is set to keep growing with the
recovering labour market. However, employment
growth is set to slow down, as certain sectors face
increasing difficulties in hiring skilled workers.
Indeed, an outward shift of the Beveridge curve
points towards the existence of skill mismatches,
which is likely to drive wages upward in the
concerned sectors. This trend, together with low
inflation and expected increases in the public wage
bill, is set to result in real wage and consumption
increases over the forecast horizon.

74

Even though investment resumed growth as
expected, uncertainty remains around its
sustainability. Growth of gross fixed capital
formation in the first half of 2013 was reinforced
by one-off public investments, while private
investment growth was still limited. Nevertheless,
the necessary conditions for renewed investment
growth are in place. Recent high-frequency
indicators signal a sustained improvement in
domestic economic sentiment. Credit is projected
to grow by 3-5% over the forecast horizon, interest
rates remain at a historical low, and companies
have significant reserves to finance potential
investment. Public investment will continue to be
supported by EU co-financed projects, although its
share in GDP is likely to decrease.

Net export contribution set to turn negative

The bumper harvest had a significant positive
effect on export performance in 2012 and the first
half of 2013. However, export growth is expected
to slow significantly in the second half of this year
due to the high base, and pick up only in 2014 in
line with the improved external environment.
Conversely, imports are expected to keep growing
steadily due to the high import propensity of
consumption and investment. As a result, although
net exports supported growth until the second
quarter of 2013, their contribution is anticipated to
turn negative for the rest of the year. This trend is
expected to continue over the forecast horizon.
Current account was in surplus in the first half of
2013 but is expected to turn it into a slight deficit,
which is set to deepen moderately in 2014 and
2015.

Member States, Lithuania

Inflation moderated but is set to grow

Inflation (HICP) decreased to 3.2% in 2012 and is
set to slow down further to 1.4% in 2013,
reflecting weaker growth in food and energy
prices. The moderating trend is expected to reverse
this autumn due to the base effect, and inflation is
set to pick up further over the forecast horizon on
the back of accelerating inflation in the service
sector, which is sensitive to wage increases. As
food and energy inflation is set to remain
moderate, core inflation may be slightly higher
than the headline rate in 2014. Overall, HICP is
forecast to grow by 1.9% in 2014 and 2.4% in
2015.
Only limited progress in fiscal consolidation
despite favourable economic environment

Despite robust economic growth, the fiscal
position remains unchanged. The collection of
VAT and excise taxes fell short of government
estimates, mainly due to low inflation and weak
tax compliance. Dividends from state-owned
enterprises were lower than expected. Personal
income tax collection was modestly above plan,
while corporate income tax revenues outperformed
expectations. In addition, the deficit of the social

insurance fund SoDra was lower than expected,
reflecting improving labour market conditions.
Overall, revenues are set to be broadly on track
this year. However, additional expenditure
(payments to EU budget and agricultural subsidies)
and a partial unfreeze of public wages resulted in
an upward revision of general government deficit
by 0.1pp. to 3.0% of GDP. The deficit is forecast
to decrease to 2.5% of GDP in 2014 because of a
limited expenditure increase. Lower tax revenues
due to an increase in non-taxable allowance from
2014 will be only partially compensated by an
increase in excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco
products in spring 2014. For 2015 under a nopolicy-change assumption the general government
deficit is set to reach 1.9% of GDP.
As the constitutional court has ruled that previous
pension and public wage cuts should be
compensated, there is a fiscal risk as the exact
timing and amount of compensations has not yet
been decided. The structural deficit is estimated to
decrease from 3.1% of GDP in 2012 to 3% in
2013, 2.6% in 2014 and 2.2% in 2015. General
government debt is set to hover around 40% of
GDP (39.9% in 2013, 40.2% in 2014 and 39.6% in
2015).

Economic growth still depends on the financial sector
Growth to remain subdued

After a contraction in 2012 of both industrial
production and financial services, 2013 started
with positive signals from several high-frequency
indicators. But this did not materialise in positive
growth, as unfavourable weather conditions and a
prolonged weakness in the external environment
weighed on economic activity. Real GDP growth
declined by 0.6% (q-o-q) in the first quarter. In the
second quarter, freed from those hindering factors,
output increased by 1.6% (q-o-q). However, the
recovery remains fragile and is uneven across
sectors. Industrial output has stabilised but remains
well below its long-term average level. The
financial sector is adapting to a wave of new
regulations (such as FATCA, Basel III, or CRD
IV) and will need time to adjust and return to more
sustained growth rates. A closer look shows that
the slowdown has impacted more on
intermediation activity than on the investment
funds and insurance industry where activity
remains dynamic.

of capacity utilisation and still weak demand
prospects from the main trading partners are
putting a lid on firms’ investment plans. Exports
are expected to recover only gradually on the back
of still low industrial output while imports will be
affected by weak domestic demand. As a result,
the contribution from external trade to growth is
projected to turn positive. Overall, growth in 2013
is forecast at 1.9%, significantly higher than the
euro-area average.
Set for a slow recovery

Growth is projected to continue in 2014, although
at a slightly more moderate pace. Investment will
remain weak, on the back of still unfavourable
financial conditions and mainly led by purchases
from the aeronautic and satellite industry. In the
absence of new consolidation measures adopted by
the cut-off date, a mild recovery in private
consumption can be expected. The implementation
of the above-mentioned new regulations is
expected to have an impact on the profitability of
the financial sector, which has to adapt and
reorient its business, at least of some segments of
the industry. The contribution to growth from
external trade is set to slightly decline, as import
growth is projected to accelerate. For 2014 as a
whole, output is expected to grow by 1.8%.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

In the second half of 2013, economic activity is
expected to expand, but at a moderate pace. Both
the consolidation measures included in the budget
and the temporary agreement for wage growth
moderation are set to weigh somewhat on
households' disposable income. These modest
income gains coupled with rising unemployment
are projected to exert a dampening effect on
private consumption. The relief provided by lower
prices will not be sufficient to dodge a slowdown
in real private consumption. Tighter financial
conditions combined with a historically low level

76

In 2015, real GDP growth is projected to
decelerate to 1.1%. However, growth of economywide gross value added is expected to accelerate.
This is because, as of 1st January 2015, new VAT
rules regarding electronic services will enter into
force. According to these rules, the VAT revenues
generated from e-commerce activities will be
transferred from the country where the supplier is
located to that of the residence of the customer.
Higher confidence on the back of an improved
labour market is expected to support private
consumption.
Concerning financial sector
developments, the bulk of the transition to the new
rules should be completed by 2015 and, although
its potential to expand is expected to be smaller
than in the past, it is projected to remain a growth
driver.
The main downside risk to the growth forecast lies
precisely in the capacity of financial services to
remain the main growth driver in the Grand
Duchy.

Member States, Luxembourg

Lower inflation and moderate job creation

Government deficit on a rising path

In 2013 headline inflation is projected to decline to
1.8% y-o-y as the dampening effect on inflation
exerted by less dynamic oil prices is partially
offset by a rise in administered prices. Over the
forecast horizon, price dynamics are expected to
progressively abate to 1.6% in 2015, mostly due to
the absence of projected increases in administered
prices and lower oil prices. Core inflation is
projected to stall at 2.3% in 2013, but it will tend
to close the gap with headline inflation in 2014 and
2015.

The general government deficit is projected at
0.9% of GDP, up from 0.6% in 2012, thus
continuing a deteriorating trend in public finances
in spite of the implementation of the consolidation
package adopted by the government with the 2013
budget. Buoyant VAT revenues from e-commerce
related activities have been partially offset by a
shortfall in corporation taxes. At the same time,
government
consumption expenditure has
continued to rise very fast. In 2014, under the
usual no-policy-change assumption the deficit is
expected to increase to 1.0% of GDP, as
government expenditure is projected to grow faster
than revenues. In 2015 the deficit will increase to
2.7% of GDP as VAT revenues from e-commerce
will start to fade away. The initial impact is
estimated at 1.4% of GDP. The surplus in the
structural balance is expected to decline from ¾%
of GDP in 2012 to ¼% in 2013. It is then projected
to turn to a deficit of ½% of GDP in 2014 and to
further deteriorate in 2015.

Job creation is expected to weaken in 2013,
increasing by 1.7% after 2.3% in 2012. Most of the
new jobs created in the first part of 2013 were in
sheltered sectors, a sign of the weakening
underlying trend, while labour shedding continued
in the remaining sectors of the economy.
Employment growth should bottom out in 2014 at
1.5%, to accelerate again in 2015 to 1.7%. In view
of low employment growth coupled with an
expanding active population, the unemployment
rate is expected to increase throughout the forecast
horizon, from 5.7% in 2013 to 6.5% in 2015.

Government debt is expected to rise to almost 29%
in 2015.

17. HUNGARY
A gradual recovery ahead
A gradual recovery partly on account of
indirect fiscal stimulus measures

After a short pick-up in 2010-11, the economy
entered into recession in 2012. The first quarters of
2013 brought a turnaround in economic activity,
mostly in agriculture, but other sectors of the
economy have also recovered. This is forecast to
continue in the next quarters; therefore a mild real
GDP growth rate of 0.7% is foreseen for 2013.
Exports are projected to speed up partly on account
of improving external demand, but also due to
increasing market share linked to new production
capacity in the machinery sector. Domestic
demand is expected to be the main driver of
growth. An increase in real disposable income,
partly due to regulated price cuts, puts private
consumption growth in positive territory, although
high unemployment and ongoing deleveraging are
projected to keep spending contained. The sharp
fall in investment is forecast to stop on account of
a strong increase in government investment,
primarily driven by an increased absorption of EU
funds. The change in private investment remains
negative, reflecting the continued fall in lending
and a weak housing market.
Real GDP growth is expected to reach 1.8% and
2.1% in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Exports are
forecast to gain impetus in tandem with improving
external demand. Improvement in domestic
demand is again helped by some quasi-fiscal
measures. Private investment is projected to turn
positive primarily on account of the central bank's
extended Funding for Growth Scheme (providing
subsidized lending to SMEs). A strengthening of
household consumption is expected to stem from a
further improvement in real disposable income,
partly linked to regulated price cuts and increasing
public sector wages, as well as looser lending
conditions.
Risks are broadly balanced: looser-than-expected
financial conditions might improve the GDP
outlook, but weak economic confidence might
imply lower growth
Resilient employment mainly due to subsidised
job creation in the public sector

Despite a weak economy, national employment
expanded by more than 1% in the first half of 2013

78

on a year-on-year basis. However, employment
gains are still mainly occurring in the public
sector, due to extensions of the Public Work
Scheme and on account of the increasing number
of Hungarian frontier workers. Meanwhile,
employment in the domestic private sector is
broadly stagnating. Companies are adjusting by
containing wages, lowering average hours worked
and to a smaller extent by laying off employees, to
counterbalance the deterioration in profitability in
2012. Thus, a slight decline in domestic private
sector employment is expected in 2013, followed
by moderate growth in the outer years. Although
the unemployment rate has been decreasing, it is
projected to remain at two-digit levels in 2014 and
2015 due to increasing participation and moderate
employment growth.
Historically low inflation

Inflation has fallen to a historically low rate of
1.6% by the third quarter of 2013. This decline has
occurred mostly on account of two waves of cuts
in regulated energy and other utility prices
introduced as of January and August, and the
decision on a further cut in November is already
adopted. Still, underlying inflation has been
declining too, due to the negative output gap, a
drop in imported inflation and decreasing
expectations. Price increases are also expected to
remain moderate throughout the forecast horizon
due to a negative output gap.
General government deficit expected
increase again to around 3% of GDP

to

In 2013 the general government deficit is expected
to increase to 2.9% of GDP.(23) Compared to the
budgeted figures, the forecast factors in lower tax
revenues of 1% of GDP, after including the impact
of the June 2013 tax-increasing measures of 0.4%
of GDP. In addition, even after the implementation
of expenditure cuts of 0.3% of GDP adopted in
May, higher expenditure of close to 1% of GDP
are expected compared to the budget. These
developments have been less than fully offset by
the budgetary reserves buffer of 1.6% of GDP and
by higher revenues from the sale of broadcasting
(23)

The forecast assumes that the planned capital injections of
0.3% of GDP in the integration body of the savings
cooperatives will be recorded as financial transactions;
however, this is subject to confirmation by Eurostat.

Member States, Hungary

frequencies of 0.2% of GDP. The deficit forecast
thus slightly exceeds the target of 2.7% of GDP.
Based on the draft budget bill, the 2014 deficit is
projected to be 3.0% of GDP, i.e. slightly higher
than the recently revised target of 2.9% of GDP.
The higher deficit in 2014 compared to 2013
reflects the planned increase of wages in the public
education sector, the increasing fiscal costs of the
previously introduced simplified business taxes as
well as the extension of the family tax allowances.
These elements are forecast to be partly offset by a
nominal freeze of public wages in most areas of
public sectors, additional revenues from the new
distance-based road toll system, the enhancement
of the tax administration and the effect of
economic
recovery.
In
addition,
the
implementation of specific investment projects is
announced to be conditional on the realisation of
one-off
revenues
from
the
sale
of
telecommunication licences. The forecast is based
on the important assumption that the totality of the
extraordinary reserve (0.3% of GDP) and part of
the general reserve (i.e. close to 0.1% of GDP) will
not be spent.

In 2015, based on the usual no-policy-change
assumption and the Convergence Programme, the
deficit is projected to decrease to 2.7% of GDP,
also on account of an assumed drop of public
investment linked to the electoral cycle.
The forecast is subject to significant deficitincreasing risks. As usual, the forecast does not
incorporate measures which are not yet decided or
specified in sufficient detail. Such possible
measures include a VAT rate cut for unprocessed
meat, the extension of family benefits and a new
programme to support foreign-exchange-indebted
households. Further forecast uncertainties are
related to accounting issues pertaining to the
change from public to total cost for the calculation
of the national co-financing as well as the
budgetary impact of the introduction of online cash
registers.
The structural balance is forecast to deteriorate in
2013 and 2014 by around 1½% of GDP in
cumulative terms and, on a no-policy-change basis,
to improve slightly in 2015. Government debt is
forecast to increase to close to 81% of GDP in
2013, before decreasing by around a cumulative
1½ pps. in 2014 and 2015.

18. MALTA
The wind in the sails gains strength
Economic growth speeds up in 2013

Despite weaker-than-expected domestic demand,
real GDP surprised positively and grew by 2.8% in
the first half of 2013, driven by higher net exports
as imports contracted more than exports. A
significant contribution came also from the change
in inventories. As overall economic sentiment
dipped in the third quarter, economic growth is
projected to slow down in the second half of the
year. Still, real GDP is forecast to grow by 1.8% in
2013 as a whole, up from 0.8% in 2012.
Household consumption is expected to be the
main driver of growth in 2014-15

Real GDP growth is projected to accelerate
marginally and to average 2% in 2014-15. The
delayed recovery in domestic demand registered in
2013 is forecast to gain pace over the forecast
horizon. Rising disposable income, also thanks to
tax incentives, is projected to support private
consumption, which is forecast to become the main
driver of economic growth, adding on average
1.2 pps. in 2014-15. At the same time, investment
is projected to remain subdued and to increase only
slightly from its currently low level. Difficult
access to finance, due to a combination of high
cost and tight lending standards, and restructuring
of the economy towards less capital-intensive
activities are seen to be the main factors behind the
weak investment outlook.
Export growth is projected to pick up in line with
the gradually recovering economic outlook in the
euro area and the further expansion of the
economy into export-oriented service activities. At
the same time, recovery in the very importintensive domestic demand will stimulate import
growth, hence the contribution from net exports to
GDP growth is projected to narrow, while
remaining positive over the forecast horizon. Thus,
the current account balance is forecast to decrease
from its peak in 2012 but to remain positive.
The risks to this macroeconomic forecast are on
the upside in 2013, if the positive momentum from
the first two quarters is carried over, and broadly
balanced thereafter. Given the very high trade
openness of the Maltese economy, slower recovery
in the main trading partners could further delay the
fragile recovery in domestic demand. At the same

80

time, a number of structural reforms, most notably
in the energy sector, are likely to drive down
industry costs if properly and timely implemented,
and strengthen the medium-term growth outlook.
Employment growth remains strong, while HICP
inflation gradually strengthens

Job creation surprised positively in the first half of
the year thanks to the tourist sector and the newlyemerging, labour-intensive activities in the
services sector. These developments have been
also supported by ongoing government measures
to increase labour market participation of women.
Employment growth is projected to moderate
slightly over the forecast horizon, but to remain
relatively strong at 1.8% per annum, well above
the euro-area average. At the same time, the
unemployment rate is projected to remain low and
to average 6.3%, slightly lower than in 2012.
HICP inflation decelerated significantly in 2013
mainly as a result of decreasing prices in
restaurants and hotels. Inflationary pressures are
expected to strengthen gradually over the forecast
horizon and thus price growth is projected to
average 2% in 2014-15, higher than the euro-area
average. The acceleration is projected to come
predominantly from the services sector, where
inflation would pick up in line with the assumed
recovery in domestic demand. This forecast does
not take into account the government plans to
lower electricity tariffs in 2014, which could result
in lower inflation.
Deficit to increase marginally

After having widened to 3.3% of GDP in 2012, on
account of slippages in current expenditure, the
deficit in 2013 is expected to increase slightly to
3.4% of GDP. Current primary expenditure is
forecast to increase by 0.3 pp. of GDP, due to
higher subsidies and other current expenditure,
while intermediate consumption is projected to
decrease by 0.1 pp. of GDP thanks to the spending
review at ministry level started in July 2013. On
the capital side, net expenditure, including the
planned additional equity injection into Air Malta
(0.6% of GDP), is expected to stabilise. Despite
the pick-up in economic activity, indirect taxes are
projected to decrease by 0.1 pp. of GDP as the
2012 outcome benefitted from one-off revenues.

Member States, Malta

Income taxes are projected to continue growing,
despite measures to gradually reduce the overall
income tax levels, on the back of both improved
corporate profitability as well as a favourable
labour market outlook. As a result, current
revenues are projected to rise by 0.3 pp. of GDP.
In the absence of consolidation measures, as the
2014 budget was not adopted by the government
before the cut-off date of this forecast, the deficit
ratio in 2014 is expected to stay unchanged. The
current revenue ratio is projected to stabilise, while
primary current expenditure is forecast to drop by
0.2 pp. of GDP, reflecting a continuation of the
tight recruitment policy in the public sector as well
as less dynamic social transfers thanks to the
gradual impact of the 2006 pension reform. Net
capital expenditure is expected to grow by 0.1 pp.
of GDP, also due to a lower equity injection into
Air Malta. In 2015, the deficit is projected to
increase marginally by 0.1 pp. of GDP, on account
of higher net capital expenditure.

structural deficit is expected to deteriorate by
½ pp. of GDP in 2015, as the headline deficit does
not improve in a context of actual GDP growth
exceeding its potential. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to continue increasing over the forecast
horizon, as the primary balance remains
insufficient to allow a reduction in the debt ratio.
The main risk is related to the financial situation of
Enemalta (the public energy utility corporation),
which could entail additional subsidies.

19. THE NETHERLANDS
Muted recovery in sight after two years of negative growth
2013: a transition year

With the exception of the second quarter of 2012,
the Dutch economy has been contracting since the
second quarter of 2011. The continued positive
contribution of net exports to economic growth has
been outweighed by depressed domestic demand.
Domestic demand is expected to remain weak in
the remainder of 2013, as budget consolidation,
pension cuts and negative wealth effects,
predominantly emanating from the housing
market, continue to pose a drag on the economy.
The resulting negative real disposable income
developments coupled with deleveraging pressures
weigh on Dutch economic performance quite
significantly, despite a positive contribution from
net exports.

trends in real disposable income and the labour
market. In addition, household savings are unable
to cushion the negative impact on private
consumption due to on-going balance sheet
adjustments. The household debt-to-GDP ratio
decreased in 2012 and is forecast to decline even
further. Continued household deleveraging is
forecast to dampen internal demand.

Following a contraction in real GDP in 2012, a
further fall by 1% is expected in 2013. However,
going forward, the quarter-on-quarter GDP growth
is set to gradually move out of negative territory
and to remain positive over the forecast horizon.
The fragile transition towards higher growth is
projected to stem initially from supportive trade
developments with private consumption in
particular lagging behind. Consumer confidence,
whilst showing a slight improvement in recent
months, remains markedly below the long-term
average, underlining the weakness of consumption.
Domestic demand set to strengthen over the
forecast horizon

While for 2014 domestic demand growth is still
expected to be negative, a gradual pick up is set to
take place in the course of the year. Investment is
forecast to grow steadily on the back of a recovery
in production and profitability. The strong rises in
the capacity utilisation rate in August and
September 2013, coupled with improved producer
confidence provide early signals in this regard. At
the same time, tightened financing conditions may
hamper credit supply, in particular for SMEs,
holding back investment.

Net exports

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

In 2014, net exports remain the main driver of
economic growth, in line with improved
international trade prospects. In 2015, domestic
demand is projected to rebound, leading to a more
balanced contribution of domestic and external
demand to growth. In particular, private
consumption is expected to recover substantially
reflecting rising disposable income, partly due to
lower pension contributions associated with
reforms to the second pension pillar.
Risks to the macroeconomic scenario stemming
from domestic developments are predominantly on
the downside. If uncertainties regarding the
implementation and effects of foreseen measures
in areas such as pensions and the labour market
materialise, this may hamper the recovery of
domestic demand. On the other hand, a faster and
more pronounced stabilisation of the housing
market could provide an additional boost.
Increasing unemployment, easing inflation

Conversely, private consumption is forecast to
remain weak, albeit less markedly than in previous
years, and to pick up only later. In 2014, the
positive effects of a stabilisation in the housing
market transactions would not suffice to offset the

82

Unemployment rose sharply in the beginning of
2013 as a result of declining employment and the
increase in labour supply which stems from
attempts to cover for household income losses.

Member States, The Netherlands

Whilst
the
rise
in
seasonally-adjusted
unemployment has moderated over the summer
months, the fragile economic outlook and a further
rise in labour supply still imply a continued rise in
the unemployment rate from around 7% in 2013 to
8% in 2014. In 2015, in line with improved
cyclical prospects and the employment response
lags, the unemployment rate is forecast to ease
slightly.
In 2012 and the first three quarters of 2013, HICP
inflation stood close to 3%, pushed up by increases
in energy prices and discretionary tax measures,
notably the higher VAT rate as of October 2012.
As these upward effects are likely to drop out of
the figures as from late-2013 and in view of weak
domestic demand, inflation is expected to ease to
below 2% in both 2014 and 2015.
Deficit only slowly decreasing

In 2013, the general government deficit is expected
to fall to 3.3% of GDP, from 4.1% in 2012. In
2013, the headline deficit is significantly
influenced by one-offs, notably the sale of mobile
telephony licenses (around 0.6% of GDP). The

nationalisation of SNS Reaal is assumed to have
only a limited impact on the deficit in 2013 (0.1%
of GDP), in line with the estimates of Statistics
Netherlands and pending a final decision on
classification by Eurostat. In 2014, weak economic
activity but also the fact that these one-offs fall
out, imply that despite an additional consolidation
package of around 1% of GDP ex ante the deficit
would remain above 3% of GDP in 2014. On the
back of further planned consolidation efforts and
the expected improvement in economic activity,
the deficit is forecast at around 3% of GDP in
2015. The structural balance is expected to
improve by around ½% in both 2013 and 2014 and
to remain broadly stable in 2015.
The gross government debt-to-GDP ratio increased
from 65.7% of GDP in 2011 to 71.3% in 2012 and
is expected to increase further over the forecast
period to around 77% in 2015.
The risks to the fiscal forecast are mainly on the
downside. They partly stem from uncertainties
related to the macroeconomic forecast, but there is
also uncertainty concerning the collection of
revenue from some of the fiscal measures in 2014.

20. AUSTRIA
Signs of recovery amid uncertainty
Domestic demand has lost momentum...

The Austrian economy stagnated in the first half of
2013. Investment declined further by an average of
1% quarter on quarter. Private consumption
growth remained slightly negative as in the second
half of 2012. Export growth was subdued, but
slumping imports prevented the recession of late
2012 from persisting.
Signs of a recovery are still difficult to detect in
the data available for the third quarter of this year.
On the whole, business and consumer sentiment
has improved compared to late last year, however
falling short of a clear upswing. Manufacturing
orders have been recovering since the first quarter,
but production backlogs remain thin. Capacity
utilisation is still on a subsiding trend.

…But brightening sentiment is expected to start
bearing fruit

The projections for the remainder of 2013 and the
following two years assume a consolidation of
business and consumer confidence and a gradual
reversal of the decline in investment and
consumption. Taking into account the weak
dynamics in the previous quarters, GDP growth
will likely come to less than 0.5% in 2013. For
2014 and 2015, growth is projected to regain some
momentum and exceed 1.5%, driven by a
strengthening of domestic demand. Net exports are
expected to contribute positively to growth on the
back of higher export growth, but to a smaller
extent than domestic demand due to a rebound in
imports.

84

In the environment of perceived uncertainty,
slowing foreign and stagnating domestic demand
that characterised 2012 and early 2013,
corporations seem to have put investment plans on
hold, as manifested by four consecutive quarters of
declining investment. With confidence taking time
to rebuild, only a gradual reversal of the
investment slump is likely for this year, despite
low interest rates and solid corporate liquidity.
Credit growth is expected to remain subdued both
on account of weak demand and deleveraging
needs in the banking system.
The exporting sectors are forecast to benefit from
progressively
improving
external
demand
conditions over the forecast horizon. Capitalising
on non-cost competitiveness factors, exports of
services have experienced an increase in market
shares in 2013. Manufacturing productivity has
been dented but wage growth has stayed moderate.
Unit labour costs have thus increased in line with
those of the trading partners, leaving cost
competitiveness seemingly unimpaired. All in all,
the external balance is projected to stay positive
and to provide a positive contribution to growth.
Dynamics of prices and wages to remain
contained

Employment growth eased in the first half of 2013
reflecting stagnating output, but is expected to
strengthen somewhat in 2014-15. However, the
increase in the labour force will likely preclude a
sizeable decline in the unemployment rate in the
coming years.
Nominal wage growth hardly exceeded inflation in
the latest quarters. The wage settlements
applicable for the coming years are likely to turn
out far more moderate than this year. However,
with inflation easing over the forecast horizon and
employment strengthening, real wage growth is
projected to support a moderate increase in
consumption.
Consumer price inflation is forecast to slow to
2.2% in 2013 due to easing food and energy price
pressure. Inflationary pressures are expected to
dissipate further in the course of 2014-15 with
inflation moving below 2%. Core inflation is also
expected to remain in check thanks to moderate
wage growth and domestic demand.

Member States, Austria

Fiscal consolidation slows
financial sector support

down

due

to

After two years of better-than-expected general
government balances, in 2013 the government
deficit is estimated to remain unchanged compared
to 2012. The deceleration in the consolidation path
is mainly due to higher support to the banking
group Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA) in the
framework of the new restructuring plan approved
by the European Commission in September. The
negative effect of the additional capital transfers to
HGAA is likely to be partly offset by higher
federal revenue and a better outcome expected in
subnational budget balances. The robust dynamics
of the household income tax and better than
expected revenue from the tax agreement with
Switzerland and from the sale of telephonic
licenses constitute the main sources of additional
revenue.
While the positive impact of the discretionary
revenue measures approved with the 2012 Stability
Package will largely fade out in 2014, the
implementation of the planned saving in the
pension system and health sector are assumed to
contribute to public finances consolidation by

more than 0.3% of GDP in 2014. The expected
slowdown in expenditure growth coupled with the
projected acceleration of economic activity will
help to offset the preliminary estimations over the
impact of the further support required by HGAA.
The latter is projected to take place during the
forecast horizon, although the exact quantification
of the recapitalisation costs is still uncertain. An
increase in the size of the required government
support represents the main downside risk to the
forecast scenario, which points to a deficit
narrowing to 1.9% in 2014.
The continuing effect of planned saving on health
and pensions coupled with higher GDP growth is
expected to lead to a further reduction in the
general government deficit in 2015. The structural
deficit is estimated to remain broadly unchanged in
2012-14 while in 2015 it is estimated to decline by
0.3 pp. Following upward revisions in the 2012
debt figure, government debt is expected to
increase further in 2013 to 74.8% of GDP. This is
higher than estimated in the spring forecast due to
a larger 2013 deficit and upward revisions in last
year debt stock. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to start decreasing from 2014 onwards due to
lower deficit and higher GDP growth.

GDP growth rebounds but fiscal situation deteriorates
Economic activity rebounds in the second
quarter of 2013

Following three consecutive quarters of subdued
growth, in the first quarter of 2013 real GDP grew
by a mere 0.2% q-o-q, before rebounding to 0.4%
q-o-q in the second one. The contraction of
domestic demand, in particular of inventories,
acted as the drag on growth in the first half of the
year. Private consumption growth was lacklustre
amid tumbling consumer confidence, increasing
unemployment and subdued wage growth while
gross fixed capital formation contracted under the
impact of fiscal consolidation that curbed public
investment. Net exports were the growth engine, as
imports contracted amid falling domestic demand
while exports increased by over 5% y-o-y.

expected to gain strength in 2014-15 as economic
conditions brighten further. Public investment
growth is projected to be strongly negative
throughout 2013, also because less infrastructure
projects financed from the previous EU financial
perspective are expected to be completed
compared to the previous year, and to stabilise in
the outer years of the projection

Economic activity gradually picks up as
domestic demand gathers steam

Improving consumer and business confidence and
flattening unemployment suggest that private
consumption and investment are regaining strength
in the second half of the year, adding to the
projected acceleration in economic activity.
Overall, real GDP is forecast to increase by 1.3%
in 2013. Economic activity is set to gradually gain
steam over the forecast horizon, when the global
economic outlook improves further translating into
a pick-up in private investments and a moderate
increase in employment. Real GDP growth is
expected to reach 2.5% and 2.9% in 2014 and
2015 respectively, with domestic demand
projected to gradually replace external trade as the
main growth engine.
Private consumption is set to grow against the
background of higher real wages as a result of
contained inflationary pressures, falling costs of
debt servicing and an improvement in labour
market conditions expected in the outer years of
the forecast horizon. The rate of increase is,
however, forecast to remain below long-term
averages as consumers are expected to rebuild
savings from the very low level recorded in 2012.
Private gross fixed capital formation is set to
increase slightly in the second half of 2013 as the
nascent rebound in global demand amid high
capacity utilisation and lower financing costs
encourages corporates to invest. This process is

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Foreign trade is set to support growth over the
whole forecast horizon but at a diminishing scale.
In 2013, the effect is expected to be particularly
strong as Polish exporters increasingly expand
their sales into non-EU markets, while import
growth lags behind. In 2014-15, imports are set to
catch up on the back of higher private domestic
demand. The current-account deficit is projected to
improve considerably from 3.3% of GDP in 2012
to around 1½% of GDP in 2013 and remain at this
level over the forecast horizon, reflecting
improvement in the trade balance.
This scenario is subject to broadly balanced risks.
On the upside, a weaker currency would further
boost exports and enhance import substitution. On
the downside, a pick-up in inflation might dent real
incomes and lead to lower private consumption.
Inflation remains contained over the forecast
horizon

HICP inflation reached 3.7% in 2012, as a result of
the zloty depreciation, high commodity prices and
increases in administered prices. The inflation rate
is expected to drop to 1% in 2013 due to declining
commodity and gas prices as well as weak

domestic demand. A moderate pick-up to 2% and
further to 2.2% is forecast in 2014 and 2015 as a
result of negative base effects in the first half of
2014 and improving domestic demand over the
forecast horizon.
Fiscal situation deteriorates

From 3.9% of GDP in 2012, the deficit is foreseen
to increase to 4.8% of GDP in 2013, due to a
revenue shortage, mainly as a result of declining
indirect and direct tax revenues. In August, the
authorities amended the 2013 state budget, which
included expenditure cuts of 0.5% of GDP.
However, general government expenditure in 2013
is set to fall only slightly compared to the spring
forecast, with an increase in current expenditures
partially offsetting a fall in capital expenditures.
In 2014 and 2015, the fiscal strategy is largely
based on the planned pension reform. In 2014, the
general government balance is projected to turn
into a surplus of 4.6%. This is mainly due to a oneoff transfer of assets from the second pillar of the
pension system (8.5% GDP), which under the rules
in force until next year (ESA-95) is treated as
revenue. The main permanent measures on the

revenue side with a positive effect on the fiscal
balance include the increased social contributions
due to the planned pension reform, increases in
excise duties as well as a continuing freeze of
Personal Income Tax thresholds. The main
structural measures resulting in expenditure
savings are the lower debt-financing costs due to
the asset transfer from the second pension pillar, a
wage freeze of central government employees as
well as the gradual increase in retirement age.
These savings will be partially offset by increased
expenditure on the extension of maternity leave. In
2015, the general government balance is expected
to turn back into a deficit of 3.3%, due to the oneoff nature of the large improvement in 2014.
The structural deficit is set to deteriorate in 2013 to
4% of GDP before gradually improving to 2.7% of
GDP in 2015. General government debt-to-GDP
ratio is forecast to fall from 55.6% in 2012 to 51%
in 2014, mainly as an effect of the announced
transfer of pension funds' assets of 8.5% of GDP,
before edging up to 52.5% in 2015. The projected
debt figures are however subject to considerable
uncertainty due to high exchange-rate volatility
affecting the debt valuation.

in

the

economic

Real GDP growth in the second quarter surprised
on the upside, increasing by 1.1% q-o-q. GDP
growth was primarily driven by domestic demand
while the growth contribution of net exports fell as
strong export growth was partly offset by fast
growing imports. While recent short-term
indicators are consistent with the projected
turnaround of economic activity towards the end of
the year, the acceleration of GDP in the second
quarter was to a large extent driven by one-off
factors. As a result, the macroeconomic outlook
for 2013 and 2014 has been slightly revised
upward compared with the spring 2013 projection,
largely reflecting the mechanical impact of the
better-than-expected second quarter growth on the
annual average growth rates. Real GDP is now
forecast to contract by 1.8% in 2013 and to expand
by 0.8% in 2014. Net exports are expected to
remain the main growth drivers while the growth
contribution of domestic demand is forecast to turn
positive in 2014. Real GDP growth is projected to
reach 1.5% in 2015, with a broadly balanced
contribution from external trade and domestic
demand.
The situation in the labour market has stabilised in
line with economic activity. However, tourism and
agriculture were the main contributing sectors to
the employment expansion in the second quarter of
this year, raising questions regarding its durability.
Employment is still forecast to contract by some
4% in 2013 and by another ½% in 2014 before
starting to grow by around ½% in 2015. The
unemployment rate started to decline in the second
quarter of 2013 on the back of the recovery in
employment but also due to a decline in labour
market participation. The unemployment rate is
now projected to average 17.4% in 2013, to peak
at 17.7% in 2014 and to drop back to 17.3% in
2015.
Steady adjustment in external imbalances

Economic rebalancing towards the tradable sectors
continues at a fast pace. Exports have been
booming since the beginning of the year with a
broad-based contribution of various production
sectors and significant gains in shares in both
goods and services export markets. At the same

88

time, import growth is expected to decelerate in
the short term as the strong increase in the second
quarter reflects largely one-off factors. Over the
forecast horizon, export growth is forecast to
remain robust on the back of the recovery in
Portugal's export markets while imports should
pick up progressively in line with final demand.
The current-account balance is now forecast to
reach a surplus of close to 1% of GDP this year,
upward revised from 0.1% of GDP in the spring
2013 forecast, and is expected to remain broadly
constant over the forecast period.
Inflation is decelerating

With HICP inflation remaining significantly below
the euro-area rate in the first half of this year, the
annual average inflation is forecast at 0.6% this
year, 1% in 2014 and 1.2% in 2015. In 2013, the
re-instatement of two monthly bonus payments in
public-sector wages has a discernible effect on
total economy labour costs and is expected to
impact also on the GDP deflator in this year.

Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are tilted
to the downside in 2014 and 2015

High frequency indicators suggest slight upward
risks to the headline growth forecast for 2013.
However, the sustainability of the projected
recovery in 2014-15 is contingent on positive trade
and financial market developments, which remain
fragile. The ability of Portugal to progressively
regain access to the sovereign-bond market at
more favourable interest rates remains a key
forecast assumption. In addition, household and
corporate deleveraging pressures could weigh

Member States, Portugal

stronger on private consumption and investment
than is currently assumed.

these will be drawn from the public expenditure
review (PER) with the main budgetary impact
stemming from the reduction of the public sector
wage bill, a comprehensive pension reform and
sectoral expenditure cuts across line ministries and
programmes. The remaining effort will be
achieved through smaller-scale measures worth
0.4% of GDP, including some one-off operations.
Most of the measures are defined in the 2014 draft
Budget Law. The 2015 forecast is supported by
measures worth slightly above 1% of GDP, mostly
on the expenditure side.

Fiscal outlook

The general government deficit is expected to
reach 5.5% of GDP in 2013, excluding a one-off
capital injection into BANIF bank worth 0.4% of
GDP. In spite of solid tax revenue performance
and careful budget execution, a shortfall of 0.5%
of GDP has been identified after the use of the
budget reserves. The 2013 projection therefore
accounts for corrective measures currently being
implemented such as the reduction of available
funds for investment and tighter control over
intermediate consumption of line ministries. In
addition, the government has announced a one-off
"tax and social security contributions debt
recovery scheme" with an expected yield of 0.4%
of GDP.

Downside risks to the budget outlook are mostly of
legal nature as some measures of the 2014 budget
will be scrutinised by the Portuguese
Constitutional Court. In contrast, macroeconomic
risks to the budgetary outlook seem to be balanced,
in particular in the short run.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak slightly
below 128% in 2013 and to decline thereafter. The
upward revision with respect to the spring forecast
is explained by a statistical correction of the 2012
debt data, the non-realisation of some short-term
debt reducing operations and higher cash holdings.

The fiscal balance is expected to reach -4.0% of
GDP in 2014 and -2.5% in 2015. The fiscal
projections for 2014 are underpinned by
consolidation measures worth about 2.3% of GDP,
mostly permanent expenditure reductions. Most of

23. ROMANIA
Strong exports and weak domestic demand drive current-account
adjustment in 2013
Buoyant economic activity in 2013

In the first half of 2013, real GDP increased by
1.8% y-o-y. Activity was mainly driven by a stellar
export performance of 11.9% y-o-y in real terms
on account of a robust automotive industry. These
positive developments, however, mask weak
domestic demand, with consumption being flat and
investment contracting in the first part of 2013.
Growth is projected to accelerate in second half of
2013 thanks to a significant impact of the good
harvest (especially in the third quarter of 2013) and
a marginal recovery in domestic demand. These
trends are expected to result in an annual growth of
2.2% in 2013. The current-account deficit is
forecast to decline to 1.2% of GDP in 2013,
mainly due to a much lower trade deficit.
Growth drivers to gradually switch from net
exports to domestic demand

Real GDP growth is forecast to continue at 2.1% in
2014 and to accelerate to 2.4% in 2015. Growth is
projected to be slightly above potential over the
forecast horizon reflecting the payoff of the
product and labour market reforms as well as the
improving global economic activity. Growth
drivers are expected to gradually switch from net
exports in 2013 to domestic demand in 2014.
Investment is projected to regain momentum
supported by a better absorption of EU funds as
major infrastructure projects are expected to gain
traction. Although constrained by the continuing
needs for repairing households' balance sheets,(24)
private consumption is expected to pick up on the
back for improving consumer confidence and
increasing real disposable income as employment
grows and inflation remains moderate. Public
consumption is forecast to continue to be
constrained by the need for further, albeit more
gradual, fiscal consolidation.
Although the external environment is expected to
improve and thus to support continued export
growth, net exports are forecast to weigh on
growth, as imports are also projected to pick up in

Many households still suffer from high debt-service-toincome ratios due to high interest rates and low incomes.

2014 and 2015. Consequently, the current-account
deficit is expected to gradually widen over the
forecast horizon.
Inflationary pressures easing in 2013

Romania exhibited the highest inflation rate in the
EU in the first half of 2013 mostly due to rising
food and energy prices. Inflation declined during
the summer to reach 1.1% y-o-y in September.
This mainly reflected a sharp drop in food prices.
Inflationary pressures are set to recede for the rest
of 2013 and thus annual average inflation is
forecast to be around 3.3% in 2013. Inflation is
projected to decelerate further to an average of
2.5% in 2014 as falling food prices are expected to
drive inflation to historical lows in the first half of
2014. In 2015, inflation is set to average 3.4%
given the steady recovery in domestic demand and
the on-going price convergence towards the EU
average.
Labour market remains subdued in 2013 with
unemployment on the rise

After falling below 7% in the second half of 2012,
the unemployment rate started increasing in early
2013. With growth expected to strengthen in the
second half of 2013, unemployment growth is now
slowing down. The average unemployment rate in
2013 is projected to be somewhat above 7% and to
broadly remain at this level over the forecast
horizon. Youth unemployment remains high at
23% but it is expected to fall supported by a
number of policy measures elaborated in the
National Job Plan to facilitate the entry into the
labour market of young people.
The 2011 reform of the labour code has started
producing results, albeit slowly, with the number
of employment contracts growing by 0.4% in the
first half of 2013. Growth among self-employed
has been stronger. Employment is projected to
grow only slowly as economic activity gradually
recovers. Private sector compensation is expected
to grow moderately in 2013. Due to relatively low
inflation, real wages are set to increase by up to
2% in 2013.

Member States, Romania

Fiscal adjustment to continue

After falling to 3% in 2012, the budget deficit in
Romania is expected to be further reduced to 2.5%
of GDP in 2013. Some underperformance in
revenue outcome has been counterbalanced by
reduced domestic capital expenditure and reduced
provisions for corrections linked to problems in
EU funds absorption. The revenue shortfall partly
stemmed from a less tax-rich growth pattern linked
to the shift to export driven growth during 2013.
For 2014 the budget deficit is forecast at 2.0% of
GDP,(25)
incorporating partial information
available regarding the draft budget likely to be
passed in November. The projection includes a
limited increase in pension payments as foreseen
by the law, a raise in public sector salaries worth
3% of the total wage bill and a limited decrease in
total capital expenditure, as compared with 2013.

to decrease further to 1.8% of GDP in 2015. The
structural deficit is forecast to mildly improve over
the forecast horizon from about 2% in 2013 to
1½% in 2015. The public debt level is forecast to
peak at just above 39% of GDP in 2015. The main
risks to the budget over the forecast period relate
to: (i) less tax rich economic growth associated
with weak internal demand; (ii) renewed
accumulation of arrears, especially at local
government level; and (iii) limited progress with
restructuring state-owned enterprises that could
result in renewed pressure on the budget.

Deleveraging and financing costs crucial to the economic outlook
Downward revision with falling domestic
demand and slower recovery of exports

In 2012, GDP contracted by 2.5% in real terms and
stood at 8.5% below its 2008 peak level. Negative
quarterly outturns in 2013 in the first half of the
year, amounting to a 3.2% year-on-year
contraction of real GDP, confirmed that the
recession has deepened and prompted a downward
revision to the growth outlook in the spring
forecast. Real GDP is expected to drop by 2.7%
this year and by a further 1% next year on the back
of steadily declining domestic demand and a
somewhat slower-than-expected export growth.

is projected to decline further, albeit at a slower
pace of 2.7% as firms will need to start rebuilding
their production capacity and the contraction of
construction investment is projected to bottom out.
Positive export data in the beginning of 2013 were
mainly driven by a large increase in volumes to
non-EU countries. However, the trend reverted in
the second quarter. Subdued growth of intra-EU
exports is projected to lead the way to a fragile
recovery throughout the forecast horizon. The
contribution of net exports to growth in 2013 is
somewhat further muted by the increase in
imported goods related to the one-off investment
in the coal power plant.

A tepid recovery of the economy is forecast to start
only in the second half of 2014 and to continue in
2015, albeit at a very slow pace. The rebound
would be driven by net exports, as global
economic conditions improve, while the
deleveraging is set to continue weighing on
domestic demand.

Downward revisions of 2012 national accounts
data point at a much more severe retrenchment of
private consumption than previously recorded, at
4.8%. Consumption is expected to continue its
downfall throughout the forecast horizon on the
back of weak fundamentals, notably rising
unemployment and declining real disposable
income. Positive data on purchases of durable
goods and new car registrations in the second
quarter of this year are considered temporary as the
increase in the VAT rates and other tax measures
that came into force on 1 July 2013 led to an
anticipation of purchases.
Gross fixed capital formation was supported in the
first two quarters of 2013 by the recently
constructed coal power plant. However, over the
year as a whole, investment is seen to contract
further, mirroring the on-going deleveraging
process in the economy, low profit expectations
and tight financing conditions. In 2014, investment

The recession is projected to bottom out in
2014

Risks to growth and domestic demand in
particular, are related to the financing conditions
for the overall economy, which in turn hinge upon
the speed of the required deleveraging process and
the implementation of the needed bold structural
reforms.
A lagged adjustment in the labour market

The unemployment rate rapidly increased to 10.8%
in the first quarter of 2013, from just below 9% at
the end of 2012, as a large number of temporary
contracts expired and were not renewed. The
lagged adjustment in the labour market is expected
to continue, with employment contracting
throughout the forecast horizon although at a
gradually declining speed, following the required
deleveraging in both the private and the public
sector.
Real wages have been dropping as a result of the
weak growth and labour market outlook as well as
the budgeted cuts in public sector wages, resulting
in a stabilisation of unit labour costs in 2013
followed by a small decline in both 2014 and 2015.

Member States, Slovenia

Core inflation is set to remain subdued, although
this year's inflation will be marked by tax effects
and is likely to stay just above 2%.
Bank recapitalisations increase the general
government deficit in 2013 and 2014

From 3.8% of GDP in 2012, the general
government deficit for 2013 is projected to be at
5.8% of GDP (4% of GDP without bank
recapitalisation) after including measures from
successive consolidation packages. Overall,
nominal cuts in public sector wages and workrelated benefits, a reduction or freeze of social
benefit rates and higher VAT rates are the main
consolidation measures in 2013. Their positive
budgetary impact is projected to be partially offset
by the large increase in interest and pension
expenditure (by a combined 0.8 pp. of GDP).
For 2014, the forecast incorporates the draft budget
and new real estate tax as approved by the
government in September and October,
respectively, but not yet adopted by parliament.
Including bank recapitalisation needs estimated by
the government at 3.4% of GDP, the deficit in

2014 is projected to increase to 7.1% of GDP
(3.6% of GDP without the recapitalisations). The
tax-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase in
particular because of the new real estate tax, the
elimination of the indexation for personal income
tax allowances and tax bracket thresholds. On the
expenditure side, the freeze of social benefit rates,
including pensions, will be extended to 2014 and
2015. Moreover, the May 2013 agreement to cut
public sector wages will further reduce the wage
bill in the first half of 2014. Under the usual
no-policy-change
assumption, the
general
government deficit for 2015 would stand at 3.8%
of GDP. Measures underpinning the draft 2015
budget are not yet specified, negotiated and
adopted.
The structural balance is forecast as broadly stable
in 2013, before improving by ¾% of GDP in 2014
and deteriorating by ¾% of GDP in 2015.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 63% of
GDP in 2013 and increase to 70% and 74% of
GDP in 2014 and 2015, respectively, mainly due to
primary deficits, including bank recapitalisations,
subdued growth and higher debt servicing costs.

Growth set to gather pace after 2013
Acceleration of economic activity after 2013…

Real GDP is projected to increase by 0.9% in 2013
supported by recovering household demand, with
net exports driving growth through a strong
positive contribution. Having plummeted in the
beginning of the year, investment stabilised in the
second quarter, but over the year 2013 as a whole
it is still expected to exert a strong drag on growth.
In 2014 and 2015, the Slovak economy is forecast
to follow a firmer recovery path, with real GDP
growing by 2.1% and close to 3%, respectively.
Economic activity will be increasingly driven by
domestic demand. The associated decline in the
unemployment rate is projected to remain modest,
however. Inflationary pressures are expected to
remain weak over the forecast horizon.
… with a more balanced growth composition

Private consumption expenditure picked up in the
second quarter of 2013, growing by 1.1% q-o-q.
However, the push came mainly from nondurables and services, while consumption of
durables continued to stagnate. Given persistently
weak labour market conditions and subdued
growth in real disposable income, household
consumption is expected to increase only gradually
in 2014 and 2015.

investment, which is set to decline, in spite of the
completion of a large project in the car industry.
This will weigh negatively on equipment
investment in 2014, when it is projected to
decrease further. On the other hand, construction
activity is expected to recover somewhat. New
residential construction should contribute to a
gradual pick-up in housing investment already in
2014 after seven consecutive quarters of decline.
In the same year, a positive impulse is also
expected from motorway construction.
Exports grew strongly in the second quarter of
2013 and are expected to continue expanding in
the second half of the year, albeit at a slower pace.
Imports are projected to gradually pick up,
although they may be dampened by the long run
trend of diminishing import intensity of Slovak
exports. The forecast shows a rebalancing in
growth, with domestic demand replacing net
exports as the more important contributor in 2014.
Country-specific risks to the forecast are broadly
balanced. Downside risks come from potential
delays in the implementation of large infrastructure
projects. On the upside, the rebound in private
consumption could prove to be more persistent,
supported by a stable increase in consumer credit.
Labour market conditions remain weak

Employment is foreseen to grow only modestly in
2014 and 2015 and the unemployment rate is
expected to remain above 13% Most of the
country's unemployment is long-term, suggesting
that unemployment is more of a structural than
cyclical nature. In addition, despite the large pool
of jobless workers, compensation of employees is
projected to grow modestly by 2% in 2013 and to
gather pace in subsequent years, suggesting
segmentation of the labour market. Thus,
Slovakia's recovery is projected to be driven
mainly by further productivity increases.
Low inflation over the forecast horizon

Despite improving business confidence, corporate
loans have decreased further in the second quarter
and indications of business plans do not suggest a
strong recovery in investment in the near future. In
2013, investment is projected to fall by 5.3%
mainly on account of a plunge in equipment

94

Inflation decreased markedly in 2013 and is
projected to remain below 2% over the forecast
horizon, mainly due to decreasing commodity
prices and the dampening effect of price regulation
in the energy sector on inflation.

Member States, Slovakia

Most of the consolidation measures for 2013 were
included in the 2013-15 budget and were
concentrated on the revenue side. Additional
measures were introduced in the course of the year
in response to revenue shortfalls. The general
government deficit is estimated to reach 3% of
GDP in 2013, some 1.5 pps. lower than in 2012.
This will have been achieved partly through oneoff revenue measures, such as the sale of
emergency oil reserves and the decision to enable
moving assets from the statutory fully funded
pillar to the public pension scheme.

revenue. Major expenditure savings are planned
for health care and reforms in the public sector.
However, information on measures to prevent
repeated accumulation of hospitals' liabilities is not
available in detail. There are also implementation
risks with regard to the reform of the public sector.
Hence, it is not expected that these measures have
the full effect on public finances estimated by the
government. Additional savings are expected
mainly on public investment expenditure. In 2014,
the deficit is projected to increase to 3.2% of GDP
with risks tilted towards a lower deficit outturn.
The structural balance is set to deteriorate,
however.

The 2014-16 draft budget assumes a further
improvement in public finances driven mainly by
additional revenue. This is expected to come from
a postponed pay-out of dividends and the
extension of the levy on companies operating in a
regulated environment, which was supposed to
expire in 2013. Moreover, the government intends
to introduce a minimum lump-sum corporate
income tax, to be accompanied by a reduction of
the corporate income tax rate from 23% to 22%.
Overall, these measures are expected to boost tax

Despite the expected cyclical recovery, and a more
tax-rich GDP growth composition, the deficit is
foreseen to increase further in 2015 as the VAT
rate is set to decline from 20% to 19% –
conditioned upon the deficit outcome in 2013 –
and one-off measures adopted in 2014 are set to
expire. On a no-policy-change basis, the debt-toGDP ratio is projected to rise to 58% in 2015
despite the plans to use privatisation and
extraordinary dividend proceeds for debt
reduction.

26. FINLAND
Slow recovery amid structural changes
Economic atony to continue in 2013

The decline of the Finnish economy in 2012 was
revised from an initially published -0.2% to -0.8%.
With the contraction continuing in the first quarter
of 2013, the economy was facing a recession for
four consecutive quarters before returning to tepid
growth in the second quarter of 2013. In light of
the strong negative carry over from 2012, in 2013
as a whole the economy is projected to post
negative growth of -0.6% despite an expected
continued slow growth in the second half of the
year.
Several quarters of negative growth appear to have
depressed confidence of consumers and producers
alike. Consumers have become cautious and are
delaying the purchase of durable goods, especially
cars. In addition, at the beginning of 2013 real
disposable income was reduced by the 1 pp.
increase in the VAT rates and an effective increase
in income taxation. Credit growth has slowed
down. Consequently, in contrast to previous years
no positive growth contribution is expected from
private consumption.
Investment has been held back by a weak outlook,
as confirmed by low confidence indicators. The
decline affects construction as well as machinery
and equipment investments. Industrial production
declined in 2012 and is at best stabilising. The
traditionally high contribution from the electronics
sector has reached a multi-decade low. Industrial
growth is now led by the chemical and metal
industries. Inventory depletion is forecast to
continue in 2013, and a slow build-up is forecast
for 2014.
Although export growth is weak, the decline in
imports is even stronger, resulting in a positive
contribution of net exports to growth.
Consequently, it is rather the sluggish domestic
demand than the strong export performance which
is expected to improve the trade and currentaccount balances.
Gradual recovery over 2014-15

For 2014 a 0.6% recovery in real GDP growth is
forecast, in 2015 growth is expected to reach 1.6%.
Private consumption continues to be held back by
weak disposable income growth, as wage restraint

96

needs time to translate into positive employment
growth. A pick-up in investment is forecast for
2014 and 2015, as weak investment in previous
years leaves room for catching-up once growth
gains traction. This could be further facilitated by
favourable lending conditions and low interest
rates over the forecast period.
Finland is forecast to continue losing world market
shares, though to a lesser extent than in recent
years as some structural changes have already
materialised and projected developments in cost
competitiveness favour export growth. In turn,
sluggish domestic demand will dampen the growth
of imports. Consequently, the current-account
balance is, though remaining negative, set to
improve over the forecast period.
Risks, mainly external, are balanced

Risks to the outlook are balanced and mainly
connected to exports. Industrial restructuring could
be in a more advanced phase than currently
considered, which could result in stronger export
growth, also taking into account the moderate
wage agreement and a potentially stronger
recovery in export markets. In contrast, export
share losses could be larger than forecast as
Finland's key industries face continued structural
challenges and competitive pressures.
Weak labour market and slowing inflation

The labour market started to deteriorate in late
2012. The number of employed and hours worked
are declining. In 2013 the unemployment rate is set
to increase to 8.2% and, with sluggish growth, will
remain broadly stable until 2015.
In October, the social partners reached a national
collective wage agreement where wage growth for
2014-15 is significantly lower than in the 2012-13
agreement. As a result, increase in unit labour
costs will be lower than in previous years. Wage
restraint, while weighing on consumption in the
short term, could help strengthening net exports,
employment and growth in the medium term.
Despite the consumption tax increase in 2013 and
further indirect tax increases in 2014, inflation is
set to recede to 2.2% in 2013 and to further
decrease over 2014-15 owing to lower wage

General government balance

Public deficit worsens

The government adopted significant adjustment
measures on the revenue side for 2013 and limited
the growth in expenditure to strengthen the central
government finances, but the general government
deficit is still set to widen in 2013 compared to
2012 (from -1.8 to -2.2% of GDP) as the shortfall

in revenues caused by weak economic growth
offsets the impact of the consolidation measures.
Longer-term outlook could be improved by the
successful implementation of the structural
reforms programme concerning labour market,
government efficiency and business environment
that was announced in August 2013.
In 2014, Finland will reduce the corporate income
tax rate, increasing at the same time the taxation of
dividends. Taxes on alcohol, sweets, tobacco and
energy will also be increased. Due to the changes
in corporate taxation and sluggish growth, the
deficit is set to further widen to 2.3% of the GDP
in 2014. With growth returning in 2015, public
finances are set to improve with the deficit
declining to 2% of GDP. The structural balance is
estimated to deteriorate over the forecast horizon
and reach -1¼% of GDP by 2015.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is influenced by the
expected increasing annual deficits but also the
downward revision to nominal GDP for 2012.
Based on these developments, the general
government debt is expected to reach 61% of GDP
by 2014 and climb to 62.5% in 2015.

27. SWEDEN
A domestic-demand-driven recovery
Signs of recovery after a weak first half of 2013

Following more robust than expected growth in the
first quarter of 2013, the Swedish economy slowed
down in the second quarter as household
consumption decelerated and exports fell. Weak
growth in aggregate demand led to stock building
by firms. As domestic demand rebounds and fixed
investment picks up, GDP growth is forecast to
resume in the third quarter and accelerate in the
fourth.
The latest survey indicators project positive signs
for the near future. The Economic Sentiment
Indicator has been above its historic average since
June and reached 102.2 in September, mainly
driven by consumer and services confidence
indicators. However, industry, retail trade and
construction confidence indicators remain low.
Therefore, in the short term, growth is expected to
be moderate.
Accelerating growth over the forecast horizon

GDP growth is expected to pick up gradually over
the forecast horizon, from 1.1% in 2013 to 2.8% in
2014 and 3.5% in 2015. Unlike in previous
recoveries which were typically export-driven, the
main push for growth is expected to come from
domestic demand.

Exports contracted further in the first half of 2013.
This development reflects continued subdued
demand from the EU countries as well as the
strong krona. Exports are expected to remain weak
in the second half of 2013 but to resume growth in
the last quarter. Imports are expected to follow
exports closely, given the strong import content of
Swedish exports, and to grow fast as investment
and domestic demand accelerates in 2014,
increasing slightly stronger than exports in 2014
and 2015. As a result, the large external surplus is
expected to decrease slightly over the forecast
horizon.
Risks are broadly balanced. Concerns related to
high private debt and a potential fall in house
prices are still present. The strong krona may
continue to weigh on Swedish external
competitiveness although exporters have so far
defended their position through squeezed margins.
On the positive side, exports could rebound more
strongly than expected given the evolution of the
global business cycle.

Household consumption is projected to be the
main driver of growth in 2013 and projected to
remain so in 2014 and 2015. Household spending
is expected to become increasingly encouraged by
improvements in the labour market, a low interest
rate environment and income tax cuts announced
in the 2014 draft budget. The household saving
rate, which reached a record high level in 2012 due
to a high unemployment rate and uncertainties
about the euro-area outlook, is expected to
decrease over the forecast horizon once uncertainty
subsides and precautionary savings are reduced.
Fixed capital formation is set to resume gradually,
becoming an important contributor to growth in
2014 and 2015. Residential investment is expected
to rise during the forecast period given the housing
backlog. Linked to the expected recovery in
exports, industrial capacity utilisation is expected
to rise, paving the way to investment outlays in
2014 and 2015.

Recovering labour market and low inflationary
pressures

Despite a weak economy, employment has
continued to grow in 2012 and 2013 and is
expected to continue growing over the forecast
period. Unemployment stabilised in the first
quarter of 2013 before decreasing slightly in the
second quarter. This turnaround in the labour
market is further supported by rising PMI
employment expectations. Unemployment is
expected to decrease slowly in 2014 and more

significantly in 2015 in connection with stronger
growth dynamics.
After having fluctuated around 0.9% in 2012,
HICP inflation dropped in the first and second
quarters of 2013 to 0.7 and 0.3% respectively on
account of lower energy costs and contracting
prices in the non-energy industrial goods sector.
Given the assumed subdued outlook for energy
and the continued impact of the strong krona,
inflationary pressures are expected to remain
comparatively low in 2014, accelerating to 1.8% in
2015 on the back of vigorous economic growth.
Wage developments are expected to contribute to
the low-inflation environment as the 2013 pay
settlements, which run for three years, indicate a
moderate rate of wage growth by historical
standards. The current slack in the labour market
also points to moderate growth in employee
compensation.

measures and infrastructure investment are
widening the headline deficit to 0.9% of GDP in
2013 from 0.2% in 2012. Taking into account the
2014 draft budget and its focus on improving
household disposable income through tax cuts, the
deficit is expected to reach 1.2% in 2014. The
combination of accelerating growth and the
nominal expenditure ceiling embedded in the
Swedish fiscal framework will allow the deficit to
improve to 0.5% of GDP in 2015 under the
"no-policy-change assumption". The structural
balance is estimated to turn slightly negative in
2014 and 2015 driven by an expansionary fiscal
stance in 2014 and a narrowing of the output gap.
The decline in the government debt-to-GDP ratio
will be reversed in 2013, also on account of
additional borrowing of SEK 100 billion to
strengthen the currency reserves of the Riksbank.
In 2014, debt is expected to tick up before falling
back in 2015.

28. THE UNITED KINGDOM
Tangible improvements but some lingering uncertainty
Growth looking up

Following an especially weak performance in 2012
whereby annual growth was revised down to 0.1%,
2013 has thus far exceeded expectations and the
outlook is quite bright. Growth of 1% in the first
half of 2013 has stemmed mainly from domestic
demand, namely private consumption. Net trade
made a positive contribution of 0.3 pp. in the first
quarter but this was as a result of a large decline in
imports.

Net exports
Dom. demand excl. inv.

The outlook has improved substantially since
spring with growth forecast at 1.3% in 2013. This
is based on private consumption continuing to
improve as inflation declines gradually. Investment
should also grow more strongly in the second half
of the year as credit becomes more easily available
and uncertainty recedes further. Finally, a small
but positive contribution from net trade is
expected. Over the forecast horizon to 2015,
growth is projected to improve with domestic
demand remaining the main driver and net exports
improving slowly but steadily. Growth is forecast
at 2.2% in 2014 and 2.4% in 2015. The main risks
to the forecast stem from an extension of weak real
wage growth, investment being further postponed
and the expected upturn in net exports failing to
transpire.

back slowly, consumer confidence has improved
as employment growth was very strong in 2012.
The expectation is for consumers to dip into their
savings and continue spending with the outlook for
real wage growth to turn positive at the end of
2014 and into 2015. However, the debt burden of
households remains a distinct risk to private
consumption.
Caution diminishing on the side of investors

During the first half of 2013, gross fixed capital
formation contributed positively to growth but the
second quarter highlighted the poor rate of
business investment with only construction
growing in that quarter. Dwelling investment
increased from low levels. Soft indicators suggest
that an improvement in business investment has
been underway since mid-year along with positive
but lower contributions from construction as a
result of the credit easing measures put in place,
strong cash reserves of larger companies and a
decrease in euro-area tensions. The outlook for
2014 and 2015 is one of strengthening confidence
and continuing improvements in credit supply.
Marginal improvements in net exports

After a weak and volatile period for net exports
since the depths of the crisis, there are finally some
signs of improvement afoot. Net exports
contributed by 0.3 pp. to growth in the first half of
2013 but this was entirely in the first quarter of the
year and due to a large fall in imports. Exports
grew strongly in the second quarter but imports
followed suit. Since wage growth is low, the
competitive position of the UK improves and
import substitution is likely to play a role in
rebalancing the economy. The outlook is that net
exports should contribute positively to growth in
2013 with increases thereafter as uncertainty
recedes in the euro area, the UK’s main trading
partner, and exports to non-euro-area countries
strengthen.

Consumption growing and improving

Private consumption contributed 0.5 pp. to the 1%
growth during the first half of 2013. It has now
increased in each of the last seven quarters and is
expected to continue to do so over the forecast
horizon. Whilst nominal wage growth has
remained sluggish and inflation has only fallen

100

Inflation falling at a leisurely pace

Inflation had generally been on a downward
trajectory since 2011 but the quarterly rate ticked
upwards at the end of 2012 and the start of 2013
owing to a rise of tuition fees in England and
increased prices for food and household goods.

Member States, The United Kingdom

However, despite the anticipated increase in
regulated and administered prices, inflation is
expected to generally fall over the forecast horizon
with it reaching the Bank of England’s target of
2% at the end of 2015. This is due to continued
weak pay growth in the very short term, the
elimination of the fuel duty escalator in September
2014 and the recent appreciation of sterling which
should dampen import prices. Furthermore, given
the spare capacity in the economy, the expectation
is that growth can be achieved without overdue
pressure on inflation in the short term. Inflation is
forecast at 2.6% in 2013 but falling to 2.1% in
2015. The main risk to the forecast is renewed
pressure from commodity prices.
Resilient employment

Despite the anaemic growth of 2012 and the public
sector job cuts, the employment rate actually grew
by 1.2% over the period. This may imply that the
current recovery will not see large falls in the
unemployment rate as otherwise might have been
expected. The expectation is for productivity to
recover before tangible effects are felt in the labour
market. Therefore, the forecast is for
unemployment to decline slowly from 7.8% in
2013 to 7.3% in 2015.

Deficit on the decline

The fiscal consolidation plan continues and the
Spending Round 2013 details the measures until
2017-18. The large decline in the deficit from
11.4% in the financial year 2009-10 to 5.2% in
2012-13 is partly explained by transfers that were
independent of the consolidation plan. The
transfers from the Asset Purchase Facility into
government accounts will continue to reduce the
deficit over the entire forecast period, but in
decreasing amounts. There is also a one-off
reduction in the deficit of GBP 3.2 billion (0.2% of
GDP) in 2013-14 owing to a tax cooperation
agreement with Switzerland to clear past unpaid
taxes but going forward the amounts are not
expected to be significant. Nevertheless, owing to
the improved macroeconomic outlook and
allowing for a subsequent time lag in the fiscal
data, the deficit is expected to fall over the forecast
horizon to 4.4% in 2015-16. By contrast, the debt
ratio will continue rising over the entire period.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Nascent recovery gradually taking hold
Resilient investment increases drive recovery

After the economy stagnated in 2012, output was
3.4% higher in the first half of 2013 than in the
same period a year earlier. Even though the yearon-year growth rate of gross fixed capital
formation has been declining for the last four
quarters, investment remained the key driver of the
recovery, with some 8% growth in the first six
months. Private consumption stagnated in annual
terms, after a decrease one year earlier. Export
volumes increased by 3%, and imports declined
slightly, probably reflecting the deceleration of
import-intensive investment. Consequently, net
exports proved less of a drag on growth than in the
first half of the previous year. Performance in the
construction sector was particularly strong,
probably still benefiting from the substantial public
construction projects in the country's capital. Early
hopes for a turnaround in industrial production,
based on strong growth in the first months of 2013,
were dampened thereafter, and accumulated output
increases remained subdued in the first half of the
year.
Economic growth is expected to accelerate, with
real GDP projected to increase by some 2% in
2013, about 2½% in 2014, and 2¾% in 2015.
Investment is likely to reaccelerate and provide the
main contribution to growth over the forecast
horizon, mainly on account of strong foreign direct
investment and public investment spending. The
recent and projected further increase in
employment, and the rise in pensions and social
transfers in early 2013 are drivers of a positive
outlook for disposable incomes. A benign inflation
scenario is expected to contribute to a stabilisation
of real net wages. Complemented by resilient
growth of consumer credit, this development is
expected to lead to an increasingly positive
contribution to domestic demand from private
consumption over the forecast horizon.
Net exports are not contributing to growth

After weighing negatively on growth in 2012 and
2013, the contribution of net exports to growth is
projected to remain largely neutral in 2013, and to
become negative again in the following two years
as imports are set to pick up in connection with
stronger investment growth. The merchandise
trade deficit is likely to narrow somewhat this

104

year, on account of relatively strong export
growth, but to widen again in the two outer years
of the forecast. Import growth will be boosted by
strong investment dynamics over the forecast
horizon, driven by the start of production of
recently established foreign investment. With
current transfers expected to stabilise at a lower
level than 2012, when they attained 21.7% of
GDP, the current-account deficit overall is likely to
widen until 2015.
Foreign direct investment has been picking up
again after the slump in the previous year. In the
first half year, inflows amounted to 1.4% of
projected full-year GDP, and are expected to reach
some 3% of GDP at the end of the year. The
forecast expects continued strong growth in
foreign direct investment, which should somewhat
mitigate the recently increased reliance on external
borrowing to finance the current-account deficit.

Renewed growth and recent fiscal stimulus
provide impulse to labour market

Overall, the nascent recovery seems to offer some
support to employment, which was 4.3% higher at
the end of the first half of the year, compared to
the end of 2012. In the same period, the
unemployment rate decreased further, from 31% to
28.8%, which reflects to some extent increased
participation of formerly unemployed persons in
active labour market policies, as well as stricter
registration procedures. In line with output
developments, the major part of the new jobs was
created in the construction sector. The labour
market situation remained especially difficult for
young people, with the unemployment rate for 15
to 24 year olds at 51.7%, down by only 1.3 pps.
compared to the end of 2012. Given the expected
re-acceleration of investment growth, and the

Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

continuation of active labour market policy
programmes, employment is projected to increase
somewhat further over the forecast horizon. The
unemployment rate is likely to decline marginally,
by about 1 pp. each year. In line with employment
trends, average monthly gross wages are expected
to gradually increase, while apparent labour
productivity is likely to decline in 2013, and
improve again somewhat in 2014, given the lower
employment growth.
Public debt expected to increase further

spite of declining net lending, the central
government debt level is expected to continue to
rise. It increased by 13 pps. between 2008 and
2012, to 34% of GDP, and is projected to rise
further to 39.4% by 2015. This figure excludes the
debt of state-owned companies, such as the Road
Fund, whose balance sheets are affected by the
government's
credit-financed
infrastructure
investments. Hence, the gradual decline in budget
deficits is not sufficient to reduce or even stabilise
the debt levels.

The fiscal position fell behind target between
January and August 2013, when the central
government deficit reached some 3% of full-year
projected GDP. This was mainly due to the
settlement of arrears owed to the private sector, the
rise in pension and social transfer payments, and
weaker than expected revenue collection. This
prompted the government to raise the 2013 general
government deficit target from 3.6% to 3.9%. This
forecast assumes that the general government
deficit will drop to 3.7% this year, and gradually
decline by 0.2 pp. each year until 2015, on account
of contained rises in government expenditure, in
particular in public consumption. However, in

30. ICELAND
Policy uncertainty weighs on growth
Uncertainty weighs on domestic demand...

Following a growth rate of 1.4% in 2012, Iceland's
economy expanded by 2.2% in the first half of
2013. However, the underlying dynamics are
distorted by special factors, such as spending for
one-off investments and fishing inventory the year
before. So far, the recovery has been largely
supported by private consumption, while
investment remained weak. Commodity exports
are losing pace, partly due to a weakening demand
for aluminium. Record increases in tourist
revenues largely compensated for weaker revenue
from commodity exports. However, continued
uncertainty concerning government promises to
implement a household debt relief and entrenched
inflationary expectations appear to dampen private
consumption. Investment remained at historic lows
(at some 14% of GDP), which probably reflects
the currently uncertain global outlook but also a
high degree of uncertainty concerning the timing
and implementation of lifting capital controls.
Inflation remained significantly above the 2.5%
Central Bank target, with consumer prices rising
by 4% in the first nine months of 2013. The labour
market continued to perform well, with solid
employment growth and declining unemployment.
However, financial intermediation has declined,
with credit growth coming virtually to a halt.
Fiscal consolidation continued during 2013,
although at a decelerating pace.
…and Iceland's growth trajectory

The economic outlook is somewhat weaker than in
the spring forecast, reflecting a more hesitant
consumer and investment sentiment. Private
consumption growth is set to decelerate in 2013,
reflecting lower real wage growth, largely as a
result of still substantial inflation, eroding real
disposable income and consumer confidence.
Furthermore, uncertainty related to the promised
household debt relief might lead households to
delay consumption decisions. In 2014 and 2015,
continued employment growth and decelerating
inflation should support disposable incomes and
thus also private consumption.
Public consumption is likely to remain limited,
given the government's intentions to reduce the
debt burden. The forecast expects some longplanned investment projects in the energy-intense

106

and maritime sectors to be realised in 2014, which
however will also lead to higher imports in the
same year. The uncertainties related to the lifting
of capital controls will probably continue, thus
contributing to historically low investment ratios.
Total exports are projected to strengthen due to an
improved global outlook and continued growth of
the tourism sector.

Overall, output growth is expected to remain
below Iceland's long-term growth, reflecting
uncertainties related to the implementation of the
household debt relief and the lifting of capital
controls, persistently high inflation and subdued
global demand. Downside risks mainly result from
continued policy uncertainty, which could further
impede consumption and investment as well as
risks from weaker global growth. However, in case
of a swift and smooth lifting of capital controls,
Iceland would be in a better position to realise its
growth potential.
Labour market conditions are improving…

Labour market conditions are expected to improve
during 2014-15, however, the positive employment
effect, which might have come with strong growth
in tourism, might peter out in the coming years.
However, still solid increases in employment
should help to lower unemployment further,
towards 4½% by 2015. Long-term unemployment
will remain an important challenge.
…but inflationary pressures remain

In reaction to high inflation in 2012, monetary
policy has remained tight since then. Inflationary
pressures are expected to subside, benefiting from

Candidate Countries, Iceland

relatively low increases in import prices. However,
domestic inflation inertia, such as inflation-index
loans and wage pressures, driven by a few sectors,
are likely to keep price increases rather high. As a
result, annual inflation is expected to remain
considerably above the Central Bank's inflation
target of 2.5% over the forecast horizon.

2% of GDP. The forecast assumes that the new
government will respect its commitments towards
continued fiscal consolidation, as described in the
2014 budget proposal presented on 1 October. The
envisaged spending reductions should allow a
lowering of the deficit to ¾% of GDP in 2014 and
a largely balanced budget in 2015.
Graph II.30.2: Iceland - Public finances

Trade surplus is likely to decline

9

The surplus in trade in goods has recently
narrowed, largely due to weaker export revenues,
while the service balance benefited from increased
tourism and declining service imports. In view of
expected stronger domestic demand, imports are
expected to accelerate again. However, the
deterioration in the external balances is projected
to continue, albeit at a slower pace, since exports
are set to gain some strength as well.

Reducing public debt remains a challenge

The general government deficit dropped from

2013, revenue growth remained below targets,
largely reflecting weaker than expected growth.
This might keep the 2013 end-year deficit at some

After reaching a peak of nearly 100% of GDP in
2011, the general government debt-to-GDP ratio
started to decline in 2012. Thanks to substantial
primary surpluses in 2014 and 2015, the debt ratio
is likely to drop towards 85% of GDP by 2015.

Adjusting to a new reality
A deeper recession than expected

In 2012, adverse weather conditions and the
persistence of banks' credit tightening resulted in a
deeper than foreseen decline in agriculture,
construction and manufacturing. As a result, the
statistical office (MONSTAT) revised GDP
growth for 2012 down to -2.5% compared to
preliminary -0.5%.
In the first six months of 2013 the economy grew
by 2.4% y-o-y, largely driven by base effect in the
first quarter and the surge of electricity exports in
the second quarter due to exceptional weather
conditions and a boost in hydropower production.
Therefore, compared to the spring, the autumn
forecast presents a slightly faster growth scenario
in 2013.

contributions
pps

already start in 2014 and increase progressively
afterwards. In the energy sector, preliminary works
for the interconnection cable with Italy
commenced on the Montenegrin side. However,
the short-term net contribution from these
investments remains difficult to ascertain given the
small size of the country and its high import
dependence.
The unemployment rate is set to fall by around
1 pp. during the forecast period, but it remains
high at around 19%, while, employment will
maintain positive but subdued growth rates until
2015, when investments speed up. Weak labour
market dynamics have also been reflected in the
moderation of wages, contracting in real annual
terms since 2011. We expect wages to increase
broadly in line with a possible recovery of demand
for local labour.
In the first three quarters of 2013, average inflation
totalled 2.9% compared to 3.8% a year before, and
if the current trend is maintained, it may decrease
further to settle at some 2% by the end of the year.
The improvement in domestic demand may have a
limited impact on prices as private consumption
remains mostly driven by tourists' expenditure as
domestic wages and bank loans growth recover
only gradually during the forecast period.

Rekindling consumption and investments

Overall, private consumption is expected to reduce
significantly its pace of contraction in 2013 and to
switch into positive growth in the outer years.
Tourism, although halving from past year doubledigit growth rates, will still provide additional
support to private consumption together with a
revival of credit activity which, after four years of
contraction, has been registering positive growth
rates since beginning of the year.
A few but large tourism investments have been
launched in October 2013, setting the basis for
gross fixed capital formation expansion in the
coming years. Some minor preparatory works for
the highway section Smokovac–Mateševo could

In the first three quarter of 2013 the currentaccount deficit has been narrowing and could close
below – the still very high – 17% of GDP by the
end of the year. Yet, the improvement of the trade
deficit could reverse in the next years as exports'
base effects fade out and new capacities in tourism
and energy are yet under construction. The forecast
expects a deterioration of the income and transfers
balances as more foreign workers will be
employed. The increased broadening of the
current-account gap in 2015 should be fully
financed by net FDI inflows.
Overall, the economy might be entering a new
phase where the weight of the old industrial giants
has been considerably reduced and replaced by a
new paradigm based on tourism, energy and
services. Several risks cannot however be ignored,
such as those related to the financing of a major
highway project, the liquidation of the aluminium
factory, and the high level non-performing loans.

Candidate Countries, Montenegro

Slowed down consolidation

Budget performance has been improving markedly
in 2013. In the first eight months total revenue
grew by 7% y-o-y, supported by accelerating
economic activity but also more efficient revenue
collection boosted by the increases of the personal
income tax and VAT rates. However, at the end of
August 2013, the government paid EUR 103
million state guarantees resulting from the
bankruptcy of the aluminium factory KAP, raising
total budget expenditure by 8% above the plan and
derailing the deficit target by two percentage
points of GDP. Despite some extra costs related to
KAP bankruptcy overflowing into the 2014 budget
and some EUR 30 million increase in capital
spending for the highway in 2015, current
expenditure should decline in real terms while
budget revenue remain constant. Overall, we
expect the budget deficit to decline in the coming
years, from around 5% of GDP in 2013 to less than
3% in 2015.
The surge in external liabilities resulting from the
bank loans to cover KAP guarantees also pushed
public debt further up, and it could exceed 58% by
the end of 2013 as the government needs to borrow
around EUR 100 million to close the budget gap.

In July 2013, the government adopted a budget and
fiscal responsibility law (i.e. fiscal rules) setting
upper limits for public debt and budget deficit at
60% and 3% of GDP respectively. The rules would
be applied with the 2015 budget. As a
consequence, the consolidated deficit and debt
levels for that year might remain below these
limits. However, the rapid pace of growth of public
indebtedness remains the most important risk in
our forecast.

In uncharted waters
A fragile recovery…

The economy expanded by 2.7% and 0.2% (y-o-y)
in the first two quarters. Exports were the only
driver of growth, boosted mainly by the
automotive industry. Domestic demand fell across
the board as consumption declined and
investments plummeted, especially in the second
quarter. Mirroring the lack of demand, imports
stagnated.
High frequency indicators point at a continuous
weakness of domestic demand. Investments, in
particular, are set to fall further in the short-term
on the back of steep contraction in bank lending
and government investment cuts. Nevertheless,
strong exports are likely to prevail and keep the
economy on a growth trajectory in 2013.

demand would support an overall robust exports
performance. Imports are envisaged to slowly
catch-up, in line with increasing demand, turning
the net exports contribution to growth slightly
negative in the outer year of the forecast.
Rekindling investments and continuing good
exports performance may start relieving some of
the labour market pressures but only by the end of
2014. However, labour creation could easily get
overwhelmed by job losses in the envisaged
restructuring of the highly inefficient state-owned
enterprises and, even in a benign scenario,
unemployment is likely to remain very high over
the forecast horizon.

On the supply side, a good agricultural season
(recovering from bad weather in 2012) and
manufacturing activity has supported a rebalancing
of growth. However, the good performance of
manufacturing has been concentrated in a few
industries (automotive, pharmaceutical, chemical
and petroleum), while about two-thirds of its
subsectors continued to decline, pointing to the
fragility of the ongoing recovery.

…in uncharted waters

A series of fiscal consolidation and structural
reform measures, put forward in 2013, is expected
to support further rebalancing of the economy
away from consumption to investments and
exports. The expectation, however, is that this
process will be slow and with significant
implementation risks.
Growth is likely to remain constrained as the latest
measures take their toll on consumption. Further
improvements in the business environment,
increased government investments and confidence
effects would underpin an acceleration of gross
capital formation, albeit from a very low level. The
investment cycle would also depend crucially on a
recovery in bank lending, foreseen to start next
year.
Base effects are expected to drive exports growth
temporarily down in 2014 but improving external

110

The dinar has been broadly stable this year, with
limited interventions by the central bank to
smoothen excessive daily volatility. This, along
with weak demand, food price moderation and
base effects supported a rapid disinflation and the
inflation entered the central bank tolerance band
already in September. Looking ahead, weak
demand is likely to continue exerting
disinflationary pressure, although inflation is
expected to remain inherently volatile due to
structural factors.
External imbalances improving faster than
expected

Weaker than foreseen domestic demand and
additional fiscal consolidation measures are
envisaged to lead to slower than previously
expected imports growth. However, despite solid
exports growth, the space for improving the
current-account deficit is likely to be exhausted by

Fiscal sustainability: entering a danger zone

There were several rounds of fiscal consolidation
and structural reform measures throughout the year
– in May, in July (a budget revision) and in early
October (proposed as part of the preparation of the
draft
2014
budget).
However,
revenue
underperformance and spiralling interest payments
have undermined government efforts to reign in

the deficit, and the 2013 deficit is likely to
overshoot both the initial and the revised targets.
The consolidation measures, proposed in the
framework of the draft 2014 budget, envisage
increasing the reduced rate of the VAT from 8% to
10%, introducing higher progressivity in wage
taxation of public employees, and cutting subsidies
to enterprises in restructuring. These, and
indexations of wages and pensions below the
expected inflation rate, are expected to bring about
a 1.5 percentage points reduction in the deficit in
2014. However, higher interest and investment
spending and additional social expenditure related
to the restructuring of public enterprises would
keep the budget deficit high.
Absent further consolidation measures, the
government debt is on a path to reach above 70%
of GDP. Significant implicit liabilities, related to
underperforming
public
enterprises
could
potentially put additional pressure on the debt.
Furthermore, slippages or delayed implementation
of announced reforms could also derail the
envisaged consolidation path.

A moderate setback for growth
Accelerating growth in the first half of 2013

Following the post-recession bounce-back at the
beginning of the current decade, economic growth
slowed to an almost complete standstill in the last
two quarters of 2012. Helped by a move to a more
accommodative monetary policy and a rapid
increase in public spending, economic activity
picked up again in the first half of 2013. For the
six-month period as a whole, GDP was 3.7%
higher year-on-year. The renewed upturn in the
output cycle has been driven by three factors. The
largest contribution came from consumer spending
(2.8 pps.) which expanded strongly on the back of
accelerating bank lending. The stock of
outstanding consumer loans was 25% higher yearon-year at the end of June, up by about 10 pps.
from the beginning of the year. The second most
important contribution was government spending,
particularly public fixed investment, which added
2.6 pps. to growth. Finally, a switch from
destocking to inventory accumulation raised the
overall growth rate by 1.2 pps. As a sign that the
economic upturn was relatively fragile, private
fixed investments continued to decline and
subtracted a full percentage point from growth. Net
exports exerted an even bigger drag on growth
(-1.8 pps.) as export growth declined while import
growth increased. The worsening trade
performance was to a large extent caused by a
switch from net exports to net imports of
non-monetary gold unrelated to developments in
Turkey's international competitiveness.
Tighter financial conditions
domestic demand

are

curbing

Turkey's financial markets and the lira were under
strong downward pressure between May and
August. Growing expectations that US monetary
policy might become less accommodative reduced
the relative attractiveness of high-yielding
emerging market assets. In the case of Turkey,
investors' risk sentiment may also have suffered
from the domestic political unrest which started in
late May. In August, the escalation of the civil war
in neighbouring Syria added to the sell-off of
Turkish assets, reflecting – inter alia – the
country's dependence on energy imports from the
Middle East. In this context, the central bank
switched to a less accommodative monetary policy
stance in the summer months to counter capital

112

outflows and the lira's depreciation. The upper
band of the interest rate corridor (the overnight
lending rate) was raised in two steps from 6.5% to
7.75%. By early autumn, net capital inflows had
resumed and the pressure on Turkish assets had
eased, resulting in a partial recovery for stocks and
bonds. Nevertheless, by mid-October, the main
Istanbul stock index was still 18% lower than in
May while the yield on the two-year benchmark
government note was about 3 pps. higher. In
addition, regulatory measures were introduced in
October designed to rein in the expansion of
consumer loans, particularly credit card loans.
Overall, a significant tightening of financial
conditions has taken place since the spring which
is likely to curb domestic demand in the second
half of 2013 and beyond. The lira's 11%
depreciation in real effective terms between April
and September will support exports and dampen
imports, but only with a lag.

In the second half of 2013, economic activity is
expected to be close to stagnation on a seasonallyadjusted quarter-on-quarter basis. In addition to the
impact from tighter financial conditions, there will
be a dampening effect from lower inventory
accumulation and sharply reduced growth in public
investments. Due to the expansion in the first two
quarters, the annual growth rate should
nevertheless reach 3.5%. Next year, output growth
is expected to increase gradually, helped by the
recent depreciation. A low starting point would
result in a relatively moderate annual growth rate
of 3.0%. In 2015, stronger private consumption
and investment should bring GDP growth to reach
4.3%, close to most estimates of potential growth.

Candidate Countries, Turkey

Unemployment, inflation, and external deficit
to remain stubbornly high

In contrast to the pattern in 2012, employment
growth is projected to be lower than output growth
in the forecast period. At first, unemployment will
edge higher as the labour force continues to
increase, partly because of a rising participation
rate. Only in 2015 will output growth be
sufficiently strong to permit a modest reduction in
the annual unemployment rate to 9.2%.
Annual consumer price inflation is projected to
decline from 9.0% in 2012 to 7.7% in 2013. Since
July, the pass-through from the lira depreciation
has started to raise domestic prices. Lower
international energy prices should help to keep
inflation in the 7–8% range in 2014 and 2015
which is significantly above the central bank's
5%-target.
Little change is also forecast regarding Turkey's
large external deficits. Following last year's
improvement, the current-account deficit started to
widen again in the first half of 2013 when
economic growth re-accelerated and net exports of
gold turned into net imports. For the year as a

whole, a deficit corresponding to 7.0% of GDP is
projected. It is expected in the current projections
that lira depreciation and lower energy prices will
narrow the deficit somewhat in 2014 before
stronger domestic demand will result in a renewed
widening in 2015.
A continuing decline in the public debt ratio

In the context of sharply lower GDP growth in
2012, the fiscal deficit of general government
widened significantly. In the current year, the
deficit is forecast to decline to 1.7% of GDP, much
helped by rapidly rising tax revenues. Taking
account of the government's "Medium Term
Programme for 2014-2016" from October 2013,
the forecast expects the deficit to continue
fluctuating around 2% of GDP in conjunction with
the projected path for output growth. Specifically,
it means that the deficit will rise to 2.3% of GDP
in 2014 before falling back to 1.9% in 2015. For
the ratio of general government debt to GDP, it
means that the on-going downward trend can be
maintained throughout the forecast period. By
2015, public debt is projected to have receded to
32.5% of GDP which is about 14 pps. less than in
2009.

Political uncertainty affects growth
Political gridlock over fiscal policies dampens
the growth outlook in the short term

The growth forecast for the US has been revised
down to 1.6% in 2013 (from 1.9% in the spring) as
a weaker-than-expected first half of the year was
followed by the political crisis in the autumn that
led to the government shutdown and increased the
risk of a default. Growth is expected to accelerate
to 2.6% in 2014 (unchanged from the spring
forecast) and to 3.1% in 2015 reflecting the
steadily waning fiscal drag, as well as recovering
confidence, spending and investment.
According to the third (final) estimate, real GDP
growth accelerated to 0.6% q-o-q in the second
quarter, twice the rate registered in the first quarter
(0.3%). Consumer spending remained modest
(0.5% q-o-q), while private investment showed
strength (1.6%), driven by improvement in both
residential and non-residential investment. The
negative contribution of the government sector
eased to -0.02 pp., markedly less than in the prior
two quarters.

happened largely on the back of the participation
rate falling to a 35-year-low of 63.2% as a weak
labour market (more drop-outs from the labour
force; extending the education) interacts with the
ageing population (retirement of the baby-boom
generation).
Momentum strengthened over the summer but
signs of weakness emerge

Industry came out strong in recent surveys. The
ISM manufacturing index hit a 2½-year-high of
56.2 in September, while the non-manufacturing
index rose to 58.6 in August, the highest since
December 2005, to decline to 54.4 in September.
On the other hand, confidence among households
started to weaken after reaching recovery highs in
June/July and is likely to deteriorate further in the
autumn reflecting the effects of the shutdown.
The housing market continues its recovery
although signs of weakness emerged in late
summer, most likely reflecting rising mortgage
rates. The Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index
has continued to grow at above 12% y-o-y since
April, amid rising sales and activity, resulting in an
average contribution of the sector to GDP growth
of around 0.1 pp. over the past four quarters.
However, housing starts and new home sales
slowed visibly in August and September, as rising
mortgage rates are starting to curb demand.
Moreover, the government shutdown put a brake
on the new mortgage approval process thus further
weakening the momentum in the sector.

Monthly change in private non-farm employment (lhs)

Employment growth averaged a strong 214,000 a
month in the six months to April, but weakened
gradually to 143,000 on average in the third
quarter (the weakest since the first quarter of
2012). Moreover, most of the jobs tend to be in the
low paying service sector with limited impact on
wealth and spending (services accounted for nearly
98% of all jobs created in the second and third
quarters). The unemployment rate declined to
7.2% in September, a recovery-low. However, this

Policy deadlock clouds the outlook…

Following the failure of the US Congress to extend
the government’s spending authority into the fiscal
year 2014, "nonessential" parts of the US Federal
Government were shut down on 1 October. The
agreement reached in Congress on 16 October put
an end to the shutdown by providing funding for
the government through 15 January 2014 and
raised the debt limit (just one day before its
expiration), but only until 7 Feb. 2014. This
potentially sets up another confrontation over
fiscal issues early next year. To facilitate
negotiations, a conference committee was
established to reconcile major differences on the
FY2014 budget and suggest the direction of fiscal
policies going forward.

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

The consensus view is that direct macroeconomic
effects of the shutdown will be modest, in the
range of -0.1 to -0.2 pp. taken off fourth-quarter
GDP growth. However, to the extent that the
standoff took a toll on household and business
confidence, the negative impact will be higher and
may resurface in early 2014 as the fiscal debate
resumes around the new deadlines. Reflecting
these effects, and the weaker-than-expected growth
in the first half of the year, the GDP growth
forecast for 2013 is revised down to 1.6% (from
1.9% in the spring), while that for 2014 is kept
unchanged at 2.6%. Growth is expected to
accelerate to 3.1% in 2015. Regarding the fiscal
outlook, the underlying assumption is that
policymakers will put in place temporary solutions
averting major new crises (shutdown and/or
default) but that there will be no "Grand Bargain"type of agreement.
… and complicates exit from QE

The most recent bout of political brinkmanship and
the ensuing policy uncertainty adds to the
complexity faced by the Fed in timing and
communicating the exit from quantitative easing
(QE) and, subsequently, from near-zero interest

rates. The damage to economic activity and
confidence caused by the political standoff will
inevitably weigh on the Fed's decision about when
to slow its asset purchase programme from the
current rate of USD 85 bn a month. Given that
during the September meeting the Fed reaffirmed
its current policies "until the outlook for the labour
market has improved substantially", the weakening
of job creation over the summer, exacerbated by
the impact of the shutdown, increases the
likelihood of postponing the "tapering" until 2014.
Fiscal policy risks increase – yet again

Policy uncertainty has increased significantly in
recent weeks and skewed the balance of domestic
risks to the negative. If the political standoff is
repeated yet again around new fiscal deadlines,
then this will dramatically reduce the chances of
reaching a durable fiscal deal that addresses debt
sustainability, leaving the US with a steep and
badly structured fiscal consolidation in future
years. Furthermore, the Fed's monetary policy
constitutes a potential source of risk to the forecast
given the sensitivity of markets to the timing and
communication of the elements of its exit strategy.

35. JAPAN
Stimulus-driven growth firms up
Stimulus-driven growth firms up…

Japan's growth forecast has been revised up to
2.1% for 2013 (from 1.4% in the spring forecast)
and to 2.0% for 2014 (from 1.6% in the spring
forecast). In 2015 real GDP is expected to grow by
1.3%. The growth momentum accelerated in the
first half of the year on the back of the first two
arrows of 'Abenomics' – bold monetary easing and
expansionary fiscal policy.
Growth of 1.0% q-o-q in the first quarter was
mainly supported by private consumption and net
exports (0.5 pp. growth contribution each). Nonresidential investment finally started picking up in
the second quarter (0.9% q-o-q overall growth),
adding 0.2 pp. to growth. Near-term growth is
projected to firm up in the second half of the year
and remain sustained in 2014, as the consumption
tax hike from 5% to 8% scheduled for the second
quarter of 2014 should be partly offset by a
planned JPY 5 tn (EUR 38 bn) stimulus package
(1.0% of GDP).

four consecutive negative quarters and stagnant
growth in the first quarter. Machinery orders data
support the view that business investment recovery
is extending into the third quarter. Rising corporate
profits buoyed by restored export competitiveness,
continued easing in financial conditions and
stronger corporate sentiment prelude to a gradual
recovery in business investment ahead. Corporate
tax breaks expected in the new stimulus package
should also underpin capital expenditure over the
forecast horizon.

Further efforts on the structural reform and fiscal

however necessary if Japan is to achieve its stated
real GDP growth and inflation targets.

consumption…

resilient

private

Private consumption is expected to remain resilient
in the run-up to the consumption tax hike. Retail
sales have been edging up on an annual basis,
whilst the rebound in household sentiment should
be supported by rising stock prices (the Nikkei 225
is up 43% since last December's elections) and
signs of recovery in property prices. Nominal
wages remain sluggish despite stronger corporate
profits, but the unemployment rate keeps trending
marginally down – though recently edging up due
to new inflows into the labour force – and is
projected to remain low. The expected drag on
consumption from the tax hike should also be
partly softened by the planned new stimulus
measures.

Investment

Source: ESRI, METI

Housing starts have been trending up into the third
quarter pointing to moderate near-term growth in
residential investment ahead of the consumption
tax hike. The projected decline in the second
quarter of next year should be partly offset by tax
breaks for home purchases expected with the
planned stimulus package. Public investment –
which added 0.1 pp. to growth in both the first and
second quarter – should remain sustained for the
remainder of the year on the back of on-going
fiscal stimulus, whilst new stimulus measures are
expected to support public investment into next
year.
Net exports keep recovering

Net exports were a strong contribution to growth
over the first two quarters (0.5 pp. and 0.3 pp.
respectively). A recent rebound in the new export
orders component in Japan's PMI suggests ongoing export growth momentum, which is likely to
outpace resilient import volumes ahead. Over the
forecast horizon net exports are expected to
gradually improve on the back of the on-going
recovery in global demand and restored export

competitiveness (the yen's real effective exchange
rate has dropped to its 2007 level).
Monetary stimulus goes on…

Monetary policy has remained loose since the
inception of the Bank of Japan's Quantitative and
Qualitative Monetary Easing early April, and
should remain accommodative over the forecast
horizon. Bank lending rates persist on a declining
trend, and financial conditions are expected to
remain broadly supportive. Lending volumes have
kept rising since 2011(outstanding loans by major
and regional banks were up 2.3% y-o-y in
September), which reinforces expectations of a
gradual pick-up in private non-residential
investment.
…but the 2% inflation target remains difficult to
achieve

In the second quarter core CPI inflation (excluding
fresh food) started trending upward. Survey- and
market-based indicators point to a gradual reversal
in deflationary expectations, and core-core
(excluding food and energy) CPI inflation has
recently pulled out of negative territory.

Inflationary pressures have been however mainly
cost-push so far, driven by pricier imports due to
the weaker yen. In the near term front-loaded
consumption in anticipation of next year's tax hike
should maintain upward pressure on prices, as well
as above-potential GDP growth over the forecast
horizon. The 2% inflation target net of the tax hike
effect remains however difficult to achieve, and
subdued nominal wage growth does not bode well
for sustaining demand-driven inflation.
Risks

In the near term the risk of enduring negative
growth effects from the 2014 tax hike has been
partly offset by the stimulus measures announced.
Over the medium term the main downside risks
concern a lack of implementation on the structural
reform and fiscal consolidation fronts, which may
bring Japan's growth back to current potential,
hamper the achievement of its GDP growth and
CPI inflation targets, and ultimately engender
negative knock-on effects on Japan's fiscal stance
and debt sustainability.

package), leading to a pick-up in growth to the
estimated 7.8% in the third quarter.
Domestic consumption was the main driver of
growth in 2012. Consumption (public and private
combined) contributed some 4.3 pps. to overall
growth. Investment contributed 4.0 pps., while net
exports made a negative contribution of 0.6 pp.
Retail sales figures also showed a significant pickup towards the end of the year, and the relative
strength of consumption and overall activity was
expected to be carried over into 2013. However,
activity faltered early on in 2013, falling from
7.9% in the last quarter of 2012 to 7.7% in the first
quarter of 2013. The most significant factor was a
weakening on the investment side, though
consumption also moderated slightly. Exports
surpassed expectations however, picking up very
sharply. Overall in the first quarter of 2013,
consumption contributed 4.3 pps. to growth, with
investment 2.3 pps. and net exports 1.1 pps.
The rapid growth of net exports seen in the first
quarter did not carry over into the next one.
Exports grew by only 3.8% in value terms (down
from 18.4% in the first quarter) while imports
grew at 5% (8.5% in the first quarter). This was
partly offset by a rebound in investment activity,
but the reduction in net exports and weaker
consumption pushed the overall growth rate down
to 7.5%. Over the first half of the year taken as a
whole, consumption contributed to GDP growth
3.4 pps., investment 4.3 pps., and net exports just
0.1 pp.
This pattern of weakening consumption and net
exports, offset by rising investment appears to
have continued into the third quarter. Taking the
first three quarters together, consumption
contributed 3.5 pps. to overall growth, investment
contributed 4.3 pps., while net exports made a
small negative contribution of -0.1 pp. The general
pattern in the first half of 2013 has therefore been
one of steady but subdued growth in consumption,
a falling contribution to growth from net exports,

120

and a rise in investment that allowed economic
growth to recover from the soft patch in the second
quarter.

Looking forward

Domestically, consumption should be supported
somewhat through the rest of 2013 by positive real
interest rates on savings deposits, and a continued
roll-out of measures to broaden the social security
net. However, urban income growth is now
slowing as wage inflation moderates and has fallen
below the growth of GDP. Consumption growth is
therefore expected to continue at a steady rate.
As regards investment, official data on fixed asset
investment shows little volatility over the last two
years, despite shifts in the contribution to growth
of gross fixed capital formation. High-frequency
investment data is therefore only a limited guide to
the outlook, particularly since some investment
spending is used as a form of countercyclical
policy. As concerns private investment, severe
overcapacities remain in some key industrial
sectors, while overall investment levels remain
very high as a percentage of GDP. This suggests
that an abrupt downward adjustment in demand is
possible.
Monetary policy remained accommodative through
the first half of the year, and credit growth has
continued at a rapid pace, while inflation has
lingered at a little over 2%. Policy rates have
remained unchanged since July 2012, and
interbank rates moved in a narrow range between
3 and 4%. In June, however, the PBoC instigated a
liquidity squeeze and allowed the interbank rate to
spike sharply, while warning market participants to

Other non-EU Countries, China

be more alert to credit risk. The interbank rate
remained high for several days before the PBoC
reversed course. This attempt by the PBoC to
adjust market participants' expectations indicates
substantial concerns about the volume and quality
of new credit issuance. Credit growth been high
for several years, and a significant and growing
part of new lending (estimated at 40%) is nonstandard, or part of the "shadow banking" system.
In addition, marginal adjustments in market rates
may have limited traction on overall credit
expansion given prevailing incentive structures.
As regards the external environment, the reduction
in export and import growth seen in the second
quarter of 2013 is unlikely to be reversed. The real
exchange rate of the RMB has risen by around 7%
since the start of this year. In recent months the
RMB has remained very stable against the US
dollar, while many emerging markets currencies,
including those of other Asian producers, have
fallen sharply. As global GDP is expected to pick
up only modestly over the forecast horizon the
outlook for trade remains subdued.
Overall, China is expected to grow at 7.5% in
2013, dropping to 7.4% in 2014 and 2015. This

forecast reflects two key assumptions. The first is
that China is gradually shifting to a lower trend
growth path, due to the fading of technological
catch-up, falling returns on marginal investment
and the onset of a decline in the overall labour
force. The second is that China can manage this
adjustment relatively smoothly and avoid any
abrupt slow down due to accumulated imbalances.
Risks to the outlook

While China remains exposed to global currents
the major risk factors remain domestic. Rapid
credit growth over recent years, while real activity
has been on a declining trend, suggests a growth of
stress in the financial system. Moreover, there are
persistent concerns about overinvestment. In this
respect, the pick-up in investment in the second
and third quarter is potentially a mixed blessing, as
it reverses the limited progress in rebalancing of
demand seen to date. The underlying requirement
is for a rotation of demand away from investment
towards higher consumption. However, achieving
this adjustment smoothly is a major policy
challenge and the risk of disorderly adjustment
remains real.

37. EFTA
Sustaining elevated structural growth and addressing new risks
Norway and Switzerland continue to have
economic characteristics that appear almost
exceptional in Europe. Both structural and cyclical
indicators point to these two EFTA countries being
at the forefront of current economic developments.
They have a sound macro-economic policy record
and proven comparative advantages. They have
weathered the crisis relatively well and have low
unemployment rates, low inflation rates, and
strong domestic demand. They benefit both from
their safe-haven status in case of increases in the
global risk premium in financial markets.
All this is reflected in relatively strong growth
performances over the last years which have also
raised their expected structural growth of which
estimates are well above those for the euro area.
Domestic demand has been a major driver of that
performance although the external sector has not
been as much a drag as the historical ties with the
euro area would have suggested.
EFTA states are highly open economies and
economic developments will vary with economic
developments abroad. Domestic demand has
proven an important cushion to those external
developments but has also been associated with
rising house prices and easy domestic financial
conditions in the context of capital inflows and low
interest rates. Relatedly, credit to the private sector
continues to be at relatively high levels and rising.
More importantly, the share of credit to households
is increasing on the banks' balance sheets. This
comes at the expense of the share of the nonfinancial corporate sector.

Property prices are rising relatively fast and
domestic demand growth is relatively strong at the
same time as household credit is expanding
robustly. This leads to a concern over
unsustainable developments. In both Switzerland
and Norway increases in capital requirements will
help to attenuate the risk of a housing bubble. Still,
the high share of funds made available to
households risks being at the cost of productive
investments and competitiveness in the nonfinancial corporate sector. Given the pressure on
competitiveness from appreciated currencies, one
would expect companies to use the loose financial
conditions to increase productivity in order to
lower production costs.
Strong domestic demand in the context of low
interest rates may have biased long-term growth
perceptions upwards. Actual potential output
growth may prove to be lower. Indeed, labour
productivity growth seems not to have kept pace
with GDP growth in recent years. In the case of
Switzerland this has been associated with a low
growth in total factor productivity for some time
(no comparable data for Norway available).

The total credit to the private sector relative to
GDP is one third higher than in the euro area (see
Graph II.37.1). This is equivalent to 50% of GDP.
At the same time, the share of credit to households,
which dipped during the 2008 financial crisis to a
level comparable with the euro area, is rising. This
aggregate figure reflects a continuously high share
of household credit in Switzerland and an
increasing share in Norway. According to the
figures from the BIS, credit to households grew at
a quarterly rate of 1.0% in Switzerland and 1.6%
in Norway since the end of 2008. According to the
figures from the SNB, the share of credit allocated
to manufacturing and industry has halved in the
last decade and was in the first quarter of 2013
only 3% of total credit to the non-financial
corporate sector.

Swiss economic outlook

The Swiss economy will grow this year and next
year around its potential growth rate. Domestic
demand will continue to be an important pillar of
Swiss economic growth and net exports are
foreseen to contribute as exports grow more than
imports.

Other non-EU Countries, EFTA

Private consumption growth has been remarkable
in Switzerland while uncertainty in the external
environment has had limited impact. Some
moderation is expected in the coming quarters as
domestic financial conditions normalise. Business
investment has been weak despite easy financing
conditions, and only moderate growth is expected
over the forecast horizon.
Externally, Switzerland is exposed to any
slowdown in demand from emerging markets,
while capital inflows associated with Switzerland's
"safe haven" status are expected to recede as risk
perceptions change for Europe. This provides
room for export growth in sectors other than niche
products, but will also tighten financial conditions.
A tightening of financial conditions would
generate some risk for domestic asset prices,
particularly housing, which have seen relatively
high price rises in recent years.
Liechtenstein's
economy
has
been
underperforming relative to the Swiss economy
which can be partly attributed to the absence of
large
commodity traders. Its
economic
development will follow that of the Swiss
economy.

Norwegian economic outlook

Economic growth disappointed in the fourth
quarter of last year and in the first quarter of this
year. The recent deceleration in economic growth
is expected to be temporary and a pick-up in
export demand and continued growth in domestic
consumption will support growth over the forecast
horizon. A modest acceleration in growth is further
supported by increased activity in the oil industry
spilling over into the mainland economy.
Investment plans support such a bolstering of
private investment growth.
The housing market has been identified as a risk in
previous forecasts, but has recently been letting off
some steam owing to healthy construction activity
and regulatory action. The support from the
housing market for economic growth will
continue, albeit at a slower pace.
Although the oil price has shown downward
rigidity, new impetus for economic growth will
likely have to come from higher shipments than
from higher prices. The oil price itself poses rather
a downside risk to the economic outlook for
Norway.

38. RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Growing pressure for structural reforms
Growth in Russia slowed more drastically in the
first half of 2013 than expected in the spring
forecast, reflecting weakness across the
components, though mostly domestic and
particularly in investment. Russia is now projected
to grow 1.9% in 2013, 3.0% in 2014 and 3.4% in
2015, implying a rebound to close to potential
growth, partly on the basis of the still favourable
oil price. Achieving these growth rates requires
rapid and tangible improvements in the business
environment, however, so the balance of risks is
skewed to the downside.
Weak start to 2013

While real GDP expanded by 3.4% in 2012, the
pace of growth in year-on-year terms has
weakened steadily since the last quarter of 2011,
and has continued into 2013, with growth at 1.6%
y-o-y in the first quarter and 1.2% y-o-y in the
second (the lowest rate since 2009). This
slowdown was evident across private and public
consumption as well as net exports, but was most
pronounced in gross fixed capital formation.

September. Consumer sentiment declined at the
start of the year, but has improved recently.
Investment growth has fallen sharply as stateowned enterprises in the energy sector slowed or
stopped spending, with investment in productive
capacity down by 1.6% y-o-y in September.
Industrial production stagnated at 0.1% y-o-y over
the period of January to September, while
company profitability and corporate borrowing are
both lower amid continued high net capital
outflows of USD 48.1 billion in the first three
quarters of 2013. Exports in the first half of 2013
declined by 3.8% y-o-y on weaker external
demand, while imports rose by 4.4% in the same
period. This resulted in a further narrowing of the
trade surplus to USD 91.6 billion. This broad
slowdown has also affected government revenues,
with the federal budget deficit reaching 1.2% of
GDP in the first half of 2013.
Policy fine-tuned

Against the backdrop of the faster than expected
pace of the slowdown and President Putin's
spending promises, the revenue shortfall has given
rise to renewed discussion of channelling pension
or reserve fund money into the budget. The
2014-16 budget now foresees government
borrowing at 0.7% of GDP in 2013, 0.5% in 2014
and 1% in 2015. Underlying GDP growth
estimates have also been reduced to slightly above
3% for the coming years, and the non-oil deficit is
set to remain at around 10% of GDP.

Private consumption declined the least as the
unemployment rate remains at historically low
levels (5.2% in September), and employment is
still expanding slightly. In line with the tight
labour market, real wage growth remained buoyant
at 8.2% y-o-y in September. Retail sales grew at
3% y-o-y in September, however, down from the
growth levels of last year as concerns over the
household debt burden have risen. Inflation has
remained above 7% over the first half of 2013, and
has only recently moderated to 6.1% y-o-y in

As inflation remained at elevated levels, the
Central Bank of Russia kept its benchmark
refinancing rate steady. At the first meeting under
the new Governor in July, the CBR did however
introduce a new lending facility against nonmarketable collateral that provided a limited
amount of liquidity. The CBR also introduced
some additional flexibility in the ruble band and
reconfirmed its commitment to a floating exchange
rate by 2015. While the inflation target for 2014
was raised to 5%, the commitment to inflation
targeting by 2015 was reconfirmed. Price pressure
is subsiding due in part to a good harvest this year,
and inflation is expected to continue its moderate
downward path to 5% in 2014 and 2015, giving
some room for a more accommodative monetary
policy. The administration's decision to reduce

Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation

scheduled rises in tariffs charged to household will
also slow price increases, at least in the short term.
Outlook

introduced only in January 2013, fiscal
consolidation measures are to be weighed carefully
against proposed spending to support education,
healthcare and infrastructure projects.

Expectations for the remainder of 2013 are for a
moderate turn-around in growth, in line with the
global picture and as measured by the composite
PMI, at 51.2 in September. Supported by
government plans to release limited stimulus
measures centred on transport infrastructure as
well as the Winter Olympics in early 2014, the
trend in fixed capital investment is expected to
change. The upwardly revised oil price
assumptions for 2013 should underpin this
improvement in the short term. The oil price is
then set to gradually decrease over the next two
years, but is expected to remain at historically high
levels.

Export volume growth is expected to be moderate
in 2013, but increase at an accelerating pace in
2014 and 2015, while imports will grow around
trend. The negative contribution of net exports is
projected to lessen over the forecast horizon.
Household consumption growth is set to moderate
due to concerns over the debt burden, somewhat
slower wage growth and the emerging decline in
the workforce due to demographic trends. Even as
the growth rate is projected to recover from 1.9%
in 2013 to 3% in 2014 and 3.4% in 2015, the
Russian economy is set to expand at a substantially
lower pace than the average of 7.5% between 2003
and 2007.

Over the forecast horizon, underlying trends are
largely set to resurface: investment is expected to
recover on high capacity utilisation and
government consumption is expected to contribute
only to a limited extent to growth. With the fiscal
rule linking expenditure to long-term oil prices

Amid intensifying structural challenges in the
longer term and without the support of rising
commodity prices, the crucial issues for Russia
remain the modernisation of the economy and the
needed improvements in the enabling of business
and innovation.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fullyfledged economic forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn.
These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic
aggregates for the Member States, the candidate countries,
the European Union as a whole, the euro area and the
international environment.

the individual countries in the EU or the euro area. However,
intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of
reporting errors. The creation of the internal market in 1993
reduced border controls and formalities, and accordingly the
scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage. Typically,
intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU exports,
leading to an overestimation of the surplus. For the past the
"adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB
estimates for the euro area. For the future, they are ECFIN's
forecasts based on the extrapolation of the discrepancies
observed in 2012.

2. Data for 2013, 2014 and 2015 are forecasts.
The source for all tables is the European Commission,
unless otherwise stated.
Historical data for the Member States are based on the European
System of Accounting (ESA 1995). Most Member States have
