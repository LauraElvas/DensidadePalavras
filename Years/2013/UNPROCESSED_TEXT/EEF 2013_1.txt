EDITORIAL
Grappling with the aftermath of a profound financial and economic crisis, the EU economy is set to pick
up speed only very slowly in the course of this year. Economic activity in the EU is forecast to stabilise in
the first half of 2013. After having turned positive in the second half of this year, real GDP growth is
projected to gain traction in 2014 as investment and consumption are set to take over as the main growth
engine. But domestic demand is expected to remain constrained by a number of growth impediments
commonly associated with balance-sheet recessions after deep financial crises.
These headwinds imply that the projected recovery of domestic demand over the forecast horizon will
remain modest. Debt deleveraging by banks, non-financial corporations and households has made
progress, but is likely to continue over the forecast horizon, while governments are proceeding on their
way to consolidate public finances, though at a lower structural pace thanks to the large efforts in the past
two years. Despite the accomodative stance of monetary policy and low average financing costs in the
EU, the debt overhang from the crisis has reduced credit growth. Financial fragmentation has further led
to binding credit-supply constraints in some Member States, which is detrimental in particular to the large
number of small and medium-sized enterprises which depend on bank loans to finance investment and
lack direct access to financial markets for investment funding. In the short run, private investment and
consumption are also being held back by uncertainty about the economic outlook, while the weakness of
the labour market will continue to weigh on domestic demand going forward.
Yet, the progress with policy reforms and economic adjustments which are set to turn the EU economy
into a more robust and efficient economic area, is undeniable. A number of Member States that
accumulated unsustainable current-account deficits before the onset of the crisis are expected to register
current-account surpluses this year, driven on the one hand by lower domestic absorption and on the other
by the adjustment of relative prices, costs and profit margins that favours an expansion of the tradable
goods sector. Non-price competitiveness has also improved in some countries. Financial market stress has
abated, vulnerable Member States are again attracting foreign capital, and bank funding has improved,
even though lending conditions for the real economy continue to differ by wide margins across countries.
The reduction in fiscal deficits is making headway in a differentiated way, emphasising the fiscal effort
expressed in structural terms, taking into account near-term economic conditions and fiscal space.
However, intolerably high unemployment in vulnerable Member States gives cause for a great concern as
it endangers social cohesion.
High unemployment points to the need for continuing the course of structural reforms. Moreover, in a still
fragile macro-financial context, it is essential to dispel doubts about the implementation of crisisresolution measures and structural reforms, which could result in another flaring-up of the crisis.
Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to press ahead with the implementation of the Banking Union in
order to overcome financial fragmentation as part of completing the architecture of EMU, facilitate
structural adjustment and unlock domestic demand. By moving forward with the necessary reforms, the
EU and the Member States can create the conditions for the improved financial market situation to feed
through to growth in the real economy and set in motion virtuous circles between growth, declining debt
levels and more stable financial conditions.

OVERVIEW
From stabilisation to
modest expansion

After the recession that marked the year 2012, the EU economy is forecast to
stabilise slowly in the course of the first half of 2013. A noticeable expansion
in GDP is expected to set in only in the second half of the year, but growth
should pick up at moderate speed in 2014. On the back of a global economic
recovery, external demand is set to remain the predominant growth driver,
while multiple headwinds continue to weigh on domestic demand. In
particular, balance-sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors,
difficult financing conditions in several Member States, the under-utilisation
of resources related to deep adjustment processes and unusually high
uncertainty will abate only very gradually over the forecast horizon. As a
result, annual GDP in 2013 is projected to decrease marginally in the EU and
contract by ½% in the euro area. For 2014, GDP growth is forecast at 1½% in
the EU and 1¼% in the euro area, which is expected to be just strong enough
to exceed the employment threshold and start reducing output gaps. This
forecast remains predicated on the assumption that continued policy effort
will prevent another aggravation of the sovereign-debt crisis.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2013

More support from the
external environment
…

Outside the EU, economic activity, which had weakened in the course of
2012, appears to have bottomed out. For 2013, global GDP growth is
projected at 3%. Among the major advanced economies, the underlying
dynamics of the US economy are expected to remain intact despite the fiscal
tightening induced by the so-called sequester. In Japan, large-scale fiscal and
monetary stimuli are projected to lift the economy out of recession. The
group of emerging market economies is likely to continue on a robust growth
path, but differences across regions have recently increased, with a robust
economic expansion in Asia and more moderate growth notably in Latin
America and Russia. World imports are expected to grow by 3¼% this year,
visibly faster than the EU Member States' export markets. Also dampened by
the past appreciation of the euro, EU exports are therefore forecast to increase
by only 2%.

… but little feedthrough of more
favourable financial
market developments.

Financial market conditions have remained overall favourable in the EU
following the very significant improvements in the second half of 2012.
However, market sentiment has become less upbeat in recent months as
incoming macroeconomic indicators were weaker than expected and the
improvement of confidence was interrupted. The easing in financial market
conditions has not reached all countries, and it has not yet led to an
improvement in the real economy. Reduced tensions in bank funding markets
coexist with varying bank lending conditions across Member States caused
by the ongoing weakness of the banking sector in several Member States, but
also by the different prospects for the respective real economy. This results in
still large differences in financing costs for the non-financial private sector
that are also visible from e.g. DG ECFIN's composite financing cost
indicator. Over the past months, credit to non-financial corporations
continued to contract, while credit to households expanded only at a very low
rate.

Domestic demand
returns only very
slowly.

The present forecast continues to rely on the assumption that a resurgence of
the sovereign-debt crisis is avoided as continued progress is made on the path
of needed structural reforms and policies to strengthen the framework of
EMU. This is expected to slowly dissipate lingering policy and economic
uncertainty and to eventually bring about a normalisation in financial
conditions across countries as well as a gradual return of confidence which
will in turn allow reviving domestic demand.
By the end of 2012, private consumption and investment had both fallen for
five quarters in a row and are also likely to remain very weak in 2013.
Deleveraging of banks, non-financial corporations and households has made
some progress, but is expected to continue weighing on domestic demand
over the forecast horizon. There are now some signs of financial
fragmentation being gradually reduced, which should ease over time the
difficult financing conditions in some Member States. Elevated uncertainty,
which is affecting spending and investment decisions, is set to fade gradually.
Against this backdrop, a gradual increase in domestic demand is expected in
the second half of this year. The annual growth rates for private consumption
and investment in the EU are however projected to remain negative, at -½%
and -1¾% respectively, in view of the negative carry-over effect from 2012.
The recovery of private consumption is predicted to be very slow. With the
need for households in some Member States to deleverage further, there is
little margin for reducing the saving rate in order to smooth out consumption.
Additionally, weak labour markets and expectations of further rising

2

Overview

unemployment continue to exert a substantial drag, which is only partly
compensated by the positive impact of lower inflation on real disposable
incomes. The expected recovery in gross fixed capital formation is projected
to be driven mainly by a rebound in equipment investment on the back of
export demand, low average financing costs, increasing profit margins and
gradually improving sales expectations. While net exports are projected to
remain the main driver of GDP growth in the EU this year, firming domestic
demand is expected to take over this role in 2014.
Looking further ahead, economic activity in the EU appears to have been
permanently affected by the crisis, due to slow post-crisis adjustment and a
long-lasting deterioration in financing conditions. On a more positive note,
potential growth, estimated at only ½% in the EU in 2013, is expected to
recover gradually over time as structural unemployment is reduced and
investment activity normalises. In other words, despite the level shift in EU
GDP, its growth dynamics should not be affected in the long term.
Growth differentials
expected to
moderate …

While no Member State has been immune to the impact of the economic and
financial crisis, differentials in GDP growth and labour market situations
across countries remain large. The German economy is projected to recover
gradually on the back of improving domestic demand helped by the robust
labour market and more dynamic wage growth. GDP in France is forecast to
stagnate this year amid modest net exports, while investment continues to
contract and private consumption remains stable. Economic activity in Italy
is set to decline again in 2013, as reduced disposable incomes, low
confidence and difficult financing conditions continue to weigh on
consumption and investment. In Spain, the correction of pre-crisis
imbalances remains a strong drag on domestic demand, which is only partly
compensated by the improving current account, and GDP is forecast to
contract further this year. GDP in the Netherlands is expected to fall further
in the near term as consumption remains constrained by low disposable
income and negative wealth effects from the housing market, while exports
perform well. Among the Member States outside the euro area, a moderate
acceleration in GDP growth is expected in the United Kingdom on the back
of gradually improving domestic demand. In Poland, GDP growth is forecast
to slow down further this year, as private consumption remains sluggish,
while export growth slows down and investment dips.
Yet, by the end of this year, most of the Member States that are currently in
recession are expected to register positive quarterly GDP growth again, and
the upswing is set to strengthen in 2014 across the EU. However, the large
differences in unemployment that have built up will take a long time to be
absorbed.

… as adjustment is
making progress …

External and internal adjustment is making further progress. In 2013, the
current account of several vulnerable Member States is expected to turn
positive, helped by lower domestic absorption as well as competitiveness
gains on the back of wage moderation and increased productivity. At a more
disaggregated level, there is evidence that the decrease in unit labour costs in
vulnerable countries has helped re-establish operating margins in the tradable
sector, which should help underpin the necessary reallocation of resources
towards the production of tradable goods. By contrast, in the non-tradable
sector, falling labour costs have been more likely to lead to a reduction in
(relative) prices. In surplus countries, more dynamic wage developments
herald larger growth contributions from domestic demand going forward.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2013

… but unemployment
is set to worsen further
in the near future.

Joblessness has increased steadily over the past two years, reaching 12% in
the euro area and 11% in the EU with a very large degree of divergence
across Member States. Survey data suggest a further deterioration of the
labour-market situation in the near term, given the usually lagged response of
employment to GDP. The reaction of employment to falling GDP has
become closer over recent quarters than it was in 2008-10, as labour is
reallocated across sectors of the economy, while there is little scope left for
reducing hours worked. The rising numbers of long-term unemployed and the
increasing labour-market mismatch bode ill for the employment prospects in
the medium term. In 2013, employment is expected to decrease further by
½% in the EU and ¾% in the euro area. For 2014, modest employment gains
around ½% in the EU and ¼% in the euro area are forecast.

Well-anchored
inflation

The gradual decrease in consumer-price inflation has accelerated in recent
months. HICP inflation fell to 2.0% in the EU and 1.9% in the euro area in
the first quarter of 2013 mainly on the back of slower increases in energy and
food prices. Core inflation (headline HICP excluding unprocessed food and
energy) is projected to remain stable at around 1¾% in the EU and 1½% in
the euro area over the forecast horizon, despite the fading impact of past
increases in indirect taxes and administered prices as well as the waning passthrough of energy price hikes. Headline inflation is expected to average 1.8%
in the EU and 1.6% in the euro area this year and to decline further to 1.7%
and 1.5% respectively in 2014.

Slower speed of
structural fiscal
consolidation

Fiscal consolidation is set to continue over the forecast horizon. As many
Member States are implementing sizeable fiscal measures, headline fiscal
deficits are projected to fall to 3.4% in the EU and 2.9% in the euro area in
2013. The pace of consolidation in structural terms is expected to slow down
compared to 2012. The structural deficit is expected to decrease from 2.8% in
2012 to 2.0% in 2013 in the EU, and from 2.1% to 1.4% in the euro area.
Under the customary no-policy-change assumption, the pace of consolidation
would slow down further in 2014. The focus of consolidation efforts is set to
shift to some extent from revenue-based consolidation towards a reduction in
expenditure over the forecast horizon. In light of the weak outlook for
economic activity, the debt-to GDP ratio is expected to increase to 91% in the
EU and 96% in the euro area by 2014.

Outlook still clouded
by high uncertainty

On the back of important policy decisions since last summer, perceived
redenomination risks have largely been dispelled. Yet, with uncertainty about
economic perspectives remaining high and a fragile macro-financial situation,
downside risks continue to largely prevail. In particular, the effective
implementation of adjustment measures and policies to strengthen the EMU
architecture remains crucial to prevent a return of stress in financial markets.
Other downside risks to GDP relate to the assumptions underlying this
forecast, in particular a slowdown in the necessary structural reform effort,
the possibility of a further appreciation of the euro exchange rate that could
hamper exports, or fiscal consolidation measures that are not embedded in
this forecast due to the no-policy-change assumption. The very high levels of
unemployment in some Member States could jeopardise social cohesion and
weigh on confidence more strongly and durably. Outside the EU, the absence
of a credible path to medium-term fiscal consolidation in the US and Japan
could weigh on financial market sentiment.
On the upside, the overall benign financial market situation or faster-thanexpected progress with adjustment and reforms could allow for an earlier
return of confidence and strengthen the recovery of domestic demand. On the

4

external side, global growth could prove more dynamic than expected due to
a stronger impact of recent expansionary measures. Risks to the inflation
outlook continue to be broadly balanced.

THE EU ECONOMY: ADJUSTMENT CONTINUES
The EU and the euro-area economy have been undergoing a protracted downturn which started in the
final quarter of 2011 and which is expected to have had a trough in early 2013. Following the easing of
financial market tensions since mid-2012 economic sentiment started to improve in the final quarter of
last year. But recent readings of survey indicators point to a rather gradual stabilisation of the EU
economy in the first half of this year and a beginning of the recovery only in the second half of 2013.
Based on the assumption that continued policy effort will sustain improvements in the economic
adjustment capacity and in financial markets, the EU economy is expected to move slowly out of
recession in the first half of 2013. Exports are likely to benefit from the projected gradual pick-up in
external demand over the forecast horizon and might also have some positive effects on private
investment. While improvements in financial markets are visible, they have not yet fed through to the
real economy. This disrupted macro-financial linkage is associated with financial fragmentation in the
EU due to various magnitudes of debt overhang in the private sector, including the banking sector, and
different macro-economic conditions. As a consequence, lending to the private sector in vulnerable
Member States appears to be particularly constrained. Therefore, the easing of credit conditions across
Member States, helped by on average low interest rates and progressing bank recapitalisations, remains
a crucial prerequisite for domestic demand to become a self-sustained contributor to GDP growth in the
course of the next quarters.
The outlook for the remainder of the year is predicated on diminishing uncertainty associated with a
further gradual improvement in business and consumer confidence, and projections point to a sluggish
return to moderate economic growth amid declining inflation pressures. Given the need for balancesheet adjustment in the public and private sector in several Member States, economic activity in the EU
is expected to remain subdued throughout the forecast horizon and marked by persistent cross-country
differences. On the back of a strong negative carry-over effect from 2012 and an expected weak first
half of this year, real GDP in the EU is set to decrease marginally in 2013, while it is predicted to
decline by ½% in the euro area. Looking ahead to 2014, real GDP is projected to expand by 1½% in the
EU and 1¼% in the euro area.
Headline inflation is set to decline further over the forecast horizon. The impact of past increases in
indirect taxes and commodity price hikes falls out of the annual comparison and weak economic activity
as well as bleak labour market prospects are likely to hold inflationary pressures in check. In 2012,
consumer prices in the EU and the euro area increased by 2.6% and 2.5% respectively and annual
HICP inflation is predicted to fall below 2% in both areas this year. In 2014, consumer-price inflation is
expected to average 1.7% in the EU and 1.5% in the euro area.
Perceived tail risks have decreased substantially since mid-2012, but risks to the growth outlook remain
skewed to the downside amid heightened uncertainty given recent policy events as well as the dire
labour market situation. The risks to the inflation outlook appear broadly balanced.

REVISITING A PROTRACTED BALANCESHEET RECESSION

constraints still exist and risk affecting economic
prospects.

The first quarter of 2013 is likely to have marked
the trough of a protracted balance-sheet
recession (1) that started at the end of 2011 and is
linked to the financial crisis and unsustainable debt
levels. The euro area entered its fifth quarter of
contraction, while the downturn in the EU was
only shortly interrupted in the third quarter of last
year. Balance-sheet recessions tend to be
characterised by deeper downturns as well as
shallower recoveries and are often associated with
substantial and permanent output losses. These
developments are also in line with empirical
evidence that stress the asymmetric impact of the
financial cycle on the real economy. (2) Moreover,
as potential output growth was overestimated in
the period prior to the financial crisis, the
subsequent adjustment and deleveraging imply that
long-term economic growth might not return to the
pre-recession growth trajectory (see Box I.1). (3)
Whereas cyclical headwinds are expected to
dissipate over the forecast horizon, balance-sheet
adjustments in the public and private sector are
likely to weigh on the economic outlook.

… but headwinds from deleveraging dynamics
and balance-sheet adjustment prevail …

The unsustainable accumulation of debt in the
private and public sector, combined with
uncertainty over the macroeconomic situation and
asset quality as well as adverse credit conditions,
has triggered substantial balance-sheet adjustments
in several Member States which are set to be
weighing on economic prospects over the forecast
horizon. (4) Corporate debt levels have started to
fall gradually since mid-2009, but weak economic
activity and its negative impact on corporate
profitability interrupted this decline in 2012.
Overall, companies' deleveraging efforts are
reflected in the net lending position of the EU
non-financial corporate sector since the final
quarter of 2009 (see Graph I.3). (5)

Financial markets appear more resilient …

Since mid-2012, stress in financial markets has
abated substantially due to fiscal and structural
reforms at the Member State level. The entering
into force of the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM) and the ECB's announcement of outright
monetary transactions (OMT) added up to
financial stability, alongside with the decision by
the European Council to create a Banking Union.
This was complemented by the completion of the
negotiations on a programme for Cyprus, and the
agreement on lengthening loan maturities for
Ireland and Portugal. But negative feedback loops

funding problems and government financing

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Box I.1: The impact of the crisis on potential output: Is the 2009 assessment still valid?
According to the initial assessment in spring
2009, (1) slow post-crisis adjustment and a longlasting deterioration in financing conditions was
expected to lead to a permanent level shift in euroarea GDP, while its growth dynamics would not be
affected in the long term. The present box
examines whether this initial prediction is still
valid.
In spring 2009, DG ECFIN assessed the
implications for potential output of the financial
crisis and used the official production function (PF)
methodology and the European Commission's
QUEST model to explore three very different
scenarios as to its likely evolution. One scenario
explored the possibility that the potential growth
rate would eventually return to its pre-crisis path,
and consequently the only permanent effect from
the crisis would be on the level of potential output
(scenario 1). A more optimistic "full recovery"
scenario was also considered possible if "lost"
growth could be fully recouped in future years
(scenario 2). Finally, a more pessimistic scenario
was evaluated, namely permanent growth rate
effects (scenario 3). In order to evaluate the
likelihood of one of these three scenarios actually
materialising, simulations were carried out with the
QUEST model which concluded that scenario 1
(permanent level effects) constituted the most
likely outcome of the crisis for the EU economy,
with a long run, cumulated, loss in the level of
potential output of around 5% of GDP.
Two key questions now arise in 2013, firstly, has
the evolution of actual and potential output over the
last four years fundamentally changed the 2009
assessment of the crisis and secondly what was the
real-time performance of the PF method in the preand post-crisis periods? To help answer these
questions, this box will look at the potential output
projections produced by the PF method for a
selection of the regular forecasts of the
Commission. In this regard, Graph 1 shows the
current assessment of the future path of potential
output in the euro area (based on the spring 2013
forecast) and compares it with alternative pre-crisis
(i.e. spring 2008 forecast) and post-crisis (spring
2009 forecast) potential output paths. This graph
shows that the real-time performance of the PF

growth and output gap estimates (Box I.3.2),

2009), 2009, No. 3, pp. 31-32.

method in the pre-crisis period was not very good
since the method produced a pre-crisis trend path
which pointed to the euro area having a roughly
zero output gap whereas subsequent revisions now
show a relatively large positive output gap in the
years preceding the crisis. However, Graph 1 also
shows that the real-time performance of the PF
method in the post-crisis period has so far been
very good, with the euro area continuing to track
the post-crisis potential output path produced using
the spring 2009 forecast.

If one compares the spring 2013 potential output
levels relative to the pre-crisis trend path, one can
see from Graph 1 that most of the effect of the
crisis has been structural in nature (with table 1
showing that this structural decline was mainly
driven by a much lower contribution from labour –
i.e. increases in structural unemployment and
slower growth in the population of working age –
and from weaker investment trends). Consequently,
the "full recovery" scenario is no longer credible.
On the basis of the evidence to date, the most likely
long-run outcome continues to be scenario 1, since
although the GDP loss is increasing over time,
which is consistent with scenario 3, the pre-crisis
trend growth path was predicated on an unrealistic
growth outlook for total factor productivity (TFP)
and was also exaggerated by the pre-crisis boom
conditions in some euro-area economies. Finally,
whilst the method points to a relatively sluggish
short- to medium-term trend growth path, it
predicts a more optimistic longer-term outlook,
underpinned by the Non-Accelerating Wage Rates
of Unemployment (NAWRU) returning to their
structural levels, investment (after the deleveraging
phase) going back to rates driven by fundamentals
and TFP gaining from restructuring efforts.

What conclusions can be drawn from the
operation of the Production Function (PF)
method in the pre- and post-crisis periods?

Given that the method was clearly too optimistic
regarding pre-crisis potential growth rate
projections, an important question for policy
makers at the present time is whether the PF
method is likely to lead to the opposite problem in
the "bust" phase of the cycle i.e. producing
excessively pessimistic projections, especially
when it is applied to economies which are
undergoing substantial economic adjustment
programmes. Whilst it is impossible to
unequivocally answer this question given the
uncertainties involved, it is clear that the success or
failure of the method in evaluating potential output
trends in the adjustment economies will to a large
extent depend on its ability to accurately assess the
future structural unemployment (NAWRU),
investment and trend TFP paths for these countries.
Regarding unemployment trends, for those
countries currently experiencing large increases in
their NAWRUs, it needs to be emphasised that
there is a significant difference between these,
medium-run NAWRU increases and the long-run
structural
unemployment
rates
of
these
economies. (2) The NAWRU is affected by labour
market adjustment frictions, such as real wage
rigidities and sectoral and skill mismatches arising
after large shocks, whereas the long-run (i.e. T+10)
structural unemployment rate is driven by structural
rigidities linked to the institutional features of
labour markets, such as, for example, the
generosity of unemployment benefit systems or the
level of labour taxation. Currently, high NAWRUs
in the adjustment economies reflect the
combination of large negative shocks coupled with
underlying price- and wage-adjustment rigidities,
with these economies eventually returning to their

determinants in the EU countries, European Economy

lower,

structural

Regarding investment, since the capital stock is an
indicator of overall capacity in an economy and
since net investment in any given year is only a tiny
fraction of the overall capital stock figures, the PF
method does not smooth this series. This approach
is soundly based since the method's agreed
definition for potential is the amount of output
which could be produced if all factors of
production were utilised at average or normal
capacity rates. Using this definition of capital, the
method does not correct for possible deviations of
the capital stock from its long-run trend level due,
for example, to an asset bubble. The method does
however fully take into account the slowdown in
post-boom potential capital growth because of low
investment rates. In addition, the method has the
property that the investment rate returns to average
sample levels over the medium term (an important
assumption for crisis economies) and consequently
will pick up the normalisation of investment after
the boom-bust cycle.
In overall terms, therefore, the big weakness of the
method with respect to investment is in the boom,
not the bust, phase of cycles. Since there is no
breakdown of the investment-to-GDP ratio into a
structural and cyclical component, there is always
the risk that the method will over- or underestimate potential, especially in extreme asset
driven, rather than income driven, cycles. To help
alleviate this risk, a type of structural model of
investment has been introduced in the (T+10)
methodology which establishes an explicit link
between investment and its fundamental, long-run
determinants, namely changes in trend labour
supply and trend TFP. Whilst this more structural
approach will help anchor long-run investment
trends, there is still no mechanism in place for the
short to medium term (i.e. up to T+5) which could
help alleviate the type of problems provoked by the
asset boom experienced in the pre-crisis period. In
this context, new research has been carried out by
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) which
aims to use information about the financial cycle
(real interest rates, credit growth and property
prices) to produce "finance-neutral" output gaps. (3)
Whilst including the BIS approach directly in the

PF method appears somewhat problematic, (4) it
could serve as a useful complement to the current
approach. (5) More specifically, financial market
variables could be effectively used as a type of
"early warning" signal of bubbles in capital
formation (i.e. large cyclical deviations relative to
the long-run trend level for the capital stock) or
alternatively as a signalling mechanism for
abnormally low levels of capital accumulation in
the bust phase.
Finally, in terms of TFP, fundamental problems in
the application of the Kalman Filter (KF)
methodology to the extraction of trend TFP in the
adjustment economies are not expected, with the
method already picking up encouraging signs of
TFP improvements in some of these countries. It is
widely accepted that the KF method (since it
exploits the link between the TFP cycle and the
degree of capacity utilisation in the economy)
produces a more realistic pattern for short- and
(4)

(5)

Including the BIS approach directly in the PF method
does not seem sensible at the current juncture since,
on the basis of the BIS results, the approach could
lead to too many "false alarms" / "inconsistent
signals" (e.g. at what point should policy makers get
concerned about the growing share of credit as a
percentage of GDP or of rising house prices) and, in
addition, it produces implausibly small, and rapidly
closing, output gaps in the post-crisis period. In terms
of the selection of variables used by the BIS and their
treatment as cyclical versus structural indicators,
there is no distinction made in the BIS analysis
between the impact these indicators are having on
both the cycle and on potential – everything is
attributed to the cycle. This is a questionable
approach since the financial market variables used
are affecting both the cycle and the trend. Finally,
whilst in general not having revisions is a good thing,
the observation of having only small revisions for
finance-neutral output gap estimates may not
necessarily suggest a good real-time performance
since it could be indicative of having missed
important signals.
In combination with the other cyclical indicators used
in the PF method, such as capacity utilisation and the
change in the growth rate of nominal unit labour
costs, the inclusion of financial market variables
would boost the overall information set of policy
makers on the cyclical drivers of growth.

medium-term trend TFP developments compared
with the previously used Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
filter approach. Consequently, it results in
relatively stable trend TFP forecasts, with
significantly smaller revisions to output gaps. (6)
To conclude, despite the problems with the method
in the pre-crisis period (especially its inability to
detect the investment bubbles which were driving
positive output gaps in many countries), this review
suggests that the real-time, post-crisis performance
of the PF methodology was relatively good. In
addition, the method's 2009 prediction of a subdued
recovery process following the financial crisis was
largely borne out by subsequent economic
developments. In overall terms therefore, DG
ECFIN's 2009 assessment of the impact of the
crisis remains valid, with the empirical evidence
over the last four years being consistent with the
potential output growth path predicted by the
official spring 2009 forecast. Based on
developments over the last four years, one can
conclude that the most likely long-run impact of the
crisis will be to produce permanent losses in the
level of the euro area's output of roughly 5%, with
no long-run effect on potential growth rates.

prior to the global financial crisis. However,
household debt in the euro area, largely in the form
of mortgage loans, has hardly changed since 2010
and has thus remained at elevated levels. With the
prevailing need for both the household and
corporate sector to repair balance sheets on a large
scale, while, at the same time, governments are
reining in deficits and reducing unsustainable
public debt levels, growth in domestic demand is

States. As a result of the expected further decline
in borrowing of the total economy induced by
necessary deleveraging net lending positions of the
total EU and euro-area economy are forecast to
widen over the forecast horizon. Given the
substantial economy-wide need to reduce debt
levels, balance-sheet adjustment is expected to
weigh on domestic demand over the forecast
horizon and the return to a self-sustained recovery
is likely to be a time-consuming process. (7)

Despite the decisive political achievements in
terms of crisis-management and institutional
reforms of the economic governance in the euroarea, uncertainty remains elevated. However,
financial markets appear to have become less
sensitive to adverse policy news from vulnerable
countries and the observed relative calmness
during and after the programme negotiations in
Cyprus may lend support to the hypothesis that the
available policy instruments for crisis management
have proved effective so far.

Therefore, this forecast maintains the assumption
that continued policy reforms at the EU and
Member-State level will be implemented timely
and rigorously, thus sustaining financial market
improvements and the economic adjustment in
Member States.

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

Having closed the year on a subdued tone world
GDP growth in 2012 averaged 3.0%, down from
4.2% in 2011. However, recent survey data
indicate a gradual improvement of the global
economic outlook. The composite global PMI
index signals an expansion in global output for the
first quarter of the year, supported both by
manufacturing and services (see Graph I.4). The
underlying momentum in emerging market
economies and several non-EU advanced
economies, notably the US, has remained
relatively strong (see Table I.1). Together with the
expected positive effects of important policy
actions taken by governments and central banks,
these developments are likely to compensate for
the negative carry-over from the last quarter of
2012. Therefore, the forecast for non-EU growth at
4% and 4½% for 2013 and 2014 respectively
remains in line with the winter forecast.

See ECB, Monthly Bulletin, July 2012, pp. 13-15.

Against the background of a gradual global
recovery, the projections for non-EU trade remain
unchanged compared to the winter forecast with
expansion rates expected at 4½% and 6% for 2013
and 2014 respectively.
Global growth bolstered by robust expansion
in emerging markets …

Emerging market economies continued to be the
main drivers of world output growth (see
Graph I.5). However, the country-specific growth
performances have been rather diverse reflecting
the differentiated impact of the global slowdown
on individual economies as well as the stance of
macroeconomic policies and country-specific
structural weaknesses. In particular, emerging
markets with rather close links to the EU economy
slowed down significantly in 2012, notably CIS
members including Russia. Economic activity has
also been comparatively subdued in the western
hemisphere, while output growth held up
comparatively well in Asia and latest data suggest
that Asian industrial production continued to
expand at high rates at the beginning of the year.
However, recent data releases underpin the view
that China's economic recovery is rather modest
compared to past performance. Output in emerging

Economic developments at the aggregated level

market economies as a whole is forecast to
increase by 5¼% in 2013 and by 5½% in 2014.

.… while global inflation is easing further
despite accommodative monetary policies.

Among non-EU advanced countries, the US
economy remained on a steady recovery path
throughout most of 2012, supported by a gradually
strengthening domestic economy with solid job
creation and an improving housing market.
Recovering from the triple disaster of 2011, real
GDP in Japan expanded relatively strongly in early
2012, before economic activity slowed down
sharply in the remainder of the year. But economic
activity is expected to be stimulated by
expansionary policy measures over the forecast
horizon. Looking ahead, advanced economies
outside the EU are expected to expand by 2% this
year and by 2½% in 2014.

The recent fall in energy and commodity prices
reflected less optimism for the global economic
outlook, but is likely to help contain worldwide
inflationary pressures. Global inflation is expected
to remain close to 3% over the forecast horizon,
with core inflation at low levels in most non-EU
economies. However, most BRICS countries are
still prone to relatively high inflation rates. While
Russia, South Africa and India are still struggling
to contain price pressures, asset-price inflation has
appeared to be a potential risk in China over the
medium term given latest data on credit growth.
Regarding advanced economies, the extended
period of sustained subpar global growth has
prompted central banks to extend unconventional
measures and the policy stance is set to become yet
more accommodative after the Bank of Japan's
decision to almost double the monetary base in the
next two years. For the time being however,
inflation expectations in advanced economies
appear well anchored over the medium term, while
input-price inflation eased to an eight-month low
in March 2013, according to PMI data.

outlook. Based on a positive supply-demand
balance, oil prices are assumed to average
USD 104.9/bbl in 2013 and decline to
USD 99.2/bbl in 2014. (8) Due to a sluggish

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN EUROPE
0

Financial market conditions in the EU have
remained relatively favourable despite adverse
macro-economic developments and episodes of
political uncertainty. The lasting impact of the
ECB's OMTs and progress with respect to the
creation of a banking union has markedly reduced
perceived tail risks for the euro area. Moreover, the
expectation and subsequently the implementation
of additional quantitative easing measures by the
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan stimulated
international financial markets and led investors to
acquire riskier asset in a search for yield.
Financial markets appear less sensitive to
adverse policy news …

Since the end of February, weaker-than-expected
economic data and higher political and financial
sector uncertainty in some Member States have
weighed on market sentiment, although a
resurgence of tensions comparable to those
encountered in 2012 has not materialised. EU
sovereign-yield spreads to the German Bund have
remained broadly unchanged since the start of the
year (see Graph I.6).
However, benchmark yields in the euro area, and
also in the US and the UK, have declined, which is
also likely to be the result of increased capital
inflows from Japan. Equity markets in the EU have
receded slightly and corporate bond spreads have
widened moderately. Moreover, perceived risks to
the banking sector have increased lately. In
particular, the Cypriot adjustment programme
including investor bail-ins fuelled uncertainty
about the EU banking resolution regime. As a
result, bank share valuations declined and CDS
spreads of senior bank bonds widened
significantly.

… and bank funding stress is easing on the
back of an accommodative monetary policy
…

The monetary policy stance has remained
accommodative throughout the EU. The Bank of
England maintained its official Bank Rate at 0.5%
and the size of its quantitative easing
programme, (9) while the Riksbank left the repo
rate unchanged at 1.0% and expects to keep it at
this level until the second half of 2014. The ECB
kept policy rates at record-low levels amid
contained inflation pressures (the main refinancing
rate stands at 0.75% and the deposit rate at zero).
Euro-area money-market rates increased at the end
of January on the back of higher-than-expected
LTRO (Longer-term refinancing operation) (10)
repayments signalling easing funding strains, but
fell back until March as the pace of LTRO
repayments slowed significantly. In the banking
sector, the usage of central bank funding remains
high and turnover on overnight money markets is
subdued, in particular in longer maturities. (11)
Nevertheless, a more broad-based improvement in
bank funding conditions has become visible also in
vulnerable Member States, reflected by the partial

In April, the BoE Monetary Policy Committee voted to
maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the

Banks' profitability and solvability remain closely
linked to the economic outlook, although some
improvement has been achieved, primarily by
portfolio optimisation and the reduction of riskweighted assets due to deleveraging and, to a
lesser extent, raising capital through retained
earnings. (12)

… but banks' improved financing conditions
are not reflected in credit growth …

Data on credit flows and credit standards suggest
that banks' improved funding conditions have so
far not translated into increasing credit supply and
an easing of lending conditions across countries.
This is not least a reflection of the different
macroeconomic conditions and the balance-sheet
adjustment after the past high credit growth in
several Member States which now also impacts on
credit demand. The transmission of the ECB’s
monetary policy to the real economy in some
Member States continues to be hindered by banks'
elevated risk aversion and deleveraging
pressures. (13) The relatively high level of debt
securities issuance by non-financial corporations
(annual growth rate at 12.0% in February) points
to a gradual shift from bank credit to market-based
financing by corporations that have direct access to
capital markets. Bank lending to the euro-area
private sector shrank over the first months of this
year (see Graph I.7). The latest ECB data for
February point to an annual growth of credit of 0.4% y-o-y (data adjusted for sales and
securitisation). Lending volumes to the nonfinancial corporate sector continued to be
particularly weak (-1.4% y-o-y), while the annual
growth of loans to households remained slightly
positive (0.4% y-o-y) supported by the lending for
house purchases.
(12)

(13)

However, bank bond issuance has recently been affected by
mounting investor concerns related to potential future bailins, whereas the internal funding potential of financial
institutions remains subdued due to a combination of
macro-economic headwinds and regulatory adjustments.
See e.g. Aristei, D. and M. Gallo, Interest rate pass-through
in the euro area during the financial crisis: A multivariate
regime-switching approach, Quaderni del dipartimento di
economia, finanza e statistica, No. 107, October 2012.

Loans to households
Loans to non-financial corporations

These developments are in line with recent bank
lending surveys that point to balance-sheet
constraints as well as borrowers' risks and
macroeconomic uncertainty as major reasons for
bank's net tightening of credit standards. But
subdued credit flows are also likely the result of
the ongoing deleveraging in the non-financial
corporate sector and among private households.
However, growth in lending to non-financial
corporations
continued
to
display
wide
heterogeneity across euro-area Member States with
France and Germany maintaining credit growth
rates slightly above zero, while for example Italy
and particularly Spain were recording significant
declines in lending.
… as credit markets remain fragmented.

The heterogeneity among euro-area countries'
financial conditions is reflected by the crosscountry variability of interest rates on loans to the
private sector. Interest rates on loans to nonfinancial corporations were significantly higher in
Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal than in the euro
area on average and the dispersion among interest
rates across Member States has reached historical
proportions at the current juncture (see Graph I.8).
A similar pattern is reflected by DG ECFIN's
composite financing cost index, a broader measure
of non-financial corporations' financing costs.
However, for the euro area as a whole, average
interest rates continued to decline over the past few
months driven by Germany and France.

High bank lending rates are particularly
detrimental to small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) which lack direct access to capital markets
and depend largely on bank financing for
investment funding. Alongside cross-country
differences in lending conditions, funding costs
appear to exacerbate with smaller firm size. In
particular, the interest-rate spread between loans to
small and large companies, here proxied by the
spread between interest-rates on low-volume and
high-volume loans, shows a visible upward trend
since the end of 2011 (see Graph I.9). Even though
borrowing for SMEs often tends to be more costly,
inter alia due to higher risk premia, (14) lending
rates for SMEs in vulnerable Member States have
reached levels close to those in 2008.

THE EU ECONOMY

The year 2012 ended on a negative note. In the
EU, real GDP contracted by 0.5% q-o-q in the
(14)

18

fourth quarter, while output in the euro area
declined by 0.6%. Thus, economic activity has
shrunk almost continuously in both areas since the
fourth quarter of 2011, with the euro area
recording five consecutive quarters of negative
growth. For the year 2012 as a whole, economic
activity decreased by 0.3% in the EU and by 0.6%
in the euro area. The weak outcome in 2012
implies a negative carry-over which subtracts
0.4 pp. and 0.5 pp. from economic growth in the
EU and in the euro area respectively in 2013.

In general, SMEs do not have a credit rating which makes
banks' assessment of SMEs' creditworthiness more costly.

Based on the assumption that firm policy
implementation sustains improvements in financial
markets and a renewed intensification of the
sovereign-debt crisis is avoided, economic activity
in the EU and the euro area is expected to stabilise
slowly in the first half of 2013. The outlook is
predicated on the global recovery gaining traction
and the gradual easing of financing conditions in
vulnerable Member States. Supported by the
accommodative monetary policy stance which
allows for very benign financing conditions in the
EU on average, substantial bank recapitalisation
efforts in some countries are expected to
counteract financial fragmentation.
Diminishing uncertainty associated with an
improvement in business and consumer confidence
is likely to unlock investment spending and allow
real GDP to start expanding gradually later in
2013. However, policy uncertainties remain
elevated and have the potential to partly undo the
improvements in financial markets and confidence
achieved since mid-2012. Thus, the economic
outlook remains fragile and the prospective
recovery depends to a large extent on the
credibility and effective implementation of
announced policy measures.
… with domestic
throughout 2013 …

headwinds

persisting

In March, the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI)
and the PMI Composite Output Index decreased in
both the EU and the euro area, putting on hold the
improvement in confidence that had started in the
final quarter of last year. However, both survey
indicators suggest an easing in the pace of
contraction in both areas in the first quarter of
2013 compared to late 2012 (see Graph I.10).

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Box I.2: The accuracy of forecasts during the crisis years
Macroeconomic forecasts are widely used as a
basis for economic policy analysis and decisionmaking. This calls for a regular assessment of the
forecast accuracy. Accordingly, the Commission's
forecasting performance was first examined by
Keereman in 1999, with an update carried out by
Melander et al. in 2007. (1) Both studies concluded
that the Commission's forecasts "dispose a
reasonable track record".
The macroeconomic environment has, however,
changed considerably since the 2007 update. The
euro-area and EU economies entered the Great
Recession of 2008-09. Consequently, and
notwithstanding the exceptional nature of the crisis,
forecast errors are likely to have increased during
that period. They also raise the question as to the
impact of the business cycle on forecasting
performance.

Results of accuracy tests

The results for current-year forecasts up to 2012 (4)
show that the forecast error – as measured by the
mean absolute error (MAE) – is 0.5 pp. for the EU
and 0.4 pp. for the euro area. (5) This means that the
Commission's forecast for EU real GDP growth
has, on average, proven to be half a percentage
point too high / low for the current year. Overall,
the extension of the initial observation period (up to
2007) to 2012 has a relatively limited effect on the
forecast error for the current year. (6) While the
MAE remains unchanged for the EU, it has only
increased slightly (+0.03 pp.) for the euro area. The
forecast accuracy also remains largely unchanged
for most Member States.

MAE (1970-2012)

In contrast, extending the observation period to
2012, leads to a significant deterioration in
forecasting performance for the year-ahead
outlook. As can be seen from Graph 1, the forecast
errors for GDP exhibit a sharp increase, at both the
aggregate (+0.10 pp. for the EU and +0.34 pp. for
the euro area) and the Member-State level. The

Current-year forecasts are the one in spring, whereas
year-ahead forecasts come from the autumn
forecasts. Current-year forecasts are assessed against
the so-called 'first available estimates' presented in
the spring forecast of the subsequent year. Yearahead forecasts are assessed against the so-called
'first settled estimates' presented in the autumn
forecast following the year to be forecast.
The mean absolute error (MAE) is the absolute
difference between the average forecast and the
average outturn. Negative errors are treated as
positive ones so that errors cannot cancel each other
out. The MAE is thus a more accurate measure of the
average forecast error than a simple mean error.
For the realisations of 2012, the 'first available
estimates' are used for the year-ahead forecast as the
'first settled estimates' are not yet available.

deterioration mainly stems from the sizeable
forecast errors in the recession year 2009, which

crisis.

The impact of the business cycle on accuracy

Forecast accuracy can be shown to depend on the
cyclical position with forecast errors being
typically larger in and around economic
recessions. (7) The MAE for the current-year
outlook for the EU is almost twice as high when the
economy is in recession than when it is not. The
difference is larger for year-ahead forecasts, for
instance the MAE for the EU is almost 3 times
larger during recessions. The picture at Member
State level is broadly similar (see Graph 2).

Comparison with other forecasters

In order to compare the track record of the
Commission with that of the OECD, IMF, and
Consensus, similar observation periods have been
looked at (broadly since 1990). Commission yearahead forecasts are found to score better than those
released by Consensus and the IMF (Graph 4),
which may partly reflect informational differences
(the IMF issues its forecasts earlier). In contrast,
the Commission's forecasts do not perform as well
as those of the OECD, which could also be related
to timing issues as the OECD releases its forecast
on average one month later.

pps.

One reason for the poorer forecasting performance
in recessions is the difficulty in predicting turning
points. Another is that GDP forecasts tend to be
overly optimistic in a recessionary environment.
Nonetheless, the Commission's forecasting
performance during recessions has generally
improved over time, at least for the current-year
outlook for the EU (see Graph 3) and larger
Member States. For the year-ahead forecasts, the
errors for 2009 suggest the opposite. These errors
for the EU and the larger Member States are
broadly of the same order of magnitude as those of
the 1975 recession, which in terms of output losses
is the closest to the 2008-09 recession.

The term recession covers the years 1974-1975,
1980-1982, 1992-1993, 2001, 2003, 2008-2009 and
2011 to date. These broadly correspond to the periods
of recession and slow growth identified by the Centre
for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) for the euro
area. For consistency, this definition is used as a
proxy for recessionary periods in the UK, DK, SE
and the EU.

Limiting the observation sample to the period since
the beginning of the crisis (2008) shows a

Commission still scoring better than the IMF and
Consensus but worse than the OECD. All in all, it
appears that the Commission forecasts continue to
dispose a reasonable track record.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Industrial production in the euro area and the EU
was roughly stable in the first two months of the
year, compared to the final quarter of 2012 when it
decreased by around 2% in both areas. However,
the most recent weakness is likely to have
continued in April, as indicated by the Flash
Eurozone PMI. The index was unchanged but it
still signalled a fall in economic activity, notably
in manufacturing. As a result, the stabilisation
forecast for the first half of 2013 is expected to be
rather gradual and more protracted than previously
expected (see also Box I.2 on forecast accuracy).

ongoing deleveraging in the private and public
sector as well as heightened uncertainty will
continue to weigh on domestic demand,
particularly in the first half of 2013. By contrast,
exports are set to benefit from the expected
strengthening in global demand and are predicted
to remain the main growth driver throughout this
year.
… but gradually dissipating and leading the
way to subdued growth in 2014 …

Looking ahead to 2014, real GDP is projected to
expand by a moderate 1½% in the EU and 1¼%
the euro area, as some domestic headwinds are set
to dissipate. Domestic demand should take over
from net exports as the main contributor to GDP
growth as investment is expected to benefit from
restored business sentiment and the assumed
easing in financing conditions in vulnerable
Member States (see Graph I.11). Higher consumer
confidence and rising purchasing power due to
further abating inflation is likely to help raising
household consumption. In 2014, consumer
spending is expected to be additionally supported
by the first signs of improving labour market
conditions on the back of structural reforms that
should also begin to impact on the EU economy.
However, the need for balance-sheet adjustment in
the public and private sector in several Member
States will continue to weigh on economic activity
over the forecast horizon (see also Table I.2
and I.3).

On the back of a strong negative carry-over effect

… while growth differentials are likely to remain
pronounced.

Not least due to persistent adjustment and
deleveraging needs in vulnerable Member States
differentials in GDP growth across countries are
projected to remain pronounced over the forecast
horizon. In particular, the large divergence in the
labour market performance across countries that
started to become visible after the recession of
2008-09 is also likely to determine future
employment prospects and the strength and pace of
the projected country-specific recovery. However,
most of the Member States that are currently in
recession are expected to return to positive
quarterly GDP growth this year.

22

Contrary to previous quarters, net exports did not
cushion the contraction in economic activity at the
end of 2012. Amid a weak global environment,
exports declined by 0.9% q-o-q in the EU and by
0.8% q-o-q in the euro area, falling for the first
time since mid-2009. Compared to the previous
year, export growth at 2.3% and 2.7% more than
halved in both the EU and euro area respectively in
2012.
New export orders point to a brightening shortterm outlook for EU external trade. Therefore,
export growth is expected to rebound moderately
in the first quarter of 2013. With the expected
gradual pick-up in global activity and foreign
demand, export growth is expected to increase
further in the second half of 2013. However, due to
the weak performance in the last quarter of 2012
and early 2013, and also dampened by the past
appreciation of the euro, export growth has been
revised downward compared to the winter forecast.
For 2013 as a whole, exports of goods and services
are set to grow by 2% in the EU and 2¼% in the
euro area. In line with global demand
developments, export growth is set to accelerate to
roughly 5% in both areas in 2014 (see Graph I.12).

On the import side, weak domestic demand
continues to act as a drag on import growth. In the
last quarter of 2012, imports contracted by 0.3% in
the EU and by 0.9% in the euro area and the shortterm prospects for EU imports are likely to be
subdued. In 2013, import growth is expected to
resume but to remain relatively muted, with import
volumes expected to grow by ¾% in the EU and
by about ½% in the euro area. As the recovery of
domestic demand gains foothold in 2014, imports
are forecast to accelerate correspondingly and
expand by around 4½% in the EU and by 4¾% in
the euro area.
Overall, net exports are expected to remain the
predominant growth driver in 2013. Over the
forecast horizon, their positive contribution to real
GDP growth is likely to diminish in comparison
with domestic demand.
Gross fixed capital formation set to rebound in
second half of 2013 …

In the fourth quarter of 2012, mirroring broadbased contractions in the largest Member States,
gross fixed capital formation in the EU and the
euro area continued to decline. In 2012, total
investment shrank by 2.8% in the EU and 4.1% in
the euro area, as it was adversely affected by
subdued final demand, ongoing balance-sheet
adjustment, high uncertainty and constrained credit
supply to non-financial corporations in some
Member States.

… helped by

a

recovery

in equipment

The contraction in equipment investment
accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2012 and shortterm indicators suggest that non-construction
investment will shrink further, although at a slower
pace than observed at the end of 2012. Amid
relatively low capacity utilisation rates industrial
production of capital goods in the first two months
of 2013 was on average ½% lower than the level in
the final quarter of 2012 in both the EU and the
euro area. This negative short-term outlook is
corroborated by latest readings of the European
Commission’s industrial confidence indicator and
Markit's manufacturing PMI that remained well
below its long-term average and the expansion
threshold respectively. Moreover, bank lending to
non-financial corporations decreased in the euro
area at the end of 2012 and has further weakened
in the first two months of 2013.
After a weak first half of 2013, equipment
investment is forecast to rebound in the second
half of the year. It should first benefit from
increasing external demand and strengthening
business confidence as uncertainty eases. In annual
terms however, equipment investment is forecast
to decline in the EU and the euro area in 2013 and
to increase in both regions only in 2014 (see
Graph I.13).

At the current juncture, the level of total private
investment falls even short of the trough reached

… whereas housing market adjustment is still
weighing on capital spending.

As a result of the continued adjustment in some
Member States' housing markets and the overall
weak economic situation, investment in
construction declined by 3.1% in the EU and by
4.1% in the euro area in 2012. Leading supply
indicators, such as building permits, signal a
further decline in construction activity in the short
term. Production in construction weakened in the
first two months of 2013 and the Commission's
construction confidence indicator is still below its
long-term average. Weak growth in disposable
income, low consumer confidence and further
adjustments in housing markets, as signalled by
falling house prices in some countries, will
continue weighing on residential investment in
2013, while the government component in
construction investment is also likely to remain
subdued. Overall, construction investment is
forecast to shrink further in 2013 in both the EU
and the euro area, before a moderate pick-up is
expected in both areas in 2014.
Overall, private investment is forecast to rebound
in the second half of 2013 benefiting from higher
export growth, low financing costs, increasing
profit margins and gradually fading uncertainty
about business prospects. Public investment is
expected to remain subdued, albeit to a lessening
degree under the no-policy-change assumption. By
contrast, the scope for further destocking seems to
be rather limited in the coming quarters. (15) In
2013 as a whole, gross fixed capital formation is
set to contract by 1¾% in the EU and by about
2½% in the euro area. In 2014, total investment is
expected to increase by 2½% in the EU and by
2¼% in the euro area.
Private consumption to remain lacklustre

Private consumption in both the EU and the euro
area declined further in the last quarter of 2012,
continuing the downward trend seen over the last
year. This development reflected a sharp decrease
in real disposable income, but also the overall low
levels of consumer confidence. In 2012, household
consumption contracted by 0.7% in the EU and by
1.3% in the euro area (see Graph I.14).
Regarding short-term dynamics, soft and hard data
provide a mixed picture. Survey indicators suggest

This view is corroborated by the results of Commission
surveys according to which companies stocks are
considered to be below their long-term average.

subdued prospects for private consumption in the
near future. Although consumer confidence has
recently improved, its current level still remains
below its long-term average and confidence in the
retail sector deteriorated in the first quarter of
2013, according to commission surveys and PMI
data. However, the average level of EU retail sales
in January/February stood 0.5% (0.3% in the euro
area) above the level recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2012.

Consumer confidence (rhs)

With the household saving rate broadly at its longterm average but the need for households in some
Member States to deleverage further, there is little
scope for reducing savings significantly in order to
smooth consumption. On the contrary, the weak
prospects of the labour market and the still high
uncertainty may rather lead to an increase in
precautionary savings in the short term. Thus,
private consumption is expected to decline further
in the first half of 2013 and then stabilise during
the second half of the year. In 2013 as a whole,
private consumption is forecast to fall by ½% in
the EU and by 1% in the euro area. As regards
public consumption in 2013, it is projected to
increase slightly in the EU but to remain
unchanged in the euro area.
Looking further ahead to 2014, private
consumption is expected to pick up by around 1%
in the EU and by ¾% in the euro area as
headwinds start easing and the return of
confidence further materialises. In particular, the
moderation in HICP inflation and the expected
timid improvements in labour market conditions in
the course of 2014 are likely to lift households' real
disposable incomes. Public consumption is
forecast to grow by ½% in both the euro area and
the EU, albeit under the no-policy-change
assumption.

In 2012, the current-account balance (in adjusted
terms) turned visibly positive in both the EU and
the euro area on the back of an improving
merchandise trade balance. This improvement is
reflected in a better export performance in most
vulnerable Member States supported by gains in
competiveness due to lower unit labour costs (see
Box I.3). This development is likely to continue in
2013, as non-EU external demand is predicted to
accelerate gradually and achieved improvements in
competitiveness are expected to be sustained (see

By contrast, robust wage growth in some Member
States with persistent current-account surpluses is
expected to support private consumption and is
thus likely to contribute to some extent to overall
rebalancing within the euro area.
No trend reversal in labour markets in 2013 …

The labour market conditions in the EU and the
euro area have continued worsening since the end
of 2012 on the back of weak economic activity and
ongoing labour market adjustments in several
euro-area Member States. Joblessness has steadily
increased in the last two years, with the
unemployment rate in February registering new
all-time highs in both the euro area (12.0%) and
the EU (10.9%). At the same time, the divergence
in the labour market performance across Member
States has reached an unprecedented magnitude.

likely to decline further over the forecast horizon,
reversing the past trend of eroding price

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2013

Box I.3: Labour costs, margins and prices in rebalancing economies
A number of euro-area economies, which
accumulated competitiveness gaps for several
years, are in a process of rebalancing. This
concerns Ireland, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal,
Slovenia, and, to some extent, Italy. Their losses in
competitiveness have been well documented and
can be illustrated by their large current-account
deficits, fast increases in unit labour costs (ULC) in
both the public and private sector and relatively
high inflation rates until the crisis. However, there
are many differences among the above mentioned
countries. Notably, while the current-account
deficits peaked at, or above, 10% of GDP in Spain,
Cyprus and Portugal, and even reached 18% in
Greece, the deficits were at around 6% in Ireland
and Slovenia in 2007-08. By 2012, the deficits had
declined to close to 5% of GDP in Greece and
Cyprus, below 2% in Spain and Portugal and had
turned into substantial surpluses in Ireland and
Slovenia.
Since 2008, there has been a reduction (or a clear
deceleration) in the ULC of these countries, in
absolute terms or relative to their main trading
partners. Key reasons were the cyclical increase in
unemployment but also a number of labour market
reforms. However, there has been the perception
that the reduction in labour costs had only partially
been reflected in prices. This box discusses the link
between ULC, profit margins and prices in the
context of rebalancing economies. It argues that,
for tradable sectors, an incomplete pass-through
from labour costs to prices is part of the
rebalancing process. However, the partial
absorption of the reduction in labour costs by the
firms' unit operating surpluses in the non-tradable
sectors suggests scope for increasing competition in
those sectors.
Labour costs and prices before and after the
crisis

Graph 1 shows the evolution of ULC in the whole
economy for each of the vulnerable countries and
the euro area as a whole since 2000. A first
observation is that changes in ULC have been
much different among these economies on account
of different wage, employment and productivity
developments. Focusing on the most recent years,
Ireland has recorded a rather steep fall in ULC and
this is still expected to continue through 2014,
while the reduction in ULC started later and has
been smaller in Greece, Spain and Portugal. There

has only been a stabilisation of ULC in Cyprus and
Slovenia. (1)

Regarding price developments, it is noteworthy
that, firstly, the trend of higher inflation rates in the
vulnerable countries as a whole compared with the
euro-area average came to an end in 2009.
However, it was only in a few occasions (Ireland in
2008-09, Portugal in 2009 and more recently in
Greece) that a general reduction in the price level
was observed (Graph 2). Secondly, before 2009
inflation differentials between vulnerable countries
and the euro-area average mainly concerned
services, which could be partially related to
Balassa-Samuelson effects. These differences have
disappeared (Graph 3). For goods, the differences
in inflation rates between these countries and the
euro-area aggregate have always been much
smaller. Differences in inflation for goods and
services have been explained by differences in
productivity, but mainly by differences in
competition faced by goods producers and service
providers: most goods are tradable, while most
services are not, or only to a limited extent, and
margins in services are more likely to reflect
monopolistic rents. Thirdly, looking at the most
recent period, Graph 4 shows that a substantial part
of price increases has been related to indirect tax
hikes, as illustrated by the difference between the
overall HICP and HICP at constant taxes. This
needs to be considered when the link between
labour costs and prices is analysed. However,
overall, there has been some asymmetry between

exporting capacity. Without an increase in the
exporting capacity and investment in tradable
sector, the correction in external imbalances would
solely occur through a reduction in imports,
resulting from a compression of domestic demand,
associated with an increase in unemployment and a
reduction in disposable income and standards of
living. As resources are allocated by their
respective remuneration, the rebalancing and the
creation of investment opportunities in the tradable
sector require an increase in the remuneration of
capital (and labour) in these sectors relative to the
non-tradable sector. For this to happen, part of the
reduction in labour costs will be absorbed by the
operating margins in tradables.
To isolate the impact of labour costs on prices it is
preferable to focus on value-added deflators of
each sector, rather than on final prices to remove
the effect of indirect taxes and other costs. Graphs
5 and 6 plot ULC and deflators in the euro-area
economies in tradables and non-tradables, during
the period before and after the onset of the crisis.
The two graphs illustrate how deflators for
tradables have remained much more stable and less
reactive to ULC, (2) as most firms in tradables are
price-takers. Therefore, one part of the ULC cuts
has been absorbed by changes in operating
margins. In contrast, deflators for non-tradables
have been much more responsive to developments
in labour costs, not only in the vulnerable
economies, but also in other economies.
The relatively small reduction in deflators in the
tradable sector (or in export deflators) is consistent
with the need for increasing the export market
shares of the vulnerable countries given their
relatively high export elasticities (3) and the pricing
strategies of exporters. This is also in line with
evidence in the literature that the pass-through from

Rebalancing and prices in tradables and nontradables

A growth-friendly rebalancing consists in a shift of
resources from non-tradable services to tradable
industries, with an increase in exports and

Ireland is a notable exception with a strong fall in the
manufacturing deflators in the post crisis period: this
is explained by its US-dollar denominated exports.

and operating margins to value-added deflators in
Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Greece and Slovenia in
2002-12. (5) The graphs distinguish manufacturing
and market services (as example of tradables and
non-tradables). Data for manufacturing indicate
that the reduction in labour costs since 2010 has, as
expected, been partially absorbed by an increase in
operating margins. For services, there was a
cyclical reduction or moderation in margins in
2009-11, but margins rebounded and more than
absorbed the reduction in labour costs in the course
of 2012. Although high financing costs in
vulnerable countries may have contributed to the
explanation of the persistently high margins, the
high operating margins over the last quarters of
available data clearly suggest a lack of domestic
competition.

Competition, structural reforms and rebalancing

Structural reforms, which aim to increase
competition, facilitate the entry and exit of firms in
specific sectors and increase productivity, have a
role in the rebalancing process. Among tradables,
improvements in the business environment (e.g.
reduction in red tape) contribute to increase firms'
margins, improve investment opportunities and
help firms reallocating resources to export-oriented
sectors. But the increase in competition in the nontradables and the related reduction in margins and
prices also matters for rebalancing. Many nontradables (services, utilities, etc.) are inputs for
tradables. Also, a reduction in rents in nontradables contributes to moving resources to
tradables. Moreover, the reduction in prices of nontradables helps dampening the fall in households'
real disposable income, alleviating the downward
pressure on domestic demand.

(a) As a percentage of population of working age (15-74). Definition according to the Labour Force Survey.

Employment losses in 2012 were concentrated in
industry, construction and public administration,
resulting from employment cuts in the public
sector and reallocation of labour across sectors in
some Member States. Given the still-low level of
hours worked after the large drop during the
2008-09 recession, headcount employment has
recently been affected much more strongly by the
economic downturn.
The labour supply in terms of total labour force
grew strongly in 2012, by around 0.7% in the EU
and 0.6% in the euro area, after 0.2% and 0.3%
respectively in 2011. Rising activity rates partly
reflect pre-crisis trends of increasing participation
rates of female and older workers. But policies
recently undertaken at the Member-State level,
notably pension reforms, intensified this trend
together with cyclical factors. In particular, second
earners of given households seem to have been
entering the labour market to counteract
households' reduced income expectations.

remained far above their long-term average.
However, temporary employment has started
growing again since the second quarter of 2012,
indicating companies' cautious hiring policy which
reflects the widespread uncertainty on the strength
of the prospective recovery. Overall, employment
is projected to decrease by ½% in the EU and by
¾% in the euro area in 2013, while the
unemployment rate is set to climb higher in the
euro area and the EU and to remain at elevated
levels over the forecast horizon (see Table I.4).

… as employment is set to shrink in the short
term …

Looking to the near future, the EU labour market is
expected to weaken further, reflecting the usually
delayed response to changes in economic activity.
The latest readings of Commission surveys suggest
a deterioration of the labour market conditions
with additional job losses and rising
unemployment in the short term (see Graph I.17).
In March 2013, employment expectations in the
EU remained below their long-term averages in
construction and, albeit to a lesser extent, in
industry and services. Companies' intentions to
reduce staff were also mirrored by strong
unemployment fears among consumers, which

… with unemployment becoming more firmly
entrenched.

The magnitude and longer duration of
unemployment has raised concerns that the
cyclical increases in joblessness might eventually
turn into structural unemployment. The share of
the long-term unemployed, i.e. persons being out
of work for more than 12 months, has been
constantly rising in the EU since mid-2009 and
climbed to 46% in the fourth quarter of 2012. In
addition, unemployment among the young (15 to
24 years) who are not in education or training is

29

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2013

high. In particular, the lack of on-the-job training
and experience is likely to jeopardise the future
employability of young workers which in turn
might dampen a future labour market recovery,
most notably in vulnerable Member States.
According to Commission estimates, the nonaccelerating wage rate of unemployment
(NAWRU), a gauge of structural unemployment,
has indeed increased substantially since 2008 and
indicators of labour-market mismatch have
worsened. But some caution is warranted as to the
long-term trend of structural unemployment given
that NAWRU estimates are influenced by a broad
range of factors, for example labour market
adjustment frictions and large negative shocks.
A silver lining on the forecast horizon in 2014 …

The modest recovery in economic activity
predicted for 2014 is likely to help stabilising the
labour market situation. Reduced uncertainty and a
firming recovery are expected to give rise to
modest employment growth in 2014 of around ½%
in the EU and ¼% in the euro area. Given the
projected growth in the labour force, the
unemployment rate is likely to stabilise at elevated
levels in 2014, at slightly above 12% in the euro
area and at around 11% in the EU. Visible
improvements in the EU and euro-area labour
market are expected only towards the end of the
forecast horizon, as the necessary reallocation of
resources from the non-tradable to the tradable
sector in vulnerable Member States is likely to take
time and to be hampered by weak economic
prospects as well as financing constraints on
investment.
… but still clouded by large cross-country
divergences.

The labour market performance differs widely
across Member States and large growth
differentials will entail a further widening of those
divergences in 2013. Unemployment rates are
expected to range between less than 5% in Austria
and 27% in Spain and Greece.
The varying labour market situation across
countries is also reflected in diverging wage
developments. Since 2011, real wages increases
have lagged behind productivity growth in most
high-unemployment countries facing substantial
internal and external adjustment needs. Looking
ahead, wage moderation is set to continue in
vulnerable Member States, supported by recently

30

adopted reforms in the wage-setting system,
allowing for a further gradual improvement in
price competitiveness. By contrast, a marked rise
in unit labour costs was observed in countries with
relatively low unemployment in the post-crisis
years up 2012 and real wages per head are set to
grow faster than in the pre-crisis years of 2003-07,
notably in Germany.
Inflation continues to decline at solid pace…

The decrease in consumer-price inflation that has
started in the last quarter of 2012 continued in the
beginning of 2013. However, the lower-thanexpected contribution of energy prices has led to
headline inflation falling below the 2% threshold
already in the first quarter of 2013 in the euro area,
marking an end to the period of nine quarters with
inflation above the ECB's definition of price
stability. Likewise, inflation in the EU eased in the
first quarter of 2013, falling below 2% in March.
…while core inflation remains sticky despite
weak domestic demand.

Irrespective of the fading impact of increases in
indirect taxes and administrative prices in several
Member States as well as the waning pass-through
effects from past energy-price hikes and exchangerate depreciations, core inflation (i.e. HICP
inflation excluding energy and unprocessed food)
has hardly moderated since September 2012 in
both the euro area and the EU. Underlying
inflation increased again in the euro area to 1.6%
in March 2013 and to 1.7% in the EU. Despite the
amount of slack in the economy, core inflation is
projected to remain broadly stable over the
forecast horizon at around 1½% in the euro area
and 1¾% in the EU (see Graph I.18), reflecting the
historical pattern.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Limited external price pressures, …

Owing to the appreciation of the euro that
effectively offset increases in commodity prices,
external price pressures eased in recent months.
Given the still anaemic domestic demand in
several Member States and exchange-rate and
commodity-price assumptions, import prices are
projected to ease sharply in 2013 as measured by
the deflator of imports of goods. In 2014, with the
expected gradual recovery in private investment
and household consumption import-price inflation
is forecast to accelerate marginally.

… a moderate wage push …

Wage pressures have been subdued throughout
2012. In the euro area, the hourly labour cost index
fell from 2.2% in 2011 to 1.6% in 2012, while the
growth in compensation per employee decreased
from 2.2% to 1.8% respectively (though large
cross-country divergences persist). However, as
the growth of labour productivity was flat in 2012,
the unit-labour-cost growth accelerated to 1.4%, up
from 0.9% a year before. Despite the subdued
economic outlook and unemployment reaching
historically-high levels in the EU, wage pressures
are not expected to fade significantly over the
forecast horizon. This is in line with the rise in
adjustment frictions and labour market mismatch
as suggested by the increase in NAWRU estimates.
… and dwindling producer-price inflation …

Inflation pressures from the producer side seem to
be contained at the beginning of 2013. In February,
annual industrial producer price inflation
(excluding construction) fell to around 1¼% in the
EU and the euro area from close to 3% in 2012,
driven mostly by substantially lower energy price
inflation. The survey indicators of price
developments (both PMI and ESI components) are
also reflecting the weakness in economic
conditions, contributing to the expected further
easing in pipeline pressures (see Graph I.19).
… point to a benign inflation outlook.

The average annual HICP inflation in 2013 is
expected to average 1.8% in the EU and 1.6% in
the euro area. Price pressures are set to ease
markedly, as past increases in oil prices and
indirect taxes in many Member States to consumer
prices are continuously falling out of the annual
comparison. Moreover, the weak economic
environment and ailing domestic demand is

Looking further ahead, the muted recovery
projected to begin in the second half of 2013 is
unlikely to raise significant inflationary pressures,
given the amount of slack in the economy and
well-anchored inflation expectations. Under the
no-policy-change assumption (i.e. excluding fiscal
measures that are not known or sufficiently
specified at the cut-off date that might have an
impact on headline inflation via e.g. tax rises),
HICP inflation in 2014 in the EU and the euro area
is set to decrease further to 1.7% and 1.5%
respectively, giving some respite to consumers'
real disposable incomes and thus contributing to
prospects for a pick-up in private consumption
expenditure.
A slower pace of fiscal consolidation amid a
weak growth environment …

Despite the subdued macroeconomic outlook and
the limited support from the cyclical component,
the reduction in general government deficits is set
to continue over the forecast horizon. Compared to
the winter 2013 forecast, the overall picture of
public finance conditions is expected to remain
largely unchanged in both the euro area and the
EU. (16)
The fiscal policy stance was broadly
contractionary in 2012 due to extensive fiscal
consolidation measures in several Member States
(see also Box I.4). Thus, the deficit-to-GDP ratio
for the euro area and the EU as a whole shrank by

around ½ pp. to 3.7% of GDP and to 4.0% of GDP
respectively. In 2013, further deficit reductions are
expected to be dampened by the still negative
cyclical contribution. On the basis of the fiscal
consolidation efforts detailed in national budgets,
the headline deficit in 2013 is set to further
decrease to 2.9% of GDP in the euro area and to
3.4% of GDP in the EU (see Graph I.20).

well as public investment, are expected to be the
main drivers of the reduction in the headline
deficit.
Structural balances expected to improve in
2013 …

The structural budget deficit, i.e. the general
government deficit corrected for cyclical factors
and one-offs and other temporary measures,
declined significantly in 2012, by 1½% of GDP in
the euro area and slightly over 1% of GDP in the
EU. This development is projected to continue this
year in both areas, albeit at a slower pace. Against
the backdrop of fiscal consolidation measures
included in the 2013 national budgets, the
structural deficit is expected to shrink to 1½% of
GDP in the euro area and to 2% in the EU,
reflecting an improvement of around ¾ pp. in both
areas. Under the usual no-policy-change
assumption the structural deficit in both areas is
forecast to deteriorate slightly in 2014.

Changes in structural balance (rhs)

Based on the usual no-policy-change assumption,
the general government deficit is projected to
decline slightly further in 2014 to 2.8% of GDP in
the euro area and to 3.2% of GDP in the EU. With
a few exceptions, the expected improvement over
the forecast horizon is likely to be broad-based
across Member States.
… with a gradual shift from revenue increases
to spending cuts.

In both the EU and the euro area, the deficit
reductions in 2012 were exclusively due to
revenue-based consolidation. General government
revenues increased as several Member States
raised taxes on income and wealth and, to a lesser
extent, indirect taxes. As a result, the revenue-toGDP ratio increased in both areas in 2012 and is
set to reach a peak over the forecast horizon in
2013 at 46.8% and 45.8% in the euro area and the
EU respectively. Further ahead, revenues are
expected to decrease slightly in 2014, as temporary
tax increases are set to expire and limited tax cuts
are planned in some Member States. With regard
to government spending, the expenditure-to-GDP
ratio is projected to start declining in 2013 and to
decrease further towards the end of the forecast
horizon, as the expected moderate pick-up in
economic activity is likely to have a positive effect
via automatic stabilisers. However, discretionary
cuts in expenditure, mainly wages and salaries as

…but adverse debt dynamics are driving debt
ratios higher.

Given the adverse debt dynamics implied by an
increase in interest expenditure against a slowing
GDP growth, the projected reduction in general
government deficits is unlikely to prevent debt-toGDP ratios from increasing over the forecast
horizon (see Table I.5). Compared to the winter
2013 forecast, however, public debt ratios have
been revised slightly downwards for 2012 in the
euro area and for 2012 and 2013 in the EU. (17)

The "snow-ball effect" captures the impact of interest expenditure on accumulated
debt, as well as the impact of real GDP growth and inflation on the debt ratio
(through the denominator). The stock-flow adjustment includes differences in cash
and accrual accounting, accumulation of financial assets and valuation and other
residual effects.

At the country level, debt-to-GDP ratios for Greece and
Spain were revised downwards for 2012 which also shifted
the debt ratio for the EU and the euro-area aggregate
somewhat lower.

Box I.4: Combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to assessing the fiscal stance:
the discretionary fiscal effort
Discussions over fiscal policy are framed by the
way fiscal stance is assessed. The traditional
indicator for evaluating the fiscal stance – the
change in the structural (primary) balance – is
calculated following a "top-down approach", which
consists in removing from headline balances oneoff and temporary measures, as well as the effect of
the business cycle, based on standard
methodologies. When computing structural primary
balances, interest payments are also removed.
This "top-down" indicator, which is routinely
calculated by the Commission and easily available,
is well-established in EU surveillance and policy
discussions. (1) The key advantage of this indicator
is to convey the information on where the
government balance would be should the economy
be at its potential. Accordingly, the structural
balance and its evolution provide crucial
information for assessing the sustainability of the
budgetary position and the current fiscal stance.
However, this indicator is subject to well-known
limitations. In particular, structural balances rely on
uncertain evaluations of the cyclical position.
Equally important, its computation conventionally
assumes a stable effect of output gaps on the fiscal
accounts, relying on average fixed values of tax
and spending semi-elasticities. In practice these
semi-elasticities tend to fluctuate markedly in the
short term. Structural (primary) balances may for
these reasons deliver an inaccurate view of the true
underlying direction of fiscal policy.
A complementary, "bottom-up" approach to
assessing the fiscal stance is being used as an
important check within EU surveillance
procedures. It consists in adding-up the effects of
all implemented tax and spending new measures.
This approach has the advantage of being less
exposed to errors in measuring potential output and
fluctuations in fiscal elasticities. In addition,
because of its action-based nature, a bottom-up
indicator can be more telling for policy-makers and

outsiders, as it reflects the sum of active policy
decisions. (2)
At the same time, the bottom-up approach is also
subject to limitations. First, it relies on estimates of
the budgetary costs or savings from tax and
spending measures which come with their own
measurement uncertainties, particularly when the
underlying data for evaluating measures is lacking
or of poor quality. Second, the "baseline" on the
expenditure side is a somewhat elusive concept. In
particular, while on the revenue side an absence of
measures can reasonably be equated with a neutral
stance, this is generally not the case on the
spending side. (3) Consequently, one has to be
careful when drawing conclusions from a bottomup approach on the spending side, since the
underlying baselines may present significant
methodological differences across countries.
Given this background, an intermediary approach
that relies on a mixed method is useful for
assessing the fiscal stance and conducting crosscountry assessments. This is what lies behind the
indicator presented in this box.
The proposed measure of the fiscal stance is in fact
already present in EU surveillance. Specifically, the
discretionary fiscal effort is gauged as the deviation
from the expenditure benchmark, which serves as a
reference, together with the change in the structural
balance, for assessing progress towards the
medium-term objective (MTO) in the preventive
(2)

An up-to-date presentation of the EU framework for
calculating structural balances can be found in
Mourre, G., Isbasoiu, G.-M., Paternoster, D. and M.
Salto, The cyclically-adjusted budget balance used in
the EU fiscal framework: an update, European
Economy Economic Papers (DG ECFIN), No. 478,
March 2013.

The spirit of bottom-up approaches is presented in
Skaarup, M., A bottom-up approach to assess the
budgetary impact of discretionary fiscal policies,
Finansministeriet Working Paper (Danish Ministry
of Finance), No. 15, 2005. Bottom-up approaches
bear link with the recent literature on action-based
measures of the fiscal stance, as kick-started in
Romer, C. and D. Romer, The macroeconomic
effects of tax changes: estimates based on a new
measure of fiscal shocks, NBER Working Paper,
No. 13264, July 2007 (American Economic Review,
June 2010, Vol. 100, No. 3, pp. 763-801).
Specifically, an absence of measure on the spending
side need not imply a broadly constant expenditure
ratio, even in the long-run. For example, expenditure
on entitlements may follow higher trends than GDP
because of the effects of ageing. In addition, for some
expenditure categories, such as investment and the
wage bill, what "no measure" means is not
conceptually straightforward.

(Continued on the next page)

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2013

Box (continued)

This measure is a mixed method in the following
sense:




On the revenue side, it relies on a truly bottomup approach, as the effort is simply computed
by adding-up the effects of new tax measures in
the year of interest.
On the expenditure side, however, an
essentially top-down method is kept by
measuring the effort as the gap between
spending and potential growth. This is because
of the methodological limitations noted above,
but also for a more positive reason. Defined
this way, this measure of the fiscal stance
indicates whether policy is inducing growth
above or below potential GDP. In particular, a
neutral stance corresponds to a situation where
the authorities do not aim at changing the
medium-run values of the tax and expenditure
to GDP ratios; that is, there is no attempt to
stimulate demand above or below potential
growth.

Note that, in line with the expenditure-benchmark
definition, the proposed indicator relies on a more
stable (medium-term) notion of potential growth as
a reference for expenditure growth, among other
adjustments made on the spending side compared
with the structural balance approach. (5) These
adjustments are meant to get closer to a timeinvariant notion of the underlying fiscal effort.
Specifically, for a given amount of expenditure
measures, the evaluated fiscal stance will not too
significantly be affected by temporary fluctuations
in activity and potential growth.

(4)

(5)

34

A presentation of the expenditure benchmark can be
found in The 2011 reform of the Stability and Growth
Pact, Report on public finances in EMU 2012,
European Economy, 4.
The medium-term potential growth rate is calculated
as the 10-year average (involving the last 5 years and
the forecast and projections for the current and 4 next
years) of the "annual potential growth" traditionally
used in surveillance and underpinning the calculation
of the cyclically-adjusted balance. The other
adjustments are the following: interest payments,
government expenditure programmes matched by EU
funds
and
non-discretionary
unemployment
expenditure are removed from the expenditure
aggregate; public investment is also removed and
replaced by its four-year average in order to smooth
the volatility observed in this variable.

As an indicator of the orientation of fiscal policy,
the deviation from the expenditure benchmark
brings a useful complementary perspective to the
change in the structural balance. This may be
especially the case in periods such as the current
juncture, where several economies of the EU are
undergoing large shocks and adjustments, such as
rebalancing towards tradable sectors that translate
into temporary tax-poor growth and downward
changes in potential growth. Graph 1 presents the
fiscal stance in 2012-13 according to both metrics.

calculating structural balances.

Change in the structural balance
Deviation form the expenditure benchmark

In general, the two indicators can be expected to
deliver consistent messages regarding the direction
of the fiscal stance (there are three countries where
both indicators differ in sign, but in these cases the
indicators are of rather small magnitude). However,
there are significant quantitative differences. The
countries showing the highest values of the
discretionary fiscal-effort measure compared to the
change in the structural balance are Ireland,
Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal, Slovenia and, to a
lesser extent, the Czech Republic and Italy. The
discretionary fiscal effort is also higher than the
change in the structural balance for the average of
the EU or the euro area close to ¾% of GDP. By
contrast, but in a less significant manner, the
discretionary fiscal effort is currently suggestive of
a looser policy than the change in the structural
balance in Germany, Luxembourg, Malta and
Sweden.
These results suggest that for a number of
countries, but especially for those experiencing a
marked fiscal tightening, the underlying degree of
policy retrenchment needed to deliver a given
improvement in the structural balance is currently
higher than in normal circumstances. This also
holds for the average of the EU or the euro area.
Contributing factors include unusually revenuepoor activity and marked temporary slowdown in
potential output in relation with the on-going
rebalancing of these economies.

The structural budget balance is the cyclically-adjusted budget balance net of one-off and other temporary measures
estimated by the European Commission.

Overall, the debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area
exceeded 90% of GDP already in 2012 and is
expected to increase further over the forecast
horizon, albeit at a slowing rate, to around 96% in
2014. In the EU, gross public debt is projected to
increase by less than 4 pps. over the forecast
horizon and to exceed the threshold of 90% in
2014, when the increase of the debt ratio is also
expected to have slowed down considerably (see
Table I.6).

waning support for fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms or delayed implementation of
crisis-management institutions constitutes a major
downside risk.

Since mid-2012, perceived tail risks have
substantially diminished and downside risks to the
growth outlook have accordingly decreased. This
is mainly due to decisive policy actions that
effectively counteracted financial market stress
and gradually lifted confidence of market
participants. But even though the balance of risks
appears to be less tilted to the downside at the
current juncture since redenomination risks have
subsided, uncertainty remains elevated and
downside risks still loom large, as illustrated by
the fan chart. (see Graph I.21). (18)
A renewed intensification of the sovereign-debt
crisis in the euro area remains the predominant risk
to the prospective recovery. The European banking
sector is still crisis-prone and complacency about
policy reforms could jeopardise the still fragile
macro-financial stability and erode confidence. In
particular, heightened policy uncertainty due to

Deteriorating fiscal positions in some Member
States might require consolidation measures
beyond those already embedded in the central
scenario which is also to some part affected by the
no-policy-change assumption. The baseline
forecast also entails a stronger employment
response to GDP contractions than in the previous
recession, but there is still an additional risk that
the extent of labour shedding in some Member
States could turn into an accelerated downward
spiral, with negative confidence and real income
effects triggering further job losses.
Additional downside risks are linked to the
external environment. The most detrimental effects
of the fiscal cliff in the US have been avoided, but
uncertainty continues to surround the negotiations
on the debt ceiling and the impact of the automatic

35

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2013

and hardly targeted spending cuts in the
sequestration on domestic demand might be
stronger than expected. Furthermore, the path to a
sustainable medium-term fiscal situation is still
uncertain in the US, and even more so in Japan,
where the problematic state of public finances has
the potential to alarm financial markets. A further
appreciation of the euro, not captured by the
technical assumption of unchanged exchange rates
over the forecast horizon, could weigh on EU
external trade. Finally, an escalation of geopolitical
tensions could result in oil-supply disruptions and
surging commodity prices.
On the upside, the overall benign development in
financial markets might support confidence more
strongly than envisaged in the baseline and the
reform of the institutional framework for the euro
area might be implemented faster than expected,
thus further reducing policy uncertainty and
benefiting sentiment. Structural reforms in
vulnerable Member States could result in early
positive effects and accelerate the adjustment

process in several Member States. On the external
side, the global recovery could turn out somewhat
more robust than expected in the central scenario,
with stronger domestic demand in the US on the
back of an improving housing market and in Japan
helped by a larger-than-expected impact of the
recently announced new round of fiscal measures
and monetary easing. Likewise, the recovery in
emerging market economies could prove
somewhat more dynamic than previously expected
due to a stronger impact of recent expansionary
policy measures.
Risks to the inflation outlook are seen to be
broadly balanced over the forecast horizon. Upside
risks are stemming from stronger-than-expected
increases in indirect taxes and administrative
prices as well as higher oil prices. On the
downside, weaker-than-expected economic activity
in the EU and the global economy, possibly
coupled with declining nominal rigidities induced
by product and labour market reforms might
reduce price pressures even further.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Box I.5: Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
23 April. The forecast incorporates validated public
finance data as published in Eurostat's News
Release 64/2013 of 22 April 2013.
External assumptions

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 8 and 19 April) were used for exchange
and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption as regards exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.31
both in 2013 and in 2014. The average JPY/EUR
rates are 127.19 in 2013 and 129.04 in 2014.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based.
Short-term interest rates for the euro area are
derived from futures contracts. Long-term interest
rates for the euro area, as well as short- and
long-term interest rates for other Member States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro-area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are assumed to be 0.2% on average in
2013 and 0.3% in 2014 in the euro area. Long-term
euro-area interest rates are assumed to be 1.4% on
average in 2013 and 1.6% in 2014.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as
possible, based on market conditions. According to
futures markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to
be on average 104.9 USD/bbl in 2013 and 99.2
USD/bbl in 2014. This would correspond to an oil
price of 80 EUR/bbl in 2013 and 75.8 EUR/bbl in
2014.

For the forecast, measures in support of financial
stability have been recorded in line with the
Eurostat Decision of 15 July 2009.(1) Unless
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned,
capital injections known in sufficient detail have
been included in the forecast as financial
transactions, i.e. increasing the debt, but not the
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and
deposits are not included as government
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have
been called on at the time the forecast was
finalised. Note, however, that loans granted to
banks by the government, or by other entities
classified in the government sector, usually add to
government debt.
For 2013, budgets adopted or presented to national
parliaments and all other measures known in
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For
2014, the 'no-policy-change' assumption used in the
forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures
that are known in sufficient detail.
The general government balances that are relevant
for the Excessive Deficit Procedure may be slightly
different from those published in the national
accounts. The difference concerns settlements
under swaps and forward rate agreements (FRA).
According to ESA95 (amended by regulation No.
2558/2001), swap- and FRA-related flows are
financial transactions and therefore excluded from
the calculation of the government balance.
However, for the purposes of the excessive deficit
procedure, such flows are recorded as net interest
expenditure. European aggregates for general
government debt in the forecast years 2013-14 are
published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not
corrected for intergovernmental loans). To ensure
consistency in the time series, historical data are
also published on the same basis. For 2012, this
implies a debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area which
is 2.0 pp. (1.5 pp. in the EU) higher than the
consolidated general government debt ratio
published by Eurostat in its news release 64/2013
of 22 April 2013.

forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited over the
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and
unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally (by
up to ±0.1 pp.). The calculation of potential growth
and the output gap does not adjust for working
days. Since the working-day effect is considered as
temporary, it should not affect the cyclicallyadjusted balances.

Prospects by individual economy

1. BELGIUM
Headline fiscal deficit remains high
External trade expected to prevent economy
from contracting

The Belgian economy ended 2012 on a negative
note, shrinking by 0.1% in the final quarter on the
back of weaker than anticipated investments. Over
the full year, GDP receded by 0.2% as domestic
demand fell to the lowest level since 2009. While
GDP in the first quarter of this year is expected to
have stagnated, the broad-based reversal since
March of modest previous gains in economic
sentiment indicators implies that the recovery is
likely to strengthen very gradually, towards the
year-end. As a consequence, annual GDP growth
is likely to remain flat this year and reach 1.2%
next year.

GDP growth (y-o-y%)

In the final quarter of 2012 private consumption
recorded the highest growth in two years.
However, this did not prevent it from shrinking
over the year as a whole, a noteworthy contrast
with the recession of 2009 when private spending
held up well. Private consumption is set to stagnate
also this year amid deteriorating employment
prospects and recent losses in real disposable
income. Household spending is forecast to gain
speed only as of next year, when it is set to become
the main driver of GDP expansion.
Overall domestic demand is set to continue to
contract this year with investment suffering from
an economy-wide lack of confidence, a depressed
construction sector, tightening credit conditions
and an industry featuring ample spare capacity,
reflected in negative equipment investment
growth. The ongoing uncertainty about employee

42

statute reforms – which may imply a change in
dismissal parameters – adds an extra dose of risk
aversion in the short term. Nevertheless, towards
the end of 2013 also investment should start to
reflect the gradual economic turnaround.
Net exports are expected to prevent overall GDP
from contracting two years in a row. Given its
openness, the Belgian economy is likely to benefit
from the global upturn. Nevertheless, Belgian
exports will still be outpaced by global exports,
implying that the current loss in export market
shares is set to continue. While export growth
would accelerate next year, import growth can be
expected to catch up on the back of a more robust
domestic demand, thereby limiting further gains
from net exports.
Given its small size and openness, economic
developments across the euro area remain a major
determinant
for
the
Belgian
economy.
Nevertheless, risks to the economic outlook appear
tilted to the upside as more solid than projected
global growth or a faster revival of confidence – at
home or in neighbouring trading partner countries
– may inject more dynamism in the domestic
economy.
Slowing inflation
developments

reflects

energy

price

In line with developments across the euro area,
price pressures in Belgium have been decelerating
in recent months. As a consequence, inflation is
forecast to decline to levels considerably lower
than those seen in recent years and stay much
closer to the euro-area averages. The main driver is
the negative contribution of energy prices,
reflecting both international price developments
and enhanced competition on the domestic retail
market. However, also an economy operating
considerably below potential limits price pressures.
Unemployment averaged 7.6% in 2012. The
unemployment rate is predicted to hit 8.0% this
year with job creation being insufficient to match
the labour force growth. Unit labour costs are
expected to rise by 2.4% in 2013, reflecting the
pass-through of past inflation rates into wages due
to the wage indexation scheme. Moderating
inflationary pressures as well as the real wage

Member States, Belgium

freeze and higher productivity would cap the rise
in unit labour costs at 0.5% in 2014.

At unchanged policy, the deficit is expected to rise
again to 3.1% of GDP in 2014, despite the
projected acceleration in growth. This is due to the
autonomous rising trend in social transfers and the
fact that the 2013 budget also included around
0.4% of GDP of one-off and temporary revenues,
such as a fiscal amnesty, the sale of telecom
licences and an exceptionally high dividend from
the Belgian National Bank.

Fiscal deficit is projected to wobble around 3%
of GDP

The general government deficit reached 3.9% of
GDP in 2012, including a negative impact of
0.8 pp. due to the recapitalisation of Dexia bank by
the Belgian State. Current government expenditure
– which does not include this one-off operation –
rose by 3.9% in 2012 and reached the historically
high level of 51.2% of GDP. Social transfers
(4.8%) and interest expenditure (4.2%) recorded
the highest growth. New measures included in the
2012 budget drove revenues up from 49.5% of
GDP in 2011 to 50.8% in 2012.

The structural budget balance is estimated to have
improved by ½ pp. of GDP in 2012, despite
sizeable government measures. In 2013 a further
improvement in structural terms of ¾ pp. is
expected, with lower interest expenditure
contributing around ¼ pp. to the improvement.
The general government debt is estimated to have
increased from 97.8% in 2011 to 99.6% of GDP in
2012. The impact of the recapitalisation of Dexia
on the debt (0.8% of GDP) has been offset by the
reimbursement of a loan by KBC. Under the
current forecast, the debt ratio continues to rise
over the forecast horizon, to around 102% of GDP
in 2014.

In 2013, the deficit is projected to decrease to
2.9% of GDP, 0.1 pp. lower than expected in the
winter forecast, following new government
measures announced at the end of March and a
further decline in interest rates. However, these
factors are partly offset by the downward revision
in growth.

2. BULGARIA
Modest economic recovery but weak labour market
Domestic demand supported growth in 2012

GDP growth decelerated from 1.8% in 2011 to
0.8% in 2012, due to the euro-area financial
turbulence and weaker export markets. While the
contribution from net exports became negative in
2012, domestic demand supported growth. A
recovery in private consumption was the main
driver of growth, along with a substantial positive
contribution from inventories. After three years of
strong contraction, investment activity has also
stabilised over 2012.

horizon as imports are also boosted by the
recovery in household consumption and
investment.
The current-account deficit is
therefore forecast to widen further to some 3½% of
GDP by 2014.

In the first months of 2013, the fragile external
environment and the weak labour market are
expected to have been a drag on the economic
activity in Bulgaria. The social protests leading to
the change of government in February-March (and
early elections in May 2013) are set to have only a
limited impact on economic growth, as indicated
by unwavering business and consumer sentiment
recorded during these months. GDP growth is
projected to pick up towards the end of the year in
line with the expected recovery in the EU. For the
year as a whole, GDP growth is forecast to reach
0.9% in 2013 and to accelerate to 1.7% in 2014.
Domestic demand is expected to continue to drive
the economic recovery, supported by the relatively
strong financial sector and the small fiscal stimulus
in 2013. Monthly data (latest from February 2013)
from the banking sector indicates a continuation of
the downward trend in both deposit and lending
interest rates along with a modest growth in
corporate credit, supporting domestic demand.
Household consumption is forecast to expand in
2013 and to pick up further in 2014, assuming a
gradual recovery in household confidence and of
the labour market. In 2013, total investment is
projected to be mainly driven by EU co-financed
public sector projects. Private sector investment is
set to also pick up gradually, in line with the
economic recovery and easing financing
conditions.
The first months of 2013 indicate strong growth in
exports to non-EU countries, especially on account
of energy and base metal products. Nevertheless,
the contribution to growth from net exports is
expected to remain negative over the forecast

Risks related to this baseline scenario seem
broadly balanced. The most significant downside
risk is related to the current positive momentum in
household consumption, which could reverse given
that the Bulgarian labour market and household
sentiment are still fragile. As an upside risk,
exports could develop more favourably if the past
trend of gains in global market shares resumes
after a dip in 2012.
Continued weakness of the labour market

While GDP has recovered somewhat over the past
years, the labour market has remained remarkably
weak. In 2012, employment fell by 4½%,
continuing its rapid decline. In terms of sectors,
this is due to the continuing restructuring and
downsizing of industry and a marked decline in
self-employed agricultural workers. Given the
relatively weak economic recovery in 2013,
employment is projected to fall by a further 2% in
the current year, but stabilise in 2014.
Unemployment has increased less than the sharp
decline in employment would suggest. This is
explained by a contraction in the working-age
population due to unfavourable demographic
trends and emigration. In 2012, the unemployment
rate increased to 12.3%, 1 pp. higher than in the

Member States, Bulgaria

previous year. Unemployment is expected to peak
at 12.5% in 2013 and to edge down only slightly in
2014. In spite of the weak labour market, average
wages have continued to increase, though more
moderately than in the previous year. Wages are
pushed up by several factors, notably by wage
convergence towards the EU average and by
labour market mismatches.

GDP in 2012. The improvement was driven by
lower-than-planned expenditure, largely on
account of investments. However, the unrealised
investment expenditure will likely be carried over
to the following years. Also, VAT revenues were
exceptionally strong in 2012, boosted by strong
domestic demand, imports and measures to
improve tax compliance.

Inflation to decelerate in 2013

The headline deficit is set to weaken to 1.3% of
GDP in 2013 on account of expenditure increases
and stay unchanged in 2014. Notably, pensions
have been increased by 9.3% on 1 April 2013. The
2013 state budget also provides for increases to
some other social expenditure, wages of some
specific professions and investments. Overall, the
budget implies a slightly expansionary fiscal
stance in 2013 and a neutral one in 2014. The
structural deficit is estimated to weaken somewhat
from ½% of GDP in 2012 to below 1% of GDP in
2013-14. Given the scheduled repayment of a large
government bond, general government gross debt
is forecast to decline slightly in 2013 from the
previous year, but to rise to 20.3% of GDP in
2014.

HICP inflation peaked in the third quarter of 2012
at 3% y-o-y, reflecting hikes in global energy and
food prices. The first months of 2013 show a
stabilisation of global energy and food prices as
well as a reduction in some administered domestic
energy prices. HICP inflation is therefore expected
to moderate to 2% in 2013, but then to accelerate
to 2.6% in 2014. Core inflation is projected to
gradually pick up given the expected recovery in
domestic demand and the ongoing convergence of
prices towards EU averages.
Some expenditure increases in 2013

The general government deficit has improved

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
Running in neutral gear
Economic activity to bottom out in 2013

Real GDP growth continued to fall in the fourth
quarter of 2012, although at a slower pace
compared to the beginning of the year. Due to a
strong downturn in consumer confidence, a drop in
public investment and a weaker external
environment, real GDP is estimated to have
decreased by 1.3% in 2012. As these factors ease
off in 2013, economic activity is forecast to bottom
out in the middle of the year. The recovery is
expected to consolidate in 2014, supported by
growth of real household income. Domestic risks
to the outlook are fairly balanced.

Falling real income of households...

Private consumption posted higher-than-expected
growth of 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012. This
improvement was, however, partly a result of a
one-off increase in wages and advanced purchases
in anticipation of the January 2013 hikes in labour
taxes, health contributions and VAT (which also
led to an increase in inventories). As only a limited
part of the increase reflects an underlying
improvement in household confidence, a partial
reversal is expected in the first quarter of 2013.
Thereafter, gains in private consumption
expenditure are expected to remain subdued as real
disposable income is projected to fall in 2013 and
the high household saving rate is forecast to
diminish only gradually. Private consumption
growth is expected to pick up in 2014 on the back
of a more positive labour market outlook.

46

... and a subdued outlook for the industrial
sector are the main near-term drags on growth

While industrial production is showing signs of
stabilisation compared to the end of 2012, falling
domestic and foreign orders are keeping the
negative sentiment in manufacturing firmly
entrenched. At the turn of 2013, output was lower
year-on-year notably in manufacturing of
computer and electronic products and also in
motor vehicles. However, the bank lending survey
of the central bank suggests that financing
conditions remain relatively favourable in early
2013. Access to credit is therefore not expected to
weigh on growth. Overall, gross fixed capital
formation is expected to start growing only in the
second half of the year and to post a decrease of
3.2% in 2013 as a whole, reflecting a strong
negative carry-over effect from 2012. In line with
the projected improvement in consumption and
exports, more robust growth in investment is
forecast for 2014.
Net exports are expected to contribute positively to
GDP growth over the forecast horizon although
less strongly than in previous years, which is
consistent with the slow recovery of the key
European markets and somewhat stronger
domestic demand. The current-account balance is
expected to stabilise around -2.5%.
The labour market has so far shown substantial
flexibility in accommodating lower labour
demand. As employers were able to adjust hours
worked, the unemployment rate rose only
marginally from 7.0% in 2012 to 7.2% in February
2013. It is expected to average 7.5% in 2013 and to
edge lower in 2014. Wage growth is expected to
remain subdued in 2013.
Low inflation ahead

Inflation is expected to average just below 2% in
2013 and to decrease further in 2014. Changes in
indirect taxes are estimated to add around 0.9 pp.
to inflation in 2013 and only around 0.1 pp. in
2014. Cost pressures from import prices and
domestic demand are expected to remain low, even
though unit labour costs are still set to rise over the
forecast horizon due to low productivity growth.

record low level, public investment is projected to
increase alongside a slow pick up in government
consumption. The structural deficit is projected to
rise by 0.1 pp. to 1.6% of GDP in 2013.

Persistent general government deficit

The budgetary outcome in 2012 was significantly
more favourable than expected. The general
government deficit reached 4.4% of GDP,
compared to 5.2% in the 2013 winter forecast due
to a continued substantial reduction in public
investment and higher revenues, mainly due to a
VAT hike. This outcome incorporates the impact
of two one-off deficit-increasing operations: the
adoption of the law on financial compensations to
churches (1.5 pps. of GDP) and financial
corrections resulting from irregularities in the
management of EU funds (0.3 pp. of GDP), which
mask a stronger nominal improvement.

In 2014, the general government deficit is forecast
to increase slightly to 3.0% of GDP. Government
consumption is projected to increase moderately
despite further cuts in intermediate consumption
(0.1 pp. of GDP). Public investment is set to
continue to grow, while tax receipts should benefit
from a recovering economy and from further hikes
in excise duties (0.1 pp. of GDP). Interest
expenditure is projected to continue to growth due
to the rising debt-to-GDP ratio, which is forecast
to be 50.0% in 2014. A temporary tax on
photovoltaic power plants (0.2 pp. of GDP) is set
to expire in 2014.The structural deficit is expected
to reach 2.1% of GDP in 2014.

In spite of the deteriorating macroeconomic
situation, the general government deficit is
projected to improve to 2.9% of GDP in 2013 on
the back of consolidation measures (1.3 pps. of
GDP), spread equally on the revenue and
expenditure side. The main measures include
across-the-board cuts in government consumption,
lower indexation of pensions and an increase in
both VAT rates and the personal income tax rate.
A temporary gift tax on emission allowances
(0.1 pp. of GDP) expires in 2013. After reaching a

The fiscal forecast is subject to risks related to a
higher-than-expected participation in the fullyfunded pension pillar and to larger-than-planned
deficits at regional level. On the upside, one-off
revenues related to the planned auction of new
telecom frequency bands could result in a betterthan-expected budgetary outcome in 2013.

4. DENMARK
Economy getting back on track
Economy gaining momentum in 2013

In 2012 the Danish economy experienced a
contraction of 0.5% of GDP, despite positive
developments in both domestic demand and
exports. The increase in demand was, however,
offset by increased imports and a reduction of
inventories.
The growth outlook for 2013 remains positive,
with an expected GDP growth rate of 0.7%. The
annual growth rate is highly influenced by a
negative carry-over effect from a slowdown at the
end of 2012, which is also an important factor
behind the downward adjustment compared to the
2013 winter forecast.
The pick-up in activity in 2013 is expected to be
fuelled by domestic demand. Private consumption
is projected to grow moderately, supported by the
low interest rates and positive effects on
disposable income from the recent tax reform.
However, Danish households are still reluctant to
spend, reflecting continued consolidation efforts in
the aftermath of the financial crisis and the
significant correction in the Danish housing
market.

External balance of goods and services
Change in inventories + net acq. of valuables

The weak external demand is expected to impose a
drag on GDP growth in 2013. This is primarily
related to developments in Danish export markets,
since the Danish cost-competiveness has improved
over the last couple of years.
The weak cyclical development in the years
following the financial crisis has taken its toll on
the labour market. The unemployment rate has
stayed stable at around 7.5% for the last three
years, and is expected to stay broadly at the same
level in the forecast period. This is a relatively
high level by Danish standards, but lower than
during previous periods of cyclical weakness
owing to a continuous improvement of the labour
market structures over the last two decades.
Employment has surprised on the positive side in
2012, but the drop in economic activity by the end
of the year is expected to have delayed negative
effects on employment in the first half of 2013.
However, the gradual pick-up in economic growth
in the course of this year is expected to be
sufficient to ensure a gradual turnaround in the
labour market in the second half of 2013.
Price competitiveness supporting exports

HICP inflation is expected to ease further in 2013
to 1.4% due to weak underlying price pressures
and excise tax cuts. Wage growth has been
moderate, reflecting the slack in the labour market.
The continued weak recovery in the labour market
from the second half of this year is expected to
contain wage growth going forward.
External price competitiveness is projected to
improve further in the forecast period due to
moderate growth in unit labour costs compared to
Denmark's neighbouring countries. This is
expected to support the external balance of goods
and services, which has diminished in the last
couple of years.

Domestic demand (excl. Inventories)
GDP at market prices (rhs)

The 'investment window' tax breaks – which will
continue until the end of the year – provide
incentives for businesses to move their investments
forward to 2013. This is expected to lead to a
temporary boost to investment.

48

The risks to the macroeconomic outlook appear to
be broadly balanced. High saving rates in the
private sector in Denmark, especially in the nonfinancial business sector, may support upside
surprises in domestic demand growth, in the case
of a more pronounced turnaround in confidence in
the coming quarters. However, Denmark is a small

Member States, Denmark

open economy, and developments are highly
dependent on developments in the rest of the EU.

of the business tax rate and lower growth in public
consumption from 2014 to 2020. However, as the
negotiations on this plan have not been concluded
by the cut-off date of the forecast, the effects –
which for 2014 are assessed to be positive, both on
the headline fiscal balance and to a smaller degree
on the real economy – have not been included in
this forecast.

Public finances are set to improve

The fiscal balance is expected to be -1.7% of GDP
in 2013 and to deteriorate to -2.7% in 2014. The
estimate has improved significantly compared to
the winter forecast, due to an upward revision of
the estimated revenues coming from the
opportunity to move forward taxation of existing
capital pension schemes at favourable conditions
in 2013 as a part of the tax reform. In the Danish
Government's "Growth Plan" from February 2013,
the capital pension taxation measure has been
proposed to be extended to 2014, which would
then have a significant positive one-off effect on
the fiscal balance also in 2014.

The structural balance is projected to deteriorate
from 0.3% of GDP in 2012 to 0.0% of GDP in
2013 and -0.3% in 2014. Excluding volatile items,
such as revenues from North Sea oil extraction and
from the pension yield taxes, the structural balance
is set to improve over the forecast horizon with an
average annual fiscal effort of 0.5% of GDP from
2011 to 2013.
The general government gross debt is expected to
remain at a relatively low level, close to 45% of
GDP in 2013-14.

The "Growth Plan", which the Danish authorities
claim is fiscally neutral, also contains a reduction

Reacceleration of economic growth on the horizon
Economic activity
momentum

expected

to

regain

In 2012, real GDP increased by 0.7%. After a
gradual weakening of economic activity in the
second and third quarters, subdued consumption
growth and restocking of inventories were not
sufficient to offset the strong decline in exports
and the continued deterioration in equipment
investment. As a result, GDP dropped abruptly by
0.6% q-o-q (seasonally and working-day adjusted)
in the final quarter.
Indicators suggest that the recent setback was
temporary and that a stabilisation took place in the
first quarter of this year. While the protracted
winter weighed on construction activity and
industrial production remained weak in the first
two months of the year, services are likely to have
stimulated GDP growth. Firms' business
expectations point towards a recovery of economic
activity, which might be bolstered by weatherrelated catching-up effects, but industry orders are
not yet fully supporting such expectations.
The labour market has remained remarkably robust
against the background of weakened economic
activity. Together with firms' strong international
competitiveness and the expected improving
external environment, the preconditions are in
place for economic activity to regain momentum in
the course of this year. Overall, real GDP is
projected to grow by 0.4% in 2013 and by 1.8% in
2014, which is 0.1 pp. and 0.2 pp. less,
respectively, than predicted by the winter forecast.
Investments likely to recover in the course of
this year

Domestic orders of capital goods have passed their
2012 trough on the back of favourable financing
conditions and a positive outlook for exports and
private
consumption.
Moreover,
domestic
investment plans have stabilised recently, after
having deteriorated more strongly than those for
industry projects abroad. Hence, the period of
declining equipment investment appears to be
coming to an end. Nevertheless, the weak starting
position is weighing on full-year growth and
capacity investments are likely to gain in
importance only in the medium term. Low interest
rates, rising wages and robust labour market

50

developments should continue to underpin housing
investment and private consumption over the
forecast horizon.
Contribution of net exports to GDP growth
projected to decrease

Export expectations have brightened noticeably,
although external orders for industrial goods have
dropped back again. Import growth should
increase more strongly than export growth once
equipment investments pick up. Safe haven-effects
might have contributed to the strong rise in the
current-account surplus last year. In contrast,
returning confidence in foreign financial assets,
along with dissipating uncertainty, should
contribute to reducing the surplus over the forecast
horizon.

Robust labour demand keeps pushing the
unemployment rate lower

Employment is forecast to expand further, but at a
slower pace, given the scope for restoring hours
worked per employee. The rise in labour demand
is projected to exceed the increase in labour supply
due to considerable net migration and the sustained
upward trend in labour market participation. This
is reflected in a slight but ongoing reduction in the
unemployment rate this year and next. Stronger
wage growth and no further changes in the pension
contribution rate, following significant reductions
in 2012 and 2013, are expected to lead to an
acceleration of growth in compensation per
employee in 2014.

Member States, Germany

deficit of 0.2% of GDP in 2013 and to be balanced
in 2014. The structural budget balance is projected
to stabilise at a surplus of around ½% of GDP,
implying that Germany should meet its mediumterm budgetary objective of a structural deficit no
higher than 0.5% of GDP over the forecast
horizon.

Inflation on the wane

Inflation is forecast to remain moderate at 1.8% in
2013 and 1.6% in 2014. Headline inflation and
core inflation are projected to develop in opposite
directions, resulting in particular from the
gradually rising scope for passing on higher labour
costs to consumers on the one hand and lower
price pressure from energy and food components
on the other hand.

Given the broadly balanced budget, the
denominator effect of GDP growth is expected to
lower the gross debt ratio from 81.9% of GDP in
2012 to 81.1% of GDP in 2013 and 78.6% of GDP
in 2014. The on-going winding up of "bad banks"
could further reduce the debt stock.

Broadly neutral fiscal stance and structural
budget balance at the medium-term objective

The weaker economic activity at the end of last
year has led to a deceleration in the growth rate of
tax receipts, notably with respect to profit-related
taxes. Moreover, revenue growth is projected to be
slowed down by the reduction of the pension
contribution rate, the increase in the minimum
income tax allowance and the abolition of the
quarterly fee for medical treatments. Additional
expenditure in 2013 and 2014 is expected to result
from recent wage agreements in the public sector
at Länder level and a new childcare allowance for
parents not making use of childcare facilities.
Overall, after a small surplus in 2012, the general
government budget is forecast to turn into a slight

6. ESTONIA
Balanced growth path ahead
GDP growth is becoming more balanced…

Sound fiscal policy combined with remarkable
adjustment capacity of the economy has supported
Estonia’s resilience to the sovereign-debt crisis.
Estonia’s 3.2% economic growth in 2012 was
supported by robust domestic demand and
moderate export growth. In 2013, the forecast real
GDP growth of 3% is expected to be more
balanced and continues converging to its long-term
average trend, reaching 4% in 2014. Risks to the
forecast appear broadly balanced and mainly
related to the external sector.

Nevertheless, the high loan stock will likely
remain a drag on credit growth.
Consumption growth was firm throughout 2012,
supported by rapidly falling unemployment,
increasing real wages and consumer confidence
above the long-term average. Households’
financial situation is improving as the real income
is forecast to increase. Nevertheless, the growth in
retail trade has decelerated somewhat during the
first months of this year. All in all, private
consumption growth is expected to decelerate from
4.4% in 2012 to 3.3% in 2013, and to accelerate
only slightly to 3.5% in 2014.

... as export growth regains momentum…

Industrial production volumes broadly stagnated
last year. As, in the first quarter, employment
continued to grow, this fed into a moderate
increase in unit labour costs. However, in the
course of the year, electronic production and
exports regained momentum,
while the
manufacturing sector reduced its workforce. As a
result, productivity growth reverted to positive
values in manufacturing, limiting thereby the
growth differential with wages in the economy as a
whole. Expectations are that the relatively good
economic performance of Russia and the resilience
of the Nordic countries to the sovereign-debt crisis
will have a positive effect on Estonia’s foreign
trade. Based on a progressive recovery of Estonia's
main trading partners from mid-2013, export
growth is expected to continue supporting GDP,
with a strong trade surplus in services still largely
offsetting a persistent trade deficit in goods.
... and domestic demand moderates…

Domestic demand was robust in 2012, supported
by a favourable labour market situation and strong
fixed investment. Investment growth is forecast to
slow down from 21% in 2012 to 3% this year. The
major reasons for this slowdown are the
contraction in public investment as the majority of
projects financed through the revenue from the
sale of excess greenhouse gas emission certificates
will end and that EU co-funded projects have been
completed. In 2013, corporate investment is
expected to offset the fall in public investment as
export possibilities are set to expand. Backed by
low interest rates and recovering lending activity,
private-sector deleveraging is coming to a halt.

remains

broadly

The unemployment rate (age 15-74) continued to
decline rapidly to 9.3% in the fourth quarter of
2012 as output growth rebounded. The labour
force participation rate remained historically high
and is projected to increase further due to the
changing age structure. Employment growth has
been sustained at 2.6% in 2012, but has
decelerated in recent quarters due mainly to mixed
economic developments in the euro area, but also
to the annual winter effect. Nominal wage growth
is expected to stabilise at around 5.7% in 2013 and
6.1% in 2014, with real wage growth increasingly
positive at 2.1% in 2013 and 3.0% in 2014. Even
though lower in the second half of 2012, vacancy
rates may soon start increasing again, while skill
mismatches may become more visible, reigniting
fears of excessive wage increases, declining
competitiveness and lower output growth.

Member States, Estonia

considerably better than the deficit of 2.6% of
GDP initially targeted.
In 2013, a combination of additional one-off
factors and increasing expenditure pressures are
likely to prevent a further improvement in the
budget deficit, which is expected to remain at 0.3%
of GDP. A one-off capital injection into the
national airline company, currently in financial
difficulties, is estimated to increase the state
expenditure by 0.3% of GDP in 2013. The
unfreezing of the public wage bill, a pension
increase of 5% and a cut in the unemployment
insurance premium will add further pressures to
the budget balance this year. In 2014, as the effect
of these one-off factors fades out, fiscal balance is
projected to revert to a surplus of 0.2% of GDP.

…and inflation continues its slow decline

With the impact of earlier global commodity price
increases progressively fading out, monthly HICP
inflation further receded to 3.8% y-o-y in March
2013. Inflation is expected to decline further to
3.6% for 2013 as a whole, despite administrative
changes on 1 January that are pushing prices up:
most importantly, increases by 5-6% in alcohol
and tobacco excises and the full opening of
Estonia's electricity market, which has been
accompanied by higher transfer fees. The
introduction of free public transport for Tallinn
residents is offsetting price increases to some
extent. Overall, declining global commodity prices
in 2013 and 2014 are assumed to ensure that
inflation will continue its slow decline. Although
core inflation is relatively low, it might soon start
increasing as the unemployment rate has already
passed below the natural rate of unemployment.

Net of cyclical and one-off effects, the general
government structural balance reached a surplus of
0.2% of GDP in 2012 and is forecast to fluctuate
around balance thereafter. Contribution to the
EFSF and the ESM is the main reason for the
4 pps. increase in the public debt to 10.1% of GDP
in 2012. Public debt is forecast to increase
marginally to 10.2% of GDP in 2013 before it

Public finances in order

With strong tax-revenue collection and smaller
than expected expenditure, the general government

7. IRELAND
Completing the two-thirds of its adjustment programme with
encouraging economic performance
2012 GDP growth slightly above expectations

Positive financial market sentiment

Real GDP grew by 0.9% in 2012, somewhat higher
than the 2013 winter forecast of 0.7%. The positive
performance resulted from expected developments
in domestic demand. Private consumption fell by
0.9% in annual terms, almost a full percentage
point less than expected, on the back of modest
but positive annual growth in the second half of
2012. Gross fixed capital formation expanded by
1.1% after contracting by double-digit figures for
four consecutive years. While it was mainly driven
by investment in aircrafts, other investment
categories also appeared to have bottomed out.
Nominal GDP grew by 2.9% in 2012, supported by
favourable terms of trade developments, while
inflation pressures have continued to abate.

Strong investor interest has resulted in declining
yields on Irish sovereign bonds, both in primary
and secondary markets, as especially evident from
the widely oversubscribed mid-March issuance of
a new 10-year benchmark bond, the first since the
start of the economic adjustment programme.
Banks have continued to access market funding on
attractive terms, which together with continued
deposit inflows and progress with deleveraging,
has led to the lowest level of Eurosystem funding
since the beginning of the programme. Despite
these improvements in banks' funding, extension
of credit to the domestic economy remains weak,
implying continuously weak demand for credit.

Industrial production grew steadily during the
three months to February 2013 compared to a year
earlier, driven by partial reversals of the weak
performance of high-tech and chemical companies
seen during the second half of 2012. At the same
time, the most recent survey indicators such as
manufacturing and services PMIs suggest that a
more subdued performance can be expected going
forward. Retail sales, services indices and housing
market indicators have also been relatively weak
with small but negative annual growth rates in the
beginning of 2013. While unemployment fell to
14.0% in February according to the monthly Live
Register, the trend continues to be driven more by
a shrinking labour force than by major
employment creation.

The forecasts for real GDP growth in 2013-14 are
left unchanged compared to the 2013 winter
forecast,
albeit
with
slightly
different
compositions. Given the more favourable outturns
in 2012, the negative contribution of domestic
demand in 2013 is expected to be smaller, with
nearly flat growth in private consumption and
positive investment growth. Downgrades of
trading partner demand compared to the time of
the winter forecast is projected to constitute a drag
on goods exports in particular and result in a
somewhat smaller external surplus throughout the
forecast horizon. Unemployment is set to be lower
than in earlier projections, but mainly on account
of stronger-than-expected emigration flows. Risks
around the baseline scenario are broadly balanced,
with faster-than-expected financial sector repair
posing an upside risk to private consumption
through working off the debt overhang, while
more-adverse-than-projected
trading
partner
demand developments or spillovers from
vulnerable euro-area countries could subtract from
growth.

External performance strong in 2012

The current-account surplus surged to 4.9% of
GDP in 2012, reflecting not only the contraction in
domestic demand, but also the competitiveness
gains achieved through increased productivity,
inflation below the euro-area average, and costcutting measures including on wages. Persistent
weakness in trading partner demand is nevertheless
affecting demand for merchandise exports, which
contracted on a quarterly basis in the last two
quarters of 2012, also on account of the anticipated
expiration of pharmaceutical patents. The rise in
services exports, which have expanded by around
10% in annual terms every quarter since the
second half of 2010, has however substituted for
weak goods export developments.

54

Growth outlook stable but more broad-based

Tight 2013 fiscal position set to improve in 2014

The fiscal deficit stood at 7.6% of GDP in 2012
and is projected at 7.5% in 2013. (19) The
significant fiscal adjustment effort of 2.5% of GDP
budgeted in 2013 is projected to deliver only a
(19)

The deficit forecast is net of one-off financial sector
support measures, as such measures are excluded from the
EDP deficit ceilings for Ireland.

Member States, Ireland

muted improvement in the EDP deficit due to
increasing debt-servicing costs and the effects of
some one-off operations. A step increase in the
interest expenditure by 1.3 pps. of GDP reflects the
end of the grace period for interest payments on
the promissory notes and continued accumulation
of debt. The primary balance is expected to
improve at a more moderate pace on the back of
one-off revenues in 2012 from the sale of mobile
phone licenses (0.4% of GDP), a drop in revenues
from Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) after the
discontinuation of the scheme in March 2013
(0.4%) and one-off ELG claim payments to the
covered creditors of Irish Bank Resolution
Corporation (IBRC) (0.6%).(20) The upward
revision in the 2013 deficit by 0.2% of GDP as
compared to the 2013 winter forecast reflects
lower base-effect from the December 2012 tax
revenue surprise and higher one-off costs linked to
the IBRC liquidation than previously estimated.
The fiscal performance in the first quarter of
2013was broadly in line with plans and the same is
expected for the year as a whole. However, risks to
the 2013 budget includes (i) possibly higher oneoff cost of IBRC liquidation, (ii) the payment of
(20)

Allied Irish Banks (AIB) dividends on preference
shares held by the government via the issuance of
ordinary shares may be reclassified as deficitincreasing transfers as was the case in 2012 (0.2%
of GDP) and (iii) the planned wage bill savings of
0.2% of GDP still need to be effectively
implemented after the rejection of the initial
agreement by the public service unions. In 2014,
the EDP deficit is projected to decline to 4.3% of
GDP, driven by (i) the fiscal adjustment measures
of 1.4% of GDP to be detailed in the 2014 budget
in October and (ii) an ongoing expenditure freeze.
Moreover, the full positive effect of the promissory
note exchange will be realised once the IBRCliquidation-related transaction costs are settled
later in 2013. The government debt-to-GDP ratio
increased from 106% in 2011 to 118% in 2012.
The increase in debt is driven by a still high fiscal
deficit, sizeable financial transfers and an
accumulation of precautionary cash balances,
which stood at around 12% of GDP at end-2012.
The debt is projected to peak at 123% of GDP in
2013 and to decline thereafter as primary surpluses
are achieved and economic growth picks up.

Eurostat is examining the statistical treatment of the
liquidation of IBRC and the restructuring of the promissory
notes and their impact on the government deficit and debt.

8. GREECE
Contraction combined with a rebound in confidence
expected to start expanding again in 2014 with
annual GDP growth of 0.6%.

Is 2013 the last year of recession?

Greece entered the sixth consecutive year of
recession in 2013, but a recovery is expected to
start by the turn of the year, supported by
improved confidence and the return of liquidity.
While hard data is still generally negative, softer
survey indicators continue to improve since the relaunch of the adjustment programme last autumn.
Confidence is supported by the achievement of
fiscal targets despite the recession, by the high
credibility of the recently-legislated reforms and
measures supporting the fiscal adjustment, by
strong improvements in cost competitiveness and
by the return of deposits and liquidity to the
banking system following significant EU/IMF
disbursements and debt-reducing measures.
Nevertheless, in the short run, growth for 2013 is
still projected to contract by 4.2%, due to a
strongly negative carry-over. The high level of
unemployment together with cuts in wages and
social transfers will continue depressing private
consumption. Investment is likely to continue
underperforming in the short run, as the majority
of businesses still face liquidity constraints.

Inflation (rhs)

The repayment of government arrears, planned to
amount to 4% of GDP in 2013, and the faster
absorption of the EU and EIB funds through major
projects involving foreign lending consortia, could
alleviate liquidity constraints. The bank
recapitalisation process
and
the
overall
stabilisation of the economy are setting the
preconditions for a return of capital to the country.
Against this background, domestic demand is

56

The unemployment rate has increased sharply,
reaching 24.3% in 2012 and is forecast to rise to
27.0% in 2013, as falling aggregate demand offsets
sharp reductions in labour costs. Structural reforms
in wage setting have already contributed to sharp
reductions in unit labour costs and improving
competitiveness. Thus unemployment is expected
to decrease to 26.0% in 2014 as the economy picks
up.
The current-account deficit is projected to further
decrease in 2013. In 2012, this adjustment was
driven largely by declining imports. A rebound in
exports is expected in 2013. Pre-booking data
already suggest an improvement in tourism
receipts for summer 2013. In addition, the agreed
government debt restructuring measures will
improve the primary income balance through
lowering interest payments.
Inflation continues the deceleration that started in
2010. Consumer prices are expected to fall
moderately by 0.8% in 2013 and 0.4% in 2014,
reflecting weak domestic demand, falling ULCs
and the implementation of product market reforms.
The fiscal position continues to improve

While the headline general government deficit
amounted to almost 10% of GDP in 2012, this
reflected one-off costs of almost 4.0% of GDP
associated with the resolution of three banks last
year. Net of these one-off measures, despite
continued headwind from the deep recession,
Greece is estimated to have achieved a slightly
better fiscal outcome than expected for 2012.
On the basis of measures taken in November 2012
in the context of the programme, Greece is
expected to achieve primary balance in 2013,
contingent on the effective implementation of the
budget. However, the bank recapitalisation taking
place in the first half of 2013 will have a very
significant impact on the headline deficit compared
to the figure currently forecast (this impact will
instead change the current debt projections only
marginally as the latter already include the funds
borrowed to carry out the bank recapitalisation).
The exact nature and size of such impact on the

Member States, Greece

deficit depends on the ultimate form of the
operations, which were not yet finalised at the cutoff date. The forecast does not take into account
the equivalent of SMP profits transferred by euroarea Member States to Greece as the statistical
treatment is under consideration. Interest payments
are lower than expected in the winter forecast, due
to lower short-term interest rates.

In 2014, the fiscal balance is expected to improve

In structural terms, the improvement is even more
significant over the forecast period, leading to a
projected structural balance of 2% of GDP in
2014, up from some-14¾% in 2009, reflecting a
clear turnaround in the fiscal position compared to
the beginning of the crisis.

Risks to the baseline outlook

On the upside, a faster return in confidence or a
stronger impact of liquidity infusions through
arrears clearance could lead to an earlier recovery
than predicted. On the downside, slippage with
policy
implementation
could
undermine
confidence. Furthermore, interest projections
reflect very low short-term interest rates, which
could increase earlier than expected.

The ratio of public debt to GDP is expected to rise
in 2013. However, from 2014 and onwards, the
debt ratio is projected to decline at an accelerating
pace as the fiscal balance continues improving and
economic growth resumes.

Adjustment to continue weighing on growth and employment
Correction of imbalances remains a drag on
domestic demand

The rebalancing from domestic demand towards
external demand intensified towards the end of
2012, partly due to transitory factors (indirect tax
rate hikes and a temporary reduction of public
wages). The rebalancing is expected to continue
over the forecast horizon. Domestic demand is
likely to remain weak, while cost competitiveness
should improve gradually and exports maintain
their momentum. As a result, in 2013 Spain is
expected to post a current-account surplus for the
first time since 1997.
Financial conditions are likely to remain a drag on
economic growth in the near future. The necessary
restructuring of the banking sector and the weak
growth outlook are expected to imply continued
tight credit conditions for other domestic sectors in
the short term, thus constraining private
consumption and investment decisions.
Real GDP is forecast to contract by 1.5% in 2013,
slightly more than in 2012. This negative growth
figure is influenced by a large carry-over effect
from 2012 (close to 1 pp.). The quarterly profile is
projected to be more benign, with GDP stabilising
towards the end of 2013, as the contraction of
domestic demand moderates. GDP is expected to
expand by about 1% in 2014 under the no-policychange assumption, i.e. not taking into account the
effect of the fiscal consolidation needed to
underpin the official target for 2014.
Net exports to remain the only source of
growth

Domestic demand will still be weighed down by
the unwinding of the imbalances accumulated
during the expansion period and the frictions
associated with this adjustment process. Thus,
private consumption is expected to contract at a
faster pace as a result of continued household
deleveraging, high unemployment and falling real
disposable income. These factors led the
household saving rate to fall to historically low
levels in 2012 (around 8% of gross disposable
income), even as private consumption contracted
significantly. Negative wage growth contributed to
this development in 2012.

58

Private investment is expected to contract
significantly in 2013 as a result of weak demand
prospects, corporate balance-sheet adjustment and
difficult access to credit, notably for SMEs.
Despite having fallen in 2012 to just 5% of its
2006 level, the number of housing starts does not
seem to have bottomed out yet and residential
investment is set to contract further.
Thanks to improving cost competitiveness and
increasing geographical diversification mainly
towards emerging-market economies, exports have
been growing faster than export markets, partially
offsetting the weakness in the euro area. This trend
is expected to continue over the forecast horizon.
Together with the contraction of imports due to
subdued domestic demand, it should lead to a
further increase in the surplus in the balance for
goods and services.

Wage moderation to support employment and
dampen inflation

Unemployment rose to 26% of the workforce at
the end of 2012, as the contraction in employment
deepened. Wage moderation intensified in 2012,
partly as a result of additional public sector wage
cuts. The increased sensitivity of wages to labour
market conditions, one of the key objectives of the
2012 reform of the labour market, should
contribute to moderate the fall in employment.
Nevertheless, the unemployment rate is forecast to
continue to rise to 27% on average in 2013.
Strong labour productivity growth, together with
continued wage moderation, should further reduce

to fall significantly towards the end of 2013 once

consumption patterns and the slump in housing
transactions), falling employment and labour
income, and negative asset price developments.
Additional revenue-raising measures introduced
throughout the year largely offset these shortfalls.
In 2013, the general government deficit (net of
bank recapitalisations) is expected to narrow to
6.5% of GDP, thanks to discretionary measures of
around 2.5% of GDP, which more than offset the
negative budgetary impact of the continued
recession and population ageing. Higher VAT
revenues and expenditure savings should outweigh
higher expenditure on social transfers and interest.
Despite the return to positive, albeit weak, growth
in 2014, the general government deficit is expected
to widen to 7% of GDP, as some of the measures
introduced in 2012 would expire (against an
official target of 5.5% of GDP). In such a nopolicy-change assumption, the structural deficit is
estimated to be back at its 2012 level in 2014.

Recession and structural adjustments take their
toll on government revenues

With the entry into force of the additional
consolidation measures taken during the year
(increase in VAT, elimination of the Christmas
bonus in the public sector, corporate tax
measures), budgetary consolidation advanced in
the final months of 2012. Also at regional level,
expenditure cuts in the area of education had their
main impact in the last quarter. For the year as a
whole, the deficit narrowed to 7.0% of GDP, down
from 8.9% in 2011, net of bank recapitalisations in
both years. The latter amounted to around 3.6% of
GDP in 2012 according to the April 2013 EDP
notification.

Large public deficits, low nominal GDP growth
and bank recapitalisation costs are projected to
raise the general government gross debt by more
than 12 pps. to 96.8% of GDP between 2012 and
2014.

The budgetary performance in 2012 was blighted
by considerable shortfalls of both indirect and
direct tax revenues, linked to negative composition

Weak growth, high headline deficits
Stagnation to continue this year

Further decrease in investment

After a standstill in 2012, GDP is projected to
slightly decrease by 0.1% in 2013. The weakness
of households' real disposable income linked in
particular to rising unemployment and tax
increases would only be partially offset by
decelerating prices, while persistent unfavourable
entrepreneurs' confidence is expected to lead to a
continued fall in investment. Economic activity is
expected to pick up modestly from the second half
of the year on the back of a marginal rebound of
the external sector. This would trigger a certain
revival of economic agents' confidence, which is
set to translate into positive growth in 2014,
reaching 1.1% for the year as a whole. This
positive development next year is based on the nopolicy change assumption, i.e. excluding the effect
of the fiscal consolidation measures still needed to
reach the budgetary targets.

Flat economic growth in 2012, continued projected
weak demand and the enduring deterioration in
profit margins of non-financial companies are
likely to dent entrepreneurs’ expectations.
Therefore, corporate investment is set to decrease
further in 2013. Only in 2014, the gradual increase
in aggregate demand and improved confidence are
expected to translate into a turnaround in
investment.

Although exports have been relatively dynamic in
2012, thanks in particular to buoyant aeronautic
sales, developments over the forecast horizon are
expected to remain somewhat weaker than world
demand. Indeed, the persistent deterioration in
external competitiveness is likely to go on in the
short term. Still, sluggish imports in 2013 are
expected to lead to a positive contribution of net
exports to GDP growth. In 2014, accelerating
world demand would be more than offset by the
gradual domestic recovery, and the related rise in
imports. As a result, net exports are set to
contribute slightly negatively to growth.

Stable private consumption

In 2013, private consumption is expected to remain
flat, as in 2012, as slightly decreasing real
disposable income is likely to be partly cushioned
by lower inflation. In addition, the new taxes
introduced by the government in its 2013 budget
have been targeted towards high-income
households, who have a lower propensity to
consume, in order to limit their impact on domestic
demand. In 2014, the recovery in real disposable
income is expected to allow private consumption
spending to grow modestly.

unemployment,

decreasing

Employment started decreasing in 2012, while the
unemployment rate rose rapidly to 10.5% in the
fourth quarter, against 9.8% one year before. In the
current context of stagnating economic activity and
rigid nominal wages, employers are likely to focus
more on restoring productivity, to the detriment of
job creation. Despite efforts to reform the labour
market, unemployment is expected to continue
rising to 10.6% and 10.9% in 2013 and 2014.
After a relatively high level inflation rate in 2012,
HICP is set to decelerate to 1.2% in 2013 due to
lower energy prices before accelerating again to
1.7% in 2014, against the background of VAT
increases.
Some uncertainties remain

Risks to the forecast are broadly balanced. On the
one hand, a stronger-than-expected recovery could

result from a quicker effect of structural reforms
on investment. On the other hand, a further
deterioration of firms' competitiveness and a
possible loss in confidence resulting from higher
deficit outcomes might threaten a fragile recovery.

also help contain expenditure. However, GDP
growth projected well below potential will
negatively affect the headline deficit. Overall, it is
expected to reach 3.9% of GDP, 0.2 pp. higher
than predicted in the winter forecast, notably
reflecting last year's final outcome and the
downward revision of growth prospects.

Structural adjustment only partly reflected in
headline deficits

Under
the
customary
no-policy-change
assumption, the deficit is forecast to slightly
deteriorate in 2014. Indeed, part of the measures
aimed at funding the recent corporate tax credit
compétitivité-emploi are yet to be specified in
sufficient detail and a number of one-off tax
payments will expire at end-2013.

The general government deficit reached 4.8% of
GDP last year, down from 5.3% in 2011 (revised
from 5.2%), falling short of the 4.5% official
target. The 2013 winter forecast had expected a
figure of 4.6% of GDP. The difference mainly
stems the cost of bailing out Dexia and the upward
revision of the deficit for 2011.

Overall, this implies a cumulated improvement in
the structural balance of around 2½ pps. of GDP in
the period 2012-13. At unchanged policies, the
latter is expected to remain broadly stable in 2014.

The headline deficit is set to decrease further this
year on the back of the measures adopted notably
as part of the budget. The overall amount of
revenue measures is estimated at 1.4% of GDP.
Current expenditure rules (central government and
healthcare) are renewed and this will contribute to
maintaining spending restraint. A lower-thanpreviously-projected inflation and the partial

The debt ratio, which slightly exceeded 90% of
GDP last year, is expected to continue to rise over

High uncertainty weighs on recovery prospects
Economic activity continues contracting

Economic activity has been declining since the
second half of 2011 and real GDP dropped by
2.4% in 2012 as a whole. Private consumption
recorded an unprecedented contraction, by more
than 4%, as a consequence of the large decline in
real disposable income. Government consumption
also detracted from growth on the back of the
sizeable fiscal consolidation. High uncertainty on
demand prospects and tight financing conditions
restrained private investment. The only demand
component showing a positive sign was exports,
thanks to extra-EU demand. This, together with the
collapse in imports, stemmed the decline in GDP.
Real GDP is projected to contract by a further
1.3% in 2013, on the back of persistent uncertainty
and continued difficult access to credit. There are
no clear signs of a recovery in the short term as
consumer and business confidence remain in
negative territory, pointing to still contracting
economic activity in the first half of the year. The
settlement of government trade debt arrears is
expected to support a mild recovery as from the
third quarter of 2013. This is due to its immediate
impact on public investment, while the improved
liquidity conditions for firms will gradually deploy
their benefit to the economy over the forecast
horizon. In the absence of renewed tensions in
financial markets and with improving confidence,
private consumption and investment are set to
stabilise in the second half of 2013. In 2014, the
gradual improvement in financing conditions
supports domestic demand, especially investment
in equipment. On the external side, the projected
acceleration in global trade spurs exports,
especially towards non-EU trade partners. Imports,
after contracting further in 2013, are expected to
start growing again in 2014 as domestic demand
resumes.
Overall, real GDP is anticipated to expand by 0.7%
in 2014. Following its steady improvement since
mid-2011, the external balance is expected to turn
positive in 2013 driven by the trade balance, and
then stabilise at around 1% of GDP in 2014.
Labour market adjusts and inflation declines

The unemployment rate reached 10.7% in 2012,
from 8.4% in 2011, mainly due to an increasing

62

number of people entering the labour force while
headcount job losses were still limited. Labour
shedding is expected to continue in 2013, while a
stabilisation is projected in 2014. The
unemployment rate is thus set to increase further,
to 12.2%, by the end of the forecast horizon. The
continued freeze of public wages combined with
moderate wage growth in the private sector points
to a deceleration in unit labour costs over 2013-14.

HICP (rhs)

After 3.3% in 2012, HICP inflation is rapidly
decelerating. It is expected to average 1.6% in
2013 as a whole despite the planned 1 pp. increase
in the VAT standard rate (to 22%) as from July.
The dampening effects of weak demand, falling
energy prices as well as limited labour cost
pressures are expected to keep HICP inflation well
below 2% also in 2014.
Payments of trade debt arrears affect the
budgetary outcomes

In 2012, the general government deficit fell to
3.0% of GDP, from 3.8% in 2011. The primary
surplus doubled to 2.5% of GDP, while interest
expenditure increased by 0.5 pp., to 5.5% of GDP.
Primary expenditure contracted in nominal terms
year-on-year, for the third year in a row, thanks to
the enacted savings measures. Compensation of
public employees, intermediate consumption,
investment and subsidies to firms fell markedly,
while social transfers rose only moderately as the
pension reforms are delaying access to retirement
and pensions above three times the minimum do
not benefit from the indexation to inflation in
2012-13. Revenues rose by 2.5% y-o-y despite the
nominal GDP contraction. Higher taxation on

Member States, Italy

immovable property, also levied on owneroccupied residences, and further increases in
excise duties on fuel had a significant impact on
revenues. By contrast, despite the 1 pp. increase in
the standard rate as from September 2011, VAT
revenues declined as consumption – especially of
tax-rich durable goods – fell considerably.

The structural balance is projected to continue
improving in 2013, by around 1 pp. of GDP. Its
small negative reading is due to the additional
investment expenditure related to the settlement of
trade debt arrears. The structural primary balance
is expected to reach nearly 5% of GDP in 2013-14.
Graph II.11.2: Italy - Sectoral balances

In 2013 – based on a no-policy-change assumption
– the deficit is projected to decline marginally, to
2.9% of GDP. This projection incorporates the
government decision to settle public sector trade
debt arrears, which implies additional investment
expenditure amounting to around 0.5% of GDP
only this year. Consolidation measures continue to
have a positive impact on primary expenditure
dynamics, as the wage bill and intermediate
consumption are set to continue declining and the
increase in social transfers is kept in check.
Revenues are expected to rise faster than nominal
GDP growth thanks to the planned increases in
VAT and other indirect taxes, in particular stamp
duties on financial wealth. In 2014, the economic
recovery and the fading out of the impact of higher
investment expenditure are projected to lead to a
reduction in the deficit, to 2.5% of GDP, while the
primary surplus is set to increase to 3.1% of GDP.

12. CYPRUS
Recession deepens sharply as painful adjustments get underway
Economic activity contracted in 2012 …

2012 was marked by declining economic activity,
with real GDP falling by 2.4%. The contraction
was driven by a marked decline in domestic
consumption and investment activity, affected by
the
tightening
credit
conditions,
fiscal
consolidation, deteriorating labour
market
conditions, and very low consumer confidence.
The external sector contributed positively due to
good export performance and a strong contraction
of import volumes. On 12 April 2013, the
Eurogroup welcomed the staff-level agreement on
macroeconomic adjustment programme for
Cyprus, expecting formal approval by end of April
2013.

Unemployment rates jump to unprecedented
levels, while inflation declines

The profound contraction in economic activity is
expected to weigh on employment. Reduced
business activity, possible spillovers from the
restructuring of the banking sector to professional
business services and the hiring freeze in the
public sector are expected to push the
unemployment rate higher in 2013 and more so in
2014. Subdued domestic demand is projected to
lead to lower inflation in 2013 and 2014, offsetting
the imposed higher indirect taxes.

.. and will deteriorate sharply over 2013-14

5

In 2013, real GDP is expected to decline sharply
by 8.7%, affected in particular by the immediate
restructuring of the banking sector, which affects
net credit growth, fiscal consolidation, and the
high degree of economic uncertainty which weighs
on domestic demand and investment. In addition,
the temporary imposition of capital controls and
withdrawal restrictions are expected to hamper
international capital flows and to reduce business
volumes in both domestic and internationallyoriented companies. The bail-in of uninsured
depositors implies a loss of wealth, which will also
affect private consumption and investment.

0

The forecast points to the prolongation of
recession into 2014. On the back of deleveraging
by banks and the tight credit growth conditions,
gross fixed capital formation is expected to decline
further. Fiscal consolidation measures and rising
unemployment are projected to weigh strongly on
private consumption. The contraction in domestic
demand is expected to be mirrored by shrinking
imports over the forecast horizon. Little reprieve
could be expected from exports (tourism being
most promising) amid uncertain external
conditions and a shrinking financial services
sector. The current-account balance is set to
improve considerably given also the divestments in
the banking sector. Overall, the Cypriot economy
is expected to contract by around 15%
cumulatively in 2012-14.

Significant downside risks exist

Risks remain tilted to the downside.
Implementation of the agreed macroeconomic
adjustment programme could have a stronger
impact on the economy through domestic demand,
exports, business and consumer confidence. Also,
risks of household and corporate defaults
propagating through the economy may lead to
further losses in the banking sector and increased
unemployment. Upside risks relate to potential
investment activity in the energy sector.
Sizeable government deficit persists

The government deficit did not improve in 2012,
despite the sizeable consolidation measures
undertaken. While tax revenues decreased mainly
due to lower corporate profits in 2011, non-tax
revenues improved due to higher sales revenues.
Social contributions decreased in line with the
deterioration in labour market conditions. Overall,
expenditure slightly increased. Interest payments
increased due to borrowing difficulties leading to

Member States, Cyprus

higher interest rates and to higher debt, while
primary expenditure was reduced significantly.
While wages and salaries were reduced, social
benefits increased due to the wave of early
retirements prior to the MoU agreement. The oneoff payment to insurance companies related to the
2011 Vasilico explosion adversely affected other
current expenditures. In contrast, investment
expenditure decreased significantly keeping the
overall level of expenditure unchanged from 2011.

government fees, while the one-off signing fees
from licencing of plots for the exploitation of
natural gas will increase current revenues in 2013.
On the expenditure side, compensation of public
sector employees is expected to fall further due to
wages cuts and the hiring moratorium.
Intermediate consumption and social transfers are
also projected to fall while the interest bill will be
affected by the jump of the debt level. Public
investments are expected to remain at low levels,
while capital transfers and other current
expenditure are set to decline, reversing the oneoff expenditures in 2012. The structural balance is
expected to improve by 1¼% of GDP in 2013 and
to marginally improve in 2014.

In 2013 and 2014, revenue expectations are subject
to uncertainty arising from developments in the
financial sector. Revenues are expected to be held
back by the slump in the economic activity.
Despite the increase in direct taxation (measures
on corporate, interest income, and property tax),
the decline in economic activity is expected to lead
to worse revenues in 2013 than in 2012 and to a
faster worsening in 2014, as these taxes are
collected in the following year. Indirect tax
receipts are also expected to fall in both 2013 and
2014 in line with the reduction of domestic
consumption and despite the increases on the VAT
rates and on excise duties. Sales revenues are
foreseen to decrease despite the increase of

Debt in 2012 reached 85.8% of GDP, rising
noticeably from 2011, mainly due to the
government participation in the recapitalisation of
a commercial bank. During the forecast period,
debt-to-GDP is expected to rise to unprecedented
levels for Cyprus. Public debt developments are
projected to be largely influenced by the general
government deficit, the recapitalisation of some
financial institutions, notably the cooperative
credit institutions and the contraction of GDP.

Staying upbeat against the headwinds
Growth to remain among the highest in Europe

Despite the volatile external environment, the
Latvian economy retained a strong growth path.
GDP rose by 5.6% in 2012 marking a slight
acceleration from 5.5% in 2011. The most recent
high-frequency indicators, in particular industrial
and retail sales, confirm the previously expected
slowdown in 2013 but nevertheless the country is
still likely to remain among the fastest growing in
Europe. The economy is forecast to grow by 3.8%
in 2013 and 4.1% in 2014 amid broadly balanced
risks. Domestic demand and exports are projected
to expand at similar rates in 2013 while in 2014
exports are set to become again a primary growth
driver helped by better external environment. The
sound export performance is also expected to keep
the current-account deficit below 3% of GDP over
the forecast horizon.

Inflation drops further

After a significant slowdown in consumer price
inflation (HICP) to 2.3% in 2012 from 4.2% in
2011, the steep downward correction continued at
the beginning of 2013. In the first quarter of 2013,
the annual inflation rate decelerated to 0.4%. The
main disinflationary effect came from the
reduction in natural gas prices, linked to the ninemonth average of crude oil, which also had an
automatic impact on district heating fees. Prices
were also contained by the reduction in the VAT
standard rate by 1 pp. as of July 2012, new entrants
on the retail market, significant cuts in telecom
prices, and prudent fiscal spending. Inflation is
expected to pick up again on the back of the
forthcoming direct contracting of household
electricity supplies and improving domestic
demand which is likely to reactivate catching-up
sentiments. Still, the upward pressure is likely to
be offset by the ongoing energy efficiency
investments in district heating utilities with
projected downward effects on prices. In annual
average terms, the consumer-price inflation is
forecast at 1.4% in 2013 and 2.1% in 2014 amid
broadly balanced risks.

GDP growth (y-o-y%)

The quick recovery of the economy in 2011-12
brought most of the business sectors above the precrisis peak in 2007, including manufacturing,
mining and agriculture, while construction remains
well below its peak. However, in 2012 alone,
construction was again the fastest rising industry
(14.6%), followed by accommodation and catering
(10.8%), and manufacturing (9.3%). The economic
sector of agriculture, fisheries and forestry also
expanded strongly, by 6.9% in 2012, paced by an
exceptionally
good
grain
harvest.
Both
construction and agriculture benefited from very
favourable weather conditions in 2012, which was
not the case at the beginning of 2013. Therefore,

66

part of the forecast slowdown in 2013 reflects
possible negative base effects in the two sectors.

The number of registered job seekers dropped by
nearly 20% y-o-y in the first quarter of 2013
confirming the positive trends in the labour
market. While the labour force is currently on an
upward trend and the share of non-registered job
seekers may also rise, the unemployment rate is
still forecast to drop further to 13.7% in 2013 and
12.2% in 2014 as compared to 14.9% in 2011. The
latest economic sentiment surveys published by the
European Commission draw a largely favourable
picture of employment, though the pace of job
creation is likely to slow somewhat in line with the
GDP growth outlook for 2013. Therefore,
employment growth is set to weaken from 2.6% in
2012 to 1.9% in 2013 and 2.2% in 2014. The
vacancy rate remains quite low, at 0.4% in 2012,
as labour supply continues to exceed demand.

Member States, Latvia

revenue, while expenditure increase in the 2013
budget is limited and targeted. The pressure to
increase spending – especially in areas most
affected in the years of fiscal consolidation – is,
however, growing. Broadly the same pattern is
expected in 2014, when further personal income
tax rate reductions are compensated by
maintaining limits on social benefits in line with
legislation currently in force and by cyclical
improvements, resulting in the deficit of 0.9% of
GDP. Reflecting the impact of tax cuts and of
changes in the distribution of social contributions,
the structural deficit is expected to worsen by some
1 pp. of GDP in 2013 and remain broadly stable in
2014. One of the risks to the outlook in 2013-14
relates to a government guarantee given to an
industrial company in difficulties, with negative
impact on the deficit (and, indirectly, the debt)
amounting potentially to ¼ pp. of GDP if called in
full.

Low deficit outlook for public finances

The general government deficit declined to 1.2%
of GDP in 2012, compared with a deficit of 3.6%
in the preceding year. This outcome reflects strong
economic growth and the robust labour market
recovery, which led to better tax revenue and
lower unemployment costs. Tax revenue increased
by around 10% in 2012 – above the nominal GDP
growth – despite the mid-year VAT-rate cut by
1 pp., pointing also to improving tax efficiency.
Moreover, the increase in total (harmonised)
expenditure was considerably below GDP growth,
even taking into account one-off costs due to the
reclassification of a financial defeasance unit with
a negative impact of 0.5% of GDP. The structural
deficit, which excludes this one-off impact,
declined to 0.3% of GDP in 2012.
In 2013, the government deficit is expected to
remain broadly unchanged at 1.2% of GDP. This
includes a negative impact of tax changes – a 1 pp.
reduction in personal income tax rate from January
2013 and full-year impact of the 1 pp. reduction in
the standard VAT rate in mid-2012 – and of higher
state contributions to the privately managed funded
pension pillar. This negative impact is offset by
expectations of cyclical improvement in tax

The general government debt declined to 40.7% of
GDP in 2012 but is projected to increase again by
some 2½ pps. in 2013, as the government
accumulates assets for large debt repayments
scheduled for 2014-15. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to decrease again starting from 2014, as
these repayments take effect.

14. LITHUANIA
Return of confidence expected to nurture investment and growth
Previously strong domestic demand tailed off

Investment growth expected to resume in 2013

Real GDP expanded by 3.6% in 2012, driven by
net exports and private consumption. The latter
was initially the main growth engine, but lost
steam during the year. Gross fixed capital
formation contracted as companies delayed
investment and cut inventories due to uncertainty
stemming from the external environment and the
elections in autumn. Nevertheless, the slowing
domestic demand was offset by exceptionally high
net exports, supported by a record harvest. As a
result, the trade and current-account balances
improved significantly.

Looking ahead, investment is expected to pick up
and domestic demand is once again set to take over
as the main growth driver. Recent high-frequency
indicators signal a sustained improvement in
domestic economic sentiment. Credit is projected
to grow by 4% in 2013, interest rates are at a
historical low, and companies have significant
reserves to finance potential investment. In
addition, last year's export expansion pushed
capacity utilisation above its long-term average
and a majority of businesses indicated plans to
increase their investment in 2013. Public
investment will continue to be supported by EU
co-financed projects, although absorption of EU
funds is set to decrease. After a temporary
slowdown, private consumption growth is set to
accelerate in the second half of 2013 and beyond,
supported by an increased wage bill.

Conditions in the financial sector becoming
conducive to growth

Domestic credit growth in 2012 was limited, with
a high share attributed to credit to government and
financial intermediaries. Credit growth to nonfinancial corporations was still negative at the
beginning of 2012, but turned positive during the
year and grew at progressively increasing rates,
while
households continued
deleveraging.
Domestic and external uncertainty limited demand
for credit, while the supply side remained cautious
and focused on major corporations with strong
track record. The financial sector was tested once
again in early 2013, when the largest remaining
domestic bank Ukio bankas was declared insolvent
and its operation licence was revoked. The
supervisor handled the situation swiftly by a split
into a "bad" and a "good" bank and avoided any
negative repercussions for the financial sector and
the economy.

68

Gains in market shares and export growth are
projected to decelerate in 2013 since the effect of
last year's bumper harvest is fading out. However,
imports are expected to grow on the back of high
import propensity of consumption as well as
increasing demand for capital goods. Although net
exports are still expected to contribute positively to
growth in the first quarter of 2013 due to
remaining harvest stocks, the contribution is
projected to turn negative during the year and the
current-account deficit to widen slightly. This
trend is expected to continue in 2014.
Lithuania's real GDP is forecast to grow by 3.1%
in 2013 and by 3.6% in 2014 with limited and
balanced domestic risks. In particular, a delay in
the expected tax system reform beyond 2014 could
prolong current uncertainty and hold back
investment decisions. External risks are tilted to
the downside as a further slowdown in Russia
could have a negative, yet limited, impact on trade.
Inflation keeps moderating

Inflation (HICP) decreased to 3.2% in 2012
reflecting weaker growth in food and energy
prices. This trend is expected to prevail and HICP
is set to moderate further. It is forecast to decrease
to 2.1% in 2013 before picking up to 2.7% in
2014, when a reduced VAT rate applied to
residential heating is about to expire.

Member States, Lithuania

tax revenues were in line with 2012 plans and a
strong performance of the corporate sector resulted
in higher-than-expected corporate income tax
revenues, local governments were not able to
achieve their budget plans and had a higher deficit.
Overall, the general government deficit was
therefore slightly above the 3% target.

Real wages set to resume growth amid
dropping unemployment

Employment continued to grow in 2012 and the
unemployment rate decreased to 13.3%. Job
creation is expected to continue albeit at a slower
pace, in line with economic growth and an
increasing lack of skilled labour. The
unemployment rate is projected to decrease to
11.8% in 2013 and 10.5% in 2014. Real wage
growth is expected to turn positive in 2013 after
four years of contraction. Main supporting factors
are: lower inflation, the recent increase in the
minimum wage, and wage-pressures from
increasingly scarce high-skilled workers.

Last year's fiscal trends are projected to continue
in 2013. The current budget restricts expenditure
growth. The public sector wage freeze is extended
into 2013, but the minimum wage increase will
lead to a higher public sector wage bill. Stronger
personal income tax collection and social
contributions are projected to mostly offset this
increase. Higher excise duties on gasoline and
cigarettes are set to offset some smaller VAT
exemptions, but not an extension of reduced VAT
rates for residential heating and medicines. The
social insurance fund SoDra is expected to reduce
its deficit as the labour market improves.

Fiscal deficit improved, but below government
target

Lithuania’s general government deficit narrowed
to 3.2% of GDP in 2012 from 5.5% a year before,
supported by solid economic growth and
temporary expenditure cuts. Collection of indirect
taxes underperformed slightly due to weaker-thanexpected domestic consumption. State owned
enterprises only paid half of the expected
dividends to the budget. While personal income

The structural deficit is estimated to decrease from
3¼% of GDP in 2012 to 2¾% in 2013 and 2014.
General government debt is set to decrease to
40.1% in 2013 and 39.4% 2014.

Financial sector contributing less to growth
Subdued growth prospects ahead

In the last quarter of 2012, real GDP growth
rebounded to 1.6% q-o-q, after a fall of 0.5% in the
third quarter. Several factors explain this
expansion: the end of a car purchase incentive
scheme gave private consumption a temporary
boost, investment was spurred by a large satellite
operator purchase, and favourable weather
conditions propped up construction activity.
However, excluding for these non-recurrent
developments, economic activity in the last part of
the year would have continued to be lacklustre. In
2012 as a whole, output grew by 0.3% after 1.7%
in 2011.
In 2012 industrial production fell by 5% and
remained at a level around 10% lower than its
long-term average. The contraction was
particularly strong in the steel sector, where plants
were closed down and both employment and gross
value added shrank. The output of the construction
sector declined by 5% in 2012 continuing a
negative trend initiated already in the middle of
2011. The financial services industry remained
resilient although decelerating. A more detailed
analysis of the sector shows that the impact of the
overall economic slowdown has been concentrated
in the intermediation activity, while activity of the
investment funds and private banks remained
dynamic. Finally, the contribution of net exports
remained negative on the back of weak economic
activity in the euro area.

the current slack in economic activity. The overall
confidence indicators in both the industrial and the
construction sector, after a tentative rebound in the
second half of 2012, have returned to a downward
trend recently. Private consumption is projected to
be subdued as households' disposable income is
expected to be negatively affected by the
consolidation measures included in the budget and
the ongoing deterioration in the labour market is
likely to dampen consumer spending. The relief
provided by lower prices is unlikely to prevent a
drop in real private consumption. A low level of
capacity utilisation associated with weak demand
prospects is assumed to hold back firms’
investment plans.
On the supply side, the contribution from the
financial sector is expected to remain subdued with
the developments in the fund and insurance
industries compensating for the slack in
intermediation activity. Finally, support to growth
from government activity is expected to diminish
in line with the measures taken to rein in public
consumption and investment. A return of activity
is expected to materialise in the second half of the
year, initially triggered by a surge in external
demand.
In 2014, GDP is projected to grow by 1.6%. The
main contribution will come from domestic
demand backed by improving confidence. The
contribution from exports is expected to remain
positive but lessened by more dynamic import
growth, once domestic demand gains momentum.
The main downside risk for this growth outlook
refers to the capacity of the financial services to
remain the growth driver in the Grand Duchy, as
well as that of the country to keep the existing or
even attract new industry.

After peaking at 3.7% in 2011, HICP slowed down
to 2.9% in 2012. The same forces that have driven
it upwards, notably rising prices for oil and other
raw materials, will now drag it down. The index is
expected to abate to 1.9% and 1.7% in 2013 and
2014 respectively. The dampening effect on
inflation exerted by lower oil prices in 2013 and
2014 will only be partially offset in 2013 by the
planned rises in administered prices. Core

components, is expected to average 2.3% in 2013
and slightly increase to 2.4% in 2014.

the budget. In spite of weaker than expected
growth, a surge in VAT revenues from
e-commerce related activities and buoyant fiscal
revenues from the corporate sector compensated
for a shortfall in social contribution revenues. At
the same time, government consumption
expenditure has continued to follow a dynamic
rising trend.

A less dynamic labour market

Job creation still remained robust in 2012 at a rate
of 2.3%. However, this employment increase
masks a drop in the hours worked, on the back of
an increased number of part-time jobs and less
over-time hours. Job creation is expected to
decelerate to around 1.6% in 2013 and 1.3% in
2014 as labour hoarding will finally be limited,
moving the unemployment rate higher to 5.5% and
5.8% in 2013 and 2014 respectively, as the active
population continues to record strong increases.
The agreement with the social partners to limit the
automatic indexation to 2.5% until 2014 will put a
lid on wage growth over the forecast horizon and
help moderate the increase in unit labour costs.

In 2013 the government deficit is projected to
decline to 0.2% of GDP. The implementation of
the consolidation package adopted by the
government with the 2013 budget is expected to
partially correct the autonomous increase in
expenditure and boost revenues. In 2014, under the
usual no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is
expected to increase to 0.4% of GDP. The
acceleration in revenues supported by higher
growth will not fully offset the rising trend in
government expenditure. The structural balance,
estimated at 0.1% of GDP in 2012, is projected to
improve to around ¾% of GDP in 2013, and
deteriorate in 2014 to about ¼%, at unchanged
policy. Public debt is estimated at 25.2% in 2014.

Public finances remain robust

The general government deficit deteriorated from
0.2% of GDP in 2011 to 0.8% in 2012, almost in
line with the original target of 0.7% of GDP set in

16. HUNGARY
Improving external balances amidst a lacklustre economic
performance
A weak recovery after recession

In 2012, the Hungarian economy entered a
recession with GDP contracting by 1.7%.
Domestic demand fell by 3.7%. Investment
contracted for the fourth consecutive year, against
the background of tight lending conditions,
increased economic uncertainty and the
deleveraging in the private sector. Falling
disposable income and high unemployment
contributed to a renewed decline in consumption.
An unusually weak performance in the agricultural
sector contributed to the downturn. The growth
rate of exports declined sharply on account of a
deteriorating external environment.
For 2013 a mild recovery is forecast. Export
markets are set to grow and a stabilisation of
domestic demand is expected on account of an
increase in real disposable income, although the
high unemployment rate and the ongoing
deleveraging are likely to limit household
spending. Private investment growth is projected
to remain negative in view of the continued fall in
lending and high surtaxes on some capital
intensive sectors, while government investment
would be boosted by a higher inflow of EU funds.
In 2014 growth is expected to reach 1.4% due to a
positive contribution from both net exports and
domestic demand. Household consumption is set
to increase on account of a further increase in real
disposable income and looser lending conditions.
Investment growth is projected to turn positive on
account of government-sponsored lending and the
central bank's new Funding for Growth scheme.
Looser-than-expected financial conditions or a
possible stronger-than-expected rebound of
agricultural production might improve the GDP
outlook. By contrast, persistently weak economic
confidence might imply even lower growth.
Employment adjusts sluggishly

Despite the recession, employment increased by
more than 1.7%(21) in 2012. However, the
unemployment rate stood around 11% due to a
continuous increase in the participation rate as a
(21)

72

This is employment based on the national concept as
opposed to the domestic concept (see in Table II. 16. 1.).

result of several government measures (e.g.
extension of the retirement age). Employment
gains partly reflected an extension of the Public
Work Scheme but also higher employment in
small enterprises. However, employment of larger
companies has been declining since early 2012 as
increasing unit labour costs and weak demand
have been forcing companies to adjust through
layoffs to counterbalance the deterioration in
profitability. Consequently, a decline in private
sector employment is expected in early 2013, but
overall employment is forecast to remain broadly
stable. From 2014, employment is projected to
start increasing again. However, as the
participation rate is projected to grow further, a
slight increase in unemployment is expected.
Sharp disinflation

A stronger-than-expected drop in inflation
occurred in the first quarter of 2013. In addition to
the lower overall effect of indirect tax hikes
compared to 2012, this drop is also due to the cut
in regulated energy and other utility prices
introduced as of January 2013. Core inflation was
lower than projected in the 2013 winter forecast.
Underlying inflation is expected to remain
contained over the forecast horizon due to a highly
negative output gap.
After a strong structural adjustment in 2012,
fiscal deficit expected to rise again

In 2012, the general government deficit was 1.9%
of GDP according to the 2013 EDP spring
notification, also thanks to temporary surtaxes on
corporates of ¾% of GDP. Close to half of the
fiscal effort of 3¼% of GDP reflects tax increases,
such as the VAT rate increase to 27%. Spending
restraint and the implementation of structural
reforms also resulted in savings, while public
investment from national resources considerably
decreased, notably in the local government sector.
In 2013, the deficit is expected to increase to 3%
of GDP. This would mainly be due to the phasingout of temporary revenues of ¾% of GDP, the
revenue-reducing
stimulus
measures
(i.e.
introduction of a fully flat personal income tax
system and targeted cuts of social security
contributions combined with new small business

Member States, Hungary

taxes in the context of the Job Protection Plan
(JPA)) amounting to ¾% of GDP and the higher
interest expenditure of more than ¼% of GDP.
Some other elements (e.g. extended public work
scheme) are also expected to increase the deficit by
around ¾% of GDP. Finally, net capital
expenditure, notably public investments, are
forecast to increase by ¾% of GDP.

than ½% of GDP, the increasing fiscal impact of
the JPA of ¼% of GDP and the net budgetary
effect of close to ½% of GDP of growing public
investment and consumption. These elements are
forecast to be partly offset by measures as set in
the 2013 Convergence Programme (e.g. nominal
freeze of public wages, moderate increase of the
social transfers), further revenues related to the
implementation of selected reform measures (e.g.
distance-based road toll, enhancement of the tax
administration) as well as the positive impact of
the economic recovery amounting to altogether 1%
of GDP. In contrast to the winter forecast, no
capital transfer to the central bank to offset its loss
is accounted for also in the light of the recently
announced Funding for Growth scheme of the
central bank.

These deficit-increasing developments are foreseen
to be partly offset by new corrective measures,
mainly higher taxes (e.g. financial transaction
duty, higher tax on energy and utility providers),
amounting to 1¾% of GDP. In addition, measures
announced in the context of the 2011 and 2012
Convergence Programmes (e.g. the distance-based
road toll, review of the pension system) and the
partial elimination of the wage compensation
scheme in the private sector are forecast to
improve the deficit by ½% of GDP.

Debt reduction loses its impetus

The structural deficit is forecast to increase again
in 2013 and 2014, by close to ½% and ¾% of GDP
respectively. Accordingly, the general government
gross debt is forecast to decrease only slightly
from 79.2% of GDP in 2012 to 78.9% in 2014.

The 2014 deficit, based on the usual no-policychange assumption, is projected to increase further
to 3.3% of GDP. This reflects the planned increase
of wages in the public education sector of more

17. MALTA
Subdued investment holds back growth
Economic growth moderated further in 2012

Economic growth continued to decelerate in 2012
with real GDP growth slowing down to 0.8%, from
1.7% in 2011. Net exports were the main driver,
benefiting from strong export performance by the
tourist and financial services, as well as declining
imports of machinery and transport equipment.
Domestic demand remained weak as household
consumption growth turned negative again and
gross fixed capital formation contracted further. In
particular, private construction investment
continued declining, falling below its 2004 value
in nominal terms. Thus, it was only the significant
increase in government consumption expenditure
that supported domestic demand.
Household consumption is expected to
become the main driver of growth in 2013-14

As domestic demand picks up, it is expected to
underpin a gradual acceleration in real GDP
growth to 1.4% in 2013 and 1.8% in 2014.
Household consumption is forecast to become the
main contributor to economic growth over the
forecast horizon, on the back of stable labour
market conditions and improving consumer
confidence following the parliamentary elections
in March. Growth in fixed investment is projected
to turn slightly positive in 2013 on the back of EUfunded projects, albeit subject to implementation
risks, and the construction of the electricity
interconnector with Sicily. A mild acceleration in
investment is forecast for 2014 as the approaching
deadline for disbursements under the current
programming period spurs the drawdown of EU
funds. Still, overall fixed capital formation is
expected to remain subdued, at around 15% of
GDP over the forecast horizon, well below its precrisis peak of over 21%, and directed mainly
towards replacing existing capacities rather than
developing new ones. Government consumption is
expected to continue to contribute positively to
economic growth, albeit less so than in the preelection year 2012, reflecting the need for fiscal
consolidation. Despite expanding external demand,
the pick-up in the import-intensive domestic
demand over the forecast horizon will reflect in a
declining contribution of net exports to economic
growth.

74

Employment and wages continue to grow,
while inflation moderates

Job creation is expected to remain strong in
2013-14, with a projected annual rate of increase
of around 2%. Employment growth is expected to
come mainly from the services sector, underpinned
by increasing female labour market participation,
while unemployment is projected to moderate
gradually to 6.1% in 2014.
After increasing sharply in 2012, partly pushed by
indexation to high inflation, wage growth is
projected to moderate, but labour shortages in
some high growth sectors will continue to put
upward pressure on wages. Restrained average
wage growth will result in moderating unit labour
costs increases over the forecast horizon. Still, unit
labour costs are forecast to grow faster than in the
euro area due to stagnating productivity.
After surprising on the upside in 2012, HICP
inflation is expected to decelerate significantly in
2013 in line with the projected trends in
international commodity markets. Price pressures
in all components of HICP inflation are expected
to subside as the economy continues to operate
below its potential. All-items HICP inflation is
projected to remain below 2% also in 2014,
assuming that utility tariffs remain unchanged. The
government's electoral commitment to lower tariffs
significantly in 2014 represents a downside risk to
these projections.
Fiscal stance has lost momentum

The general government deficit increased by 0.5
pp. in 2012, reaching 3.3% of GDP. The increase
was due to accelerating intermediate consumption,
higher social transfers and the rise in compensation
of employees in the public sector. The latter
occurred on account of the renewal of collective
agreements in a number of sectors, including
health and education, while the government was
committed to restraining hiring. In spite of
dynamic public investment and higher subsidies to
investment, including the equity injection into Air
Malta, net capital expenditure as a share of GDP
increased only marginally, as a result of higher
capital transfers and negative capital asset sales.
Total current revenues increased mainly on the
back of dynamic taxes on income and wealth and

Member States, Malta

social contributions, while subdued private
consumption implied a moderate growth in indirect
taxation revenue.

deficit is expected to continue expanding. The
main downside risk to this debt outlook is related
to the financial situation of Enemalta, which could
entail additional subsidies.

The approved 2013 budget appears to be
expansionary. As a consequence, the deficit in
2013 is expected to widen to 3.7% of GDP. Total
current primary expenditure is forecast to increase
marginally by 0.1 pp. of GDP, as the increase in
intermediate consumption is offset by less dynamic
social transfers due to the impact of the 2006
pension reform. On the capital side, net
expenditure, comprising the planned additional
equity injection into Air Malta (0.6% of GDP), is
expected to stabilise. The increase in tax revenue
related to the pick-up in economic activity only
partly compensates for the disappearance of the
one-off revenues registered in 2012. In addition,
income taxes are projected to decelerate on the
back of measures to gradually reduce the overall
income tax burden in 2013-15. As a result, current
revenues are projected to decline marginally. In
2014, the deficit is projected to improve slightly,
reaching 3.6% of GDP mainly due to improved
labour market conditions.

After increasing by ½ pp. of GDP in 2012, the
structural deficit is expected to improve mildly by
¼ pp. of GDP in 2013, on account of one-off
measures. Under the usual no-policy-change
assumption, the structural deficit improves further,
albeit only slightly, in 2014.

18. THE NETHERLANDS
A very fragile and gradual recovery
growth is projected to remain negative in the near
term, and to broadly stabilise in 2014.

Significant contraction in GDP in 2012

After expanding in 2011, economic activity
contracted by 1.0% in 2012. The quarter-onquarter growth was slightly positive in the first half
of the year, but plummeted thereafter. Domestic
demand declined by 1.6% in 2012, to a large
extent due to lacklustre private consumption
reflecting weak disposable income, the impact of
consolidation measures, as well as negative wealth
effects from declining house prices and pension
cuts. Moreover, continued uncertainty about
economic prospects and subdued expectations
weigh on household consumption. Economic
growth was supported only from the external side,
largely on the back of a trade surplus in goods.
Weak domestic demand continues weighing
on economic recovery

Real GDP is forecast to continue to shrink in 2013,
at -0.8%, although growth is expected to return
gradually to slight positive territory from the
second quarter of the year onwards. This is due in
particular to strong exports of goods. Domestic
demand is forecast to remain depressed into 2013,
as budget consolidation and negative wealth
effects, chiefly emanating from the housing
market, continue to pose a drag on the Dutch
economy. In 2014, domestic demand is expected to
begin to pick up gradually, supporting a fragile
recovery, with real GDP increasing by 0.9%.

By contrast, net exports are expected to continue to
provide support to economic growth over the
forecast period, in spite of relatively subdued
external demand from the EU, the main export
market for the Netherlands.
Import growth is set to remain more sluggish, in
line with weak internal demand. The projected
sustained rise in the current-account surplus thus
predominantly reflects depressed internal demand.
In 2014, both exports and imports are forecast to
gain momentum.
Risks to this macroeconomic scenario are
predominantly on the downside. A steeper fall in
house prices would weigh on private consumption
and investment. Also, a faster rise in
unemployment
and
possible
additional
consolidation measures may slow economic
recovery compared to the baseline scenario. On the
other hand, should house prices bottom out, this
would underpin domestic demand.
Inflation set to ease

pps.

07

The fall in gross fixed capital formation is set to be
maintained in 2013, by -3.3%, following the more
marked decline last year (-4.6%), and to only turn
positive in 2014. Business investment is expected
to remain weak during 2013 mainly as a result of
weak business prospects, but in part also in
response to tightened credit conditions by banks.

In 2012, HICP inflation stood at 2.8%, having
been lifted by increases in energy prices and policy
measures, notably the increased VAT rate as of
October 2012. In the short run, the disinflationary
effects of weak domestic demand and decreasing
commodity prices should be partly compensated
by the lagged upward pressures from the increase
in the standard VAT tax rate. Thus, inflation is
likely to stabilise at 2.8% in 2013 before easing
further to 1.5% in 2014.
Unemployment on the rise

With real disposable income staying subdued and
consumer confidence continuing to hover around
historical lows, private consumption expenditure

76

In the beginning of 2013, the upward trend in the
unemployment rate was accentuated, reaching
6.2% in February. A key reason behind this

Member States, The Netherlands

development is a reversal of earlier labour
hoarding, while employment in housing-marketrelated industries is suffering in particular from the
ongoing housing slump. Many companies were
able to retain a major share of their labour force in
the immediate wake of the crisis. However, with
the prolonged weakness in economic activity,
buffers of firms are starting to become depleted as
the private sector faces a continuous financial drag
and an increasing number of bankruptcies. Against
this background, unemployment is set to rise
further to 6.9% in 2013 and 7.2% in 2014.

Under
the
customary
no-policy-change
assumption, government expenditure is forecast to
continue to grow more slowly than current
revenues in 2014. However, in view of the fairly
modest recovery, the general government deficit is
projected to stabilise at 3.6% of GDP. The current
forecast does not incorporate the additional
consolidation package for 2014 proposed by the
government in March but withdrawn for further
consideration in response to the agreement reached
with social partners in April 2013.
In response to the ongoing consolidation, the
structural balance is expected to improve in 2013
by around 0.6 pp. and to slightly worsen in 2014.

Deficit reduction coming to a standstill

In 2012, the general government deficit fell to
4.1% of GDP, from 4.5% of GDP in 2011. The
deficit is expected to improve further to 3.6% of
GDP in 2013, due to sizeable consolidation
measures mainly on the revenue side. The 2013
deficit is also influenced by a number of one-offs
that cancel each other out, such as measures
related to the nationalisation of SNS Reaal and the
sale of mobile telephony licenses.

The gross government debt ratio increased to
71.2% in 2012 and is expected to increase further
to 74.6% in 2013 and 75.8% in 2014. This is
mainly due to the persistent deficits in combination
with weak economic growth, the debt-increasing
impact of financial support operations, and the
recent nationalisation of SNS Reaal.

slightly negative in the last quarter. Business and
consumer confidence deteriorated considerably
until October. While sentiment has gained some
ground since then, there is significant
heterogeneity across sectors and it remained
generally subdued in March 2013.

Indicators of activity point to a lacklustre start of
2013. Capacity utilisation recovered from a slump
in the previous quarter, but failed to display any
marked improvement. Manufacturers' backlogs
decreased further in January 2013 while orders,
including those for exports, were rather
disappointing in the first quarter. Retail sales
remained flat in January-February 2013.
Waiting for a start signal

The weakened growth dynamics in late 2012 and
early 2013 are weighing on the overall GDP
growth prospects for 2013. Nevertheless, the
economy is well prepared for a gradual upturn in
the coming quarters and 2014.
Although seemingly reluctant to invest beyond
ensuring the adequacy of the capital stock, the
corporate sector has accumulated significant
savings over the recent years and should not face
financing difficulties. Favourable financing
conditions should support investment demand in
the coming months.

Employment growth remained robust in 2012.
Although set to ease as increased unit labour costs
limit the scope for employment gains, the change
in employment is projected to remain positive in
2013 and possibly regain some strength in 2014.
Unemployment is expected to be higher in 2013
and 2014, but mostly on account of the increase in
the labour force. The real wage bill growth is
likely to stay positive in 2013 and 2014 against the
background of high wage settlements in 2012 and
declining inflation. This should provide for
gradually
more
sustained
increases
in
consumption.
The exporting sectors are forecast to benefit from
progressively
improving
external
demand
conditions in relevant markets over the forecast
horizon. Exports of services experienced an
increase in market shares in 2012. Industrial
productivity improved further in 2012, while unit
labour costs have increased only moderately,
leaving
cost
competitiveness
seemingly
unimpaired. All in all, the external balance is
projected to stay positive and to provide a positive
contribution to growth in 2013-14.
The balance of risks to the growth outlook seems
neutral to slightly positive. While downside risks
stemming from weaker foreign demand cannot be
discounted, domestic demand may well present a
positive surprise if the confidence of firms and
consumers recovers more swiftly than anticipated.
Headline inflation reached 2.9% in OctoberDecember 2012 due, inter alia, to labour cost
pressures in certain services. Since then, it has
eased to 2.4% in March 2013, mostly on account
of food and fuel prices disinflation. Inflationary
pressures are expected to dissipate further in the
course of 2013-14 with inflation moving below
2%.
Consolidation continues apace

In 2012, the general government deficit remained
stable at 2.5% of GDP. This better-than-expected
outcome is mainly due to robust dynamics of
households' income, which fuelled revenues from
personal income tax and social contributions. Oneoff measures to support troubled banks amounting
to 0.9% of GDP precluded a decline in the deficit.

Member States, Austria

The deficit is expected to decrease in 2013 due to
the consolidation effort envisaged by the "stability
package" adopted last year. On the expenditure
side, the measures entailing significant savings in
2013-14, have been largely implemented.
However, proactive measures, in particular
expenditure on education, will offest these savings
leading to a minor increase in discretionary
spending in 2013. This year fiscal consolidation
will be mainly on the revenue side, where
additional
revenues
are
expected
from
discretionary
measures
already
approved.
Nevertheless, the projected deceleration in GDP
growth and the expected rebound in certain
expenditure categories, whose growth was subdued
last year, will limit the size of the adjustment. The
budgeted support to troubled banks will also have
an adverse impact on public finances in 2013.

After a significant improvement in 2012 which led
to a structural balance of -1½% of GDP, the
structural deficit is projected to rise marginally in
2013 and 2014 due to the combined effect of
one-off measures on the revenue and expenditure
side.
The increase of government debt in 2012 turned
out lower than forecast, and is set to slow down
further in 2013, while a decline in the debt ratio is
projected for 2014.

The acceleration in economic activity in 2014
together with the continued savings in pensions
and healthcare, are projected to result in a further
decline in the deficit. However the risks of a
delayed economic recovery and further
government intervention in the banking sector
could lead to an upward revision of this estimate.

Muted growth prospects amid prevailing uncertainty
Slowdown deepened throughout 2012

In 2012 real GDP grew by a mere 1.9% y-o-y, as
sluggish domestic demand left its mark on
economic activity. In particular, private
consumption growth was lacklustre as employment
creation stalled, real wages declined and consumer
confidence tumbled. Fiscal consolidation curbed
public consumption and investment. A bleak
demand outlook and worsening financial
conditions hampered private investment. External
demand provided some respite for economic
activity as exports expanded more strongly than
imports, which were constrained by weak domestic
demand.

global demand outlook, weak economic sentiment
and deteriorating profitability are expected to
constrain corporates' willingness to invest. Once
economic conditions brighten and financial
conditions continue to improve towards the end of
the forecast horizon, companies are set to renew
their machinery in preparation for an expected
upturn in the cycle. Public investment is projected
to continue falling. Fiscal consolidation is set to
curb public spending further and in addition, fewer
infrastructure projects co-financed from the
previous EU multiannual financial framework are
expected to be completed.

Economic activity stumbles over grim demand
outlook and weak sentiment

Real GDP growth is projected to slow down
further in the first half of 2013 to 0.7% (from 1.9%
in 2012) as the weak economic outlook for main
export markets translates into sluggish private
investment activity and plunging consumer and
business sentiment is constraining domestic
demand. Some rebound, on the back of an
improving global situation and lower cost of credit,
is expected only towards the end of the year. All in
all, real GDP is forecast to increase by 1.1% in
2013. Domestic demand is projected to remain
weak in 2013, with underperforming consumption
and investment, while external demand is likely to
offset to some extent these developments.
Economic activity is set to gradually gain steam in
2014, when the global economic outlook improves
further, and real GDP growth is expected to reach
2.2% over the whole year.
Private consumption is forecast to grow
moderately. Rising unemployment is likely to
weaken disposable income, and waning consumer
confidence is set to increase household savings.
However, these negative effects are projected to be
somewhat offset by higher real wages thanks to
contained inflationary pressures and falling costs
of debt servicing. Only towards the end of the
forecast horizon is private consumption likely to
accelerate thanks to improving labour market
conditions and recovering confidence.
Private gross fixed capital formation is projected to
grow, albeit at a sluggish pace, in 2013 as a dire

Foreign trade is expected to support growth in
2013, while in 2014 the positive net effect on
growth is forecast to shrink, because imports are
set to catch up on the back of higher private
domestic demand. The current-account deficit is
set to decrease from 3.3% in 2012 to 2.4% in 2014.
This growth outlook is subject to broadly balanced
risks. On the upside, a weaker currency would
further boost exports and enhance import
substitution. On the downside, a further
deterioration in consumer and business confidence
might lead to an even more risk-averse behaviour
of consumers and companies, delaying the pick-up
in investment and consumption.
Inflation remains contained over the forecast
horizon

HICP inflation reached 3.7% in 2012, as a result of
depreciation of the zloty, high commodity prices
and increases in administered prices. The inflation
rate is expected to decrease sharply to 1.4% in

demand.

thresholds. On the other hand, the share of pension
contributions retained in the public pillar will start
to fall (i.e. the share of the contributions
transferred to the private pension funds will start
increasing as their previous reduction will be
partially reversed). The main structural measures
decreasing expenditure are the freeze of wages of
central government employees and the start of a
gradual increase in retirement age. Moreover, the
government intends to further lower public
investment.

Fiscal consolidation halts due to the slowdown

The general government deficit is projected to
slightly increase over the forecast horizon, due to
the weak economic outlook for 2013 and a reversal
of some consolidation measures in 2014.

In 2014, the deficit is expected to increase to 4.1%
of GDP under the no-policy-change assumption.
Despite a rebound in economic activity, the
revenues will be negatively affected by the expiry
of the temporary increase in VAT rates, a
reinstatement of VAT reimbursement for company
cars and fuel and a further decrease in pension
contributions retained in the public pillar.

In 2012 the deficit reached 3.9% of GDP due to a
higher-than-expected slump in indirect tax
revenues, higher current expenditure and a fall in
received capital transfers. These factors more than
offset a sharp fall in public investment.
In 2013, the deficit is projected to stay at 3.9%
(subject to the risk of a repeated slump in VAT
revenues). The effect of taken measures is set to be
offset by slow economic growth. On the revenue
side, the main deficit-reducing measures include
the full-year effect of the ones that came into force
during 2012 (an increase in the disability
contribution rate and the new mining tax) and a
continued freeze in Personal Income Tax (PIT)

The structural deficit is set to fall from 3.8% in
2012 to 2.9% in 2014. General government debtto-GDP ratio is forecast to increase from 55.6% in
2012 to 58.9% in 2014. The projected debt figures
are, however, subject to considerable uncertainty
due to high exchange-rate volatility affecting the
debt valuation.

Adjusting to economic and legal uncertainties
The following text and projections reflect the

EU/IMF-supported programme and Commission
estimates. In view of important policy decisions to
be taken after publication, the projections will be
reassessed at the next review of the Economic
Adjustment Programme.
Stronger than expected contraction due to
deteriorating outlook for export markets

After a 3.2% contraction last year, real GDP is
forecast to fall by 2.3% this year. The large slump
in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2012 appears to
have been partly due to one-off factors likely to
have been reversed in the first quarter of 2013.
Nevertheless, a downward revision of annual
growth for 2013 seems warranted as a result of a
further deterioration of the growth outlook for
Portugal's export markets and worsening labour
market prospects.

Stabilisation expected for the second half of
2013

In spite of headwinds coming both from domestic
and external demand this year, economic activity is
expected to gradually pick up towards the end of
the year. Equipment investment and industrial
production showed signs of bottoming out over the
past months and are expected to rebound in the
second half of this year. Confidence indicators,
albeit at still relatively low levels in all sectors,
have maintained an upward trend over the past five
months. Export growth should be supported by the
redirection of trade towards extra-EU markets.
The recovery should gather pace in 2014 with real
GDP forecast to grow by 0.6%, driven by net
exports and investment as well as a turnaround in
private consumption. The unemployment rate is
forecast to reach 18½% in 2014 as a consequence
of the weaker growth outlook and expected further
cuts in public sector employment.
The rebalancing towards a more export-oriented
growth pattern continues at a good pace. The
balance of trade in goods and services is set to
reach positive territory in 2013 and to improve
further in 2014. In 2013, the current account is

Subdued domestic demand and the weak labour
market are expected to continue exerting
downward pressure on wages and prices over the
forecast period, which should support the ongoing
rebalancing of the economy towards the tradable
sector. HICP inflation has dropped to 0.4% in the
first quarter of this year and is expected to average
0.7% in 2013 and accelerate to 1.0% in 2014.
Risks to the forecast are tilted to the downside. The
macroeconomic outlook is subject to the
implementation of the fiscal measures, worth 0.8%
of GDP, to compensate for the budgetary impact of
the Constitutional Court ruling, the details of
which are not yet specified. Beyond this factor, the
projected recovery is contingent on positive trade
and financial market developments, which remain
fragile. Continued tensions in the euro area have
the potential to spill over to Portugal through the
trade, financial markets or confidence channel. On
the positive side, Portugal has gradually regained
access to the sovereign-bond market at more
favourable interest rates. If this trend continues,
financing conditions could also improve for the
private sector.

Expenditure Review. On 5 April, the
Constitutional Court ruled against some of the
budget measures worth about 0.8% of GDP. On 17
April, the Portuguese Council of Ministers decided
to fill this gap with various measures, including the
compression of line ministries' outlays and
possibly further extension as well as frontloading
of measures from the public expenditure review.
The fiscal projections for 2014 are underpinned by
permanent consolidation measures, worth at least
1¾% of GDP, which hinge on the spending
reductions from the Public Expenditure Review.

The general government deficit in 2012 reached
6.4% of GDP, above the 5% projected in the 2013
winter forecast, as some of the then identified risks
have effectively materialised, notably the statistical
treatment of the sale of the airport concession
ANA as non-deficit reducing item. Other large
one-off operations also added to the deficit, such
as the capital injection into the state-owned bank
CGD and the re-routing of the conversion of
shareholder loans to a state-owned enterprise
(Sagestamo). Fiscal consolidation was, nonetheless
remarkable with a fiscal effort of about 2¼% of
GDP, reaching a structural balance of some 4¼%
of GDP. Interest costs also peaked in 2012 at
around 4.4% of GDP, thus the structural primary
balance is now moving into positive territory.

Downside risks to the fiscal outlook could arise
from an unexpected worsening of the
macroeconomic environment. In addition, there is
uncertainty regarding the design of measures of the
public expenditure review related to their
compliance with the latest Constitutional Court
ruling.

The fiscal balance is expected to be -5.5% of GDP
in 2013 and -4% in 2014. Fiscal consolidation in
2013 is set to continue on the back of the measures
adopted in the budget, which are strongly tilted to
the revenue side through increases in personal
income and property taxation, and the frontloading
of some measures envisaged in the Public

The debt-to-GDP ratio shifted upwards to 123½%
in 2012, partly due to the statistical treatment of
the transfers of privatisation receipts from
Parpública to the State. The public debt-to-GDP

Gradual recovery ahead
Gradual recovery mostly driven by domestic
demand

The economy expanded by a mere 0.7% in 2012,
having been dragged down by a severe summer
drought affecting agricultural output and by a
weak external environment. In 2012, the currentaccount deficit declined by 0.5 pp. to 4.0% of GDP
due to smaller trade and income deficits.

external sector is projected to continue to
contribute negatively to growth. The negative
contribution from the external sector will result
from the weak recovery in the country's main
trading partners and stronger imports. After a
substantial improvement in 2012, the currentaccount deficit is forecast to remain below 4% of
GDP in 2013 and 2014.
Risks to growth appear balanced. Upside risks
include more favourable agricultural developments
and higher-than-expected absorption of EU funds.
Downside risks stem from a stronger-thanexpected deceleration of domestic credit.

Current account balance

Economic activity is expected to recover modestly
and reach 1.6% GDP growth in 2013. The driver
of growth continues to be domestic demand with
investment as a key contributor. The country's
public investments should be supported by an
improved absorption of EU funds. Government
consumption is forecast to have a modest, but still
positive, contribution to growth. Private
consumption is also expected to make a positive
contribution although it is likely to be constrained
by households' continuing needs for repairing their
balance sheets.
Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 2.2%
in 2014 as structural reforms implemented in
product and labour markets start paying off.
Domestic demand is likely to be the main driver,
powered by both investment and private
consumption, while net exports are still expected
to contribute negatively to GDP growth.
The current tight financing conditions coupled
with the ongoing deleveraging by banks are
expected to hinder the flow of credit to the
economy and to hold back export growth. The

Headline inflation averaged 3.4% in 2012. After
slowing down in the last quarter of 2012, HICP
peaked in January 2013 at 5.1% (y-o-y). In March
2013, monthly inflation came to a standstill mainly
due to lower-than-expected food and energy price
increases. Food price inflation is expected to
decelerate significantly in the course of the year,
especially in the second half of 2013, due to
positive base effects. Energy prices are set to stay
high due to the ongoing liberalisation of
administered electricity and gas prices.
On the back of the economic recovery and
continuous energy price liberalisation, average
inflation is expected to reach 4.3% in 2013 while
for 2014 an average inflation of 3.1% is forecast.
Labour market to continue to improve slightly
in 2013

In 2012, employment increased by more than
expected, growing by 1.9% in comparison to 2011.
However, the improvement in regular employment
was counterbalanced by a negative job trend
among the self-employed. Employment is expected
to recover somewhat further over the forecast
horizon. Unemployment came down from 7.4% of
the labour force (age group 15-74) in 2011 to 7%
in 2012 and it is expected to stay below 7% in
2013 and 2014. Youth unemployment, currently at
around 23%, is expected to fall somewhat but to
remain high.

deregulation of gas prices. The minimum wage
was increased from RON 700 by RON 50 as of
1 February and is set to be increased by another
RON 50 on 1 July; the increase in the minimum
wage does not affect personnel expenditure in the
public sector as the minimum wage is already
RON 811.

Budget deficit to stay below 3% over the
forecast horizon, but risks remain

Romania reduced its government deficit to 2.9% of
GDP in 2012. The budgetary consequences from
the financial corrections on EU funds that became
necessary at end-2012 were compensated by
windfall
revenue
from
the
sale
of
telecommunication licenses.

Benefiting from the expected acceleration in
economic activity and based on the customary nopolicy-change assumption, the deficit is expected
to decrease further to 2.4% of GDP in 2014. The
structural deficit is forecast to improve over the
forecast horizon from some-2¾% in 2012 to about
-1½% in 2014. Public debt is expected to stabilise
below 39% of GDP in 2013-14.

The budget deficit for 2013 is forecast at 2.6% of
GDP. Following elections in late 2012, the
government passed the budget in February 2013
targeting a deficit of 2.4% of GDP. However, the
gains from prioritisation of investment projects and
the impact of the revenue measures' package are
currently forecast to be more limited than
previously assumed. The budget allows for a 4%
increase in pensions, and an allocation to
implement the EU Late Payments Directive in the
health sector. Revenue-enhancing measures
include reductions in tax-deductible items,
improving the taxation of agriculture, and making
the turnover tax of 3% on small enterprises
mandatory. Property tax and excise rates increased
to keep up with inflation, while a tax is set to be
introduced on windfall gains following the

The main risks to the budget over the forecast
horizon relate to: (i) further possible financial
corrections linked to the absorption of EU funds or
the financing from the national budget of priority
projects; (ii) renewed accumulation of arrears in
the second half of 2013 and possibly continuing in
2014, especially at local government level; and
(iii) limited progress with restructuring stateowned enterprises that could result into renewed
pressure on the budget.

Slow deleveraging and delay in reforms prolong recession
Existing imbalances prolong recession

Real GDP contracted by 2.3% in 2012 and is
expected to drop further by 2% this year and to
stabilise in 2014 on the back of steadily declining
domestic demand. The protracted weakness of the
economy has subdued inflation, labour costs, credit
growth and it has resulted in a current-account
surplus. Existing imbalances continue to weigh on
growth and fiscal adjustment.

imports are projected to fall again in 2013, due to
declining domestic demand, but at a lower rate and
to slowly recover in 2014, reflecting mainly the
anticipated one-off investment in the coal-power
plant.
Further downside risks to growth

Risks to growth are tilted to the downside. Further
delays in resolving the banking crisis and
restructuring the highly indebted corporate sector
have already resulted in a downward revision of
growth forecasts. Any additional postponement of
required bold structural reforms would lead to a
further deterioration of growth prospects.

GDP (y-o-y%)

Private consumption is set to fall by 3¾% in 2013
and 2% in 2014, despite a slightly improved
consumer confidence in early-2013. Rising
unemployment is one of the main contributors to
the continuous negative trend in consumption. In
addition, an increasing share of new nonpermanent jobs is reducing stability of income.
Gross fixed capital formation is also expected to
remain subdued. Though still negative, the forecast
for 2013 has been revised somewhat upwards to a
drop of 5%, due to anticipated investment in
machinery in 2013-14 for a recently constructed
coal-power plant and increased absorption of EU
funds in 2013. Nevertheless, fixed investment
continues to decline, mirroring high deleveraging
needs of the corporate sector and pressure on
banks' balance sheets.
The release of positive trade data in March points
at a gradual recovery of export in the first quarter
of 2013 and a shift towards faster growing markets
outside Europe. This is expected to drive exports
up by 1¼% in 2013 and 3¼% in 2014. Meanwhile,

86

The ongoing restructuring of the corporate sector
as well as necessary public and private
deleveraging indicate a further reduction in
employment of 1½% in 2013 and ½% in 2014. The
unemployment rate is set to increase to 10% in
2013 and 10¼% in 2014. Real wages have dropped
slightly in 2012 as a result of weak growth
outlook, budgeted cuts in public sector wages and
adverse dynamics in the labour market.
Core inflation is expected to remain subdued at a
level below 2%, although some upside risks on
prices of public utility services exist after the
government has lifted some price controls. If this
effect proves to be significant, it may translate into
higher inflation and further pressure on real
disposable income.
Dynamic interests and pension expenditure as
well as falling revenue hamper consolidation

The general government deficit declined
significantly from 6.4% of GDP in 2011 to 4.0%
of GDP in 2012. The government implemented a
major current expenditure restraint through cuts in
public sector wages and social transfers. However,
most consolidation measures are valid only
temporarily. In addition, public investment was
reduced again, resulting in a drop of 35% since
2009. Finally, capital injections, including oneoffs, to public corporations were lower than in
2011. On the revenue side, the government cut the

corporate income tax rate and introduced more

measures. For the same reasons it is projected to
slightly improve also in 2013. However, the
structural balance is forecast to deteriorate in 2014
mainly due to built-in expenditure increases. The
debt ratio is projected to breach 60% of GDP in
2013 and increase above 66% of GDP in 2014
mainly due to primary deficits and stock-flow
adjustments.

The 2013 deficit is projected at 5.3% of GDP
(without one-off conversions of CoCo bonds into
equity of the two largest banks it would have been
forecast at 4.1% of GDP). The forecast
incorporates the full-year impact of the mid-2012
savings package and the 2013 budget. The
worsening labour market is forecast to result in
falling social contributions. By contrast, social
transfers are projected to increase again because of
the still high number of new pensioners at the end
of 2012 and in early 2013.

Excluding additional measures to strengthen
banks, risks to fiscal projections seem balanced.
Upside risks result from new savings measures in
the announced 2013 supplementary budget, while
downside risks stem from a weak budget
implementation and the court judgement, still
challenged by the government, stipulating the
payment of the salary increase to public employees
postponed in 2010. However, significant further
fiscal resources are required to strengthen banks.
To this end, the Banking Stability Act makes
available up to EUR 4 bn (11% of GDP) of state
guarantees for asset transfer to a Bank Asset
Management Company and up to EUR 1 bn (3%
of GDP) of cash for recapitalisations. These
amounts are not included in the deficit and debt
projections as actual implementation and amounts
necessary remain uncertain.

The 2014 deficit is projected at 4.9% of GDP
under the no-policy-change assumption. The 2014
budget does not incorporate new discretionary
measures, except for a reduction in the corporate
income tax rate to 16% and a broad stabilisation of
the public sector wage bill. Tax revenues and
social contributions are estimated to slightly
decrease. On the expenditure side, social transfers,
particularly pensions, and interest payments are set
to remain high due to elevated debt levels.
The structural balance improved significantly in
2012 alongside implemented consolidation

Temporary lull in growth
Deceleration in 2013, followed by a pick-up in
2014

Despite a marked deceleration in industrial
production in the last quarter of 2012, real GDP
grew by 2%, one of the highest growth rates in the
EU. The positive growth performance in 2012 was
driven by a record increase in the production and
export of cars, due to the opening of new plants,
while the rest of the economy stagnated. However,
economic growth remained well below the level
historically associated with improvements in the
labour market and the unemployment rate
increased to 14%.
With domestic demand constrained by persistent
weaknesses in the labour market and external
demand from Slovakia's trading partners set to
decelerate markedly, the growth rate of real GDP
is forecast to temporarily slow to 1% in 2013. The
economy is expected to benefit from a recovery in
the second half of 2013, primarily supported by a
pick-up in private investment and external
demand, the first signs of which appear in the most

investment in the automotive sector is expected to
reach the production phase. At the current juncture
the reliance of exports on a few cyclicallysensitive sectors represents a downside risk to the
forecast.
Domestic demand supported mainly

by

After the negative contribution to real GDP growth
in 2012, domestic demand is expected to remain
subdued in 2013 and to contribute significantly to
growth only in 2014.
With unemployment on the rise and a sizeable
consolidation effort taking place in 2013, private
consumption growth is expected to resume only in
2014. On the other hand, having dropped markedly
in 2012, investment is forecast to gradually return
to its long-term level, starting with a modest
increase already in 2013. Low projected interest
rates along with an improvement in the economic
outlook are expected to support a more decisive
increase in private investment in 2014. This
forecast additionally expects a significant
acceleration in the drawdown of EU funds, as the
financial programming period draws to an end.
Nevertheless, in the light of past experience this
remains subject to implementation risks.
Labour market conditions remain challenging over
the forecast horizon. Modest employment growth
is expected to resume only in 2014, whilst the
unemployment rate is projected to stay above 14%
over the forecast horizon.

Wage pressures are to remain contained in the next
two years, consistent with developments in the
labour market. HICP inflation is accordingly set to
stabilise at close to 2% mirroring decelerating
growth in energy and commodity prices and
subdued domestic demand pressures.

Exports remain the main driver of growth

Net exports are expected to continue to support
growth over the forecast horizon, although only
moderately in 2013, as the one-off impact of the

Consolidation on track

In 2012, the general government deficit reached
4.3% of GDP, some 0.3 pp. lower than targeted
and compared to 5.1% of GDP in 2011. The final
outcome was positively influenced by the revenue
measures adopted by the government in the course

Member States, Slovakia

of the year as well as a lower-than-budgeted
drawdown of EU funds, non-budgeted revenue and
lower investment of local governments, and
savings on social insurance expenditure. This more
than offset substantial revenue shortfalls
(especially VAT) and a higher-than-budgeted
assumption of past hospital debts.

in the forecast that these savings will not be fully
realised.
In March 2013, the government presented
additional measures to counter a stronger-thanexpected deterioration in projected revenue for
2013. This shortfall is to be addressed mainly by
eliminating budgeted but not yet allocated
expenditure, and through lower spending on health
care and extra dividend income. The authorities
also plan an auction of telecom licences and to sell
the oil reserves.

The multi-annual 2013-15 budget includes several
measures that contribute to the continued deficit
reduction in 2013. The consolidation package
mainly consists of revenue measures. These
include a hike in the corporate income tax rate
from 19% to 23%, a new 25% tax bracket in the
personal income tax system, adjustments in the
taxation of self-employed and atypical work
contracts, a broadening of the bases for social
contributions, and increases in administration fees.
Expenditure savings are envisaged in the wage bill
of public employees, goods and services and
general government investment. Substantial
reductions in expenditure would come from local
governments and budgetary entities not under the
direct control of the central government. In the
absence of implementation measures, it is assumed

The headline deficit in 2013 is projected to reach
3% of GDP with the structural balance estimated at
3% of GDP. In view of the expiration of some oneoff and temporary revenue measures, under the no
policy change assumption, the deficit is projected
to increase slightly above 3% in 2014 despite a
pick-up in economic activity. The structural
balance would improve by some ½ pp. The debtto-GDP ratio is projected to increase over the
forecast horizon and to reach 56.7% of GDP in
2014.

25. FINLAND
Modest growth in the absence of export boost
Upturn expected in 2014

The Finnish economy contracted by 0.2% in 2012,
with private and government consumption as the
only components supporting growth. Inventories
were run down as production did not meet
demand. The positive net exports contribution
stems from a decline in imports which was faster
than the contraction in exports. Gross fixed capital
formation receded due to declines in both
construction and investment in equipment.
In 2013 the economy is expected to return to
growth, followed by a further gradual recovery in
2014. Private consumption is projected to drop in
the first quarter of 2013 due to the planned VAT
increase, but is set to return to slow growth
afterwards on the back of stable disposable income
despite slightly rising unemployment. Exports are
forecast to rebound in the first quarter of 2013 and
to recede to low growth afterwards. They are held
back by the ongoing restructuring in exportoriented industries but encouraged by the upturn in
imports in Finland's main EU trading partners. The
decline in gross fixed capital formation in 2012
carries over to 2013, with growth returning in
2014.
Risks to the outlook are balanced. In the short run
the ongoing restructuring in certain industries,
notably in the electronics sector, could depress
employment and the export performance more than
projected. Going forward, a stronger-thananticipated recovery of the European and world
economy might push exports upwards.
Investment remains weak

Private consumption suffers from setbacks from
the 1 pp. VAT increase at the beginning of 2013
and increases in income taxation in both 2013 and
2014. In addition, there is a purely statistical effect
due to the replacement of the television service fee
by a tax in 2013. While the fee was part of private
consumption, the expenditure now covered by the
tax is part of public consumption.
Moreover, the slow growth in real disposable
income is set to continue in 2013, while its
evolution in 2014 will depend on the outcome of

90

the ongoing wage negotiations. Household savings
are expected to increase to 8.4% of disposable
income in 2014.
Growth in gross fixed capital formation is
projected to remain close to zero in all four
quarters of 2013. Investment in equipment is
forecast to recede, while construction is likely to
grow slowly. However, the heavy decline in gross
fixed capital formation of 2012 carries over to
2013, leading to a decline of 1.5% for 2013. Only
in 2014 is investment expected to pick up again, on
the back of a recovery of the world economy and
stable financing conditions.
Trade balance turns negative again

After the decline in 2012, growth in both exports
and imports is expected to pick up in 2013 and to
further accelerate in 2014. Volume growth rates
for both components are similar, while import
prices are expected to increase faster than export
prices. As a result, the trade balance of goods is
forecast to turn negative in 2013 and to decrease
further in 2014. The negative trade balance of
services and net current transfers are projected to
drag the current-account balance downwards to a
deficit of 1.8% of GDP in 2014.
Labour market set to stay resilient

The labour market remained strong in 2012,
although the sluggish growth caused a slight
increase in unemployment in the second half of the
year. The use of temporary layoff support facilities
has remained limited by employers and permanent
payroll cuts are more common.
The labour market is expected to continue on its
strong path. Although employment declines
slightly in 2013, the effect on the unemployment
rate is partly offset by the reduction of the labour
force due to retirements. Unemployment is
projected to be around 8% over the forecast period.
The current collective wage agreement lasts until
the end of 2013. While unit-labour-cost growth
reached 3.6% in 2012, it is expected to be more
moderate in 2013 and 2014 thanks to the
improvement in productivity and higher growth.

Member States, Finland

to -1.8% of GDP in 2013. Thanks to the
adjustment measures taken by the government, the
deficit is set to decrease over the forecast period,
but is still expected at 1.5% of GDP in 2014.

Inflation stabilising in 2013-14

Despite the VAT increase of 1 pp. in 2013,
inflation is set to recede to 2.4% in 2013 and 2.2%
in 2014. The wage increase is more moderate in
2013 compared to 2012 and therefore has a smaller
impact on inflation.

General government gross debt is projected to
grow further due to the persistent deficit.
Government debt is expected to reach 57.7% of
GDP by 2014, close to the 60% ceiling. The
structural budget balance is forecast to improve
slightly compared to 2012 to a deficit of around
½% in 2013 and 2014.

Government balances remain in deficit

For 2013, significant adjustment measures are
being taken to strengthen central government
finances. Exceptionally-low interest rates will
continue to have a positive impact on public
finances. In 2014, the corporate income tax rate is
planned to be lowered, while taxes on dividends
will be increased. It has been decided to raise taxes
on alcohol, sweets, tobacco and energy. Central
government expenditure is not expected to grow in
real terms in 2013 and 2014 thanks to the system
of expenditure ceilings.

26. SWEDEN
Fragile recovery backed by robust household consumption
Signs of recovery after a weak end of 2012

Following solid growth in the first three quarters of
2012 (0.5% q-o-q on average), the Swedish
economy ended the year in stagnation in the fourth
quarter. Over the whole 2012, real GDP grew by a
mere 0.8%. The outcome for the fourth quarter
was, nevertheless, better than expected. Also, the
composition of GDP growth in the fourth quarter
gave rise to more optimism: household
consumption accelerated and investment growth
returned to positive territory, whereas exports and
inventories decreased as expected.
Latest survey indicators also send positive signals
for the near future. Economic sentiment has been
recovering since November, although it still
remains below its long-term average. Stock prices
have reached the highest level since end 2007 in
March 2013. House prices have been unchanged
since June 2012, contributing to the stable outlook.
New orders, both from the domestic and the export
market, have shown an upturn in recent months
and eventually started increasing also in year-onyear terms in February. However, industrial
production still remained weak, below the 2012
level.
Moderate growth

GDP growth is expected to pick up gradually over
the forecast horizon, recording 1.5% in 2013 and
2.5% in 2014. Unlike previous recoveries, which
were typically export-driven, the main push for
growth is expected to come from domestic
demand.
Exports recorded mediocre growth in 2012 and
recent data indicate further deceleration at the
beginning of 2013, especially in merchandise
exports. This development reflects continued
subdued demand from the EU countries as well as
the stronger krona, which appreciated by some 5%
in nominal effective terms from the early- 2012
and to early-2013. Yet, the export orders, as well
as the recovery in the US and emerging economies
suggest that exports should pick up again in the
course of the year. Imports are likely to follow
exports very closely, leaving the current-account
surplus unchanged at around 7% of GDP.

92

Household consumption is likely to be the most
important source of growth in 2013. Households
are becoming more optimistic, encouraged by
stable house prices, decreasing interest rates and
the rise in the stock market. Household
consumption grew dynamically already in late2012 and monthly data for retail sales suggest
further strengthening in early-2013. Real
disposable incomes are growing at a solid pace,
supported by sound wage growth (3% in 2012),
low inflation and higher pension payments.
Household savings are currently at a record high
level (with the saving rate at 14.1% in 2012),
reflecting demographic factors and persistent
uncertainties about the euro-area outlook. This
creates potential for higher consumption once
uncertainty subsides and precautionary savings are
reduced. In 2014, the improvement in the labour
market should add another impetus for households
to spend.
Capital formation is set to resume only gradually.
Surveys on investment plans suggest that
businesses, in particular in industry, have become
more cautious and expect to trim capital spending
in 2013. Residential investment is also likely to
remain weak, although the decline should bottom
out in the course of 2013. However, the currently
low investment ratio and favourable financing
conditions (repo rate at 1%) prepare the ground for
a pronounced rebound in capital spending once the
recovery becomes better anchored. Investment is
thus forecast to accelerate from 1.4% to almost 4%
respectively in 2013 and 2014.

may give a pinch to the fragile upturn in
confidence. Internal risks related to high private
debt and a potential fall in house prices have
subsided since last year. The strong exchange rate
continues to be a risk to Swedish external
competitiveness, although exporters have so far
managed to defend their positions through
squeezed profit margins.

given the recent agreement in the manufacturing
industry to increase wages by 2.2-2.3% annually
over the next three years. As demand and
economic activity resume and the effects of the
krona strengthening fade away, inflation is
projected to pick up gradually from 0.9% in 2013
to 1.4% in 2014.
General government balance turning negative

Weak labour market and below-target inflation

Lacklustre growth pushed the general government
balance from a surplus into a deficit of 0.5% in
2012. Expansionary policies focusing on corporate
taxation,
labour
market
measures
and
infrastructure investment and a continued rise in
unemployment are expected to widen the deficit to
1.1% of GDP in 2013, but an improvement to a
deficit of 0.4% is projected for 2014 on account of
accelerating economic activity. The structural
balance is estimated to turn slightly negative in
2013, before improving to ¼% of GDP in 2014.
The decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio will be
reversed temporarily in 2013 due to additional
borrowing of SEK 100 billion (2.8% of GDP) to
strengthen the currency reserves of the Riksbank.
In 2014, debt reduction is expected to resume
again and gross government debt is set to fall back
below 40% of GDP.

With the economy growing below potential, the
labour market is expected to remain weak in 2013.
Most Swedish employers expect no change in
employment in the coming months. As labour
force is set to continue to rise, albeit at a slower
pace, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase
to 8.3% in 2013, before receding back to 8.1% in
2014 on account of higher growth.
Having fluctuated around 0.9% in 2012, HICP
inflation dropped to 0.6% in the first quarter of
2013 on account of lower energy prices. With the
assumed subdued outlook for oil and food prices,
together with fading effects of the krona
appreciation and low demand, inflation is likely to
remain in check in 2013-14. Wage developments
should contribute to the low-inflation environment

27. THE UNITED KINGDOM
Low growth prospects amid continuing consolidation needs
Investors remain wary

Growth improvements remain distant

Despite three quarters of negative and volatile
growth in 2012, the economy grew by 0.3% over
the year. Growth was entirely due to domestic
demand, mainly household consumption. Net
exports, meanwhile, had a strong negative
influence on growth of 0.9 pp. with the
contribution from inventories being marginally
negative.

In spite of falls in the cost of capital, investment
growth has yet to see a major improvement. The
Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), designed by
the Bank of England and HM Treasury to improve
credit conditions, has had the desired effect of
reducing borrowing costs but the knock-on effect
of a rise in net lending has yet to be observed.
Investment growth was subdued but positive in
2012 and this trend is likely to continue in 2013
with annual investment growth forecast at 1.8%. A
larger boost to investment is expected in 2014 as
uncertainty declines further and borrowing costs
remain low. However, there is a risk to the forecast
stemming from potential heightened tensions in the
euro area curtailing the investment appetite.
A continuingly weak external sector

The outlook for 2013 is now somewhat more
pessimistic than earlier in the year as higher-thanexpected inflation weighs down on consumer
spending and an upturn in investment and net
exports appears less likely. GDP growth is forecast
at 0.6% in 2013 and 1.7% in 2014 on a slowly but
gradually improving basis for each of the
expenditure components.

In 2012, net exports made the strongest negative
contribution to growth for a decade. Exports fell
over the year, due to a large decline in services’
exports, whereas imports continued increasing
quite strongly despite the relatively low value of
the pound sterling. Much of the weakness in
exports is related to poor demand from the euro
area which is the UK’s biggest trading partner. As
only a gradual and modest recovery is foreseen for
the euro area and with lessening growth in the
emerging markets, net exports are forecast not to
contribute positively to growth in 2013 with only a
small positive contribution of 0.4% forecast for
2014. Any upset in the euro area risks further
worsening the trade forecast.

Hiccup in consumption growth

Employment continues to be strong

Consumer spending pushed the economy forward
in 2012, by posting positive growth in each quarter
and increasing by 1.2% over the year as a whole.
This had been expected to continue over the
forecast horizon, however, the uptick in inflation is
likely to curtail this growth spurt by pushing
further down on already weak real wage growth.
As a result, households are expected to dip more
into their savings. One major risk to the forecast is
that the higher inflation, projected at 2.8% in 2013,
reduces consumer confidence and households
begin to reverse their current spending trend.

Given the poor growth experienced in the UK,
high rates of unemployment would be expected.
Surprisingly, however, unemployment (22) has
fallen from 8.0% in 2011 to 7.9% in 2012. An
increase in self-employment and part-time work
accounts for some of the decrease but the longer
this phenomenon continues, the less likely that
labour hoarding is also a factor. Surveys suggest
that people are working fewer hours than they
would like. Consequently, when the economy
improves, little change is forecast on the side of
employment as current employees will be able to
work longer hours without the hiring of new staff.

reduction in the corporation tax rate along with an
offsetting rise in the bank levy, a reduction in
employer national insurance contributions and a
new housing finance scheme called “Help to Buy”.

Inflation ticks upward

Borrowing was higher than expected over the year
as tax receipts disappointed. Spending remained
controlled on the Departmental Expenditure Limit
(DEL) side, however, Annually Managed
Expenditure (AME), which allows automatic
stabilisers to operate, increased. On account of the
somewhat offsetting lower growth projection and
the inclusion of the transfer of the Asset Purchase
Facility into government accounts, the deficit is
projected at 6.9% in the financial year 2013-14,
falling to 6.1% in 2014-15. The structural balance
is forecast at -5.3% in 2014-15. The ratio of
government debt to GDP continues to increase as a
result of the higher deficit and lower growth with it
reaching 98.7% in 2014-15.

The expected decline in inflation suffered a blow
as it reversed its earlier trend and increased at the
end of 2012 after falling almost continuously since
September 2011. Consumers had anticipated a
welcome reprieve from negative real wage growth,
but higher-than-expected energy costs and food
prices are likely to result in continued negative real
wage growth for most of 2013. Inflation is forecast
at 2.8% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2014, thus not falling
below the Bank of England’s 2% target rate before
the end of the forecast horizon.
Slow progress on the deficit

The government announced a fiscally-neutral
budget for 2013. More capital investment was
announced, financed through further cuts to
current expenditure which take place beyond the
forecast horizon. Other measures include an
increase in the personal income tax allowance, a

Recovery slipping further away
Stuck in recession

After stagnating in 2011, real GDP fell by 2% in
2012. Since 2008, when the Croatian economy
entered recession, economic activity has contracted
by almost 12%. In 2012, domestic demand
subtracted 2.9 pps. from growth, mirroring a
contraction in all its components. Private
consumption fell by almost 3% and investment
decreased for the fourth year in a row, although the
pace of contraction slowed to -4.6%.
By contrast, net exports contributed positively to
growth in 2012. This, however, was largely due to
the decline in imports of goods (reflecting
depressed internal demand), coupled with growth
in exports of services, in particular tourism.
Overall, the current account moved from a deficit
to near balance.
In line with economic activity, labour market
conditions deteriorated further in 2012.
Unemployment increased substantially by over 2
pps. to reach 15.9%. In line with sluggish
productivity growth, unit labour costs increased.
This together with changes in taxation pushed up
consumer price inflation to 3.4%.

disposable household income. As a result, the rate
of change of private consumption is forecast to
remain negative in 2013. Despite abating
inflationary pressures, private consumption is
expected to weaken further in 2014.

Inflation is expected to be comparatively high in
2013, largely due to discretionary tax measures.
The most important one pertains to the
introduction of a low VAT-rate of 5% in January
2013 and to increases in some administered prices
and excise duties. Inflation is projected to
decelerate in 2014.

Near-term perspectives still clouded

Croatia will become the 28th Member State of the
European Union on 1 July 2013. While EU entry
may be expected to provide support for the
economy, in the very short term the crosscurrents
currently buffeting the economy will remain a
major drag on growth.
Overall, real GDP is expected to decrease by 1% in
2013. Domestic demand should continue to exert a
drag on growth, while net exports are projected to
provide limited support to overall growth. In 2014,
the Croatian economy is unlikely to recover
strongly, as real GDP growth is set to be marginal,
at 0.2%.
Several factors are weighing on domestic demand.
These include the further increase in
unemployment, a high level of household
indebtedness
and
continuing deleveraging
pressures, as well as nominal wage cuts in the
public sector and inflation that is expected to
remain around 3%, thus constraining real

98

Private investment is expected to fall at a lower
pace in 2013, and to return to positive territory in
2014. Supportive new legislation on corporate
income tax and the law on strategic investment,
which came into force recently, as well as EU
accession, could have a beneficial impact on
investment flows. However, ongoing bank
deleveraging and weak domestic demand are
weighing on private investment decisions this year.
As a partial offset, some delayed large public
investment projects could materialise in 2013 and
2014.
However,
these
are
subject
to
implementation risks.
On the external side, the Croatian economy is
likely to be held back by the expected weak
economic outlook in some of its main trading
partners.
Overall employment is expected to continue to
decrease in 2013 and 2014 as a consequence of
weak economic activity. The unemployment rate is

3.8% of GDP. Despite unfavourable economic
conditions, fiscal policy has contained the
budgetary deterioration. Total revenues increased,
mainly as a result of tax measures, including a 2
pps. rise in the standard VAT rate, and
improvements in tax compliance. It is expected
that the deficit will deteriorate to 4.7% of GDP in
2013, mainly reflecting weak activity. This
deterioration is projected to materialise in spite of
the hike in the lower VAT rate as of January 2013,
an expected wage cut in government wages, the
increase in property income, and some other
consolidation measures embodied in the budgetary
revisions announced at the end of March. Under
the customary no-policy-change assumption, the
deficit is expected to widen further in 2014.

Risks are mainly tilted to the downside. Tight
financial conditions may weigh more heavily than
expected on investment. In addition, in the wake of
EU accession, Croatian firms may feel heightened
competitive pressures from firms elsewhere in the
EU. Moreover Croatia will leave the CEFTA zone
on EU accession and this may have an impact on
trade flows with regional trading partners.
Fiscal deficit widening

General government data are under revision in
light of the full change-over to ESA methodology.
Several important adjustments to key fiscal ratios
are to be expected. These revisions complicate
comparisons with earlier reported key figures on
public finance. In 2012, the general government
deficit, as reported by the authorities in the 2013
Economic Programme adopted on 18 April, fell to

Given the deficit and the subdued economic
outlook, the general government debt ratio is
projected to continue the steady increase
experienced since the beginning of the recession,
exceeding 60% of GDP in 2014.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Moving out of the trough
Timid output increases in second half of 2012

The economic situation deteriorated markedly in
2012, as the weaknesses which characterised the
first half of the year continued to weigh heavily on
the economy also in the second half. A fledgling
pick up of output growth in the third and fourth
quarter could not compensate for the steep hits
earlier in the year. As a result, GDP declined by
0.3% in 2012, after an expansion of 2.8% in 2011.
Private
consumption
remained
sluggish,
decreasing by 1.2%. Investment growth proved
resilient at 12.1%, and was boosted by an end-ofyear boom in government capital spending.
Yet, the positive contribution of domestic demand
to output growth was more than compensated by
the drag from external demand. While goods
exports recovered somewhat in the second half, in
the full year they were below their level of 2011.
Given a slight rise in imports, possibly driven by
increased import demand of newly established
foreign investment, trade deficit widened
marginally in 2012. The services balance entered
negative territory in the last months of the year,
leading to a significant reduction in the annual
surplus. Current transfers remained strong, at some
21% of GDP on average, even though declining
towards the end of the year. Hence, the currentaccount deficit rose to 3.9% in 2012, compared to
2.7% a year earlier. The financing of the current
account had relied heavily on strong FDI inflows
in recent years, but these declined by about two
thirds in 2012.
Inflation relented somewhat, to 3.3% from 3.9% in
2011, mainly on account of weaker price increases
in food, and in housing and utilities costs. Relief
also came from the communications sector, where
prices fell by over 4%. Price pressures came
mainly from import prices and regulated prices.
Labour market situation remains weak

There was a slight increase in employment in
2012, and the average unemployment rate for the
year came down to 31%, from 31.4% in 2011. In
light of the economic deterioration, this was
probably in part a statistical effect, on account of
an increase in the labour force due to new
registration of previously informally employed
workers. Yet, there was no improvement in the

102

labour market situation for young people. 54% of
the labour force between 15 and 24 years old were
registered as unemployed.
Public finances take a hit

Public finances deteriorated further in 2012. The
central government deficit amounted to 3.8%, from
2.5% in 2011, exceeding even the government's
revised deficit target of 3.5%. In line with weaker
economic growth, revenues remained significantly
below expectations. Unpaid arrears for due VAT
refunds and contract payments aggravated the
situation further. The share of realised investment
in GDP remained below 4%, while the share of
social transfers and subsidies increased. The level
of general government debt remains moderate, yet
as a share in GDP it had risen by 4 pps. at end2012 on the year. An increasing part of public debt
is financed by foreign sources.

Output is expected to pick up gradually this year
and next, with growth accelerating from 1.5% in
2013 to 2% in 2014. The economic recovery is
likely to be driven by domestic demand, while the
external demand will continue to weigh on GDP
growth, in particular in 2014. Growth impulses
will come mainly from investment. Private
consumption is expected to decline somewhat
further this year, on the back of stagnant real
disposable incomes and a weak labour market
situation, and to pick up only in 2014, in line with
increasing employment.

Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

The drag from net trade will be somewhat less
pronounced this year, as exports may grow more
vigorously than imports, due to a slight pick up in
external demand, and to the completion of some
export-oriented FDI projects. Import demand is set
to increase until 2014, on account of the recovery
of domestic demand as well as of a pick up in
import-intensive FDI. As a result, the trade deficit
is likely to widen somewhat further in 2014.
Current transfers are projected to remain resilient
and to provide a stable source of financing for
domestic demand. Overall, the current-account
deficit will probably widen to about 5.2% in 2014,
mainly on account of the worsening trade balance.

Moderate, but rapidly rising public debt levels

Inflation is expected to decelerate to 3.2% in 2013,
following the expected slowdown in import price
growth, and to slow down further, to 2.8% in 2014.
Employment growth will accelerate marginally in
2013 and pick up further in 2014, in line with the
acceleration in output growth, while the
unemployment rate is projected to decline further
and reach 30% in 2014. Wage growth is likely to
remain subdued, given the need to remain
competitive.

The forecast assumes that the authorities will meet
the 2013 general government deficit target of
3.6%. General government revenues as a share of
GDP are expected to remain stable at around 30%.
The ratio of general government expenditure
would decline to 33.6% in both years, down by 0.3
pp. on the year. Central government debt is
projected to rise by some 4 pps. over the forecast
horizon, mainly on account of a continued negative
primary balance.

From post-crisis recovery towards self-sustained growth?
A decelerating post-crisis recovery...

Economic growth lost momentum during 2012,
leading to a slowdown in GDP growth from 2.9%
in 2011 to 1.6% in 2012. Private consumption and
exports remained rather stable, growing by some
2.7% and 3.9%, respectively. Gross fixed capital
formation decelerated from 14.3% in 2011 to
4.4%. However, imports remained also rather high,
largely
neutralising
the
positive
export
performance. High-frequency indicators present a
mixed picture. Consumer confidence indicators are
still stable on a rather low level, while tourism has
performed exceptionally well during summer. But
payment card turnover data suggest an ongoing
moderation of private consumption.
…needs to be transformed into self-sustained
growth

The economic outlook has remained largely
unchanged since the winter forecast. Private
consumption growth is set to decelerate slightly in
2013, reflecting lower wage growth and still
substantial inflation, eroding real disposable
income and consumer confidence. Furthermore,
temporary income supporting measures, such as
one-off debt relief, extraordinary mortgage interest
allowances and withdrawals of savings from
voluntary pension schemes, are likely to fade out.
On the other hand, households are likely to receive
compensation payments from the banking sector
due the ex-post recalculation of credit
arrangements. In 2014, continued employment
growth and lower inflation should support a
renewed strengthening of private consumption.

forecast

Public consumption is likely to remain limited,
reflecting the need to focus on reducing the debt
ratio. Investment spending has been stronger than
expected in the first half of 2012, although this was
largely due to unusually strong investments in
ships and aircraft. In the second half of 2012, total
investment growth moderated. The forecast
expects that some long-planned investment
projects in the energy-intense and maritime sectors
will gain momentum in late 2013 and early 2014.
Investment growth is thus foreseen to accelerate
markedly in 2014, which however will lead to a
stronger increase in imports. Total exports are
projected to strengthen due to higher fishing
quotas, an improved outlook for the aluminium
sector and a flourishing tourism sector.
Risks and uncertainties remain elevated

Overall, the forecast projects domestic demand to
remain the main driver of growth, while the
contribution of net exports is set to remain limited.
Average growth over the medium term is expected
to remain at around 2.5-3.0%. Downside risks
mainly result from remaining balance-sheet
vulnerabilities in the corporate and in the
household sector, as well as the challenging global
outlook. Moreover, the Icelandic economy is
currently shielded by extensive capital controls and
their removal remains a huge challenge.
Labour market conditions are improving…

Labour market conditions improved during 2012,
with employment growth of nearly 2% and a
marked decline in unemployment, from 7.1% in
2011 to 6.1% in 2012. The expected continuation
of the recovery is likely to translate in further
employment gains and a continued decline in
unemployment towards pre-crisis levels. Longterm unemployment will stay a crucial challenge.

In reaction to rising inflation in 2011 and early
2012, monetary policy has been gradually
tightened and has remained tight since then. In the
meantime, annual inflation has come down from
the peak of 6.5% in April 2012, to slightly below
4% in early 2013. However, inflation pressures
remain elevated due to robust domestic demand,

Trade surpluses are likely to decline

The surplus in trade in goods and services has
recently narrowed, due to stronger merchandise
imports. In view of expected stronger domestic
demand, this trend is projected to continue, albeit
at a slower pace, since exports are set to gain some
strength as well. In particular, tourism seems to
perform better than expected. The lower surpluses
in the trade balance will translate to a similar
deterioration in the current-account balance. A
large part of the deficit accounts for net income
from banks in winding up proceedings. Corrected
for these, the "underlying" current account is likely
to remain close to balance.

General government debt (rhs)
General government deficit

The forecast expects a continuation of Iceland's
fiscal consolidation, leading to a balanced budget
by 2014. After reaching a peak of about 100% of
GDP in 2011, the general government debt-toGDP ratio started to decline in 2012. Thanks to
substantial primary surpluses in 2013 and 2014,
the debt ratio is likely to continue to decline.

Reducing public debt remains a challenge

The general government deficit dropped from
5.6% of GDP in 2011 to 3.4% in 2012. However, it
missed the initial target of 1.4% of GDP by some
2 pps., as some fiscal loosening materialised on the

Back to the starting block
Resetting the basis for growth

In 2012, the economy entered a mild recession
with real GDP contracting by 0.5% compared to
3.2% growth a year earlier. According to
preliminary data, growth was pulled downward by
the poor performance of industry, construction as
well as services (namely financial and transport,
down by 7% and 3.6% y-o-y respectively). On the
expenditure side, net exports had a positive impact
as merchandise imports contracted marginally
while strong revenue from tourism compensated
for the poor performance of goods exports.

The projected moderate recovery of the economy
is expected to bring only marginal relief to labour
market conditions. Further staff cuts at the
aluminium factory (KAP) is likely to reduce in
2013 labour participation as most of the dismissed
workers are expected to quit the labour market and
go into early retirement. The unemployment rate is
expected to remain overall high, at around 19%.
Consumer prices are set to continue the downward
trend initiated at the end of 2012 due to weak
credit and employment dynamics weighting on
private consumption, but also fading base effects
from previous year's hikes of administrative and
electricity prices. Overall, the gradual recovery of
domestic demand in 2013 is now expected to exert
strong inflationary pressures and consumer price
inflation is expected to remain at around 2%.
Moreover, the assumed moderation of global
energy and food prices should support price
stability.

Looking forward to bank lending recovery and
investments

Based on the lower than expected outcome in 2012
projections for GDP growth are slightly revised
downward. Early indications point to a recovery of
growth in 2013 constrained by low base effects in
the first quarter. Conversely, credit activity seems
to have stabilised in March and is expected to
show some positive development in the following
months. Tourism would, like in past years,
continue supporting private domestic demand.
The launch at the end of 2013 of some large
tourism and energy projects will convey a positive
albeit very gradual effect on gross fixed capital
formation in the following years. However, given
the narrow base of the domestic economy, and the
strong import content of investments, gross fixed
capital formation growth would also increase
imports of building material and construction
related services.

106

Estimations on exports performance rely on the
assumption that KAP will not be closed given the
large consensus among political parties in favour
of its survival. In the meantime the production of
aluminium has been cut by half, which eliminates
the need to import electricity. Meanwhile, the
production of steel could increase as the smelter's
new installed capacities reach progressively full
potential. However, only a marginal improvement
in the trade balance can be expected due to the
high import content of investments. By contrast,
the balance of services could further improve in
2014 as new tourism and transport capacities are
being set off.
Although the current-account deficit might
marginally improve, it is set to still remain very
high (close to 17% of GDP). Net exports are
expected to contribute negatively to growth over
the forecast horizon.
Overall, the economy is exposed to significant
financing requirements to cover, not only the
current-account gap, but also the amortisation of
external debt. Additional risks still loom over the
future of the aluminium factory's substantial debt
guaranteed by the state, or the still very high level
of non-performing loans on domestic banks credit
portfolio.

temporary tax on wages. The expenditure-led
fiscal consolidation is expected to continue in
2014, reducing the level of the general government
consolidated spending to around 38% of GDP.
However, despite fiscal adjustment efforts, the
general government balance should still remain
negative, with a deficit of some 2% of GDP by the
end of 2014.

A journey through consolidation

The worsening of the economic performance and
the call of state guarantees led to wide overruns of
fiscal targets. In 2012, the consolidated budget
deficit narrowed to 4% of GDP, down from 5.4% a
year before. Total revenues increased by nominal
1% y-o-y to EUR 1.3 billion. Taxes and income
contributions increased marginally, although VAT
proceeds remained below the plan but also lower
than a year before. Consolidated expenditure
contracted by 2% y-o-y to EUR 1.4 billion or 43%
of GDP. Subsidies and capital expenditure also
recorded annual contraction, while gross wages
remained unchanged and social security transfers
grew someway driven by the increasing number of
military pension beneficiaries.

In 2012, the public debt increased to 51% of GDP
up from 46% a year earlier. Yet, while domestic
debt shrank during 2012, public external
indebtedness climbed to 39% of GDP driven by
loans to finance the central government budget.
Moreover, state guarantees totalled additional
11.5 pps. to debt-to-GDP at the end of 2012.
Public debt is expected to rise over the forecast
horizon. Meanwhile, the reliance of debt reduction
on growth might still result in a higher increase of
the debt ratio to GDP in case of economic
deceleration.

The government started adjusting its short-term
fiscal policy to fiscal pressures early in 2013
through a set of austerity measures, including a
freeze of pension indexation and a crisis-related

Exports to keep the economy afloat
Some signs of bottoming-out

Due to very weak domestic demand, economic
activity deteriorated sharply in 2012. Private
consumption, in particular, fell for a fourth year in
a row. The decline broadened in the last quarter of
the year to include investments and public
consumption. However, following a steep fall in
the first half of the year, net exports turned positive
as imports growth decelerated strongly.
Since the opening of a big car assembly factory in
the summer, exports of goods have accelerated
substantially. They increased by more than 30% in
euro terms in the first two months of 2013 and are
set to be the engine of a mild recovery this year.
Industrial production picked-up as well, albeit
supported by strong base effects due to
unfavourable weather conditions which affected
production negatively in the first two months of
the previous year.

half of 2013, and register some small gains only in
2014. This would barely make a dent on the
extremely high unemployment, which is foreseen
to remain elevated throughout the forecast period.
Even this scenario may turn out to be rather
benign, as the expected rebound in economic
activity is likely to be narrow-based, in mostly
capital-, not labour-intensive sectors, and the
envisaged restructuring of highly inefficient
socially-owned enterprises may lead to additional
lay-offs.

Uneven recovery ahead

The projected recovery is likely to be uneven,
driven by exports and, in particular, by the
automotive industry. A strong contribution is also
expected from agriculture as it rebounds from the
slump in 2012, when it was hit severely by a cold
winter and a drought in the summer. Nevertheless,
growth is likely to be restrained by weak domestic
demand to around 2%, as private consumption is
expected to start growing only in 2014. Fiscal
consolidation is also likely to be a drag on growth,
albeit to a lesser extent than foreseen in the autumn
due to lower deficit adjustments. The forecast
projects a slow acceleration of investments but
downside risks to this profile have increased lately.
Slower than expected recovery in the euro area and
subdued bank lending may postpone or even
reverse the envisaged pick-up in investments.
After double-digit growth in 2013, exports are
expected to remain robust also in 2014, despite a
marked deceleration in their growth. However,
driven by stronger demand, imports would slowly
start catching-up, bringing net exports contribution
to growth close to zero in the outer year.
Unemployment – a key concern

In line with the projected slow recovery,
employment is expected to stabilise in the second

Following last-year's elections and strong fiscal
consolidation measures in the autumn, the dinar
appreciated against the euro and has remained
stable since early 2013. This, along with restrictive
fiscal stance, weak domestic demand and
postponement of adjustment of electricity and
medicines prices, is expected to bring faster than
previously expected disinflation in 2013. However,
inflation remains inherently volatile, influenced by
weak competition in key sectors and irregular
adjustments in administered prices.
Falling but still high external imbalances

Strong exports growth and a cyclical fall in
imports are foreseen to bring a significant
reduction in the trade and current-account deficits
in 2013. Thereafter, external imbalances are
expected to stabilise at a relatively high level.
Foreign indebtedness is likely to increase as nondebt creating financing may not be sufficient to
cover the deficits.

Under the no-policy-change assumption, fiscal
adjustment is expected to be significantly lower in
2014 – less than 0.5% of GDP. In the absence of a
credible medium-term consolidation strategy and
without further measures, the current government
target for a deficit of 1.9% of GDP would be
clearly unattainable and government debt would
continue rising.

Budget uncertainty

The fiscal consolidation measures adopted in
autumn are unlikely to bring the reduction of
budget deficits envisaged by the authorities. In
2013, the deficit may exceed the target by around
1 pp. of GDP and reach 4.5%, while in 2014 the
difference could be twice as high.

Risks to the public finance forecast are mostly on
the downside, as weak domestic demand and
revenue-poor structure of growth, could exert
further pressure on revenue performance. Delays
in structural reforms could also build up pressures
on the expenditure side of the budget, which could
lead to higher expenditure demands, accumulation
of implicit liabilities in the public sector and
increase debt in the medium term.

In the first quarter of 2013, the consolidated deficit
was one third lower than a year ago, due to the
strong expenditure restraint and despite
underperforming revenues. However, the deficit

33. TURKEY
From soft landing to renewed upturn
Soft landing completed

Turkey's policy-induced slowdown from doubledigit growth rates turned out to be somewhat
sharper than anticipated by the authorities. Yearon-year growth rates declined from 12.4% in the
first quarter of 2011 to 1.4% in the fourth quarter
of 2012 when output growth came to a complete
standstill in seasonally adjusted terms. Annual
GDP growth dropped from 8.8% in 2011 to 2.2%
in 2012.
The slowdown was combined with a rebalancing
of growth from domestic demand to export-led
growth. While consumer and capital spending
contracted in 2012, export volumes accelerated to
an annual growth rate of 17.2%. Most of this
impressive rise in total exports was, however,
accounted for by extraordinary exports of nonmonetary gold related to international sanctions on
Iran. Import volumes stagnated as a consequence
of the retrenchment in domestic demand.

rates. This should help to support the ongoing
recovery in capital spending resulting in growth
rates of 7.1% in 2013 and 8.6% in 2014. It will
also bolster consumer spending which should be
underpinned by a continued, albeit slowing,
upward trend in employment and the related
disposable income growth. Private consumption is
projected to increase by 2.2% in 2013 and 3.0% in
2014. Public consumption growth is expected to
grow steadily at 5%. Unlike in 2012, exports are
projected to increase only moderately stronger than
export markets since the unsustainable gold
exports are expected to recede sharply. Imports are
expected to return to substantial growth rates in
parallel with economic activity. As a consequence,
net exports will return to subtracting from GDP
growth and the previous year's rebalancing will be
partly undone. Nevertheless, the revival of
domestic demand will be sufficient to result in
annual GDP growth of 3.2% in 2013 and 4.0% in
2014.
Graph II.33.1: Turkey - GDP, consumption and
investment growth

Signs of an impending upturn
30

Although the momentum of economic activity was
very weak at the turn of the year, monthly data
indicate that output has returned to a growth path
in the first quarter of 2013. The figures for
industrial production, manufacturing PMI and
business sentiment clearly point towards
expansion. Consumer confidence has also
improved on average compared to the previous
quarter, helped by a fall in bank lending rates and
positive
domestic

developments
concerning Kurdish issues. The pace of import
growth suggests a mild increase in domestic
demand. Although gold exports have declined
sharply compared to last year, non-gold exports
have remained relatively strong as Turkish
exporters continue to diversify from Europe to
faster-growth regions, particularly in the Middle
East and Africa.
Growth is set to strengthen moderately

Financial and monetary conditions are supportive
of domestic demand as reflected in the data for
loan growth. The central bank has lowered its
policy rate (the one-week repo rate) from 5.75%
in December 2012 to 5% in mid-April 2013 and
has also continued to lower its overnight interest

Small changes in unemployment and inflation

Employment increased by 3.0% in 2012, i.e. faster
than output. This relation is expected to reverse in
the following two years when employment growth
is projected to lag output growth. Relatively
modest employment growth will not be sufficient
to absorb all of the structural increase in the labour
force stemming from demographic factors and a
rising participation rate. Consequently, the
unemployment rate is expected to rise by 0.5 pp. in
2013 and by a further 0.2 pp. in 2014.

Candidate Countries, Turkey

Headline inflation has increased from 6.2% in
December 2012 to 7.3% in March 2013. Most of
the recent increase in headline inflation was driven
by unprocessed food prices while core inflation
remained relatively stable. In view of of a negative
output gap, persisting until the end of the forecast
horizon, and the assumption of a benign
development in international commodity prices,
the forecasts projects an annual inflation rate of
6.6% in 2013 and 5.6% in 2014, down from 9.0%
last year.

exports. The renewed widening of the currentaccount deficit will be contained by the assumed
decline in oil and other commodity prices. A
current-account deficit of 6.8% and 7.2% of GDP
is projected in 2013 and 2014 respectively.
Fiscal policy to remain relatively stable

With growth slowing faster than expected in 2012,
the fiscal deficit of general government is
estimated to have widened marginally to 2.3% of
GDP with debt declining by about 2 pps. of GDP.
In 2013, the deficit is projected to narrow slightly
since the government is expected to keep fiscal
policy relatively tight out of concern about the
current-account deficit, a wish to maintain a low
level of public debt and a preference for private
sector-led growth. In 2014, the deficit is forecast to
widen to 2.4% of GDP in the context of the
electoral cycle. These projected deficits would still
allow the government debt as a share of GDP to
recede to 36% at the end of the forecast period.

Current-account deficit will widen again

Reflecting the stagnation of imports and the surge
in exports, the current account improved
significantly in 2012. The long-standing deficit
narrowed by about 4 pps. of GDP to around 6%.
However, the data for the first two months of 2013
suggest that the improvement in the current
account has come to an end as imports have started
to pick up in conjuntion with domestic demand
while total exports suffer from sharply lower gold

Fragile recovery clouded by policy uncertainty
Growth stuck in low gear

The US is forecast to continue to grow at a sub-par
pace over the forecast horizon amid fiscal
tightening and policy uncertainties. Growth
forecasts have been kept at 1.9% in 2013 and 2.6%
in 2014 – unchanged from the winter forecast.
According to the final estimate real GDP growth
decelerated to 0.1% q-o-q in the fourth quarter of
2012 reflecting a retrenchment of highly volatile
inventory and defence spending components.
Growth in 2012 as a whole came in at 2.2%, and
despite the fourth quarter pause for the headline
GDP, the broad economy remained on a steady
recovery path throughout 2012. Despite "fiscal
cliff" concerns business investment rebounded by
3.3% in the fourth quarter after growing a mere
0.2% in the third, while residential investment
continued its solid recovery (4.1%). Total private
investment added 0.5 pp. to growth in the fourth
quarter and 1.1 pps. in 2012 as a whole – exactly
half of the registered 2.2% growth.

growth in 2012. The unemployment rate fell to
7.6% in March (the lowest since December 2008)
but most of the improvement came from the
shrinking labour force as the activity rate of
population (labour force / population) declined to a
four-decade low of 63.3%.
Other short-term indicators confirm the slowdown.
Real retail sales contracted by 0.2% m-o-m in
March and consumer confidence indicators have
generally deteriorated in March-April. Likewise,
both ISM and PMI indices (manufacturing and
non-manufacturing) took a deep plunge in
March/April on lower new orders and output,
suggesting weakening activity in the second
quarter.

Economic indicators point to an up-tick in GDP
growth in the first quarter of 2013 from the dismal
fourth quarter. Private consumption held up
relatively well in January and February despite the
fiscal-cliff-deal-implied tax hikes that sharply
eroded disposable incomes. Job creation picked up
in the fourth quarter of 2012 (to 201,000 monthly
average) and remained strong in the first two
months of 2013 (208,000 on average).
Recovery in housing continues…

The housing sector remains buoyant. Home prices
(Case-Shiller 20-city Index) have been rising for
twelve straight months and accelerated to 8.1%
y-o-y in January 2013, the fastest since mid-2006.
Boosted by rising prices, construction activity and
home sales continue to recover, with housing starts
in March at their highest since mid-2008.
… but the short-term momentum weakened
somewhat

However, the economy seems to have lost steam in
March as sequester cuts took effect, clouding the
outlook for the second quarter. Employment grew
by a low 88,000, bringing the first quarter average
down to 168,000, below the mean quarterly job

Monetary policy supports recovery

Monetary policy remains loose, supporting growth,
despite the increasingly acknowledged risks to the
continuation of current bond-buying at the rate of
USD 85 bn per month. However, the belowexpectations March employment report makes it
unlikely that the current rate of bond-buying will
be revised down in the near term given the FOMC
members pursuit of "sustainable job growth" –
reiterated in the latest statement and press
conference (March 2013).
Major fiscal challenges ahead

While the US "fiscal cliff" has been avoided
(January 2) and the government shut-down averted
(March 21), US fiscal policy continues to generate
significant uncertainty and remains the most
important domestic risk.

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

In the short term there is the need to raise the debt
ceiling whose suspension expires on May 19.
Given that the Treasury will be able to pay its bills
for about ten subsequent weeks, negotiations will
most likely continue well into the summer, as they
did two years ago during the previous debt limit
crisis. Back then the debate proved highly
disruptive, weighed heavily on consumer and
business sentiment, and contributed to the
downgrade of the US debt by one of the rating
agencies. There is some hope that this time
negotiations may be more orderly with both parties
well aware of the political cost associated with the
blame for the gridlock.

from the winter forecast. Business and residential
investment will be the strongest growth drivers in
the forecast horizon, contributing more than half
(2013) and half (2014) of the GDP growth. On the
other hand, fiscal policy will remain a drag on
growth as it is likely to be tightened significantly
in 2013 – reflecting the combination of the tax
hikes and sequestration cuts. The resulting fiscal
consolidation is expected to reach 2% of GDP in
2013 – up from 1.2% in 2012 – and then ease to
around 1% of GDP in 2014.
Policy uncertainty remains a major risk

Policy uncertainty remains the biggest domestic
risk for the forecast. If the disruptive stand-off is
repeated over the debt ceiling, this will weigh on
confidence, consumption and investment and
ultimately GDP growth in the forecast horizon. If,
on the other hand, orderly negotiations improve
prospects of addressing the medium and long-term
fiscal challenges and putting the debt-to-GDP ratio
on a downward trend, this is likely to boost
sentiment and growth.

Moreover, the debate on the budget for the fiscal
year 2014 is unfolding gradually and may soon
merge with the debt ceiling negotiations. The
House and the Senate each passed irreconcilable
budget proposals in late March. President Obama's
budget announced on 10 April seeks to draw
Republicans into a fiscal compromise by reducing
spending on some social programmes but also
suggesting additional taxes – in line with policy
priorities of his own party.
The GDP growth forecasts for 2013 and 2014
remain at 1.9% and 2.6%, respectively, unchanged

35. JAPAN
Stronger near-term growth prospects
Growth outlook has improved…

In 2013 real GDP is forecast to grow by 1.4% (up
from 1.0% in the winter forecast) as fiscal
expansion, further easing in financing conditions
and a projected improvement in export
performance are expected to further support
growth over the second half of the year. However
the planned 2014 consumption tax hike could
dampen growth from the second quarter of next
year onwards. For this reason overall growth for
2014 is projected at 1.6%, unchanged with respect
to the winter forecast.
Real GDP growth was flat in the last quarter of
2012, marking a stabilisation after two consecutive
declines in the second and third quarters. Starting
from a low 2011 base, Japan's economy grew by
2.0% in 2012, mainly sustained by robust private
consumption (2.4%), government expenditure
(2.7%) and public investment (12.5%), whereas
net exports acted as a drag on growth with a
negative contribution of 0.9 pp.
Resilience in private consumption is likely to
continue over the course of this year notably on the
back of improvements in consumer sentiment,
wealth effects from rising stock market valuations
(the Nikkei 225 index has climbed up by 55% over
the past eight months and is now back to its June
2008 levels), and ultra-easy financing conditions.
In addition, a front-loading of households'
expenditure is expected in anticipation of the 2014
consumption tax hike.

After remaining stagnant throughout 2012, the
consumer confidence index has started increasing
markedly from January, reaching its highest levels
since 2007 and suggesting that positive consumer
sentiment may start materialising into higher
spending. The retail sales index also started to
increase in February (1.7% m-o-m).
In 2012 gross fixed capital formation was mainly
underpinned by strong public investment (12.5%)
and residential investment growth (2.9%) on the
back of strong reconstruction spending, whereas
business investment remained more subdued
(2.0%). Public investment is projected to continue
on a growth trend supported by fiscal stimulus
measures. As for business investment, February
data for machinery orders (7.5% m-o-m), a leading
indicator for
capital expenditure, marked a
rebound with respect to January, but do not point
yet to a sustained improvement. Further easing in
financing conditions and stronger export
competitiveness are however expected to underpin
business investment over the forecast horizon.
After being on a declining trend for eight months,
industrial production rose in December 2012 and
stablised in the first two months of 2013. Soft
indicators for January and February point to a
marginal improvement in business sentiment,
which however are not reflected in hard data so
far. However, with some delay better business
expectations would materialise into a gradual pickup of industrial production over the coming
quarters, also on the back of stronger export
growth driven by the steep depreciation of the yen.
External demand has not yet fully responded to the
yen depreciation, and the pass-through from the
weaker yen to energy prices has so far offset the
positive impact of the export recovery on net trade.
Real exports to the United States remained
resilient throughout 2012 and appear to be
growing, whereas real exports to China and the EU
remain subdued but are expected to rebound.
External demand should gradually pick up over the
forecast horizon in line with the weak yen and
growth in export markets, whereas dependency on
fossil fuel imports will keep weighing on the trade
balance over the coming years. All in all, net
exports would contribute positively to economic
growth in 2013, after being a drag in 2012.

Other non-EU Countries, Japan

The unemployment rate remained low in February
(4.3%) and is expected to stay at such levels over
the forecast horizon in line with tiny employment
growth and a stable labour force. The participation
rate is on a long-term downward path, and fell to
its lowest ever recorded level of 58.5% in
December. Nominal wage growth remains subdued
(-0.7% y-o-y in February), whereas the number of
part-time workers kept rising, marginally replacing
regular workers (2.9% against -0.5% y-o-y in
February).

trend is reversed and higher inflation expectations
become firmly entrenched.

…supported by bold monetary policy

Risks and challenges ahead

Deflation remained entrenched in 2012 but showed
some signs of easing, as the CPI index edged up
from -0.3% y-o-y in 2011 to 0.0% y-o-y in 2012.
However, recent seasonally-adjusted CPI readings
do not point yet to a reversal in the deflationary
trend (-0.6% y-o-y in February). The one-off effect
of the consumption tax hike due in April 2014 and
the pass-through from higher import prices will
wane over time, and the extent to which the 2%
inflation target is sustained will largely depend on
whether the present negative nominal wage growth

The main risk is that Japan’s monetary policy is
not adequately complemented by the necessary
fiscal consolidation and structural economic
reforms. Despite lower borrowing costs in the near
term, there is no room for complacency given
Japan's growing debt-to-GDP ratio, which calls for
a strong and credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan. Tepid or insufficient structural
economic reforms would also dampen Japan’s
growth prospects, and in turn negatively affect its
debt sustainability.

Monetary policy will remain ultra-loose over the
forecast horizon. The Bank of Japan delivered on
its pledge to undertake "whatever is necessary" to
exit from deflation, and committed to double the
monetary base and expand its balance sheet by a
projected 26% in 2013 and 35% in 2014, the
largest scale of expansion among major central
banks.

36. CHINA
A recovery that has yet to take hold
compared to the same quarter of 2012, while
imports grew by only 8.5%.

A continued slow recovery

China's economy grew by 7.7% in the first quarter
of 2013, compared to 7.9% in the last quarter of
2012, and 7.8% for 2012 as a whole. This confirms
that while China appears to have avoided a hard
landing, growth remains subdued compared to
China's average growth rate during the last decade.
High frequency indicators remain mixed, with
positive manufacturing survey data slow to feed
through into measures of real activity.
After falling sharply in early 2012, domestic
consumption proved resilient during the rest of the
year and early 2013. Retail sales picked up
noticeably in the second half of 2012, before
slipping back a little in the early months of 2013.

Fixed asset investment

Fixed asset investment also slowed abruptly during
the early months of 2012. The slowdown was most
marked in real estate, with a fall from over 30%
growth in nominal terms to around 20%, thanks in
part to targetted policy measures to calm property
markets. A subsequent increase in infrastructure
approvals in mid 2012 helped stabilise growth of
fixed asset investment at just over 20% towards the
end of 2012 and into the first quarter of 2013.
Export growth was flat through the first three
quarters of 2012, then picked up in the last quarter,
while import growth remained slack. This allowed
China to register a current-account surplus of 2.3%
of GDP in 2012, as compared to 1.9% in 2011.
Exports followed this pattern in the first quarter of
2013, with a growth of 18.4% (in value terms),

118

Overall, consumption (public and private)
provided the largest positive contribution to
growth in the first quarter of 2013 (4.3 pps.) while
investment contributed 2.3 pps. and net exports
contributed 1.1 pps. The consumption contribution
has been stable for several quarters, while the
improved contribution of net exports is in sharp
contrast to 2012, during which net exports were a
drag on growth.
A mixed outlook

Consumption is likely to remain the principal
driver of growth in 2013, underpinned by three
main factors. First, rapid growth in wages is likely
to increase household incomes. Second, real
interest rates remain positive, implying rising
earnings on household deposits and an increase in
financial wealth. Third, policy is likely to continue
to be supportive for households' income with a
continuation of measures to broaden the social
security net, as well as to support spending directly
via measures to boost "green" consumption. Fixed
asset investment is expected to remain steady
through 2013, though the pace may quicken if real
estate investment continues to accelerate. While
this would be positive in terms of the short-term
outlook for demand, the share of real estate in total
investment is already high, and further growth
would raise concerns about longer term
sustainability.
Monetary policy remains accommodative. Policy
interest rates were lowered in the middle of 2012
and have since remained stable with the policy
lending rate at 6% and the policy deposit rate at
3%. Interbank rates fell sharply during the first
half of 2012 and have subsequently moved in a
relatively narrow range between 3 and 4%.
Inflation has also remained subdued. After falling
sharply during 2012, it has remained around 2%,
though recent months have seen some volatility in
the headline rate. Growth in credit on the other
hand has picked up sharply in the last two to three
quarters, with very rapid growth in Total Social
financing (an official measure of aggregate credit
flow to the economy).

China remains exposed to a possible worsening of
the international environment, but the principal
risk factors remain domestic. The risk of a sharp
slump driven by falling investment demand has
receded. However, China faces a considerable
challenge to maintain robust domestic demand
while at the same time rotating demand away from
investment and towards consumption, as is needed
if China's growth model is to be "rebalanced" and
made sustainable in the medium term. The risk of
an unbalanced adjustment remains real.

Total social financing (rhs)

As regards the external sector, it is unlikely that
the rapid growth rates of exports seen in early
months of 2013 can be maintained, given the likely
slow recovery in world trade, and the short-term
prospects for the EU and the US, both major
trading partners. In addition, the real effective
exchange rate of the RMB has appreciated by
around 5% over the last 6 months which will act as
a modest drag on export growth. Balancing these
various developments, the current projections
remain unchanged from the winter forecast, at 8%
growth in 2013 and 8.1% in 2014.

The presence of rapid credit growth and growing
financial disintermediation in spite of sluggish
activity also suggests that stresses exist in the
financial sector. Inflation remains low at present,
but may pick up quickly if excess productive
capacity proves to be limited. A rapid rise in
inflation would lower real interest rates, and
encourage diversification into real assets, in
particular property, thereby reigniting speculative
bubbles. The scope for a more rapid recovery
might therefore be constrained by the need to keep
the domestic inflation rate at a level that is
consistent with financial stability.

Embedding resilience
Historically
low
interest
rates,
robust
developments in real disposable incomes due to
low or negative inflation rates combined with
strong labour markets and an overall limited
deterioration in foreign demand for their export
products, have supported growth in Norway and
Switzerland.
Labour migration supportive of resilience now
and in the future

Labour migration has given an additional impetus
to domestic demand at a time when other European
countries struggled to achieve positive growth.
Historically, Switzerland and, to a lesser extent,
Norway, have attracted temporary inflows in times
of tightening labour markets. This has helped
dampen the effect of the business cycle on national
employment which can also be seen in their low
Okun coefficient.
Between 2008 and 2011, the highly-educated
foreign work force expanded by 18.6% in
Switzerland and by 33.4% in Norway. Of these
expansions, 96% and 56% respectively can be
explained by migration from the EU. For
comparison, in Germany only 35% of the increase
(by 23.7% over the same period) in highlyeducated labour migration can be traced back to
other EU Member States. Switzerland and Norway
are the only countries where total EU immigration
raises the share of the highly-educated in the total
workforce.

Reigniting engine of foreign demand
Switzerland

for

The Swiss economy has continued to show
resilience supported mostly by domestic demand.
Foreign demand is expected to increasingly
support economic growth in Switzerland while
domestic demand growth becomes less buoyant.
The risk that domestic demand loses steam before
foreign demand picks up seems limited, because
the low interest rates that boosted domestic
demand are coupled with external developments.
As soon as the global economy gains momentum,
foreign demand for the broader range of Swiss
export products should pick up but demand for
Swiss assets should diminish leading to a
tightening of domestic financial conditions. Labour
market developments have been so robust that it is
unlikely that unemployment becomes a threat to
private domestic demand.
A first risk to the outlook is that the property
market has deviated too much from its
fundamentals. Secondly, reversing the large
expansion of liquidity may prove a challenge to
monetary policy if the risk premium on other
economies suddenly falls. In combination with the
tight labour market and strong private consumption
this might push up inflationary pressures. These
risks seem limited although vigilance is warranted
in policy making.
Gross fixed capital investment has been less
responsive to the low interest rates than would
normally be expected. On the other hand,
inventories have positively contributed to
economic growth in the past two years. This is
expected to reverse as domestic investment is
projected to contribute positively to economic
growth while inventories are expected to be scaled
down. Building activity is set to slow down, in
particular due to the limitations on second homes.

The cyclical upturn starting in 2011 has continued
in Norway throughout 2012. Domestic demand has
been fuelling growth in the Norwegian economy,
helped by favourable domestic conditions and a
thriving oil sector. Robust wage and employment
growth, along with very low inflation and interest

rates, have boosted consumer purchasing power.
Additionally, activity benefited from a strong
rebound in the petroleum and transport sector by
the end of 2012. As a result, 2012 annual real GDP
grew by 3.2%, from 1.2% in the previous year,
which represented the strongest expansion
observed since 2004.

growth (2.5%). Subsequently, the assumed higher
interest rates are likely to curb consumption and
investment impetus, which is expected to be
partially offset by a recovery in the external sector,
resulting in GDP growth return to trend by 2014.
The krone appreciation and the resulting lower
import prices have kept inflation low despite high
global energy costs, strong economic growth and
rapid wage growth. Slowly these effects are
expected to wane and inflation to increase towards
2.5% in 2014.

Moreover, high level of disposable income and
expectations for continued strong labour market,
along with high oil prices, are expected to ensure
sustained consumption and investment growth in
2013, albeit slower than the previous, very high
rates. Investment in mainland industries is also
expected to increase, but at lower rates than in
previous economic upturns due to the weak
international
momentum.
The
worsened
perspectives for Norway's trading partners since
the beginning of the year, together with continual
losses of cost-competitiveness in Norwegian
businesses, due to the previous krone appreciation,
would lead to a weak development in traditional
Norwegian exports. But this would be largely
compensated by the still good prospects for the oil
services sector. As a result, GDP is projected to
decelerate in 2013 and slightly surpass trend

These forecasts are subject predominantly to
downside risks. One stems from the uncertain
outlook for the global economy and the risk of a
renewed recession in the euro area, including a
deeper banking crisis with a resulting lack of
liquidity and lower growth. Moreover, turmoil in
the financial markets of other advanced economies
could raise capital flows into Norway causing a
further appreciation of the krone while pushing the
domestic interest rate below equilibrium levels.
This would enhance risks of asset bubbles which
are especially worrisome for the property markets
where prices are already relatively high, which is
mirrored in high indebtedness of households.

38. RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Structural reforms needed to ensure growth
Russia recovered quickly from the sharp drop in
GDP it experienced in 2009. But, reflecting the
global slowdown but also specific Russian
structural weaknesses, the pace of growth has
weakened steadily in recent time, with a rate of
expansion of 3.4% in 2012, and only 2.1% y-o-y in
the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the key question
among signs of weak growth in 2013 is whether
Russia will be able to counteract this trend without
the support of rising commodity prices.
Russia is now projected to grow 3.3% in 2013 and
3.8% in 2014, still fairly close to its estimated
potential. However, weak data at the start of the
year means that achieving these growth rates
requires a strong pick-up in the course of 2013.

growth remained buoyant. On fiscal policy, the
Russian federal budget recorded a small deficit of
0.1% of GDP in 2012, but the non-oil budget
deficit widened considerably, to around 10.6% of
GDP.
Elevated inflation inhibits policy

Inflation was subdued in the first half of 2012, but
picked up in the second half of the year. Despite
the benchmark refinancing rate being raised by 25
bps to 8.25% in September, the Central Bank of
Russia's inflation target of 5-6% at the end of the
year was missed. Inflation has since increased
further, averaging 7.1% y-o-y in the first quarter of
2013, preventing a more accommodative monetary
policy.

Weakness spreading to the first quarter of 2013

During the course of 2012, annual GDP growth of
4.9% (all y-o-y) in the first quarter moderated to
4.0% in the second quarter, 2.9% in the third and
2.1% in the final quarter according to the national
statistical
office.
Household
consumption
remained the most important driver of growth
while investment slowed considerably and
government consumption was flat. In line with
gross fixed capital formation, industrial production
growth also decelerated steadily in 2012. Monthly
data for the first quarter of 2013 indicates that this
trend continued in January and February before
recovering somewhat in March. Retail sales
displayed the same pattern, making a further
slowdown in the first quarter of 2013 likely. The
unemployment rate has nudged up to 5.7% in
March, but still near historical lows. In line with
this indication of a tight labour market, wage

122

Trade followed the pattern familiar from previous
years, with import growth far exceeding that of
exports, reflecting both lower demand from
Russia's main trading partners and the beginning of
a demand shift in the gas market. The merchandise
trade surplus decreased to 9.5% of GDP in 2012
and net exports continue to contribute negatively
to economic growth.
Expectations as measured by the composite PMI
have mirrored the recent decline in monthly data as
well as the global outlook, but are still firmly in
expansionary territory, at 51.7 in March.
Recovery in late 2013 but structural challenges
remain ahead

The forecast growth rate of 3.3% in 2013 implies a
relatively rapid pickup in growth this year, as the
economy is likely to rebound from the recent
weakness. Present underlying trends are largely set
to continue across the forecast horizon, with
household consumption growth moderating
somewhat, and public consumption contributing
only to a limited extent to economic growth.
Export volumes are expected to increase at a
somewhat faster pace in 2013 (3.2% y-o-y) and
2014 (5.2% y-o-y), in part reflecting improvements
in the global economic outlook, while imports will
grow below trend on the back of slower
consumption growth. The negative contribution of
net exports is thus projected to lessen over the
forecast horizon. The decline in the benchmark oil
price to USD 104.9/bbl in 2013 and to USD

Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation

99.2/bbl in 2014 is likely to have negative effects
on investment in the energy sector.

growth. Overall, the federal budget is expected to
close with a slight deficit across the forecast
horizon.

Policy uncertainty to outlook

In monetary policy, the appointment of Elvira
Nabiullina to take over as governor of the Central
Bank of Russia in June 2013 raised expectations of
a significant departure from the 11-year
administration of the retiring Sergei Ignatyev.
While any change is likely to be gradual,
promoting economic growth may become a more
explicit target next to price stability. As it is,
inflation is projected to level off from its elevated
rate over the forecast horizon.

Despite relatively high oil prices, the slowing of
economic expansion progressed faster than
expected. This is reflected in downward revisions
to GDP forecasts for 2013, as for instance by the
Russian Ministry of Economic Development (from
3.6% to 2.4%). This has given rise to renewed
discussion of policy measures, including a
potential fiscal stimulus employing reserve funds.
This may affect efforts in the 2013-15 budget –
a.o. the newly instated fiscal rule linking
expenditure to long-term oil prices introduced only
in January 2013 – for further fiscal consolidation
and the projected progressive reduction in non-oil
deficits. Proposals comprise increased spending on
education, healthcare, infrastructure projects and
amplify public sector wages. The implementation
of such selected measures in line with mediumterm fiscal targets may contribute to addressing
structural growth challenges. Improvements in the
business environment and the modernisation of the
economy are needed to underpin sustainable

The present forecast is for the Russian economy to
continue on a moderate growth path, implying no
disruption in the short term and some improvement
of the external outlook along with a supportive
domestic environment in the medium term. With
important policy decisions taken at the end of 2012
and first months of 2013 affecting developments,
risks for the forecasts appear balanced. Over the
medium term, improvements in the business
environment and the modernisation of the
economy are needed to underpin sustainable
growth.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fullyfledged economic forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn.
These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic
aggregates for the Member States, the candidate countries,
the European Union as a whole, the euro area and the
international environment.
2. Data for 2013 and 2014 are forecasts.
The source for all tables is the European Commission,
unless otherwise stated.
Historical data for the Member States are based on the European
System of Accounting (ESA 1995). Most Member States have
now introduced chain-linking in their national accounts to measure
the development of economic aggregates in volume terms.
For the USA and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.

aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates.
Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area "adjusted"
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-à-vis
third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of
the individual countries in the EU or the euro area. However,
intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of
reporting errors. The creation of the internal market in 1993
reduced border controls and formalities, and accordingly the
scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage. Typically,
intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU exports,
leading to an overestimation of the surplus. For the past the
"adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB
estimates for the euro area. For the future, they are ECFIN's
forecasts based on the extrapolation of the discrepancies
observed in 2012.
9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :

3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4. In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for USA
and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 1996.
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment
and the NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 22-26, 28 and 32-33 are based on
full-time-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France
Italy, the Netherlands and Austria report FTE data. In the
absence of FTE data, employment is based on numbers of persons.
In the calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates, priority is given to
FTE data, as this is regarded as more representative of diverse
patterns of working time.
7. Source: National Accounts (ESA95). Discrepancies with balance
of payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences
and revision schedules.
8. EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates.
World GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS).
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the

Euro area :
EA17 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LU, MT, NL, AT, PT, SI, SK and FI)
European Union
EU27 (EA17, BG, CZ, DK, LV ,LT, HU, PL, RO, SE and UK)
Acceding countries :
Croatia.
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Iceland, Montenegro and Serbia.
Potential candidates :
Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.
Asia :
All countries in that region except Japan and
the Asian MENA countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA countries.
