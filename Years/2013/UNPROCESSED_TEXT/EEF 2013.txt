EDITORIAL
The EU economy is slowly coming out of contraction. In financial markets, risk premia have decreased,
notably for sovereigns and banks in vulnerable countries. Market participants have regained confidence in
the integrity of the euro area and in the determination of the EU and its Members States to bring public
debt back on a sustainable path and to move forward with the necessary post-crisis adjustments, be they
macroeconomic, structural or institutional.
The negative feedback loops between fragile public finances, vulnerable banks and a weak
macroeconomy that had fuelled the sovereign-debt crisis in the first half of 2012 have been weakened.
However, the improved financial market situation contrasts with the absence of credit growth and the
weakness of the near-term outlook for economic activity – even though some signs of a turnaround are
now discernible. This dichotomy is to a large extent explained by the broad adjustment process weighing
on short-term growth. Balance-sheet adjustment among banks, households, non-financial corporations
and sovereigns is accounting for a large part of the conspicuous frailty of credit and domestic demand.
Also, the necessary shift of resources from sectors that had grown unsustainably in the pre-crisis years
towards the production of tradable goods and services is holding back output in the short run. At the same
time, uncertainty about the macro-financial situation is affecting spending decisions by firms and
households and this has been a strong vector transmitting vulnerability from some Member States to the
rest of the euro area and EU.
What next? The present forecast projects a return to moderate growth in the course of this year, as
confidence gradually recovers and the global economy becomes more supportive again, while the
abovementioned factors continue to weigh on domestic demand. This general improvement is marked by
different developments across Member States, with economic growth in some already re-accelerating at
present while in others GDP is only expected to bottom out in the second half of the year. Yet the
contraction in economic activity in vulnerable Member States conceals an undercurrent of ongoing
adjustment fostered by recent reforms with increasing competitiveness and the improvement in current
accounts becoming structural. Progress in this respect is in turn expected to contribute to a strengthening
of growth in 2014.
The labour market, however, is a serious concern. Employment is forecast to shrink further for some
quarters, and unemployment remains unacceptably high in the EU as whole and even more so in the
Member States facing the largest adjustment needs. This has grave social consequences and will, if
unemployment becomes structurally entrenched, also weigh on growth perspectives going forward.
The relief in financial markets and the prospective recovery have to be used to press ahead relentlessly
with the policy agenda to ensure the sustainability of public finances, overcome financial fragmentation,
implement growth-supporting structural reforms, lift employment and strengthen the architecture of
EMU. If we want the current thaw to lead to springtime for the EU economy, there must be no
procrastination.

OVERVIEW
EU economy
bottoming out…

Since the summer of 2012, financial market conditions in the EU have
improved substantially as perceived tail risks of EMU break-up receded, but
this improvement has not yet fed through to the real economy. Economic
activity has been disappointing in the second half of last year, and there are
only now some signals from leading indicators that GDP in the EU is
bottoming out. The weakness of domestic demand stemming from the
adjustment of internal and external imbalances and notably from
deleveraging is expected to fade only slowly. In 2013, external demand is
thus set to be the main driver of the projected stabilisation and gradual
acceleration of economic activity in the EU. Domestic investment and
consumption are projected to recover only later in the year, but by 2014
domestic demand is expected to take over as the main driver of further
strengthening GDP growth.

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

2

… and moving back
to modest growth in
the course of the year.

The weakness in economic activity towards the end of 2012 implies a low
starting point for the current year. Combined with a more gradual return of
growth than earlier expected, this leads to a projection of almost unchanged
annual GDP in 2013 in the EU, while annual GDP in the euro area is
expected to contract by ¼%. Quarterly GDP developments are somewhat
more dynamic than the annual figures suggest, and GDP in the fourth quarter
of this year is forecast to be 1% above the level reached in the last quarter of
2012 in the EU, and ¾% in the euro area. Nevertheless, the current weakness
in economic activity is expected to have a negative impact on labour markets
with unemployment rates increasing further this year to 11% in the EU and
12% in the euro area. HICP inflation is projected to decrease to 2.0% in the
EU and 1.8% in the euro area in 2013.

Global conditions are
becoming more
supportive again …

There are some indications that the global economy is slowly moving out of
the soft patch that marked 2012, when global GDP growth slowed down,
partly reflecting spillovers from the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area, but
also drags originating in other regions. Growth in advanced economies is,
however, expected to remain moderate. In the US, housing and labour
markets have improved, but growth surprised on the downside in the fourth
quarter of 2012 and the very near-term outlook remains clouded by
uncertainty related to the fiscal stance. In Japan, the latest economic stimulus
package is expected to offset the recent slowdown and sustain economic
activity in 2013, while growth in emerging market economies appears to have
bottomed out. The soft patch in global activity also affected world trade,
which lost momentum over the first three quarters of last year before
resuming more robust growth. For this year as a whole, global non-EU GDP
growth is projected at 4% reflecting a gradual re-acceleration in the course of
the year. On the back of the stronger momentum in global output growth,
world trade outside the EU is expected to grow by 4½%. While commodity
prices have been volatile in 2012, concerns about a renewed food-price crisis
have not materialised. The oil price is assumed to average 114 USD/bbl (84
EUR/bbl) this year and to decrease moderately by 2014.

… while financial
market stress has
eased on the back
policy, …

Important policy measures adopted since the summer of 2012 have curbed
the soaring sovereign-debt crisis and weakened the vicious circles that had
previously fuelled the rapid worsening of the crisis. Measures notably
comprise structural and fiscal reforms at the Member State level, but also the
creation of the ECB's OMT programme, the decision to set up a Single
Supervisory Mechanism as a first step towards Banking Union, the adoption
of the ESM, the strengthening of the institutional framework of EMU, the
agreement on the second programme for Greece and structural reform at the
Member-State level. In combination, these have led to a shift in markets'
assessment of the viability of EMU and the fiscal sustainability of its
members.

… and confidence is
improving, …

Although financial markets still remain fragile, the return of calmer
conditions should lay the basis for a gradual return of confidence among
households and businesses and lead to a return of moderate growth of
domestic demand. Indeed, confidence indicators for the EU have increased
since October 2012, though they remain at low levels. Together with other
leading indicators such as industrial production, this suggests that the
economy is bottoming out.

Overview

… but domestic
demand is set to
return only gradually

The weakness of domestic demand reflects ongoing adjustments triggered by
the financial crisis. Among its main components, gross fixed capital
formation has contracted particularly strongly in 2012. At the current stage,
consumption and investment are still being held back by a combination of
cyclical weakness, pervasive uncertainty as well as the protracted adjustment
of balance sheets and production factors that is typical for the aftermath of
deep financial crises. Across most of the EU Member States, low capacity
utilisation and low expected profits are weighing on business investment,
while the weakness of real disposable income growth related to depressed
labour markets, inflation persistence and recent tax increases are holding
back consumption. Moreover, uncertainty tends to lead firms and households
to delay spending decisions.
Factors relating to the necessary external rebalancing and balance-sheet
consolidation are weighing on Member States to different degrees. Financing
conditions remain difficult in Member States where banks are attempting to
strengthen their balance sheets and/or have not yet regained access to market
funding. As non-financial corporations and households are also deleveraging,
weak bank lending reflects a combination of low credit demand and tight
credit supply conditions. Fiscal consolidation is weighing on growth in the
short-run, and so does the ongoing reallocation of resources. These factors
are set to depress growth in the vulnerable Member States for the larger part
of this year. Going forward, these drags are, however, expected to diminish
gradually as uncertainty fades, confidence returns and adjustment starts
bearing fruit, thereby opening the way for a gradual return of consumption
and investment growth.

While growth
divergences persist,
adjustment is ongoing
…

But it is clear that the different factors affecting domestic demand will
continue to cause substantial growth differentials across Member States.
Among the largest Member States, in Germany re-accelerating global trade
and a strengthening of domestic demand on the back of increasing confidence
are set to yield a fairly robust rebound. Weak real disposable incomes and
subdued investment are forecast to weigh on activity, leading to a more
gradual expansion of GDP in France. The Italian economy is forecast to
climb out of recession in mid-2013 as improving confidence and financing
conditions are expected to allow a rebound in investment. In Spain, GDP is
expected to bottom out towards the end of 2013 as the internal and external
rebalancing proceeds. Domestic demand in the Netherlands remains
constrained by the housing market adjustment, but gradual growth supported
by net exports is forecast to return in the course of 2013. Among the Member
States outside the euro area, activity in the UK is forecast to rebound as
consumption continues to firm gradually and investment catches up. In
Poland, the softness of domestic demand is projected to be temporary, with
GDP growth set to progressively gather speed.
Meanwhile, the adjustment of internal and external imbalances is continuing.
There is evidence that a shift in production factors from non-tradables to
tradables sectors is contributing to the reduction of current-account deficits in
vulnerable economies. At the same time, consumption is expected to hold up
relatively well in countries with a current-account surplus, an indication of an
increased reliance on domestic demand as growth driver.

… and fiscal
adjustment
progressing.

As many Member States implemented sizeable fiscal measures in 2012,
headline deficits are expected to have fallen to 3¾% in the EU and 3½% the
euro area. Another reduction to 3½% in the EU and 2¾% in the euro area is
projected in 2013. The adjustment in the structural budget balance is

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

projected to advance at a slightly slower pace this year. Despite the ongoing
fiscal consolidation, debt-to-GDP ratios are still forecast to increase in 2013
due to the more negative contribution of real GDP growth and – in the case
of the EU but not the euro area – to persistent primary deficits.
Labour markets hardhit

While the sharp recession of 2009 was accompanied by exceptional
employment resilience, the recent GDP contractions are expected to result in
employment losses that are more in line with past experience in similar
economic environments. This is explained on the one hand by continued
labour shedding in sectors that had grown unsustainably in the pre-crisis
years, on the other by the fact that the scope for the adjustment in working
hours has largely been used up. However, the labour-market outlook differs a
lot across Member States, and much of the projected increase in
unemployment is projected to occur in just a few Member States. High and
persistent unemployment in turn bears the risk of becoming structural as the
skills of unemployed workers depreciate. This could affect the economies'
growth potential going forward.

Inflation set to ease

In the light of high unemployment and large output gaps, domestic price
pressures are expected to remain subdued. Core inflation has been falling
very gradually in 2012 and is expected to hover at a rate around 1.8% in the
EU and 1.7% in the euro area by the end of the forecast horizon. Given the
technical assumption of slightly decreasing commodities prices and the
lagged impact of the recent euro appreciation, imported price pressures are
also projected to wane. As a result, consumer-price inflation in the EU is
forecast to decrease gradually in the course of 2013 and to stabilise around
1.7% in the EU and 1.5% in the euro area next year.

Risks have become
more balanced

The decrease in financial market stress indicates that risks to the integrity of
EMU have substantially faded over the past quarters. Nonetheless,
uncertainty is still high and downside risks remain. The effective
implementation of the policies to reinforce EMU and foster the necessary
adjustments are crucial to keep at bay the risk of another aggravation of the
sovereign-debt crisis, which could lead to renewed financial-market turmoil
and derail the prospective recovery. Other downside risks relate to an even
faster growth of joblessness feeding back into domestic demand and
endangering the implementation of reforms as well as the uncertain fiscal
policy outlook combined with large medium-term budgetary challenges in
the US and Japan.
Upside risks to GDP growth could materialise if the progress with crisis
resolution and structural reforms in the euro area is faster and/or the return of
confidence stronger than expected. On the external side, upside risks relate to
a sustainable solution of the fiscal impasse in the US or a stronger rebound of
growth in emerging markets on the back of macroeconomic policy easing or
structural reforms. While downside risks to the growth forecast still prevail,
the risk distribution has become more balanced since the autumn 2012
forecast. Risks to the inflation outlook appear balanced.

Economic developments at the aggregated
level

THE EU ECONOMY: GRADUALLY OVERCOMING
HEADWINDS
Financial market conditions improved significantly in recent months, but as parts of the EU economy
remain in the grip of a balance-sheet recession with adverse financing conditions, private and public
deleveraging needs and high unemployment, the transmission of the improvements to the real economy
is set to be slow.
Real GDP in the EU shrunk by 0.5% in the final quarter of 2012, while the euro area moved deeper into
recession and contracted by 0.6%. However, the latest readings of survey indicators suggest that both
the EU economy and the euro area are bottoming out at the beginning of this year. Based on the
assumption that the consistent implementation of policy decisions at the national and EU level will
continue to reduce uncertainty and increase confidence, output is forecast to stabilise in the EU and the
euro area in the first half of 2013. But a weaker-than-expected final quarter of 2012 is set to shift the
inception of the recovery towards mid-2013.
With the projected gradual reacceleration of global economic growth in the course of 2013 and the
implied pick-up in external demand net exports are expected to be the dominant growth driver this year.
In contrast, domestic demand is still held back by overall low sentiment and, in particular, by the
adjustment process in vulnerable countries. But the predicted improvement in financing conditions
across vulnerable Member States coupled with a general rise in confidence will allow domestic demand
to recover gradually in the course of 2013 and to become the major contributor to GDP growth in 2014.
Amid large cross-country disparities, the EU and the euro-area economy are set to have contracted by
0.3% and 0.6% in 2012 respectively. Given the substantial structural challenges in some euro-area
Member States the currency area is still likely to contract by ¼% this year, while GDP in the EU is
forecast to remain broadly unchanged. In 2014, both areas are forecast to grow by around 1½%.
Inflation is predicted to abate gradually over the forecast horizon, as the impact of fiscal consolidation
measures and commodity-price hikes are waning, and the weak labour market limits the scope for
nominal wage increases and helps avoiding an inflationary impact of outstanding liquidity provisions.
After averaging 2.6% and 2.5% in the EU and the euro area respectively in 2012, HICP inflation is
expected to fall below 2% in both areas in the course of this year. In 2014, consumer prices are forecast
to increase by 1.7% in the EU and 1.5% in the euro area.
In response to the substantial reduction in tail risks and financial market stress risks to the growth
outlook have become more balanced but continue to be tilted to the downside. In contrast, risks are
balanced for the inflation outlook.

THE DOUBLE
ECONOMY

DISPARITY

OF

THE

EU

The weakening of global growth and the
aggravation of the sovereign-debt crisis in the first
half of last year, reflecting high deleveraging needs
in the public and private sector, have shackled
economic activity throughout 2012 and pushed the
euro area back into a recession. At the beginning
of 2013, the EU economy is characterised by a
double disparity. Firstly, the improvement in
financial market conditions contrasts visibly with
the weakness of the real economy. Secondly,
growth differentials across Member States remain
very large.
Economic policy response has set in motion a
substantial yet still fragile improvement in
financial market conditions …

Since the summer, financial market stress has
eased substantially following decisive policy
actions. Fiscal and structrual reforms at the
Member State level acompanied by the entering
into force of the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM), the ECB announcement to introduce a new
conditional asset purchase programme for
undertaking outright monetary transactions in
secondary markets for sovereign bonds (OMT), the
adoption of a second programme for Greece and
the European Council decision on the Single
Supervisory Mechanism as a further step towards a
banking union have contributed to easing
sovereign funding stress, alleviating tensions in
financial markets and tackling the negative
feedback loops that had contributed to the
exacerbation of the sovereign-debt crisis. As a
consequence, both financial market and policy
uncertainty (1) have declined markedly over the last
months. However, uncertainty related to economic
prospects remains at high levels and financing
conditions for the private sector still vary widely
across EU Member States. Finally, confidence in
the non-financial sector has only very recently
started improving and is still relatively low.

near future remains subdued. With the large
internal and external rebalancing needs that
typically characterise the aftermath of deep debt
crises and often entail balance-sheet recessions, a
strong rebound of domestic demand was not to be
expected. (2) In particular, the improvement of the
financial market situation has not yet impacted on
credit growth which is still marked by low demand
and tight bank lending conditions to households
and non-financial corporations. Moreover,
uncertainty has had a strong and lasting impact on
domestic demand, given that high levels of
uncertainty are generally associated with
households and corporations cutting back on
spending, investment and employment. The
combination of these drags is clearly reflected in
the double-dip of domestic demand. (3)
… economic prospects for EU Member States
remain diverse …

The second disparity concerns the macroeconomic
situation across EU Member States, which is likely
to remain diverse according to different external
and internal rebalancing needs, labour market
situations, and export capacities in terms of regions
and products. In particular, economic activity in
Member States where domestic demand is less
constrained by structural challenges or adverse
financing conditions is expected to recover
relatively fast, while growth in those Member
States that are still mired in a balance-sheet
recession is set to take longer to return. But
disparities are also observable at the sector level
within countries, and in particular in some
vulnerable Member States, where a relatively good
export performance is predicted to contrast sharply
with subdued domestic demand.
… and policy commitments remain crucial.

The policy commitments made since early summer
2012 have paved the way for an enduring crisis
resolution. Against this backdrop, the forecast is

… but the real-side recovery is lagging …

Despite the substantial easing of financial market
tensions and the recent tentative rise in confidence

based on the assumption that adopted measures
and further policy advances will continue to
prevent a re-escalation of the sovereign-debt crisis
and move gradually forward to an ultimate crisis
solution. In practice, the EU-wide implementation
of agreed policy measures is assumed to contain
financial market stress effectively, ease lending
conditions across peripheral Member States and
boost private sector confidence. This assumption is
subject to the remaining high uncertainty which is
related to the still fragile EU financial sector, the
need to reduce debt levels in the public and private
sector in several Member States and the risk of
negative spillovers from the euro-area periphery to
other Member States and beyond.

2.

Outside the EU, growth in the US surprised on the
low side in the last quarter of 2012 as real GDP
shrunk by 0.1% (q-o-q, annualised) due to a sharp
contraction in government defence spending and
inventories. Economic expansion in EMEs
remained low compared to the recent past, but
surprised on the positive side in China. The
rebound in GDP growth in the last quarter of 2012
at 7.9% y-o-y suggests that the economy has
turned the corner. For the global economy a slow
pick-up in activity is predicted for this year, taking
place against headwinds stemming from fiscal
consolidation in many countries and low
confidence levels. Overall, global GDP (excluding
the EU) is forecast to expand around 4% in 2012
and 2013 respectively. In 2014, a moderate
acceleration to 4½% is expected.

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

World GDP growth lost momentum over the first
three quarters of 2012 and is expected to have
remained muted at the end of last year, with
indicators pointing to a trough in late 2012 for
some major economies. The global slowdown
affected advanced and emerging market economies
(EMEs) alike. According to preliminary data for
the third quarter of 2012, both advanced
economies and EMEs grew at the weakest year-onyear growth rate since the beginning of 2010. But
EMEs remain the main drivers of global economic
activity, accounting for more than ¾ of world
growth.

World trade mirrors global growth patterns …

Amid high volatility the growth rate of goods trade
in advanced economies continued to decrease over
the year and turned negative in November 2012,
whereas merchandise trade in EMEs rebounded
since October 2012 and is almost back to pre-crisis
levels. On balance, world trade started to rebound
in September (see Graph I.3). However, this
expansion is well below its long-term average of
6%. Against the background of a gradual
acceleration in global activity in 2013, global trade
is expected to pick up slowly. Projections for nonEU trade are for an increase of around 4½% in
2013 and around 6% in 2014.

9

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

respectively. Assumptions for other commodity
prices remain broadly unchanged from the autumn
forecast, though metal prices are expected to
recover in 2013.

3.

Recent survey data point to some further
improvement in growth perspectives for global
manufacturing. The JP Morgan Global PMI
Manufacturing Index (seasonally adjusted) edged
up in January, confirming the switch into
expansion at the end of last year, while the global
composite indexes remained above the expansion
threshold throughout the year 2012.

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN EUROPE

Since the summer, tensions in financial markets
have eased and market sentiment has improved on
the back of decisive policy measures. In particular,
sovereign-bond spreads have declined very
significantly, while benchmark yields have edged
upwards from previously very low levels (see
Graph I.4). Despite a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook and narrowing corporate profit
margins, European stock markets have rallied, in
particular the financial sector sub-segment.
Spreads of non-financial corporate bonds have
declined visibly, especially those for corporate
bonds with the best credit ratings (See also
box I.1).

… and inflation pressures are contained.

Despite some limited spikes in food prices,
inflation remains subdued on account of slow
growth, weak demand and still comparatively
benign commodity markets. Reflecting the difficult
global economic situation, inflation in most EMEs
is also falling. Core inflation rates are low or
converging to lower levels in most economies with
the notable exception of some EMEs including
Russia, South Africa and India. Monetary policy in
many advanced economies remains exceptionally
accommodative, and quantitative easing continues
in the US and Japan. Commodity prices decreased
towards the end of the year, after rebounding in
mid-2012. Brent oil prices dropped from their peak
of 125 USD/bbl in March to 109 USD/bbl in
December. Fears of a new food crisis did not
materialise, as prices of most cereals and soybeans
stabilised towards the end of the year. Prices of
non-food agricultural commodities, minerals and
metals were falling steeply throughout most of
2012.
Our assumptions for oil prices continue to indicate
a fall, but have been revised upwards with regard
to last autumn to reflect the stronger upward trend
since mid-January. On an annual basis, oil prices
(Brent) averaged 111.8 USD/bbl in 2012 and are
projected to rise to 113.7 USD/bbl in 2013 and
then moderate to 106.4 USD/bbl in 2014,

However, the financial market situation remains
fragile, and low yields on safe assets suggest that a
considerable degree of risk aversion persists.

procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and

the progress on recapitalising the banking system
and recent policy interventions improved larger
banks' liquidity situation and funding conditions,
notably their access to wholesale and retail funding
markets, (5) the recent improvement in funding
conditions has not been uniform. Cross-border
interbank flows are still largely constrained, and
the euro money market remains fragmented owing
to concerns about the intertwined sovereign and
counterparty credit risks. Thus, small euro-area
banks and particularly banks in vulnerable
Member States still depend to a large extent on
direct liquidity provision by the Eurosystem. As a
result, bank lending rates vary widely across
Member States.

credit standards in the fourth quarter of 2012
remained broadly unchanged for loans to nonfinancial corporations (see Graph I.6).

… reflected by weak bank lending to the
private sector ...

Bank lending to the private sector in the euro area
has shrunk further in December at an annual rate
of 0.8% (see Graph I.5).

However, credit standards for loans to households
tightened due to a widening of margins on riskier
loans. Surveyed banks also reported lower loan
demand by households and a pronounced net
decline in demand for loans to non-financial
corporations, reflecting the weakness in business
investment. Looking ahead, banks in the euro area
expect a similar degree of net tightening and a less
pronounced net decline in demand for corporate
loans, but a stronger net decline for loans for house
purchases. Banks expect funding conditions to
keep improving in the first quarter of 2013.

While lending to non-financial corporations

number of euro-area Member States, credit flows
are likely to remain muted in the near future.

The Commission's composite financing costs
indicator (CFCI), a broad measure of financing
costs that also takes into account capital-marketbased sources of financing (both debt and equity),
suggests a reduction in the divergence of financing
costs among euro-area Member States in the
second half of 2012. This has been mainly driven
by the falling costs of corporate bond financing.
The CFCI at the euro-area level indicates an easing
in the financing costs of NFCs since the summer of
2012, with the indicator hitting a record low in
November. By contrast, although average money
market interest rates in the euro area as a whole are
close to historical lows, bank financing costs
diverge significantly across Member States.

According to the ECB, 305 counterparties decided to
exercise an option to repay EUR 140.6 bn of funding
received through the first 3-year LTROs in late 2011 and
early 2012.

Moreover, access to finance seems to be a limiting
factor particularly for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SME) as recent surveys suggest. (6) As
a result, the funding capacity of the private sector
is considerably impaired in vulnerable Member
States, and this is weighing on investment growth
and hampering the necessary reallocation of
resources and thus the sectoral adjustment process.

THE EU ECONOMY

According to Eurostat's Flash estimate, the
recession in the euro-area economy deepened in
the fourth quarter of 2012, while the EU economy
slipped again into contraction. Compared to the
previous quarter, GDP shrunk by 0.5% and by
0.6% in the EU and the euro area respectively. In
the third quarter, the EU escaped a technical
recession of two consecutive quarters of declining

13

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

output largely thanks to exceptional factors in the
UK. (7)
A gradual stabilisation is expected for 2013 …

At the beginning of 2013, readings of sentiment
indicators suggest that both the EU and euro-area
economies are bottoming out in the first quarter. In
January, the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI)
and the PMI Composite Output Index increased for
the third consecutive month in both the EU and the
euro area. However, the ESI is still below its longterm average and the PMI remains in contraction
territory (see Graph I.7).
Based on the expectation that uncertainty will be
further dispelled and sentiment improve, output in
the EU and the euro-area economy is expected to
stabilise in the first half of this year and start
expanding gradually in mid-2013. However,
domestic demand continues to be held back by the
impact of external and internal adjustment, notably
deleveraging in the private and public sector.

However, the worse-than-expected outcome in the
final quarter of 2012, implying a more negative
carry-over effect, combined with the fact that the
real economy has not yet benefitted from the
substantial improvements in financial markets
means that real GDP in the euro area is set to
decline slightly in 2013, whereas GDP in the EU is
estimated to remain broadly stable. While the
weakness of domestic demand is projected to
extend well into 2013 in both areas and to support
growth only from the latter half of 2013, net
exports are likely to remain the main growth driver
throughout this year.
… followed by a modest expansion in 2014.

The underlying quarterly profile for 2013-14 is
broadly in line with the autumn forecast and GDP
developments are likely to be somewhat more
dynamic than the annual figures suggest (see
Graph I.8). For example, GDP in the fourth quarter
of this year is forecast to exceed the level of the
same period of last year by 1% in the EU, and by
¾% in the euro area.
(7)

In the third quarter, growth in the UK was boosted by
short-term factors, most notably the Olympic Games and
the bounce-back from an extra bank holiday in the second
quarter for the Queen's diamond jubilee.

Looking ahead to 2014, some of the headwinds
which are currently weighing on EU and euro-area
growth are set to dissipate. Higher consumer
confidence, rising real disposable incomes and
slowly improving labour market conditions
towards the end of the forecast horizon should help
raising household consumption, while the
projected normalisation of financing conditions for
the private sector in vulnerable countries is likely
to have a positive impact on investment demand.
Moreover, the initial effects of structural reforms
are expected to take hold in 2014. As a result,
domestic demand should take over from net
exports as the main engine of growth. Overall, real
GDP is projected to grow by around 1½% in the
EU and the euro area in 2014, broadly unchanged
compared to the autumn forecast.
Net exports set to provide lifeline to growth in
2013…

Net exports have been stabilising GDP growth in
2012 and are expected to support the economy
further in 2013. In January, the PMI component for

14

Economic developments at the aggregated level

new export orders in the EU manufacturing sector,
albeit still below the expansion threshold,
increased and reached a 18-month-high (see
Graph I.9). Similarly, the Commission quarterly
survey of the manufacturing industry indicates that
managers were more optimistic on the expected
export volumes for the first quarter of 2013.

cyclically-weak domestic demand in the EU and
import growth is thus expected to remain muted in
2013. But consumption levels in some Member
States are also likely to remain lower for structural
reasons as private households are forced to
gradually reduce their debt burden. After a decline
in 2012, import volumes in 2013 are set to grow by
1½% in the EU and by 1¼% in the euro area,
helped by the expected gradual strengthening in
domestic demand in the second half of this year
but also by the high import content of many export
goods. In 2014, imports are expected to expand by
around 4¾% in both areas. Compared to the
autumn forecast, projections are revised downward
in both forecast years in line with the more
subdued outlook for domestic demand.
With export growth exceeding import growth, net
external demand is expected to continue to
contribute positively to GDP growth over the
forecast horizon. However, the positive growth
contribution is predicted to decline gradually in
line with the projected recovery of imports.

Based on the achieved gains in competitiveness the
predicted gradual improvement in global activity
and trade should boost export growth in the course
of 2013. For the year as a whole, exports of goods
and services are set to grow by about 2½% in both
the EU and the euro area. In 2014, export growth is
forecast to accelerate to 5% in both areas, in line
with global demand developments.
By contrast, imports are still constrained by

…while structural factors are weighing on
domestic demand.

Dissipating uncertainty and the expected cyclical
upturn in the global economy is likely to bolster
sentiment and provide support to the domestic
economy. But the need for households, firms,
banks and sovereigns in several Member States to
strengthen their balance sheets and bring down
debt to sustainable levels is likely to constrain the

15

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

dynamics of domestic demand over the forecast
horizon. In particular, the substantial easing of
financial market tensions over the last months has
not yet translated into a significant improvement in
bank lending conditions to households and nonfinancial corporations in vulnerable countries.
These are major reasons why the recovery in the
EU and the euro area is likely to be delayed until
the second half of this year and why growth is
expected to become more broadly-based only in
2014.
Fiscal consolidation is necessary and should lift
economic prospects in the medium- and long-term,
but is expected to weigh on growth prospects in
the short-run. This is particularly true for those
countries where households and firms are
financially constrained and where the economy
operates well below its potential. However, the
impact of fiscal consolidation should be slightly
lower this year than in 2012 given the progress
made and conditional on the usual no-policychange assumption that takes into account the
information from 2013 budgets.

capital spending. On the other hand, crisis-related
factors such as substantial financing constraints in
some Member States and weak business sentiment
induced by high uncertainty deterred companies
from expanding business activity and point to
further shrinking investment at the end of 2012. (8)
Deleveraging
needs
among
non-financial
corporations with high corporate debt-to-GDP
ratios remain substantial in several Member States.
Apart from potential holding gains the shoring-up
of corporate balance sheets mainly occurs through
changes in net credit flows. This is reflected by the
increasing net lending position of the corporate
sector in some vulnerable countries (e.g. Spain,
Greece and Portugal). Deleveraging through
negative net credit flows is likely to have
detrimental effects on corporate investment, as
internal funds are mostly used for debt repayment
and not for investment projects. (9)
Four years after the Great recession private
investment is still below pre-crisis levels and the
aforementioned headwinds will in large part also

The decline in private fixed investment that set in

low capacity utilisation rates, but also meagre

There is evidence that a financial crisis-induced fall in
credit supply tend to amplify investment downturns, in
particular in vulnerable countries, see Buca, A. and
P. Vermeulen, "Corporate investment and bank-dependent
borrowers during the recent financial crisis", Paper
presented at the ECB workshop Analysing the role of credit
in the macroeconomy, 24 May 2012.
Some other Member States that are also facing high
corporate debt-to-GDP ratios are rather "growing out-ofdebt" as nominal GDP growth is driving the ratios down
(e.g. Belgium, Sweden or the United Kingdom).

Economic developments at the aggregated level

remain in place in 2013. (10) Accordingly, nearterm investment dynamics are likely to be
subdued, as suggested by the latest Commission
industrial investment survey.
… but equipment investment is expected to
recover in 2013 …

Investment in equipment continued contracting in
the third quarter of 2012 and the short-term
outlook remains weak (see Graph I.10). Surveys
point to a further fall in the final quarter of 2012
and the production of capital goods in the first two
months of the fourth quarter was on average 4%
lower than in the previous quarter. In January
2013, the European Commission’s industrial
confidence indicator was still well below its
historical average, while the manufacturing PMI
remained below the expansion threshold.

While weak capital expenditure in vulnerable
countries is mostly related to structural factors (11)
and adverse financing conditions, investment
dynamics in core countries appear to be restrained
by the unusual high degree of uncertainty over the
last quarters (see Box I.2).
As from the second half of 2013, investment in
equipment is expected to pick up in the EU and the

The investment-to-GDP ratio declined to 18% in the EU
and the euro area in the third quarter of 2012, compared to
a peak around 21% in the EU and 21.5% in the euro area at
the beginning of 2007. However, the 2007 ratio might to
some extent also been inflated by unsustainably high
residential investment.
The very weak investment environment in vulnerable
countries could also be related to the relatively low market
exit rates of non-viable firms. Even though corporate
insolvencies have markedly increased in vulnerable
countries in 2011, insolvency ratios are still particularly
low in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, see Creditreform,
Insolvencies in Europe 2011/12, February 2012.

euro-area economy as increasing confidence and
improved domestic and external demand prospects
are likely to increase capital spending. Moreover,
with diminishing uncertainty, the realisation of
investment projects that had been postponed, is
expected to benefit gross fixed capital
formation. (12)
… while ongoing housing market adjustment is
weighing on construction investment …

Investment in construction continued its decline in
the third quarter of 2012. The ongoing adjustment
in housing markets, as indicated by the new
Eurostat house price indicator, (13) continues to
impact on residential investment and leading
indicators such as building permits do not suggest
any stabilisation in the near future. In 2013,
construction investment is expected to decline
further in both the EU and the euro area. With the
expected bottoming-out of the downward housing
market adjustment in 2014, construction
investment is predicted to pick up again in both
areas. However, contractions will persist in
countries facing the strongest housing market
corrections, notably in Spain.
Overall, total investment is expected to recover as
from the second half of 2013 in both the EU and
euro area, led by non-construction investment.
With significant destocking by the third quarter of
2012, the contribution of inventories to growth is
expected to be close to zero in the next few
quarters. (14) Cuts in government investment are
likely to be substantial in 2013, but are predicted to
be markedly more moderate in 2014 under the nopolicy-change assumption. In 2013 as a whole,
gross fixed capital formation is set to contract
further by 1% in the EU and by 1¾% in the euro
area. In 2014, total investment is expected to
increase by 2¾% in the EU and by 2½% in the
euro area.

This prediction is based on the assumption that with
dissipating uncertainty the 'real option value of waiting'
will decrease, see e.g. Bernanke, B., "Irreversibility,
uncertainty, and cyclical investment", Quarterly Journal of
Economics, Vol. 98, No. 1, 1983, pp. 85-106.
Compared to the same period of the previous year, house
prices in the euro area declined by 2.5% in the third quarter
of 2012. In Spain, house prices plummeted by over 15%
which suggest that the price correction in the Spanish
housing market is still in full swing.
This view is corroborated by the results of Commission
surveys according to which inventories are considered to
be below their long-term average and are expected to be
decreasing.

… and consumption is constrained by low
income growth and deleveraging …

Private consumption has been declining for four
consecutive quarters up to the third quarter of 2012
as muted nominal wage growth and persistent
inflation squeezed households' real disposable
incomes. Short-term indicators suggest weak
prospects for private consumption also in the near
future. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the volume of
retail sales were down by 0.6% in the EU and by
0.8% in the euro area (see Graph I.11). Although
consumer confidence has recently improved, its

current level still remains below its long-term
average, suggesting subdued consumer spending in
the short term.
In 2012, household consumption is expected to
have contracted by 0.7% in the EU and by 1.2% in
the euro area. The scope for reducing the saving
rate and thus consumption smoothing is limited by
households' need to consolidate their balance
sheets, in particular in countries that experienced a
boom-and-bust cycle in the housing market.
Uncertainty stemming from the sovereign-debt
crisis and increasing unemployment fears are

21

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

likely to have led households to increase their
precautionary savings. (15)

External rebalancing is progressing …

The ongoing external adjustment in several
Member States amid a difficult economic and
financial environment will shape the recovery
across countries. Structural reforms and gains in
competitiveness are underpinning the adjustment
process in vulnerable Member States. Unit labour
costs in several deficit countries have been
declining, while higher wage growth starts to
affect intra-area price competitiveness and
supports domestic demand in surplus countries.
… and current-account balances are further
improving.

The expected deterioration of the labour market
situation and muted wage growth as well as
substantial household deleveraging and fiscal
consolidation is set to continue to weigh on
household consumption in 2013. In 2013 as a
whole, private consumption is forecast to fall
slightly in the EU and by ¾% in the euro area.
This represents a downward revision compared to
the autumn forecast, mainly due to the strongerthan-expected negative impact from the
deterioration of the labour market. A more
pronounced and longer-lasting contraction in
private consumption over the forecast horizon is
expected in vulnerable Member States where
households face deleveraging needs and adverse
credit conditions. By contrast, private consumption
growth should be more robust in other Member
States. As regards public consumption, it is
projected to fall marginally in 2013 in both areas.

As a result of the improved competiveness through
internal devaluation, but also owing to structural
shifts and cyclical weaknesses in domestic
demand, current account balances of vulnerable
Member States have further improved in 2012. (16)
This development is set to continue over the
forecast horizon. Considering the euro area and the
EU as a whole, the current account (in adjusted
terms) has shifted into a visible surplus in 2012 in
both areas (see Graph I.12).

… and to increase timidly on the back of
easing inflation.

Looking further ahead, the expected increase in
nominal disposable incomes and the further
moderation in HICP inflation will give some
respite to consumers' real purchasing-power. Thus,
private consumption expenditure is projected to
pick-up by around 1% in 2014 in both the EU and
the euro area. Public consumption growth is
forecast to start growing again by ¼% in the EU
and by ½% in the euro area based on the nopolicy-change assumption.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

The downturn has a tight grip on the labour
market …

The timid recovery in employment ground to a halt
in mid-2011 and job losses prevailed in 2012.
Labour market conditions in the EU have
worsened continuously, reflecting the deterioration
in the overall economic situation and the
heightened uncertainty since end-2011. (17)
Joblessness steadily increased, particularly among
young and low-skilled workers, and in the final
quarter of 2012, the unemployment rate hit new
historical records in the euro area (11.7%) and the
EU (10.7%). In line with weak economic activity,
headcount employment is set to have declined by
½% in the EU and by 1% in the euro area in 2012
(see Graph I.13).

In contrast to the 2008-09 recession, the scope for
adjusting working hours and the fiscal space for
supportive policy measures, notably short-time
working schemes, is very limited at the current
juncture. This is also reflected by Okun's law
estimates which indicate that unemployment is
now markedly more sensitive to GDP fluctuations.
It is noteworthy, however, that the net increase in
the number of unemployed in the EU and the euro
area has been mainly driven by rises in a few
countries where employment contracted sharply in
sectors that had been growing unsustainably fast
during the boom and thus also structural shifts play
a role. Unemployment divergences across Member
States have thus reached an unprecedented
magnitude.
… with a weak short-term outlook amid
slowing productivity growth …

(17)

See European Commission (DG ECFIN), Labour market
developments in Europe 2012, pp. 11-12. For an empirical
analysis of the propagation channels of policy uncertainty
to unemployment, see e.g. Abaidoo, R., "Policy
uncertainty,
macroeconomic
dynamics,
and
US
unemployment conditions", Journal of Applied Business
Research, Vol. 28, No. 5, September/October 2012,
pp. 777-790.

Output growth is expected to feed through to the
labour market only with a lag. The latest readings
of Commission surveys suggest a further
weakening of the labour market situation and
additional job losses in the near future (see
Graph I.14). In the EU, employment expectations
remain below their long-term averages in
construction and, albeit to a lesser extent, in
industry and services. Firms' looming staff
reductions are also mirrored by strong
unemployment fears among consumers. Overall,
employment in 2013 is projected to decrease by
½% in the EU and by ¾% in the euro area. The
unemployment rate is set to climb higher in both
areas and to remain at elevated levels over the
forecast horizon.
Annual growth in labour productivity slowed down
over the first half of 2012 and survey indicators
point to continuing weaknesses in the near future.

23

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

Overall, productivity started to deteriorate already
in 2010 and weakening labour productivity growth
suggests not only lower potential output and less
downward pressure on consumer prices, but also
only limited room for productivity-oriented wage
increases. (18)

common gauge of structural unemployment, has
increased substantially since 2008. Thus, in the
absence of successful sectorial adjustment, rising
unemployment duration together with the
worsening labour-market mismatch, risks to induce
a structurally higher unemployment rate in the
future. (20)
But the outlook provides a gleam of hope
towards 2014 …

The modest recovery in economic activity will
help stabilising the labour market situation towards
the end of the forecast horizon. Reduced
uncertainty and evidence of a firming recovery
will give rise to weak employment growth in 2014
between ¼% and ½%. Given a projected constant
rise in the labour force, the unemployment rate is
likely to stabilise at elevated levels in 2014, at
slightly above 12% in the euro area and at 11% in
the EU.
Since 2011, real wages have grown less than
productivity in most high-unemployment countries
faced with substantial internal and external
adjustment. Looking ahead, wage moderation is set
to continue in those countries, in line with recently
adopted reforms in the wage-setting system,
allowing for a gradual improvement in
competitiveness. By contrast, a stronger rise in unit
labour costs was observed in countries with
relatively low unemployment in 2012.
… and risk of hysteresis bodes ill for the
prospective recovery.

The duration of unemployment has been constantly
rising in the EU since mid-2009 and in the third
quarter of 2012, 45% of the unemployed were out
of job for more than 12 months. (19) Long-term
unemployment is associated with lower
employability of job seekers and a lower
sensitivity of the labour market to economic
upturns. One indication of this so-called hysteresis
effect is a worsening matching process in the
labour market, i.e. more vacancies tend to coexist
with a higher number of unemployed. According
to Commission estimates, the non-accelerating
wage rate of unemployment (NAWRU), a

… on the back of progressing restructuring in
vulnerable countries.

The labour market adjustment differs widely
across Member States and large growth
differentials over the forecast horizon will entail a
widening of those divergences across Member
States in 2013, when the highest unemployment
rates are expected in Spain and Greece (close to
27%), and the lowest in Austria, Luxembourg and
Germany (between 4½% and 5¾%). Major
improvements are only expected towards the end
of the forecast horizon, as the necessary
reallocation of resources from the non-tradable to
the tradable sector in vulnerable Member States is
assumed to take time. (21)
Looking ahead, employment expectations, albeit
still negative, are relatively more focused on
sectors like manufacturing which tend to have a
high export share. At the same time, hiring
intentions in core Member States are relatively
more centred on sectors of the domestic economy,
such as services and construction.
(20)

(21)
(18)

(19)

24

Regarding vulnerable Member States, low productivity
growth would imply that the necessary wage moderation
and gains in competitiveness had to be achieved via lower
nominal wages.
In eight EU Member States long-term unemployment was
above 50% in 2012.

See European Commission (DG ECFIN), Labour market
developments in Europe 2012, pp. 24-25.
However, the necessary reallocation of employment across
sectors had begun in some Member States in 2010. Even
though overall employment is still declining in vulnerable
countries, labour shedding has been relatively more
concentrated in the non-tradable sector (including
construction).

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Headline inflation is moderating…

Consumer-price inflation decreased in 2012 with
respect to the previous year in both the EU and the
euro area on the back of worsening economic
conditions, averaging 2.6% and 2.5% respectively
(see Graph I.15). But the easing of price pressures
was limited by changes in taxation in a number of
Member States, volatile oil prices (in particular in
euro terms) and rising food commodity prices in
the first half of 2012.

This reflects increases in indirect taxes and
administrative prices in several Member States
affecting both services and non-energy industrial
goods, but also the pass-through from past
exchange-rate depreciations and the previous hike
in food commodity prices. With the predicted
gradual reduction in the output gap over the
forecast horizon, the dampening cyclical impact on
price pressures is likely to fade. However, in line
with the more recent historical evidence, the
classic link between the output gap and inflation is
expected to remain rather loose.
With relatively moderate wage pressures …

…but core inflation is set to remain persistent.

Despite downward pressures stemming from the
amount of slack in the economy, core inflation (i.e.
HICP inflation excluding energy and unprocessed
food) has proved persistent. Though core inflation
was somewhat pushed down in the EU, from 2.3%
at the end of 2011 to 1.8% in December 2012 (and
from 1.9% to 1.6% respectively in the euro area) it
is projected to remain broadly stable over the
forecast horizon (see Graph I.16).

Amid
large
cross-country
divergences,
compensation per employee in the euro area rose at
a relatively moderate pace on average (1.8% y-o-y
in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 2.2%
on average in 2011). But the growth in unit labour
costs has accelerated in the course of 2012 and is
also likely to continue in the coming quarters given
the low productivity gains in a context of weak
economic growth. Yet, as the growth in
compensation per employee is lower than that of
negotiated wages since the second quarter of 2012,
some wage cost adjustment at the euro-area level
appears to be driven by a negative wage drift. (22)
… producer price inflation easing …

Annual industrial producer price inflation
(excluding construction) fell to around 2% in the
EU and the euro area towards end-2012 on account
of substantially lower energy price inflation.
According to survey indicators of price
developments (both PMI and ESI components),
inflation pressures from the producer side seem to
be restrained at the beginning of 2013, given the
weakness in economic conditions and the
assumptions for commodity-price developments
(see Graph I.17).
(22)

See ECB, Monthly Bulletin, January 2013, pp. 34-36.

25

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

Consolidation in public finances progressing …

Despite a more negative cyclical contribution from
a weaker-than-expected growth outlook, the
consolidation of public finances is set to continue
over the forecast horizon. Compared with the
autumn 2012 forecast, the pace of budgetary
adjustment remains broadly unchanged in both the
euro area and the EU (see Graph I.18). (23)

… and well-anchored inflation expectations …

In the course of 2012, consumers' inflation
expectations have reflected inter alia the volatility
in commodity markets, but have decreased
somewhat to levels last observed before the
summer of 2012. Furthermore, the ECB's survey of
professional forecasters suggest stable long-run
inflation expectations around 2.0% and marketbased inflation expectations point to inflation rates
significantly below (for inflation-linked bonds) or
just around (for inflation swaps) 2%. Although the
marked-based indicators should be interpreted with
caution as long as financial market conditions have
not fully normalised, they are indicative of
inflation expectations being well-anchored at the
current juncture.

Due to the implementation of sizeable fiscal
adjustment programmes in several Member States,
the headline deficit in 2012 is expected to have
fallen by close to ¾ pp. to 3.5% of GDP in the
euro area and to 3.8% in the EU. Irrespective of
the lower growth expectations, the general
government deficit is projected to shrink in 2013 to
2.8% of GDP in the euro area and to 3.4% in the
EU, mainly due to fiscal consolidation measures
included in 2013 budgets.

… the outlook points to firmly decreasing
inflation.

Looking ahead, underlying price pressures are
likely to remain subdued given the modest growth
outlook, in particular weak domestic demand in
peripheral economies, and well-anchored inflation
expectations. Average annual HICP inflation in
2013 is predicted to ease further on the back of
base effects from past increases in commodity
prices and indirect taxes in many Member States.
Under the no-policy-change assumption (i.e.
excluding fiscal measures that are not known or
sufficiently specified at the cut-off date that might
have an impact on headline inflation via e.g. tax
rises), the average HICP inflation in 2014 in the
EU and euro area is set to decrease further to 1.7%
and 1.5% respectively.

26

With the projected recovery gaining momentum in
2014, headline deficits are expected to decrease
further. However, owing to the customary nopolicy-change assumption the predicted declines to
2.7% of GDP in the euro area and to 3.1% in the
EU are rather marginal. Besides some minor
exceptions, the projected fall in the aggregate
general government deficit over the forecast
horizon is also broad based at the Member-State
level.
(23)

With regard to EU budgetary surveillance, only Bulgaria,
Germany, Estonia, Luxemburg, Malta, Finland and Sweden
are currently not subject to the Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP).

Economic developments at the aggregated level

… with improvements in budget balances
increasingly expenditure-based.

In both the EU and euro area, reductions in
headline budget deficits in 2012 are driven by
improvements on the revenue side. The main
contributors to the rise in general government
revenues are higher taxes on income and wealth
and, to a lesser extent, increased indirect taxes in
in a number of Member States. As a result, in both
areas the revenue-to-GDP ratio is forecast to rise
by around ¾ pp. in 2012 and increase further in
2013 when it is predicted to reach a temporary
peak of 46.8% and 45.7% in the euro area and the
EU respectively. While revenues are projected to
decline at the end of the forecast horizon,
reductions in government spending are likely to
support the consolidation in both 2013 and 2014.
Cuts in discretionary spending concentrate on
wages and salaries, public investment and
intermediate consumption, whereas expenditure on
social transfers is forecast to increase slightly.
Budgetary positions in
expected to improve …

structural

Overall, gross public debt in the euro area is
expected to exceed 90% of GDP in 2012 and is
projected to rise further in 2013 and, albeit only
marginally, in 2014. In the EU as a whole, the
debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase, albeit at a
decreasing rate, over the forecast horizon and to
exceed 90% of GDP in 2014.

terms

The budgetary position is expected to improve, as
measured by the change in the structural budget
balance, i.e. the general government balance
corrected for cyclical factors and one-offs and
other temporary measures. As a percentage of
GDP, the structural balance is set to improve in
2012 by 1½ pps. in the euro area and by ¾ pp. in
the EU and in 2013 by ¾ pp. in both areas. In
2014, a slight deterioration in the euro area is
forecast owing to the no-policy-change
assumption.
Public debt in the euro area expected to
stabilise in 2014.

Despite the projected improvements in the
headline budget balance over the forecast horizon
government debt ratios for the years 2012 and
2013 in the euro area and the EU are projected to
be slightly higher than expected in the autumn (see
Table I.5).
The 2012 upward revision is mainly linked to a
more negative impact of the primary balance and
the stock-flow adjustment, (24) while in 2013 the
(24)

additional deterioration in public debt ratios is
driven by the less positive contribution of the
primary balance and the so-called snowball effect,
in particular by the more negative cyclical
contribution of the real GDP component. In 2014,
a less positive contribution of the primary balance
to the reduction of the debt ratios is only partially
offset by a lower-than-expected impact of interest
expenditure and the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to increase further.

The stock-flow adjustment includes elements that affect
directly government debt without passing through the
deficit as for instance differences in cash and accrual
accounting, accumulation of financial assets and valuation
and other residual effects.

5.

RISKS

Decisive policy actions have managed to reduce
tail risks and market confidence has improved. But
even though the risk balance appears more
favourable now, the risks to the growth outlook
continue to be tilted to the downside with the most
prominent risks related to policy slippage.
Despite diminished tail risks, a re-escalation of the
sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area remains a
downside risk, but can be contained further by
staying the course on policy decisions and by the
effective implementation of policies. In the context
of a fragile European financial system and weak
short-term growth prospects, renewed financial
turmoil would largely affect (still low) confidence,
financing conditions, and domestic demand. In
particular, a resurgence of policy uncertainty from
waning support for necessary fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms could jeopardise internal

27

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2013

and external adjustment in vulnerable countries
and the prospective EU-wide recovery.
In light of an uncertain growth environment, and
also related to the no-policy-change assumption,
fiscal policy measures could go beyond those
already included in the central scenario. Although
the baseline forecast incorporates a stronger
reaction of unemployment to the GDP contraction
than in previous years, there is a risk that labour
shedding could accelerate, with a negative impact
on confidence and real incomes.

progressing faster and more smoothly than
expected, thus reducing the scale and length of
adjustment recessions in several Member States. In
the US, sustainable compromise on spending cuts
could prove less harmful for growth than
previously believed. In emerging market
economies, the recovery from the soft patch in
2012, possibly supported by additional policy
easing and some structural measures to rebalance
growth, could be faster and stronger than expected.
The relation of upside and downside risks for GDP
growth are summarised by a fan chart (see
Graph I.19). (25)

Significant downside risks also stem from the
external environment. Political gridlock in the US
is still threatening to result in much sharper fiscal
retrenchment in the US by the beginning of March.
Nevertheless, sustainable medium-term fiscal
consolidation is necessary in the US but also in
Japan. The impact of the recent euro appreciation
on euro-area exports might be larger than usual in
the context of firms' already compressed profit
margins.
Additionally, a protracted slowdown in advanced
economies and notably in the euro area would have
immediate repercussions for emerging markets via
the trade channel and vice versa. In particular, a
renewed growth slowdown in BRICS countries
might weigh on the outlook for other emerging
markets and, eventually, on EU export prospects.
Finally, an escalation of geopolitical tensions
could result in surging oil prices.
Upside risks relate to confidence building up more
strongly from progress on the policy side resulting
e.g. in establishing a detailed framework for a
banking union and closer fiscal cooperation which
might further reduce policy uncertainty and benefit
sentiment. Structural reforms in vulnerable
countries could bear fruit earlier and the linked
adjustment process could accordingly be

Risks to the inflation outlook are seen as broadly
balanced. A deeper and more protracted downturn
in the EU and the euro area or the soft patch of the
global economy extended over a longer period
could impact on domestic and external demand.
Thus, consumer price inflation could be contained
further together with more flexible wages and
product prices resulting from product and labour
market reforms. These downside risks are
counterbalanced by possibly further increases in
indirect taxes (and administrative prices) and
upward price pressures on commodity markets.
(25)

The fan chart is constructed on the basis of the different
probabilities associated with the different upside and
downside risks over the forecast horizon.

1. BELGIUM
Sluggish growth and ongoing fiscal consolidation
Timid export-led recovery in sight

After benefiting from a momentary revival in the
first quarter of 2012, activity declined abruptly
again in the second quarter before stabilising in the
second half of the year. Factors such as the
deceleration in global activity, tougher financial
conditions, fiscal consolidation and persistent
uncertainty are projected to contribute to the
overall GDP contraction of 0.2% in 2012.

Stepped-up uncertainty about economic prospects,
tightened credit conditions and a capacity
utilisation below its long-term average resulted in
negative private investment in 2012. Investment is
forecast to recover from the end of 2013 onwards,
thanks to partially restored confidence in the
business
sector
and
improved
demand
expectations. Housing investment, affected by the
decrease in disposable income, is not projected to
turn positive until 2014. Public investment, strong
in the run-up to the 2012 local elections is
expected to drop by 6.7% in 2013 before turning
positive again.
Against this background, domestic demand is not
likely to contribute to growth this year but is
expected to add 1.5 pps. in 2014. This will drive
up imports, resulting in a zero contribution by net
exports to GDP growth. This masks somehow
Belgium's competitiveness problems, as exports
will grow less than exports markets over the
forecast horizon.

Activity is expected to start expanding again as of
the second quarter of 2013. Annual GDP growth
should then turn positive in 2013, though driven
only by net exports. Specifically, due to the high
degree of openness of the economy, Belgium is
expected to take advantage to a certain extent of
the recovery of world trade. In 2014, due to more
dynamic private consumption, which will also
push imports up, domestic demand is expected to
become the sole contributor to growth with GDP
expanding by 1.5%.
Specifically, private consumption is forecast to
increase only modestly in 2013, given sluggish
employment, associated weak disposable income
growth and a projected decrease of the saving rate
under a still uncertain economic environment.
Besides, although Belgium benefits from lower
spreads, reflecting a regain in confidence from
financial markets, the fragile financial sector is
tightening its credit conditions to the private
sector, further deterring domestic demand.
Confidence is expected to strengthen next year as
the labour market stabilises and, concomitantly,
disposable income increases.

34

Risks are balanced. On the one hand, further
budgetary consolidation measures and a further
tightening of credit conditions may weigh more on
domestic demand. On the other hand, a stronger
than assumed global growth and a faster recovery
of confidence could lead to increased dynamism
during the recovery phase.
Delayed
rise
in
unemployment,
inflationary pressure eases

while

Unemployment remained broadly stable during
2012 at 7.3%. Though the 2013-14 freeze in real
wages announced in recent months should help to
limit a further weakening of cost-competitiveness
and hence non-cyclical job losses, the weak
economic climate will drive up the ratio to 7.7% in
2013, consistent with the observed rise in the
number of company closures. The unemployment
rate is projected to remain stable in 2014.
On the back of falling energy prices, inflationary
pressures are set to slow down from 2.6% in 2012
to 1.6% in 2013. The Belgian economy being
highly energy intensive, this evolution reflects the
assumed oil price decrease and government
measures to enhance competition on the domestic
gas and electricity markets. Nominal wage growth
should see a comparable slowdown this year due to

recent measures aiming at containing nominal
wage dynamics.

since the autumn forecast drives up the 2013
deficit projections again, to 3% of GDP.

Budget balance projected to wobble around
the 3% of GDP threshold

In 2014, the deficit is expected to rise to 3.2% of
GDP, despite the better growth outlook. This is
partially due to the large recourse to one-off
measures, counting for about ½% of GDP in 2012
and ¼% of GDP in 2013. The structural budget
balance is estimated to have improved by 0.7 pp.
of GDP in 2012. In 2013 a further improvement in
structural terms of 0.5 pp. is expected before a new
deterioration in 2014, due to the rising trend of a
number of expenditure categories, assuming no
policy change.

The general government deficit is estimated to
have reached 3.0% of GDP in 2012, excluding the
potential deficit impact of the recapitalisation of
Dexia. (26) After the cut-off date of the autumn
forecast, the federal government had frozen around
0.1% of GDP of expenditure to address the
budgetary impact of the economic slowdown, but
this could not prevent Belgium from missing its
own deficit target of 2.8% of GDP. Towards the
year-end, revenues slowed down more than
anticipated, while small spending overruns
occurred in the social security.
Since the autumn forecast, the federal government
agreed on a draft 2013 budget, which contains
0.8% of GDP of consolidation measures. However,
the downward revision of growth and inflation
(26)

The general government debt is estimated to have
increased from 97.8% in 2011 to 99.8% of GDP in
2012. The impact of the recapitalisation of Dexia
on the debt (0.8% of GDP) has been offset by the
reimbursement of a loan by KBC. Under the
current forecast, the debt ratio continues to rise in
2013 before stabilising at around 101% of GDP in
2014. Large contingent liabilities (around 15% of
GDP) stemming from guarantees given to financial

2. BULGARIA
Slow recovery ahead
Sluggish growth in 2012

Preliminary GDP data published for the first three
quarters of 2012 indicates a deceleration of growth
to below 1% in annual terms, down from 1.7%
recorded in 2011. While the initial phase of the
economic recovery over 2010-11 was driven by
exports, whereas domestic demand contracted, this
pattern appears to have changed in 2012. Domestic
demand has taken over as the main growth driver,
while net exports turned negative. A recovery in
private consumption was the main driver of
growth, along with a positive contribution from
inventories. After three years of strong contraction,
investment activity has also stabilised over 2012,
supported mainly by public projects and some
recovery in FDI, especially in the energy sector.
Domestic demand driving growth

GDP growth is projected to recover gradually to
1.4% in 2013 and further to 2% in 2014. The
recent growth pattern is forecast to continue, with
domestic demand leading the recovery. At the
same time, net exports are expected to continue
contributing negatively to growth in 2013 and, to a
lesser extent, in 2014. While exports are forecast to
benefit from the expected gradual recovery in the
EU markets over 2013-2014, imports are set to
grow even faster due to the revival of household
consumption and investments. The current account
is therefore forecast to slide into a deficit of 2% of
GDP by 2014.
Domestic demand is expected to be supported by a
stable overall domestic economic environment and
relatively strong public finances upholding
consumer confidence. Also, the financial sector is
expected to contribute positively to growth. Recent
monthly data from the banking sector suggest the
continuation of a downward trend in both deposit
and lending interest rates, which is expected to
lead to a modest growth in credit and to support
investment and consumption.
Household consumption is forecast to expand
further in 2013-14, assuming a continuous increase
in real incomes and a gradual recovery in
household confidence. Investment would be
initially driven by public sector projects funded by
the EU. Private sector investment is seen to pick
up gradually from the current relatively low post-

36

crisis levels, in line with the economic recovery
and easing financing conditions.

Employment growth (y-o-y%)

Risks related to this baseline scenario seem
broadly balanced. The most significant downside
risk is related to the current positive momentum in
household consumption, which could reverse given
that the Bulgarian labour market and household
sentiment is still fragile, interlinked with euro-area
turbulence. As an upside risk, exports could
develop more favourably if the past trend of gains
in global market shares resumes.
Structural mismatches in the labour market

Despite the modest GDP growth, the labour market
has remained weak with employment down by
over 4% in 2011 and by almost 2% in 2012.
Unemployment has climbed to above 12% of the
labour force in 2012. However, monthly and
quarterly data indicates that these adverse
employment and unemployment trends slowed
towards the end of 2012.
Job cuts were related to a structural adjustment
following the economic boom-bust cycle.
Employment declined particularly among the lowskilled employees, in poorer regions and in the
construction-related sectors. Skill and geographical
mismatches as well as long-term unemployment
have risen, which indicates that unemployment has
become increasingly structural. This would slow a
labour market rebound even when the economy
picks up. The labour market is therefore forecast to
turn to an only sluggish recovery over 2013-2014.

Member States, Bulgaria

While employment trends have been weak, growth
in wages and unit labour costs has been relatively
strong and is expected to remain rapid. Wages are
being pushed up by several factors, notably by
wage convergence pressures from the lowest levels
in the EU and by labour market mismatches.

to 1% of GDP in 2012. The improvement was
driven by exceptionally strong VAT revenues,
which were boosted by strong domestic demand,
imports and measures to improve tax compliance.
The fiscal deficit is set to weaken slightly to 1.3%
in 2013, but to revert back to 1% of GDP in 2014.
Although favourable revenue trends are expected
to continue in 2013, expenditure is expected to
increase even faster in that year. The most notable
expenditure increases in the 2013 budget relate to
raising pensions by 9.3% as of 1 April 2013, some
increases in other social expenditure, wages of
some specific professions and EU structural funds
expenditure. Overall, the budget implies a slightly
expansionary fiscal stance in 2013 and its reversal
in 2014. The structural deficit is estimated to stay
at around ½% of GDP over the forecast years.
Given the scheduled repayment of one large
government bond, general government gross debt
is forecast to decline in 2013 from the previous
year and settle at 17.3% of GDP in 2014.

Inflation to level off after a peak in Q3-2012

HICP inflation peaked in the third quarter of 2012
at 3% y-o-y, reflecting hikes in global energy, food
and some administrative prices. Nevertheless, core
inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food
prices) has remained more moderate at slightly
above 1% y-o-y. Assuming a stabilisation of global
energy and food prices going forward, headline
HICP inflation is expected to level off at 2.6% in
2013 and 2.7% in 2014. Still, core inflation is
projected to pick up given the rise in unit labour
costs, the steady recovery in household demand
and the ongoing convergence of domestic prices
towards EU averages.
Fiscal position to stay strong

The general government fiscal deficit is forecast to
have improved markedly from 2% of GDP in 2011

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
Anaemic consumption and a fragile labour market
Stagnation in 2013 followed by slow recovery

therefore expected to decrease again in 2013 and to
only edge upwards again in 2014.

The Czech economy posted negative GDP growth
in 2012, having continued to shrink for four
consecutive quarters. The main driver of the
decline was domestic demand, which was hit by
several negative factors. Hikes in energy and food
prices amidst ongoing fiscal consolidation and
weak wage growth took the biggest toll on
household consumption. The outlook for 2013 is
one of stagnation as the domestic demand is
projected to remain weak, while external demand
is set to pick up and shore up output only in the
second half of the year.

In view of the spare production capacities and
falling new orders in industry, fixed capital
formation is also expected to stagnate in 2013.
Construction investment is, however, forecast to
contract further, as short-term indicators on
construction activity do not suggest a quick
recovery and favourable financing conditions are
mostly used to refinance existing mortgages. The
expected recovery in both domestic and foreign
demand should help lift investment in 2014.
Trade surplus continues to rise

Export growth eased in recent quarters. However,
as demand from the non-European economies is
still holding up, Czech exports should overcome
the soft short-term spell relatively quickly and pick
up again in 2014, in line with the expected
recovery in international trade. Stagnant demand is
projected to weigh on imports and to give rise to a
record trade surplus of 4.1% of GDP in 2013. The
lower net borrowing needs of the government and
of households are expected to narrow the external
financing gap to close to 1% of GDP.
Price and wage growth remains subdued
Lower job security weighs on spending

Throughout 2012, household consumption
experienced losses as the saving rate rebounded to
a level near 11%. This development is consistent
with falling real disposable income and
expectations of further fiscal tightening. It is,
however, somewhat surprising, because it took
place against a background of growing domestic
employment and only a moderate rise in the
unemployment rate. However, this labour market
performance masks a persistent shift of labour
from regular employment to self-employment as
well as cuts in hours worked. Households are
therefore under pressure not only from weak
income growth but also from lower job security,
with a clear impact on confidence. The saving rate
is projected to rise further over the forecast horizon
also on account of the introduction of a new
funded pension pillar in 2013. Consumption is

38

Consumer prices are projected to grow by 2.1% in
2013. The January 2013 increases of VAT rates
and of other excise taxes are estimated to account
for 1.1 pps. of this rise. By contrast, energy and
food inflation are expected to ease off in the first
half of 2013 and overall inflation should remain
subdued over the forecast horizon in the absence of
near-term demand pressures.
Nominal wage growth slowed in 2012, in view of
the lower labour demand, and it is expected to
remain moderate also in 2013. Despite that,
competitiveness, measured by the unit labour
costs, deteriorated in 2012 as employers have so
far tended to hoard labour in the current
slowdown. The growth in unit labour costs is
projected to diminish by 2014.
Risks to this outlook are still tilted to the
downside. Should the recovery be delayed and
sentiments change, unemployment could rise by

Member States, The Czech Republic

more than expected, further weakening real
disposable income.
Persistent general government deficit

After the sizeable reduction achieved in 2011, the
headline general government deficit is expected to
increase to 5.2% of GDP in 2012. This reflects the
combined impact of two one-off operations, as
well as revenue shortfalls. The adoption of the
long-pending law on financial compensations to
churches led to a one-off increase in the deficit by
1.5 pps. of GDP in 2012.(27) Irregularities in the
management of EU funds resulted in financial
corrections, with a one-off deficit-increasing
impact of 0.3 pp. of GDP. The data for 2012
suggest a continued reduction in public investment
and intermediate consumption, but stronger growth
of public sector wages.
The general government balance is projected to
improve to -3.1% of GDP in 2013 on the back of
new consolidation measures (1.4 pps. of GDP),
spread equally on the revenue and expenditure
side. The deficit-increasing impact of the launch of
(27)

The forecast assumes that the impact of financial
compensations to churches will be recorded in 2012, not in
any way prejudging the final Eurostat ruling on its
recording.

the fully-funded pension pillar in 2013 was revised
down from 0.2 pp. of GDP to 0.1 pp. due to lowerthan-expected participation in the new pillar at the
beginning of the year. After posting a strong
decline in previous years, public investment in
value terms is projected to stagnate while
government consumption slowly picks up. The
structural deficit is projected to decline from 2.4%
in 2012 to 2.2% of GDP in 2013.
In 2014, the general government balance is
forecast to remain largely unchanged. Despite
planned across-the-board cuts at the central level
of 0.3% of GDP, public consumption and
investment are expected to increase moderately.
Revenues are expected to benefit from stronger
activity and from further hikes in excise duties.
Interest expenditure is projected to increase due to
the rising debt-to-GDP ratio, which is forecast to
be 49.5% of GDP in 2014. The structural deficit
would reach 2.1% of GDP in 2014.
The fiscal forecast is subject to risks related to a
higher-than-expected participation in the fullyfunded pension pillar. Larger-than-planned deficits
at the regional level and failure to fully implement
planned expenditure cuts could also weigh on the
budgetary outcome.

39

4. DENMARK
Gradually gaining traction
Economy lost momentum in 2012

Real GDP is estimated to have declined by 0.4% in
2012, implying a significant downward correction
by about 1 pp. compared with the autumn 2012
forecast. The main reason is a substantial statistical
downward revision of growth in the first semester
and an unanticipated drop in export activity in the
second semester as a result of the rapid worsening
of the external economic environment. For the year
as a whole, exports of goods and services are
estimated to have grown by 1.5%, in line with the
pace of external demand. Private consumption
expenditure was dragged down by subdued
consumer confidence and the deleveraging
pressure on highly indebted households. Against
this background, government initiatives to boost
household spending, such as the pay-out of
voluntary early retirement pension (VERP)
contributions, had only a limited impact on
demand and increased household savings instead.
Private consumption is thus estimated to have
increased by only by 0.6% in 2012. Domestic
demand was seemingly also dented by a negative
inventory effect as companies started selling off
stocks accumulated in 2010-11. The subdued
economic activity took its toll on the labour
market, with employment estimated to have fallen
by 0.6% and the average annual unemployment
rate peaking at 7.7%, which is high by historical
standards.

Private consumption is forecast to accelerate in the
course of 2013. Its dynamics will be determined by
two countervailing forces: low interest rates and
policy measures aimed at increasing disposable
income should support private consumption while
continued deleveraging needs and the past house
price correction suggest strong savings incentives.
These forces are expected to have a neutral net
effect on the household saving rate and private
consumption expenditure is projected to increase
by around 1% this year with growth accelerating to
some 2% in 2014. Net exports will continue to
subtract from growth in 2013 but are expected to
provide a positive contribution in 2014, as export
growth is catching up with import growth on the
back of strengthening external demand and
improvements in price competitiveness.

Recovery in 2013 to be supported by policy
measures

Economic growth is forecast to reach around 1% in
2013 and to pick up further to 1¾% in 2014. The
economy is expected to gain momentum in 2013
on the back of economic policy measures and an
expected recovery of external demand, before
entering a more self-sustained growth path in
2014. In particular, machinery and equipment
investment is projected to receive a temporary
boost from the 'investment window' tax breaks
introduced last year, but also from sustained low
interest rates. In contrast, construction activity is
set to remain weak, reflecting subdued house price
developments. As a result, gross fixed capital
formation is forecast to increase by 4½% in 2013,
but slow down again in 2014.

40

Price competitiveness set to further improve

HICP inflation is set to ease this year following
excise tax cuts. This together with a subdued
recovery of the labour market is expected to keep
wage growth contained. An expected average
annual productivity growth of about 1¼% should
limit unit-labour-costs increases over the forecast
horizon and support the further improvement in
external price competitiveness. This should
contribute to stabilising the external balance of
goods and services, which have come down
somewhat from its peak in 2010. However, as a
result of solid primary income surpluses thanks to
a strong net foreign asset position, the current
account is expected to maintain solid surpluses.

Member States, Denmark

Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are tilted to
the downside. Policies aimed at boosting
household consumption have so far shown muted
results and companies may not take advantage of
the 'investment window' tax breaks if domestic
demand remains sluggish and the recovery of the
external demand turns out to be weaker than
expected. On the positive side, through its tight
inter-linkages with the euro area Denmark could
benefit from improvements in sentiment in the
economies of the single currency.
Fiscal policy resisting pressures

The general government deficit is estimated to
have widened to 4% of GDP in 2012, due in
particular to the higher-than-expected one-off payout of VERP contributions. Also unemployment
benefits have turned higher than expected because
of stronger rise in the number of jobless. At the
same time, municipalities cut back public
consumption by more than expected, as a result of
the introduction of sanctions in case of breach of
the agreed expenditure ceilings.

The general government deficit is expected to
decrease again this year to 2.7% and increase
moderately in 2014 to 2.8%. The slight worsening
of the budgetary outlook compared with the
autumn forecast is due to lower projected
economic growth and its impact on tax revenues.
This projection is subject to upside risks, in
particular in 2013, related to revenues from the tax
on capital pension schemes.
The structural balance is projected to deteriorate
from a surplus of ¼% of GDP in 2012 to deficits
of the same size in 2013 and of about ½% in 2014.
However, the structural balance includes very
volatile revenue items such as the receipts from
North Sea oil and the pension yield tax. Net of
these items, the structural balance is projected to
gradually improve over the forecast horizon with
an average annual fiscal effort of 0.5% of GDP
from 2011 up until 2013.
Government debt is projected to rise at a relatively
low level and stay below 50% of GDP over the
entire forecast horizon.

5. GERMANY
Gradual recovery following a temporary setback
Delayed expansion of economic activity

The economic slowdown intensified at the end of
the last year. According to the official flash
estimate, GDP contracted by 0.6% q-o-q
(seasonally and working-day adjusted) in the
fourth quarter of 2012 following a moderate
expansion of 0.2% in the third quarter. In 2012 as a
whole, real GDP increased by 0.7%, 0.1 pp. less
than projected in the autumn forecast.

out in the course of this year. Import growth
should outperform export growth in 2013 and
2014, with the net effect of a narrowing of the
current-account surplus, due to the demand arising
from the high import content of revived equipment
investments and exports, solid private consumption
and buoyant housing investment.

Economic activity appears to have troughed,
although adverse effects from exceptional factors
like weather conditions cannot be ruled out. The
assessment by firms of the current business
situation has remained virtually stable for three
months and the simultaneous significant
improvement of business expectations points
towards a recovery in the near future. The return of
confidence is supported by an increase in industrial
orders from abroad in the final quarter of 2012,
which is reflected in export expectations having
returned to positive levels.
The sound fundamentals of the German economy,
including in particular the robust labour market
and strong competitiveness, together with an
improving external environment, should enable
economic activity to regain momentum in the
course of this year. However, the carry-over effect
of weaker-than-expected GDP growth in the
second half of 2012 weighs on full-year growth in
2013, which is projected to be 0.5%, hence 0.3 pp.
lower than predicted by the autumn forecast. GDP
growth is forecast to pick up to 2.0% in 2014.
Reaccelerating trade

domestic demand for investment goods. Although
capacity utilisation in manufacturing has improved
recently, the bias in investment motives towards

42

Employment is projected to expand a little over the
forecast horizon, although its increase exceeded
output gains in 2012. The unemployment rate is
expected to rise slightly and temporarily due to
growing labour supply. Hours worked per
employee were reduced in 2012 in order to avoid
layoffs of qualified staff during the recent
economic slowdown. Together with a reduction in
the pension contribution rate, this is expected to
contain the increase in compensation per employee
below the rise in agreed wages this year. Hours
worked should gradually recover, resulting in an
accelerated increase in compensation per employee
in 2014. Rising incomes and low interest rates
should underpin robust private consumption and
the scope for the household saving rate to continue
its downward trend.
While higher labour costs should gradually be
passed on to consumers, the assumed decline in
commodity prices tends to lower price pressures.
The impact on consumer prices of the increase in
the surcharge on electricity prices for feeding-in
renewable energy is expected to be broadly offset
by the abolition of the quarterly fee to be paid by
patients for medical treatments. Overall, inflation
is projected to decline further to 1.8% in 2013 and
1.7% in 2014.

Member States, Germany

Structural budget balance at the medium-term
objective and a declining debt ratio

According to the first official estimate, the general
government budget balance improved from a
deficit of 0.8% of GDP in 2011 to a slight surplus
of 0.1% of GDP in 2012. This improvement
resulted in particular from still-buoyant tax
revenues and moderate welfare spending thanks to
marked employment growth and wage increases,
although tax revenues decelerated significantly
towards the end of the year. The phase-out of the
remaining stimulus measures and lower interest
payments should also have contributed to the
improvement. Given the weaker growth outlook
for this year, the deceleration of tax revenues can
be expected to continue, in particular with respect
to profit-related taxes. The reduction in the pension
contribution rate by 0.7 pp., the abolition of the
quarterly fee for medical treatments and the
increase in the minimum income tax allowance
will also lower revenues, while the agreed and
upcoming wage settlements in the public sector are
expected to increase expenditure. Overall, the
general government budget is forecast to turn into
a slight deficit of 0.2% of GDP in 2013 and to be

balanced once again in 2014. With a structural
budget surplus of about ½% of GDP in 2012,
which is projected to broadly stabilise over the
forecast horizon, Germany is expected to have met
its medium-term budgetary objective.
Gross debt increased in 2012 mainly as a result of
the euro-area stabilisation measures and another
transfer of impaired assets in the context of the
winding-up of the former Landesbank WestLB.
The denominator effect of GDP growth is expected
to lower the gross debt ratio in the following years.

6. ESTONIA
Growing strongly, in tune with the other Baltic States
GDP growth is becoming more balanced…

Sound fiscal policy combined with remarkable
adjustment capacity of the economy has supported
Estonia’s resilience to the sovereign-debt crisis.
Estonia’s 3.2% economic growth in 2012 was
supported by robust domestic demand and
moderate export growth. In 2013, the forecast
GDP growth of 3% is expected to be more
balanced and should continue to converge to its
long-term average trend, reaching 4% in 2014.
Risks to the forecast appear broadly balanced and
mainly related to the external sector.
... as export growth regains momentum…

Export growth slowed down last year, while
industrial production volumes stabilised. This
largely reflects a lower growth in manufacturing,
and lower demand, notably for oil-shale energy
production. As employment continued to grow,
this fed into a moderate increase in unit labour
costs. Despite the ongoing economic slowdown of
Estonia's main trading partners, the manufacturing
and exports of electronic products regained
momentum in the course of last year. As
productivity growth reverted to positive values in
manufacturing, it has broadly equalled wage
growth for the country as a whole since spring
2012. In the foreseeable future, the relatively good
economic performance of Russia, and Russia's
accession to the WTO are expected to have a
positive effect on Estonia’s foreign trade. Based on
a progressive recovery of Estonia's main trading
partners from mid-2013, export growth is expected
to continue supporting GDP, with a strong trade
surplus in services more than offsetting a reducing
trade deficit in goods.
... and domestic demand moderates…

Domestic demand was robust in 2012, supported
by a favourable labour market situation and strong
fixed investment. Investment growth is forecast to
slow down from 23.3% in 2012 to 2.6% this year.
The major reason for this slowdown is the
contraction in public investment as the majority of
projects financed through the revenue from the
sale of excess greenhouse gas emission certificates
will end and that EU co-funded projects have been
completed. In 2013, corporate investment is
expected to offset the fall in public investment as

low interest rates and a recovering lending activity,
private-sector deleveraging is coming to a halt.
Nevertheless, the high loan stock will likely
remain a drag on credit growth.
Consumption growth was firm throughout 2012,
registering only a slight deceleration as retail trade
growth slowed to 5-6% at year-end. Rapidly
falling unemployment and increasing real wages,
combined with a consumer confidence above longterm average, fed into still strong consumption
growth which is nevertheless forecast to slow from
4.2% in 2012 to 3% in 2013 as labour income
growth moderates. In addition, the planned
increase in some benefits and pensions should
support the ability of poorer households to cope
with high inflation and to uphold consumption.

… in a still broadly balanced labour market …

The unemployment rate (age 15-74) continued to
decline rapidly to 9.3% in the fourth quarter of
2012 as output growth rebounded. The labour
force participation ratio remained historically high
and is assumed to increase further due to the
changing age structure. Employment growth has
been sustained at 2.6% in 2012, but is temporarily
decelerating due mainly to a seasonal effect.
Nominal wage growth is expected to stabilise at
around 5.4% in 2013 and 6.1% in 2014, with real
wage growth increasingly positive at 1.8% in 2013
and 2.9% in 2014. Vacancy rates were again
lower, calming fears that skill mismatches could
soon push up wage growth even further and
hamper competitiveness and recovery.

…with slowly declining inflation

been considerably better in 2012 than the targeted
deficit of 2.6% of GDP planned in the Stability
Programme update of spring 2012.

As global commodity prices declined in the last
quarter of the year, the 12-month-average HICP
inflation receded to 4.2% at end-2012. It is
expected to stabilise until late 2013. Inflation in
2013 will be affected by administrative changes
that will mainly push prices up: most importantly,
increases by 5-6% in alcohol and tobacco excises
and the full opening of Estonia's electricity market,
which will be accompanied by higher transfer fees.
The introduction of free public transport in Tallinn
will offset price increases to some extent. Overall,
declining global commodity prices in 2013 and
2014 are assumed to ensure that inflation will
continue its slow decline. Finally, as wage growth
remained moderate in the second half of 2012 and
core inflation remains tamed, there is no short-term
risk of significant wage inflation. However, the
unemployment rate has already dropped to the
NAWRU so that this might become an issue in the
coming quarters.

This year, one-off expenditure factors will scale
down and the budget deficit is expected to improve
to 0.4% of GDP. In 2014, the fiscal balance is
projected to revert to a surplus of 0.2% of GDP.
The unfreezing of the public wage bill with a
planned wage increase of 4.4% for civil servants,
along with a pension increase of 5% and a cut in

to 3% as fixed in the 2013 state budget, will add
pressures to the budget balance. Local elections in
October 2013 might also have an impact on public
expenditure.
Net of cyclical and one-off effects, the general
government structural balance is forecast to have
reached a surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2012 and is
expected to fluctuate around balance thereafter.
The general government debt will increase over
the forecast horizon from 10.5% of GDP in 2012
to 11.3% in 2014, mostly owing to the EFSF and
ESM contributions. In addition, a capital injection
into the state-owned electricity company is also set
to increase the public debt.

Public finances in order

7. IRELAND
Easing financing conditions and a modest growth recovery
2012 growth stronger than expected

Stronger data than expected for the third quarter of
2012 and upward revisions to GDP in the first and
second quarter brought real GDP growth to above
0.8% during the first three quarters of 2012
compared to the same period of the previous year.
Growth was more broad-based than during the last
few years, with not only net exports but also
investment and private consumption showing
positive growth rates in year-on-year terms (the
latter category for the first time since 2010).
Nominal GDP grew by 3.5% during the same
period mainly on the back of strongly increasing
trade prices. Several positive releases of highfrequency indicators such as tax collections, retail
sales, unemployment, real estate prices and PMIs
also appear to suggest a relatively resilient
performance of the Irish economy throughout
2012.
Following these positive data developments, real
GDP growth for 2012 has been revised up to 0.7%
from 0.4% at the time of the autumn forecast. 2013
growth projections are left unchanged, as upside
risks to domestic demand are expected to roughly
offset increasing downside risks to trading
partners' demand and export performance.
Positive signs from financial markets

Secondary market sovereign-bond yields have
recently fallen down to their lowest level since
April 2010, and especially so after the agreement
on the promissory notes and the liquidation of the
asset recovery bank IBRC in early February 2013.
Ireland also issued a five-year syndicated bond at a
yield of 3.3% in January 2013, while Treasury bill
yields have fallen with each auction conducted,
most recently to 0.2%. Lead by developments in
sovereign yields, guaranteed bank-bond yields
have also declined, and banks have recently issued
non-guaranteed covered bonds on favourable
terms. The sale of the government's holding of
contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds in a domestic
bank also further underscore the quickly improving
market sentiment. Lower sovereign and bank
funding costs have, however, not yet markedly
translated into lower lending rates to households
and corporates.

46

Domestic demand: the first signs of revival

While the positive investment data in the third
quarter of 2012 was to a large extent driven by
one-off events such as large purchases of transport
equipment from aircraft leasing companies, there
are signs that the investment cycle has bottomed
out more generally. Going forward, the
multinational (MNE) sector is expected to account
for the bulk of investment, as credit constraints are
still acute for domestic firms and fiscal
consolidation continues apace. The pace of
household deleveraging is expected to moderate
slightly, improving prospects for private
consumption over the projection period, although
resolution of non-performing loans remains crucial
to durably revive domestic demand. Faster
progress in that area and positive confidence
effects from resolution of macroeconomic and
policy uncertainty are therefore important upside
risks.
Mixed export performance

The relatively muted performance of goods exports
throughout 2012 is expected to continue in the
coming years due to the weakening trading
partners' demand and expiring pharmaceutical
patents, although high import content and low
employment intensity in the pharmaceutical sector
are reasons to believe that the eventual impact on
GDP of the latter might be more muted. Supported
by resilient services exports, the current-account
surplus is expected to keep growing during the
projection period, although worsening trading
partners' demand would undermine this outlook.
Subdued labour market and inflation

Inflation abated at the end of 2012, bringing the
annual average rate to 1.9%, and the
unemployment rate eased to 14.6% in recent
months from 15% a year earlier. Going forward,
the absence of cost-push pressures both from
abroad and the domestic economy is expected to
result in relatively modest inflation. The weak
demand in the employment-intensive economy
coupled with some skills mismatches is expected
to result in only slowly declining unemployment in
the coming years.

Member States, Ireland

Strong fiscal outturn improves prospects

The 2012 general government deficit is estimated
at 7.7% of GDP – some ¾ pp. lower than projected
in the autumn 2012 forecast. This is largely due to
higher-than-planned one-off revenue from the sale
of mobile spectrum licences, capital expenditure
savings and stronger-than-expected tax revenue.
Expenditure overruns in social and health services,
linked to higher-than-expected unemployment and
poor budget implementation, were partly offset by
savings in other areas.
The fiscal deficit is projected at 7.3% of GDP in
2013 and 4.2% in 2014 – below the 2013 budget
target in each year. (28) The better-than-expected
tax revenue outturn in 2012, excluding one-off
revenue surprises, improves fiscal balance by 0.1%
of GDP over the forecast horizon. Liquidation of
state-owned Irish Bank Resolution Corporation
(IBRC) and related replacement of the promissory
notes with long-term government bonds improves
fiscal balance by 0.1% of GDP in 2013 and 0.7%
in 2014. This operation reduces government

The deficit forecast excludes potential one-off financial
sector support measures. Resolution of certain credit
unions may have a one-off deficit-increasing effect, but
timing and amount in uncertain at this point.

interest costs and financing needs, as well as
generates interest margin profit for the central
bank. This forecast includes one-off payments to
IBRC creditors of 0.6% of GDP in 2013, but
excludes compensation for possible shortfall in
IBRC asset sales by liquidator.
This forecast includes fiscal adjustment measures
of 4.3% of GDP in 2013-14, of which about twothirds is on the expenditure side and the rest on the
revenue side. Among them 0.4% of GDP addresses
the 2012 health spending overruns and brings
expenditure in line with the ministerial ceilings.
Expenditure is projected to be in line with the
budget allocations and within the government
expenditure ceilings for 2013-14.
The government debt-to-GDP ratio increased from
25% in 2007 to 106% in 2011, and will peak at
around 122% in 2013 before declining. Moving
from primary deficits into surplus in 2014 and the
pick-up in economic growth will arrest debt
dynamics. High precautionary cash balances stood
at 11% of GDP at end-2012, but and are projected
to decline to 7% by end-2014, thus contributing to
gross debt reduction.

8. GREECE
Conditions set for emerging from turbulence
Confidence returning after deep crisis

Greece is emerging from a tumultuous 2012 with
renewed commitment and action within a
strengthened economic adjustment programme that
enjoys strong backing from its international
lenders. After the conclusion of a six-month
review of the programme and the release of over
EUR 50 bn in December 2012, there have been
some tentative signs of improvement. Banks have
seen a reversal of deposit outflows and Greek
market interest rates have been reduced
significantly.

The start of a recovery in 2014

The return to positive quarterly growth rates by
end-2013 will be followed by positive full-year
growth of 0.6% in 2014. This reflects ongoing
positive supply-side developments. Reductions in
unit labour costs (due to far-reaching labour
market reforms) and product market liberalisation
are expected to create new business opportunities
and to encourage job creation once the economy
picks up. In addition, the bank recapitalisation
process and the overall stabilisation of the country
are setting the preconditions for a return of capital
to the country and renewed credit flows to the
private sector. With a large part of the fiscal
consolidation effort already legislated, consumers
and investors appear to start regaining confidence
which should strengthen domestic demand in
2014. Unemployment is nonetheless forecast to
remain elevated at 25.7%.

Demand contracts further in 2013

Nevertheless, carry-over from 2012 as well as the
ongoing fiscal consolidation are projected to result
in a further contraction of 4.4% of GDP in 2013.
Investment is likely to continue underperforming
in the short-run, as the majority of businesses still
face liquidity constraints or wait to see more
evidence of a pick-up of the economy. Though
exports are projected to grow as the economy is
improving its competitiveness, they are likely to
remain subdued due to still weak external
conditions. It is expected that these factors will
continue to dominate for most of 2013, only
partially compensated by the reversal of the
liquidity squeeze, notably as the government plans
to repay arrears for an amount of up to 4% of
GDP. In line with this contraction in demand, the
unemployment rate is now expected to peak at
27.0% in 2013.

Continuing
correction
of
the
external
imbalance, improving competitiveness…

Greater
flexibility
in
wage

arrangements drives the forecast for decreasing
labour costs. Compensation per employee is
projected to fall by 7.0% in 2013 and by 2.0% in
2014. Together with the effect of structural
reforms in the product market, this is expected to
translate into HICP deflation of 0.8% and 0.4%
respectively in 2013 and 2014, leading to a
significant inflation differential vis-à-vis the euroarea
average.
This
improvement
in
competitiveness, combined with euro-area
recovery, should lead to export growth. The
current-account deficit is expected to decrease

Member States, Greece

from 7.7% of GDP in 2012 to 4.3% in 2013 and
3.3% in 2014.
… and strong progress in balancing fiscal
accounts

In 2013 the government aims at primary balance
followed by a primary surplus in 2014. This is
supported by a package of savings measures
amounting to 7.2% of GDP over 2013-14 which
was adopted in November. Given interest payment
reductions of almost 1% due to the debt-reducing
measures adopted by the Eurogroup in late 2012,
the overall government deficit in 2013 is now
expected to be 4.6% of GDP. The structural
balance is estimated to reach a surplus of 1¾%.
Gross public debt is estimated at 162% of GDP in
2012, 15% of GDP lower than in the autumn 2012
forecast, mainly thanks to the debt buyback
operation carried out in December 2012. The debt
ratio is projected to increase to 176% of GDP in
2013 as the economy contracts, after which it is
expected to fall at an accelerated pace, supported
by an improving budget balance and stronger
nominal GDP growth.

Risks to the baseline outlook

On the upside, there is a distinct possibility for a
stronger return of confidence and the start of the
recovery earlier in 2013. This would in turn have
positive spillovers on the fiscal balance.
Additionally, the repayment of government arrears
in 2013 and the reversal of the liquidity squeeze
may have a stronger impact on private sector
demand thereby offering a bigger offset to fiscal
consolidation than projected. On the downside, any
hesitation in programme implementation, in both
the fiscal and the structural area, may deter
investors and weigh on demand. Employment may
respond more negatively than forecast to the
depressed demand conditions expected in 2013.
The one-off costs of measures related to the
banking sector and tax refund arrears, whose
recording is currently being assessed by statistical
authorities, are expected to impact the deficit in
2012 and/or 2013, although at least part of this
statistical recording would not affect programme
targets.

9. SPAIN
Net exports only source of growth over forecast horizon
External financing conditions improve but the
real economy still remains subdued

External financing pressures, which had weighed
on the Spanish economy for most of the year,
started to ease towards the end of 2012. The
announcement of the Outright Monetary
Transactions programme by the ECB and other
decisions at euro-area level, in combination with
progress on bank recapitalisation and restructuring
under the banking sector programme and progress
on key structural reforms, led to a reduction in the
Spanish sovereign bond spreads and a higher
inflow of private foreign capital. However this
improvement in external financing conditions for
the sovereign and for financial institutions has not
yet fully reached the real economy. Therefore, the
short-term outlook for internal credit conditions
remains broadly similar to the autumn 2012
forecast.
The rebalancing of the Spanish economy continued
in the second half of 2012, with the share of net
exports in GDP rising at the expense of domestic
demand. The protracted correction of the large
external and internal imbalances accumulated in
the boom period is holding back private
consumption and investment. This continues to
have a large negative effect on employment and,
hence, unemployment is set to rise further. The
necessary consolidation of public finances is also
weighing on economic growth in the short term.
Real GDP is expected to contract by around 1½%
in 2012 and 2013. After the intensification of the
contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012, the fall in
GDP is expected to moderate in the course of
2013, with GDP bottoming out towards the end of
the year. Economic growth is expected to return to
positive territory in 2014 under the usual
no-policy-change assumption.
The rebalancing of the economy is expected to
proceed over the forecast horizon. Private
consumption is forecast to continue to contract on
the back of rising unemployment and household
deleveraging, although the contraction of
households' gross disposable income is set to ease
in 2013. However, the saving rate is likely to
remain low, as consumers attempt to smooth their
consumption level. Private investment is affected
by the subdued economic outlook. Thus, despite

50

the relative strength of exports, which are one of
the most important drivers of investment in
equipment, private investment should continue to
contract. Notably, the adjustment of residential
investment is maintained, with housing starts at
historically low levels and continuing to fall.

On the positive side, exports are set to remain
strong and to contribute positively to GDP growth.
Despite a weakening outlook for the euro area, the
main destination of Spanish exports, export sales
have shown significant resilience. Improvements
in price competitiveness and strong increases of
exports towards emerging market economies
support this positive outlook. Alongside the
relatively good performance of exports, imports
are contracting sharply due to weak domestic
demand. As a result, Spain has reduced its overall
external deficit and is set to record a currentaccount surplus from 2013 onwards.
Employment destruction accelerated in the last
quarter of 2012, pushing the unemployment rate to
a record high of 26%. In 2013, the effects of the
latest labour market reform should start to have a
more noticeable effect, allowing a more balanced
adjustment between wages and employment,
which could reduce the pace of job destruction.
There are already signs that wages are becoming
more sensitive to the economic situation, with a
clear moderation of wage growth in 2012. This
wage moderation is taking place alongside
significant increases in apparent labour
productivity. As a result, Spanish cost
competitiveness is improving, which is a necessary
factor for the continuing expansion of exports.

Member States, Spain

Fiscal consolidation
revenue growth

hampered

by

weak

Following the entry into force of additional
consolidation measures (increase in VAT,
elimination of the Christmas bonus in the public
sector, corporate tax measures), budgetary
consolidation advanced in the final months of
2012. Also at regional level, expenditure cuts in
education are expected to have had their main
impact in the last quarter. For the year as a whole,
the deficit is therefore expected to narrow to about
7% of GDP, down from 8.9% in 2011, excluding
in both years the effects of bank recapitalisations.
The latter are currently estimated at around 3.2%
of GDP in 2012, but final figures will only be
available after the EDP notification in April.
The budgetary performance in 2012 was blighted
by considerable shortfalls of both indirect and
direct tax revenues. These shortfalls are linked
with negative composition effects (due, inter alia,
to shifts in private consumption patterns and the
slump in housing transactions), an even sharperthan-expected fall in employment and labour
income, and negative asset price developments.
Additional revenue-raising measures introduced

throughout the year helped to offset these
shortfalls, so that final tax revenues are likely to
have turned out broadly in line with initial plans.
In 2013, the general government deficit (excluding
bank recapitalisations) is expected to narrow
somewhat further, thanks to discretionary
measures likely to more than offset the impact of
the continued recession. The general government
deficit is forecast to reach around 6¾% of GDP in
2013. Stronger VAT revenues due to the full effect
of the rate hike and some increased cost control
should outweigh an increase in expenditure on
social transfers and interest. Despite the return to
positive, albeit weak, growth in 2014, the general
government deficit is expected to deteriorate to
around 7¼% of GDP on a no-policy-change
assumption, due to the possible expiry of some of
the measures introduced in 2012.
Large public deficits, negative or low nominal
GDP growth and the costs of bank recapitalisation
are likely to result in a rise of the general
government gross debt from around 88% of GDP
in 2012 to above 100% of GDP in 2014.

10. FRANCE
Postponed recovery weighs on public finance
Sluggish recovery ahead

The French economic activity has stagnated in
2012. In 2013, in view of a still decreasing
household real disposable income linked in
particular to rising unemployment and of the
unfavourable entrepreneurs' confidence, GDP is
projected to increase only by 0.1%. Still, economic
activity is expected to pick up during the second
half of the year based on the timid rebound of the
external sector. This would trigger a modest
revival of economic agents' confidence, which is
set to translate into a more robust growth in 2014,
reaching 1.2% for the year as a whole.

likely to have significantly dented entrepreneurs’
expectations and therefore their appetite to invest
in 2013. This, together with projected weak
demand, is set to discourage firms from
significantly restoring investment in 2013. In 2014,
the gradual increase in aggregate demand and
improved general confidence is expected to
translate in a partial catch-up in investment.
External trade driven by a slowdown in imports

Although exports have been relatively dynamic in
2012, thanks in particular to buoyant aeronautic
sales, developments in the medium term are
expected to remain somewhat weaker than the
world demand. Indeed, the persistent deterioration
in external competitiveness is not likely to be
reversed in the short term. Still, the projected
weakness of imports in 2013 is expected to lead to
a positive contribution of net exports to GDP
growth (0.3 pp.). In 2014, the economic recovery,
which would cause imports to surge, and a still
ailing export competitiveness, would bring trade
contribution below zero (-0.2 pp.).
Persistent
rise
in
unemployment
decreasing inflationary pressures

Private consumption to remain resilient

In 2013, as in 2012, private consumption is
expected to remain resilient, thanks to a further
decrease in the saving rate and in spite of
decreasing disposable income in real terms in a
context of rising unemployment. In 2014, the
stabilisation in the labour market, together with
lower fiscal consolidation in line with the usual nopolicy-change assumption, will contribute to a
recovery in real disposable income thus allowing a
rebound in private consumption spending (1.2%).
No pick up in investment in the short term

Although credit conditions appear relatively
favourable, the conditions for a rapid pick-up in
investment are not likely to be met. The flat
economic growth in 2012 and the enduring
deterioration in the profit margins of non-financial
companies, which reached a trough in 2011, are

52

and

Employment started decreasing in 2012 while the
unemployment rate rose rapidly to 10.5% in the
fourth quarter, against 9.8% one year before. In the
current context of stagnating economic activity and
rigid nominal wages, employers are likely to focus
more on restoring productivity, to the detriment of
job creation. Despite the ongoing efforts to reform
the labour market, unemployment is thus expected
to continue rising to 10.7% and 11.0% in 2013 and
2014.
After a relatively high level of inflation in 2012
resulting from past rises in energy prices, inflation
is set to decrease to 1.6% in 2013 and 1.5% in
2014, in a context of stabilised energy prices.
Some uncertainties remain

Risks on the forecast are broadly balanced. On the
one hand, a quicker recovery might materialise due
to regained confidence in the euro area. On the
other hand, the rebound in both external and
domestic demand may once again be delayed.

Member States, France

Additionally, persisting competitiveness losses
might weigh more on growth than expected.
Fiscal accounts in a crucial juncture

In 2012, the general government deficit is expected
to have reached 4.6% of GDP based on the latest
data available, broadly in line with official plans
(excluding the 0.1% negative impact of Dexia's
recapitalisation for which a decision on the
statistical treatment by Eurostat is still pending)
and down from 5.2% in 2011. Indeed, the state
budget execution showed only minor tax revenue
shortfalls and spending was kept under control. In
addition, available information suggests that
healthcare expenditure was slightly below target.
In 2013, the headline deficit is set to further
decrease on the back of the measures adopted
notably as part of the budget (which aims at 3% of
GDP). Additional revenues are set to yield an
estimated 1.5% of GDP. While the Constitutional
Court has abolished some tax measures included in
the budget, this will only have a negligible impact
on the deficit. Current expenditure rules (central
government and healthcare) are renewed and this

will contribute to maintaining spending restraint.
On the other hand, GDP growth projected well
below potential will negatively affect the headline
deficit. Overall, this is expected to reach 3.7% of
GDP, well above this year's official target. The
difference mainly stems from divergent
macroeconomic scenarios (official GDP growth
forecast is at 0.8%) while the structural deficit is
expected to be reduced by some 1¼% of GDP.
Under
the
customary
no-policy-change
assumption, the deficit is forecast to deteriorate
marginally in 2014. The fresh corporate tax credit
compétitivité-emploi is set to increase the deficit
given that part of its financing is still to be
specified in detail.
Overall, this implies a cumulated improvement in
the structural balance of around 2½% of GDP in
2012-13, which remains broadly stable, at
unchanged policies, in 2014. The debt ratio, which
is forecast to have reached 90% of GDP already
last year, will continue to rise in 2013-14 on the
back of still relatively high general government
deficits and subdued nominal GDP growth.

11. ITALY
Economic recession bottoming out in mid-2013
The protracted recession to end in mid-2013

The recession extended throughout 2012,
completing six consecutive quarters of contraction
in economic activity. As a result, in 2012 as a
whole, real GDP is estimated to have declined by
2.2%. Domestic demand fell significantly, as high
uncertainty, tight financing conditions and the
impact of fiscal consolidation hit consumption and
investment. This led to a collapse in imports, while
exports increased on the back of sustained demand
from non-EU trade partners. Therefore, net exports
stemmed the real GDP drop and the trade balance
turned positive for the first time since 2004.
Indicators point to further contraction in economic
activity in the first quarter of 2013, though at a
slowing pace. Investment is set to decline - also
due to still tight financing conditions for the
private sector - while consumers continue to
refrain from spending on the back of long
declining real disposable income. By contrast,
sustained demand from non-EU trade partners
continues to support exports. Lower yields on
government securities are expected to gradually
translate into improving financing conditions and
confidence. As a result, domestic demand, and in
particular investment in equipment, is set to
resume growth in the second half of 2013.
However, the negative carry-over from 2012
implies that real GDP in 2013 as a whole is still
projected to decline by 1%. Once again, net
exports are set to provide a positive contribution to
growth, as imports contract further.

In 2014, the projected normalisation in financing
conditions and reduced uncertainty are set to
sustain activity. As a result, private consumption is
expected to increase slightly more than disposable
income due to improving confidence, while
investment in equipment picks up. As both imports
and exports accelerate, net exports are no longer
expected to contribute to growth. Real GDP is
forecast to increase by 0.8%.
The trade balance continues improving over the
forecast horizon and in 2013 the current account is
set to turn into surplus for the first time since 2001.
Fewer hours
employment

worked

cushion

the

fall

in

In 2012, full-time equivalent employment is
estimated to have fallen by 1.3% but, as hours
worked per person fell significantly, the decline in
headcount employment was more contained
(-0.2%). Combined with increased participation
among younger and older people, this entailed a
rise in the unemployment rate by more than 2 pps.
Contractual wages for the economy as a whole
rose by 1.5%, as private sector wages increased by
2% while public sector wages remained frozen.
Actual wage growth is estimated to have been
more subdued, reflecting a negative wage drift.
The annual increase in nominal unit labour costs is
thus anticipated at around 2% despite the decline
in labour productivity due to some labour
hoarding. In 2013, on the back of the further
contraction in economic activity, employment is
projected to continue declining and the
unemployment rate to rise by another percentage
point. Adjustment in employment entails some
labour productivity recovery, while wage growth
remains subdued, resulting in a deceleration of
nominal unit labour costs to around 1%. In 2014,
the gradual recovery in economic activity is
expected to lead to a small increase in employment
and a further recovery in labour productivity.
In 2013, HICP inflation is expected to decline to
2.0%, from 3.3% in 2012, as energy prices
decelerate and the impact on prices of the enacted
increases in indirect taxation is lower than in 2012.
Weak domestic demand and limited pressure from
labour costs are set to curb inflation to 1.7% in
2014.

Member States, Italy

A structurally balanced budget in 2013

In 2012, the general government deficit is
estimated at 2.9% of GDP, from 3.9% in 2011,
thanks to a primary surplus increasing to 2.6% of
GDP while interest expenditure surged by 0.6 pp.
of GDP. Primary expenditure is estimated to have
stabilised year-on-year, for the third year in a row.
Social transfers increased slowly as the pension
reforms are delaying access to retirement, while
pensions above three times the minimum did not
benefit from the indexation to inflation. The wage
bill continued shrinking due to the wage freeze and
employment downsizing. Revenues are estimated
to have risen sharply despite the fall in nominal
GDP, on the back of increased taxation on
immovable property, transport fuel and financial
wealth. By contrast, despite a higher standard rate,
the VAT outturn declined as purchases of tax-rich
durable goods dropped.
Thanks to the full implementation of the
consolidation measures adopted in 2011-12, the
deficit is projected to narrow further to 2.1% of
GDP in 2013, with an increasing primary surplus
and marginally lower interest expenditure. Primary
expenditure is set to remain broadly stable again
due to further restraints in the wage bill and

moderate increases in social transfers, but also
thanks to the impact of the spending review
adopted in the summer of 2012. Revenues are set
to increase slightly more than nominal GDP as the
further 1 pp. increase in the standard VAT rate and
the new tax on financial transactions are only
partially offset by renewed tax incentives to
productivity-related pay and increased allowances
for dependent children. In 2014, the deficit is
projected to stabilise at 2.1% of GDP. Primary
expenditure is set to increase slightly year-on-year
due to more dynamic social transfers as the
non-indexation of higher pensions expires.
Revenues are expected to rise less than nominal
GDP, also on the back of further tax breaks for
hiring new permanent employees.
In structural terms, a broadly balanced budgetary
position is expected for 2013, thanks to a structural
adjustment of 3½ pps. of GDP in 2012-13. The
structural primary surplus is set to reach 5% of
GDP in 2013 and recede marginally in 2014.
The gross debt is projected to peak at 128.1% of
GDP in 2013, before falling in 2014 thanks to the
sizeable primary surplus and the return of
economic growth.

12. CYPRUS
Prolonged recession and deleveraging ahead
Strong contraction of the economy in 2012 …

Economic activity in Cyprus significantly
weakened with real GDP expected to have
decreased by 2.3% in 2012, in line with the
autumn forecast. The deterioration was driven by a
marked contraction of domestic demand against
the background of falling domestic consumption
and private investment. The largest fall in
economic activity took place in construction and in
the broad industrial sector, while financial services
also showed sign of weakening activity. The fiscal
consolidation implemented at the end of 2011, the
significant deterioration in the labour market, and
the prolonged high economic uncertainty
concerning Cyprus's request for financial
assistance in June 2012 have all weighted on
private consumption. The ongoing process of
deleveraging also implied tightening credit
conditions, which together with the high-level of
corporate indebtedness and the weak business and
consumer confidence (the lowest in the EU), hit
investment activity strongly. At the same time, the
contribution of net exports to GDP growth is
expected to have been stronger than previously
anticipated due to the stronger export performance
of goods and services (tourism being the main
driver). A significant decline in the volume of
imports, mainly goods, resulted from the subdued
domestic demand and lower import propensity.
While the trade balance is expected to have
improved, the current-account balance is projected
to have worsened due to a deterioration of the
income balance stemming from developments in
the financial sector, particularly through its
financial activities in Greece.
… sets to deteriorate further in 2013 and 2014

Projections of the economic outlook for 2013 and
2014 point to a prolonged recession, due to further
declines in domestic demand and investment
activity. The effects of much-needed fiscal
consolidation measures (including measures
affecting public sector wages, social outlays,
increases in employee contributions, and indirect
taxes), coupled with increasing unemployment, are
likely to weigh strongly on household disposable
income. On the back of banks deleveraging and the
deceleration of credit growth, gross fixed capital
formation is expected to decline further, with the

56

growth rates of the construction activity remaining
negative over the forecast horizon.
The external sector is set to provide a positive
contribution to growth this year and next year.
Prospects for the exports of goods and services
remain favourable, particularly for tourism
services (underlying the good prospects for high
tourist arrivals particularly from Russia) and some
business services (accounting, legal, and
information society services). At the same time,
import of goods and services should continue to
fall against backdrop of weak domestic demand.
Overall, the current-account balance is expected to
improve gradually over the forecast horizon,
driven by imports but yet conditional on the
outlook of the income balance.

Unemployment rates jump to historically high
levels…

Labour market conditions are expected to have
worsened in 2012 with the unemployment rate
reaching a record 12.1% and to worsen further in
subsequent years, reflecting the contraction of the
economic activity. The subdued business activity,
the hiring freeze in the public sector, and the
developments in domestic demand have all
weighted on employment in 2012 with job losses
particular pronounced in the construction and
agricultural sectors. Average wage growth in 2012
is expected to decline compared to the previous
year and the unfavourable economic environment
is set to affect wages in the economy as a whole,
influenced also by the cuts in public sector wages
and benefits.

Member States, Cyprus

.. while inflation declines.

HICP inflation declined in 2012 reflecting the
decline in electricity and oil product prices.
Subdued domestic demand and lower disposable
income are projected to lower inflation further in
2013 and 2014 in spite of the higher indirect taxes
(VAT and excise duties) adopted.
Excessive government deficit persists…

The government deficit improved slightly despite
the sizeable consolidation implemented in 2012.
Revenues stagnated due to less tax-rich growth,
lower corporate profitability and deteriorating
labour market conditions. Expenditure reduction
was lower than expected, in particular due to the
increased number of early retirements and growing
unemployment albeit investments were being
reduced. In both 2013 and 2014, the deficit and
structural deficit is set to decrease gradually thanks
to the adopted consolidation measures. The debtto-GDP ratio reached 86.5% in 2012, due to the
deficit, nominal GDP developments, and the
participation in a bank recapitalisation..

… while downside risks exist.

Risks remain important and tilted to the downside.
The conclusion of a macro-economic adjustment
programme would be of paramount importance in
stabilising the economy, but risks would remain on
both the external environment and the domestic
front. In spite of recent developments, the
worsening of economic conditions in Greece
remain a downside risk for Cyprus. On the
domestic front, downside risks are associated with
domestic credit conditions due to financial sector
deleveraging, the worsening of labour market
conditions, a stronger than expected fall in house
prices, and a further loss of business and consumer
confidence from prolonged economic uncertainty.
Also, the restructuring of the Cypriot banking
sector could have stronger effects on related
professional business services. Upside risks for the
economy may emerge in 2014 with higher
investment activity in the energy sector.

13. LATVIA
Strong growth amid low inflation and robust public finances
Growth beats expectations again

Latvia's economy continued growing at a strong
pace in 2012 despite the weak external
environment. According to the Eurostat flash
estimate, GDP rose by seasonally adjusted 5.2% in
2012, marking only a minor slowdown from 5.5%
in 2011. Growth was broadly balanced on the
demand side while construction and manufacturing
were major contributors on the supply side.

GDP growth (y-o-y%)

Although the economic sentiment indicator for
Latvia remains favourable, GDP growth is still
forecast to slow to 3.8% in 2013, taking into
account the latest high-frequency indicators and
diminishing positive effects from favourable
weather and exceptionally good agricultural crops
in 2012. Growth is, however, expected to improve
again to 4.1% in 2014 on account of rising external
demand. Both domestic demand and exports are
seen as robust growth drivers in 2013-14. The
country's economy is thus projected to remain one
of the fastest growing in Europe and the risks to
the forecast appear broadly balanced.
External balance is stabilising

After the extreme fluctuations in the external
balance over the past boom-and-bust cycles, the
latest estimates suggest that the current-account
deficit is stabilising in a range of 2-4% of GDP
over the forecast horizon. Exports grew much
faster than imports in 2012 and the deficit in the
trade in goods and services contracted, according
to the provisional data published by the Bank of
Latvia. The process was partly backed by

58

agricultural exports benefiting from the
exceptionally
high
grain
crops.
Many
manufacturing branches, in particular metal
processing, as well as port, transport and tourism
services also contributed to the improvement in the
foreign trade. The current-account deficit is
forecast to widen only marginally in 2013-14,
fuelled by import demand for investment goods
and further expansion of the net outflow in the
income account.

Consumer price inflation (HICP) slowed to 2.3%
in 2012 from 4.2% in 2011 helped by the VAT cut
from 22% to 21% as of July 2012, downward
corrections in the prices of energy and agricultural
commodities, and continuous decline in prices of
non-energy industrial goods. Inflation is projected
to remain low at 1.9% in 2013 and 2.2% in 2014 as
import commodities and trade in merchandise
goods keep playing a favourable role. Core
inflation is set to move up closer to the headline
index over the forecast horizon as rising wages and
employment are likely to put some upward
pressure on prices of services.
Labour market benefits from both supply and
demand hikes

The labour market improved markedly in the
second half of 2012 bringing the year-average
unemployment rate down to 14.9% from 16.2% in
2011. Employment also improved at a strong rate
of 2.8% and the labour force expanded by 1.3% in
2012 amid a large decline in emigration flows.
According to the preliminary data of the Latvian
statistical office, long-term net emigration
contracted substantially in 2012 to a level that was
even lower than in the period of 2000-07 when the
economy was growing at record high rates. The
latest economic sentiment surveys published by the
European Commission show that employment is
expected to rise further albeit at a slower rate than
in 2012. Accordingly, unemployment is forecast to
drop to 12.2% in 2014. Vacancy rates remain very
low and labour supply is relatively strong which is
likely to keep wage dynamics broadly in line with
productivity gains. Nevertheless, some companies
are already complaining about skill shortages in
specific sectors, but at the aggregate level the
problem still looks benign.

Member States, Latvia

Budgetary target likely overachieved

been taken since the cut-off date of the autumn
forecast; main policy changes that entered into
force since January 2013 include a 1 pp. reduction
in personal income tax rate, an increase in state
contributions to the private funded pension pillar
from 2% to 4% of gross wages and a limited
increase in some social benefits. The personal
income tax rate is set to be further lowered by
2 pps. from January 2014. At the same time,
pension indexation remains suspended until late
2014 and several social benefits are capped. The
structural balance is expected to worsen by ½ pp.
in 2013 and to remain broadly stable in 2014.

In 2012, robust economic developments are
expected to result in a better budgetary outcome –
now estimated as a deficit of 1.5% of GDP – than
was expected in the autumn forecast,(29) and also
considerably below the earlier official deficit target
of 1.9% of GDP. The large improvement in the
deficit-to-GDP ratio in both the nominal and the
structural term, compared to the 2011 outcome, is
projected to be achieved despite the adoption of
the expansionary supplementary budget and the
1 pp. VAT rate cut in mid-2012. The 0.9 pp.
improvement in the structural balance reflects
sizeable consolidation measures of the original
2012 budget and likely also the improving tax
compliance, given considerable policy efforts in
this area.

The general government debt is projected to
increase to above 44% of GDP in 2013, as the
authorities accumulate assets for future repayments
of debt, and to decline below 42% of GDP in 2014,
as the repayments take effect. In late 2012 the
authorities made an early repayment of their
outstanding obligations towards the IMF under the
2009-11 financial assistance programme, replacing
this part of official debt by market financing.

This better outcome leads to lower deficit
projections, compared with the earlier forecast,
also in 2013 and 2014, with a budgetary position
now expected at respectively -1.1% and -0.9% of
GDP. No major new fiscal policy decisions have
(29)

This includes now also an estimated increase of the deficit
by 0.5 pp. due to the sectoral reclassification of a financial
defeasance unit, still subject to final decision on its
statistical measurement.

14. LITHUANIA
Steady growth ahead
Exceptionally high net-exports offset slowing
domestic demand in 2012

In 2012 Lithuania had another year of robust
economic growth. Real GDP expanded by
estimated 3.6%, driven by private consumption
and net exports. Private consumption was initially
the main growth engine, but lost steam during the
year. The euro-area turbulences over the summer
resulted in low business confidence and ultimately
in a contraction of investment in the third quarter.
Yet, GDP growth accelerated in the second half of
the year thanks to a considerable expansion in net
exports. Export of goods and services is estimated
to have grown in real terms in 2012 by 10.2% and
import by 6.0%. This buoyant development was
supported by strong growth in the other Baltic
States, a partial refocus of trade flows towards the
CIS, and a record harvest boosting exports of
agricultural products. As a result, the trade and
current-account balances improved.

grow over the forecast horizon as it continues to be
supported by EU co-financed projects. Private
consumption growth, however, is expected to slow
down and evolve more in line with the wage bill in
2013 and 2014.
Last year's export performance was to some extent
exceptional and based on one-offs like the harvest.
Thus, it is expected that gains in market shares and
export growth will decelerate in 2013 before
picking up once the external environment
improves. Given the high import-intensity of
exports, import growth is also forecast to
decelerate in 2013, but less than proportionally due
to rising imports of capital goods for investment.
Against this background, net exports are
anticipated to contribute negatively to growth over
the forecast horizon and the current-account deficit
to widen accordingly.
Consequently, Lithuania's real GDP is forecast to
grow by 3.1% in 2013 and by 3.6% in 2014 with
broadly balanced risks. On the downside, there is a
risk that the pick-up in investment and therefore
growth could be delayed. Upside risks are related
to the export performance in case Lithuania was to
keep gaining market shares as in 2012.
Inflation keeps moderating

Investment set to resume in 2013

Looking ahead, growth is set to continue, but its
composition is expected to change. Recent highfrequency indicators suggest an improvement in
economic sentiment and sustained output growth.
In particular, private investment is expected to pick
up, as credit is in principle available, interest rates
are at a historical low, and companies have
significant reserves to finance potential
investment. Additionally, capacity utilisation is
above its long-term average, and a majority of
businesses indicated plans to increase their
investment in 2013. Public investment will also

60

Inflation (HICP) decreased to 3.2% in 2012
reflecting weaker growth in food and energy
prices. Core inflation remained at 2.4% as the
slower price growth of processed food was offset
by a higher one in services and industrial goods.
These trends are expected to prevail. While core
inflation is projected to inch up in 2013 and 2014,
the overall HICP is set to moderate further on the
back of lower commodity prices. It is forecast to
decrease to 2.4% in 2013 before picking up to
2.9% in 2014, when a reduced VAT rate applied to
residential heating is about to expire.
Labour market set to improve at a slower pace

Employment continued to grow across all sectors
in 2012 and the unemployment rate is estimated to
have decreased to 13% (from 15.3% in 2011).
However, businesses have remained cautious and
tended to hire more part-time workers. Job creation
is expected to continue albeit at a slower pace, in
line with economic growth and a possible lack of

Member States, Lithuania

skilled labour. The unemployment rate is projected
to decrease to 11.4% in 2013 and 9.8% in 2014.
Real wage growth was positive in 2012 after three
years of contraction. It is forecast to continue,
supported by a 17.6% increase in minimum wage.
This measure is targeted at replacing a significant
part of informal wage payments, and should thus
have only limited impact on the labour market.
However, there is a downside risk, as unskilled
employment could suffer and wage pressures could
emerge across the economy. This could be further
accentuated in 2014 as the unemployment rate is
projected to fall below the estimated NAWRU.
This would also increase domestic inflation
pressures beyond the forecast horizon.
Fiscal improvements supported by GDP growth

In 2012, Lithuania's general government deficit is
estimated to fall to 3.2% of GDP and is forecast to
narrow further to 2.9% in 2013 and 2.4% in 2014
on the back of continued economic growth and a
limited increase in expenditure. Total revenue and
expenditure in 2012 were close to the budget plan.
Tax revenues were supported by a steady
collection of direct taxes, and notably higher-thanexpected corporate income tax revenue, which

more than compensated for slightly lower indirect
tax revenues. Non-tax revenues included sizeable
dividends from state-owned enterprises, but sales
of carbon rights fell considerably short of plan.
The deficit of the state social insurance fund SoDra
was lower than planned due to improving
performance of the labour market.
The 2013 budget restricts expenditure growth to
secure further improvements in the fiscal deficit.
The public sector wage freeze has been extended
into 2013. However, the sizeable rise in minimum
wages is set to increase the public sector wage bill,
albeit expected to be offset by higher social
contributions and personal income tax collection.
On the revenue side, an increase in excise duties
on gasoline and cigarettes is expected to
compensate for reduced VAT rates on transport
and media, but not sufficiently to cover an
extension of reduced VAT rates for residential
heating and medicines. SoDra is assumed to reduce
its deficit as the labour market is set to improve.
The structural deficit is estimated to decrease from
2.7% of GDP in 2012 to 2.2% in 2013 and 2014.
General government debt is set to stabilise slightly
around 40½% in 2013 and 2014, shrinking from an
estimated 41.1% of GDP in 2012.

15. LUXEMBOURG
Less manufactures made in Luxembourg
In 2012 growth continued to be lacklustre showing
a saw-tooth profile over the first three quarters
when output increased by 0.1% and 0.5% q-o-q in
the first two quarters to curb down by 0.3% in the
third quarter. While growth is still more dynamic
than in the rest of the euro area, these rates are
lower than before the burst of the crisis.
Over 2012 the industrial, and in particular the steel
sector has been hit severely by the slowdown of
activity across the euro-area and have seen its
share shrinking both in terms of gross value added
and employment with plants being closed down.
The financial services sector has continued to
show a positive although weakening trend.

the year. Support to growth from government
activities is expected to lessen following the
announced retrenchment in public consumption
and investment. The expected impact exerted by
the consolidation measures on households'
disposable income coupled with the low consumer
confidence level is expected to additionally impact
consumption and investment, despite the relief
provided from lower price evolution. Low level of
capacity utilisation associated with a weak demand
is assumed to put a question mark on firms'
investment plans. Financial services are expected
to continue to contribute positively to growth as
the development in the fund and insurance
industries will compensate for the slack in the
traditional intermediation activity where, despite
the criteria for lending being assessed as not
particularly tight, demand for credit remains low.
Overall growth in 2013 will result in a 0.5%
increase on average.
In 2014, GDP is projected to grow by 1.6%, still
far below its pre-crisis rates. The main contribution
will come from domestic demand backed by
higher level of confidence, while net exports are
also expected to contribute positively.

Available national soft and hard indicators depict a
broadly sluggish outlook for the last quarter of the
year in line with similar developments in the euro
area. The overall confidence indicators in the
industrial and the construction sectors have
deteriorated recently and are now at, or very close
to, a relative minimum. Growth expectations for
2012 were then lowered compared to our autumn
forecast and output is set to have only slightly
increased by 0.2%. In 2012 net export are likely to
have been a drag for the economy shaving 1.3 pps.
off growth. The government counter-cyclical
stance is expected to have supported domestic
growth. Both public consumption and investment
would have expanded fast while the contribution to
growth from the private sector would have
remained subdued.
The weakness is expected to protract in the first
half of 2013 and a return of activity to be triggered
by a surge in external demand in the final part of

62

The main downside risk for this growth scenario
refers to the capacity of financial services to keep
on creating wealth in the Grand Duché, as well as
that of the country to keep the existing or even
attract new industries.
Lower inflation to come

After peaking at 3.7% in 2011, HICP slowed down
to 2.9% in 2012. It has been driven upwards by
rising prices for oil and other raw materials. The
dampening effect on inflation exerted by less
dynamic oil prices in 2013 and 2014 will only be
partially offset in 2013 by the planned rises in
administered prices and the index is expected to
abate to 1.7% and 1.6% in 2013 and 2014,
respectively. Core inflation, which excludes the
most volatile components, is expected to fall from
2.5% in 2011 to 2.3% in 2012 and to 2.1% in 2013
to slightly increase to 2.2% 2014.
A less dynamic labour market

Job creation in Luxembourg still remained robust
in 2012 at 2.2%. However, this employment
increase has not been sufficient to bring down the

Member States, Luxembourg

unemployment rate, which stabilised just at 5%
due to buoyant increase in the participation rate.
With economic growth only slightly positive over
the forecast horizon the quest for productivity
gains will imply some adjustment on employment.
Job creation is then expected to decelerate to
around 1.0% in 2013 as labour hoarding will
finally be limited, moving the unemployment rate
higher to 5.4% as the active population continue to
record strong increases. In 2014 unemployment is
projected to reach 5.7% as the increase in the
labour population will not be offset by the mild
recovery in the labour market. The agreement with
the social partners to limit the automatic
indexation to 2.5% up to 2014 will put a lid to
wage growth over the forecast horizon and help
moderate the increase in unit labour costs.
Public finances remain strong in spite of
deterioration

The general government deficit is expected to
deteriorate from 0.3% of GDP in 2011 to 1.5% in
2012, constituting a sizeable slippage compared to
the original target of 0.7% of GDP set in the
original budget. The deterioration can be mostly
attributed to the central government, even if the
surplus of the social security subsector is also
supposed to have slightly declined. In spite of

weaker than anticipated economic growth a surge
in VAT revenues from e-commerce related
activities has compensate for a shortfall in social
contribution revenues. On the other hand,
government
consumption
expenditure
has
continued to follow a dynamic rising trend.
In 2013 the general government deficit is projected
to decline to 0.9% of GDP. The implementation of
the consolidation package adopted by the
government with the 2013 budget is expected to
curb the evolution of expenditure and boost
revenues. In 2014, under the usual no-policychange assumption, the deficit-to-GDP ratio is
expected to increase to 1.3% of GDP as the
acceleration in revenues supported by higher
growth will not offset the rising trend in
government expenditure. As a result, the structural
deficit, estimated at around ¾% of GDP in 2012, is
projected to improve to a small surplus of 0.1% of
GDP in 2013 and deteriorate in 2014 to a deficit of
about ¾%, at unchanged policy.
Public debt is set to have increased to 20.5% of
GDP in 2012 from 18.3% in 2011. In 2013 and
2014 the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to reach
22.2% and 24.1%, respectively.

16. HUNGARY
Slow economic recovery weighs on public finances
Weak recovery after recession

In 2012, the Hungarian economy entered into
recession with GDP contracting by 1.7%. After a
short recovery in 2011, domestic demand has
fallen over 3%. Investment continued to contract
for the fourth consecutive year, against the
background of tight lending conditions. Falling
disposable income and high unemployment
contributed to a renewed decline in consumption.
This was partly on account of a sharp drop in
stocks, due to unusually weak output in the
agricultural sector as a consequence of a drought.
Export growth cushioned the fall in GDP but its
pace has declined sharply on account of a
deteriorating external environment.
For 2013 stagnation is expected. Export markets
are set to improve and the decline in domestic
demand is assumed to slow down. In view of the
unfavourable lending conditions, investment and
household consumption expenditure are still
expected to decline by around 1½% and ½%
respectively although the latter is to benefit from a
rise in real disposable income.
In 2014, growth is expected to accelerate and reach
1¼% in line with an increased contribution from
net exports and some expansion in domestic
demand. Household consumption is projected to
turn into a slightly positive territory on account of
a further increase in real disposable income.
Private investment is set to remain negative in
view of the continued fall in corporate lending; on
the other hand, government investment may be
boosted by a higher inflow of EU funds.
Risks associated to this forecast point to both
directions. Tighter than assumed financial
conditions could lead to weaker growth. On the
other hand, recent official statements on fiscal
loosening measures can result in some short term
gains in consumption.
Labour market conditions remain contained

Despite an increase in employment, the
unemployment rate stabilised at 10.9% in 2012.
The participation rate improved as a result of
several government measures (e.g. extension of the
retirement age). From 2013 onwards, labour
market conditions are likely to remain weak. While

64

the participation rate is projected to grow further,
only a small increase in employment is foreseen.
Therefore, unemployment is expected to remain at
two digit level. Firms are expected to adjust to
weaker profitability conditions partly by reducing
their employment but this will be counteracted by
the increasing size of the public work scheme and
the rise in SME employment.
A drop in inflation

A drop in inflation is forecast for 2013. In addition
to the lower overall effect of indirect tax hikes
compared to 2012, this drop is also due to the cut
in regulated energy and other utility prices
introduced in January 2013. These regulated price
cuts might continue according to government
communication, which holds downward risks to
inflation. Effects of new sectoral taxes bear the
possibility to cause spill-over price effects but to
some extent this is offset by the disinflation effect
of the still weak domestic demand.
2012 fiscal deficit below 3% of GDP…

In 2012 the fiscal deficit is forecast to be 2.4% of
GDP, i.e. broadly in line with the autumn forecast
and below the revised target of 2.7% of GDP, also
thanks to one-off revenues of close to 1% of GDP.
Although the tax revenues, notably the VAT, were
lower than expected in the last quarter of 2012 by
¼% of GDP, it was mainly off-set by the
activation of contingent expenditure cuts.
…but above in 2013 and 2014

In 2013 the deficit is foreseen to be 3.4% of GDP,
i.e. above the revised target of 2.7% of GDP and
also exceeding the deficit of 2.9% of GDP
projected in the autumn forecast. The increasing
deficit in 2013 compared to 2012 can mainly be
attributed to the phasing out of temporary
extraordinary taxes introduced in 2010 and other
one-off revenues of altogether 1% of GDP, the
revenue reducing stimulus measures of beyond
½% of GDP as well as the reduction of the
personal income tax for higher earners of more
than ¼% of GDP. Some other individually smaller
elements (e.g. extended public work scheme,
extraordinary support of the higher education
sector, fiscal impact of the lower than budgeted

Member States, Hungary

inflation) will also increase the deficit altogether
by around ¾% of GDP.
These deficit increasing developments are set to be
partly off-set by saving measures announced in the
context of the 2011 and 2012 Convergence
Programmes, which will improve the deficit by
somewhat more than ½% of GDP in 2013
compared to 2012, although the implementation of
these saving measures largely lags behind
compared to the original plans in selected areas.
Moreover, corrective measures announced in
autumn 2012, mainly higher taxes, can reduce the
deficit by around 1¼% of GDP in 2013.
The 2014 deficit, based on the usual no-policychange assumption, is projected to remain at 3.4%
of GDP. The planned new wage compensation
scheme in the public education sector, the foreseen
need of capital transfer to the central bank and the
increasing interest expenditure is expected to be
offset by the economic recovery and further
revenues related to the implementation of selected
reform measures (e.g. distance based road toll).

The potential introduction of the new wage
compensation scheme in the public sector already
in September 2013 and the deductibility of the
child allowances from the social security
contribution, as recently suggested by official
statements, would increase the deficit further.
These risks could be offset by the implementation
of the distance road system, the enhancement of
the tax administration and the collection of the
financial transaction duty fully in line with the
(recently reinforced) plans.
Debt reduction loses its impetus

The improvement of the structural deficit by 2½%
of GDP in 2012 compensates its cumulative
deterioration of 2% of GDP in 2010 and 2011.
However, the structural deficit is forecast to
increase again in 2013 and 2014, by ¼% and ½%
of GDP, respectively. Accordingly, the debt is
forecast to only gradually decrease from 78.6% of
GDP in 2012 to 77.7% in 2014.

17. MALTA
Growth gradually gaining pace
After decelerating in 2012, economic growth
resumes slowly …

the current-account balance is forecast to remain
positive over the forecast horizon.

Real GDP growth is expected to have slowed
down further in 2012 as despite a relatively
resilient labour market, consumer confidence was
very low. This was reflected in subdued private
consumption. Following a significant drop in 2011,
fixed investment stabilised in 2012, against the
background of improving profitability. Net exports
continued to be the main driver of growth,
reflecting the particularly resilient performance of
the tourism sector and sustained growth in
financial services.

… supported by a resilient labour market

The labour market continues to prove resilient and
job creation is projected to remain robust
throughout the forecast horizon, significantly
outperforming the euro-area average. Employment
growth is expected to have reached 1.7% in 2012,
largely on the back of the expanding services
sector, while industrial employment continued
shrinking. Going forward, as the economic outlook
brightens, employment and average wage growth
are forecast to strengthen and move towards their
pre-crisis average. The unemployment rate is
projected to remain among the lowest in the euro
area and further narrow to 6.1% in 2014.
Risks to this scenario appear balanced. The
currently uncertain political situation in Malta,
ahead of the parliamentary elections in March,
could have a further negative impact on consumer
and business confidence and delay the recovery of
domestic demand in 2013. On the upside, the
rapidly developing financial sector could benefit
from the assumed stabilisation in the euro-area
financial markets and resuming confidence, thus
supporting real GDP growth.

Real GDP as a whole is expected to have increased
by 1% in 2012 and, as domestic demand gradually
strengthens, growth is projected to accelerate to
1.5% in 2013 and 2% in 2014. Indeed, domestic
demand is seen to become the main driver of
growth in 2013-14. Consumer confidence started
improving in the final months of 2012 and this,
added to increasing disposable income, is
projected to support household consumption in
2013-14. Fixed investments are projected to
improve further, but remain well below pre-crisis
levels. In particular, construction investment is
forecast to pick up slightly on the back of EUfunded projects as well as the electricity
interconnector with Sicily, which is scheduled for
completion by end-2013. By contrast, housing
investment is expected to remain subdued, in line
with the expected moderate outlook for the
housing market. The upturn in domestic demand
will stimulate imports, thereby reducing the trade
balance. However, net exports are expected to
continue to add positively to economic growth and

66

HICP inflation moderates but remains above
euro-area average

Price growth in 2012 was higher than expected and
HICP inflation averaged 3.1%, up from 2.5% in
the previous year. The main reason, however, was
higher prices for tourist services, which are mainly
oriented towards foreigners and therefore have
little impact on domestic consumption. Indeed, the
domestic measure of inflation, the Retail Price
Index, actually shows a slight deceleration
compared to 2011. HICP inflation is forecast to
slow down in 2013-14. Price growth is expected to
moderate across all main categories in 2013 and in
particular in services, also due to the relatively
high base in 2012. As private consumption
recovers, services inflation is expected to pick up
in 2014, but its impact on overall HICP is forecast
to be offset by slower growth in foods prices.
Overall, total HICP is expected to be higher than
the euro-area average over the forecast horizon.

Member States, Malta

Budget deficit projected to widen in 2013 in the
absence of a budget

The headline general government deficit is
projected to have improved in 2012. Current
primary expenditure is expected to have
accelerated, outpacing nominal GDP growth,
mainly due to higher social transfers and subsidies
to the national energy company (Enemalta). By
contrast, compensation of employees in the public
sector is set to have grown at a more moderate
pace as a result of continued hiring restraints. In
spite of dynamic investment and the planned
equity injection into Air Malta, net capital
expenditure as a share of GDP is projected to have
declined, on account of negative capital asset sales.
Current revenues are projected to have increased
mainly on the back of measures targeted at
increasing VAT revenue collection.
The draft 2013 budget was presented by the
government at the end of November but failed to
receive parliamentary endorsement. In the absence
of consolidation measures, the deficit in 2013 is
expected to widen. Current primary expenditure is
forecast to drop by 0.3 pp. of GDP, reflecting a
continuation of the tight recruitment policy in the

public sector as well as subdued dynamics of
social transfers from the impact of the 2006
pension reform. Net capital expenditure,
comprising the planned additional equity injection
into Air Malta of 0.6% of GDP, is expected to
grow by 0.5 pp. of GDP. The increase in tax
revenue related to the pick-up in economic activity
only partly compensates for the disappearance of
the one-off revenues expected in 2012. As a result,
current revenues are projected to decline slightly.
In 2014, the deficit is projected to narrow, on the
back of domestic demand-driven growth but also
due to a lower equity injection into Air Malta.
After having improved by more than 1 pp. of GDP
in 2011, the structural deficit is expected to remain
stable in 2012 and, on a no-policy-change
assumption, is forecast to improve by ½ pp. of
GDP in 2013 and by ¼ pp. of GDP in 2014. The
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue
increasing over the forecast horizon, as the primary
balance is not high enough to allow a reduction in
the debt ratio. The main downside risk to this
scenario is related to the financial situation of
Enemalta, which could entail additional subsidies.

18. THE NETHERLANDS
Housing market adjustments impose a drag on economic activity
Significant contraction in GDP in 2012

Since the second quarter of 2011, quarter-onquarter economic growth in the Netherlands has
been negative, apart from the first half of 2012,
when it was marginally above zero.

some pension funds and a soft patch in external
demand exerts a substantial drag on households
and corporations.

Real GDP decreased by 1% in the third quarter of
2012, its strongest decline since 2009. Net exports,
which had been supporting growth in the five
previous quarters, turned strongly negative, while
domestic demand continued to decline. Real GDP
continued to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2012,
with private consumption falling for the eight
quarter in a row, to a level last reached in 2003.
Despite a marked improvement in January,
consumer confidence remains close to historical
lows, with particularly weak readings for
indicators of the financial situation and
unemployment expectations. Given limited
nominal increases in contractual wages, gains in
gross disposable income for the working
population are expected to remain very limited in
the near future. In addition, the prolonged decline
of house prices is expected to continue over the
forecast horizon and the associated negative wealth
and confidence effects are likely to constrain
consumption expenditure.
The difficult situation in the housing market has
translated into a lower number of transactions and
a very sharp drop in the level of activity in the
construction sector. The number of building
permits has steadily fallen from a peak in 2006 and
confidence in the construction sector reached
historical lows in the last quarter of 2012.
Investment in dwellings continued to decline.
Domestic demand set to remain weak,

Real GDP growth is forecast to remain negative in
2013 at -0.6%. This is almost solely the result of a
negative carry-over from 2012, since quarterly
growth is projected to return to modest positive
territory in the course of 2013, on the back of
supportive trade developments, which are set to
recover from a soft ending last year. By contrast,
domestic demand is expected to remain depressed
well into 2013. The combination of employment
losses, budget consolidation, continued weakness
in the housing market, cuts in pension payments by

68

The decline in domestic demand should come to a
halt in the second half of the year, with growth
turning mildly positive in 2014. This is supported
by tax relief for employees, which should translate
into a positive impact on private consumption, and
by a recovery in private investment, especially for
export-oriented businesses. Downside risks mainly
relate to unemployment and the strength of
housing-related balance sheet adjustments.
Inflation easing over the forecast horizon

In 2012, HICP inflation stood close to 3%, having
been boosted by increases in energy prices and
policy measures, notably the increased VAT rate
as of October 2012. Looking forward, the
disinflationary effects of weak domestic demand
and decreasing oil prices should be partly
compensated in the near term by the lagged
upward pressures from the increase in the standard
VAT tax rate. As a result, inflation is likely to fall
only modestly to 2.6% in 2013 and to ease further
to 1.4% in 2014.
Unemployment on the rise

Towards the end of 2012, the trend increase in the
unemployment rate was accentuated and the
unemployment rate reached 5.8% in December.
The main reasons behind this development are the
weak economic environment and prospects,
especially in housing-market-related sectors. Most
companies were able to retain the vast majority of
their labour forces in the wake of the crisis, due to
existing buffers and the desire not to lose skilled

Member States, The Netherlands

workers in the event of a relatively swift recovery.
However, with the prolonged weakness in activity,
the buffers of firms are starting to get depleted as
the private sector faces an increasing number of
bankruptcies. Against this background, despite
moderate wage growth and labour productivity
increases, unemployment is expected to rise
further to 6.3% in 2013 and 6.5% in 2014.
Slow improvement in the deficit

The general government deficit is expected to have
improved from 4.5% of GDP in 2011 to 4.1% in
2012, in light of consolidation measures that
mainly increased revenues (notably a 2 pps.
increase in the standard VAT as of October 2012).
Against a background of weak economic activity,
the deficit is expected to improve only gradually to
3.6% of GDP in 2013 despite substantial additional
consolidation measures. The projections for 2013
take into account two one-off operations, which
essentially cancel each other out. The proceeds of
the sale of 4G mobile telephony licenses, worth
around 0.6% of GDP, are likely to be offset by the
deficit-increasing impact of the nationalisation of
the bank-insurance company SNS Reaal.

Under the assumption of no policy changes, the
deficit should stabilise in 2014 as the excess of
expenditure over ordinary revenue is offset by a
special bank levy related to the nationalisation of
SNS Reaal. The structural balance is expected to
improve strongly by around 1 pp. in both 2012 and
2013, before deteriorating in 2014 by around 0.5
pp. of GDP. The debt ratio is expected to increase
from 70.8% of GDP in 2012 to 73.8% in 2013 and
75.0% in 2014, mainly due to persistent deficits
and the nationalisation of SNS Reaal, increasing
public debt by 1.6% of GDP in 2013.

With hiring in manufacturing drawing to a halt,
employment growth has been decelerating, while
the unemployment rate edged up to 4.4% in the
third and fourth quarters. The recovery of business
and consumer confidence stalled in the second
quarter and subsequently sentiment slid to a new
low in October. It has regained some ground since
then, however with significant heterogeneity
across sectors.
Moderate recovery in the course of 2013

These developments are likely to dampen the
upturn in GDP growth which is expected to start to
recover moderately in 2013. Low carry-over will
weigh on overall growth for 2013 before it regains
momentum in 2014 as confidence is rebuilt.
Employment growth is set to continue slowing
down as labour cost pressures limit the scope for
employment gains in 2013. Nevertheless, real
wage growth is likely to stay positive, not least

70

Manufacturers' backlogs weakened further in
January 2013 and capacity utilisation has been
gradually subsiding over 2011-12. Accordingly,
investment is not likely to see a robust expansion
before 2014. Still a gradual upturn in 2013 may be
in order, to ensure the adequacy of the capital
stock in anticipation of a pick-up in demand. The
corporate sector has accumulated significant
savings over the recent years and should not have
financing difficulties, provided companies keep
cost pressures at bay.
The exporting sectors are forecast to benefit from
gradually improving external demand conditions in
relevant markets over the forecast horizon.
Industrial productivity has improved further in
2012, while unit labour costs have increased only
moderately, hence cost competitiveness does not
seem to have been impaired. All in all, the external
balance is projected to stay positive and provide a
positive contribution to growth.
The balance of risks seems neutral to slightly
positive. While downside risks stemming from
weaker foreign demand cannot be discounted,
domestic demand may well present a positive
surprise if the latest improvement in sentiment
proves firm. Financing conditions are relatively
favourable and could spur investment demand.
Following receding energy and food prices in early
2012, headline inflation declined to 2.3% in
August but rebounded to 2.9% in OctoberDecember. The latter was due, inter alia, to labour
cost pressures in certain services. Nevertheless,
inflationary pressures are expected to dissipate in
the course of 2013-2014 with inflation moving
closer to 2%.
Fiscal consolidation to remain on track

The government deficit is expected to have risen in
2012 due to one-off factors including the cost of
supporting the banking system (0.7% of GDP).
However, the combined effect of discretionary
measures approved in March 2012 and resilient
revenue growth have helped contain the rise in the
deficit.

Member States, Austria

In 2013 the projected deceleration in GDP growth
is expected to have an adverse impact on public
finances which will likely lead to a relatively small
rise in the deficit.

The expected acceleration of economic activity
and further effects of the measures included in last
year consolidation package are projected to further
reduce government deficit in 2014.

The structural budget balance is projected to
significantly improve in 2013 in light of a
widening output gap, while the pace of structural
deficit reduction is expected to slow down in 2014.

After rising further in 2013, government debt is
expected to reverse trend from 2014 onwards, as
the deficit subsides and growth strengthens.

On the revenue side, high employment and the
lagged effect of the substantial increase in wages
in 2012 are likely to sustain the tax base for
households' direct taxes and social security
contributions. The larger estimated increase in
corporations' operating surplus should also lead to
a more robust surge in corporation tax revenues in
2013.

effect in 2013. On the other hand, additional
support to the banking system (0.3% of GDP), in
particular to Hypo Alpe Adria should have an
adverse effect on the deficit.

20. POLAND
Flying on one engine
Economic activity
domestic demand

hampered

by

weak

After some deceleration of economic activity in
the first half of 2012 (2.9%), real GDP growth
continued sliding down in the second half of 2012,
reaching 2% over the whole year. External trade
was a strong support for economic activity as
exports were relatively robust while import growth
was limited due to sluggish domestic demand.
Private consumption growth (0.5%) disappointed
strongly as labour market prospects worsened, real
wages declined and consumer sentiment
deteriorated. Against this backdrop, investment
growth was limited (0.6%) and also hampered by
worsening financing conditions and a slowdown in
public investments triggered by EU-funds cycle
and fiscal consolidation.
Difficult 2013 and moderate recovery in 2014

Weak economic outlook of the main trading
partners is expected to hamper domestic
confidence and worsen the situation of exporters,
resulting in constrained domestic demand growth
in 2013. Some rebound in domestic demand is
projected only towards the end of the year. Real
GDP is forecast to increase by 1.2% in 2013 and
2.2% in 2014.
Public investment growth is projected to be
strongly negative, as public spending is expected
to be curbed further due to fiscal consolidation
needs and lower EU-funds inflow. Private
investment is forecast to moderate in 2013 as a
result of uncertain demand prospects and weak
global sentiment. However, the expected
improvement in external demand at the end of
2013 is likely to revive confidence and improve
prospects for exporters. This in turn is set to fuel
private investment as companies have sufficient
cash at their disposal and credit supply is set to
accelerate.
The unemployment rate is forecast to increase
from 10.2% in 2012 to 10.9% in 2014 due to the
sluggish economic activity. It is likely to weaken
disposable income, but rising real wages thanks to
contained inflationary pressures are projected to
offset somewhat this effect. Moreover, household
savings are set to increase on the back of waning
consumer confidence, constraining domestic

72

demand as well. Only towards the end of the
forecast horizon the improving labour market
conditions, recovering confidence and cuts in VAT
rates are likely to accelerate private consumption.
The contribution of external trade to growth is
forecast to be positive, though declining, over the
forecast horizon. Weak external outlook is set to
hamper exports, yet limited domestic demand will
result in an even stronger import compression in
2013. In 2014 rebounding external demand and
improving cost competitiveness are likely to fuel
exports. Since in parallel imports are expected to
grow as well due to the accelerating domestic
demand, the overall effect on real GDP growth is
projected to moderate. Against this backdrop, the
current-account deficit is set to continue improving
from 3.6% of GDP in 2012 to 2.4% of GDP in
2014.
This forecast is subject to broadly balanced risks.
On the upside, a stronger-than-expected
depreciation would further boost exports and
enhance import substitution. On the downside,
more profound deterioration in confidence could
hamper private investment and consumption.

Inflation decelerates amid weak domestic
demand

The zloty depreciation, high commodity prices and
an increase in administered prices drove up HICP
inflation to 3.7% in 2012. It is set to reverse to
1.8% in 2013, mainly on account of moderating
commodity prices, weak domestic demand and
declining gas prices. A moderate pick-up to 2.3%

Member States, Poland

is expected in 2014, reflecting base effects and
some improvement in domestic demand.
Fiscal consolidation slows down

The general government deficit is projected to
continue falling, albeit at a slow pace due to the
deteriorating macroeconomic outlook. In 2012 the
deficit is expected to decrease to slightly below
3.5% of GDP thanks to the previously enacted
consolidation measures.
In 2013, the deficit is projected to fall slightly to
3.4% as further consolidation measures are set to
be offset by slow economic growth. On the
revenue side, the main deficit-reducing measures
include CO2 emission rights auctions, a continued
freeze in PIT thresholds and fines from the new
speed-camera system. On the other hand, the share
of pension contributions retained in the public
pillar will start to fall (i.e. the share of the
contributions transferred to the private pension
funds will start increasing as their previous
reduction will be partially reversed). The main
structural measures decreasing expenditure are the

freeze of wages of central government employees
and the start of a gradual increase in retirement
age. Moreover, the government is set to further
lower public investment.
In 2014, the deficit is expected to further fall to
3.3%, thanks to a rebound in economic activity,
which is projected to offset the developments on
the revenue side. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is set
to fall due to the combined effect of the end of the
temporary increase in VAT rates, a reinstatement
of VAT reimbursement for company cars and fuel
and a further decrease in pension contributions
retained in the public pillar. On the other hand, the
gradual raise in the retirement age will have a
consolidating effect on expenditure.
The structural deficit is set to fall from 5.2% in
2011 to 1.7% in 2014. General government debtto-GDP ratio is forecast to increase from 56.4% in
2011 to 57.5% in 2014. The projected debt figures
are, however, subject to considerable uncertainty
due to high exchange-rate volatility affecting the
debt valuation.

21. PORTUGAL
Negative growth surprise could signal delayed recovery
Contraction in 2012 as domestic demand falls
and export growth decelerates

After an unexpectedly large 1.8% quarter-onquarter contraction in real GDP in the fourth
quarter of 2012, the annual average growth rate
turned out at -3.2% in 2012, 0.2 pp. worse than
expected in the autumn 2012 forecast. The largerthan-expected decline in economic activity was
driven by a marked contraction of domestic
demand as well as a deceleration of exports
towards the end of the year. Employment also fell
significantly stronger than expected in the fourth
quarter,
bringing
the
annual
average
unemployment rate to 15.7%. Due to a marked
easing of price pressures in the final quarter of last
year, average HICP inflation in 2012 was 2.8%.
Mild recovery expected for the second half of
2013

Real GDP is forecast to fall by 1.9% this year, as
opposed to the 1% fall projected in the autumn
2012 forecast. The close to 1 pp. downward
revision is primarily driven by the ¾ pp. additional
negative mechanical carry-over effect from the
unexpectedly strong Q4-2012 slump in real GDP
and the remainder is motivated by the less benign
outlook for Portugal's export markets as well as the
poor labour market developments.
Domestic demand is likely to continue contracting
during the first half of 2013. A gradual recovery in
economic activity should emerge in the second
half of the year, supported by the recent bottoming
out of business and consumer confidence along
with the expected pick-up in export demand. The
recovery is expected to gather pace in 2014 with
real GDP predicted to grow by 0.8%, with broadly
equal contributions from domestic and external
demand.
Developments in domestic demand are set to
continue weighing on employment in 2013 with
the unemployment rate peaking towards the end of
the year at just above 17½%. Some employment
gains are expected in 2014, when the economy is
set to gain traction. As a result of ample slack in
the economy, price pressures should remain weak
even when the economy is on a recovery path in
2014.

74

In spite of the downward revision in export
growth, the rebalancing of the economy should
continue in the coming years. The external balance
of goods and services is forecast to reach positive
territory in 2013, one year later than expected in
the autumn 2012 forecast due to a downward
revision of 2011 data. The adjustment in the
current account is slowed down by increasing
primary income deficits linked to the still-veryhigh level of foreign indebtedness.
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are clearly
tilted to the downside as the deeper-than-expected
worsening in the labour market situation may point
to a persisting deterioration of the growth outlook.
If this is confirmed by forthcoming data releases
on the composition of the contraction in the last
quarter of 2012, further downward revisions could
be warranted. The projected recovery is also
contingent on positive trade and financial market
developments which remain fragile. In addition, in
view of the largely revenue-based fiscal
adjustment, macro-fiscal feedback loops might be
more adverse to economic activity than projected.
On the positive side, spillovers from a gradual and
successful sovereign-bond market access could
help boost business investment.
Unexpected macroeconomic developments
weigh on fiscal consolidation

The general government deficit is expected to
reach 5% of GDP in 2012. Available cash data
showed a marked expenditure decline. This
compensated for lower-than-expected revenues
and social security contributions resulting from the

Member States, Portugal

continued rebalancing of the economy towards
exports and the more intense labour shedding.
There are, however, downside risks to the 2012
fiscal outcome related, in particular, to the
statistical treatment of the sale of the airport
concession and possible cash/accrual adjustments
that could widen the deficit in national-accounts
terms.
Following the downward revision of the
macroeconomic outlook, the general government
deficit is forecast at 4.9% of GDP in 2013. Weaker
revenues
resulting
from
more
subdued
consumption and labour market performance are
behind this revision. The projection considers
measures worth more than 3% of GDP, with a
strong reliance on revenue measures, inter alia a
profound reform of the personal income tax and
increases in excise duties and property taxation.
On the expenditure side, measures include
substantial decreases in the wage bill, intermediate
consumption and social transfers. Additional
downward risks arise from a further deterioration
of the macroeconomic outlook and the pending
decision of the Constitutional Court regarding
some high yielding budget measures. The

budgetary forecast is based on the usual
assumption of unchanged policies and does hence
not take into account any contingency measures
the government plans to adopt in view of the
expected deviation from the budget target in 2013.
The deficit is expected to reach 2.9% of GDP in
2014. This projection crucially hinges on the
projected economic recovery starting from mid2013. It also includes expenditure-reducing
measures worth at least 1¾% of GDP. With a view
to identifying these measures, the authorities are
conducting a comprehensive expenditure review to
improve public services efficiency and to generate
large permanent savings. The results will be
presented during the 7th review of the Economic
Adjustment Programme for Portugal and further
specified in the 2013 Stability Programme.
In structural terms, the cumulative adjustment over
the 2012-14 period is expected to be around 5% of
GDP for the overall balance and 5¾% for the
primary balance. The projected fiscal consolidation
and the gradual pick-up in growth are expected to
lead to a declining debt-to-GDP ratio over the
medium term after peaking in 2014.

22. ROMANIA
Domestic demand drives modest recovery
Flat growth in 2012

GDP growth for 2012 has been revised further
down compared to the 2012 autumn forecast and is
now estimated at only 0.2% according to the flash
GDP published by the National Institute of
Statistics. After harsh winter conditions depressed
growth in the first quarter, there was a short-lived
recovery in the second quarter on the back of
robust public and private investment and private
consumption. However, growth again turned
negative in the third quarter on account of the
severe summer drought affecting agriculture,
waning consumer confidence and renewed
difficulties in absorbing EU funds. In addition, a
higher surplus in the balance of transfers and
incomes supported a significant improvement in
the current-account deficit, to 3.8% of GDP.

Gradual recovery in 2013 and 2014

In 2013 GDP growth should recover modestly to
1.6%. Domestic demand would be the main driver
of growth, while net exports would contribute
negatively due to a slower growth in export
markets and stronger imports. Among demand
components, investment will be the main
contributor to growth, although it is projected to
slow down in comparison to 2012 due to weakerthan-expected economic activity in the rest of the
EU. Private consumption growth is expected to
accelerate, although it could be held back by
continuing needs for repairing households' balance
sheets and by tight consumer lending standards. In
2013, unlike in 2010-12, government consumption
is expected to deliver a marginally positive
contribution to growth as a result of the public

76

sector wage increases granted last year. GDP
growth is expected to accelerate to 2.5% in 2014
with a similar composition as in 2013: domestic
demand would continue to be the main driver,
powered by investment, while net exports
contribute negatively, albeit by less than in 2013.
The current-account deficit is expected to remain
around 4% of GDP over the forecast horizon.
Food and energy prices drive up inflation

Short-term price pressures have increased
significantly since the summer with HICP inflation
peaking at 5.4% in September due to rising food
prices and pass-through effects associated with the
leu's exchange rate depreciation. In line with the
planned price deregulation of both energy retail
and wholesale sectors, energy prices are expected
to exert upward pressure on inflation over the
forecast horizon. Food prices increases are forecast
to remain important in the first half of 2013 in
view of a negative base effect. Given the modest
recovery of the economy, wage pressures are likely
to remain subdued. Going forward, annual
inflation is projected to average 4.6% in 2013 and
3.3% in 2014. Risks to the short-term inflation
outlook are broadly balanced. The upside risks
relate to a further weakening of the leu's exchange
rate and higher unanticipated rises in commodity
prices. Conversely, a slower-than-expected
recovery in the economy would have
disinflationary effects.
Labour market remains weak

Despite further cuts in public sector employment,
overall employment somewhat recovered in 2012.
However, overall job creation was limited as the
improvement in regular employment was
counterbalanced by a negative job trend among the
self-employed. Due to the subdued economy,
employment is expected to recover only little over
the forecast horizon. On a positive note, despite the
difficult economic climate unemployment was
brought down from 7.4% of the labour force (age
group 15-74) in 2011 to 7% in 2012. However, as
active labour market measures are set to remain
small and not well targeted, unemployment is not
expected to go down significantly over the forecast
horizon. Youth unemployment, currently at around
23%, is expected to be somewhat reduced but is to
remain high. In 2013, as in 2012, public sector

Member States, Romania

wage increases are expected to outstrip private
sector wage growth due to the restoration of public
wages following the 25% wage cut occurred in
2010. While, going forward, average private sector
wage increases of employees are expected to be
anchored around 5%, unit labour costs growth is
expected to decelerate in 2014 due to increases in
productivity.
Ongoing fiscal consolidation supported by
revenue measures

Romania is expected to have reduced its
government deficit to below 3% of GDP in 2012.
The budgetary consequences from the financial
corrections on EU funds that became necessary at
the end of last year were compensated by windfall
revenue from the sale of telecommunications
licenses. Following the December general
elections, the budget for 2013 should be adopted in
February 2013. It targets a deficit of 2.4% of GDP
and allows for a 4% increase in pensions, an

allocation to implement the EU Late Payments
Directive in the health sector, as well as a clear
prioritisation of public investment projects.
Revenue-enhancing measures include reductions in
tax-deductible items, improving the taxation of
agriculture, and making the turnover tax of 3% on
small enterprises mandatory. Property tax and
excises rates are set also to be increased in an
effort to keep up with inflation, while a windfall
tax will be introduced following the deregulation
of gas prices. The minimum wage was increased
from RON 700 by RON 50 as of 1 February and is
projected to be increased by another RON 50 on
1 July (the increase in the minimum wage does not
affect personnel expenditure in the public sector as
the minimum wage here is already RON 811).
Benefiting from the expected acceleration in
economic activity and based on the customary nopolicy-change assumption, the deficit is expected
to decrease further to 2.2% of GDP in 2014. Public
debt is expected to stabilise at around 38% of GDP
in 2013-14.

23. SLOVENIA
Double-dip and on-going adjustment delay consolidation
Double-dip recession and further worsening of
growth potential

Slovenia slipped back into double dip recession
with two consecutive quarters of negative growth
in mid-2012. Protracted balance sheet repair
prolonged economic weakness, delaying fiscal
adjustment and pushing the current account further
into surplus. Continued weakening of investment,
combined with negative trends in employment and
domestic consumption, points to a further drop in
real GDP in 2013. A sluggish recovery can be
expected in 2014 but this will hinge on a swift
resolution of the banking crisis and a successful
restructuring of the over-indebted corporate sector.

demand. In total, these trends are foreseen to result
in a significant positive growth contribution of net
external demand.
Delay in urgently required balance sheet repair and
adverse labour market dynamics are amongst the
main contributors to the deterioration of domestic
demand. The consolidation in private and public
expenditure combined with weakness in export
performance produce an expected reduction in
employment of 1½%, pushing the unemployment
rate at around 9¾% in 2013. At the end of 2012 a
law was adopted aimed at restoring financial
stability and easing financing conditions. The law
provided for the set-up of a Bank Asset
Management Company to acquire non-performing
assets and to recapitalise the banks. However,
intensified political uncertainty in early-2013 is
posing a challenge to the implementation.
Headline inflation, excluding energy and
unprocessed food, is foreseen to remain subdued at
around 1½%. Wages are estimated to have
dropped slightly in 2012 without prospects for
increases in 2013, given the envisaged cut in the
public sector wage bill and increasing
unemployment.

Domestic demand is expected to remain weak in
2013, partly due to rising unemployment. Namely,
private consumption started to decline in 2012, and
is expected to diminish even further by more than
3% in 2013. The trend in gross fixed capital
formation remains strongly negative, particularly
in construction, although this is set to decrease at a
less dramatic rate in 2013. Investment in
equipment is expected to drop steadily in both
2012 and 2013, reflecting corporate sector
weakness and subdued credit growth.
Short term data on export order books indicate a
further drop in export volumes in the fourth quarter
of 2012, with annual export growth slowing to
only 1%. On the back of these year-end dynamics
and the expected slow recovery of the global
economy, export volumes are forecast to broadly
stabilise in 2013. Meanwhile, imports are expected
to fall again in 2013, due to declining domestic

78

In 2014, some stabilisation of the economy is
expected, although this process will be gradual and
subject to risks in both directions depending on the
speed of restructuring and developments in the
banking sector. Domestic demand, including
capital formation, is forecast to remain sluggish.
Significant
consolidation

but

The public deficit is projected to decline from
6.4% of GDP in 2011 (including 1.4 pps. of capital
support operations in loss-making state-owned
enterprises) to 4.4% of GDP in 2012.
Consolidation started in earnest in 2012, with a
package of measures including a nominal wage cut
in the public sector and reinforced restraint in
social transfers. The deficit-increasing capital
support operation to the largest bank amounted to
some ¼% of GDP. The tax system has been made
more growth-friendly with a gradual cut in the
corporate income tax rate and more generous
investment and R&D allowances, but this has
tended to work against the consolidation effort.

Member States, Slovenia

The 2013 deficit projection at 5.1% of GDP
incorporates the full-year impacts of the May 2012
savings package, the approved 2013 budget and
the conversion of a hybrid debt-equity instrument
of the largest bank into equity. This conversion
increases the deficit by 0.9 pp. of GDP. The budget
introduces a cut in the wage bill and integrates
effects of the December 2012 pension reform. A
marked recovery in capital expenditure is projected
from increased absorption of EU funds in 2013. A
variety of budgeted discretionary tax measures is
net-revenue increasing.
The 2014 budget does not incorporate new
discretionary measures, except for a reduction in
the corporate income tax rate to 16%. Therefore,
the 2014 deficit is projected at 4.7% of GDP under
the
no-policy-change
assumption.
Interest
expenditure will continue to augment due to higher
debt and average interest rates.
Due to the declining nominal fiscal deficit
(excluding one-offs) and widened output gap the

structural balance is forecast to improve markedly
in 2012 and moderately in 2013, followed by a
deterioration in 2014. The debt ratio is projected to
increase over the forecast horizon from 53¾% of
GDP in 2012 to 63½% of GDP in 2014, mainly as
a result of persisting primary deficits, rising
interests and subdued GDP growth.
The main risk to the deficit is a weaker budget
implementation. For 2014, this risk may be
partially offset by the conditional increase in the
standard VAT rate as stipulated in the Act on
Balancing Public Finances. However, details on an
implementation of this measure will be clarified in
spring 2014 only.
In addition, further significant fiscal resources may
be required to strengthen key banks. To this end,
the December 2012 Banking Stability Act makes
available up to EUR 4 bn (11% of GDP) of state
guarantees for asset transfer to an Asset
Management Company and up to EUR 1 bn (3%
of GDP) of cash for recapitalisations.

24. SLOVAKIA
Growth temporarily weakens as external boost tails off
Growth set to slow markedly in 2013

Growth in the Slovak economy slowed down
moderately in 2012, with GDP expected to have
increased by 2%. This overall positive
performance was nearly entirely driven by an
expansion in the export-oriented automotive
industry. The contribution of domestic demand to
GDP growth was disappointing, reflecting the
persistence of a high rate of unemployment in the
labour market and a drop in private investment.
With the effect of car exports fading out in 2013,
GDP growth is set to decelerate to 1.1%. The
forecast also reflects the adverse short-term impact
of a sizeable consolidation on private consumption
and public investment. In addition to fairly robust
external demand in 2014, consumer confidence
and domestic demand are expected to gradually
strengthen over the forecast horizon, underpinning
a pick-up in GDP growth to 2.9% in 2014.

to a halt in 2012, with the construction production
index having dropped by more than 10%.
This situation is expected to improve only
gradually. Declining trends in confidence, the postcrisis tightening of lending standards and the
expected impact of fiscal restraint on public
investment are all likely to hold back fresh
investment in construction. On the other hand, it is
foreseen that the rather high profitability of Slovak
corporates will support investment in equipment,
which is expected to resume in 2014 in line with
export demand.

Export growth to remain a key driver

With past investment reaching the production
phase, the manufacturing of transport equipment,
largely consisting of cars for export, accounted for
the whole 10% increase in industrial production in
2012. This, together with import growth dampened
by sluggish domestic demand, led to the widening
of the trade surplus to above 3% of GDP in 2012,
thus bringing the current account into balance.
With no further productive expansions of the car
industry planned for 2013 and high frequency
indicators pointing to reduced expectations on
orders and a drop in industrial production, export
growth is expected to decelerate sharply in the first
half of 2013. Given that profitability in the
tradable sector remains high, a moderate pick up is
expected to take place from the second half of
2013 onwards.
Domestic demand to stay subdued amid a
sluggish labour market

Investment plunged in 2012 reflecting a strong
base effect associated with large-scale projects
carried out in 2011 and business surveys pointing
to demand concerns increasingly limiting
production. This is in line with the bank lending
survey reporting a decline in corporate demand for
long-term loans despite rates being at historical
lows. Investment in the non-tradable sector ground

80

Private consumption declined further in 2012 and
is not expected to recover until 2014. With a large
and increasing pool of resources sitting idle and
GDP growth remaining well below the rates
associated with falling unemployment, real
disposable income of households is expected to
decline in 2013. The unemployment rate is set to
hover around 13½% over the forecast horizon,
remaining some 4 pps. above the pre-crisis level.
The forecast is subject to downside risks as it
assumes that employers will adjust mainly through
reductions in hours worked in 2013. Households
are nonetheless expected to prevent a further drop
in consumption in 2013 by drawing on their
savings.
In line with developments in the labour market,
unit labour costs are expected to remain contained.
Inflation is accordingly set to stabilise at close to
2% due to subdued domestic demand pressures
and imported inflation and the fading out of base
effects from previous price shocks.

Consolidation ahead

The deficit is estimated to reach 4.8% of GDP in
2012, only slightly lower than in 2011. In the
course of the year, the revenue side was negatively
impacted by substantial shortfalls in VAT, excise
duties and income tax revenues, while overruns
occurred on the wage bill, healthcare and
subsidies. A sharp drop in public investment was
the main factor contributing to the modest
improvement in the general government budget.
Other factors included slower growth of pension
expenditure and postponement of investments to
later years. Moreover, revenue measures adopted
during the summer of 2012 helped to mitigate
negative developments in public finances. The
package included a reduction in the contribution
rate for the fully funded pillar in favour of the
public scheme, a broadening of the base of the
bank levy introduced in January 2012 additional
one-off special levies for banks and for companies
operating in a regulated environment
Consolidation efforts will resume in 2013. The
2013-15 budget includes a second package of
revenue measures and envisages further

expenditure cuts. Extra revenue would come from
an increase in the corporate income tax rate from
19% to 23%, the introduction of a new 25% tax
bracket in the personal income tax system, an
adjustment of the tax regime for self-employed and
atypical work contracts (i.e. workers 'by
agreement'), changes to the assessment bases for
social
contributions,
and
increases
in
administration fees. The expected savings on the
expenditure side are mainly concentrated on the
public wage bill, spending on goods and services,
and investments. Local governments are expected
to carry out the largest part of this adjustment but
the forecast assumes these would not be achieved
in full. The projected headline deficit for 2013 is
3.3% of GDP. Taking into account the effect of
one-off measures, the structural balance is also
expected to reach 3.3% of GDP. A slight
deterioration in the headline deficit is projected for
2014 under unchanged policies. This reflects
mainly the fact that some consolidation measures
in 2013 are of one-off nature or are set to expire.
The public debt ratio is projected to increase
gradually over the forecast horizon and reach 57%
of GDP in 2014.

25. FINLAND
Domestic demand remains main growth driver
Slow recovery in sight up to 2014

The Finnish economy contracted in 2012 by 0.1%.
While private consumption remained strong,
supported by a strong labour market, public
consumption and exports were slightly negative.
Gross fixed capital formation receded due to
declines in construction and investment in
equipment.

investments in equipment, which can be explained
by generally low expectations regarding growth
perspectives in the near future. Construction is also
forecast to decline. Only in 2014 are investments
expected to pick up again, on the back of a
recovery in the world economy. Financing
conditions for investments remain adequate over
the forecasting horizon, since Finnish banks
benefit from good credit ratings and sound
liquidity positions.

During 2013 and 2014 confidence is expected to
gradually return, resulting in a strengthening
recovery. Private consumption, negatively
influenced in the first quarter of 2013 by the VAT
increase, will return to slow growth on the back of
stable disposable income. Due to the ongoing
restructuring of export-oriented industries, export
growth is expected to pick up only gradually as
imports recover in the main EU trading partners.
The decline in gross fixed capital formation in the
second half of 2012 carries over to 2013, with
growth returning in 2014. Subdued private
consumption and low investment keep a lid on
import growth in 2013.
Risks to the outlook are balanced. On the one
hand, the ongoing restructuring in certain
industries, notably the electronics sector, could
depress the employment and export performance
more than projected. On the other hand, a strongerthan-anticipated recovery of the EU and world
economy might stimulate exports in 2014.
Private consumption drops in 2013

The private consumption outlook for 2013 is
influenced by increases in VAT and income
taxation. Consumption growth will be subdued as
real disposable income will grow only slowly in
2013 before accelerating in 2014. Real disposable
income growth is affected by the wage agreement
for 2012 and 2013, setting moderate wage growth,
combined with the fiscal drag as wage brackets are
not adjusted for inflation. Household savings are
expected to increase somewhat, back to the level
of 2011.
Investments remain low in 2013

Gross fixed capital formation is expected to
decline (-1.5%) in 2013, mainly due to receding

82

Goods trade surplus set to shrink towards zero

The restructuring of two of the main export
industries, electronics and forestry, points to low
export growth in 2013. A slow pick-up on the back
of the recovery in world trade is forecast for 2014.
Imports are expected to remain subdued as private
consumption and investments are expected to
remain weak in 2013. The trade surplus of goods is
expected to shrink from its 2012 level of 0.9% of
GDP. It will, however, remain in positive territory
in 2013. The negative trade balance of services and
net current transfers drag the current-account
balance down to -1% in 2014.
Labour market remains relatively strong

The labour market remained strong in 2012,
although the sluggish growth caused a slight
increase in unemployment in the second half of the
year. The use of temporary layoff support facilities
has been reduced by employers and permanent
payroll cuts are more common.

Member States, Finland

Over the forecast horizon, the effects of low
economic growth will become more visible on the
labour market and unemployment is forecast to
increase to 8.0% in 2013. As unemployment
reacted with a lag to the worsening economic
situation, the expected improvements for 2014
would not have an immediate impact on
unemployment
either.
Therefore
the
unemployment rate is forecast to decline only to
7.9% in 2014.
The current collective wage agreement lasts until
the end of 2013. While unit labour cost growth
reached 4% in 2012, it is expected to be more
moderate in 2013 and 2014.
Prices stabilising in 2013-14

Despite the VAT increase of 1 pp. in 2013,
inflation is set to recede to 2.5% in 2013 and 2.2%
in 2014. The collective wage agreement for 2012
and 2013 has only a limited impact on inflation.
Lower growth prospects affect public finances

government finances. Government revenues are set
to increase in 2013 on account of the 1 pp. VAT
increase and the effective increase in income tax as
tax brackets will not be adjusted for inflation.
Exceptionally low interest rates will continue to
have a positive impact on public finances. Central
government expenditure is not expected to grow in
real terms in 2013 thanks to the system of
expenditure ceilings.
Central and local government finances will remain
in deficit over the forecast horizon and the surplus
of social security funds is expected to decrease due
to lower increases in income and lower returns on
investments. The general government deficit is
expected to be -1.7% of GDP in 2012. Thanks to
the adjustment measures taken by the government,
the deficit will decrease over the forecast horizon,
but is still expected to reach 1.3% of GDP in 2014.
The structural budget balance improves to -⅓% on
2013 but deteriorates slightly in 2014.
General government gross debt will continue to
grow and is expected to reach 57.6% of GDP by
2014.

For 2013, Finland has undertaken significant
adjustment measures to strengthen central

26. SWEDEN
From lacklustre growth towards a gradual recovery
Shifting to a lower gear in 2012

Following a brisk growth in 2010 and 2011, the
Swedish economy decelerated abruptly in late
2011 in the wake of the euro-area sovereign-debt
crisis and the global slowdown. Recession was
avoided since growth returned at a strong rate in
spring 2012, triggered by resilient household
consumption, investment as well as net exports. In
the first three quarters of 2012, GDP grew at an
average rate of about 0.6% per quarter. However,
the autumn of 2012 was marked with deteriorating
economic sentiment across all categories. It
became apparent that the shaky situation abroad
eventually sapped prospects for Sweden, too. The
economic sentiment index and the PMI fell to
levels seen in mid-2009 for the last time. This,
together with the weak underlying tendency in the
GDP composition in the third quarter (weak
exports and declining investment), suggests a
contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012, which
will set the scene for 2013.

grow by 1.3% in 2013. It should regain more
dynamism in 2014 when it is forecast to increase
by 2.7%, driven mainly by private consumption.
Looking more closely at the GDP components,
exports are suffering from the global slowdown
and a continued gradual appreciation of the
Swedish krona which accelerated in the summer of
2012. Export industries are struggling with low
demand, mainly from the EU which accounts for
more than 55% of Swedish exports. Exports are
expected to pick up in the second half of 2013
when growth in Swedish export markets is
projected to resume.
On the domestic side, investment is likely to lead
the recovery in 2013. Whereas companies have
been postponing their investment plans since
spring 2012, they are likely to push them ahead
once they see a credible revival in global growth.
Low investment levels in previous years also argue
for a likely strong pick-up in capital formation
once uncertainty subsides. Financing conditions
remain favourable, supported by three cuts in
policy rates in 2012 and a wide access to foreign
funding for Swedish banks. Household
consumption in the first half of 2013 is set to be
restrained by a deteriorating labour market and
uncertainties about the external environment.
Nevertheless, given high savings and decent real
income growth supported by low inflation, there is
a scope for more dynamic consumption in the
period ahead, starting in the second half of 2013.
Weak labour market and below-target inflation

Recovery expected in the second half of 2013
and solid dynamics in 2014

Growth is likely to bounce back to positive
numbers in the first quarter of 2013. Export orders
and industrial confidence are showing first signs of
recovery and also employment plans by companies
are turning more optimistic. However, growth is
expected to remain subdued for the rest of 2013 as
confidence among households and companies will
rise only gradually and external demand resumes
slowly. Investment and exports are likely to pick
up earlier while private consumption will follow
later in the year. Overall, real GDP is forecast to

84

The labour market in 2012 was marked by strong
growth in labour supply which was in the first
three quarters absorbed by robust employment
growth. However, with employment falling back in
the autumn, the unemployment rate jumped to
8.1% in November and averaged 7.7% in 2012.
Although the most recent hiring plans by
companies indicate a halt to pessimism, the
employment outlook remains bleak for the whole
year of 2013. The unemployment rate is forecast to
stay around 8% in 2013, before receding back to
7.8% in 2014.
Inflation has been hovering between 0.5 and 1% in
2012, being dampened by the strengthening
currency and low capacity utilisation. These

Member States, Sweden

factors are assumed to remain in place and,
together with the assumed decline in commodity
prices, are likely to keep inflation below the 2%
target until the end of the forecast period. Wage
pressures are also expected to remain low, as the
lacklustre profit situation in manufacturing and
weaker labour market will prevent higher wage
agreements in the upcoming bargaining round than
those concluded in the 2011-12 round (2.4%
increase over a year) and the wage drift is also
expected to be contained. With real interest rates
expected to stay close to zero throughout 2013,
inflation is forecast to pick up as economic activity
resumes in 2014.
Risks looming both on the inside and outside

The major short-term risk is a possible
entrenchment of pessimism among households and
companies. The strong krona is also taking a toll
on the prospects for recovery. To preserve
competitive prices and keep market shares,
exporters are cutting their prices in the domestic
currency which results in squeezed profit margins.
Unless higher gains in productivity or lower pay
increases are achieved, export prices will have to
increase, causing a competitiveness challenge. The
housing market and high private debt also remain a

threat to economic stability, although imminent
risks have subsided. While the bleak outlook and
some regulatory measures under consideration
could cool the housing market further, low interest
rates are likely to foster its stability.
Public finances: becoming a deficit country

The general government balance is forecast to
swing from a surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2011 to a
deficit of 0.2% of GDP in 2012, reflecting the
economic slowdown. Given the expansionary
budget and higher pension payments, it is likely to
deteriorate further in 2013 to a deficit of 0.9% of
GDP. The stimulus consisted mainly from the
corporate rate cut, infrastructure investment and
labour market measures. In 2014, the government
finances are set to improve, recording a deficit of
0.2% of GDP thanks to higher growth. The
worsening in the structural balance observed since
2009 is expected to continue until 2013 when the
structural surplus is estimated to drop to 0.1% of
GDP, before improving slightly to 0.3% in 2014.
The decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio is also
likely to continue, albeit at a slower pace. Planned
privatisation projects and renewed growth should
drag public debt down to 35½% of GDP in 2014.

85

27. THE UNITED KINGDOM
Green shoots on the horizon
Flat growth but prospects improving

The final quarter of 2012 posted negative growth
of -0.3% after it had rebounded by 0.9% in the
third. Overall, GDP has fallen in three of the four
quarters of 2012. The main cause of the final
quarter decline was the extraction industry, as
maintenance continued on the UK's biggest North
Sea oil field. Services growth was flat with the
construction sector growing marginally.

Investment remaining constrained

In 2012, investment again acted as a drag on
growth despite corporates being cash-rich and the
credit-easing measures announced by the Bank of
England and HM Treasury, namely the Funding
for Lending Scheme (FLS). Weak consumer
demand has dampened the appetite for investment.
Another factor that may be curtailing investment is
the fact that the price of capital is rising relative to
the price of labour where continuously low wage
growth props up the demand for labour.
Notwithstanding this trend, the forecast for 2013
and 2014 is for investment to grow as the FLS
reduces the cost of capital, uncertainty declines
further and the fact that investment will eventually
be necessary following negative growth in four of
the last five years.
A small change in the wind for net exports?

Overall, growth for the year was flat but had been
volatile with an extra bank holiday in the second
quarter dragging down growth and the London
Olympics in the third quarter propping it up. The
outlook remains somewhat subdued with the first
half of 2013 unlikely to see rapid growth in any of
the GDP components. Growth is forecast at 0.9%
in 2013 and 1.9% in 2014 due to gradually better
investment and consumption as uncertainty
continues to fall and wages start growing.
Weak but steady improvement in consumption

Quarterly consumption growth throughout 2012
has been continuously positive indicating that
consumers may be over the worst of the crisis;
employment continuing to be strong reinforces this
belief. Positive contributions to growth from
consumption are expected in 2013 and 2014 on a
slow but progressively improving basis, as
inflation falls more gradually than anticipated and
nominal wage growth remains weak. The main risk
to the forecast stems from a failure of consumption
growth to take hold, thereby also heightening the
uncertainty about investment expenditure.

86

Net exports contributed negatively to growth
overall in 2012 but a marginal improvement is
expected from 2013 onwards. Sterling continues to
remain at a relatively low value, thus the time may
have come where exporters now focus on gaining
market shares as opposed to propping up margins.
Tensions in the euro area, the UK's largest export
destination, have also declined and exports to nonEU countries have increased. Net exports are
forecast to contribute positively to growth by 0.2%
in 2013 and 0.6% in 2014.
Unemployment defies expectations

Unemployment has fallen continuously since the
last quarter of 2011 when it peaked at 8.4%. This
is contrary to what would be expected given the
fall in GDP growth. In the third quarter of 2012,
unemployment stood at 7.8%, relating to strong
labour growth in the business services and
consumer sectors. The employment rate stood at
70.5% in the third quarter of 2012.(30)
Despite these positive results, it is unlikely that the
unemployment rate can continue falling given the
poor growth outlook. Labour hoarding, an increase
in part-time work and self-employment account for
only some of this phenomenon. Given that the rate
of decline in unemployment is also falling, it may

Member States, The United Kingdom

have reached its trough. It is forecast to increase to
8.0% in 2013 before levelling off at 7.8% in 2014.
Inflation becoming sticky

Inflation had been falling almost continuously
since its 5.2% peak in September 2011 but has
now remained at 2.7% in each of the last three
months of 2012 and the first month of 2013.
Inflation had increased in October due to the
increase in university tuition fees in England and
utility prices kept it from falling in December.
Inflation has now been above the Bank of
England's target of 2% continuously for three
years. However, inflation is still expected to fall,
given weak demand but at a slower rate than
previously forecast. It is estimated at 2.6% in 2013
and 2.3% in 2014.
No change from consolidation plans

While the UK government sticks to its fiscal
consolidation strategy, borrowing in the financial
year to-date is higher than in the previous year
mainly due to weak corporate tax receipts, linked
to the temporary closure of the biggest oil field.

The deficit is estimated at 5.9% in 2012-13, at
7.0% in 2013-14 and 5.8% in 2014-15.(31) The
decline in the first year is due to a one-off transfer
of the Royal Mail pension fund worth 1.8 pps. and
the inclusion of an estimated GBP 3.5 billion from
the sale of 4G licences in early 2013. On the
current trajectory, the UK is unlikely to reach its
EDP deadline in 2014-15. The structural balance is
forecast at -6.2%, -5.5% and -4.6% over the same
period, respectively. Gross debt continues to
increase and is estimated to reach 95.5% in 201314 and 97.1% in 2014-15.

(31)

The estimates for deficit and debt do not take account of
the proposed transfer of the Bank of England's Asset
Purchase Facility as the statistical treatment has not been
specified by Eurostat. The Office for Budget Responsibility
(OBR) has estimated this as a 0.8 pp. reduction in the
deficit in 2012-13 and 2013-14 and a 0.7 pp. reduction in
2014-15 in their Economic and fiscal outlook published in
December 2012.

28. CROATIA
Staying in the economic doldrums
Continued recession in 2012

Croatia's annual real GDP fell significantly in
2012. In the third quarter output was 1.9% lower
year-on-year. Most of this was due to the
contraction in the winter of 2011/12 since
economic activity was essentially flat in the second
and third quarter (in seasonally-adjusted quarteron-quarter terms) much helped by a strong tourist
season which compensated for the declining
industrial production. The available data for the
fourth quarter suggest a renewed contraction of
economic activity. Most notable, the fall in
consumer spending re-accelerated to a 6.1% y-o-y
decline in real terms in December.

conditions remain unfavourable. Consumer and
business confidence are still subdued. There has
also been little progress in lowering deep-seated
structural obstacles to growth.

In line with output, the labour market deteriorated
further in 2012. The registered unemployment rate
was 2.4 pps. higher year-on-year in December. At
the same time, consumer price inflation has risen
markedly. The monthly year-on-year reading of
the overall CPI increased from 1.2% in January to
4.7% in December. Most of the higher inflation
rate was due to the VAT hike in March, increases
in administered prices and rising energy and food
prices generated by higher world prices and by the
extreme summer drought in the region. Core
inflation, as measured by the central bank, has
increased more moderately to 2.3% in October.
Croatia's long-standing current-account deficit
continued to narrow in 2012. The customary thirdquarter surplus was bolstered by tourism-related
services exports. Over the four quarters to endSeptember, the current-account deficit reached
0.6% of GDP.
Persistent obstacles to growth

The Croatian economy continues to face both
cyclical and structural headwinds. Contracting
economic activity in many EU Member States, not
least among some of Croatia's most important
trading partners, will continue to weigh on the
domestic economy in 2013. Croatia's international
competitiveness has been insufficient to prevent a
declining trend in the country's export market
share. Weak labour market conditions continue to
exert downward pressure on incomes and
spending. The high level of indebtedness of
households and companies and their need to
deleverage are curbing domestic demand. Credit

From contraction to sluggish upturn

Overall economic activity is expected to remain
suppressed in the first half of 2013 given the
international environment and the absence of
domestic sources of growth. Gradually, some
stimulus should materialise from governmentpromoted capital spending by state-owned
enterprises, particularly in the energy and transport
sectors. Private investments should be stimulated
by Croatia's accession to the EU on 1 July. In the
second half of the year, the more cyclical
headwinds from the external side should lessen,
allowing a modest acceleration in real exports.
Export growth is, however, projected to be below
the growth of export markets, implying a loss of
market share. In 2014, rising exports, in
combination with growing investments, will result
in increasing employment and incomes and,
ultimately, consumer spending. On the other hand,
it is expected that general government will detract
slightly from GDP growth. Imports should
accelerate more strongly than exports, not least
because investments have relatively high import
content in Croatia. This implies that net exports
will subtract from GDP growth already in 2013
after having provided an offset to faltering
domestic demand throughout the recession.
Overall, the upturn of economic activity is likely to
be very subdued.

Acceding Countries, Croatia

Modest growth in 2014

widen somewhat in the wake of rising investment
activity and the return to consumption growth.

The forecast projects that real GDP has shrunk by
1.9% in 2012. In the current year, the upturn in
investment and exports will still be insufficient to
offset the drag from continued declines in
consumer and government spending and rising
imports. The net result is projected to be a GDP
contraction of 0.4% in 2013. In the following year,
the balance of the various contributions to GDP
growth turns positive, resulting in annual GDP
growth of 1.0%. The risks to this growth forecast
are mainly on the downside and particularly
related to the lowering of Croatia's sovereign-debt
rating to the speculative grade by several rating
agencies, the risk of credit restraint as a result of
bank deleveraging, and the possibility of additional
expenditure cuts in public budgets.

Fiscal deficit likely to remain high

Fiscal policy has, to some extent, contained the
negative budgetary consequences of the recession
in 2012. General government expenditure
stabilised while revenues increased due to a VAT
rate-hike, other tax measures, and improving tax
compliance. Consequently, the fiscal deficit is
projected to have shrunk to 4.6% of GDP. The
2013 state budget plans to increase expenditure by
3.5% y-o-y. On this basis and in view of the
macroeconomic projections, the fiscal deficit of
general government is projected to widen again to
5.0% of GDP in 2013. In the following year, the
upturn of economic activity should help to narrow
the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP.

Reflecting the GDP growth path, employment will
continue to fall in 2013 before starting to increase
in the following year. Consumer price inflation is
projected to remain relatively elevated at 3% in
2013 due to a high carry-over effect, further
increases in administered prices, and some VAT
adjustments in connection with EU accession. In
2014 the inflation rate is forecast to decline to
around 2%. The current-account deficit should

The re-attribution of the debt of state-owned
shipyards to the government accounts raised
general government debt extraordinarily in 2012.
Given the persistent fiscal deficits, the debt ratio is
projected to continue its steady increase and to
reach 60% of GDP in 2014.

Recovering after the double-dip?
Turkey

Real GDP growth slowed steadily from 11.9% in
the year to the first quarter of 2011 to 2.6% in the
nine months of 2012 (year-on-year). Short-term
indicators suggest that, chiefly as a result of the
monetary easing observed in the second half of
2012, domestic demand started accelerating in the
final months of 2012. GDP growth is forecast to
remain almost constant in 2013 rise slightly but
gradually to respectively 3.0% in 2013 and 3.8% in
2014.
Private consumption growth has slowed sharply in
2012, owing to a strong base effect from the 2011
spending surge, slower employment growth,
decelerating credit growth and the impact of a
weaker lira on demand for imported consumer
goods. Under the assumptions that the exchange
rate of the lira stabilises, monetary policy is not
tightened and consumer confidence continues
rising, private consumption growth should pick up
from - 0.6% in 2012 to 3.8% in 2013 and 4.8% in
2014. In tandem, public consumption growth is
accelerating from 5.3% in 2012 to 6.5% in 2013
and 7.6% in 2014, an election year.
The government deficit is expected to rise as
higher cyclical revenues cannot mitigate swelling
spending pressures. Gross fixed investment growth
turned negative in 2012 due to base effects and
lower external and domestic demand growth, but it
should pick up again in 2013-14 as business
sentiment improves.
Net exports grew faster than expected in 2012, as
evidenced by the weakness of import demand and
the strength in export growth in the first three
quarters of 2012. Recent high frequency indicators
suggest that domestic demand is again increasingly
driving growth. Hence, import growth (goods and
services) is likely to outpace export growth in 2013
and 2014. Risks are skewed to the upside, with the
possibility that over-exuberance in the financial
markets may spill over into faster demand growth.
But this could be a concern for the long term, as
with the authorities seemingly keen to pursue
expansionary policies, inflation could accelerate
again and the current-account deficit widen more
sharply than expected. Weakening economic
activity could increase the government's desire to

94

maintain some flexibility in its management of the
public accounts, in particular in 2013 and 2014, in
order to support growth in output and jobs, in so
far as it is able to do so without damaging investor
confidence.
The deficit of the general government is expected
to edge up from 1.9% of GDP in 2012 to 2.6% of
GDP in 2013 and 3.1% of GDP in 2014. The
government debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
decline from 39.1% of GDP at end-2011 to just
over 34.2% by 2014, reflecting moderate primary
surpluses, a scheduled pick-up in privatisation and
accelerating economic growth in 2014.
On the back of positive base effects and food
prices developments in the final months of 2012,
inflation slowed to 6.2% at the end of 2012.

In part as a result of hikes in administrative prices
and taxes, CPI inflation is expected to rise
temporarily in 2013, before easing to 5.6% in
2014. Central Bank inflation targets have been
kept at 5% ±2 pps. both for 2013 and 2014.
Driven by a credit-fuelled rise in import demand
and higher oil prices, the current-account deficit
reached 10% of GDP in 2011. As from 2013,
imports
will
increasingly
benefit
from
reinvigorating domestic demand. Nevertheless, the
current-account deficit is expected to go up to
6.6% of GDP and 7.5% of GDP in 2013 and 2014
respectively. Tourism revenue and expenditure
data are currently being revised upwards, which
may prompt a downward revision of the currentaccount deficit.

Latest data points to lower-than-expected
dynamics in economic activity, probably resulting
from persistently high inflation and the continued
uncertain global outlook. Weakening domestic
demand will lead to slightly lower growth in 2013,
while the completion of engergy-related
investment projects will support stronger growth in
2014. The positive labour market trend is likely to
continue. Entrenched inflationary expectations risk
to keep price increases rather high. Supported by
solid GDP growth, fiscal adjustment is likely to
continue, resulting in a slight fiscal surplus by
2014. This profile implies substantial primary
surpluses, which will help reducing public debt.

In 2012, the economy stagnated, postponing the
onset of the recovery. Private consumption
remained the main source of growth although
offset by the negative contribution from net
exports as a result of a sharp decline of industrial
production. In 2013, tax increases will have a
negative impact on domestic demand. Yet, the
recovery of credit activity or the opening of some
large investments before end-2013 represent
upside risks. Inflation should moderate once the
effect of several administrative price hikes in 2012
fades out, while labour market remains lethargic.
Fiscal consolidation will support the stabilisation
and later reduction in public debt.

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

Serbia

During 2012, economic deceleration was sharper
than expected. In 2013, investment and exports are
likely to be the main sources of growth, although
the high import content of investment reduces the
immediate impact on growth. The high share of
structural unemployment will limit the response of
unemployment to stronger growth. Inflationary
pressures are expected to remain low. In
September 2012, the government raised the deficit
target for 2012 from 2½% of GDP to 3½%, mainly
due to underperforming revenues. A similar deficit
is expected in 2013, that will remain above 3%
also in 2014, reflecting higher transfers and
investment.

Serbia's economy remained in recession in the last
quarter of 2012. A mild recovery is expected in
2013, underpinned by strong exports growth, while
domestic demand is likely to be subdued due to
fiscal consolidation efforts, structural bottlenecks
and stagnant employment creation. The trade
deficit is set to fall in 2013 but weaker net transfers
and worsening income balance would keep the
current-account deficit high. Inflation is expected
to remain elevated in the short term, fuelled by
corrections in administered prices and increased
indirect taxation. The budget deficit is foreseen to
fall significantly in 2013 but expenditure pressures
are likely due to sluggish growth and a weak
labour market.

30. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Growth restrained by fiscal uncertainties
Subdued growth continues

The US is forecast to continue to grow at a sub-par
pace over the forecast horizon amid fiscal
tightening and looming policy uncertainties.
Growth in 2013 is revised down to 1.9% (from
2.3% in the autumn) reflecting the expectation of a
higher fiscal restraint and a lower-than-expected
carry-over from 2012 due to the weak first
estimate for the final quarter of 2012. The forecast
for 2014 remains unchanged at 2.6%.
Real GDP unexpectedly shrank by 0.04% q-o-q in
the fourth quarter of 2012, dragged down by a
sharp cutback in government defence spending and
a heavy inventory drawdown, which subtracted
0.3 pp. each from the quarterly growth rate. The
first negative quarterly GDP headline reading since
2009 followed a solid 0.8% growth in the third
quarter and is likely to be revised up in the second
estimate as the December foreign trade data turned
out were more growth supportive than assumed.

1.6% in the fourth quarter, likely due to some
income and capital gains being brought forward in
anticipation of 2013 tax increases. Despite fiscal
cliff concerns, business investment rebounded by
2.0% in the fourth quarter after slipping 0.5% in
the third, while residential investment continued to
recover (3.6% after 3.2% in the previous quarter).
Job creation picked up sharply in the fourth quarter
to 201,000 (vs. 168,000 in the third quarter,
monthly average) and remained relatively strong in
January. The unemployment rate fell slightly in the
second half of 2012, from just above 8% to 7.9%
in January 2013, along with the share of long-term
unemployment which dropped to 38.1% in
December, a three-year low. However, the activity
rate remained near a three-decade low in January
(63.6%), signalling a structural dimension to the
current labour market weakness.
The recovery in the housing sector has been one of
the strongest growth drivers in 2012. Residential
investment has added to GDP growth for seven
quarters now. At 0.3 pp., the contribution in 2012
is the biggest since 2005. Home prices (CaseShiller 20-city Index, s.a.) have been rising for ten
straight months to November 2012 – the longest
such stretch since early 2006 – and are now 6%
higher than the trough in February 2012. Both
construction activity and home sales continue to
rise robustly with the 3-month momentum of
housing starts in December at its highest since
mid-2008.
Monetary policy supports recovery

Beyond highly volatile inventory and defence
spending components that boosted growth in the
third and depressed it in the fourth quarter, the
broad economy measured by final sales remained
on a weak but steady recovery path of 0.3-0.6%
q-o-q throughout 2012. Private consumption was
among the most stable components, expanding by
0.4% and 0.5% in the third and fourth quarter,
respectively, on the back of improving housing
market, solid job creation and ample stock market
gains. Disposable income growth accelerated to

98

Monetary policy remained loose, with the Fed's
December meeting bringing two important policy
changes. Operation Twist – which expired as
planned at the end of 2012 – was replaced by the
commitment to purchase longer-term Treasury
securities, initially at a pace of USD 45 billion per
month. In line with its new communication
strategy, the Fed announced its commitment to
keep the federal funds' rate at an exceptionally low
level (0-¼%), "at least as long as the
unemployment rate remains above 6.5%, inflation
between one and two years ahead is projected to be
no more than 0.5 pp. above the Committee’s 2%
longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation
expectations continue to be well anchored."

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

Fiscal outlook remains highly uncertain

The outlook for 2013 and 2014 is clouded by the
uncertainty regarding fiscal policies going forward.
A last-minute agreement helped avert some of the
tax rises and spending cuts from January 2,
2013.(32) However, uncertainty remains as the
automatic spending cuts (the "sequester") have
only been postponed until 1 March, and the
government financing based on continuing
resolution expires in late March. Moreover, the
looming debt ceiling problem has been deferred
rather than addressed by the bill passed in late
January authorizing an increase in the debt limit by
the amount of borrowing needed until 19 May.
Upcoming negotiations can unsettle markets and
take a toll on investor, business and consumer
confidence – as they did in the summer of 2011.
The forecast for 2013 was revised down to 1.9%
(from 2.3% in the autumn forecast) due to the
higher-than-expected fiscal restraint and a lowerthan-expected carry-over from 2012. A higher
consolidation – assumed now at around 1.9% of
GDP (vs. 1.2% in the autumn forecast) – results
(32)

Income taxes rose for households earning over USD
450,00, payroll taxes – for all employees, while emergency
unemployment benefits were extended for one year.

from the tax rises set out in the fiscal cliff deal
combined with the likely impact of agreements on
the sequester, government financing and the debt
ceiling. While the baseline assumption is that the
financing of the government will be secured, the
related deals are likely to entail additional
spending cuts that will affect defence, non-defence
and entitlement programmes.
This upcoming fiscal tightening will restrain
disposable incomes and thus keep growth of
personal consumption expenditure (accounting for
roughly 70% of GDP) subdued, at 1.5% in 2013,
the weakest since 2009. On the other hand, both
residential and business investment are expected to
remain resilient and continue expanding, driven by
the improving outlook, and rising property prices.
Uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook remains
the biggest risk factor for the forecast. Should a
damaging political stand-off over fiscal policies be
repeated, this will inevitably weigh heavily on
confidence,
investment
and
consumption.
Conversely, positive signals from negotiations will
increase the chances of addressing adequately
short-term fiscal concerns and make the US fiscal
position less untenable – thus providing a strong
boost to sentiment and growth going forward.

31. JAPAN
Near-term growth expected but long-term challenges remain
After a strong economic growth in the first quarter
of 2012 (1.5% q-o-q), economic activity started to
contract and GDP fell by 0.1% (q-o-q) in the
fourth quarter of 2012, the third consecutive
decline. In 2012 as a whole, activity expanded by
1.9% due to the good performance of early 2012.
Front-loading of fiscal expenditure will offset the
recent slowdown and sustain annual growth in
2013 (revised up to 1.0% from 0.8% in the autumn
forecast). Fiscal expansion will gradually
decelerate in 2014, and private consumption will
be dampened by the tax hike due in April 2014.
Growth for 2014 is revised marginally down to
1.6% from 1.9%.

Net exports experienced a sharp decline in 2012 on
the back of falling exports to the EU and China
and sustained energy imports. Weak export
demand tipped the trade balance with the EU into
negative territory, whereas diplomatic tensions
resulted in a further widening of the trade deficit
with China. Fossil fuel imports, which accounted
for 34% of the value of total imports at the end of
2012, increased faster after nuclear power plants
were shut down in the aftermath of the Fukushima
disaster, and remain a persistent downward
pressure. As a result Japan's trade deficit widened
by 160% to JPY 6.9 tn (EUR 60.3 bn) in 2012,
whereas the non-energy trade balance remains
positive but on a downward trend.

Recent signs of fatigue…

Private consumption, which accounts for around
60% of Japanese GDP, was stagnant at 0.0% in the
second quarter, declined by 0.5% q-o-q in the third
quarter, and increased by 0.4% q-o-q in the fourth
quarter. The unemployment rate declined from
4.5% in December 2011 to 4.2% in December
2012, but nominal wage growth has turned
negative (-1.4% y-o-y in December) and is
declining faster than the CPI. The employment rate
has remained broadly stable (56.1% in December
2012 against 56.4% in December 2011), but the
marginal replacement of regular employees (2.0%
y-o-y in December) with part-time workers (0.1%
y-o-y in December) further adds to downward
pressures on income and private consumption. The
seasonally-adjusted retail sales index grew by
0.8% m-o-m in October but remained stagnant
over the last two months of 2012.
Private non-residential fixed investment remained
weak in the last quarter of 2012 due to domestic
political uncertainty and subdued external demand.
After declining 0.2% q-o-q and 3.6% q-o-q in the
second and third quarter respectively, it fell by
2.6% q-o-q in the fourth quarter as deteriorating
business sentiment led to investment decisions
being put on hold.
After a negative performance in the first quarter
(-1.7% q-o-q), private residential fixed investment
rebounded in the second (2.2% q-o-q) and third
(1.6% q-o-q) quarter. This trend continued into the
last quarter of 2012, with an increase of
3.5% q-o-q.

100

Government consumption and investment recorded
positive growth in each quarter in 2012, and
successive budgetary measures suggest further
expansion in 2013.
…expected to dissipate after stimulus kicks in

A front-loading of fiscal expenditure from a
JPY 10.3 tn (EUR 88 bn) stimulus package
adopted by the new government is expected to
provide a near-term impulse to growth in 2013
mainly from public investment into large
infrastructure works. Recent surveys suggest an
improvement in business sentiment in both the
manufacturing and non-manufacturing sector on
the back of expectations for more favourable
external conditions, government stimulus, and a
rebound in private consumption and corporate
investment. The recently approved budget for the
fiscal year 2013 will also provide further

Other non-EU Countries, Japan

momentum for growth through additional
infrastructure and reconstruction spending. Net
exports are expected to gradually rebound, as the
sharp depreciation of the yen, the easing of
tensions with China and a pick-up in global
demand will provide a more benign external
environment.
Deflationary pressures persisted. The Consumer
Price Index has been on a downward trend since
June 2012 and ended the year with a 0.1% y-o-y
decline.
Deflationary pressures should gradually ease over
the forecast horizon as looser monetary policy by
the Bank of Japan (which has now set a 2%
inflation target), and the weaker yen will exert
upward pressure, further reinforced by the
consumption tax hike from 5% to 8% due in April
2014.
But long-term challenges loom on the horizon

intends to achieve the current fiscal objective of a
primary balance surplus by fiscal year 2020.
Maintaining the consumption tax hikes from 5% to
8% and 10% foreseen for 2014 and 2015 will be a
first essential step in this direction. If the higher
inflation target was to be anchored into inflation
expectations, rising yields on JGBs may put an
additional strain on Japan's public finances.
Dependency on fossil fuel imports is not likely to
dissipate in the near-term, as the focus of energy
policy has shifted to a renewed interest in nuclear
power generation, which may however take time to
materialise into concrete policy actions that would
alleviate the impact of the energy bill and offset
somewhat the depreciation of the yen.
In the medium to long term the rapid population
ageing will put a strain on growth and public
finances. Therefore structural reforms to sustain
labour supply and investment will be essential to
raise potential growth.

Looking ahead, fiscal consolidation will remain a
priority for the coming years if the government

32. CHINA
Growth picks up and rebalancing makes some headway
An improved domestic outlook

Soft landing in sight

China's economy appears to have turned a corner
in late 2012 and risks of a hard landing have
receded. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2012
showed a modest bounce back to 7.9% (y-o-y),
compared to 7.4% (y-o-y) in the previous quarter,
bringing growth for the whole 2012 to 7.8%. This
improvement reflected a sharp increase in net
exports, resilient domestic consumption, and a
stabilisation of investment demand due to an
acceleration of public infrastructure spending. The
outlook is for a modest increase in growth in 2013
and 2014.

A subdued external environment

The revived growth of exports in the last quarter of
2012 together with subdued import growth led
China to report a current-account surplus of 2.8%
of GDP in 2012, compared to 2.6% in 2011. China
has compensated for the slowdown in exports to
Europe, India and Taiwan via increases in exports
to other Asian markets and Latin America.
The real effective exchange rate has remained
roughly stable over the last twelve months
following a modest appreciation in 2011,
providing some support to export industries.
Nevertheless, growth in China's principal export
markets is expected to remain weak in 2013 and
regional growth in Asia is expected to accelerate
only modestly, suggesting that the external
environment will remain a drag on growth.

102

Domestic consumption proved relatively resilient
during the course of 2012. Retail sales picked up
steadily in the second half of the year and the yearon-year growth rate rose from a low of 13.1% (in
nominal terms) in July to 15.2% in December.
Consumption is expected to remain a key driver of
growth into 2013, underpinned by three factors.
Firstly, average domestic wage growth is
outstripping productivity growth. Secondly, real
interest rates have remained positive as inflation
remains relatively low, boosting household income
from deposit holdings. Thirdly, recent expansion
of the domestic social security safety net may have
some impact on prudential savings.
Investment fell sharply in the first half of 2012,
following a tightening of monetary policy in 2011
and implementation of sector-level measures
directed at deflating a real-estate bubble. Policy
interest rates were subsequently lowered in mid2012 and approvals of public infrastructure
spending were accelerated. Investment stabilised at
a lower rate of growth in the second half of the
year. The bringing forward of public infrastructure
spending is likely to be a relatively temporary
boost to investment. Aggregate investment is
however expected to maintain a steady growth rate
over the forecast horizon, underpinned by a
relatively accommodative monetary policy.
The downward movement in policy interest rates
in 2012 comprised only 50 basis points, but interbank rates have seen greater movement, dropping
from around 5.5% at the turn of the year to under
4% in December 2012. Aggregate credit growth
(total social financing) picked up gradually during
the course of the year after slumping in late 2011
and early 2012. Inflation is expected to show a
moderate increase over the forecast horizon, but
there is as yet no sign of significant price
pressures, so monetary policy is likely to remain
supportive of growth in the short term.
Is the Chinese economy rebalancing?

Growth in consumption in 2012 outstripped
growth in investment, reversing the pattern of the
past decade. Moreover, disposable incomes are

Other non-EU Countries, China

rising faster than GDP. These are signs the internal
"rebalancing" of the Chinese economy is
advancing. Investment remains the largest
component of GDP however, and further
rebalancing will be needed if China is to manage
the transition towards a less capital and resource
intensive form of development.
Risks to the outlook

China is exposed to downside risks from the global
economic environment, but the most critical risk
factors remain domestic. On the positive side, risks
linked to a sharp slowdown in the housing market
appear to have receded and real estate investment
has stabilised. House price bubbles appear to have
been quite localised and knock-on effects limited.
It has become clearer though that the process of
rebalancing itself generates a set of interrelated
risks. If China rebalances too slowly and continues
to devote a very heavy proportion of GDP to
investment then problems will continue to
accumulate linked to "over-investment". These
include rising bad debts, falling profitability, and
an eventual abrupt correction. On the other hand,
the process of rebalancing itself requires that
household incomes grow faster than GDP, with a
corresponding squeeze on corporate profits. With

inflation also likely to remain moderate, slower
growth of nominal GDP could translate into cashflow problems for highly leveraged firms.
A key challenge therefore will be to manage the
articulation between investment and consumption,
to ensure that a gradual reduction in the weight of
investment does not simply translate into lower
overall growth and profitability but is offset by
rising consumer expenditure. This will require
additional policy measures to further stimulate
consumption, modernise the distribution sector,
and raise expectation of the long-term growth in
disposable income. On the 6th of February the
Chinese State Council issued a plan to tackle rising
income inequality which sets a number of the longterm goals. If successfully implemented this plan
could have an important impact on internal
rebalancing.
The central risk factor over the forecast horizon
therefore is whether the Chinese authorities are
able to continue to effect a smooth rotation of
demand while avoiding excessive stress in fragile
sectors. This will be a key challenge for the new
government that takes office in March, following
on from the change in Communist Party leadership
in November 2012.

33. RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Commodity-fuelled growth with modernisation pending
Russia recovered well from the global economic
crisis on the back of sustained high commodity
prices in international markets, posting real GDP
growth of 4.3% in 2011. Since then, however, the
pace of growth has weakened considerably,
posting a rate of 3.4% in 2012, due in part to
weaker global activity. As the authorities attempt
to diversify away from heavy dependence on oil
exports, Russia is still projected to grow close to
its estimated potential at 3.7% in 2013 and 3.9% in
2014.

respectively). As a result, the trade surplus is
projected to decrease to 9.5% in 2012, from 10.7%
of GDP in 2011 and net exports continue to
contribute negatively to economic growth.
Sustained high income outflows mean that the
current-account surplus will be limited to 3.9% of
GDP, down from 5.4% in the previous year.
Exports of oil and gas account for some 70% of
goods exports, and the non-oil trade deficit
remains high at around 7.5% of GDP.

Steady decline in growth rates throughout 2012

During the course of 2012, annual GDP growth of
4.9% in the first quarter moderated to 4.0% in the
second quarter and 2.9% in the third quarter. For
the year 2012, growth is reported at 3.4%,
implying a further significant slow-down in the
fourth quarter. While household consumption
remained the most important driver of growth at an
annual growth rate of 6.6% in spite of weaker real
wage growth, government consumption was flat
and investment slowed considerably, to 6% from a
previously very strong performance. In line with
gross fixed capital formation, industrial production
growth decelerated steadily in 2012, down to 2.4%
in the fourth quarter. Despite this slowing, the
unemployment rate decreased in the first half of
the year, and has since stayed at low levels,
standing at 5.3% in December.
Trade growth decelerated with unchanged
composition

The growth of imports of goods and services
exceeded by far that of exports (8.7% and 1.8%,

104

After contracting in volumes and growing in
values during most of 2011, export values of crude
oil and oil products increased slightly in 2012 on
roughly stable prices. Exports of natural gas
contracted in the first half of 2012 in both values
and volumes before recovering somewhat in the
fourth quarter, resulting in a small annual
contraction in 2012. This reflects lower demand
from Russia's main trading partners due to
persisting economic difficulties, but may also
indicate the onset of structural demand shifts in the
gas market due to the development of shale gas.
Inflation above target range

In 2012, headline inflation remained subdued in
the first half of the year, but picked up in the
second half of the year, to 6.6% y-o-y, partly on
the back of a hike in food prices caused by the
summer drought in Russia. It thus missed the
Central Bank of Russia's inflation target range of
5-6%, despite some limited monetary tightening as
the benchmark refinancing rate was raised by 25
bps to 8.25% in September.

Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation

On fiscal policy, in 2011 the Russian federal
budget was in surplus for the first time since 2008.
It remained in surplus throughout most of 2012
and is expected to close near balance, although the
non-oil budget deficit widened considerably, to
around 11% of GDP.

2014, close to growth potential as estimated by
both Russian authorities and independent
institutions. Present trends are largely set to
continue, with household consumption growth
moderating somewhat, and public consumption
contributing only to a limited extent to economic
growth. Export volumes are expected to increase at
a faster pace in 2013 (4% y-o-y) and 2014 (5.3%
y-o-y), reflecting improvements in the global
economic outlook, while imports will grow below
trend, partly as a result of a less accommodative
fiscal stance. The negative contribution of net
exports is thus set to lessen over the forecast
horizon. Given the commodity price assumptions
of this forecast, the crucial component of domestic
demand growth over the next years is expected to
be investment. The expected global recovery
should underpin prices in the near term, but
potential structural challenges to the continued
reliance on oil and gas revenues have already
resulted in the withdrawal of investment plans, and
this effect is set to strengthen this year and next. A
lack of concrete measures to improve the business
environment, diversify and modernise the
economy is therefore a downside risk to our
growth forecast.

Looking ahead

In December 2012, the Finance Ministry's proposal
for the new federal budget for the period 2013-15
was signed into law. Effective from January 2013,
this budget incorporates a newly instated rule
linking expenditure to long-term oil prices that
should result in further fiscal consolidation and a
progressive, albeit slow, reduction in non-oil
deficits. The budget also aims at lowering the nonoil budget deficit gradually over the forecast
horizon. While current policy priorities are largely
maintained, the aim of containing federal deficits
is predicated on significant tasks effectively being
taken over by the regional administrative level.
Despite the recent slowdown and weak readings of
leading indicators such as the PMI, the Russian
economy is forecast to continue on a moderate
growth path, at a rate of 3.7% in 2013 and 3.9% in

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fullyfledged economic forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn.
These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic
aggregates for the Member States, the candidate countries,
the European Union as a whole, the euro area and the
international environment.
2. Data for 2012, 2013 and 2014 are forecasts.
The source for all tables is the European Commission,
unless otherwise stated.
Historical data for the Member States are based on the European
System of Accounting (ESA 1995). Most Member States have
now introduced chain-linking in their national accounts to measure
the development of economic aggregates in volume terms.
For the USA and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4. In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for USA
and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 1996.
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment
and the NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 22-26, 28 and 32-33 are based on
full-time-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France
Italy, the Netherlands and Austria report FTE data. In the
absence of FTE data, employment is based on numbers of persons.
In the calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates, priority is given to
FTE data, as this is regarded as more representative of diverse
patterns of working time.
7. EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates.
World GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS).
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the
aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates.
Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area "adjusted"
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-à-vis

third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of
the individual countries in the EU or the euro area. However,
intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of
reporting errors. The creation of the internal market in 1993
reduced border controls and formalities, and accordingly the
scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage. Typically,
intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU exports,
leading to an overestimation of the surplus. For the past the
"adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB
estimates for the euro area. For the future, they are ECFIN's
forecasts based on the extrapolation of the discrepancies
observed in 2011.
8. With respect to the 12 RAMS (recently-acceded Member States),
which are currently in a transition phase, the quality of statistical
data may not always be directly comparable to most EU15
Member States.
9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA17 (BE,DE,EE,IE,EL,ES,FR,IT,CY,LU,MT,NL,AT,PT,SI,SK,FI)
Acceding countries :
Croatia.
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Iceland, Montenegro and Serbia.
Potential candidates :
Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.
Asia :
All countries in that region except Japan and
the Asian MENA countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA countries.
