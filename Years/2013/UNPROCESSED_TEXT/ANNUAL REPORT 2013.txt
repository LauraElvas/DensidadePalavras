in a challenging environment characterised 

by ongoing, albeit moderating, financial 

fragmentation in the euro area. Underlying price 

pressures receded further amid broad-based 

economic weakness and continued subdued 

monetary dynamics. At the same time, medium to 

longer-term inflation expectations remained firmly 

anchored in line with the Governing Council™s aim 

of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% 

over the medium term, confirming the credibility 

of the ECB™s monetary policy strategy. 
Over the course of 2013 the euro area economy emerged from recession as a result of a gradual 
revival in domestic demand Œ supported by an 
accommodative monetary policy stance as well 

as by improving economic and financial market 

sentiment Œ and stronger foreign demand. 

However, the ongoing process of balance 
sheet adjustment in the public and private 

sector and high unemployment continued to 

dampen economic activity. Inflation declined 

perceptibly throughout 2013, reflecting, in 
particular, receding contributions from energy and food prices, as well as weaker underlying price 

pressures. On average, inflation stood at 1.4% in 2013, after 2.5% in 2012. The underlying pace of 

monetary growth remained subdued and loan growth continued to decline, mainly on account of 

weak credit demand, although adverse factors weighing on credit supply also played a role. In the 

light of a weaker inflation outlook extending into the medium term, the Governing Council lowered 

key ECB interest rates in May and again in November, reducing the rate on the main refinancing 

operations to 0.25%. Throughout the first half of 2013 euro area money market interest rates displayed significant volatility. Money market interest rates, in particular at the longer end of the term structure, rose 

markedly towards mid-2013, reflecting shifting expectations regarding future monetary policy 

and spillovers from developments outside the euro area. In order to anchor market expectations of 

interest rates more firmly around a path warranted by the outlook for price stability over the medium 

term, the Governing Council provided forward guidance in July, announcing that it expected the 

key ECB interest rates to remain at their prevailing or lower levels for an extended period of time. 

This message was confirmed over the remainder of the year, notably in the context of the November 

interest rate cut. In November the Governing Council decided that the Eurosystem would continue 

to provide liquidity to banks through fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment until at least 

mid-2015.Financing conditions improved in 2013 amid an abating sovereign debt crisis on account of further 
fiscal consolidation, a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances particularly in vulnerable euro area 

countries, improved EMU governance and progress towards banking union. However, financial 

fragmentation along national borders persisted, particularly in credit markets. To ensure that 

monetary policy decisions are adequately transmitted to the real economy in euro area countries, it 
FOREWORD8ECBAnnual Report
2013is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience 
of banks is strengthened where needed. This confidence-building process will be enhanced by the 

comprehensive balance sheet assessment conducted by the ECB before it adopts its supervisory 

role under the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Further decisive steps by governments to establish 
banking union will help to restore confidence in the financial system.Euro area countries continued to make progress with fiscal consolidation in 2013. The average 
government deficit is expected to have declined to around 3% of GDP, after 3.7% in 2012. With the 

entry into force of the ﬁtwo-packﬂ regulations in May 2013, the euro area governance framework 

was strengthened further. Euro area governments are now required to submit their draft budgetary 

plans to the European Commission each autumn for a review of their compliance with the EU fiscal 

rules. This obligation greatly enhances transparency and aligns the European surveillance calendar 

more closely with national budgetary procedures. In its review of the submitted draft budgetary 

plans in October, the Commission found most plans to be at least broadly compliant with the fiscal 

rules. However, it identified a risk of non-compliance for some countries and invited the respective 

authorities to adopt additional measures to ensure full compliance. Looking ahead, it will be important not to unravel past efforts but to sustain fiscal consolidation 
over the medium term, not least because general government debt-to-GDP ratios remain at 

high levels. Fiscal strategies should be in line with the fiscal compact. They should ensure 
 growth-friendly consolidation which combines improving the quality and efficiency of public 

services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. Governments also need to push ahead 

with product and labour market reforms, in order to improve competitiveness, raise potential 

growth, generate employment opportunities and foster the adaptability of the euro area.Market tensions continued to recede in the course of 2013, in an environment of improved investor 
confidence and easing funding conditions for euro area banks and sovereigns. In particular, excess 

liquidity in the banking system declined owing to repayments by various Eurosystem monetary 

policy counterparties of part or all of the amounts that they had borrowed in the three-year  longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) conducted in late 2011 and early 2012. The option of 

early repayment was first made available to the banks in January 2013, and they made extensive 

use of this possibility over the course of the year. These early repayments marked a shift in the 
banking system™s demand for liquidity buffers, which by the end of 2013 had returned to levels 

last seen in autumn 2011, before the allotment of the first three-year LTRO. The Eurosystem™s 

stock of securities held for monetary policy purposes declined during the year owing to 
 redemptions and to the absence of additional purchases. Moreover, in 2013 the Governing Council 

took various decisions related to the collateral which is eligible for use in monetary policy 

operations. In particular, the eligibility criteria were adjusted and the risk control framework was 

further strengthened. Turning to financial stability developments, against the background of a challenging but improving 
macroeconomic environment, euro area financial sector stress remained moderate in 2013. 

Advances made on the regulatory front contributed to the building-up of higher capital and liquidity 

buffers in the banking sector, enhancing the banking system™s shock-absorption capacity and 

weakening the adverse feedback loops between banks and sovereigns. The financial performance of large banking groups in the euro area remained subdued in the 
first three quarters of 2013, hampered by sluggish revenue growth and still elevated loan loss 

provisioning charges, which appear to be closely linked to the economic cycle and have been 
9ECBAnnual Report2013particularly pronounced for banks in stressed countries. Despite relatively weak profitability, 
 euro area banks have continued to steadily strengthen their capital positions. These improvements 
by euro area banks have been achieved through a combination of capital increases and reductions 

in risk-weighted assets, with the relative contribution of these two factors varying greatly across 

banking groups. Conditions in bank funding markets improved, but fragmentation remains. Euro area banks™ 
issuance of both senior unsecured and covered bonds remained below 2012 levels, even though 

average bank funding costs reached their lowest level for more than three years across all major 

debt instruments in early October. The funding situation of banks benefited from continued deposit 

inflows in most countries, including some reversal of the fragmentation that had previously exerted 

a negative effect on deposits in some countries under stress. Moreover, banks in most stressed 

countries continued to reduce their dependence on central bank funding.Notwithstanding these advances, ongoing efforts are needed to remove the risk of further negative interactions, at the country level, among stressed sovereigns, diverging economic growth prospects 

and bank fragility. Further progress towards establishing banking union will make an important 

contribution to overcoming these hurdles. A major step towards enhancing the resilience of the financial system in the EU was taken in 2013 
with the implementation of the new international standards of the Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision on capital and liquidity (Basel III) in the EU through the Capital Requirements 

Regulation and Directive (CRR/CRD IV). The provisions of the Regulation are directly applicable 

in all Member States as of 1 January 2014. They form a ﬁsingle rulebookﬂ for financial regulation 

and supervision across the EU, thus ensuring equal regulatory treatment of institutions providing 

financial services in the Single Market and enhancing financial integration in Europe. The Single 

Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will also rely on the single rulebook, which will ensure the 

harmonised application of rules within the euro area and in other Member States participating in the 

SSM. The SSM will become operational in November 2014.The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) will be the next step towards banking union. 
 The European Commission proposed legislation in July 2013 which foresees a single European 
authority and a single bank resolution fund for all EU Member States that participate in banking 

union. The entry into force of the regulation is envisaged in mid-2014, and the SRM should become 

fully operational from 2015. The SSM together with the SRM will help to break the link between banks and sovereigns in 
participating Member States and reverse the current process of financial market fragmentation.An effective SRM also requires a comprehensive set of enforceable tools and powers, as 
provided for in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), on which agreement was 

reached between the European Parliament, EU Member States and the European Commission on 

12 December 2013. The BRRD is expected to enter into force in 2015, and the bail-in tool will be 
effective as of 1 January 2016 at the latest. In 2013 the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the EU body responsible for the 
 macro-prudential oversight of the EU financial system, devoted significant resources to 
further developing the macro-prudential policy framework, resulting in particular in the ESRB 

Recommendation on intermediate objectives and instruments of macro-prudential policy of 
10ECBAnnual Report
20134 April 2013. The introduction of the CRR/CRD IV regulatory package for the EU banking sector 
also called for a series of preparatory and implementing measures by the ESRB, which were 
carried out in cooperation with ESRB members. In July 2013 the ESRB published a handbook on 

the follow-up to its recommendations, which was first used to assess the implementation of the 

ESRB Recommendation on lending in foreign currencies. The results of the assessment showed 

that Member States had complied well with the Recommendation. Furthermore, the review of the 

European System of Financial Supervision (which includes the ESRB) is ongoing.In the area of payment systems and financial market infrastructures, the ECB continued to 
contribute to the key policy and regulatory initiatives aimed at enhancing the stability of market 

infrastructures, including legislative initiatives at the EU level. The ECB also contributed to the 

work of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the International Organization 

of Securities Commissions, in particular with respect to the Principles for Financial Market 

Infrastructures and the resolution and recovery of such infrastructures, as well as to work in the field 

of over-the-counter derivatives market infrastructures. Furthermore, in the area of retail payments 

oversight, the Eurosystem defined oversight expectations for links between retail payment systems, 

and the Forum on the Security of Retail Payments developed security requirements for payments 

over the internet.The ECB also continued to facilitate the creation of an integrated European retail payments market, 
and a significant proportion of euro direct debits and credit transfers are now SEPA-compliant. 
 An important milestone in the TARGET2-Securities (T2S) project was reached in 2013, as the work 

on developing the software for T2S was completed. A testing phase is now under way to ensure 

that the T2S platform starts operating in June 2015 as scheduled. Agreement was also reached on 

the dates for the migration of central securities depositories (CSDs) and their users to T2S, which 

will take place in four waves between June 2015 and February 2017. The total number of CSDs 

participating in T2S increased to 24, as two further CSDs signed the T2S Framework Agreement. 

The continual growth of the T2S community demonstrates the significant impact that T2S will have 

on the post-trade infrastructure in Europe.Turning to organisational issues, the ECB had 1,907 full-time equivalent permanent positions at 
the end of 2013, compared with 1,450.5 positions at the end of 2012. The increase is mainly due 

to positions approved in 2013 in relation to the establishment of the SSM. In accordance with the 

ECB™s mobility policy, 308 members of staff moved internally to other positions in 2013, while 12 

members of staff were seconded to other organisations for external work experience and 62 were 

granted unpaid leave to study or take up employment with another organisation, or for personal 

reasons. In 2013 the ECB™s human resources strategy focused on working culture, gender diversity, 
recruitment, professional development and employment conditions. One of the main developments 

in the area of HR policies was the implementation of a gender diversity action plan designed with 

the aim of doubling the share of women in high-ranking positions at the ECB in the medium term.Work on the new ECB premises neared completion in 2013, with the double office tower reaching 
its final height of 185 m in March. By the end of the year, good progress had been made on the 

technical infrastructure and fit-out of the standard office floors. The entrance building took shape 

and now clearly marks the main entrance to the ECB. Restoration works on the Grossmarkthalle 

roof and west wing progressed. The relocation of ECB staff is planned for the second half of 2014.11ECBAnnual Report2013Regarding its financial accounts, the ECB earned a surplus of •1,440.2 million in 2013, compared 
with a surplus of •2,161 million 1 in 2012. The Governing Council decided to transfer, as at 31 December
 2013, an amount of •0.4 million to the provision for foreign exchange rate, interest 
rate, credit and gold price risks, thereby increasing it to its ceiling of •7,529.7 million, which 

was the value of the ECB™s capital paid up by the euro area NCBs as at that date. The size of 

this provision is reviewed annually. The ECB™s net profit for 2013, following the transfer to the 
provision, was •1,439.8 million. The remaining amount of •1,430.3 million was distributed to the 

euro area NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the ECB™s capital.Frankfurt am Main, March 2014Mario Draghi1 As restated owing to a change in accounting policies.
In 2013 visible progress was made on the construction of the new ECB premises. The structural works for all of the 
new building elements were completed in the spring and the concrete shells of the Grossmarkthalle™s roof had been fully 
restored by the end of the year. The interior of the large market hall has now also taken on a new splendour.13ECBAnnual Report2013CHAPTER 1ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 AND MONETARY POLICY1 M
ONETARY POLICY DECISIONSTHE MONETARY POLICY ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED BUT REMAINED CHALLENGINGIn 2013 the Eurosystem conducted its monetary policy in an environment which remained 
challenging, despite improvements in economic confidence, financial market sentiment and 

financing conditions. The level of stress in financial markets had been easing since the summer 

of 2012 on the back of the non-standard monetary policy measures undertaken by the ECB, the 

reform efforts made in several euro area countries, and progress towards a stronger euro area 

economic governance framework. Funding constraints for euro area banks continued to ease over 

the course of 2013, including for financial institutions in stressed countries. At the same time, 

a substantial degree of financial market segmentation along national borders persisted. Overall, 

while financial fragmentation continued to recede in the course of 2013, it remained elevated, 

resulting in significant heterogeneity in financing conditions for households and firms across euro 

area countries. 
The ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, 
combined with high unemployment and ongoing fiscal consolidation, continued to dampen 

economic activity in the euro area in 2013. At the same time, receding financial market tensions, 

improving economic confidence and a pick-up in foreign demand allowed output to stabilise in the 

second quarter after six quarters of contraction. The recovery, which gradually took hold over the 

second half of the year, also encompassed domestic demand. For the year as a whole, real GDP 
nonetheless declined by 0.4%.Average annual HICP inflation stood at 1.4% in 2013 Œ with inflation declining perceptibly over 
the course of the year from 2.2% in December 2012 to 0.8% in December 2013 Œ as compared with 

the annual average of 2.5% in 2012. Low euro area inflation rates mainly reflected a strong decline 

in energy and food price inflation. The outlook for inflation was also revised downwards during 

the year in a context of weak economic activity. At the same time, medium and long-term inflation 

expectations remained firmly anchored at levels consistent with the Governing Council™s aim of 

keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remained subdued throughout 2013. M3 growth 
overall weakened in the course of the year, reaching an annual average rate of 2.4%, as compared 
with 3.1% in 2012. Loans to the private sector contracted again during 2013, reflecting in particular 

net redemptions of loans to non-financial corporations. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics 

reflected the weak economic situation and outlook, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing 

adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which continued to weigh 

on credit demand. Furthermore, in a number of euro area countries, pressure on banks to further 

deleverage remained high. Despite substantial improvements in the funding situation of banks 

since the summer of 2012 and an increase in economic confidence, credit supply continued to be 

restricted by capital constraints, the segmentation of financial markets and risk perception.DIMINISHED INFLATIONARY PRESSURES LED TO TWO FURTHER CUTS IN KEY ECB INTEREST RATESTo ensure price stability in an environment of low underlying price pressures over the medium 

term, and to support the gradual economic recovery, the Governing Council cut key ECB interest 

rates twice in the course of 2013. In May it cut the interest rate on the main refinancing operations 
14ECBAnnual Report
2013by 25 basis points and the interest rate on the 
marginal lending facility by 50 basis points. In 

November, given the overall subdued outlook 
for inflation extending into the medium term, 

the Governing Council cut both the interest 
rate on the main refinancing operations and the 

interest rate on the marginal lending facility by 

a further 25 basis points. Policy rates were then 

kept at their historically low level of 0.25% for 
the main refinancing rate, 0.00% for the rate on 

the deposit facility and 0.75% for the rate on 

the marginal lending facility for the remainder 

of the year (see Chart 1). The Governing 
Council confirmed that the ECB™s monetary 

policy stance would remain accommodative 

for as long as necessary, given its expectations 

of a prolonged period of low inflation, to be 

followed by a gradual upward movement 

towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% 

later on. In order to anchor market expectations of future policy interest rates more firmly around a path 
warranted by its assessment of the outlook for price stability over the medium term, the Governing 

Council decided in July 2013 to provide forward guidance, stating that it expected the key 

ECB interest rates to remain at their prevailing or lower levels for an extended period of time 

(see Box 1). It confirmed this message over the remaining months of the year. The Governing 
Council™s expectations continued to be based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation 

extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued 
 monetary dynamics.Box 1THE ECB™S FORWARD GUIDANCEOn 4 July 2013 the Governing Council of the ECB announced that it expected the key ECB 

interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. The expectation 

of the Governing Council was based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending 

into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary 

dynamics. This communication provided a form of forward guidance on the monetary policy 

orientation of the Governing Council, conditional on the assessment of risks to price stability. 

Following the initial announcement, the forward guidance provided in July was confirmed in 

its original formulation throughout the second half of the year. Notably, forward guidance was 

reasserted after the monetary policy decisions of 7 November 2013, which were taken in full 

consistency and continuity with that formulation. This box reviews the objectives, the design and 

the market impact of forward guidance.Chart 1 ECB interest rates and the

align more firmly market expectations concerning the future evolution of the key ECB interest 

rates with the Governing Council™s conditional policy orientation. The decision taken by the 

Governing Council on 4 July came after a period in which euro money market interest rates had  been rising consistently and had become more volatile. This market trend had led to a situation in 

which the accommodation introduced earlier through policy action had effectively been reduced. 

Moreover, the increased volatility in money market rates had made expectations of the effective 

stance overly sensitive to shocks that were disconnected from the underlying economic and 

monetary conditions of the euro area. In addition to shifting market expectations regarding future 

monetary policy decisions and changes in the expected future path of excess liquidity, spillovers 

from developments originating outside the euro area were a key factor driving money market 

rates at that time. In these circumstances, more precise communication about the monetary policy 
 orientation of the Governing Council was aimed at promoting steadier money market conditions 

and anchoring market expectations about future policy rates more firmly around a path warranted 

by the Governing Council™s assessment of the outlook for price stability over the medium term.Design
The Governing Council™s forward guidance, in full accordance with the ECB™s mandate and its 
monetary policy strategy, was designed around three main elements. First, the Governing Council™s expected path for the key ECB interest rates was based on the 
medium-term outlook for inflation, in line with the ECB™s primary objective to maintain price 

stability. Second, the extended period of time referred to by the Governing Council was a 

flexible horizon which did not pre-specify an end-date but was conditional on the Governing 

Council™s assessment of the economic and monetary developments that determine the outlook 

for price stability. Third, the underlying conditions upon which the expectations regarding the 

key ECB interest rates were based reflected the ECB™s approach to organising, evaluating and 

cross-checking the information relevant for assessing risks to price stability. In particular, this 

approach comprises the analysis of both economic and monetary developments, which provides 

a robust assessment of the medium-term outlook for price stability. Notably, the Governing Council decided to provide forward guidance before having exhausted the potential for further reductions in key ECB interest rates. By reducing uncertainty around the 

expected path of future interest rates, forward guidance can provide a firmer control over market 

expectations independently of the prevailing stance of monetary policy. In fact, the ECB™s 

forward guidance entailed the possibility to reduce key ECB interest rates further if warranted by 

the evolving outlook for price stability. The Governing Council™s decision of 7 November
 2013 to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem and the rate on the 

marginal lending facility, while leaving the deposit facility rate unchanged, was thus consistent 

with the conditionality of the 4 July statement. The confirmation of forward guidance after the 

November monetary policy decisions contributed to amplifying the accommodative impact of 

the interest rate reduction by facilitating its transmission to longer-term money market rates and 

to a broad set of financial market conditions. 16ECBAnnual Report
2013Market impactThe announcement of forward guidance on 4
 July 2013 led to an immediate flattening of the 
money market curve (see Chart A), with forward rates declining by around 5 basis points at 

maturities of more than six months. In the months following the introduction of forward 

guidance, however, the forward curve started to steepen, reflecting positive economic news and 

data releases within and outside the euro area. The slope of the forward curve reached a new 

high in September, before flattening in a sustained manner, notably as a consequence of the 

November monetary policy decisions. In parallel, forward guidance has led to a lasting decline in market uncertainty about the path 
of future short-term interest rates. Implied densities extracted from EURIBOR options show 

that the dispersion of short-term rate expectations has declined visibly from the elevated levels 

observed in June to a level closer to that observed in early May 2013 (see Chart
 B). On 2 May, 
after the Governing Council had reduced key ECB interest rates, market expectations of future 

interest rates one year ahead were concentrated around low levels. Thereafter uncertainty about 

future money market rates increased. With greater probability attached to higher levels, the mean 

expectation also increased, reaching its peak on 24 June. The forward guidance announcement 

subsequently led to a renewed narrowing of the dispersion of market expectations towards lower 

interest rate levels, accompanied by a downward shift in the mean expectation. Chart A EONIA forward rates0.000.250.50

evolving outlook for price stability. It also appears to have contributed to more stable money 

market conditions and to have anchored expectations more firmly. Therefore, forward guidance 

has successfully supported the ECB in the pursuit of its mandate to maintain price stability in the 

euro area over the medium term.Against the background of the monetary policy measures adopted throughout the year, the 

Governing Council considered that price developments remained in line with price stability over 
the policy-relevant horizon in an environment of weak economic growth, well-anchored medium-

term inflation expectations and subdued monetary dynamics. Risks to the outlook for price stability 

were seen to be broadly balanced.NON-STANDARD MONETARY POLICY MEASURES ADOPTED IN 2013Substantial early repayments of the three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) 

conducted in late 2011 and early 2012 meant a reduction in excess liquidity which, given remaining 

tensions in funding markets for banks, exerted some upward pressure on money market rates. To 

continue to ensure that solvent banks would not face liquidity constraints, especially once the three-

year LTROs matured, the Governing Council announced in November 2013 that the Eurosystem 
would continue to provide liquidity to banks through fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment 

in all refinancing operations until at least 7 July 2015.MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION IMPROVED BUT REMAINED UNEVEN ACROSS COUNTRIESThe effects of the two cuts in key ECB interest rates in 2013 as well as of forward guidance 
worked directly through term money market rates as there was little scope for a further reduction in 

overnight rates: for most of 2013 excess liquidity kept very short-term rates close to the rate on the 

deposit facility (which had been reduced to 0.00% in July 2012). The non-standard monetary policy measures adopted in 2011 and 2012 continued to contribute 
to a more effective transmission of the ECB™s interest rate measures in 2013. These non-standard 

measures included the two three-year LTROs conducted in late 2011 and early 2012, and the 

announcement by the Governing Council in the summer of 2012 of its readiness to undertake 

Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) in secondary markets with regard to sovereign bonds in 

the euro area.1 The measures helped to alleviate tensions in financial markets and reduced tail risks 
and uncertainty. They thereby contributed to a sustained improvement in financing conditions, 

evidenced, for example, by a continued decline in the government bond yields of countries under 

stress and the issuance of new bonds by banks, companies and sovereigns which for some time had 

not had access to markets.1 In order to address severe distortions in the pricing of sovereign debt in some euro area countries, in particular related to unfounded 
concerns on the part of investors about the reversibility of the euro, the Governing Council announced in August 2012 its readiness 
to undertake OMTs in secondary markets with regard to sovereign bonds in the euro area. OMTs had not been activated by the end of 

2013, but the Eurosystem remains ready to undertake them under certain conditions (outlined in detail in Section 1.1 of Chapter 2 of the 
ECB™s Annual Report 2012). The Governing Council will independently consider conducting OMTs to the extent that they are warranted 
from a monetary policy perspective in the event of market fragmentation (subject to the aforementioned conditions). OMTs are aimed at 
supporting the transmission mechanism in all euro area countries and the singleness of the monetary policy. They provide a fully effective 
backstop to avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for price stability in the euro area.18ECBAnnual Report
2013Although bank lending rates for households and non-financial corporations generally decreased at 
the euro area level in 2013, reflecting the pass-through of the cuts in key ECB interest rates as well 

as the improvement in financial market conditions, cross-country heterogeneity remained high. The 

lingering fragmentation of financial markets along national borders continued to hinder an even 

transmission of monetary policy in the euro area. As a result, the cuts in policy rates were largely 

passed on in some countries, but the interest rates charged on bank loans to the real economy 
decreased only slightly in other countries.In order to ensure the adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro 
area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and 

that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. The ECB™s comprehensive assessment of 

banks™ balance sheets before it adopts its supervisory role under the Single Supervisory Mechanism 

will further support this confidence-building process. It will enhance the quality of information 

available on the condition of banks and result in the identification and implementation of necessary 

corrective actions. Further decisive steps to establish banking union will help to restore confidence 

in the financial system. However, the root causes of the crisis are still to be fully addressed. In this 

context, governments should maintain their efforts to reduce deficits and sustain fiscal adjustment 

over the medium term. They should also decisively strengthen efforts to implement the needed 

structural reforms in product and labour markets to make their economies more competitive, and 

continue to improve the institutional setting of EMU.2 M
ONETARY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS2.1 THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 
GLOBAL RECOVERY CONTINUED AT A SLOW PACE IN 2013The global economy continued to grow at a modest pace in 2013, with the recovery slowly gaining 

some traction yet remaining fragile and heterogeneous across countries as the year progressed. 

In the early part of the year, survey indicators signalled sustained momentum in global economic 

growth, with the Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) for global all-industry output hovering slightly 

above 52.9, the average in the final quarter of 2012. The continuous strengthening of business 

sentiment, albeit from low levels, along with improved global financial conditions, pointed to a 

gradual recovery in advanced economies and more solid growth in emerging market economies. 

The data releases for the final quarter of 2012 and the first half of 2013 largely confirmed the 

pattern of continuing global recovery, which, however, remained muted and uneven. In advanced 

economies, growth stabilised in the first half of 2013, while in emerging market economies, 

contrary to expectations of gathering momentum, economic activity slowed again after rebounding 

at the end of 2012.As the year unfolded, a number of negative surprises in both sentiment and hard data underscored 
the fragility of the recovery and the uncertainty surrounding the global outlook. In May the 

suggestion by the Chairman of the US Federal Open Market Committee of the likelihood that 

the Federal Reserve System would be tapering its asset purchase programme triggered a period 
of heightened uncertainty and renewed volatility in global financial markets. These developments 

resulted in tighter financing conditions, particularly for some emerging market economies, and a 
19ECBAnnual Report2013significant sell-off in global financial assets. Box 2 discusses the role of country vulnerabilities in 
the repricing of risk in emerging market economies and reviews the euro area™s exposure to these 

economies. The tightening of global financial conditions during the summer, coupled with weaker 

domestic demand and a still subdued external environment, weighed on activity in emerging market 

economies, weakening their short-term growth prospects. In the second half of 2013 a gradual shift in growth dynamics in favour of advanced economies 
was observed. The pace of growth steadily firmed in most major advanced economies, although 

their medium-term prospects continued to be restrained by ongoing balance sheet repair, fiscal 

consolidation, relatively tight credit conditions and weak labour markets. Meanwhile, growth 

in a number of large emerging market economies lost some vigour, also owing to structural 

impediments, but remained robust compared with that in advanced economies and contributed 

significantly to global economic activity. Social unrest and geopolitical tensions in a number of 

Middle Eastern and North African countries also stifled growth. Overall, global growth momentum remained slow, wavering and persistently divergent across 
countries. By the end of the year, however, data releases and survey indicators were both showing 

tentative signs of a gradual firming of global economic activity. The normalisation of global 

financing conditions in the second half of the year, after the adoption of forward guidance policies 
by the ECB and the Bank of England and the US Federal Open Market Committee™s decision to 

taper its asset purchases at a measured pace, seems to have removed some market uncertainty and 

supported global growth dynamics (see Chart 2). World trade picked up from the very low levels recorded during the second half of 2012 but continued to be characterised by moderate and volatile quarterly growth. Following several months 

of solid readings in the first half of 2013, short-term trade indicators weakened again at the end

2013Box 2IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EURO AREA OF CHANGING FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES In 2013 significant changes in financing conditions were witnessed across a number of countries. 
Emerging markets were particularly affected, as an episode of risk repricing that had already 

been observed in some of these countries in early 2013 was amplified by the US Federal Reserve 

System signalling in May that it might taper its asset purchase programme later in the year. 

The vulnerability of some emerging economies to changes in global investor sentiment became 

exposed when their asset markets and currencies underwent considerable corrections, resulting 

in a tangible tightening of the financing environment with negative repercussions on their growth 

dynamics.Against this background, this box attempts to gauge potential negative implications for the euro 
area of the deterioration in economic and financial conditions in emerging markets. It finds that 

the emerging markets most susceptible to the risk reassessment that took place during 2013 are 

characterised by significant domestic and external vulnerabilities. The euro area™s exposure to 

these latter countries via various transmission channels is relatively limited.The role of vulnerabilities in the repricing of emerging market risk
Following a global sell-off of emerging market assets immediately after the Federal Reserve 
System™s announcement in May 2013, investors adopted a more nuanced stance over the 
of the summer, before recovering in the last months of the year. Overall, the volume of world 

imports of goods grew by an average of 0.8% quarter on quarter in the first three quarters of 2013, 

compared with 0.4% in 2012, gaining more vigour from September onwards, according to data 

from the CPB Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis. At the end of 2013 all available 

short-term trade indicators pointed to a more sustained recovery in global trade, with the PMI new 
export order index recording its highest values since March 2011. Nevertheless, trade momentum is 

expected to remain subdued and below its pre-crisis levels in the near term. Regarding price developments, the slowdown in global inflation that has been observed since 2011 
continued in 2013, although it masked mixed developments across countries. A number of factors, 

including muted commodity price dynamics and weak global economic activity, as reflected in still 

ample global spare capacity and high unemployment, ensured that inflationary pressures remained 

contained. In the OECD area, average headline consumer price inflation fell to 1.6% in 2013, from 
2.2% in 2012, largely driven by lower energy and food prices. The decline was broadly based across 

advanced economies, with the exception of Japan, where inflation rose (see Chart 2). Average 

OECD consumer price inflation excluding food and energy fell to 1.5% from 1.8% in 2012. Rates 

of inflation varied more among emerging market economies over the course of the year. Annual 

inflation rates were relatively modest in China but remained elevated in some other large emerging 

market economies. The weak global and domestic environment, coupled with moderations in food 

and energy prices, helped to dampen price increases, although currency depreciation from the 

middle of the year increased inflationary pressures in some emerging market economies. 21ECBAnnual Report2013remainder of the year. Their focus shifted to countries that were perceived to be particularly 
vulnerable to possible further disruptions to capital flows, which resulted in additional 

declines in the latter™s equity, bond and currency markets. Countries with significant domestic 
 and/or external imbalances, such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey, therefore 

generally saw the largest deterioration in their financing environment.Investor perceptions of domestic or external vulnerabilities of this group of countries are 
substantiated by a range of indicators. These economies stood out at the end of 2012 as being 
potentially susceptible to a worsening of global funding conditions (see the table). Turkey 

exhibited domestic vulnerabilities, such as very strong credit growth, and external imbalances, 

above all a substantial current account deficit largely financed by short-term portfolio flows 

and an unfavourable ratio of short-term external debt to foreign exchange reserves. India, South 

Africa and Œ to a lesser extent Œ Brazil and Indonesia had twin (fiscal and current account) 

deficits. These were combined in the latter three countries with a dependence on volatile 

portfolio investment (South Africa) or excessive credit growth (Brazil and Indonesia). However, 

some economies that seem to have been equally vulnerable on the basis of the same metrics were 

generally less affected by global market volatility. This points to the relevance of other factors 

shaping investors™ views on emerging economies, such as exposure to a slowdown in Chinese 

output, the capacity to benefit from the gradual recovery of economic activity in the euro area 

or the vigour with which governments have addressed existing imbalances, for example by 

implementing fiscal consolidation or structural reforms.Selected indicators of external and domestic vulnerabilities External indicatorsDomestic indicatorsCurrent account balancePortfolio inflows 1)Short-term external debtTotal external debtFiscal balanceCredit-to-GDP gap 2)(as a percentage of GDP)2012(as a percentage of total capital inflows)2010-12(as a percentage of foreign reserves)2012(as a percentage of GDP)2012(as a percentage of GDP)2012(percentage points)2012Czech Republic (CZ)-2.436.058.350.5-4.4n. a.Hungary (HU)1.7-48.383.0130.3-2.0-16.5Poland (PL)-3.553.497.674.4-3.91.0Romania (RO)-4.445.7121.875.7-2.5n. a.Russia (RU)3.76.232.728.60.4-2.7Turkey (TR)-6.141.8147.742.8-1.611.7China (CN)2.37.317.69.0-2.213.4India (IN)-4.822.944.321.2-8.03.4Indonesia (ID)-2.734.250.729.4-1.712.8Malaysia (MY)6.163.839.127.1-4.55.5South Korea (KR)3.888.739.436.21.93.4Taiwan (TW)10.5n. a.28.827.5-4.3n. a.Thailand (TH)0.029.641.636.4-1.726.2Argentina (AR)0.014.0272.932.0-4.32.9Brazil (BR)-2.424.821.314.1-2.710.2Mexico (MX)-1.266.067.329.2-3.73.4South Africa (ZA)-6.354.679.635.8-4.8-4.9Sources: IMF, BIS, national sources, Haver Analytics and ECB calculations.1) Portfolio investment liabilities incurred in the period 2010-12 as a percentage of all (foreign direct, portfolio and other) investment

2013Euro area exposure to vulnerable emerging marketsThe direct transmission to the euro area of deteriorating economic and financial conditions in 
emerging markets is likely to be relatively contained. The euro area™s trade and financial ties 

with most emerging economies are fairly limited, a few noteworthy exceptions notwithstanding 

(see the chart). Moreover, its exposure to individual emerging markets is generally highest for 

countries which seem to have been least affected by global financial developments in 2013. 

However, besides direct implications for the euro area of slower growth in emerging markets, 

indirect effects may also play a role. For example, a fall in commodity prices as a result of 

lower demand from emerging economies could improve the euro area™s terms of trade, although 
it might also put additional downward pressure on inflation. Furthermore, euro area foreign 

demand might be affected via indirect trade linkages if a slowdown in output growth in emerging 
markets were to affect economic activity in the euro area™s major trading partners among the 

advanced economies.Looking at financial linkages in more detail, euro area portfolio investment in emerging 
economies is negligible. According to data from the IMF™s Coordinated Portfolio Investment 

Survey, Brazil, China, Poland and South Korea are the only countries where the euro area™s 
share of total portfolio assets held abroad is over 1.0%. Cross-border bank claims, while mostly 

more significant than portfolio flows, predominantly involve certain countries in central and 

eastern Europe (such as Poland with 4.0% of total claims and the Czech Republic with 3.0%) 

and Latin America (particularly Brazil with 3.6% and Mexico with 2.8%). As regards trade 

linkages, emerging market countries in close proximity to the euro area generally feature most 

prominently, with merchandise exports to Poland (5.1%), Russia (4.7%), the Czech Republic

China, which takes 7.0% of euro area merchandise exports. Among the countries that were considered most vulnerable by investors during 2013 and that

only Turkey and Brazil account for significant shares in the euro area™s exposure to emerging 

markets, via trade (Turkey) and cross-border bank flows (Brazil and Turkey). The shares of 

India, Indonesia and South Africa are very small. UNITED STATESThe recovery in the US economy continued in 2013, although at a slower pace than in the previous 

year. Real GDP growth stood at 1.9%, compared with 2.8% in 2012. Growth in 2013 was supported 

by a strengthening in private domestic demand, reflecting continued improvements in the housing 

and labour markets, supportive financial conditions resulting in positive wealth effects from rising 

stock and house prices, and accommodative monetary policy. In addition, inventory accumulation 

and, to a lesser extent, net trade also contributed positively to real GDP growth. The current 

account deficit narrowed to 2.4% of GDP in the first three quarters of the year, from 2.7% in 2012. 
 By contrast, higher taxes, as enshrined in the fiscal agreement of January 2013, and the automatic 

across-the-board spending cuts (the ﬁsequesterﬂ) enacted in March, remained a drag on economic 
activity throughout the year.In the first half of the year economic activity remained sluggish, against the backdrop of continued 
declines in government consumption related to the aforementioned government spending cuts, 

subdued private non-residential investment and weak exports. Nevertheless, private consumption 

expenditure was resilient during the same period, with higher taxes and sluggish income growth 

being more than offset by an improvement in the labour market and substantial positive wealth 

effects owing to rising stock and house prices. Private residential investment also remained quite 

robust on the back of a resilient recovery in the housing sector. Real GDP accelerated in the second 

half of 2013, with particularly strong growth in the third quarter. Economic activity, however, lost 

some momentum towards the end of the year on account of two main factors. The increase in 

long-term interest rates, starting in May, when the Federal Reserve suggested it might slow the 

pace of asset purchases later in the year, resulted in a tightening of financial conditions, which 

dampened somewhat the housing market recovery. In addition, the government shutdown following 

the political brinkmanship over the debt limit extension in October, with the associated rise in 

uncertainty, weighed on domestic demand. Meanwhile, labour market momentum remained quite 

resilient in the second half of 2013, although the year ended with a substantial deceleration in the 

pace of job creation, partly reflecting severe weather conditions in December. The unemployment 

rate continued to trend down in the course of the year, owing partly to continued declines in the 

labour force participation rate. Average annual CPI inflation declined to 1.5% in 2013, from 2.1% in 2012, owing to lower energy 
prices and considerable spare capacity, which kept underlying price pressures contained. In the 

first half of 2013 CPI inflation hovered between 1.1% and 2%, affected by substantial volatility 

in the energy component, while food prices exhibited a slightly downward trend. Through most of 

the second half of 2013, annual CPI inflation declined as the strong positive base effects of energy 

prices waned. Excluding food and energy, CPI inflation stood at 1.8% in 2013, after 2.1% in 2012.24ECBAnnual Report
2013The US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve System kept its target for 
the federal funds rate unchanged within a range of 0% to 0.25% throughout 2013, in an environment 

of moderate economic and employment growth and inflation running below the Committee™s 

longer-term objective. The FOMC announced that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds 

rate would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5%, inflation 

between one and two years ahead was not projected to be above 2.5% and longer-term inflation 

expectations continued to be well anchored. The FOMC decided to continue purchasing additional 

agency mortgage-backed securities at a rate of USD 40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury 

securities at a rate of USD 45 billion per month. Furthermore, the Committee maintained its existing 

policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-

backed securities. With these actions, the FOMC expected to maintain downward pressure on 

longer-term interest rates with a view to supporting mortgage markets and to help make broader 
financial conditions more accommodative. In June the FOMC reaffirmed Chairman Bernanke™s 

remarks before the US Congress Joint Economic Committee in May that, later in the year, the 

FOMC could slow the pace of asset purchases should the economy continue to improve as expected. 

It stated that it expected its asset purchase programme to end in mid-2014. Nevertheless, taking into 

account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment in the period to September and the prevailing fiscal 

policy uncertainty, the Committee announced in September that it would wait for more evidence of 

sustained progress in economic activity and labour market conditions before adjusting the pace of 

its asset purchases. On 18 December the Committee decided to ease the pace of its asset purchases 

slightly, given the cumulative progress towards maximum employment and the improvement in 

the outlook for labour market conditions. The FOMC announced that, from January 2014 onwards, 

it would add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a rate of USD 35 billion per 

month, rather than USD 40 billion, and to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a rate 

of USD 40 billion per month, instead of USD 45 billion. The Committee stated that it would likely 

reduce its asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings, conditional on the FOMC™s 

assessment of economic developments. As regards fiscal policy, the federal budget deficit declined significantly to 4.1% of GDP in fiscal 
year 2013, from 6.8% in the previous year.2 Federal debt held by the public increased to stand 
at 72.1% of GDP at the end of 2013, compared with 70.1% at the end of 2012. A large part of 

the reduction in the fiscal deficit in 2013 was due to a political agreement on tax and spending 

reforms (the American Taxpayer Relief Act) in early January, which mainly included revenue-

raising measures, and to the across-the-board spending cuts enacted in March. However, political 
uncertainty over the most appropriate fiscal path persisted throughout the year. Political and fiscal 

uncertainty reached a peak in October, stemming from the partial shutdown of non-essential 

government services, coupled with political brinkmanship over the extension of the debt limit. 

Although a political deal was reached to keep the government funded and the debt limit suspended 

to avoid a government default, fiscal uncertainty continued to cloud the short-term economic 

outlook. On 26 December 2013 President Obama signed into law a bipartisan budget deal to end 
some of the spending cuts under the sequester by raising the caps on discretionary spending for the 

next two fiscal years, replacing them with other sources of saving spread over ten years.JAPANIn Japan, economic activity rebounded during 2013, mainly driven by robust domestic demand. 

While growth was vibrant in the first half of the year, it lost momentum thereafter as net exports 

weighed on growth and private consumption slowed. In 2013 economic growth was supported by a 
2 Fiscal years in the United States run from October of the previous year to September of the reference year.
25ECBAnnual Report2013more accommodative monetary and fiscal policy as part of the government™s new growth strategy. 
This strategy is intended to move Japan away from persistent deflation and to boost the country™s 

trend growth through three distinct pillars: (i) Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing 

(QQE) by the Bank of Japan, (ii) a fiscal stimulus implemented at the start of 2013, followed by 

a commitment to fiscal consolidation over the medium term, and (iii) structural reform to boost 

productivity and labour force growth. On 4 April 2013 the Bank of Japan unveiled the details of the QQE, while it discontinued the Asset 
Purchase Program announced earlier in January. In the context of the QQE, the price stability target 

of 2% in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI by 2015 was reaffirmed by the central 

bank through a doubling, by the end of 2014, of the monetary base, which will rise at an annual rate 

of JPY 60-70 trillion. Year-on-year CPI inflation turned positive in June, before climbing to 1.6% 

in December, the highest level since 2008. In addition, year-on-year CPI inflation excluding food, 

beverages and energy also increased, rising to 0.7% in December from -0.7% in January.Regarding fiscal policy, an economic stimulus package announced at the start of 2013 was followed by commitments to halve the primary deficit Œ estimated at 7% for 2013 Œ by 2015 and to achieve 

a primary surplus by 2020. Meanwhile, the third pillar of the government™s new growth strategy Œ 
structural reform Œ involves a series of initiatives to boost Japan™s long-term growth rate through 

increased competition and the elimination of inefficiencies in the product market, as well as 

increased participation in the labour force. In addition to labour market reforms, an increase in 

private sector wages, scheduled for 2014, should help to reinforce higher prices, thus helping the 

Bank of Japan to reach its 2% inflation target.EMERGING ASIAThe pace of economic activity in emerging Asia remained broadly steady in 2013, still below its 

long-term average. Although export growth rose somewhat amid the gradual recovery in advanced 

economies, stronger import growth led to a weaker contribution of net exports. Domestic demand 

remained resilient, supported by favourable credit and policy conditions, but lost vigour in the 

course of the year mainly owing to a tightening of monetary and fiscal policies in countries with 

structural problems (e.g. India and Indonesia). On account of stable commodity prices and a modest 

economic recovery, inflation was contained in 2013, with the exception of India and Indonesia, 

where weakening currencies led to increased inflationary pressures. With the US Federal Reserve 

System signalling its intention to taper its asset purchases, and against the backdrop of weak 

fundamentals, the currencies of both countries depreciated abruptly between May and August 2013, 

with significant capital outflows. In view of increasing inflationary pressures, India and Indonesia 

raised their policy rates, while most other central banks in emerging Asia maintained or cut their 

policy rates.In China, real GDP growth was 7.7% in 2013, unchanged from the previous year. Although 
economic activity was relatively weak in the first half of 2013, it gained strength in the second half 

of the year supported by, among other factors and policy measures, the introduction of a small fiscal 

stimulus package. Investment was the main driver of growth, followed closely by consumption, 
while net exports made a small negative contribution. Residential housing sales grew solidly during 

the year but construction activity was more subdued, depleting the stock of unsold housing and 

leading to sustained price increases. A weak international environment continued to weigh on the 

economy. Growth in trade in goods remained moderate, with exports growing by 7.8% and imports 
26ECBAnnual Report
2013by 7.3% year on year, far below the growth rates seen prior to the crisis. As a result, the current account surplus stood at 2.1% of GDP. In mid-November economic policy priorities for the next ten 

years were unveiled. The priorities aim to increase the role of market forces in the economy, which 

should help reduce domestic imbalances and set economic growth on a more sustainable path.Annual consumer price inflation was unchanged from 2012 at 2.6%. However, producer price 
inflation remained negative, declining further to 
-1.9% compared with -1.7% in 2012. Monetary 
policy rates and reserve requirements remained unchanged in 2013. Credit expansion continued 

to be strong, with the growth of bank loans declining only marginally, while total social financing 

decreased more markedly especially towards the end of the year. The renminbi continued to appreciate during 2013, although the pace of appreciation declined 
towards the end of the year. China™s foreign exchange reserves grew, amounting to 41% of GDP 

at the end of the year. On 8 October 2013 the ECB and the People™s Bank of China established a 

bilateral currency swap arrangement (see also Section 1.2 of Chapter 2). LATIN AMERICAEconomic activity in Latin America continued to recover overall in 2013, albeit at a rather subdued 

pace and unevenly across major economies. Domestic demand continued to be the main driver of 

growth in the region, while external demand acted as a drag on activity especially at the beginning 

of the year owing to the slowdown in the world economy and, in particular, in the euro area and the 

United States. For the region as a whole, year-on-year real GDP growth stood at 2.9% in the first 

half of 2013, slightly below the average of 3.1% in 2012. In the second half of the year economic 
growth lost momentum owing to constraints on the domestic side, although foreign demand showed 

signs of improvement.In Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, the recovery continued at a slow pace. Private 
consumption remained subdued amid high inflation, moderating consumer credit growth and 
somewhat less favourable labour market conditions, while external demand contributed negatively 

to growth. Year-on-year real GDP growth rose to 2.4% on average in the first three quarters of 

2013, compared with 0.8% in the first three quarters of 2012. In Mexico, the economy slowed 

significantly in 2013, reflecting weakness in public and private investment and in external demand. 

In Argentina, the economic indicators released later in the year suggested activity had weakened 

after the unexpectedly strong growth in the first half of the year.Financial market instability, together with persistent inflationary pressures, prompted the Banco 
Central do Brasil to increase interest rates by 275 basis points to 10% between April and November, 
partially reversing the previous cycle of interest rate cuts. Against this background and owing to 

a moderation in food prices, annual consumer price inflation eased to 5.9% in December, after 

standing at 6.7% in June, above the upper bound of the central bank™s inflation target. Overall 

in the region, average annual consumer price inflation increased from 6.1% in 2012 to 7.5% in 

2013, mainly owing to high inflationary pressures in Venezuela. After the US Federal Reserve 

System™s announcement of a possible gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus, financial markets 

went through a period of significant volatility between May and August, as reflected in exchange 

rate depreciations, capital outflows and a decline in equity prices.27ECBAnnual Report2013MODERATE DYNAMICS IN COMMODITY PRICES 
 IN 2013Brent crude oil prices were broadly stable in the 
course of 2013, fluctuating around USD
 110 
per barrel (see Chart 3). This marks a third 

consecutive year of record high Brent oil prices, 

at an annual average above USD 100 per barrel. 
In euro terms, oil prices declined by 3% in the 

course of 2013 owing to the appreciation of 

the euro. Both demand and supply factors explain the relative stability of Brent oil prices. The 

economic slowdown in emerging market 

economies coupled with a muted recovery in 

advanced economies dampened growth in the 

demand for oil. Meanwhile, oil supplies were 

boosted by a rapid increase in US shale oil 

production, which pushed growth in non-OPEC 
supply to its highest annual rate since 2002. 
However, a large part of this supply remained 

concentrated in the United States, contributing 

to a build-up in oil inventories and pushing the US oil price benchmark (West Texas Intermediate) 

lower. By contrast, Brent oil prices remained high, especially in the second half of the year, owing 

to a number of severe supply interruptions in several OPEC countries (such as Libya, Iraq and 
Nigeria), which could not be offset by increased production by Saudi Arabia. In addition, renewed 

geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and North Africa added upward pressure on oil prices. The prices of non-energy commodities, in aggregate terms, declined in 2013 (see Chart 3). Among 
the sub-components, cereal prices showed significant declines, owing to a strong rise in supply 

stimulated by the price peaks in the summer of 2012 and less adverse weather conditions in 

major exporting countries than during the previous year. Non-ferrous metal prices also declined, 

especially in the first half of the year, driven mainly by a slowdown in emerging market economies, 

particularly China. In aggregate terms, non-energy commodity prices (denominated in US dollars) 

were 4.9% lower at the end of 2013 than at the beginning of the year.THE EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE EURO STRENGTHENED OVER THE YEAREuro exchange rate developments in 2013 largely reflected evolving market expectations regarding 

the monetary policy stance in the euro area relative to other major economies. This was particularly 

evident in the first quarter of 2013, which was characterised by relatively pronounced fluctuations 

in the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro. Specifically, the euro appreciated by almost 4% 

in January 2013, stabilised in February and depreciated in March to the level observed at the start of 

the year (see Chart 4). Thereafter, the euro was temporarily broadly stable in an environment of low 

volatility in global foreign exchange markets. This trend came to a halt in mid-May, when markets 

began to consider that the US Federal Reserve System might start tapering its quantitative easing 

programme in the near future. Amid heightened tensions in global financial markets, coupled with 

pronounced capital outflows from some emerging market economies, the euro gradually appreciated 

until mid-September. Largely on account of better than expected data on economic activity in the

currencies of large commodity-exporting economies, the euro appreciated over the course of 2013 

by 21% against the Australian dollar, by 12% against the Canadian dollar and by 14% against the 
Norwegian krone. Against the pound sterling, the euro strengthened modestly, trading at GBP 0.83 at the end of 2013, 
around 2% above its level at the beginning of the year and 3% higher than its average level in 

2012. Similarly, the euro appreciated modestly against the Asian currencies that are linked to the 

US dollar, including the Chinese renminbi (by 1.6%) and the Hong Kong dollar (by 4.6%). Against 

the Swiss franc, the euro appreciated but continued to trade close to the minimum exchange rate of 

CHF 1.20, which was unilaterally announced by the Swiss National Bank in September 2011. On 

31 December 2013 the euro stood at CHF 1.23, 2% above its level at the end of 2012.The real effective exchange rates of the euro based on different cost and price measures increased 
over the year. In the second half of 2013 they stood at levels above those prevailing at the end of 

2012 (see Chart 5).2.2 M
ONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSSUBDUED UNDERLYING MONEY AND CREDIT GROWTH DURING 2013Broad money growth declined over the course of 2013, thereby remaining at subdued levels. 
 The annual growth rate of M3, which had stood at 3.5% in December 2012, decreased for most 
of the year. In December 2013 it was 1.0%. From a general perspective, monetary developments 

in the euro area were influenced by a number of factors. On the one hand, a reduced risk aversion 

and a search for yield by the money-holding sector led to considerable outflows from less liquid 

instruments included in M3 into riskier and longer-term assets. On the other hand, a strong 

preference for the most liquid instruments within M3 was observed in an environment of low 

interest rates, leading to robust growth in M1. This was also driven by a reduction in financial 

fragmentation and a return of confidence among international investors in the euro and euro 

area as well as by improvements in current account balances. In addition, it may have reflected 
 other factors, such as regulatory changes that encourage banks to increase their reliance on retail 

deposit-based funding. The positive developments were supported by signs of an ongoing recovery 

in real activity, the low interest rate environment, in particular following the further reductions in 

key ECB interest rates in May and November, and reductions in risk premia on government bonds 

for a number of euro area countries. The Governing Council™s announcements of its readiness to 
 undertake Outright Monetary Transactions, changes in collateral rules for Eurosystem credit 

operations and forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates also contributed. Improvements in financial markets and bank funding have not yet led to an increase in loans to 
the non-financial sector. The annual rate of change in loans to the private sector (adjusted for the 

impact of loan sales and securitisation activity) declined steadily in 2013, stabilising towards the 

end of the year and standing at -2.0% in December, compared with -0.2% in December 2012. In 
line with this development, the divergence observed since early 2012 in the annual growth rates of 

money and credit to the private sector persisted during 2013 (see Chart 6). At the same time, some 

of the funding pressures faced by MFIs have been alleviated by the non-standard measures adopted 

by the Governing Council over the past few years. These measures provided important backstops 
30ECBAnnual Report
2013that limited a further strengthening of negative 
feedback loops between financial markets and 

the real economy. Taken together, developments 

in broad money and credit indicate that the pace 

of underlying monetary expansion declined 

in 2013. These developments reflect ongoing 

deleveraging.PORTFOLIO CONSIDERATIONS REMAINED THE KEY DRIVER OF DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPONENTS 
 OF M3As regards the developments in the main 

components of M3, the uncertainties prevailing 

in financial markets and the accompanying 

preference for highly liquid deposits Œ against 

the background of very low policy and money 

market interest rates Œ manifested themselves 

mainly in a marked increase in the annual 

growth rate of M1. It rose to 8.6% in April 2013, 

from 6.4% in December 2012, before declining 

but remaining at an elevated level (5.7% in 

December 2013; see Chart 7). These portfolio 
reallocations took place amid a decline in the remuneration of other monetary assets contained 

in M3, with the effect of a reduction in the opportunity costs of holding highly liquid instruments 

(see Chart 8). This preference for liquidity points to a continued build-up of cash buffers by the 

money-holding sector.Chart 6 M3 and loans to the private sector(annual percentage changes; adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects)

standing at -16.2% in December compared with -6.5% in December 2012. All three sub-components 

of marketable instruments registered a persistent decline, partly owing to regulatory changes that 

reduce banks™ incentives to use market-based funding. Repurchase agreements have in the past often been used by investors to temporarily park liquidity, 
but may have lost attractiveness in the light of an ongoing search for yield in instruments outside 

M3 (such as equity and mixed funds). 2013 also saw a sizeable reduction in the money-holding 

sector™s holdings of short-term MFI debt securities (i.e. debt securities with an original maturity 

of up to two years), the annual rate of change of which declined substantially over the course of 

the year and stood at a negative double-digit level in December. Money market fund shares/units 

displayed a continuous decline over the course of 2013. This behaviour was related to remuneration 

considerations: in an environment of very low short-term interest rates, money market funds have 

not been in a position to generate significant returns for investors and have therefore experienced 

an ongoing reallocation of funds to other types of investment. The weak issuance of MFI debt 

securities and money market fund shares/units may also reflect regulatory changes encouraging 

banks to use deposit-based rather than market-based funding.DEPOSIT HOLDINGS OF NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS INCREASEDThe annual growth rate of M3 deposits Œ which comprise short-term deposits and repurchase 

agreements and represent the broadest monetary aggregate for which reliable information is 

available at the sectoral level Œ decreased from 4.4% in December 2012 to 2.0% in December 2013.
As in the past, households were the largest contributor to this development. The annual growth rate 
of M3 deposits held by households declined over the course of 2013 from 4.4% in December 2012 

to 2.0% in December 2013, notwithstanding the efforts of banks to increase deposit funding against 

the background of regulatory requirements and the considerable increase in deposit holdings in 2013 
in a number of stressed countries, reflecting the return of confidence on the part of international 

investors as well as of domestic money-holding sectors in financial investment in the euro area. 

By contrast, the annual growth rate of M3 deposits held by non-financial corporations accelerated 

from 4.6% in December 2012 to 6.1% in December 2013. This may reflect a build-up of liquidity 

buffers, which are typically used as a first funding source at the start of a recovery. However, at 

least in some countries, it may also reflect an increased need for internal funding in the context of 

supply-side restrictions. Capital inflows from abroad, in part related to renewed interest in euro area 
assets on the part of international investors, supported this process.Developments in M3 deposits also reflected the contribution made by non-monetary financial 
intermediaries other than insurance corporations and pension funds (referred to as ﬁother financial 

intermediariesﬂ or OFIs). The annual rate of change in M3 deposits held by OFIs decreased to 

-2.0% in December 2013 from 2.1% in December 2012, albeit with considerable fluctuations. From 

an economic perspective, the money demand behaviour of OFIs (which include investment funds 

and securitisation vehicles) can sometimes be very erratic, so its short-term dynamics should not 

be over-interpreted. Indeed, the money holdings of OFIs are often significantly affected by volatile 

conditions in financial markets and shifts in relative yields across a broad range of assets. At the 

same time, the behaviour of these investors endows their money holdings with early signalling 

properties for incipient trends in portfolio allocation which will only emerge with a lag in the money 

holdings of other sectors, such as households. The rate of change in deposits placed by general 32ECBAnnual Report
2013government other than the central government declined markedly, from 9.0% in December 2012 
 to -3.0% in December 2013. CONTRACTION IN CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTORAs regards the counterparts of M3, the annual rate of change in MFI credit to euro area residents 
declined to -2.0% in December 2013 from 0.5% in December 2012. This development was driven 

by a decrease in the annual rate of change in credit to both the general government and the private 

sector. The decrease in the annual rate of change in credit to general government, which stood 
at -0.7% in December 2013, reflected a decline in loans to general government, while demand 

for government debt securities remained positive. Overall, MFIs increased their holdings of 

government debt securities against a background of strong government issuance, subdued private 
sector dynamics and accommodative monetary conditions. Towards the end of the year, MFI 

holdings of government debt securities were affected by increased year-end deleveraging by some 

institutions positioning themselves ahead of the ECB™s comprehensive assessment, which is based 

on the 31 December 2013 balance sheet.The growth profile of credit to the private sector generally mirrors that of loans, which are the 
main component of this aggregate. Credit to the private sector moved further into negative 

territory in 2013, with an annual rate of change of -2.4% in December, compared with -0.8% in 

December 2012. The annual rate of change in MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for sales 

and securitisation) also declined over the year, standing at -2.0% in December 2013, compared with 

-0.2% in December 2012 (see Chart 9).This pattern is broadly consistent with 
developments in economic activity and financial 

markets over the course of 2013, in particular 
as regards loans to non-financial corporations, 

which normally lag economic developments by 

about one year. Developments in loans to the 

non-financial private sector reflected those in 

its main components. While the annual rate of 

change in loans to households (adjusted for sales 

and securitisation) remained broadly unchanged 

throughout the year, the rate of change in loans 

to non-financial corporations (adjusted for sales 

and securitisation) declined further, but showed 

signs of stabilisation in late 2013. Loans to OFIs 

also declined, albeit with considerable volatility.
The annual growth rate of loans to households 
(adjusted for sales and securitisation), which 

stood at 0.7% in December 2012, remained 

broadly stable during 2013, standing at 0.3% 
in December. Factors behind the low growth 

include the weakness of economic activity, 

the prospects for the housing market and the 

need to deleverage (for more details on lending 

to households, see the section on household

Longer-term financial liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) 

are shown with an inverted sign, since they are liabilities of the 

MFI sector.33ECBAnnual Report2013borrowing later in this chapter). At the end of the year, however, a pick-up in demand was reported in 
the euro area bank lending survey. The annual rate of change in loans to non-financial corporations 

(adjusted for sales and securitisation) stood at -2.9% in December 2013, having stabilised after 

following a declining path until late summer. The weakness of bank lending reflects not only cyclical but also structural supply and demand 
factors, with some differences from country to country. The weak loan dynamics for non-financial 

corporations continue to reflect primarily their lagging relationship with the business cycle, 

credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. This 

adjustment was visible in 2013, especially in certain countries, in strong issuance of securities 

by non-financial corporations. From a medium-term perspective, the need to reduce corporate 

indebtedness in a number of countries can be expected to continue to exert a negative influence on 
the demand for loans. On the supply side, capital shortfalls and the continued (albeit receding) financial market 
fragmentation limited the supply of MFI credit to the economy. Overall, supply constraints seem to 

have lessened over the course of 2013 but remain present in a number of countries. The various non-

standard monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council have contributed to averting 

a disorderly deleveraging of the banking sector by alleviating the funding pressures on euro area 

credit institutions. The results of the December 2013 euro area bank lending survey tentatively 
signalled a stabilisation in credit conditions for firms and households. Regarding the other counterparts of M3, the annual rate of change in MFI longer-term financial 
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) held by the money-holding sector remained in negative 

territory in 2013, standing at -3.3% in December after -5.0% in December 2012. This development 

was driven by sizeable declines in the rates of change in longer-term deposits and longer-term 

debt securities, the latter reflecting banks™ deleveraging and increased recourse to deposit funding 

relative to market funding. The outflows from longer-term deposits largely reflected a reversal of 

past securitisation activities.Finally, the net external asset position of euro area MFIs Œ which captures the capital flows of the 
money-holding sector when routed via MFIs and the transfer of assets issued by the money-holding 
 sector Œ increased strongly, by •361 billion, over the 12 months to December 2013, the largest 

inflow since the euro™s inception. These flows reflect an improvement in the current account 

balances of a number of countries, as well as a renewed interest among international investors in 

euro area assets.MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVED IN 2013Conditions in euro area money markets improved over the course of 2013. With the sovereign debt 

crisis abating, cross-border interbank markets started to reopen, although a substantial degree of 

market segmentation persisted.Perceived credit and country risk continued to decline in 2013, reflecting a further increase in 
financial market confidence, reform efforts made in several euro area countries, progress towards 

a stronger euro area economic governance framework, and some improvement in the euro area 

macroeconomic outlook. The continued decline in perceived credit and country risk led to a gradual 

reduction in market segmentation, including in interbank markets. Furthermore, the normalisation 

of financial market conditions reduced the need for banks to hold precautionary liquidity buffers.34ECBAnnual Report
2013In this context of gradually receding financial and interbank market fragmentation, excess liquidity 
(defined as the liquidity provided in excess of the banking sector™s liquidity needs, which are given 

by the sum of autonomous factors and reserve requirements) declined. Between 31 December
 2012 and 30 December 2013, excess liquidity fell from •621 billion to •275 billion, a decline of 

•346 billion. A large part of this decline, •323 billion, was due to a reduced net recourse to 

Eurosystem refinancing operations. The remainder was due to an increase in autonomous liquidity 

factors, which was partially offset by a marginal decrease in reserve requirements resulting from a 

decline in the reserve base of credit institutions (see Chart 10). The marked decline in net recourse to Eurosystem refinancing operations in the course of 2013 
encompassed the following developments. From January 2013 counterparties began making use 

of the early repayment option embedded in the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations 

(LTROs) of December 2011 and February 2012. By the end of December 2013 counterparties had 

repaid 37% of the gross liquidity Œ or 85% of the •523 billion net liquidity Œ injected by the two 

three-year LTROs, with accelerated repayments occurring at the beginning and the end of 2013 

(see Chart 10). Counterparties also substituted main refinancing operation (MRO) for LTRO 

funding. In particular, the acceleration of early LTRO repayments observed around the end of 2013 

was associated with an increased recourse to other liquidity-providing operations Œ the MROs in 

particular Œ as well as with a reduced total value of bids in the Eurosystem™s liquidity-absorbing 

fine-tuning operations. As a result, between November and December 2013 excess liquidity 

actually increased by •110 billion. However, large parts of that increase turned out to be only of a 

temporary nature, related as they were to the particularly tight money market conditions prevailing 

during the last maintenance periods of 2013.The reductions in the MRO rate in May and November 2013 lowered the cost of Eurosystem funding 
and narrowed the gap between the MRO rate and the deposit rate. While this reduced incentives

in excess liquidity. In this context, recourse 

to the deposit facility fell from an average of 

•238 billion in the last maintenance period of 

2012 to an average of •60 billion in the last 
maintenance period of
 2013. At the same time, 
the counterparties™ current account holdings in 

excess of reserve requirements decreased from 

•384 billion to •145 billion.Throughout most of 2013 the level of excess 
liquidity remained sufficiently high to keep 

very short-term money market rates close to 

the 0.00% deposit facility rate (see also Box 3). 

Nevertheless, the EONIA increased from 0.07% 

in December 2012 to 0.18% in December
 2013 in maintenance period average terms. More 

generally, money market rates in 2013 were 

affected by a variety of factors. Shorter-term 

money market rates were driven by uncertainty 

about the future path of excess liquidity, 

particularly around the end of January 2013, 

when initial repayments of the first three-year 

LTRO were very high. This factor became less important as repayments soon declined sharply 

from their very high initial levels. Longer-term money market rates fluctuated considerably owing 

to shifting expectations regarding future monetary policy and to spillovers from developments 

outside the euro area. Against this backdrop, the Governing Council introduced forward guidance 
in July 2013 to provide greater clarity on its monetary policy orientation (see Box 1). With the 

introduction of forward guidance, which was reinforced by the November 2013 Governing Council 

decision to lower the main refinancing rate to 0.25% and thereby narrow the effective corridor, 
 volatility in longer-term money market rates declined.Chart 11 shows the development of three-month unsecured interest rates (the three-month 
EURIBOR), three-month secured interest rates (the three-month EUREPO), and the three-month 

overnight index swap rate over the course of 2013. After their strong decline during the second half 

of 2012, all of these money market interest rates fluctuated in a relatively narrow range close to 

zero during 2013. Secured interest rates actually increased by a few basis points in the course of the 

year, with the three-month EUREPO quotes re-entering positive territory in January after having 

been in marginally negative territory for most of the second half of 2012. This development was 

consistent with the general trend of gradually receding financial market tensions which started in 

mid-2012 and continued throughout 2013.Chart 11 Three-month EUREPO, EURIBOR and

2013Box 3DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EUROSYSTEM™S BALANCE SHEET This box reviews how the Eurosystem™s balance sheet and money market rates developed in the 
course of 2013. It also touches upon issues related to the Eurosystem™s risk exposure.The balance sheet of a central bank largely reflects the implementation of its monetary policy. 
As a consequence of adopting non-standard measures to support the transmission of monetary 
policy in an environment of severe financial market stress, the Eurosystem™s balance sheet 

expanded in an unprecedented way, overall more than doubling in size between 2008 and mid-

2012, before starting to recede in the second half of 2012 (see Charts A and B).The fixed rate full allotment tender procedure that has been in place for essentially all refinancing 
operations since October 2008 implies that the demand for liquidity of euro area banks that are 

counterparties of the Eurosystem is met in full, provided counterparties can pledge adequate 

collateral to secure their borrowing. As a result, the size and composition of the Eurosystem™s 

balance sheet is determined, for a large part, by the euro area banking system™s aggregate demand 

for liquidity (see Charts A and B). Since its peak in summer 2012, the size of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet has declined steadily, 
reflecting receding financial fragmentation. Improved market funding was one of the important 

factors behind the reduced demand for central bank liquidity. This improvement was itself a 

result of the non-standard monetary policy measures adopted by the ECB, but also of structural 
reform efforts undertaken in several euro area countries and the progress made in strengthening 

the euro area™s framework for economic governance.Chart A Simplified Eurosystem balance sheet: assets(EUR billions)0200400

has declined, as banks used the option for an earlier repayment of funds received via the 

three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) conducted in December 2011 and 

February 2012.1 Around 37% of the liquidity provided in the three-year LTROs had been repaid 
by 20 December 2013, which corresponds to 85% of the net liquidity injected at the time these 
operations were conducted. The provision of central bank refinancing through the weekly 

main refinancing operations (with a one-week maturity), which had decreased substantially to 

around •90 billion at the end of December 2012, largely remained in a range of •90-130 billion 

throughout 2013. The balance sheet also includes holdings of assets acquired in the context of asset purchase programmes for monetary policy purposes conducted prior to 2013. These acquisitions are 

related to the first and second covered bond purchase programmes (July 2009 to June 2010 

and November 2011 to October 2012 respectively) and the Securities Markets Programme 

(May 2010 to September 2012). All these are classified as held-to-maturity portfolios, and 

are consequently valued at amortised cost subject to impairment. Their outstanding amount 

decreased slightly in
 2013, on account of assets reaching maturity. The combined portfolio of 

assets held outright provided liquidity of, on average, •257 billion in the period under review 

(i.e. from end-December 2012 to end-December 2013). Moreover, the Eurosystem continued to hold, in net terms, sizeable amounts of foreign reserves 
(i.e. foreign currency-denominated assets held outright for foreign exchange intervention or 
1 In the two three-year LTROs conducted on 21 December 2011 and 29 February 2012, a total amount of •1,018.7 billion was allotted. However, taking into account operations that matured in mid-December 2011, as well as shifts in demand in refinancing operations 
ahead of the two three-year operations, the net increase in liquidity as a result of the two three-year LTROs amounted to around 
•520 billion.Chart B Simplified Eurosystem balance sheet: liabilities(EUR billions)02004006008001,000

2013investment purposes) and domestic assets (investment portfolios), which are held outright by 
NCBs and are, de facto, not related to the implementation of monetary policy.2On the liabilities side of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet, items reflecting excess liquidity 

declined, given the ongoing repayment of funds borrowed through the three-year LTROs. Excess 

liquidity (defined as the liquidity provided in excess of the banking sector™s liquidity needs, as 

determined by autonomous factors and reserve requirements) hovered around •150-200 billion 

towards the end of 2013, down from the peak of •827.5 billion reached in the wake of those 

three-year LTROs on 5 March 2012. Banks kept the excess liquidity either in the deposit facility 

or in their current accounts: after the deposit rate was cut to zero in July 2012, banks became 

largely indifferent as to whether to transfer their excess liquidity to the deposit facility overnight 

or to leave it unremunerated as excess reserves on their current accounts Œ although a moderate 

bias in favour of the latter was observed within the overall trend of declining excess liquidity.In 2013 the Eurosystem continued to sterilise the liquidity injected via the Securities Markets 
Programme, which was terminated in September 2012. Banknotes in circulation maintained 

their shallow trend and, partly affected by seasonal factors, reached a new record high level 

of above •950 billion at the end of 2013. At the same time, government deposits (i.e. treasury 

departments™ deposits with NCBs) decreased by •35 billion. One reason for this decline in 

government deposits is that treasuries placed more funds with the banking system than in 2012. 

Finally, the impact of autonomous factors other than banknotes in circulation and government 

deposits declined, largely on account of lower claims on euro area residents denominated in euro 

(reflecting the provision of liquidity outside Eurosystem operations).Overall, between the peak recorded on 29 June 2012 and 27 December 2013, the Eurosystem™s balance sheet declined by around 26%, reaching around •2,300 billion. Taking a simplified 

presentation of the balance sheet,
3 this translates into a level slightly below •1,900 billion (see Charts A and B).The Eurosystem balance sheet and the money market
In the money market, the introduction of fixed rate full allotment tenders in October 2008 was 
accompanied by a transition from a regime of neutral liquidity to one of excess liquidity (see the 

area shaded in blue in Chart C). Under neutral liquidity conditions, i.e. in the case of near-zero 

excess liquidity, very short-term money market rates, in particular the EONIA, are anchored to 

the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operation. In situations marked by ample excess 

liquidity, by contrast, the EONIA is anchored to the ECB™s deposit facility rate.42 In addition, the Eurosystem gold reserves, which are revalued at market prices at the end of every quarter, have increased in value since 
the beginning of 2007 (also implying a corresponding increase in the revaluation accounts of the Eurosystem on the liabilities side). 
Those elements are not reflected in the simplified balance sheet in Charts A and B.3 The balance sheet presentation in Charts A and B differs from that of the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem as at 

31 December 2013, as presented in more detail in this Annual Report. In the simplified presentation of Charts A and B, a number of 
items are consolidated; for the underlying methodology, see the box entitled ﬁSimplified balance sheets: methodologyﬂ in the article 
entitled ﬁRecent developments in the balance sheets of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of Japanﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin, ECB, October 2009.4 The deposit rate provides a lower bound for the EONIA, as banks with access to the deposit facility are unlikely to lend on the money 

market at a less favourable rate than the deposit facility rate. See also the article entitled ﬁRecent developments in excess liquidity and 
money market ratesﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, January 2014.39ECBAnnual Report2013Notwithstanding the sizeable decline in excess liquidity Œ and hence in the size of the 
Eurosystem™s balance sheet Œ that occurred in 2013, the EONIA remained close to the deposit 

rate for most of the year, although it registered occasional small upward drifts in the last quarter 

of 2013. This increase in the EONIA, and its volatility, was related partly to seasonal or irregular 

factors, as well as to market liquidity developments, since money market fragmentation receded 

in parallel with the decline in excess liquidity. As a result, the EONIA started exhibiting a 

consistently higher responsiveness to market developments, while the overall impact of the 

decline in excess liquidity on very short-term interest rates can be deemed fairly limited. On 

occasions over 2013, however, expectations of a continued decline in excess liquidity shifted 

the expected path of the EONIA upwards. As a consequence of the reduction of the outstanding 

liquidity provided through monetary policy operations, the Eurosystem™s risk exposure also 

declined in 2013.Assessing the Eurosystem™s risk exposure
It is worth recalling that central banks always take on some financial risk when implementing 
monetary policy decisions. Monetary policy operations are associated with potential financial 

risk even in normal times, because they involve the provision of central bank money against 
assets or collateral originating from various economic agents. Depending on the magnitude of 

shocks and risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism, central banks may consider 

taking measures in pursuit of, and within the limits of, their respective mandates that increase 

their financial risk exposure in times of crisis. In the case of the Eurosystem, the risk profile in 

normal times is dominated mainly by risks associated with holdings of foreign exchange reserves 

and gold, while in times of tension its increased intermediation in euro area financial markets 

implies larger risk-taking associated with monetary policy operations.Chart C Aggregate liquidity needs and excess liquidity since 2007(EUR billions)0200400

2013However, central banks in general, and the Eurosystem in particular, have certain mechanisms 
in place which aim to protect their balance sheet against those risks.
5 Two elements contribute to ensuring this. First, the central bank manages the financial risks. For instance, the Eurosystem 

only provides credit through refinancing operations to counterparties that are considered 

financially sound and that are required to pledge adequate collateral assets, subject to haircuts 

commensurate with their risk, thereby ensuring two layers of protection against losses.
6 The risk management framework is evaluated and reviewed on an ongoing basis. For example, on 18 July 

2013 the ECB announced several measures aimed at maintaining adequate risk protection and 

improving the overall consistency of the framework.
7 Second, central banks create or build up 
financial buffers over time, which serve the purpose of making their balance sheet more resilient 

to the materialisation of potential losses (e.g. those incurred in the event of a counterparty 

defaulting on its central bank credit, the value of which would not be recovered in full).Financial buffers may be created by setting up provisions against risk, the size of which is 
determined by a risk assessment, or by retaining part of the annual profit for assignment to 

the central bank™s reserves. In addition to the financial buffers on their balance sheets, there 

are institutional arrangements supporting the integrity of the central bank™s balance sheet with 

the aim of ensuring that it will have sufficient financial resources available for the conduct of 

monetary policy in an independent manner, and will thus deliver on the policy objective. They 

relate to the concept of ﬁfinancial strengthﬂ, which Œ as defined by the BIS in a recent report
 Œ also includes the ﬁrisk transfer or insurance arrangements and, importantly, institutional design 

features that help maintain financial resources over timeﬂ.
8 Governments can contribute to the 
financial strength of the central bank by guaranteeing to cover any losses it may make and, 

eventually, to recapitalise it when necessary (i.e. what is known as ﬁfiscal backingﬂ) and by 

stipulating in law that the central bank will have sufficient resources to perform its tasks in the 

fulfilment of its mandate (financial independence and a prohibition on performing tasks not 

covered by its mandate).In the case of the Eurosystem, the institutional setting and the integrity of the Eurosystem™s 
balance sheet are reinforced in specific Treaty provisions; for example, Article 130 of the Treaty 

on the Functioning of the European Union states that the Eurosystem independently exercises 

its powers and carries out its tasks and duties. The principle of financial independence implies 

that a central bank must have sufficient means to perform its tasks, including the financing of 

its administration and operations.
9 In addition, Article 123(1) prohibits monetary financing 
 (see Section 6.1 of Chapter 2). These provisions together preclude the monetisation of sovereign 

debt, for instance by providing Member States with financial contributions in excess of their 

shares in the central bank™s profits realised in the respective financial year. In addition to 

these Treaty provisions, some Eurosystem central banks enjoy financial guarantees from their 

shareholders as part of their institutional arrangements.5 See also the box entitled ﬁCentral bank financial strength during the crisis: the case of the Eurosystemﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin, ECB, September 2013.6 The incurrence of losses requires the inability to recover outstanding credit either from the counterparty directly or through the 
realisation of the collateral held.7 See also the box entitled ﬁReview of the risk control frameworkﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, October 2013.8 According to this report, such arrangements may, among other things, take the form of fiscal backing or stand-alone financial strength. 

See Archer, D. and Moser-Boehm, P., ﬁCentral bank financesﬂ, BIS Papers, No 71, BIS, April 2013.9 This would also entail the separation of budgets; for example, the ECB™s budget is not part of the EU™s annual budget under Article 314 

of the Treaty. See also Case C-11/00, Commission v ECB, paragraph 132.41ECBAnnual Report2013Because (non-inflationary) financial resources are by definition limited in practice,
10 the only way of ensuring the availability of the necessary and sufficient financial resources for delivering 
price stability in all circumstances is to preserve the financial strength of the central bank in 

the long run. This helps eventually to entrench expectations among both the general public and 

financial market participants that the central bank will not be unduly constrained in the pursuit of 

its price stability objective by concerns about financial resources.10 See the discussion in Reis, R., ﬁThe mystique surrounding the central bank™s balance sheet, applied to the European crisisﬂ, 
American Economic Review: Papers & Proceedings 2013, Vol. 103(3), pp. 135-140.HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS INCREASED IN THE EURO AREA, BUT LESS MARKEDLY THAN IN THE UNITED STATESAAA-rated long-term government bond yields
 3 in the euro area increased from around 1.7% at the 
beginning of January 2013 to 2.2% at the end of December (see Chart 12). In the United States, 

yields on long-term government bonds rose more sharply over the same period, from around 
1.8% to around 3.1%. The development of government bond yields in 2013 can be broken down 
 into two periods.In the first phase, from January to early May, a weak macroeconomic outlook in the euro area, 
as suggested by business surveys and data releases on employment and manufacturing activity, 

weighed on AAA-rated euro area long-term government bond yields. Also, the conclusion of a 

financial assistance package for Cyprus and perceived domestic uncertainties in some euro area 

countries triggered renewed flight-to-safety 

flows in favour of highly rated government 

bonds. As a result, AAA-rated euro area 
 long-term government bond yields fell to 
historic lows of close to 1.5% on 2 May. Over 

the same period in the United States, ten-year 
government bond yields declined slightly 

less markedly in the light of more balanced  macroeconomic data releases.During the second phase from early May to the end of the year, interest rates in the market for 

AAA-rated long-term government bonds rose 

sharply in the euro area and in the United States, 

by 70 and 140 basis points respectively. In May 

and June alone, those interest rates increased in 
an almost synchronous manner by 60 and 80 
 basis points respectively, despite clear differences 
 both in the cyclical positions of the two regions 

and in the prospects for monetary policy. The 
increases largely reflected some statements 

by the US Federal Reserve that it would be 
appropriate, if the economy were to progress 

broadly as forecast, to moderate the pace of

2013bond purchases under its quantitative easing programme later in the year. This apparently led to a 
reassessment by markets of the future course of monetary policy not only in the United States, but 

also in other advanced economies. Generally, there was a marked spillover of the changing bond 

market conditions in the United States to the euro area. Accordingly, the resulting tightening of 

financial conditions was not warranted by underlying economic developments in the euro area.In July the ECB stated in its forward guidance that it expected key interest rates to remain at current 
or lower levels for an extended period of time. This forward guidance reduced the direct spillover 

from the United States. In August euro area long-term government bond yields increased again, 
but this time against the background of a gradual and broad-based improvement in the outlook for 

the euro area economy, as suggested especially by survey-based measures. In the United States, 

yields continued to rise perceptibly in July and August, against the background of broadly positive 

economic data releases and intensifying expectations of an imminent tapering of the Federal 

Reserve™s bond purchase programme.Since September, however, the movement of euro area long-term government bond yields has 
reversed somewhat, partly as a result of mixed macroeconomic data and the ECB™s decision in 

November to lower key monetary policy rates and reiterate its forward guidance. Overall, a 

change in market participants™ expectations of an imminent tapering of the Federal Reserve™s bond 

purchases may have contributed to a decline in yields until late autumn. That was a result of, among 

other things, some clarification by the Federal Reserve regarding what would influence its eventual 

decision to begin tapering and releases of US economic data that did not point conclusively to 

a firm and self-sustaining recovery of the US economy. In December US economic data again 

surprised on the positive side, and eventually the Federal Reserve announced that it would start 

to modestly reduce the pace of purchases as from January 2014. This announcement only had a 

small impact on long-term government bond 

yields, since it reduced uncertainty about the 

pace of reductions in bond purchases, and was 

accompanied by reinforced forward guidance 

on monetary policy rates. In the United States, 

yields have been fairly volatile in the period 

since September and were influenced both by 

increased uncertainty with respect to the future 

course of monetary policy and by the political 

tensions surrounding the negotiations over 

the federal debt limit. Owing to mostly strong 

economic data towards the end of the year and 

the announcement by the Federal Reserve that it 

would taper its bond purchase programme, long-

term government bond yields ended the year at 

the highest level observed during the year. A key feature of euro area government bond 
markets in 2013 was that long-term yields 

tended to converge across most euro area 

countries Œ a process that began with the 

steps undertaken towards a resolution of the 

euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2012 and 
the ECB™s announcement of Outright Monetary

and that on corresponding German government bonds.43ECBAnnual Report2013Transactions (see
 Chart 13). The convergence of yields took place against the background of 
tentative signs of a turnaround in economic activity, even in those countries that were experiencing 

the deepest recessions, and an improvement in perceptions of latent risks to financial stability. Even 

though the year was still characterised by the emergence of domestic uncertainties in a number of 

euro area countries, there were fewer spillovers of financial market stress between countries than 

often observed before. On a similar note, market conditions for bonds issued by low-rated sovereigns 

deteriorated only briefly when the Federal Reserve indicated its willingness to start scaling back its 

bond purchases and global financial market volatility spiked. That stood in contrast to more long-

lasting effects on the bond markets in emerging economies. Moreover, the effect on bond market 

conditions in the euro area was modest when the Federal Reserve announced in late December that 

it had decided to taper its bond purchase programme. Primary market conditions also improved in 

the stressed segments of government bond markets. Some euro area countries were able to extend 

their bond maturities after having increased their reliance on bonds with shorter maturities in 

2012, and two of the EU-IMF programme countries, Ireland and Portugal, made progress towards 
 regaining access to bond markets.In light of the tentative improvement in the economic outlook for the euro area, real yields on 
five and ten-year government bonds there increased over the year, namely by around 80 and 75 

basis points respectively, to around -0.1% and 0.5% at the end of 2013, while the real five-year 

yield five years ahead rose by around 70 basis points to around 1.1%. At the end of 2013 the 

five-year forward break-even inflation rate five years ahead implied by inflation-linked bonds 

stood at around 2.5%, slightly lower than at the beginning of the year. This was the result of a 
decline of 25 basis points in five-year break-even inflation rates, to around 1.2%, and a decrease 

of around 15 basis points in the ten-year break-even rate, to around 1.8%. By comparison, the 
five-year inflation swap rate five years ahead was close to 2.2%, likewise slightly lower than at the 

beginning of the year. Overall, after taking into 
account both the inflation risk and liquidity 

premia embodied in break-even inflation rates, 

market-based indicators suggest that inflation 

expectations remain fully consistent with the 

ECB™s price stability objective.EURO AREA EQUITY PRICES ROSE SHARPLY  IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2013Equity prices in the euro area and the United 
States rose by 20% and 30% respectively in 

2013 (see Chart 14). This compares with an 
increase of 57% in Japan. Many of the factors 

that shaped bond market developments also 

affected equity markets.In the first three months of 2013 euro area equity price developments were relatively 

muted, while stock prices rose in the United 
States. In the euro area, stock prices continued 

to benefit from the improvement in risk appetite 

that stemmed from the advances made in 2012 

in resolving the sovereign debt crisis, and from 

the ECB™s announcement of Outright Monetary

2013Transactions. In parallel, economic data releases for the euro area continued to disappoint and 
confirmed prospects for weak growth over the short term. In late spring euro area equity prices 

increased despite the continued release of weaker than expected data, including first quarter GDP 

figures and survey indicators. The favourable development of equity markets was driven by 

diminishing domestic uncertainties in some euro area countries, and by low yields on alternative 

investments such as government and corporate bonds. However, from late May, when expectations 

intensified that the Federal Reserve could soon begin to taper its bond purchases, equity prices 

declined sharply, most likely on grounds of fear that this might derail a fragile economic recovery 

in the euro area if financing conditions there were to tighten accordingly.In the United States, equity market sentiment was generally more positive than in the euro area in 
the first half of the year, with the S&P 500 index increasing by 13%, compared with a 1% increase 

for the Dow Jones EURO STOXX broad index. In the first few months political agreements to 

temporarily avoid the so-called fiscal cliff and raise the federal debt ceiling had a positive influence 

on market sentiment. Economic data releases were mixed, but generally improved towards the 

summer, suggesting a pick-up in economic activity. Speculation about the Federal Reserve™s 

forthcoming tapering of bond purchases had a negative impact, but it was less pronounced than 

that in the euro area, probably because any decision to taper would be closely linked to positive 

domestic economic developments there.In both economic areas, stock market uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility, rose when 
speculation about a reduced pace of bond purchases set in, but the change in implied volatility 

between early 2013 and the end of June was limited.In the first half of 2013 equity markets in emerging economies experienced declines in prices 
and came under selling pressure from foreign investors as uncertainty about the future stance of 

monetary policy in the United States increased. In Japan, equity prices were very volatile in the first 

part of the year. They initially increased sharply after the announcement of new monetary policy 

measures by the Bank of Japan and surprisingly strong GDP growth. In late spring, however, they 

declined in line with global equity markets, thereby limiting the overall increase.In the second half of the year equity price indices in the euro area and in the United States developed along more comparable lines, with the Dow Jones EURO STOXX index increasing by 19% and 

the S&P 500 by 15%. In addition, there was a significant decline in stock market uncertainty, as 

measured by implied volatility, in both economic areas.Equity markets in the euro area rallied in the context of the Governing Council™s communication on 
forward guidance and some tentative signs that the euro area economic recovery might be picking 

up. Stock market sentiment also remained highly sensitive to signals about the evolution of the 

Federal Reserve™s bond purchases and benefited, on average, from the postponement of the start 

of tapering. Another factor contributing to the increase in equity prices in the euro area was lower 

perceptions of financial stability risk, which helped euro area financial equity prices, in particular, to 

outperform the equity prices of non-financial companies. The advances towards the establishment 

of the Single Supervisory Mechanism under the auspices of the ECB and the expectation of more 

clarity on banks™ balance sheet quality with the forthcoming asset quality review, as well as progress 

with respect to the design of other elements of banking union, may also have benefited financial 

sector equities. In late December the eventual announcement by the Federal Reserve of its decision 

to taper its bond purchase programme was received positively, probably owing to the
 reduction in 
uncertainty, and the accompanying reinforcement of forward guidance. 45ECBAnnual Report2013In the United States too, equity prices increased in the second half of the year, but slightly less markedly than in the euro area. The upward movement of equity prices there was supported 

by a continued economic recovery, albeit at a moderate pace, and a continuation of the very 

accommodative monetary policy stance of the Federal Reserve. Akin to the reaction in the euro 

area, equity prices increased when the decision to taper the bond purchase programme was 
finally announced in late December. Concerns related to the federal debt ceiling agreement and 

the temporary shutdown of the central government gave rise to uncertainty and may have had a 

negative impact on equity prices for a while. Over the same period equity prices in Japan continued 

to rise, while equity prices in emerging market economies rebounded to some extent.The broad equity index in the United States reached an all-time high in March, and again on other 
occasions later in the year, while the broad Dow Jones EURO STOXX index at the end of 2013 

stood around 30% below its pre-crisis peak. Simple equity valuation measures seem to indicate that 

investors are willing to pay a higher price per unit of current earnings or dividends for US-based 
companies than for companies based in the euro area.4HOUSEHOLD BORROWING STABILISED IN 2013In 2013 the annual rate of change of total loans to households stabilised, standing at -0.2% in 

December 2013, broadly unchanged from the 0.2% observed in December 2012. This stabilisation 

was mirrored by similar developments in MFI loans to households (when adjusted for loan sales 

and securitisation). This apparent analogy reflects the fact that MFIs remain the main provider 

of loans to households, while the provision of loans to households by non-MFIs can largely be 

explained by the loan sales and securitisation activities of MFIs, which, depending on national 

accounting practices, result in household loans being shifted from the MFI sector to that of financial 

intermediaries other than insurance corporations and pension funds (OFIs). Lending for house purchase remained the main driver of growth in MFI loans to households. 
The annual growth rate of loans for house purchase, which had stood at 1.3% at the end of 

2012, was 0.7% in December 2013. The euro area growth rates mask significant cross-country 

heterogeneity that was again caused, as in the preceding year, by differing degrees of indebtedness 

in 2013, which resulted in varying deleveraging needs, by diverging economic situations and by 

disparities in banks™ ability and willingness to lend. Furthermore, the growth profile of lending 

to households for house purchase is likely to have reflected borrowers™ risk related to the general 

prospects for housing markets, as well as macroeconomic uncertainty. Housing market prospects 

were also identified in the euro area bank lending survey as an important driver of the decline 

in net demand for housing loans in the first half of 2013. The first net increase in demand for 

loans since the fourth quarter of 2010 was, however, partly reversed in the fourth quarter. From a 

supply-side perspective, the net tightening of credit standards declined in the course of 2013, as 

the ECB™s standard and non-standard policy measures (in particular, the two three-year LTROs, 

as well as the changes in the collateral framework) and the announcements of the Outright 

Monetary Transactions, as well as the forward guidance, helped to reduce financial fragmentation 

and generally eased the funding difficulties faced by a number of banks. This improvement eased 

constraints on banks™ lending to households. Banks™ lending rates for loans for house purchase 

stabilised throughout the euro area in the course of 2013, although the heterogeneity of such 

lending rates across countries remained sizeable.4 See, for example, the box entitled ﬁStock market developments in the light of the current low-yield environmentﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin
, ECB, August 2013.46ECBAnnual Report
2013After declining further in the first half of 
2013, the annual rate of change of consumer 

credit stabilised in the second half of the year. 
It remained in negative territory, however, 

standing at -3.1% in December 2013, 

after -2.9% in December 2012. The weak 

development of consumer credit was due 

largely to demand factors (which affect this 
form of lending in particular) and was, at the 

same time, in line with the results of consumer 

surveys. Subdued growth in households™ real 

disposable income and the fact that household 
indebtedness remained at very high levels in 

a number of euro area countries continued to 

dampen demand for consumer credit. In line 
with these findings, the bank lending survey 

reported both a net decline in demand in the first 

half of 2013, followed by a marginal increase in 

the third quarter and a subsequent slight decline 



easing of credit standards for this type of loan 



net tightening in the second half of 2013. The 

developments in demand for consumer credit 

were driven mainly by a smaller negative 
impact not only of household spending on 

durable goods, but also of consumer confidence 

and household saving. Banks™ lending rates for 
consumer credit generally stabilised in the third 

and fourth quarters of the year, although they 
remained higher than the levels prevailing in 

December 2012 (see Chart 15).HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS STABILISED AT HIGH LEVELSIn 2013 household indebtedness remained 

high, at levels observed since mid-2010. More 

particularly, the ratio of household debt to 

nominal gross disposable income was estimated 

at 98.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013, in 
line with the levels observed in mid-2010 

(see Chart 16). The development of this ratio 

reflected slight increases in total household debt 

and stagnating income, both of which mirrored 
the persistent weakness of economic activity and 

the high level of unemployment. The interest 

payment burden of households, expressed as 
a percentage of their gross disposable income, 

remained broadly unchanged in 2013, after

Data for the last quarter shown have partly been estimated.47ECBAnnual Report2013having gradually decreased between early 2012 and early 2013. The household debt-to-GDP ratio 
is estimated to have declined marginally, standing at 64.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared 

with 65.2% in the fourth quarter of 2012.FURTHER DECLINE IN THE COST OF EXTERNAL FINANCING FOR NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONSThe overall nominal cost of external financing for non-financial corporations decreased by 40
 basis 
points between the end of 2012 and the end of 2013 (based on three-month moving averages). 

The decline was due mainly to a considerable drop in the cost of equity, while the cost of market-

based debt and the cost of bank lending decreased somewhat (see Chart
 17). At the same time, 
heterogeneity across euro area countries remained significant.The overall improvement in financial market confidence and an increased risk appetite of 
investors contributed to a decline in the market-based cost of external financing for non-financial 

corporations in the first part of the year, i.e. up to May 2013, whereas the cost of bank lending for 
such corporations was broadly stable over this period. The downturn in the cost of market-based 

debt financing was partly reversed around the middle of the year, while the cost of equity moderated 

further. The cuts in monetary policy rates implemented since November 2011, which brought them 

to historically low levels in November 2013, contributed to easing the external financing costs of 

non-financial corporations, despite financial fragmentation across the euro area and sizeable risk 

premia related to weak economic conditions.With regard to the cost of bank-based financing, the short-term nominal cost of bank lending was 
unchanged in December 2013, as compared with the end of 2012, at 3.0% (based on three-month 

moving averages). Over the same period short-
term market rates increased slightly, with the 

three-month EURIBOR standing at 0.3% in 

December 2013, implying a small contraction 

of the spread between the two rates. The 
long-term cost of bank lending decreased by 

around 10 basis points (based on three-month 
moving averages) between the end of 2012 

and December 2013. The spread between the  long-term nominal cost of bank lending and the 

five-year overnight index swap rate narrowed 

by around 35 basis points over the period.While the cuts in the key ECB interest rates 
implemented in late 2011 and mid-2012 may 

have been reflected in lending rates by the 

end of 2013, the pass-through of the cuts in 

key ECB interest rates implemented in May 

and November 2013 may still be incomplete. 

Moreover, in some euro area countries, the 

transmission of the monetary policy stance 

through the bank lending channel remains 

constrained by the high risk aversion of banks 
towards borrowers of lesser creditworthiness. 

Banks in some jurisdictions may also have 
been reluctant to pass on key ECB interest

2013rate cuts in the context of deleveraging strategies and adjustments to meet higher regulatory 
capital requirements.The cost of market-based debt financing declined by around 20 basis points between the end 
of 2012 and December 2013 (based on three-month moving averages). It had fallen to historically 

low levels in the first part of the year, until May 2013, reflecting improved overall financial market 

sentiment, as well as investors™ increasing search for yield and generally rising risk appetite. In the 

second half of the year, however, it first increased somewhat in the context of higher uncertainty in 

financial markets about the future evolution of monetary policy in the United States, but declined 

again towards the end of 2013.The cost of issuing quoted equity declined considerably in 2013, standing around 125 basis points 
lower in December 2013 than at the end of 2012 (based on three-month moving averages). This 

decrease, which took place mainly in the second half of 2013, reflected stock price increases that 

were related to a general improvement in financial market sentiment, the Governing Council™s 

communication on forward guidance and tentative signs of an economic recovery in the euro area, 

as well as the reduction of uncertainty about the withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation in 

the United States.STILL SUBDUED RECOURSE TO EXTERNAL FINANCINGEuro area non-financial corporations™ recourse to external financing remained subdued in 2013. 

In terms of components, the decline in new MFI loans to non-financial corporations was partly 

offset by issuance of market-based debt, while 

issuance of quoted shares remained low. 

Overall, larger non-financial corporations™ 

market-based financing may have offered 

some relief in terms of their overall access 

to external financing, but remained a 

comparatively minor source of financing for 

euro area firms, on average.In more detail, loans to non-financial 
corporations declined further in 2013, the 

annual rate of change standing at -3.0% in 

December 2013, after -2.3% at the end of 
2012. The annual growth rate of debt securities 
issuance, although declining, remained high at 

8.5% in December 2013, compared with 14.2% 

at the end of 2012 (see Chart 18). Issuance of 
quoted shares remained low, with an annual 

growth rate of 0.7% in December 2013, 
compared with 0.5% in December 2012.The weakness of demand for external financing 
reflected the state of the business cycle.

and euro-denominated quoted shares issued by non-financial 

corporations.49ECBAnnual Report2013contracted in net terms in 2013, on the back of a still negative impact of fixed investment and 
subdued financing needs for inventories. At the same time, according to the evidence provided 

by the bank lending survey, the decline in net demand for loans by enterprises decelerated in the 

course of the year.Turning to the supply of credit, the euro area bank lending survey showed that euro area banks™ 
credit standards for loans to enterprises were tightened less in 2013 than in 2012. This reflected 

some tentative signs of stabilisation in credit conditions for firms. While borrowers™ risks in relation 

to the economic outlook remained dominant in explaining the tightening of credit standards, their 

impact became smaller over the year. In addition, the factors related to banks™ funding costs 

and balance sheet positions contributed to a slight net easing, on average, of credit standards 

during 2013, reflecting the improvement in funding conditions for euro area banks. With respect to 

small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), evidence from the survey on the access to finance of 

SMEs in the euro area (SAFE) indicated that their financing conditions were heterogeneous across 

euro area countries, with generally larger financing obstacles for SMEs in countries that were more 

strongly affected by the financial crisis.The movements in external financing flows recorded in 2013 suggest that some firms were able to 
diversify their sources of financing in response to still tight bank lending conditions. At the same 

time, such substitution away from bank financing remained limited to larger companies, which 

traditionally have greater access to corporate bond markets.GRADUAL CORPORATE DELEVERAGINGDeleveraging by the euro area corporate 

sector continued to take place gradually at 

the aggregate level in 2013. The weakness of 
economic activity and corporate profits may 

have prevented stronger deleveraging. The 

debt-to-GDP ratio of euro area non-financial 
corporations declined slightly, to 79% in the 

third quarter of 2013, from 80% at the end 

of 2012. Taking a longer-term perspective, the 

ratio has come down somewhat from the peak 

of 83% recorded in 2009-10 (see Chart 19).At the same time, a more nuanced picture can be obtained through a breakdown by euro 

area country, by sector of economic activity 

and by certain firm characteristics.
5 Indeed, deleveraging was more pronounced for firms in 

those euro area countries and sectors that had 
increased their debt most strongly prior to the 

financial crisis, in particular the construction 

and real estate services sectors. At the same 

time, corporate debt ratios remained high 

in these areas. In addition, as shown by the 

financial statements of firms, deleveraging has

2013been stronger in the case of firms with high initial levels of leverage, in particular smaller highly 
indebted firms. By contrast, the average leverage of firms with low levels of indebtedness has 

continued to increase since the start of the financial crisis.With respect to debt sustainability, the ability of firms to service their debt continued to be supported 
by the low interest rate environment and depressed corporate bond yields. The net interest payment 

burden declined further in 2013, to levels below the historical average recorded over the period 

since 2000. At the same time, firms with a high share of debt financed at variable interest rates 

remain exposed to changes in short-term financing conditions.2.3 PRICE AND COST DEVELOPMENTSIn 2013 headline HICP inflation in the euro area was 1.4%, on average, compared with 2.5% in 

2012 and 2.7% in 2011. This marked decrease in the course of 2013 took place slightly faster than 

expected and reflected primarily the strong decline in energy and food price inflation.As evidenced by developments in producer prices and survey data, pipeline pressures in the supply 
chain eased further throughout 2013. Industrial producer price inflation turned slightly negative in 

2013, to stand at -0.2% on average, compared with an annual average of 2.8% in 2012. Oil price 
developments and the unwinding of the spike in international food prices over the summer of 2012 

were the main factors behind this decline. Domestic cost pressures stemming from labour costs remained subdued in the first three quarters 
of 2013, in line with the continued weakness in labour markets. The relatively smooth pattern of 

wage growth at the euro area level concealed substantial divergence in wage developments across 

countries. Consumer inflation perceptions and short-term inflation expectations came down slightly in 2013 
compared with 2012 and 2011. Longer-term inflation expectations, according to survey data, 

were very stable, remaining firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council™s aim of keeping 

inflation below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.HICP INFLATION DECREASED MARKEDLY IN 2013The marked decrease in euro area annual HICP inflation in 2013 was attributable primarily to the 

sharp decline in energy price inflation as of October 2012. A rapid fall in food price inflation in the 

second half of the year also played a role. However, excluding the volatile components food and 

energy, HICP inflation moderated in an environment of weak economic activity (see Table
 1 and Chart 20).The annual rate of change in the energy component, which carries a weight of 11.0% in the HICP basket of goods and services, fell substantially in the course of 2013, recording a 12-month average 

of 0.6%, compared with 7.6% in 2012. This was mainly the result of falling oil prices in US dollar 

terms and the appreciation of the euro. In the latter part of the year the squeeze on refining margins 

also contributed to the overall downward trend, which nevertheless exhibited some volatility, 

owing to oil price developments, and positive and negative base effects. The greatest impact of 

these factors was on the prices of items derived directly from oil, such as liquid fuels, fuels and 

lubricants for personal transport equipment, although the prices of electricity, gas and heating fuel 

were also affected.51ECBAnnual Report2013Reflecting developments in both international food commodity prices and local supply conditions, 
the annual rate of change in food prices remained at the high level of around 3% for the first eight 

months of 2013. From August, food price inflation declined quite rapidly, as the earlier upward 

impact of adverse weather conditions on fruit and vegetable prices unwound. This development 

reflected, in particular, the profile of unprocessed food price inflation, which had increased at 

an annual rate of close to 5% in the first half of the year and was also the fastest-growing main 

component of the overall HICP in the year as a whole, with an average rate of change of 3.5%. 

This was markedly higher than in 2012 (3.0%) and 2011 (1.8%). By contrast, processed food price

2013inflation declined from the autumn of 2011. The average annual rate of change of 2.2% in 2013 was 
markedly lower than that in 2012 (3.1%) and 2011 (3.3%). The gradual decline was interrupted in 
July and August, when processed food prices increased at a rate of 2.5%, which was slightly above 

average and mostly reflected a sharp rise in the annual rate of change in tobacco prices. This impact 

was reversed from October 2013. As a result, processed food price inflation dropped to 2.1% in the 

fourth quarter.Average HICP inflation, excluding the volatile components food and energy, moderated during 
2013, albeit to a much lesser extent than headline inflation. While HICP inflation excluding these 

components was 1.5%, on average, in 2012, it fell to close to 1% in the second half of 2013. The two 

main components of the HICP basket excluding food and energy items, i.e. non-energy industrial 

goods and services, recorded lower than expected annual rates of change in late 2013, reflecting 

overall subdued demand conditions. After exhibiting some volatility in the first few months of the 

year, non-energy industrial goods price inflation hovered at a rather low level from July
 2013. This 
pattern can be attributed to the very low, and occasionally even negative, annual rates of change 

in the prices of garments and footwear, which were the result of the winter and summer sales. 

More generally, weak demand continued to dampen the prices of non-energy industrial goods, 

especially durable goods, such as cars. The annual rate of change in the services component, which 

is the largest component of the HICP, was relatively constant throughout most of 2013. After a 

period of volatility in March and April, owing to the timing of Easter, services price inflation 

stabilised at 1.4% between June and September, before easing further to 1.2%, on average, in the  fourth quarter of the year. PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN 2013Throughout 2013 pipeline pressures in the supply chain eased further at the producer level. 
Annual producer price inflation continued its downward trend, owing to declining oil and 
 non-oil commodity prices. The volatility in the 

monthly profile mainly reflected positive and 

negative base effects related to energy and food 

price developments one year earlier. Pipeline 

pressures on non-energy industrial goods prices 
remained relatively stable at subdued levels, 

while those on food prices moderated in the 
first half of the year, before falling towards 
the autumn.The annual rate of change in producer prices 
for industrial goods (excluding construction) in 

the euro area turned negative in 2013, to stand 

at -0.2% on average, down from 2.8% in 2012 

and 5.7% in 2011. The annual rate of change in 

industrial producer prices excluding construction 

and energy also declined further in 2013, to 

0.4% on average, compared with 1.4% in 2012 

and 3.8% in 2011. The easing of price pressures 

was more visible at the earlier stages of the price 

chain (producer prices for intermediate goods) 

than at the later stages (producer prices for 
 consumer goods) (see Chart 21).Chart 21 Breakdown of industrial producer

of 2013, in line with the continued weakness in euro area labour markets. Having shown some signs 

of moderation in 2012 compared with 2011, growth in labour costs picked up slightly in the first 

quarter of 2013 at the euro area level, before slowing again in the second and third quarters. The 

relatively smooth pattern of wage growth at the euro area level concealed substantial divergences 

in wage developments across countries. While nominal wages grew at robust rates in countries with 

relatively resilient labour markets, nominal wages and unit labour costs grew only slightly, or even 

declined, in countries implementing fiscal consolidation measures and experiencing persistently 

high levels of unemployment.Euro area negotiated wages slowed in the course of 2013, growing at 1.7%, year on year, in the 
second and third quarters, compared with an annual average of 2.2% in 2012. The annual rate of 
growth in compensation per employee was 1.6% in the first three quarters of 2013, which was 
slightly lower than the average of 1.7% in 2012 (see Table 2). Other wage indicators, such as hourly 

labour cost growth, decreased substantially in 2013 by comparison with what was seen in 2012, 

primarily owing to the marked increase in hours worked. Overall, wages and salaries grew at a 

much faster rate than the non-wage component of euro area hourly labour costs.After stagnating in 2012, labour productivity growth per employee recovered only slightly in the 
first three quarters of 2013, increasing to around 0.3% on average. This slight pick-up, together 

with the decrease in the annual rate of change of compensation per employee, led to a slowdown 

in unit labour cost growth, to 1.1% year on year in the third quarter, compared with 1.7% in 2012.Following the rebound that had started in mid-2009, corporate profits remained broadly unchanged 
in 2011 and 2012. After moderate improvements in previous quarters, profit levels went up more 

significantly from the second quarter of 2013. Reflecting the increase in unit labour cost growth 

and the adverse economic conditions, the annual rate of change in corporate profits was negative 

throughout 2012 and turned positive in the first quarter of 2013. This rebound in corporate profit 

growth is attributable mainly to a rise in unit profits (i.e. the margin per unit of output).Table 2 Labour cost indicators(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated)2010201120122012Q32012Q42013Q12013Q22013Q3Negotiated wages1.72.02.22.22.21.91.71.7Hourly labour cost index1.52.21.92.01.61.91.11.0Compensation per employee1.92.11.72.01.51.61.61.6Memo items:Labour productivity2.41.30.0-0.1-0.3-0.20.40.5Unit labour costs-0.60.81.72.11.81.81.21.1Sources: Eurostat, national data and ECB calculations.54ECBAnnual Report
2013RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES BOTTOMED OUTEuro area residential property prices, which 
are not included in the HICP, started to decline 

in the autumn of 2011 (see Chart 22). In the 

third quarter of 2013 they fell by 1.4% year on 
year, which was less than in the first and the 
second quarters (-2.8% and -2.4% respectively). 
This could be indicative of a bottoming-out 

in the annual rate of change in house prices. 
Significant divergence in annual house price 

growth among the euro area countries was also 
observed in 2013. While annual house price 

growth was negative and continued to decline in 

many euro area countries, it remained positive 

in Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, 
Luxembourg and Austria.DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION EXPECTATIONSData from Consensus Economics, the Euro Zone 

Barometer and the ECB Survey of Professional 

Forecasters show that survey-based longer-

term inflation expectations (five years ahead) 

were close to 2.0% in 2013. Market-based indicators, such as long-term break-even inflation rates 

derived from inflation-linked bonds and comparable rates extracted from inflation-linked swaps, 

were also fully consistent with the Governing Council™s definition of price stability.62.4 OUTPUT, DEMAND AND LABOUR MARKET DEVELOPMENTSECONOMIC ACTIVITY STARTED TO RECOVER IN THE COURSE OF 2013Following an extended period of weakness, economic activity in the euro area started to improve in 

the course of 2013 (see Table 3). Domestic demand strengthened gradually in line with improving 

business and consumer sentiment, albeit from low levels. Private consumption was affected by the 

adverse impact of falling employment on aggregate income, particularly at the beginning of the 

year. This was offset later in the year by the positive impact on real income from falling commodity 

prices. Investment, which benefited from declining uncertainty, continued to be hampered by 

ongoing deleveraging needs, in both the financial and non-financial sectors, as well as by credit 

supply constraints. Continuing low rates of capacity utilisation and subdued demand prospects are 

additional elements that are likely to have constrained investment. Meanwhile, public consumption 

was held back by continued fiscal consolidation efforts in several euro area countries, although the 

overall fiscal stance was less restrictive than in 2012. There was also a turnaround in the inventory 

cycle in 2013 as the strong adjustment that started in the second half of 2011 came to an end. At 

the same time, external trade continued to contribute positively to euro area real GDP growth in 

2013. Overall, a weak first quarter of the year, together with a negative carry-over effect from 

the previous year of 0.5%, led to a further reduction in GDP of 0.4% for 2013 as a whole. This 

compares with a fall of 0.7% in 2012.6 For further details, see the box entitled ﬁThe anchoring of long-term inflation expectations in the euro areaﬂ,

euro area real GDP contracted by a further 0.2% in the first quarter of 2013. The decline in output 

in the first quarter was partly exacerbated by cold weather in parts of Europe, which mainly affected 

activity in the construction sector. In the second quarter of 2013 output rose by 0.3%, quarter 
 on quarter, thereby rising for the first time in six quarters. This increase was partly attributable 

to temporary factors affecting output in some countries, notably the rebound in construction 
activity from its weakness in the first quarter, as well as high energy consumption in response 

to an unusually cold spring. The level of output rose by a further 0.1% on a quarterly basis in the 

third quarter, in line with developments in short-term indicators. This was partly on the back of a 

continued increase in domestic demand (excluding changes in inventories), which outpaced net 

trade in terms of quarterly contributions to GDP growth for the first time since the first quarter 

of 2011. Eurostat™s first estimate for the fourth quarter puts the quarter-on-quarter change in real 

GDP at 0.3%. No breakdown is available for the fourth quarter as yet, but the latest information 

points towards a continued positive contribution from domestic demand alongside a moderate 

positive contribution from net exports.DOMESTIC DEMAND IMPROVED AFTER A SLOW START TO THE YEARPrivate consumption posted positive, albeit modest, growth rates in both the second and third 

quarters of the year, following six quarters of contraction. Developments in consumption were in 

line with the continued reduction in real disposable income. However, despite a stronger fall in 

employment, the decline in real disposable income was smaller in 2013 than in 2012. This is partly 

explained by the less restrictive fiscal policy stance and the fall in commodity prices, both of which 

supported real household income. At the same time, households drew on their savings in order to 

lessen the effect of lower disposable income on spending patterns. As a result, the saving ratio fell

2013slightly further in 2013, reaching unprecedented 
low levels. The indicator of consumer 

confidence, which provides a reasonably good 

indication of trends in consumption, improved 

markedly throughout 2013, more than making 

up for the sharp fall in the second half of 

2012. However, confidence only returned to a 

level close to its long-term average at the end 

of 2013 (see Chart 23). Looking at the year as 
a whole, private consumption declined further, 

albeit not as sharply as in 2012. This very much 

reflected a carry-over effect from depressed 

developments in 2012 and weak growth at the 
beginning of 2013.Following eight quarters of negative growth, 
dynamics in investment strengthened in the 

course of 2013, with positive quarterly growth 

rates being recorded in both the second and 
third quarters of 2013. This improvement, 

which reflected developments in both 

construction and non-construction investment, 
took place alongside rising business sentiment 
and declining uncertainty. At the same time, 

the ongoing deleveraging process and balance sheet restructuring needs on the part of both firms 

and banks in some countries, as well as the continuing high oil price, again dampened investment 

in 2013. Box 4 reviews some stylised facts about so-called creditless recoveries in the context of 
recent developments. Further adjustments in the housing markets in most regions also exerted 

downward pressure on residential investment. In 2013 as a whole, investment declined by less than 

in 2012, when it contracted by more than 4%. This annual decline is fully explained by a negative 

carry-over effect from weak growth in 2012, coupled with a poor start to the year.Chart 23 Confidence indicators(percentage balances; seasonally adjusted)-40-35

to the private sector are a key factor for financing investment and consumption, particularly in 

bank-based financial systems such as that of the euro area. Thus it has been argued that weak 

credit growth resulting from deleveraging needs in the private sector, weak credit demand or 

constraints in the supply of credit may dampen the economic recovery in the euro area. At the 

same time, historical evidence suggests that, initially, output can also recover in the absence 

of credit growth. This box reviews some stylised facts about such ﬁcreditlessﬂ recoveries and 

provides some evidence on recent developments and the empirical relationship between output 

and loan growth in the euro area.57ECBAnnual Report2013Creditless recoveriesThe prospects for economic activity in the absence of credit growth have been a subject of 
public debate in recent years, particularly in those euro area countries with significant balance 

sheet problems that have been undergoing an adjustment process. The literature shows that 

recoveries in output without a coincident pick-up in credit are not rare events. Recent empirical 

research on a sample of advanced, emerging and low-income countries suggests that one in five 

recoveries is creditless.1 The fact that such recoveries tend to be more frequent after a banking or currency crisis suggests that impaired financial intermediation may play an important role in the 

sluggishness of credit growth.Creditless recoveries are typically preceded by large declines in economic activity and by 
financial stress, particularly if private sector indebtedness is high and the country is reliant 

on foreign capital inflows.2 Creditless recoveries tend to be relatively weak, with average 
real GDP growth rates being around a third lower than during recoveries associated with a 

normal development of credit. Activity in sectors that are more dependent on external finance 

is also comparatively more curtailed during creditless recoveries. Investment Œ which is more 

dependent on credit than consumption Œ makes a disproportionately small contribution to 

growth in creditless recoveries relative to other recoveries, although consumption also tends 

to be weaker.There are various explanations for the 
phenomenon of rebounding output growth 

without credit. For example, recoveries 

may be financed by alternative sources of 

financing, such as retained earnings, securities 

issuance or inter-company credit (including 

across borders). Moreover, a reallocation of 

economic activity to less credit-dependent 

sectors, or the take-up of unused production 
capacity, may help firms to increase their 

output in the absence of credit growth.Economic recoveries and loan growth  in the euro area
Comparing the current cycle with earlier 
downturns shows that real loan growth both 

to firms and to households has fallen by more 
in the most recent recession than in the other 

recessions that have occurred since the 1990s 
(see Chart A). An extended period of low 

credit supply to firms, especially new firms, 

may create barriers to entry, thereby having 
a negative impact on growth in total factor

2013productivity. While the weakness in loans 
to non-financial corporations continued, a 

turning point in real household loan growth 
appears to have taken place in 2013. This 
seems to have broadly coincided with a 
turning point in real GDP growth, which is 

in line with historical patterns. An analysis 

based on simple correlations suggests that real 

loans to non-financial corporations tend to 

lag behind annual real GDP growth by three 

to four quarters, while the growth of loans to 

households broadly coincides with annual 

growth in real GDP (see Chart B). An analysis 

based on turning points implies similar lead/lag 
 relationships with reference to peaks and 

troughs.3 However, these correlations are not perfectly stable, and specific factors, such 

as those typically associated with creditless 

recoveries, may imply deviations from 
historical regularities. There are some signs that euro area firms 
have partially compensated for weak loans
 Œ 
reflecting firms™ and banks™ deleveraging 

needs Œ with other financing sources since the 

start of the crisis in 2008 (see Chart C). Firms 
have Œ at least partially Œ offset the drop in 

bank financing by increasing their issuance of 
debt securities. Nevertheless, the number of 
firms issuing debt securities is relatively small, 

and they are often larger in size and unevenly 

spread across euro area countries and sectors. 

Though alternative sources of financing, such 

as the issuance of debt securities and equities, 

as well as loans from other sectors, have 

partly made up for weak MFI loan growth, the 
total amount of financing provided to firms 

as a percentage of GDP has been lower over 

the past few years than in previous cycles. 

To some extent, this reflects the ongoing 

necessary correction of past excesses in debt 

accumulation, especially in certain countries 

and sectors, and illustrates the fact that credit 

conditions have been far tighter during the 

crisis than in previous recessions. 3 See the box entitled ﬁStylised facts of money and credit over the business cycleﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, October 2013.Chart B Correlations at different leads/lags:growth in real loans to households and

are essentially the only source of external 

financing. Although growth in such loans 

to households has declined substantially 

over recent years (see Chart D), flows have 

remained positive, in contrast to those to the 

corporate sector. To conclude, the real growth rate of loans 
has been considerably lower in recent years 

than in the past for all levels of GDP growth. 

In addition to demand factors Œ such as the 
low level of investment Œ constraints in the 

supply of financing also play a role in the 

weakness of credit growth. Nevertheless, there 
are no indications thus far that the cyclical 

relationship between the business cycle and 

loans to the private sector is out of line with 
historical regularities observed for the euro 

area. At the same time, there are some signs 

that firms, in particular, have tried to substitute 

loans with other financing sources during the 

recent crisis. These are typical features of a 

recovery following a balance sheet crisis. Chart D Euro area households™ external

The recovery in public spending was largely the result 

of the pace of fiscal consolidation slowing in a number of euro area countries. In particular, the 

reduction in compensation of government employees, which accounts for about half of total 

government consumption in the euro area, seems to have come to a halt. Social transfers in kind 

continued to rise broadly in line with the trend in previous years. Intermediate consumption 

expenditure remained broadly constant in 2013. Finally, there was a turnaround in the inventory cycle in 2013 as the strong inventory adjustment 
that started in the second half of 2011 came to an end. The euro area returned to moderate restocking 
in the course of the year. As a result, the contribution of inventories to growth is likely to have been 

close to neutral in 2013 for the year as a whole, compared with a negative contribution in 2012 

(-0.5 percentage point of GDP) and positive contributions in 2011 and 2010 (0.3 and 0.6 percentage 

point of GDP respectively).NET TRADE CONTINUED TO HOLD UPExternal trade continued to contribute positively to euro area real GDP growth in 2013. The 

contribution to growth from net trade was weaker than in 2012 as export growth slowed, while 

imports started to recover in the second quarter of the year after falling considerably in 2012. The 

lower export growth, while still positive for the year as a whole, reflects weak foreign demand and, 60ECBAnnual Report
2013to a lesser extent, the impact of the appreciation 
of the euro in nominal effective terms. 

Nevertheless, continued improvements in price 

competitiveness in the wake of the ongoing 

rebalancing process supported export growth 

in several euro area countries (see Box 5). 
 At the same time, the current account surplus 

widened further on the back of the positive 
contribution to GDP growth from net trade. 

Looking at the geographical breakdown, exports 

to EU Member States outside the euro area 
picked up notably, while trade with Asia and 

the United States failed to gain momentum 
 (see Chart 24). Intra-euro area trade showed 
signs of a nascent recovery in the second half 

of the year. Although annual import growth in 
the euro area was subdued in 2013, a recovery 
began in the second quarter following two 

years of a trend decline. The recovery was 

broadly in line with the gradual recovery in 
domestic demand and was also supported by the 
appreciation of the euro.Chart 24 Euro area export volumes

between 1999 and 2012. It reviews the export market performance by calculating euro area exports 

of goods and services relative to world exports, in terms of both volume and value. The analysis 

of export market shares in volume terms might offer some insights that are useful when assessing 

a country™s price competitiveness at the macroeconomic level, as these shares may be relevant 

for GDP growth and can be expected to react directly to changes in price competitiveness. Shares 

in value terms, which partially capture terms of trade developments, may be more suitable for 

assessing income generated from exports and can be affected by changes in either volumes or 

values. Finally, export shares expressed in value terms may be affected somewhat differently by 

movements in the exchange rate compared with export shares in volume terms.1Euro area export market sharesThe extra-euro area export market share of goods and services in value terms decreased from 
18.8% in 1999 to 15.5% in 2012 in a context of the rapid integration of emerging markets into 

the world economy (see Chart A).21 It needs to be acknowledged that a simple export market share analysis is not able to capture the impact of globalisation on international 
production systems. For instance, for countries that use offshoring strategies, export market shares will be lower if sales are undertaken 
mainly from foreign affiliates rather than domestic parent companies.2 Over the period 1999-2012 the export market share of emerging economies surged from 25.7% to 43.8% in value terms.61ECBAnnual Report2013The dynamics of the export market share of 
goods and services in value terms were mainly 

driven by trade in goods, as it accounts for 

around three-quarters of euro area exports. 
Between 1999 and 2008 the decline in the 

extra-euro area market share for goods 

amounted to 9.3%, whereas that for services 
was milder, standing at 5.3% (see Chart A). 

The declining trend in export market shares 

continued after 2009 for both goods and 

services. In volume terms, however, between 1999 and 
2008 the extra-euro area export market share in 

goods and services dropped less pronouncedly 
than in value terms, declining by 2.5% 

(see Charts A and B). Since 2009 the extra-
euro area export market share in volume terms 

has rebounded, recording a cumulative rise of 

3.3% up to 2012. The gains in volume terms 

were mainly driven by positive developments 

in German export volumes, which remained 

resilient, and by the efforts of a number of member countries to improve competitiveness 
 (see Chart B). However, over the period 1999-2012 the extra-euro area market share declined by 

2.8% in volume terms.Chart A Extra-euro area export market

2013The differences in market share developments observed, depending on whether value or volume 
data are used, reflect relative price developments. If the loss of export market share in value 

terms is larger than in volume terms, it suggests that the export prices of the country in question 
increased less than the world export prices. Over the period 1999-2012 the euro area™s losses of 

export market share in goods and services in volume terms (2.8%) were less pronounced than in 

value terms (17.7%), suggesting that prices of euro area exports increased less than world export 

prices (see Chart B). This may be related to a loss in euro area terms of trade, possibly owing to 

relative commodity price increases.3Developments in export market shares of euro area countriesBetween 1999 and 2012 most euro area countries recorded a loss in their export market shares 
for goods and services in both volume and value terms. However, differences across countries 

can be observed (see Chart B). In particular, between 1999 and 2008 Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia and Germany gained 
export market share both in value and volume terms.4 Germany and Slovenia gained more in volume terms than in value terms (see Chart B). This suggests that export prices of those 

countries increased less than world export prices, reflecting for Germany domestic wage growth 

moderation. Austria and Finland also improved their relative price competitiveness as they 

gained in volume terms. Over the same period Malta, Spain, Cyprus, Italy and the Netherlands 

experienced slightly higher losses in export shares in volume terms than in value terms, pointing 

to losses in price competitiveness. Greece experienced pronounced losses in volume terms, 

indicating that export prices for Greek products grew faster than world export prices, leading to 

a continuous loss of price competitiveness. For some of these economies, the decline in export 

market shares could be explained by the fact that they were booming during this period, and 

therefore their incentive to sell abroad was smaller. The opposite trend was apparent in France, 

Belgium, Ireland and Portugal, which lost more in value terms, gaining price competitiveness 
marginally in relative terms.Between 2009 and 2012 some euro area economies (Belgium, France, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Cyprus) experienced a much less pronounced decline in their export market shares in volume 

terms than in value terms. While the export market share in value terms also declined for Spain 

and the Netherlands, their export market share in volume terms stabilised. These developments 

reflect the general efforts to regain or maintain competitiveness in many of these economies, and 

the incentive of some of these economies to sell more abroad, since domestic demand remained 

weak over the same period.Between 2009 and 2012 Germany™s export market share remained resilient, reflecting further 
improvements in its relative price competitiveness. Estonia and Slovakia registered positive 

growth in their export market shares, which was more pronounced in volume terms. Malta™s 

share grew marginally in volume terms, while in Portugal the decline in both volume and value 
3 Price factors only partly explain developments in export market shares. It should be noted that over a longer time horizon other non-
price factors are found to also contribute to the evolution of export performance (see ﬁCompetitiveness and the export performance 
of the euro areaﬂ, Occasional Paper Series, No 90, ECB, June 2005). See also Dieppe et al. (2011), di Mauro and Forster (2008), Benkovskis and Wörz (2012), Antras et al. (2010) and Altomonte et al. (2013).4 Slovakia™s export market share gains also reflect non-price competitiveness factors (the country™s ability to attract sizeable foreign 

direct investment inflows and its integration in the production of components in the automotive and electronic sectors). However, there 
might also be some statistical bias owing to exchange rate conversion issues prior to Slovakia™s entry into the euro area.63ECBAnnual Report2013terms was similar. While experiencing growth in export market shares in volume terms before 
the crisis, Austria, Finland and Slovenia witnessed a deterioration in their export market shares 

between 2009 and 2012. This fall in export market shares was smaller in volume terms than in 

value terms.Decomposing the growth in the value of export market shares into goods and services, the 
exports of services tend to outperform the exports of goods in value terms when measured as 

a share of total world exports. Between 1999 and 2008 most euro area countries recorded a 

loss in their export market shares of goods, with the exception of Slovakia, Estonia and Greece 
 (see Chart C).
5 For Austria, Germany and Slovenia, the contribution of goods to the change 
in total export market share was neutral. Over the same period, for Luxembourg, Ireland, 
Finland, Malta, Estonia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Greece, Germany and Portugal, services contributed 

positively to the growth of export market shares. Between the onset of the financial crisis and 

2012 these gains were reversed, and there was a general decline of export market shares for both 

goods and services, with services remaining relatively more resilient than goods. Overall, the euro area has been faced with a general decline in export market shares, linked to 
the emergence of developing countries. However, some positive developments in volume terms 

since the onset of the crisis reveal a relative improvement in euro area price competitiveness. 

At the country level, this is reflected in the improvement of competitiveness in several member 

countries and in the resilience of German exports. While goods contributed more to the decline 

of export market shares, services appear to have been more resilient.5 The percentage contributions of goods and services to total export market share growth are computed by weighting the percentage 
growth of export market shares in goods and services by their respective shares in a country™s total exports (the shares are calculated in 
the initial year of the reference period).Chart C Contributions of goods and services to export market shares(annual data; percentage change; in value terms)-40-30

2013ACTIVITY IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR INCREASED SLIGHTLYDespite some volatility, activity in the industrial 
sector improved somewhat throughout the year, 
in line with the gradual recovery in GDP. In 

December 2013 industrial production (excluding 

construction) stood 0.5% above its level one 

year earlier, whereas in December
 2012 it had 
been 2.4% below its level at the same time 

the year before. Among the components of 
industrial production (excluding construction), 
intermediate goods recorded the strongest 

increase in 2013 (see
 Chart 25). However, value 

added in industry (excluding construction) 

declined on an annual basis, falling by 1.2% 

on average during the first three quarters of the 
year, compared with a contraction of 1.1% in 

2012.Construction production declined further 
in 2013, continuing its extended period of 
weakness. After a decline of 4.2% in 2012, value 
added in construction fell by 4.5% on average, 

year on year, in the first three quarters of 2013 

(based on seasonally adjusted data). Meanwhile, 
value added in services, which remained stable 

in 2012, recorded a modest decline of 0.1% 
during the same period.LABOUR MARKETS BOTTOMED OUT IN 2013Headcount employment, which declined by 

0.7% in 2012, fell further in 2013 (see Chart 26). 
As a result, in the third quarter of 2013 euro area 

employment stood about 0.8% below its level 

one year earlier. However, quarter-on-quarter 

employment developments show that the labour 

market situation has stabilised. Headcount 

employment remained broadly stable, quarter 

on quarter, in the second and third quarters of 
2013. These developments followed seven 

consecutive quarters of decline. Moreover, 

survey results have improved in the course of 
the year, pointing to a stable or slightly positive 

rate of job creation in the fourth quarter of 
2013. Overall, employment is likely to have 

fallen by around 1% in 2013 as a whole. From 
a sectoral perspective, this decline in headcount 

employment was broadly based across the 

main sectors.Chart 25 Industrial production

employment in 2013. This suggests that many firms continued to reduce their labour input by cutting 

hours worked per person rather than by reducing headcount. This pattern of reduced working hours 
appears to have reversed in the latter half of 2013, which would be in line with indications of a 

gradual improvement in the labour market, where a normalisation of hours worked often precedes 

renewed hiring.As labour market developments tend to lag behind overall cyclical developments, the decline in 
employment growth was greater than that in output growth. This implies that annual productivity 

growth per person rose from -0.3% in the last quarter of 2012 to +0.5% in the third quarter of 2013. 
The average annual growth rate over the first three quarters of the year was 0.2%, which compares 

with no growth in the previous year. The increase in productivity growth affected all sectors. As 

a result of the sharper decline in hours worked than in jobs, annual growth in overall productivity 

measured by hours worked stood at 0.7% on average during the first three quarters of 2013, which 

is similar to the growth rate recorded in 2012.After bottoming out in the first half of 2011, the euro area unemployment rate continued to increase 
in 2012 and the first three quarters of 2013, reaching levels not seen since the start of the series in 

1995. However, the increase in 2013 was not as sharp as in 2012, and was halted by a small decline 

in the unemployment rate in October (see Chart 26). Thereafter, the unemployment rate remained 

stable at 12.0% until the end of 2013, despite an ongoing decline in the number of unemployed. 

Nevertheless, in December the unemployment rate stood more than 2 percentage points above its 

trough of April 2011. For 2013 as a whole the unemployment rate averaged 12.1%, compared with 

11.4% in 2012.2.5 FISCAL DEVELOPMENTSThe euro area government deficit is expected to have declined further in 2013, reflecting sizeable 

consolidation efforts in most countries. Compared with its peak in 2009, the euro area-wide 

deficit has more than halved. After several years of comprehensive and often painful budgetary 

adjustments, the euro area has made relatively more progress in restoring sound fiscal positions 

than other major advanced economies. However, general government debt-to-GDP ratios are 

still very high and, in many countries, have not yet stabilised. The euro area™s main fiscal policy 

challenge is, therefore, to sustain fiscal consolidation over the medium term. This is necessary to 

reduce excessive debt ratios and create fiscal buffers against future shocks, particularly in light of 

the detrimental impact of ageing populations on public finances.FISCAL CONSOLIDATION IN 2013 
According to the European Commission™s autumn 2013 economic forecast, the aggregate general 

government deficit for the euro area is expected to have declined by 0.6 percentage point, to 3.1% 

of GDP in 2013 (see Table 4). The reduction in the budget deficit in 2013 was largely driven by 

a 0.5 percentage point increase in the government revenue ratio, to 46.7% of GDP. This reflected, 

in particular, a broadening of tax bases and increases in tax rates in several countries. At the same 
time, the expenditure ratio declined only marginally (by 0.1 percentage point), to 49.8% of GDP. The average general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio for the euro area is expected to have 
increased significantly, from 92.7% in 2012 to 95.7%, albeit at a slower pace than in 2012. 

According to the European Commission™s autumn 2013 economic forecast, 13 of the 17 euro area 
66ECBAnnual Report
2013countries recorded government debt-to-GDP ratios above the Maastricht reference value of 60% 
in 2013; in eight of these countries, the general government debt ratio exceeded 90% of GDP. The 

rise in the aggregate euro area debt ratio is the result of the large impact of interest expenditure and 

stock-flow adjustment. As indicated in Table 4, according to the European Commission™s autumn 2013 economic forecast, 
for several countries, the budget balance is expected to have turned out worse than government 

plans outlined in countries™ April 2013 stability programmes or, in the case of Portugal, the 

economic adjustment programme target. Overall, the planned fiscal targets are projected to have 

been missed in all countries except for Germany, Estonia, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and 

Slovenia. Some countries, such as Italy and Slovakia, are expected to have missed their targets 

by a very small margin of 0.1%. Regarding the countries covered by EU-IMF financial assistance 

programmes, the fiscal deficit declined in Ireland and Portugal, while it rose in Greece and Cyprus. 

In the case of Greece, a primary surplus is expected to have been achieved in 2013, thereby 

exceeding the programme target. Box 6 reviews the 2013 developments in the euro area countries

1) For Greece and Portugal, figures refer not to the stability programme targets but to the review of the second adjustment programme. 

The targets for Greece have been set in primary balance terms.67ECBAnnual Report2013Box 6DEVELOPMENTS IN 2013 IN EURO AREA COUNTRIES UNDER AN EU-IMF ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMME OR RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCEThis box provides an overview of developments in 2013 in the four euro area countries under an EU-IMF adjustment programme, as well as in Spain, which has an EU financial sector assistance 

programme.1 All five countries made significant progress in reducing their economic imbalances, 
addressing structural rigidities, especially in labour markets, and improving financial stability. 

Moreover, Ireland and Spain successfully concluded their respective programmes. Looking 

ahead, it is necessary to consolidate the achievements that have already been made and to 

proceed with the reform agenda. Greece
In 2013 Greece made further progress in restoring fiscal sustainability and improving 
competitiveness. The economy started to stabilise in the second quarter of the year, following a 

deep and protracted recession. The far-reaching labour market reforms implemented in 2012 are 

beginning to show results, with encouraging data on net hiring in the private sector. While the 

decline in unit labour costs has been slow to translate into price adjustments, the process of price 

reductions gained momentum in 2013 and should also support continuous improvement in the 

country™s current account.As a result of the very strong consolidation efforts over the period 2010-13, a sizeable primary 
surplus (according to the programme definition) is expected to have been achieved in 2013. 

This outcome is better than the programme target of a balanced primary budget, mainly owing 

to underspending. In the period ahead, the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy provides for an 

increase in the primary surplus-to-GDP ratio, with targets of 1.5% in 2014, 3.0% in 2015 and 

4.5% in 2016. 
Notwithstanding the progress made in implementing structural reforms, the remaining deep-
rooted structural rigidities will need to be addressed more forcefully to create the basis for 

sustained economic growth and employment creation. Looking ahead, political commitment 

will be crucial for the necessary broadening and deepening of the structural reform agenda. In 

particular, product and services market reforms and institutional reforms need to be stepped up. 

The financial sector was strengthened by the capital increase in 2012-13. However, asset quality 

deteriorated further, with non-performing loans exceeding 30%. Ireland
The implementation of the adjustment programme for Ireland remained on track, enabling the 
authorities to conclude the programme successfully in December 2013. While the pace of growth 

of the Irish economy slowed somewhat in the first half of 2013, high-frequency indicators pointed 

towards a further strengthening in activity in the second half of the year. The labour market 
1 A longer-term perspective of the rebalancing process in the euro area since the start of the crisis is provided in Box 5 of the ECB™s 
Annual Report 2012. 68ECBAnnual Report
2013continued to show signs of strengthening. Competitiveness gains continued to be achieved and 
the current account improved further.In 2013 the fiscal position continued to improve and Ireland met its fiscal targets, despite the 
weak economy. The general government deficit is expected to have slightly outperformed 

the programme target in 2013. The 2014 budget foresees further consolidation, mainly on the 

expenditure side, aimed at reducing the general government deficit to 4.8% of GDP in 2014 

and to below 3.0% of GDP in 2015. Looking ahead, Ireland needs to address the remaining 

fiscal vulnerabilities, especially in healthcare spending, and to continue to comply with its fiscal 

targets in order to provide a positive signal to markets.Ireland™s exit from the programme underlines the success of the necessary, but sometimes painful, 
measures. It is crucial for Ireland to continue implementing the necessary reforms, particularly 

in the banking sector, in order to safeguard market access and its long-term economic prospects.Portugal
After a sharp contraction in 2011-12 real GDP and employment returned to positive growth rates 
in the second quarter of 2013. The correction of external imbalances has been remarkable in the 

past three years. The current account reached a surplus position in 2013.The pace of fiscal consolidation, as measured by the change in the structural deficit, was very 
strong throughout the period 2011-13. In mid-2013 the deficit path was adjusted to allow the 

partial operation of automatic stabilisers, while safeguarding the debt-to-GDP ratio over the 

medium term. The deficit targets (excluding financial sector support) were revised from 4.5% 

of GDP to 5.5% in 2013 and from 2.5% to 4% in 2014. In 2013 the deficit was below the target 

thanks to a better than expected macroeconomic performance combined with strict budgetary 

control. The 2014 budget includes consolidation measures of more than 2% of GDP, mainly on 

the expenditure side.Progress on structural reforms has been broadly in line with the programme conditionality. Most 
of the legislation on labour and product market policies included in the programme is now in 

force. Looking ahead, attention should focus on the effective implementation of the reforms, 

as well as on fostering the reform process, with the aim of removing the remaining obstacles to 

competition, investment decisions and job creation.Cyprus
The EU-IMF adjustment programme for Cyprus was approved in April 2013. The large 
accumulated imbalances, the delay in starting the adjustment programme and the banking crisis 

led to a severe contraction in economic activity, although the downturn in 2013 was less deep 

than initially expected. At the same time, unemployment increased sharply and lending came to 

a standstill. As a result of the deepening macroeconomic downturn, the fiscal position deteriorated in 2013. 
The programme set a primary deficit target of around 4¼% of GDP in 2013, including a one-

off cost of 1.8% of GDP to compensate provident funds and retirement funds held with the 

Cyprus Popular Bank in order to ensure comparable treatment to funds held with the Bank of 
69ECBAnnual Report2013Cyprus. Fiscal targets for 2013 were met by a considerable margin and in 2014 the primary 
deficit is
 expected to be lower than the original programme target of 4¼% of GDP. The 2014 

budget seeks to bring forward part of the consolidation needed in later years in order to achieve 

and maintain a long-term primary fiscal surplus of 4% of GDP, thereby putting public debt on a 

downward path.Good progress was made in 2013 in implementing structural and regulatory reforms. In addition, 
further progress was achieved in stabilising and restructuring the financial sector. In August
 2013 
the authorities published a roadmap, containing milestones, guiding the gradual relaxation of 

administrative measures and capital controls while safeguarding financial stability. Looking 

ahead, Cyprus will continue to face major challenges, particularly in the financial sector. It is 

therefore crucial that the programme continues to be implemented rigorously.Spain
On 14 November 2013 the Eurogroup confirmed the positive assessment of the implementation of 
the financial sector assistance programme for Spain. The programme has helped to significantly 

improve the funding situation and structure of the Spanish banking sector. After more than 

two years in recession, real GDP growth turned slightly positive in the third quarter of 2013. 

The unemployment rate remains at very high levels and only started to decline gradually in the 

second half of 2013. The Spanish economy is benefiting from ongoing downward adjustments in 

unit labour costs which have helped to shift the current account into surplus. Spain has recently achieved substantial fiscal consolidation and, with the help of additional 
consolidation measures passed in the autumn, is expected to have reached a deficit for 2013 

close to the target of 6.5%. Further efforts are needed to meet the 5.8% target for 2014. Looking ahead, it is crucial that the momentum of the reform process is maintained in the broader 
governance of the banking sector and in public administration and the labour markets.CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED INDICATORS 
As shown in Table 5, fiscal consolidation continued in 2013, even when accounting for the impact 

of the economic cycle on countries™ budgetary situations. According to the European Commission™s 

autumn 2013 economic forecast, both the cyclically adjusted balance and the cyclically adjusted 

primary balance (which excludes the effects of interest payments) are expected to have improved 

at the same pace as in 2012, i.e. by 1 and 0.9 percentage point of GDP respectively. The euro 

area structural deficit (which excludes one-off and temporary measures) further improved (by 

0.7 percentage point of GDP, after 1.5 percentage points in 2012). However, these cyclically 

adjusted fiscal indicators should be interpreted with caution, as real-time estimates of the cyclical 

impact on budget balances are subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, particularly in 

countries undergoing a significant rebalancing of their economies. Box 7 reviews progress with 

fiscal consolidation since the start of the crisis across the major advanced economies.70ECBAnnual Report

For Ireland, Spain, Austria, 

Portugal and Slovenia, changes in the cyclically adjusted and cyclically adjusted primary balances include the phasing-out of sizeable 

financial sector support measures. In the case of Greece, changes in the cyclically adjusted and cyclically adjusted primary balances 

include the bank recapitalisation costs, the transfers received from Member States corresponding to profits on Greek bonds held by the 

Eurosystem central banks and other small factors.Box 7PROGRESS WITH FISCAL CONSOLIDATION: AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONThis box reviews progress with fiscal consolidation since the start of the crisis across the 
major advanced economies, namely the euro area, the United States, the United Kingdom, 

Japan and Canada. All the major advanced economies, including individual euro area 

countries, have achieved significant progress in reducing fiscal imbalances since 2010. 

Nonetheless, both the headline deficit and debt ratios remain very high and above pre-crisis 

levels. Looking ahead, it is important that fiscal consolidation efforts are maintained to 

ensure a return to sound fiscal positions. 
Fiscal developments in the largest advanced economies since 2008
The international financial crisis of 2008, and the contraction in economic activity that followed, 
required swift and decisive policy action, especially in the major advanced economies which 

were particularly hit by the crisis. Since the end of 2008 emergency measures have been adopted 

in most major advanced economies, including in euro area countries, to provide financial support 

to banks in difficulty and preserve international financial stability. At the same time, and in 

order to limit the negative fall-out of the crisis for economic activity, governments have adopted 

significant budgetary stimuli. These policy actions, combined with the working of automatic 

stabilisers, caused the budget deficits and the debt-to-GDP ratios to rise to very high levels. 

Over the period 2008-10 nominal budget deficits increased by 5.5 percentage points of GDP 
 71ECBAnnual Report2013in the euro area, 6.4 percentage points in Canada, slightly above 7 percentage points in Japan 
and the United Kingdom, and about 8 percentage points in the United States (see Chart A). 
 Double-digit increases were recorded in the debt-to-GDP ratios, with Japan and the 
United Kingdom experiencing the largest increases (see Chart B).Since 2010 most advanced economies have embarked on fiscal consolidation. At that time, the 
IMF recommended an improvement in the cyclically adjusted balance of 1 percentage point of 

GDP per year, as of 2011, as being the appropriate pace of consolidation to strike the right 

balance between the need to address market concerns about fiscal fundamentals and the need 

to avoid an abrupt withdrawal of support to the then nascent recovery.1 The effective pace of 
consolidation, however, varied greatly across countries depending on the severity of financial 

market pressures, on the degree of fiscal imbalances and, specifically in the euro area, on the 

requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Compared with the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan, the budget deficit in the euro 
area at the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis was lower, whereas Canada recorded a surplus 

of 1.5% of GDP. Over the period 2011-13 the United States and the United Kingdom experienced 

the largest reduction in their budget deficit, followed by the euro area and Canada, whereas the 

deficit deteriorated slightly in Japan (see Chart C). According to IMF data, the annual average 

consolidation effort over the period 2011-13, as measured by the change in the cyclically 

adjusted balance, was above 1 percentage point of GDP in the euro area, the United
 States and 
the United Kingdom. It was about half that size in Canada and negative in Japan. 1 See ﬁFiscal exit: from strategy to implementationﬂ,

2013Consolidation efforts have started to bear fruit. Although nominal budget deficits in all the 
advanced economies remain high and above the pre-crisis levels, they have halved compared 

with their peak levels during the crisis in the United States and the euro area. In the euro area, the 

budget deficit and the cyclically adjusted balance in 2013 are expected to be the lowest among 

major advanced economies; the adjustment process has succeeded in bringing the cyclically 

adjusted deficit below its pre-crisis level in the euro area and the United Kingdom. Debt-to-GDP 

ratios, however, continued to trend upwards, following the rapid accumulation of sovereign 

liabilities in the aftermath of the crisis. The increase in the debt ratio was particularly pronounced 

in the United Kingdom, rising from 44% of GDP in 2007 to more than 90% of GDP in 2013, 

with Japan recording by far the highest (gross) government debt-to-GDP level, at 244% of GDP 

in 2013 (see Chart B). Developments within the euro area
Individual euro area countries were also severely hit by the financial and economic crisis of 
2008-09, and the 2010 sovereign debt crisis further added to the existing fiscal imbalances.As in the other major advanced economies, in most euro area countries the fiscal stance turned 
more restrictive in the course of 2010. The pace and timing of fiscal adjustment were set within 

the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact and the principles agreed at the October
 2009 ECOFIN Council;2 the latter were reflected in the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) 
recommendations of 2009. In response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, several countries 

stepped up significantly their consolidation efforts in an attempt to regain financial market 

confidence. This marked the beginning of a period of significant consolidation efforts, which 
2 In October 2009 the ECOFIN Council agreed on the principles for a coordinated exit from the fiscal stimulus adopted earlier. It was 
agreed that the specificities of country circumstances should be taken into account when defining the pace of adjustment, but that 
fiscal consolidation in all euro area countries should start by 2011 at the latest; countries with sustainability concerns had to start 
consolidating earlier. The planned pace of fiscal consolidation was recommended to be ambitious and well beyond the benchmark of 
0.5% of GDP per annum in structural terms in most Member States.Chart C Decomposition of the change in the budget balance over the periods 2008-10

those that experienced significant tensions in financial markets, turned out much larger than 

assumed at the time the 2009 EDP recommendations were issued.Although the consolidation efforts of the period 2010-13 succeeded in reversing the trend of 
rising budget deficits in most countries, deficit ratios remain above the pre-crisis values in many 
of them (see Chart D). Likewise, debt-to-GDP ratios remained well above the pre-crisis level and 

continued to increase, owing predominantly to a large positive differential between the interest 

rate on outstanding debt and the growth rate of the economy as well as the financial support 

granted to the banking sector.3The outlook for fiscal consolidation over the period 2014-16Looking ahead, the IMF October 2013 World Economic Outlook projects fiscal consolidation in 
the largest advanced economies, including euro area countries, to proceed in the next three years, 

although at a slightly slower pace than in the past. Japan is the exception, as it is expected to step 

up its fiscal adjustment, including an increase in the VAT rates in April 2014 and October 2015. 

The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to start declining in Canada in 2014 and in the euro area and 

the United States in 2015. It is projected to stabilise in Japan at a level of about 242% of GDP, 

whereas in the United Kingdom it is expected to remain on an upward trend. 3 For more details on progress with fiscal consolidation in euro area countries, see the box entitled ﬁFiscal consolidation in the euro area:

2013Consolidation needs remain large in several countries and the debt reduction process is subject 
to several challenges. The large debt stock in most advanced economies requires sustained 

fiscal efforts to place debt-to-GDP levels onto a downward trajectory, also taking into account 

unfavourable demographic trends which imply growing age-related spending (i.e. healthcare 

and pensions). Should countries fail to credibly announce and implement medium-term fiscal 

consolidation plans which tackle their fiscal imbalances at the root causes, sovereign bond yields 

might increase, thereby further impeding fiscal adjustment.IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACTAccording to the European Commission™s autumn 2013 economic forecast, all euro area countries 

except Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria, Slovakia and Finland are expected 

to have recorded a deficit above the 3% of GDP reference value in 2013. At the end of the year, 

13 euro area countries were subject to the excessive deficit procedure (EDP), with deadlines for 

reducing government deficit ratios below the reference value ranging from 2013 for Belgium to 
2016 for Spain, Cyprus and Greece. In June 2013 the ECOFIN Council abrogated the EDP for 

Italy and reopened it for Malta, with a deadline for correcting the excessive deficit by 2014. At 

the same time, and particularly in light of the worse than expected macroeconomic developments, 

the ECOFIN Council granted extensions to the EDP deadlines for a number of countries: one-year 

extensions for the Netherlands (to 2014) and Portugal (to 2015); two-year extensions for France 

and Slovenia (to 2015) and for Spain (to 2016); and a four-year extension for Cyprus (to 2016). 

Moreover, the ECOFIN Council recommended giving notice to Belgium to take measures to correct 

its excessive deficit by 2013, as it missed the 3% of GDP reference value by the 2012 EDP deadline 

and was deemed not to have taken effective action.FURTHER FISCAL CONSOLIDATION EXPECTED IN 2014 
In 2014 a continued gradual further improvement 
in the euro area budgetary position is expected. 
According to the European Commission™s 
autumn 2013 economic forecast, the general 

government deficit-to-GDP ratio for the euro 

area is projected to decline by 0.6
 percentage 
point to 2.5% of GDP (see
 Chart 27), i.e. below 
the Maastricht deficit reference value. The 

fiscal adjustment is projected to be entirely 

expenditure-based, with the expenditure ratio 

declining to 49.3% of GDP and the revenue 

ratio remaining broadly unchanged at 46.7% 

of GDP. Furthermore, the general government 

gross debt ratio is projected to increase only 

marginally and peak in 2014 at 95.9% of GDP.As regards fiscal developments at the country 
level in 2014, nine euro area countries are 

projected to record deficit ratios above the 3% 

of GDP reference value. At the same time, debt 

ratios are projected to exceed 100% of GDP in 

six countries, namely Belgium, Ireland, Greece, 

Italy, Cyprus and Portugal.Chart 27 Fiscal developments in the

notable progress towards restoring sound fiscal positions, which compares favourably with the 

progress made in other major advanced economies (see Box 7). Nevertheless, the euro area™s 

main fiscal policy challenge is still to sustain fiscal consolidation over the medium term, thereby 

reducing high government debt ratios. This is all the more important in view of the detrimental 

impact of ageing populations on public finances. Fiscal adjustment should proceed in line with 

the strengthened EU fiscal and economic governance framework and should be implemented in a 

growth-friendly manner that preserves efficient and growth-enhancing public investment. Countries 

should ensure that a safety
 margin is included in their budget plans to avoid missing the target if 
growth turns out to be slightly lower than expected.3 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
 IN NON-EURO AREA EU MEMBER STATESECONOMIC ACTIVITYReal GDP growth remained relatively sluggish in the majority of the 11 non-euro area EU Member 

States in 2013 (see Table 6).
7 Substantial headwinds remained, including economic weakness in 
the euro area, while deleveraging continued in most of these countries. External demand gradually 

recovered from the end-2012 slump in some countries, whereas imports declined in others owing to 

weak domestic absorption, with the result that the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth 

was mixed across non-euro area EU Member States. Domestic demand continued to drive GDP 

growth. Looking at the main components of domestic demand, public consumption increased in 

the majority of the non-euro area EU Member States. Growth in private consumption generally

2013remained subdued as households continued to repair their balance sheets and remained cautious 
given the uncertain global economic outlook. Aggregate investment increased in certain countries, 

but decreased in others. Alongside low growth, unemployment remained elevated in the majority 

of non-euro area EU Member States. Employment, however, increased in several countries 

and compensation per employee rose in all non-euro area EU Member States except Croatia. 

Nevertheless, the increase in unit labour costs was generally lower than that observed in 2012. 

Credit continued to grow weakly in many countries, reflecting a combination of tight supply-side 

conditions and low demand.Overall, while annual real GDP growth increased in 2013 in comparison with 2012 in weighted 
average terms, there were substantial cross-country differences. Among the non-euro area EU 

Member States, real GDP growth was highest in Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, whereas Croatia 

and the Czech Republic saw a contraction in output in 2013. Economic growth in Latvia and 

Lithuania remained dynamic in 2013 as domestic demand became a more prominent driver of 

growth. In Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania, domestic demand remained weak 

and net exports constituted the main source of growth. GDP growth in Romania was also supported 

by a good harvest. The economic recovery was slow in Denmark, as consumption was dampened 

by low growth in real disposable income and household debt consolidation. Croatia remained in 

recession for the fifth consecutive year as economic growth was held back by weak competitiveness 

and the bursting of the construction bubble. In Hungary, economic growth was attributable to 

changes in inventories as well as developments in domestic demand, construction and, in the latter 

part of 2013, manufacturing. After a speedy recovery from the crisis, Sweden™s economic growth 

moderated, reflecting weak investment and a deterioration in net exports. GDP growth recovered 

sharply in the United Kingdom in the course of 2013, driven mainly by household consumption, 
which benefited from a marked decrease in the household saving ratio as well as diminishing 

uncertainty about the economic outlook, both domestically and abroad. Finally, there were some 

signs of economic recovery in a number of non-euro area EU Member States towards the end of the 

year, supported by an accommodative monetary policy stance and improved prospects in the euro 

area combined with stronger household real disposable income and labour market dynamics.PRICE DEVELOPMENTSInflation slowed down in the majority of non-euro area EU Member States, with the weighted 

average annual inflation rate decreasing from 3.0% in 2012 to 1.9% in 2013 (see Table 7), reflecting 

reduced commodity price pressures and the fading-out of the effects of indirect tax hikes in the 

previous year. The weighted average HICP inflation excluding energy and unprocessed food in the 

non-euro area EU Member States also declined, from 2.5% in 2012 to 1.7% in 2013. The cross-

country variation in 12-month HICP inflation remained significant in 2013, with the highest annual 

inflation in 2013 being experienced by Romania (3.2%), while the inflation rate in Latvia fell to 

0.0%, the lowest among the non-euro area EU Member States. The decline in food and energy 

prices had a particularly pronounced effect on the aggregate HICP in countries such as Lithuania, 

Poland and Romania because of the relatively large share of their consumption basket accounted 

for by those commodities. Reductions in administered prices also contributed to lower inflation 

in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Lithuania. Indirect tax reductions in Denmark 

and Romania also had a dampening effect on inflation, while subdued domestic demand was an 

important factor driving the low rates of HICP inflation observed in Hungary. In Sweden, HICP 

inflation remained subdued, partially as a result of low import prices arising from the weak external 

environment and krona appreciation. While the United Kingdom has experienced elevated price 

pressures in recent years, inflation declined towards the end of 2013, partially reflecting subdued 

domestic cost pressures.77ECBAnnual Report2013FISCAL POLICIESThe budget balance-to-GDP ratios are projected to deteriorate in most non-euro area EU Member 
States in 2013; only the Czech Republic, Denmark, Lithuania and Romania expect an improvement 

(see Table 8). Deficits close to 5% of GDP or higher are projected for Croatia, Poland and the United 

Kingdom, while deficits at or close to the 3% of GDP reference value were projected by the European 

Commission™s autumn 2013 economic forecast for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Lithuania.Table 7 HICP inflation in the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area(annual percentage changes)20102011201220132013Q1 2013Q2 2013Q32013Q4 Bulgaria3.03.42.40.42.11.1-0.7-1.0Czech Republic1.22.13.51.41.71.51.21.1Denmark2.22.72.40.50.90.50.20.4Croatia1.12.23.42.34.22.32.20.6Latvia-1.24.22.30.00.4-0.10.0-0.2Lithuania1.24.13.21.22.21.40.50.5Hungary4.73.95.71.72.71.91.60.7Poland2.73.93.70.81.30.50.90.6Romania6.15.83.43.24.84.42.41.3Sweden1.91.40.90.40.60.30.70.3United Kingdom

2013At the end of 2013 the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom remained subject 
to an EU Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. For Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania 

and Romania, the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) was abrogated by the ECOFIN Council in 

June 2013. The deadlines set for correcting the excessive deficit situation remain unchanged at 2013 

for the Czech Republic and Denmark and at the financial year 2014/15 for the United Kingdom. 

The EDP deadline for Poland was extended by two years to 2014 by the ECOFIN Council in 

June 2013. In December 2013 the ECOFIN Council assessed Poland not to have taken effective 

action in response to the Council recommendation of 21 June 2013. Nevertheless, despite the lack 

of effective action, the ECOFIN Council in December 2013 issued a revised EDP recommendation, 

extending the EDP deadline by an additional year to 2015. The Council decided on 28 January 2014 

to open an EDP for Croatia given that neither the deficit nor the debt criterion had been met.The gross general government debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to have increased in all non-euro 
area EU Member States except Denmark and Lithuania in 2013. The debt-to-GDP ratio remained 

well above the 60% reference value in Hungary and the United Kingdom and just below this value 

in Croatia and Poland.BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTSIn 2013 the combined current and capital account balance (as a percentage of GDP) continued 

to improve in all non-euro area EU Member States except the United Kingdom (see Table 9). 
 As a result, surpluses were registered in all countries with the exception of the United Kingdom. 

The Czech Republic, Poland and Romania moved to surpluses for the first time since they joined 

the EU. In most non-euro area EU Member States in central and eastern Europe, the external 
adjustment was largely brought about by an improvement in the goods and services balances 

backed by robust export growth and, to a smaller extent, favourable developments in the income 

balance. Both Denmark™s and Sweden™s combined current and capital account surplus widened, 

notably reflecting developments in the income balance. The larger deficit of the United Kingdom 

meanwhile reflected a deterioration of the services and income balances.Table 9 Balance of payments of the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area(as a percentage of GDP)Current and capital account balanceNet direct investment flowsNet other investment flows2010201120122013 1)2010201120122013 1)2010201120122013 1)Bulgaria -0.71.40.13.22.73.13.01.9-2.7-4.44.60.7Czech Republic-3.0-2.3-1.10.92.51.24.72.3-1.80.3-2.9-1.8Denmark5.96.36.06.6-3.60.2-1.6-0.84.2-2.9-1.1-7.0Croatia-0.8-0.80.11.30.92.32.61.51.70.3-5.5-3.4Latvia4.90.00.51.51.54.93.21.8-0.8-7.2-5.1-4.7Lithuania2.7-1.22.03.52.23.20.71.4-9.2-1.5-5.1-2.4Hungary 2.02.83.65.60.80.92.10.10.6-3.7-12.7-12.1Poland-3.3-3.0-1.50.41.42.41.10.72.10.5-1.20.5Romania-4.2-3.9-3.00.81.81.41.71.34.71.7-3.0-5.8Sweden6.25.95.96.1-4.4-3.2-2.4-4.6-8.8-9.8-3.4-4.7United Kingdom-3.0-1.1-3.5-3.80.9-2.3-0.62.40.06.215.52.9EU8 2)-2.2-2.0-0.81.41.72.02.11.10.9-0.3-3.2-2.6EU11 3)-1.10.0-1.0-0.50.2-1.0-0.21.0-0.41.97.3-0.2Euro area0.10.21.42.2-0.9-0.90.0-1.4-0.2-1.8-2.1-3.1Source: ECB.1) Figures for 2013 refer to the four-quarter average up to the third quarter of 2013.

States represented on aggregate about 1% of GDP in 2013. Denmark and Sweden remained net 

exporters of foreign direct investment, whereas the United Kingdom turned from being a net 
exporter of foreign direct investment flows into a net recipient. Even though non-euro area EU 

Member States in central and eastern Europe remained net importers of foreign direct investment, 

net inflows slowed down in comparison to 2012, notably in the Czech Republic and Hungary. The 

United Kingdom continued to record portfolio investment outflows, in contrast to the considerable 

inflows observed for Latvia and Romania. Regarding other investment flows, all non-euro area EU 

Member States except Bulgaria, Poland and the United Kingdom experienced net outflows in
 2013, 
reflecting to some degree the ongoing process of deleveraging.EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTSExchange rate developments in the currencies of non-euro area EU Member States reflected 

the different exchange rate regimes that were in place in individual countries. The currencies of 

Denmark, Latvia and Lithuania participated in the exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II). The 

Latvian lats and the Lithuanian litas were subject to a standard fluctuation band of ±15% around 

their central rates against the euro, and the Danish krone was subject to a narrower band of ±2.25% 

(see Chart 28). ERM II participation was, in the case of the Baltic States, accompanied by unilateral 

commitments to maintain a narrower fluctuation 

band (Latvia) or a currency board regime 

(Lithuania). These unilateral commitments 

place no additional obligations on the ECB. 

The Lithuanian litas joined ERM II with its 

existing currency board arrangement in place, 

and the Latvian authorities decided to maintain 

the exchange rate of the lats at its central rate 

against the euro with a fluctuation band of ±1%. 

During 2013 the Lithuanian litas remained at 

its central rate, while the Latvian lats fluctuated 

within the unilaterally set band of ±1% vis-à-

vis the euro. On 9 July 2013 the EU Council 

adopted a decision allowing Latvia to adopt the 

euro as its currency from 1 January 2014. The 
conversion rate was set at LVL 0.702804 to 
the euro, which was also the central rate of the 

Latvian lats throughout Latvia™s membership of 

ERM II (see also Chapter 3).Turning to the currencies of non-euro area 
EU Member States that did not participate in 

ERM II in 2013, a general weakening against 
the euro over the course of the year was 
observed (see Chart 29). This reflected the 

broad-based strengthening of the euro vis-à-
vis major currencies that began in the second 
half of 2012, when euro area financial market

2013sentiment improved and risk aversion declined. 
The relative stabilisation of the economic 

situation in the euro area also translated into 

lower volatility of the bilateral exchange rates of 

currencies of non-euro area EU Member States 

against the euro. As a result, in early January 
2014 all these currencies, with the exception 

of the Bulgarian lev, which is in a currency 

board, traded below the levels at the beginning 

of 2013. The largest decline was observed for 
the Czech koruna, which weakened by about 

8½% over this period. A large part of this 

downward movement resulted from foreign 



in November 2013. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSThe normalisation of financial markets in non-

euro area EU Member States, which started 
in the second half of 2012, continued overall. 
During the first months of 2013 financial 
conditions mostly improved in the context 
of improved risk appetite stemming from the 

progress made in 2012 towards resolving 
the euro area sovereign debt crisis and continued accommodative monetary policy in the major 

economic areas. Financial conditions deteriorated sharply for all countries in the late spring of 2013, 

after the US Federal Reserve indicated that it could soon begin tapering its monthly bond purchases 

under its quantitative easing programme. Financial market sentiment remained very sensitive to 

signals from the Federal Reserve, but on average improved from the late summer of 2013 as market 
participants™ fears about an impending tapering of bond purchases receded. Financial market 

reactions were generally muted when the Federal Reserve eventually announced in December that 

it would taper its bond purchase programme beginning in January 2014.In the course of 2013 long-term interest rates, as measured by ten-year government bond yields, increased for most countries, with the notable exceptions of Hungary, Lithuania and Romania. 

Long-term interest rates in Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom increased the most, as they 

followed closely the rise in global low-risk interest rates. By contrast, money market interest rates 

declined in most non-euro area EU Member States. Developments in credit risk premia, as measured 

by credit default swaps (CDSs), were stable compared with those over the last few years. In late 

2013 sovereign CDS premia stood close to their lowest level since the outbreak of the financial 

crisis in 2008, with Croatia and Hungary being the exceptions. Stock market developments varied 

markedly among the non-euro area EU Member States, but on average stock prices rose by 15% in 

2013, compared with the 20% increase observed for the euro area. Equity prices increased the most 

in Bulgaria (by 42%) and only decreased in the Czech Republic (by 5%).MONETARY POLICYThe primary objective of monetary policy in all non-euro area EU Member States is price stability. 

Monetary policy strategies, however, continued to differ considerably from country to country 
 in 2013 (see Table 10). Chart 29 Developments in non-ERM II EU

1) Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013.81ECBAnnual Report2013Limited inflationary pressure arising from subdued economic growth and declining commodity 
prices set the environment for the measures taken by several central banks of the non-euro area EU 

Member States. Since the end of December 2012 five NCBs have cut their key policy interest rates. 

The key policy rates were reduced in Hungary (in 14 steps for a total of 3.05 percentage points), 

Poland (6 steps totalling 1.75 percentage points), Romania (6 steps totalling 1.75 percentage points), 

Latvia (3 steps totalling 2.25 percentage points) and Sweden (1 step of 0.25 percentage point). In all 

countries, the decisions were driven by weak cyclical positions, as well as an outlook characterised 

by negative output gaps and subdued inflationary pressures. As a consequence, the monetary policy 

stance in these economies remained very accommodative. Danmarks Nationalbank first raised its 

repo rate by 0.1 percentage point in January 2013 (following foreign exchange sales in the market) 

and then cut the rate by a similar amount in May (following the ECB™s policy rate cut).A number of central banks of non-euro area EU Member States introduced new unconventional monetary policy measures to combat economic weakness. In Hungary, the Magyar Nemzeti 

Bank announced a funding programme (Funding for Growth Scheme) in April 2013, targeting 

an improvement in the financing conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and a 

reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England and the 

Treasury announced an extension of the Funding for Lending Scheme in April 2013. Specifically, 

the scheme will be extended for one year (until the end of January 2015), and strong incentives Table 10 Official monetary policy strategies of the non-euro area EU Member StatesMonetary policy strategyCurrencyFeaturesBulgariaExchange rate targetBulgarian levExchange rate target: fixed to the euro at BGN 1.95583 per euro within the framework of a currency board arrangement.

banka started intervening in the foreign exchange market to weaken the koruna against the euro, 



banka decided to maintain an exchange rate of the koruna against the euro close to CZK 27. Two 

non-euro area EU Member State NCBs introduced forward guidance for future monetary policy 

rates in 2013. In Poland, Narodowy Bank Polski introduced forward guidance in July by declaring 

that, given low inflation pressures and a moderate expected economic recovery, policy rates should 

be kept at the current low levels at least until the end of 2013. In November this period was extended 

until the end of the first half of 2014. The Bank of England announced in August its intention not 

to raise the main policy rate until a number of conditions are met. Initially the forward guidance 

programme emphasised that the main policy rate would not be raised until the official measure 

of the unemployment rate had fallen to a threshold of 7%. As unemployment fell more rapidly 

than had been anticipated, the policy criteria were subsequently revised such that the decision on 

whether to raise the main policy rate will be based on a broader set of conditions, specifically: 
 (i) the extent to which the recovery is entrenched and broadly based; (ii) the extent to which supply 



banka indicated on a number of occasions in 2013 its intention to leave policy rates unchanged over 

a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly.The installation of the facades for the double office tower continued throughout 2013. A combination of different geometries makes the high-rise look like a large crystal, with oblique panels on the western and 
eastern facades and hyperbolic paraboloid surfaces on the northern and southern facades. A hyperbolic paraboloid surface 
can be constructed from rectilinear elements. On this basis, the facades of each tower consist of flat glass panels, 90% of 
which are identical. The glass panels run the entire height of each storey, which means only the vertical fixings are visible. 

The result is a homogeneous curved glass surface made up of straight panels.85ECBAnnual Report2013CHAPTER 2CENTRAL BANK OPERATIONS

ONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENTS, FOREIGN

ACTIVITIES1.1 M
ONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENTSThe monetary policy instruments used by the Eurosystem in 2013 comprised open market operations, 
such as main refinancing operations (MROs), longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) 

and fine-tuning operations, as well as standing facilities and minimum reserve requirements. 
 In addition, counterparties were given for the first time the option to repay on a weekly basis 

amounts outstanding from the three-year LTROs allotted in December 2011 and February 2012. During 2013 the Governing Council changed key ECB interest rates on two occasions (see Chart
 30). On 8 May 2013 the width of the interest rate corridor around the rate on the MROs decreased from 

150 basis points to 100 basis points, as the interest rates on the MROs and the marginal lending 

facility were reduced by 25 and 50 basis points to 0.50% and 1.00% respectively, while the rate on 

the deposit facility remained unchanged at 0.00%. In addition, on 13 November
 2013 the interest 
rate corridor narrowed further to 75 basis points 

and became asymmetric, as the interest rates 

on the MROs and the marginal lending facility 

were reduced by 25 basis points each to 0.25% 
and 0.75% respectively, while the rate on the 

deposit facility remained unchanged at 0.00%.Banks™ early repayment since January 2013 of 
amounts outstanding from the two three-year 

LTROs resulted in a decline in excess liquidity
1. These early repayments by counterparties 

(of more than •440 billion since early 2013) 

reflected a shift in the banking system™s demand 

for liquidity buffers (see Chart 31), which by 

the end of 2013 had returned to levels last seen 

in autumn 2011, before the allotment of the 

first three-year LTRO. An easing of financial 

market tensions and improved market funding 

conditions also contributed to reduced recourse 

by the euro area banking system to central bank 
liquidity, despite the full allotment and fixed 

rate tender procedures used in all liquidity-
providing refinancing operations.21 Excess liquidity can be defined as the sum of net usage of the deposit facility (deposit facility minus marginal lending facility) plus the 
daily reserve surplus (current accounts minus reserve requirements).2 The rates in the three-month LTROs were fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the lifetime of the LTROs.

The marked increase in 
liquidity needs was the result of a decrease in net foreign assets accompanied by an increase in 

other autonomous factors owing partly to the reduction of emergency liquidity assistance provided 

in the euro area (see Chart 32). Minimum reserve requirements decreased from •106 billion on 

average during the 12 maintenance periods of 2012 to •104.5 billion during the 12 maintenance 

periods of 2013.The average daily amount of excess reserves (current account holdings in excess of reserve 
requirements) in the period under review stood at •196.8 billion, broadly unchanged from their 

2012 average level (•216.5 billion). This rather large amount of excess reserves is mainly the 

outcome of the deposit rate standing at zero for the whole of 2013, which made banks indifferent as 

to whether they used the deposit facility overnight or left excess reserves on their current accounts 

(see Chart 32). Excess reserves declined gradually throughout the year, however, largely because 

banks reduced their recourse to Eurosystem operations and repaid early (i.e. before the scheduled 
maturity) part of the three-year LTROs as market functioning gradually normalised. Excess reserves 

thus declined from approximately •361 billion in the first maintenance period of the year to •144.8 

billion in the last maintenance period. The average daily use of the deposit facility also declined in 

the course of the year: it stood at around •184 billion in the first maintenance period and steadily 

decreased to •60 billion in the last maintenance period.OPEN MARKET OPERATIONSIn 2013 the Eurosystem used MROs, regular three-month LTROs, special-term refinancing 

operations with a maturity of one maintenance period and fine-tuning operations to manage the 

liquidity situation in the money market. All liquidity-providing credit operations have to be fully 

collateralised. The fine-tuning operations were used to absorb the liquidity injected through the 

Securities Markets Programme (SMP) as announced by the Governing Council on 10
 May 2010.  In addition, counterparties were given the option to repay outstanding amounts borrowed in the 

three-year LTROs via weekly procedures, although these did not, strictly speaking, constitute 

tender operations.MROs are regular operations with a weekly frequency which normally have a maturity of one 
week. They are the main instrument for signalling the ECB™s monetary policy stance. In 2013 all 53 

MROs were conducted as fixed rate tender procedures in which all bids were satisfied. However, 

given the declining, yet still abundant excess liquidity from the three-year LTROs, the relative 

importance of MROs in terms of outstanding liquidity remained low. The number of counterparties 

which are eligible to participate in open market operations decreased from 2,298 at the end of 2012 

to 1,740 at the end of 2013, while the number of euro area MFIs declined from 7,059 at the end of 

2012 to 6,790 at the end of 2013. On average, 76 counterparties participated in the MROs conducted 

in 2013. The average volume allotted in the MROs in 2013 was •108 billion, compared with •98 

billion in 2012. MRO allotment volumes in 2013 ranged between •77.7 billion (on 9 January) and 

•168.7 billion (on 30 December), while the number of bidders fluctuated between 62 (on 22 May) 

and 181 (on 30 December).In the twelve maintenance periods of 2013 the daily average outstanding volume of liquidity 
allotted in the regular three-month LTROs and the special-term refinancing operations with a 

maturity of one maintenance period was •12.5 billion. Participation in the regular three-month 
88ECBAnnual Report
2013LTROs averaged •7.2 billion and ranged from a minimum of •1.9 billion allotted in October to a 
maximum of •20.9 billion allotted in December. The average number of participating counterparties 

was 46. The average volume allotted in the one-month special-term refinancing operations was 

•5.3 billion and the average number of participating counterparties was 21. In the same period the 

daily average outstanding volume of liquidity allotted via the three-year LTROs was •694.8 billion. 

The outstanding amount of the two three-year LTROs dropped from •992 billion at the beginning 

of 2013 to •544.4 billion by the end of the year, down by almost •440 billion, as counterparties 

gradually repaid part of their outstanding amounts. In addition to the open market operations used for the implementation of monetary policy, the ECB 
can also provide eligible counterparties with liquidity in other currencies (see Section 1.2 of this 

chapter).SECURITIES MARKETS PROGRAMMEThe Governing Council decided in May 2010 to establish the SMP. The objective of this temporary 

programme was to address the malfunctioning of certain euro area debt securities market segments 

and to restore an appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism. With the announcement 

of the technical features of the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) on 6
 September 2012, 
the SMP was terminated. As in the past, the liquidity injected through the SMP continued to 

be absorbed on a weekly basis in 2013. The securities bought under the SMP will in principle 

be held to maturity. However, Eurosystem accounting rules allow sales of held-to-maturity 

securities when the remaining time to maturity is less than one month. The Eurosystem therefore 

participated in the public buy-back offer initiated by the Irish National Treasury Management 

Agency on 17
 December 2013 and sold all of its SMP holdings of the Irish security maturing on 
 15 January 2014 at the offer price. At the programme™s peak, the Eurosystem held SMP securities 
for a total settlement amount of •219.5 billion. By the end of 2013 the Eurosystem™s holdings of 

SMP securities had been reduced to •178.8 billion owing to redemptions and participation in the 

Irish buy-back operation. In February 2013 the Governing Council decided to publish details of the 

Eurosystem™s holdings of securities acquired under the SMP. This decision was taken in line with 

the transparency envisaged for the OMTs.4THE FIRST AND SECOND COVERED BOND PURCHASE PROGRAMMESAs part of its non-standard monetary operations, the ECB conducted two covered bond purchase 

programmes in 2009-10 (CBPP) and 2011-12 (CBPP2). These programmes were launched with the 

purpose of easing funding conditions for banks and companies and encouraging banks to maintain 

or expand lending to their customers. While it is intended that the bonds purchased under both 

programmes will be held until maturity, the Governing Council decided to make the portfolios 
of the programmes available for securities lending. Lending is voluntary and conducted through 

securities lending facilities offered by central securities depositories, or via matched repurchase 

transactions with eligible counterparties. This lending activity remained limited in terms of 

amounts in 2013. Nevertheless, it is considered useful from a market functioning perspective that 

the securities held under the programmes are, in principle, available for lending. By the end of 2013 

the Eurosystem™s holdings of covered bonds amounted to •41.6 billion under the first programme 

and •15.4 billion under the second programme, compared with •60 billion and •16.4 billion at the 

end of the respective programmes.4 More information on the SMP can be found in the ECB™s press release of 10 May 2010, the ECB™s Decision of 14 May 2010 establishing 
a securities markets programme, the ECB™s press release of 21 February 2013 and the weekly financial statements of the Eurosystem.89ECBAnnual Report2013OUTRIGHT MONETARY TRANSACTIONSIn August 2012 the Governing Council announced the setting-up of the OMTs, the technical features 
of which were further specified in September 2012.
5 These OMTs aim to safeguard an appropriate 
monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy in the euro area. A necessary condition for OMTs is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate 
European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. 

This conditionality aims to ensure that governments will make the appropriate structural reforms 

and maintain fiscal discipline. The Governing Council will consider OMTs to the extent that 

they are warranted from a monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality is 

fully respected, and terminate them once their objectives have been achieved or when there is 
 non-compliance with the macroeconomic adjustment or precautionary programme. OMTs will 

be considered for future cases of ESM macroeconomic adjustment programmes or precautionary 

programmes (such as an enhanced conditions credit line). They may also be considered for Member 

States already under a macroeconomic adjustment programme as they regain bond market access. 

OMTs would not take place while a given programme is under review and would resume after the 

review period once programme compliance has been assured.Transactions would be focused on the shorter part of the yield curve, and in particular on sovereign 
bonds with a residual maturity of between one and three years. No ex ante quantitative limits are 

set on the size of OMTs. The Eurosystem intends to accept the same (pari passu) treatment as 

private or other creditors with respect to bonds issued by euro area countries and purchased by 

the Eurosystem through OMTs. The liquidity created through the OMTs would be fully sterilised, 

as has been the case for the SMP. At the same time, the transparency regarding the composition 

of the OMT portfolio would be greater than that of the SMP portfolio, reflecting the operational 

differences between the OMTs and the SMP. The OMTs had not been activated by the end of 2013.
FINE-TUNING OPERATIONSIn order to absorb the liquidity injected through the SMP, the ECB conducted weekly fine-tuning 

operations to collect one-week fixed-term deposits corresponding to the outstanding size of the 

SMP as recorded in the weekly financial statement published during the same week. These fine-

tuning operations were carried out as variable rate tender procedures with a maximum bid rate 

equal to the prevailing MRO rate.STANDING FACILITIESCounterparties can use the two standing facilities on their own initiative to obtain overnight liquidity 

against eligible collateral or to place overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. At the end of 2013 

1,983 counterparties had access to the marginal lending facility and 2,460 counterparties had access 

to the deposit facility. The use of the deposit facility stood at significant levels during the first half 

of 2013, with a peak of •211.8 billion on 28 January. Owing to the reduction of excess liquidity 

as a result of early repayment of the three-year LTROs, the average recourse to the deposit facility 

decreased from •125.3 billion during the first six maintenance periods of 2013 to •63.6 billion 

during the last six maintenance periods, as banks left larger amounts on their current accounts. The 

average daily use of the deposit facility over the 12 maintenance periods of 2013 was •93.2 billion 
 (compared with •484.3 billion for the 12 maintenance periods of 2012 and •120 billion for the 

12 maintenance periods of 2011). In 2013 the use of the deposit facility followed a broadly 

similar pattern during each reserve maintenance period: the deposit facility amounts were lower 

at the beginning of each period, but increased subsequently as more counterparties fulfilled their 
5 See the ECB™s press release of 6 September 2012.
90ECBAnnual Report
2013reserve requirements. The average daily recourse to the marginal lending facility was •0.47 billion 
(compared with •1.76 billion in 2012 and •2.1 billion in 2011).MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEMCredit institutions in the euro area are required to hold minimum reserves on current accounts 

with the Eurosystem. From 1999 to 2011 the minimum reserve requirements were equal to 2% of 

credit institutions™ reserve base liabilities of up to two years™ maturity. On 8
 December 2011 the 
Governing Council decided, as an additional enhanced credit support measure, to reduce the reserve 

ratio from 2% to 1%, as from the reserve maintenance period starting on 18
 January 2012. The 
minimum reserve requirements amounted to •104.7 billion on average during the 12 maintenance 

periods of 2013 (compared with •106 billion in 2012). As the Eurosystem remunerates reserve 

holdings at a rate corresponding to the MRO rate, the minimum reserve system does not impose a 

tax on the banking sector.ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR CREDIT OPERATIONSAs stipulated in Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, all credit operations of the Eurosystem are 

based on adequate collateral. This is standard central bank practice worldwide. Collateral adequacy 

implies that the Eurosystem is to a large extent protected from losses in its credit operations 

(see below for more details on risk management issues). Furthermore, the Eurosystem ensures that 

sufficient collateral is available to a wide set of counterparties, so that the Eurosystem can provide 

the amount of liquidity it deems necessary in its monetary policy operations.The Eurosystem accepts a broad range of assets as collateral in all its credit operations. This 
feature of the Eurosystem™s collateral framework, together with the fact that access to Eurosystem 

open market operations is granted to a large pool of counterparties, has been key in supporting 

the implementation of monetary policy in times of stress. The inbuilt flexibility of its operational 

framework has allowed the Eurosystem to provide the necessary liquidity to address the impaired 

functioning of the money market during the financial crisis, without counterparties encountering 

widespread collateral constraints. In 2013 the Eurosystem adopted several measures related to 

its collateral eligibility criteria. On 20
 March 2013 a decision was adopted which prevents, as of 
1 March 2015, the use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations of uncovered government-

guaranteed bank bonds that have been issued by the counterparty itself or an entity closely linked 

to that counterparty. In addition, on 2
 May 2013 it was announced that marketable debt instruments 

issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus which do not meet the Eurosystem™s 

requirements for credit quality thresholds but do fulfil all other eligibility criteria would again 

constitute eligible collateral for the purposes of Eurosystem credit operations, subject to special 

haircuts. Moreover, the ECB loosened its eligibility criteria and reduced its haircuts for asset-

backed securities (ABSs) which comply with loan-level reporting requirements. Additional 

information regarding the ABS loan-level data and changes to the Eurosystem™s collateral risk 

control framework is provided in the section below on risk management issues. In 2013 the average amount of marketable assets eligible as collateral was •14.2 trillion, a 3% 
increase compared with 2012 (see Chart 33). This development was related in particular to an 

increase in the eligibility of corporate bonds and other marketable assets. Central government 

securities, which amounted to •6.4 trillion, accounted for 45% of total eligible collateral, followed 

by uncovered bank bonds (•2.3 trillion, or 16%) and covered bank bonds (•1.6 trillion, or 11%), 

and corporate bonds (•1.5 trillion, or 11%). As well as marketable collateral, eligible collateral 

includes non-marketable assets, mostly in the form of credit claims (also referred to as bank loans). 

In contrast to the situation for marketable assets, the volume of potentially eligible non-marketable 
91ECBAnnual Report2013assets cannot easily be measured. The deposited 
amount of non-marketable assets remained 

almost unchanged at •0.6 trillion in 2013.The average amount of collateral put forward 
by counterparties decreased slightly to 
 •2,347 billion in 2013, from •2,448 billion 

in 2012 (see Chart 34). At the same time, the 

average amount of outstanding credit decreased 

from •1,131 billion in 2012 to •830 billion in 
2013. Consequently, both the share and the 

absolute amount of deposited collateral not 

used to cover credit operations increased during 

2013. The level of over-collateralisation shows 

that, at the aggregate level, the Eurosystem™s 
counterparties experienced no shortage of 

collateral.As regards the composition of collateral put 
forward (see Chart 35), non-marketable assets 

(mostly credit claims and fixed-term deposits) 

were the largest component in 2013, accounting 

for 25% of the total (the same share as in 2012). 

The share of covered bank bonds also remained Chart 33 Eligible marketable assets

counterparties fulfilling certain eligibility criteria defined in the ﬁGeneral Documentationﬂ
6. Although the eligibility criteria require such counterparties to be financially sound, the Eurosystem 

may still be exposed to the risk of unexpected counterparty defaults. This risk is mitigated by 

requiring counterparties to submit adequate collateral. However, in the event of a counterparty 

default, the Eurosystem would also be exposed to credit, market and liquidity risks associated with 

the resolution of collateral assets. In addition, liquidity-providing operations in foreign currencies 

against euro-denominated collateral, as well as euro-denominated liquidity-providing operations 

against foreign collateral, entail currency risk. In order to reduce all these risks to acceptable levels, 

the Eurosystem maintains high credit standards for assets accepted as collateral, values collateral on 

a daily basis and applies appropriate risk control measures such as valuation haircuts.As a matter of prudence, the Eurosystem has established a buffer against potential shortfalls 
resulting from the eventual resolution of collateral received from defaulted counterparties. The 

level of the buffer is reviewed annually, pending the possible disposal of the received collateral 
and in line with the prospect of recovery. More generally, financial risks in credit operations are 

continuously monitored and quantified at the Eurosystem level and regularly reported to the ECB™s 

decision-making bodies.In the course of 2013 the Eurosystem adopted several measures that further enhanced its eligibility 
criteria and risk control framework. As of 3
 January 2013 loan-level data had to be reported for 
residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) and ABSs backed by loans to small and medium-

sized enterprises (SME ABSs) in order for them to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem 

credit operations. The reporting requirements for commercial mortgage-backed securities 

(CMBSs) became applicable on 1
 March 2013. These loan-level data, which are also available 
to all market participants and investors, should allow for a more informed credit risk analysis of 

structured finance transactions. The smooth transition to full compliance with the loan-level data 

requirements for RMBSs and SME ABSs was facilitated by the decision of the Governing Council, 

announced on 9
 September 2013, to require originators to provide explanations for any missing 
data (in
 accordance with pre-specified tolerance thresholds) and an action plan for reaching full 

compliance with reporting requirements. In September 2013 the Governing Council also decided 

to implement a loan-level template for ABSs backed by credit card receivables, mandatory as of 

1 April 2014. The use of the templates for the other asset classes (i.e. auto loans, consumer finance 

loans and leasing receivables) became mandatory on 1 January 2014.In July 2013 the Governing Council decided to further strengthen its risk control framework, in 
the context of a regular review conducted with the aim of maintaining adequate risk protection and 

enhancing risk equivalence across the various asset classes that are used as collateral in Eurosystem 

monetary policy operations. This was done by adjusting the Eurosystem collateral eligibility rules 

and haircuts, for both marketable and non-marketable instruments. The introduced changes related 

in particular to the treatment of retained covered bonds and of ABSs. A new valuation markdown 

for retained covered bonds (covered bonds that are pledged as collateral by the issuer or by closely 

related entities) was introduced. The markdown of the collateral value was set at 8% for retained 
6 ﬁThe implementation of monetary policy in the euro area Œ General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and 
proceduresﬂ, available on the ECB™s website.93ECBAnnual Report2013covered bonds in credit quality steps 1 and 2 and 12% for those in credit quality step 3. The ECB also revised the eligibility criteria for ABSs primarily to reflect their increased transparency and 

standardisation as a result of the loan-level reporting requirement, and to bring their treatment closer 

to the eligibility criteria for other types of asset. In particular, the ECB replaced the requirement 

of two triple-A ratings for ABSs subject to loan-level reporting requirements with a requirement 

of at least two single-A ratings. Furthermore, the haircuts applicable to ABSs eligible under both 

the general and the temporary collateral framework were reduced. The new eligibility criteria and 

haircut schedule resulting from the review of the Eurosystem risk control framework entered into 

force on 1
 October 2013 (except for the valuation markdowns for own-use covered bonds, which 

were applied from 1 November 2013). In addition, the Eurosystem introduced a methodology for 

determining the minimum haircuts applied by NCBs to pools of credit claims and certain types of 

additional credit claim eligible under the temporary Eurosystem collateral framework, applicable as 

of January 2014.With regard to the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF), on 6
 September 2013 the Governing Council decided to readmit the rating tool of Cerved Group to the ECAF. This followed 
Cerved™s completion of the amendments necessary to comply with the Basel II definition of default. 

Additionally, on 28
 June and 14 November 2013 the Governing Council approved the in-house 
credit assessment system of, respectively, the Banca d™Italia and the Nationale Bank van België/

Banque Nationale de Belgique for use within the ECAF.1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKSIn 2013 the Eurosystem did not intervene in the foreign exchange markets. Furthermore, the ECB 

did not undertake any foreign exchange operations in the currencies that participate in ERM II. The 

standing agreement between the ECB and the IMF to facilitate the initiation of special drawing right 

(SDR) transactions by the IMF on behalf of the ECB with other SDR holders was not activated in 

2013. The last time that it was activated was in 2011.The temporary liquidity swap line which the ECB established with the Federal Reserve System 
in 2007, which was reactivated in May 2010 to counter strains in the European US dollar funding 

markets, was extended on 13
 December 2012 until 1
 February 2014. In close cooperation with 
other central banks, the Eurosystem provided US dollar funding to counterparties against eligible 

collateral in operations which took the form of repurchase agreements and were carried out as 

fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. In addition to these regular weekly seven-day 

operations, the ECB, in coordination with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of 

England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, continued to conduct every four weeks 

US dollar liquidity-providing operations with a maturity of 84 days. In 2013, from a value-date 

perspective, the Eurosystem conducted 50 operations with a seven-day maturity, as well as one 

15-day operation at the year-end and thirteen 84-day operations. The temporary bilateral swap 

arrangements established in 2011 between the ECB, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the 

Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank to enhance their capacity to provide liquidity support 

to the global financial system and to ease strains in financial markets were not used in 2013. They 

are seen, however, as effective in easing financial strains and mitigating their effects on economic 

conditions. These swap arrangements were extended on 13
 December 2012 until 1
 February 2014. On 31
 October 2013 the ECB announced, in cooperation with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of 
England, the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank, the conversion of 
94ECBAnnual Report
2013their temporary bilateral swap arrangements to standing arrangements that will remain in place until 
further notice. These arrangements allow for the provision of liquidity in each jurisdiction in any of 

the five currencies foreign to that jurisdiction, should the two central banks in a particular bilateral 

swap arrangement judge that market conditions warrant such action in one of their currencies. The 

standing arrangements will continue to serve as a prudent liquidity backstop. They will enable the 

Eurosystem to continue to provide euro to those central banks when required and to provide to its 
counterparties, when necessary, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars 

in addition to the existing liquidity-providing operations in US dollars.On 16 September
 2013 the Governing Council decided, in agreement with the Bank of England, to extend the liquidity swap arrangement with the Bank of England until 30
 September 2014. The 
swap facility agreement of 17
 December 2010 had been authorised until 30 September 2013. Under 
this facility, the Bank of England can provide, if necessary, up to GBP 10 billion to the ECB in 

exchange for euro. The agreement allows pounds sterling to be made available to the Central Bank 

of Ireland as a precautionary measure, for the purpose of meeting any temporary liquidity needs of 

the banking system in that currency.On 10 October 2013 the ECB announced the establishment of a bilateral currency swap agreement 
with the People™s Bank of China. The swap line has a maximum size of •45 billion or CNY 350 

billion. From the perspective of the Eurosystem, the swap line will serve as a backstop liquidity 

facility and to reassure euro area banks of the continuous provision of Chinese renminbi. The swap 

line should be seen in the context of rapidly growing bilateral trade and investment between the 

euro area and China, as well as the need to ensure the stability of financial markets.1.3 I
NVESTMENT ACTIVITIESThe ECB invests the funds related to its foreign reserve portfolio as well as its own funds. These 

investment activities, which are separate from monetary policy programmes such as the OMTs, the 

SMP, the CBPP and the CBPP2, are organised in such a way as to ensure that no inside information 

about central bank policy actions may be used when making investment decisions.FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio was originally set up through transfers of foreign reserve assets 

from the euro area NCBs. Over time, the composition of the portfolio reflects changes in the market 

value of the invested assets, as well as foreign exchange and gold operations of the ECB. The 
main purpose of the ECB™s foreign reserves is to ensure that, whenever needed, the Eurosystem 
has a sufficient amount of liquid resources for its foreign exchange policy operations involving 
 non-EU currencies. The objectives for the management of the ECB™s foreign reserves are, in order 

of importance, liquidity, security and return. The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio consists of US dollars, Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. The US 
dollar and Japanese yen reserves are actively managed by the ECB and those euro area NCBs that 

wish to take part in this activity as agents for the ECB. Since January 2006 a ﬁcurrency specialisation 

modelﬂ has been in operation to increase the efficiency of the ECB™s investment operations. Under 

this scheme, each NCB that wishes to be involved in ECB foreign reserve management, or group of 

NCBs acting jointly for this purpose, is as a rule allocated a share in the US dollar or the Japanese 

yen portfolio.77 For more details, see the article entitled ﬁPortfolio management at the ECBﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin
, ECB, April 2006.95ECBAnnual Report2013The value of the ECB™s net foreign reserve assets8 at current exchange rates and market prices 
decreased from •64.8 billion at end-2012 to •54.8 billion at end-2013, of which •40.1 billion was 
in foreign currencies and •14.7 billion was in gold and SDRs. The marked decrease in the value of 

the ECB™s net foreign reserve assets was mainly the result of a significant decline in the gold price, 

combined with a 21.2% depreciation of the Japanese yen against the euro. Positive contributions 

from capital gains and interest income generated by portfolio management activities offset some of 

these losses. Applying end-2013 exchange rates, US dollar-denominated assets represented 82% of 

the foreign currency reserves, while those assets denominated in Japanese yen accounted for 18%. 

The value of gold and SDR holdings decreased, driven by the strong depreciation of gold by around 

31% in 2013 (as measured in euro terms).OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of the invested counterpart of the ECB™s paid-up capital, 

as well as amounts held in its general reserve fund and its provision against foreign exchange rate, 

interest rate, credit and gold price risks. The purpose of this portfolio is to provide the ECB with 

income to help cover its operating expenses.The portfolio is invested in euro-denominated fixed income assets. The value of the portfolio at 
current market prices increased from •18.9 billion at end-2012 to •20.0 billion at end-2013. The 
increase in market value was mainly due to an increase in the provision against foreign exchange 

rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks. Investment returns also contributed to this modest 

increase. Moreover, the ECB™s paid-up capital also increased slightly, as Croatia joined the EU 

(and thus the Croatian central bank joined the ESCB) on 1 July. The own funds portfolio continued to be managed in a largely passive way in 2013, in order 
to ensure that no inside information about central bank policy actions can have an impact on 

investment decisions.1.4 RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES RELATED TO INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AND SECURITIES HELD FOR 
MONETARY POLICY PURPOSES 
The financial risks to which the Eurosystem is exposed through the ECB™s investment activities 

and the Eurosystem™s holdings of securities in monetary policy portfolios are closely monitored 

and measured. Regular reports ensure that all stakeholders are adequately informed about the level 

of such risks, so that appropriate actions can be taken to mitigate them. In particular, a risk control 

framework, mainly composed of eligibility criteria and a limit system, is in place to mitigate risks. 

Compliance with the risk control framework is monitored on a daily basis. The Eurosystem™s stock of securities held for monetary policy purposes declined over the course 
of 2013 owing to redemptions and the absence of additional purchases, as the SMP and the CBPP2 

were terminated in 2012 and no OMTs were conducted. If OMTs were to be conducted, the financial 

risks entailed by potential purchases of securities would continue to be closely monitored and 

measured. Regarding the applicable risk control framework, the OMTs incorporate two additional 

risk-mitigating features compared with the SMP: first, the conditionality entailing that purchases of 

securities would only be conducted for limited periods, subject to a successful implementation of 
8 Net foreign reserve assets are calculated as official reserve assets excluding the net, marked-to-market value of foreign currency swaps, 
plus deposits in foreign currency with residents, minus future predetermined net drains on foreign currency holdings owing to repurchase 
and forward transactions. For detailed information on the data sources, see the ECB™s website.96ECBAnnual Report
2013economic policies; and, second, the focus of the purchases on instruments with a residual maturity 
of between one and three years. 2 PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSThe Eurosystem has the statutory task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems. 

Payment systems and securities clearing and settlement systems are fundamental infrastructures 

that are necessary for the proper functioning of market economies. They are indispensable for the 

efficient flow of payments for goods, services and financial assets, and their smooth functioning 

is crucial for the implementation of a central bank™s monetary policy and for maintaining the 

stability of and confidence in the currency, the financial system and the economy in general. For 

the performance of this task, the Eurosystem applies three approaches: it takes on an operational 

role, conducts oversight activities and acts as a catalyst (for further details on the second and third 

of these, see Sections 4 and 5 of Chapter 4). In terms of its operational role, the Eurosystem may, 

in accordance with the Statute of the ESCB, provide facilities to ensure efficient and sound clearing 

and payment systems.2.1 THE TARGET2 SYSTEMThe Eurosystem operates the TARGET2 system for large-value and urgent payments in euro. 

TARGET2 offers a real-time settlement service in central bank money and broad market coverage. 

It processes large-value and urgent transactions without any upper or lower limit on the value 

of payments and has also attracted a variety of other payments. The system is based on a single 

technical infrastructure, the Single Shared Platform (SSP). Three NCBs Œ the Deutsche Bundesbank, 

the Banque de France and the Banca d™Italia Œ jointly provide the SSP and operate it on behalf of 

the Eurosystem. By December 2013 TARGET2 had 1,606 direct participants. The overall number 

of banks (including branches and subsidiaries) that can be addressed worldwide through TARGET2 
reached some 55,000. In addition, TARGET2 settled the cash positions of 80 ancillary systems.TARGET2 OPERATIONSThe TARGET2 system functioned smoothly in 2013 and settled a large number of euro payments. 

The system™s market share remained stable, with 91% of the total value of payments in euro large-

value payment systems being executed via TARGET2. In 2013 the system processed a total of 

92,590,134 transactions, with a daily average of 363,099 transactions. The total value of TARGET2 

traffic in 2013 was •493,442 billion, with an average daily value of •1,935 billion. Table 11 

provides an overview of payment traffic in the TARGET2 system in 2013, comparing it with traffic 

in the previous year. In 2013 the overall availability
 9 of the SSP of TARGET2 reached 100%. Over the course of the year 100% of the payments in the SSP were processed within five minutes and the 

system™s positive performance met with the satisfaction of participants.COOPERATION WITH TARGET2 USERSThe Eurosystem maintains close relations with TARGET2 users. Regular meetings were held 

between the NCBs and national TARGET2 user groups in 2013. In addition, joint meetings of the 

Eurosystem™s Working Group on TARGET2 and the TARGET Working Group of the European 
credit sector associations took place on a semi-annual basis to discuss TARGET2 business issues 
9 The level of availability is the extent to which participants were able to use the TARGET2 system during their business hours without 
incident. 97ECBAnnual Report2013at the pan-European level. The ad hoc group composed of representatives from these two groups 
continued its work, addressing major changes that affect TARGET2, such as the connection of 

TARGET2-Securities (T2S) and the migration to the new industry standards (ISO 20022). Further 

strategic issues were addressed in the Contact Group on Euro Payments Strategy, a forum composed 

of senior representatives from commercial and central banks.MANAGEMENT OF NEW SYSTEM RELEASESThe Eurosystem continues to develop TARGET2 in order to further increase the level of service 

offered and to meet the needs of its participants. The 2013 release of TARGET2 was a major one, 

encompassing the changes related to the adaptation to T2S and a number of minor improvements 

to the system. While the minor improvements Œ which mainly related to the implementation of a 

new version of cash management messages Œ went live on 18
 November 2013, the T2S adaptations 
will only be activated with the launch of T2S, scheduled for June 2015. The T2S-related changes 

comprise all adaptations necessary to connect the two platforms, as well as a number of services 

that TARGET2 will offer to its participants to support their cash activities in T2S. In 2013 two consultations were launched in order to obtain users™ feedback on details relating to the 
migration of TARGET2 to ISO 20022 in November 2017.COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING IN TARGET2All euro area countries participate in TARGET2, as its use is mandatory for the settlement of all 

payment orders related to the Eurosystem™s monetary policy operations. Non-euro area EU central 

banks may connect to the TARGET2 system on a voluntary basis in order to facilitate the settlement 

of euro-denominated transactions in these countries. From a legal and business point of view, each 

central bank is responsible for managing its system component and for maintaining relationships 

with its participants. In addition, some financial institutions located in other EEA countries 

participate in TARGET2 via remote access. 24 central banks of the EU and their respective user 

communities are currently connected to TARGET2: the 18 euro area NCBs (including Latvijas 

Banka), the ECB and five central banks of non-euro area countries.102.2 TARGET2-SECURITIESTARGET2-Securities (T2S) is the future Eurosystem service for securities settlement in central 

bank money in Europe. The project is currently in the development phase and is due to go live in 

June 2015. Virtually all traded securities in Europe will be settled in T2S, leading to significant

2013economies of scale and a reduction of settlement costs. By removing the distinction between 
cross-border and domestic settlement, T2S will constitute a major breakthrough in the creation 

of an integrated capital market for Europe, providing a solid basis for increasing efficiency and 

competition in the entire post-trading sector. T2S will enable significant savings in terms of 

collateral and liquidity, a particularly valuable feature at a time when the demand for high-quality 

collateral is ever-increasing as a result of the financial turmoil and new regulatory developments. 
 It will harmonise market processes and thus facilitate back office streamlining.In 2013 two further central securities depositories (CSDs) Œ BNY Mellon CSD, a newly formed 


Group Œ signed the T2S Framework Agreement.
11 This brought the total number of CSDs 
participating in T2S to 24 at the end of 2013. Considerable progress was made in 2013 in adapting 

the CSDs™ infrastructure in view of their connection to T2S. The CSDs and their communities are 

now preparing for their user tests and migration.In March 2013 the Governing Council of the ECB approved the plan for CSDs to migrate to T2S 
in four waves (see Table 12). At least 24 CSDs and 20 central banks will migrate to T2S between 
 June 2015 and February 2017. Fixing the dates of the migration waves was an important 

achievement, as it provides participants with planning certainty with regard to their migration 

activities.In May 2013 the T2S community reached a mutual agreement that the programme plan was 
comprehensive and adequately reflected any agreed additional specifications, deliverables and 

planning elements for CSDs or central banks. SIA/Colt

The dedicated link solution offered by the Eurosystem was not taken up by 
any users, and there are therefore currently no plans to develop this service. In October 2013 the 

Eurosystem started its T2S user training programme based on a ﬁtrain the trainerﬂ approach. Work 

on developing the software for T2S was completed in 2013, and the Eurosystem is preparing the 

tools and resources for its acceptance tests for the T2S platform. The T2S project is thus moving 

forward according to plan.T2S continued to be a driver of post-trade harmonisation in Europe in 2013. In March a conference 
on post-trade harmonisation and financial integration in Europe was hosted by the ECB and the 

European Commission. The T2S Advisory Group™s third harmonisation report, which highlights the 

progress made on the harmonisation agenda in the T2S markets
 13, was presented at the conference. 
The Advisory Group made substantial progress in 2013, in terms of both setting standards and 

monitoring compliance. All 21 T2S markets
 are now being monitored, and standards have been set 
for 16 of the 24 harmonisation activities that were identified. Work on the definition of standards 

will not be completed until the proposed regulation on improving securities settlement in the EU 

and on CSDs Œ which should strongly improve the legal and competitive environment in which 

T2S operates Œ has been adopted. On 18 December 2013 a political agreement was reached on this 

CSD regulation proposed by the European Commission, which is of key importance for T2S. The 

fourth T2S harmonisation progress report was prepared over the course of 2013 and is scheduled 

for publication in spring 2014. For further details on T2S harmonisation activities and their impact 

on European financial integration, see Section 5 of Chapter 4. 2.3 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR CROSS-BORDER COLLATERALEligible assets may be used to collateralise all types of Eurosystem credit operation, not only at 

the domestic level but also across national borders. The cross-border mobilisation of collateral 

in the euro area is conducted mainly via the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) and 

through eligible links between euro area securities settlement systems (SSSs). Whereas the first 

solution is provided by the Eurosystem, the latter is a market-led initiative. In addition, cross-border 

collateral can be mobilised on the accounts of NCBs with a non-domestic (international) CSD on an 

exceptional basis.At the end of 2013 the amount of cross-border collateral (including both marketable and non-
marketable assets) held by the Eurosystem stood at •598 billion, down from •643 billion at the end 

of 2012. Overall, at the end of 2013 cross-border collateral represented 24.2% of the total collateral 

provided to the Eurosystem (compared with 22.8% in 2012).COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT SERVICESThe CCBM remained the main channel for transferring cross-border collateral in Eurosystem 

monetary policy and intraday credit operations in 2013. Assets held in custody through the CCBM 

decreased from •354 billion at the end of 2012 to •328 billion at the end of 2013. Cross-border 
collateral held on accounts of NCBs with a non-domestic (international) CSD amounted to •95 

billion at the end of 2013.Initially set up in 1999 as an interim solution building upon the principle of minimum harmonisation, 
the CCBM remains an important channel for mobilising collateral across borders. Following market

100ECBAnnual Report
2013participants™ requests, the Eurosystem agreed to remove the requirement to repatriate (marketable) 
assets from investor CSDs to issuer CSDs before they are mobilised as collateral through the 

CCBM. In addition, preparations are under way to allow tri-party collateral management services 

which are currently only used domestically also to be used on a cross-border basis. The repatriation 

requirement is scheduled to be removed in May 2014, and the cross-border use of tri-party collateral 

management services will go live in September 2014.Issues related to euro securities settlement and collateral mobilisation in Eurosystem credit 
operations were discussed in the Contact Group on Euro Securities Infrastructures, which is a forum 

for representatives of market infrastructures, market participants and central banks.ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSCross-border collateral can also be mobilised by using links between national SSSs. However, such 

links are only eligible for use in Eurosystem credit operations if they have been positively assessed 

under the Eurosystem™s user assessment framework.14 Once the securities have been transferred to another SSS via eligible links, they can be used through local procedures in the same way as 

domestic collateral. The amount of collateral mobilised through direct and relayed links increased 

from •156 billion at the end of 2012 to •174 billion at the end of 2013. In 2013 8 new direct links and 15 new relayed links were added to the list of eligible links and 
5 direct links were removed. In total, there were 55 direct and 23 relayed links available to 

counterparties at the end of 2013, of which only a limited number are actively used.3 BANKNOTES AND COINSIn accordance with Article 128 of the Treaty, the Governing Council of the ECB has the exclusive 

right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes within the EU. The ECB and the NCBs may issue 
these banknotes.2013 saw the launch of the first denomination of the second series of euro banknotes, the •5 
 (as described in further detail at the end of Section 3.3 of this chapter).3.1 THE CIRCULATION OF BANKNOTES AND COINS 
DEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINSAt the end of 2013 there were 16.5 billion euro banknotes in circulation, with a total value of 
•956.2 billion. This compares with 15.7 billion banknotes, with a total value of •912.6 billion, 

at the end of 2012 (see Chart 36). In terms of value, the •50 and the •500 banknotes accounted 

for the largest shares of the banknotes in circulation, standing at 36% and 30% respectively at 

the end of the year. The •50 banknote was the most-used denomination in terms of volume, 

accounting for 42% of all euro banknotes in circulation (see Chart 37). In 2013 the annual growth 

rate of banknotes in circulation was 4.8% in value terms and 5.3% in volume terms. The •100 

banknotes showed the highest annual growth rate, at 8.4%, closely followed by the •50 and •200 

banknotes, at 8.2% and 8.0% respectively, in terms of both volume and value. Circulation of 
14 In September 2013 the Eurosystem established a new framework for the assessment of SSSs and links (see the press release of 
 27 September 2013 on the ECB™s website). 101ECBAnnual Report2013the •500 banknote, which had shown considerable growth in the past, has been declining since 
the fourth quarter of 2012. The decline has been compensated for by an increased demand for 

•100 banknotes.It is estimated that, in terms of value, 20
-25% of the euro banknotes in circulation are held outside 
the euro area, predominantly in countries neighbouring the euro area. In 2013 net shipments of 

euro banknotes by financial institutions to regions outside the euro area were at the same level as in 

2012. Euro banknotes, mainly high-value denominations, are held outside the euro area as a store of 

value and for settling transactions on international markets.In 2013 the total number of euro coins in circulation (i.e. net circulation excluding stocks held by 
the euro area NCBs) increased by 3.8%, standing at 106.0 billion. At the end of 2013 the value of 

coins in circulation stood at •24.2 billion, 2.3% higher than at the end of 2012.BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEMIn 2013 the euro area NCBs issued 32.7 billion banknotes worth •1,017.8 billion, while 31.6
 billion  banknotes worth •969.0 billion were returned to them. These figures were similar to those 

recorded in 2012. 33.7 billion banknotes were processed using fully automated banknote 

processing machines, which checked the banknotes for both authenticity and fitness for circulation 

in order to maintain the quality and integrity of the banknotes in circulation in accordance with 

the common minimum sorting standards established by the Eurosystem. In that process, some 

6.1 billion banknotes were identified for destruction, largely because they were found to be unfit for 

circulation. The replacement rate
15 of the banknotes in circulation was 45% for the denominations 
•5 to •50 and 8% for the remaining denominations. The overall replacement rate increased slightly 

from 38% in 2012 to 39% in 2013. This rise can largely be explained by the issuance scenario for

2013the new •5 banknote, which foresaw that NCBs would destroy all •5 banknotes of the first series 
that were returned to them. At the end of 2013 half of all •5 banknotes in circulation were of the 

second series.The average return frequency
 16 of banknotes in circulation was 2.0 at end-2013, meaning that, on 
average, a banknote returned to a euro area NCB around every six months. The return frequencies 
were 0.3 for •500 banknotes, 0.4 for •200 banknotes and 0.7 for •100 banknotes, while the 

return frequencies of the denominations which are typically used for transactions were higher 
 (1.4 for •50 banknotes, 3.2 for •20 banknotes, 4.0 for •10 banknotes and 2.3 for •5 banknotes).3.2 BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITING AND COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCECOUNTERFEIT EURO BANKNOTESIn 2013 the National Analysis Centres 17 received some 670,000 counterfeit euro banknotes. When 
compared with the number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation, the proportion of counterfeits 

remains at a very low level. Long-term developments in the quantity of counterfeits removed from 

circulation are shown in Chart 38. Counterfeiters tend to target the •20 and •50 banknotes, which 

in 2013 accounted for 40.4% and 39.6% of total counterfeits respectively. Further details of the 

denominational breakdown are shown in Chart 39.Although confidence in the security of the euro is fully justified by the ongoing anti-counterfeiting 
measures of European and international authorities, this should not give rise to complacency. The 

ECB continues to advise the public to remain alert to the possibility of fraud, to remember the 

ﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ test,
18 and never to rely on just one security feature. In addition, training is offered

The ECB™s well-established cooperation with Europol and the European Commission also serves 

this goal.COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCE AT THE GLOBAL LEVELCooperation on counterfeit deterrence goes beyond the European level. The Eurosystem participates 

actively in the work of the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group.
19 The ECB hosts the International Counterfeit Deterrence Centre (ICDC), which acts as the technical centre for this 

group. The ICDC maintains a website
20 which provides information and guidance concerning the reproduction of banknote images, as well as links to country-specific websites.3.3 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION AND ISSUANCEPRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTSIn 2013 NCBs were responsible for the production of 8 billion euro banknotes, with the new 

•10 banknote, to be introduced in September 2014 (see below), accounting for 4.5
 billion of that 

total (around 56% of the banknotes produced). The allocation of euro banknote production continued 

to be based on decentralised production with pooling, an arrangement initially established in 2002. 

Under this arrangement, each euro area NCB is responsible for the procurement of an allocated 

share of the total requirement for certain denominations (see Table 13).RECIRCULATION OF BANKNOTESWhen putting euro banknotes back into circulation, cash handlers (credit institutions, cash in transit 

companies and, under certain circumstances, other economic agents, such as retailers and casinos) 

must adhere to the rules laid down in Decision ECB/2010/14 on the authenticity and fitness checking 

and recirculation of euro banknotes.21 This Decision aims in particular to ensure that all banknotes 
distributed to the public via cash dispensers have 

been checked for both authenticity and fitness. 

According to data reported by cash handlers to 

the euro area NCBs, around one-third of the total 

number of euro banknotes that were put back into 

circulation in 2013 were recirculated via cash 

dispensers after having been processed by cash 

handlers using banknote handling machines. 
The Eurosystem continued its efforts to help 
banknote equipment manufacturers to ensure 

that their machines meet the ECB™s standards for 

machinery used by cash handlers to check euro 

banknotes prior to recirculation. It also supported 

third parties in adapting their banknote handling 

machines to the new series of banknotes.

2013THE EXTENDED CUSTODIAL INVENTORY PROGRAMMEFollowing an open tender procedure among banknote wholesale banks in 2012, the contract for 
the operation of an Extended Custodial Inventory (ECI) for euro banknotes was awarded to Bank 

of America and Bank of China (Hong Kong) in 2013. Under the new contract, both banks started 

operating an ECI in Hong Kong. In addition, Bank of America began operations at its ECI in Miami. 
The ECI programme aims to ensure the smooth circulation of euro banknotes in geographically 

remote regions and to provide detailed statistical data on the international use of euro banknotes.THE SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTESThe first denomination of the second series of euro banknotes, the •5, was launched on 2
 May 2013.  This second series is called the Europa series and features a portrait of Europa, a figure from 

Greek mythology, in the watermark and hologram. It will have the same denominations as the first 

series of banknotes and most of the same design elements.
22 The Eurosystem™s work on the new 
series in 2013 also focused on the large-scale production of the new •10 banknote and the ongoing 

development of the subsequent denominations of the new series. The Eurosystem also continued 

to help various stakeholders to prepare for the introduction of the new •10 banknote, providing 

extensive information and opportunities to conduct tests and adapt banknote handling machines and 

authentication devices to the new banknotes. The Governing Council decided on 20
 December 2013 that the new •10 banknote will be 
introduced on 23
 September 2014. The exact timing of the issuance of the other denominations of 
the Europa series will be determined at a later stage. It is anticipated that the new banknotes will be 
introduced gradually over several years in ascending order. The Eurosystem will inform the public, 
cash handlers and banknote equipment manufacturers well in advance about the modalities of the 

introduction of the new banknotes. The banknotes of the first series will remain legal tender for a 

relatively long period and their withdrawal from circulation will be gradual and communicated to 

the public well in advance. Even after the banknotes of the first series have been withdrawn, it will 

be possible to exchange them at the euro area NCBs for an unlimited period of time.4 STATISTICSThe ECB, assisted by the NCBs, develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a wide range of 

statistics which support the monetary policy of the euro area, various other tasks of the ESCB and 

the tasks of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). These statistics are also used by public 

authorities, financial market participants, the media and the general public. In 2013 regular euro 

area statistics continued to be provided in a smooth and timely manner. In accordance with the 

annually reviewed statistical work programme, significant efforts were devoted to meeting the 

increasing demand for higher-frequency statistics providing broader coverage for the fulfilment of 

the mandates of the ECB and the ESRB (see Section 2 of Chapter 3).Moreover, the ECB™s statistical function has worked to meet the significant challenges posed by the 
need to establish a new collection framework for providing meaningful statistics and risk data as part 

of the preparatory work for the new Single Supervisory Mechanism (see Section 1 of Chapter 4).22 For more details, see http://www.newfaceoftheeuro.eu
105ECBAnnual Report20134.1 NEW AND ENHANCED EURO AREA STATISTICSIn April 2013 the results were published of the first wave of the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey, a joint Eurosystem project carried out with the support of the national 
statistical institutes of three euro area countries. This survey provides micro-level data on, for 

example, households™ real and financial assets, liabilities, consumption and saving, income and 

employment, and future pension entitlements. Its results contribute to the Eurosystem™s knowledge 

of the euro area™s economic and financial structure and to a better understanding of the monetary 

transmission mechanism and the impact of macroeconomic shocks on financial stability. The results 

of the survey were published with a report presenting the methodology.Since August 2013 MFI interest rate statistics have been complemented by new composite cost-
of-borrowing indicators for non-financial corporations and for households. These indicators make 

it easier to assess the retail bank interest rate pass-through in the euro area at times of financial 

fragmentation. The dissemination and communication of statistics were also improved by publishing the ESRB 
risk dashboard in the Statistical Data Warehouse (SDW) and incorporating direct links to the 

SDW in press releases, beginning with the press release on euro area securities issues statistics in 

September 2013. In addition, the ECB launched a new Statistics Paper Series, which provides a new channel for statisticians, economists and other staff to publish innovative work on statistics and related 

methodologies. 4.2 OTHER STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENTSThe ESCB continued its work on enhancing the availability and quality of statistics on the basis of 

micro-databases, as these provide more flexibility in meeting user needs and help to minimise the 

burden for reporting agents.In May 2013 the ESCB deployed a register of all financial institutions in the EU, including large 
banking and insurance groups Œ the enhanced Register of Institutions and Affiliates Database 

(RIAD). Data on individual MFIs and other financial institutions are entered by statistics 

departments in the ESCB, and the updated lists are published on the ECB™s website (refreshed 

daily for credit institutions and quarterly for investment funds and financial vehicle corporations). 
 In addition to facilitating the classification of financial institutions for statistical reporting purposes, 

the enhanced RIAD helps the assessment of collateral in market operations and will also support 

the Single Supervisory Mechanism. To increase its usefulness, the RIAD will be interoperable with 

the EuroGroups Register of (mainly) non-financial enterprises in Europe, which is being developed 

and run in parallel by Eurostat.With reference to banking statistics, the structural financial indicators and the consolidated banking 
data now provide the statistical basis for the Banking Structures Report, which was made possible 

in part by the substantially improved publication schedule for these statistical datasets in 2013.The legislative process to align the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95) with the System of 
National Accounts 2008 and the sixth edition of the IMF™s ﬁBalance of Payments and International 
106ECBAnnual Report
2013Investment Position Manualﬂ was finalised in June 2013 with the publication of the European 
System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). The revision of all related ECB and EU legal acts in order to 

ensure that the new standards are implemented as from September 2014 was conducted in parallel. 

In this context, the Governing Council approved a comprehensive revision of the legal acts in the 

field of monetary and financial statistics, also including further improvements in those statistics 

to meet essential new requirements for the purposes of, primarily, monetary policy and financial 

stability analysis. The revisions are contained in Regulation ECB/2013/33 concerning the balance 

sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector, Regulation ECB/2013/34 concerning statistics 

on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions, Regulation ECB/2013/38 concerning 

statistics on the assets and liabilities of investment funds, Regulation ECB/2013/39 on statistical 

reporting requirements for post office giro institutions that receive deposits from non-monetary 

financial institution euro area residents, and Regulation ECB/2013/40 concerning statistics on 

the assets and liabilities of financial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation transactions. 

Guideline ECB/2013/23 on government finance statistics and Guideline ECB/2013/24 on the 

statistical reporting requirements of the European Central Bank in the field of quarterly financial 

accounts were also updated in 2013.In March 2013 the ECB adopted Guideline ECB/2013/7, which defines the procedures to be 
followed by NCBs when reporting to the ECB statistical information derived from the data collected 

under the new Regulation ECB/2012/24 concerning statistics on holdings of securities, covering 
both holdings by sectors of the economy and holdings by selected reporting banking groups. 
The requirements as regards holdings by sectors are for security-by-security data on holdings of 

securities by euro area (financial and non-financial) investors, as well as on holdings by non-euro 

area investors of securities issued by euro area residents which are kept in custody in the euro area. 

The data collection will start in March 2014 with reference to data for December 2013.Payment statistics have been considerably enhanced by the new Regulation ECB/2013/43, which 
primarily covers developments relating to the Single Euro Payments Area, notably Regulation 

(EU) No 260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14
 March 2012 establishing 
technical and business requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and amending 

Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 (see Section 4 of Chapter 4). The new ECB Regulation, which 

also enhances some existing indicators with amended methodology and/or deeper geographical 

breakdowns at counterparty level, is addressed to payment service providers, electronic money 

issuers and payment system operators resident in the euro area countries. It is accompanied by a 

recommendation addressed to national authorities in the non-euro area EU Member States to enable 

them to provide the same set of data.In addition, other important datasets are under development. The ESCB is developing enhanced 
statistics for the insurance sector, which would to the extent possible reuse data to be collected 

using Solvency II quantitative reporting templates, as designed by the European Insurance and 

Occupational Pensions Authority. Work is also under way to harmonise a core set of data attributes 

and design a pilot area for data from credit registers or other similar loan-level datasets with a view 

to reusing information to meet various statistical and analytical needs.The ECB continued its close working relationship with Eurostat and with other international 
organisations in 2013. At the European level, the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance 

of Payments Statistics (CMFB) has since 1991 been the main forum for coordinating the work of 

statisticians from the ESCB and the European Statistical System (ESS), which is composed of the 
107ECBAnnual Report2013national statistical institutes of the EEA and Eurostat. In recent years, the CMFB has played an 
important advisory role as regards statistical issues related to excessive deficit procedure decisions. 

In April 2013, in order to further strengthen cooperation in areas of shared responsibility or common 

interest, the ESCB and the ESS signed a Memorandum of Understanding, which establishes a 

new structure alongside the CMFB, the European Statistical Forum, to enhance cooperation at the 

strategic level.The ECB also contributes to the improvement of economic and financial statistics at the global 
level, notably via its participation in the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics 

(IAG) and the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX), together with the BIS, Eurostat, 

the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World Bank. The IAG coordinates and monitors 

the statistical initiatives supported by the finance ministers and central bank governors of the 

G20 to close global information gaps. The ECB continued to contribute to the Principal Global 

Indicators website, which presents quarterly main economic and financial indicators for countries 

that are members of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board. Moreover, in October 2013 the 

aggregate Consumer Price Index of the G20 economies was published for the first time by the 

ECB, Eurostat, the IMF and the OECD. It followed the first publication of the quarterly G20 GDP 

aggregate in spring 2012. To ensure the timely implementation of the statistical initiatives, the ECB 

advocates an enhanced institutional framework for the statistical work at the G20 level. The ECB 

also continued to contribute to the work of the Financial Stability Board Data Gaps Initiative on a 

common data template for systemically important global financial institutions. Together with the 

United Nations, the ECB published the ﬁHandbook of National Accounting Œ Financial Production, 

Flows and Stocks in the System of National Accountsﬂ, explaining how the activity of banks, other 

financial intermediaries, insurance corporations and pension funds is reflected in financial statistics. 

Moreover, the ECB continued to chair the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities, 

which currently comprises 39 international organisations with a statistical mandate.In order to maintain the public™s confidence in the statistics produced by the ESCB, upon which 
policy decisions are based, it is important for the ESCB to demonstrate that it adheres to the highest 

quality standards, and that the statistics are easily accessible. For this reason, in May 2013 the 

Governing Council approved the annual assessment of the availability and quality of the various 

statistics that are compiled by the Eurosystem on the basis of ECB legal acts. It also authorised the 

publication of the 2012 quality report on monetary and financial statistics,
23 produced in accordance 
with the ECB™s Statistics Quality Framework.5 ECONOMIC RESEARCHConsistent with the approach adopted throughout the Eurosystem, the purpose of research activities 

at the ECB is: (i) to provide research results relevant for monetary policy and other Eurosystem 

tasks, (ii) to maintain and use econometric models in order to construct economic forecasts and 

projections and compare the impact of alternative policy choices, and (iii) to communicate with 

the academic and central bank research community, for example through the publication of 

research results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and by participating in and organising research 

conferences. The following two sections analyse the main research areas and activities in 2013.23 Available on the ECB™s website.
108ECBAnnual Report
20135.1 RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTSEconomic research at the ECB is performed in a decentralised manner by several business areas 
according to their needs and expertise. The Directorate General Research (DG/R) is charged 

with producing high-quality economic research, mainly in the areas of macroeconomics and 

financial economics. In order to maximise synergies among economists working in different fields 

and to enhance the contribution of research to policy work, DG/R economists are allocated to 
 11 thematic teams working on the following topics: (1) modelling and analysis of countries; 
 (2) area-wide modelling and analysis; (3) forecasting and business cycle analysis; (4) international 

macroeconomics and finance; (5) micro-foundations and the transmission mechanism of monetary 

policy; (6) monetary policy strategy and fiscal policy; (7) monetary policy implementation; 
 (8) monetary analysis; (9) macro-financial linkages and systemic risk policy; (10) financial stability 

indicators and asset pricing; and (11) financial institutions and structure.DG/R is also responsible for coordinating the research work conducted across the ECB. Its Director General chairs the Research Coordination Committee (RCC), which aligns research activities at the 

ECB with the requirements of the institution and the needs of its policy processes.In 2013 research work coordinated by the RCC was grouped into four broad areas: (i) the changing 
economic and financial structure and output growth; (ii) monetary policy transmission, including 

the changing operational framework and implementation; (iii) interaction between monetary 

and fiscal policies and financial stability amid a changing EU institutional framework; and 
 (iv) forecasting, scenario analysis and country surveillance tools. In the context of the first research area, special emphasis was given to price determination and 
growth enhancement drivers. This work benefited from new micro datasets that were either 

acquired from commercial providers or developed by two research networks, CompNet (which 

addresses issues related to competitiveness) and the Household Finance and Consumption Network. 
 A further important area of work was the analysis of interlinkages between macro, fiscal and 

financial developments, particularly in the context of the segmentation of financial markets.In the second area, several studies were conducted on the impact of standard and non-standard 
monetary policy measures, forward guidance and communication. Another set of studies dealt with 

real-financial linkages, transmission mechanisms, market segmentation, the role of the banking 

sector and monetary policy implementation. The third area covers a number of distinct lines of research. Macro-prudential analyses and tools 
continued to be developed in the context of the Macro-prudential Research Network. In particular, 

considerable progress was made in developing theoretical and empirical tools which integrate 

financial instability into models of the aggregate economy. Other projects studied government 

bond yields and/or risk premia in the context of the euro area sovereign debt crisis, as well as 
the development of composite indicators of systemic stress. A number of research projects used 

new data from the TARGET2 system to study the euro area interbank market. Following the 

first wave of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey, a complete dataset (comprising 
 62,000 households in 15 countries) was made available for Eurosystem users and external 

researchers. Early results from the empirical analysis of these data were discussed at a conference 

held in Frankfurt in October 2013. Finally, against the background of ongoing changes in Europe, 

increased attention was devoted to institutional aspects of EU/euro area governance.109ECBAnnual Report2013Fourth, in the area of forecasting, scenario analysis and country surveillance, the focus was on 
refining existing tools and extending their coverage to smaller euro area countries. Close attention 

was paid to enhancing the instruments that complement the forecasting process (supporting the 

analysis of, for example, the role of uncertainty and confidence), as well as the modelling of cross-

country imbalances, spillovers and adjustment.5.2 DI
SSEMINATION OF RESEARCH: PUBLICATIONS AND CONFERENCESAs in previous years, ECB staff research was published in the ECB™s Working Paper Series and 

Occasional Paper Series. 123 Working Papers and 13 Occasional Papers were published in 2013. 
A total of 93 Working Papers were written or co-written by ECB staff, a large number together 
with other Eurosystem economists, with the remainder being written by external visitors attending 
conferences and workshops, participating in research networks or spending a prolonged period at 

the ECB for the completion of a research project.
24 As is now the established norm, most of the 
papers are eventually expected to be published in leading peer-reviewed academic journals. In 2013 

ECB staff published 56 articles in academic journals.Another regular ECB publication is the Research Bulletin,
25 which is used to disseminate research 
work of general interest to a wide audience. In 2013 two issues of the Research Bulletin were 
published. Articles covered a variety of topics, such as ﬁIntroducing systemic financial instability 

into macroeconomics: how to meet the challenge?ﬂ, ﬁMacroeconomic effects of large-scale asset 

purchase programsﬂ, ﬁWealth heterogeneity and the response of consumption to shocksﬂ and 

ﬁHeterogeneous transmission mechanism and the credit channel in the euro areaﬂ.The ECB organised or co-organised 29 conferences and workshops on research topics in 2013. 
Co-organised conferences involved central banks, both within and outside the Eurosystem. As in 

previous years, most of the conferences and workshops were related to specific research activities, 

as outlined above. The programmes for these events and the papers presented are available on the 

ECB™s website.Another long-standing mechanism for fostering interaction between the ECB and the broader 
community of economic researchers is the organisation of seminar series. Two are of particular 

relevance: the Joint Lunchtime Seminars, co-organised with the Deutsche Bundesbank and the 

Center for Financial Studies, and the Invited Speaker Seminars. These two series comprise weekly 

seminars at which external researchers are invited to present their recent work at the ECB. The ECB 

also organises research seminars outside the scope of these two series on a more ad hoc basis.6 OTHER TASKS AND ACTIVITIES6.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITION OF MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED ACCESSPursuant to Article 271(d) of the Treaty, the ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the

2013the Treaty and Council Regulations (EC) Nos 3603/93
 and 3604/93. Article 123 prohibits the ECB 
and the NCBs from providing overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility to governments 
and EU institutions or bodies, as well as from purchasing debt instruments directly from them. 

Article 124 prohibits any measure, not based on prudential considerations, which establishes 

privileged access by governments and EU institutions or bodies to financial institutions. In parallel 

with the Governing Council, the European Commission monitors Member States™ compliance with 

the above provisions.The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ secondary market purchases of debt instruments 
issued by the domestic public sector, the public sector of other Member States and EU institutions 
and bodies. According to the recitals of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the acquisition of 

public sector debt instruments in the secondary market must not be used to circumvent the objective 

of Article 123 of the Treaty. Such purchases should not become a form of indirect monetary 

financing of the public sector.The monitoring exercise conducted for 2013 confirmed that the provisions of Articles 123 and 124 
of the Treaty and the related Council Regulations were in general respected.The liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) raises serious monetary financing 
concerns. These concerns could be somewhat mitigated by the disposal strategy of the Central Bank 

of Ireland.6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONSArticles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty require that the ECB be consulted on any proposed EU or 

draft national legislation falling within its fields of competence.
26 All ECB opinions are published 
on the ECB™s website. ECB opinions on proposed EU legislation are also published in the Official 

Journal of the European Union.In 2013 the ECB adopted 9 opinions on proposed EU legislation and 85 on draft national legislation 
falling within the ECB™s fields of competence. A list of the opinions adopted in 2013 and early 

2014 is annexed to this Annual Report (see Annex 1).OPINIONS ON PROPOSED EU LEGISLATIONThe ECB opinions issued at the request of the European Parliament, the EU Council and the 

European Commission concerned, among other things, the establishment of a Single Resolution 

Mechanism (SRM);
27 the facility for providing financial assistance for non-euro area EU Member 
States; the new regulatory regime for indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and 

financial contracts; and the revision of the Payment Services Directive.In an opinion on the establishment of a facility for providing assistance for Member States whose 
currency is not the euro,28 the ECB welcomed the efforts to try to make, insofar as is possible, identical instruments available to both euro area and non-euro area countries, and the efforts to 

synchronise the procedures for granting such assistance. The ECB considered that granting 
26 The United Kingdom is exempt from the consultation obligation, pursuant to the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is annexed to the Treaty, OJ C 83, 30.3.2010, p. 284.27 CON/2013/76. This opinion is discussed in detail in Section 1.2 of Chapter 4.
28 CON/2013/2.111ECBAnnual Report2013credit lines for assistance to non-euro area countries whose economic and financial situation is 
fundamentally sound was compatible with the Treaty. At the same time, the ECB considered a 

close interpretation of the eligibility criteria when assessing access to the credit lines, and strict 

compliance with them over time, to be important. Regarding its own role in the administration of 

financial assistance, the ECB reiterated the fact that the accounts to be used for the management 

of this financial assistance at the NCBs and at the ECB would not provide for the possibility of 

an overdraft. Finally, the ECB noted that its role in the proposed regulation to cooperate with 

the European Commission regarding, among other things, the assessment of the sustainability of 

general government debt and current or potential financial needs, the preparation of macroeconomic 

adjustment programmes and the monitoring of their progress via regular missions would have to be 

organised within its mandate and with respect for its independence.The ECB opinion on a proposal for a regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial 
instruments and financial contracts
 29 considered the regulatory measures to be justified and 
proportionate to the deficiencies that had been identified in the benchmark-setting process. The 

opinion supported the proposal™s objectives to establish a common set of rules and regulations at 

the EU level for the benchmark-setting process for financial instruments and financial contracts in 

the interests of the integrity and reliability of financial benchmarks, the benchmark-setting process 

and the wider concern of protecting investors and consumers. As regards the reform of critical 
interest rate benchmarks, the ECB supported the move towards transaction-based benchmarks and 

the inclusion of rules on mandatory contribution. The opinion suggested that the new regulatory 

requirements should not inadvertently dissuade new benchmark contributors, nor discourage too 

strongly current contributors, especially during the period of transition to possible new reference 

rates. The ECB noted that the thresholds for mandatory contribution may need to be reviewed 

to deal with cases of gradual defections by panel banks. Generally, however, the ECB supported 

the attempts to facilitate market choice in a changing financial system as it would enable users to 

choose reference rates which better match their needs. The ECB opinion on the proposed revision of the Payment Services Directive 30 expressed strong support for the objectives and the general content of the proposed directive and in particular for the 
expansion of the list of payment services to include payment initiation services. The ECB welcomed 

the harmonisation and enhancement of operational and security requirements for payment service 

providers, as well as the strengthening of the enforcement powers of the competent authorities. The 

ECB supported the limitation of Member States™ discretion in certain areas such as payment service 

provider and payer liability, which had led to considerable divergence in the application of the rules 

across the EU and consequently to the fragmentation of retail payment markets. In addition, the 

ECB made a number of comments relating to topics such as definitions, the scope of application, 

consumer protection and operational security.OPINIONS ON DRAFT NATIONAL LEGISLATIONThere were a significant number of consultations by national authorities, many of which concerned 
measures relating to financial market stability.31Several Member States consulted the ECB on measures for strengthening bank stability and on 

bank reorganisation and recapitalisation measures.

2013bank stability in Slovenia,
33 the ECB welcomed the efforts of the authorities to foster the Slovenian 
banking sector and noted that the envisaged measures should best be embedded in a comprehensive financial sector strategy. In this context, the ECB recommended conducting an independent 

system-wide asset quality review and a fresh stress test using appropriately severe assumptions.
34 With respect to the transfer of impaired assets to the Bank Asset Management Company (BAMC), 

primarily in exchange for bonds issued by the BAMC and guaranteed by the state, the ECB 

advocated implementing cash protocol arrangements
 35 to ensure the timely repayment of such 
bonds. In a subsequent opinion on bank reorganisation, the ECB welcomed the strengthening of 

the tools and procedures available to Banka Slovenije for the effective reorganisation of distressed 

banks. However, the ECB also reminded the authorities of the need to ensure: (i)
 the ability of 

Banka Slovenije to perform its ESCB-related tasks; (ii)
 the appropriate separation of its tasks; 
(iii) the later review of the law in the light of the future directive establishing a framework for the 
recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms
 36 (BRRD), and the development of the SSM; and, where applicable, (iv) compliance of the measures with EU state aid rules.37In the context of the recapitalisation of credit institutions in Greece, the ECB supported the 

reinstatement of existing shareholders™ pre-emption rights, enabling the efficient and effective 

participation of private investors in the recapitalisation of Greek banks.
38 In another opinion,
39 the ECB welcomed the draft provisions clarifying the ECB™s observer status within the Hellenic 

Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), but at the same time considered that the competences and 

responsibilities of the HFSF™s governing bodies should be clarified further to make the decision-

making process more effective. The ECB adopted opinions on bank reorganisation measures in Spain,
40 including one on the creation of the Asset Management Company for Assets Resulting from Bank Restructuring (SAREB),
41 in relation to which an external Monitoring Commission was set up, in which the ECB assumed an 
observer role. The ECB was also consulted on a new role for the Spanish Deposit Guarantee Fund 

related to the purchase of shares not listed on an official market and issued by credit institutions in 

the context of the burden-sharing exercises.
42 Furthermore, the ECB was consulted on several draft 
laws, specific to the Spanish jurisdiction, related, among other things, to improving the functioning 

of the mortgage market by reinforcing the independence of valuation agencies,
43 and to the reform of savings banks.44A number of Member States consulted the ECB on measures related to crisis planning, early 

intervention, and the recovery and resolution of credit and other institutions.
45 In these cases the draft laws were adopted ahead of the related EU acts. Although the ECB welcomed the introduction 

of a comprehensive bank resolution framework, it recommended that the relevant laws be reviewed 

in the light of the future BRRD and the development of the SSM.
46 The ECB noted that recovery

swift and effective remedial action, and that it was possible to extend the requirement to draw 

up such plans to all credit institutions, and not only to the ﬁpotentially systemicﬂ ones.
47 In the context of the restructuring of systemic institutions, the ECB considered that restructuring a non-

viable entity as a going concern (i.e. an ﬁopen bank scenarioﬂ) instead of resolving it as a gone 

concern (i.e. a ﬁclosed bank scenarioﬂ) should only be considered under exceptional circumstances, 

where the orderly resolution of a credit institution would have seriously damaging effects on the 
stability of the financial system, with a heightened risk of contagion across borders.
48 As regards the framework for the liquidation of credit institutions in Greece, the ECB welcomed the draft 

provisions increasing the protection of the value of assets in liquidation and, ultimately, of creditors™ 

interests, but raised concerns about the interaction with the special liquidation framework, possible 

conflicts of interest, the need to provide more guidance to liquidators, the control exercised over 

them and the safeguarding of central bank independence.49The ECB adopted opinions on draft legislation on public finances in Luxembourg and Estonia.
50  In this context, the ECB acknowledged that an NCB commonly monitors various types of 
information in order to properly assess current and prospective developments that are relevant for 

monetary policy. However, an NCB™s role should not go beyond monitoring activities that result 

from or are linked Œ directly or indirectly Œ to the discharge of its monetary policy mandate. If an 

NCB takes up the monitoring activities set out in Article
 5 of Regulation (EU) No
 473/2013 and 
Article 4 of Directive 2011/85/EU, the monetary policy mandate and the independence of the NCB 
risk being undermined. More generally, a formal mandate for an NCB to assess forecasts and fiscal 

developments implies a function for the NCB in the fiscal policy-making process. The ECB noted 

that, if an NCB were to be thus entrusted with a share of the responsibility for fiscal policy, the 

institutional separation between fiscal and monetary policy would become blurred.The ECB considered several draft laws aimed at implementing Recommendation ESRB/2011/3 
of the European Systemic Risk Board of 22
 December 2011 on the macro-prudential mandate 
of national authorities.
51 In this regard, it was recalled that the ECB and the NCBs should play a 
leading role in macro-prudential oversight, given their expertise and existing responsibilities in the 

area of financial stability. At the same time, the performance of macro-prudential tasks by an NCB 

should not affect: (i) the NCB™s institutional, functional and financial independence; or (ii) the 

ESCB™s performance of its tasks under the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.52In an opinion related to deposit-taking by the Hungarian Treasury, the ECB stated that deposit-

taking placed the Treasury in direct competition with banks, and its deposit services to households 

should therefore be ring-fenced from the rest of its functions. Furthermore, the Treasury should 

therefore be subject to the same regulatory, supervisory and tax burden as commercial banks in order 

to avoid the Treasury having an advantage over commercial banks in attracting deposits.
53 In two 
opinions on the integrated Hungarian supervisory framework,
54 the ECB welcomed the integration 
of the supervisory authority into the Magyar Nemzeti Bank, but at the same time expressed serious 

concerns about the execution and timing of the integration. The opinions furthermore raised serious 

concerns as regards central bank independence and the prohibition of monetary financing as a result

2013of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank being obliged to hire all staff of the supervisory authority and being 
held liable for all obligations of the integrated supervisory authority. The ECB underlined the importance of compliance with the monetary financing prohibition in an 
opinion 55 on the Statute of the Bank of Greece, which expressly enables the latter to transfer to the 
Greek state its income accruing from its Securities Markets Programme portfolio. Furthermore, 

the ECB reiterated the criteria which need to be satisfied to comply with the monetary financing 

prohibition where a state guarantee is used as collateral accepted by Narodowy Bank Polski for 

liquidity granted to individual credit unions.56Several Member States consulted the ECB on limitations on cash payments,
57 in the context of 
which the ECB stressed that such limitations, if established for public reasons, are not incompatible 

with the status of legal tender of euro banknotes and coins, provided that other lawful means for 

the settlement of monetary debts are available.
58 They should, however, be proportionate to the objectives pursued, such as preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism,
59 and should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these objectives, especially in view of the fact 

that the restrictive measures may also affect relatively low-value payments.60In an opinion on means of payment and payment systems in France,
61 the ECB emphasised the 
general principle that the tasks assigned to the Eurosystem by the Treaty and the Statute of the 

ESCB have to be fulfilled exclusively by the ECB and the NCBs. The ECB furthermore elaborated 

that third parties may be entrusted by an NCB with the conduct of activities that offer limited 

room for discretion, provided that the activities are of an ancillary and preparatory nature, that the 

assessment of any discretionary elements remains with the commissioning NCB, and that certain 

additional conditions are fulfilled.CASES OF NON-COMPLIANCEIn 2013 the ECB recorded 21 cases of non-compliance with the obligation to consult on draft 

national legislation.62 The following 14 cases were considered clear and important.63The Austrian authorities failed to consult the ECB on draft amendments establishing a new macro-

prudential body and assigning new tasks to the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in connection with 

the preservation of financial stability and the reduction of systemic threats and pro-cyclical risks. 

The institutional set-up of macro-prudential oversight and the respective responsibilities of national 

authorities in an EU Member State are considered to be of general significance to the whole ESCB 

owing to their importance for the stability of the financial system.55 CON/2013/15.56 CON/2013/5.57 CON/2013/9, CON/2013/11 and CON/2013/18.58 In compliance with EU law, and in particular with recital 19 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of 
the euro (OJ L 139, 11.5.1998, p. 1).59 CON/2013/9.60 CON/2013/11.
61 CON/2013/84.62 These include (i) cases where a national authority failed to submit draft legislative provisions within the ECB™s field of competence for 
consultation to the ECB; and (ii) cases where a national authority formally consulted the ECB, but did not afford it sufficient time to 
examine the draft legislative provisions and to adopt its opinion prior to adoption of these provisions.63 The ECB understands ﬁclearﬂ to mean cases where there is no legal doubt that the ECB should have been consulted, and ﬁimportantﬂ to 

mean cases: (i) where, if consultation had properly taken place, the ECB would have made significant critical comments on the substance 
of the legislative proposal, and/or (ii) which are of general significance to the ESCB.115ECBAnnual Report2013The ECB was not consulted by the Cypriot authorities on amendments to the Resolution Law. 
The aim of the amendments was to replace the Central Bank of Cyprus as the single institution 

resolution authority with a three-member resolution authority, comprising the Minister of Finance, 

the Chairperson of the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission and the Central Bank of 

Cyprus. Draft amendments to the Restructuring of Financial Institutions Law, which aimed to lay 

down a two-pronged process for the conversion into equity of subordinated debt issued by credit 
institutions, were submitted to the ECB for consultation, but the draft was voted into law the 

following day. Both cases are considered important, because the ECB would have made significant 

critical comments, had it been consulted, and because the cases are of general significance to 

the ESCB.There were two clear and important cases of non-compliance with the consultation obligation in 
relation to Greece. They concerned amendments aimed at strengthening the governance structure 

and independence of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund and legislation on the special liquidation 

of credit institutions. Although the Greek Ministry of Finance submitted respective draft laws to the 

ECB for consultation, these were enacted shortly afterwards and, in any case, prior to the adoption 

of the related ECB opinions.
64 Both cases qualify as important, since they are of general significance 
to the ESCB owing to their importance for the stability of the financial system. Although the ECB was formally consulted on amendments tabled in the parliamentary procedure 
for the draft new law on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank,
65 the legislation was adopted, including the 
amendments in question, very shortly afterwards. The ECB therefore discontinued the consultation 

procedure and did not issue an opinion. Likewise, the ECB received for consultation a draft law 

amending several legal acts in the area of financial regulation in connection with Law CXXXIX 

on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank facilitating the integration of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory 

Authority (HFSA) into the central bank, as well as later draft amendments. This request was 

followed by another one, namely for an opinion on a new draft decree amending several government 

decrees in connection with the integration of the HFSA into the Magyar Nemzeti Bank. Given that 

the request was also directly connected to the new integrated supervisory structure in Hungary, 

the ECB decided to issue a joint opinion on both consultation requests. The draft law, including 

draft amendments, as well as the draft decree were adopted prior to the adoption by the ECB of its 

opinion on the matter.
66 Both of the non-compliance cases mentioned are of general significance 
to the ESCB because they refer to central bank independence and because the ECB made 

significant critical comments in its opinions in this regard. In addition, the Hungarian authorities 

failed to consult the ECB on legislation defining the rules applicable to a new integrated system 

of cooperative credit institutions and on further easing the burden of foreign exchange mortgage 

holders, which are considered to be of general significance for the ESCB, given that they are 

important for the stability of the financial system.The ECB was not consulted by the Irish authorities on a law for the purpose of allowing the 
immediate liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and safeguarding the position of 

the Central Bank of Ireland. It is understood that the reason for this was the urgent nature of the 
situation and, in particular, the need to enact the legislation before the disclosure of its content to 

prevent its aims being frustrated. The case is considered to be of general significance to the whole 

ESCB.64 See CON/2013/38 and CON/2013/57.65 The ECB adopted Opinion CON/2013/56 on the original draft of the new law on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank in July 2013. The 
amendments to this original draft were substantive in terms of their number and scope, affecting the essence of the legislation beyond an 
accommodation of the observations made in Opinion CON/2013/56.66 CON/2013/71.116ECBAnnual Report
2013The ECB was consulted by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance on a draft decree-law 
providing for a capital increase of the Banca d™Italia and laying down principles for amendments 

to the Statute of the Banca d™Italia. Since the draft decree-law was adopted only a few working 

days later, the national authority did not afford the ECB sufficient time to adopt its opinion.
67 The changes to the capital structure of the Banca d™Italia are of general significance to the ESCB.The Luxembourg authorities failed to consult the ECB on a law on covered bonds amending the 
law on the financial sector. This law has introduced a new category of covered bonds which may be 

issued by credit institutions entitled to issue covered bonds and which are secured by loans granted 

to credit institutions taking part in a ﬁsystem of institutional guaranteeﬂ. The case is considered to 

be of general significance to the ESCB because a new consultative role is assigned to the Banque 

centrale du Luxembourg in the context of the system of institutional guarantee. Moreover, the 

law gave rise to possible confusion with regard to the allocation of minimum reserves to specific 

sections of credit institutions issuing covered bonds, and also raised issues with regard to access to 

central bank funding through monetary policy operations or emergency liquidity assistance in the 

event of a stay of payment or liquidation of an institution issuing such covered bonds.The ECB was formally consulted by the Slovenian authorities on a draft regulation on the 
implementation of measures to strengthen bank stability and on draft amendments to the adopted 

regulation. However, in both cases, the consultation request was sent to the ECB late in the 

legislative procedure, i.e. the draft regulation and subsequent draft amendments were adopted prior 

to the adoption by the ECB of the respective opinions.
68 The cases are considered important from a 
financial stability point of view and because they are of general significance to the ESCB.In addition, the failures to consult the ECB by Greece, Hungary, Italy and Slovenia in 2013 were considered to be clear and repetitive cases.696.3 ADMINISTRATION OF BORROWING AND LENDING OPERATIONSIn line with earlier requests, the ECB continued to administer and/or process several borrowing and 

lending operations in 2013.70The ECB is responsible for the administration of the borrowing and lending operations of the 

EU under the medium-term financial assistance facility, as set out in Decision ECB/2003/14 of 
 7 November 2003.71 Interest payments on 11 loans were processed by the ECB. The total amount of 
outstanding EU lending operations under this facility as at 31
 December 2013 was •11.4 billion, the 
same amount as at 31 December 2012.67 CON/2013/96.68 CON/2013/21 and CON/2013/67.69 Repetitive cases are those where the same Member State fails to consult the ECB at least three times in two consecutive years, with at least 
one case of non-compliance in each year under consideration.70 In this context, it is important to recall that when acting as a fiscal agent for the EU™s medium-term financial assistance facility, the 
European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism (pursuant 

to Article 21.2 of the Statue of the ESCB), the ECB fully complies with the monetary financing prohibition under Article 123 of the 
Treaty. See Section 2.2.5 of Convergence Report, ECB, May 2010, p. 24 and point 9 of the ECB™s opinion of 17 March 2011 on a draft European Council decision amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability 
mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro (OJ C 140, 11.5.2011, p. 8).71 In accordance with Article 141(2) of the Treaty, Articles 17, 21.2, 43.1 and 46.1 of the Statute of the ESCB and Article 9 of Council 

Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002.117ECBAnnual Report2013The ECB is responsible for processing, on behalf of the lenders and the borrower, all payments 
related to the loan facility agreement for Greece.
72 The original six loans were consolidated into a single loan in 2012, and in 2013 the ECB processed interest payments on that loan. The balance 
outstanding as at 31
 December 2013 in respect of the pooled bilateral loans for the benefit of Greece 
was •52.9 billion, the same amount as at 31 December 2012.The ECB is responsible for the administration of the borrowing and lending operations of the EU 
under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM).
73 Interest payments on 18 loans were processed by the ECB in 2013. The total amount of outstanding EU lending operations under 

the EFSM as at 31 December 2013 was •43.8 billion, the same amount as at 31 December 2012.The ECB is responsible for the administration of European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) 
loans to Member States whose currency is the euro.
74 In 2013 the ECB processed 15 disbursement 
payments on behalf of the EFSF and transferred these amounts to the borrower countries (Ireland, 

Portugal and Greece). Interest and fee payments on 17 loans were processed by the ECB.The ECB is responsible for the administration of European Stability Mechanism (ESM) loans 
to Member States whose currency is the euro.
75 In 2013 the ECB processed three disbursement 
payments on behalf of the ESM and transferred these amounts to the borrower country (Cyprus). 6.4 EUROSYSTEM RESERVE MANAGEMENT SERVICESIn 2013 a comprehensive set of services continued to be offered within the framework established 

in 2005 for the management of Eurosystem customers™ euro-denominated reserve assets. The 

complete set of services Œ which is available to central banks, monetary authorities and government 

agencies located outside the euro area, as well as to international organisations Œ is offered under 

harmonised terms and conditions in line with general market standards by individual Eurosystem 

central banks (the Eurosystem service providers). The ECB performs an overall coordinating role, 

ensuring the smooth functioning of the framework. The number of customers maintaining a business 

relationship with the Eurosystem increased slightly, from 299
 in 2012 to 300 in 2013. With regard to 

the services themselves, in the course of 2013 there was a substantial decrease (-32%) in customers™ 
total cash balances (including deposits), whereas securities holdings increased considerably (+9%). In 2013 the ECB completed the work started in 2012 to examine possible ways of further improving 
the general operational efficiency and the range of services offered to customers of the Eurosystem 

Reserve Management Services. The changes came into effect on 1
 July 2013 and offer customers, 
among other things, greater flexibility in managing overnight cash balances. 72 In the context of the loan facility agreement between the Member States whose currency is the euro (other than Greece and Germany) 
and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (acting in the public interest, subject to the instructions of and with the benefit of the guarantee of the 
Federal Republic of Germany) as lenders and the Hellenic Republic as borrower and the Bank of Greece as agent to the borrower, and 

pursuant to Articles 17 and 21.2 of the Statute of the ESCB and Article 2 of Decision ECB/2010/4 of 10 May 2010.73 In accordance with Articles 122(2) and 132(1) of the Treaty, Articles 17 and 21 of the Statute of the ESCB, and Article 8 of Council 

Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 of 11 May 2010.74 In accordance with Articles 17 and 21 of the Statute of the ESCB (in conjunction with Article 3(5) of the EFSF Framework Agreement).
75 In accordance with Articles 17 and 21 of the Statute of the ESCB (in conjunction with Article 5.12.1 of the ESM General Terms for 

Financial Assistance Facility Agreements).Alongside the fitting of the facade panels, further headway was made on the installation of the technical infrastructure and 
fit-out for the offices and the interchange platforms in the atrium. In order to carry out the works on the four interchange 
platforms, the entire atrium was temporarily filled with internal scaffolding.119ECBAnnual Report2013CHAPTER 3ENTRY OF LATVIA INTO 
 THE EURO AREA1 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
 IN LATVIAOn 9 July 2013 the EU Council adopted a decision allowing Latvia to adopt the euro as its 
currency from 1
 January 2014, increasing the number of euro area countries from 17 to 18. The 

Council™s decision was based on the convergence reports published by the ECB and the European 

Commission in June 2013, and followed discussions by the European Council, an opinion of the 

European Parliament, a proposal from the European Commission and a recommendation by the 

Eurogroup. On the same day the Council also adopted a regulation fixing the irrevocable conversion 

rate between the Latvian lats and the euro. This conversion rate was set at LVL 0.702804 to the 

euro, which was equal to the central rate of the Latvian lats throughout Latvia™s membership of the 

exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II).Over the last 15 years the process of convergence towards a market economy and better living 
standards in Latvia has been accompanied by large swings in economic activity. In the early 2000s 

Latvia was one of Europe™s fastest-growing economies, alongside Estonia and Lithuania. The 

accession to the EU in 2004 provided further stimulus to growth, thanks to enhanced trade and 

financial integration with the EU. A rapid sectoral transformation towards a more services-oriented 

economy took place. By 2006 and 2007 real GDP was growing at an annual rate of 10%, unit 

labour costs were increasing at almost twice that speed and the current account deficit had reached 

20% of GDP (see Table 14). The financial crisis that hit the world in 2008 intensified the adjustment of the Latvian economy 
after the overheating in previous years. Following the rescue of a private bank, Latvia requested 

financial assistance from the EU and the IMF in the autumn of 2008. Over the subsequent two years 

Latvia™s output shrank by 20%, the unemployment rate rose to around 20%, and the current account 

deficit turned into a surplus owing mainly to the collapse in domestic demand. A frontloaded and credible fiscal consolidation strategy, as well as structural reforms, laid the 
ground for a sustainable recovery. Devaluation fears in the markets receded and the country 

managed to stick to its fixed exchange rate against the euro. Economic growth turned positive, on a 
quarterly basis, towards the end of 2009. Significant downward adjustment in wages helped Latvia 

regain competitiveness and exports rebounded in the middle of 2009. Benefiting from strengthening 

world demand after the global recession, Latvia™s share of world exports has been increasing since 

2011. As a result, the trade deficit stood at 2.2% of GDP in the year up to the third quarter of 2013.The EU-IMF financial assistance programme was successfully completed in January 2012. The 
loan from the IMF was fully repaid by the end of 2012, ahead of schedule. By the third quarter of 
2013 Latvia had recovered almost half of the real GDP lost during the crisis. Inflation developments in Latvia over the past decade have been very volatile. Following a 
downward trend between the mid-1990s and 2003, HICP inflation picked up noticeably in 2004, 

fluctuated between 6% and 7% until 2006, and peaked at 17.5% in the second quarter of 2008, 

reflecting demand pressures, the harmonisation of the indirect tax legislation with the rest of the 

EU, as well as increases in administered prices and global commodity prices. As the economy 
120ECBAnnual Report
2013entered a recession, inflation slowed significantly, partly affected by the downward adjustment 
of wages. With world food and energy prices rising and indirect taxes increasing (as one of the 

consolidation measures), inflation started to rise again towards the end of 2010. Over the last two 

years inflation developments have been more benign, however, partly reflecting the fading impact 

of past increases in global commodity prices, slower increases in administered prices and cuts in 

indirect tax rates. Owing to stable wage growth and an improvement in productivity, domestic cost 

pressures have also remained low. Owing to a quite flexible labour market, the unemployment rate has declined markedly from the 
high levels reached during the crisis. Compared with the peak of 20.8% in the first quarter of 

2010, the unemployment rate reached 12.1% in the third quarter of 2013. Over the last five years 

a large number of workers have emigrated to other EU countries and the labour force has shrunk 

significantly. However, the last couple of years have seen decreasing emigration, which suggests a 

stabilising outlook for labour force dynamics. At the same time, regional differences in employment 

and unemployment, as well as skill mismatches, persist. A tight labour market and a high natural 

rate of unemployment may create upward wage pressure and reduce Latvia™s growth potential in 

the future. Therefore, further policies to improve the functioning of the labour market are crucial.Pro-cyclical fiscal policies were observed during the boom period before the crisis. Over the 
period from 2000 to 2007 the headline deficit remained below 3% of GDP, but at the same time 

the underlying structural fiscal position deteriorated, a development masked by buoyant economic 

growth. According to European Commission estimates, fiscal policy was strongly expansionary

3) Latvian lats per euro.121ECBAnnual Report2013from 2005 to 2008 and revenue windfalls were used for additional spending instead of more rapid 
deficit reduction. When economic activity abruptly contracted in 2008, government revenues 

collapsed and the fiscal deficit increased, exceeding 4% of GDP in 2008 and reaching almost 

10% of GDP in 2009 (see Table 14). In summer 2009 the ECOFIN Council decided to open an 

excessive deficit procedure for Latvia and set a deadline for correction by 2012. The magnitude of 

consolidation undertaken by Latvia under the supervision of the EU and the IMF was extraordinary. 

The level of nominal government consumption and investment declined by almost one-third in 

2010 compared with 2008. On the expenditure side, consolidation primarily consisted of significant 

cuts in compensation of public employees and in intermediate consumption. On the revenue side, 

it consisted of increases in VAT rates and in the taxation of personal income and property, together 

with a broadening of the social security contribution base. In 2009
 and 2010 capital injections into 

the ailing banking sector caused further strain on public finances. Nevertheless, the consolidation 

effort was successful in reducing the deficit-to-GDP ratio from 9.8% in 2009 to 1.3% in 2012. 

Government debt dynamics were relatively contained up to 2007; after that, the government debt 

quickly increased and peaked at 44.4% of GDP in 2010. The latest developments in Latvia as regards the strengthening of fiscal governance have been 
positive. Latvia is a signatory of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the 

Economic and Monetary Union, which entered into force in January 2013. In this context, the 

national fiscal framework was strengthened with the adoption of the Fiscal Discipline Law, which 

envisages a balanced budget over the economic cycle and from a medium-term perspective, as 

well as the creation of a Fiscal Council. According to the European Commission™s autumn 2013 

forecast, the government deficit-to-GDP ratio in Latvia is expected to remain contained, at around 

1% in 2014, and the government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain broadly unchanged at 

39% in 2014. Monetary policy has played an important role in shaping Latvia™s convergence process over the 
past decade. The aim of Latvijas Banka has for a long time been price stability, enshrined in its law 

as of 1992. To achieve this aim, Latvijas Banka maintained a fixed exchange rate regime, while 

allowing for the free movement of capital. As of 1994 the Latvian lats was pegged to the special 

drawing rights (SDRs). After joining the EU in 2004, Latvia was expected to join Monetary Union 

as soon as sustainable convergence had been achieved. In view of its ERM II membership, Latvia 

pegged its currency to the euro on 30 December 2004 at the rate of LVL 0.702804. In May 2005 
the country joined ERM II, unilaterally defining a fluctuation band of ±1% around the central parity 

rate equivalent to the rate fixed in December 2004. When the initial signs of overheating emerged 

in 2004, Latvijas Banka started to tighten monetary policy to mitigate the expansion of credit. 
 This action, however, was not sufficient to prevent the build-up of excessive imbalances and the 

boom-bust cycle, in particular in the housing market. Once the adjustment started, Latvijas Banka 

started to loosen monetary policy. Following gradual reductions over the last few years, Latvijas 

Banka further reduced its refinancing rate to 0.25% in November 2013 to ensure a smooth transition 
to the ECB™s monetary policy as of 1 January 2014. The Latvian banking system is fairly small
 (as a share of GDP) in comparison with most other 
EU countries. However, several predominantly domestically owned banks rely on non-resident 

deposits as a source of funding. While domestic lending activity by these banks is rather limited, 

their holdings of non-resident deposits accounted for almost half of the total deposit base in the 
second half of 2013. High reliance on non-resident deposits implies risks to financial stability and 

creates contingent liabilities for the government. A business model based on non-resident financial 
122ECBAnnual Report
2013services may intensify a number of other risks, such as credit, concentration, liquidity, market and 
recapitalisation risk. To address potential risks, the Latvian authorities have adopted additional, 

much stricter, prudential requirements for banks with such a business model (additional capital 

and liquidity requirements within the Pillar 2 framework, as well as enhanced off-site and on-site 

inspections). The Latvian authorities should continue monitoring developments in this area and 

should implement a comprehensive policy toolkit of micro- and macro-prudential policies and 

enhance this toolkit, if necessary, in order to limit these risks. In order to fully reap the advantages of the euro and to allow adjustment mechanisms to operate 
efficiently within the enlarged currency area, Latvia needs to maintain its reform efforts. It should 

conduct economic policies that are geared towards ensuring the sustainability of the convergence 

process and sustainable growth in the long term. Ensuring a low-inflation environment Œ in 

particular, keeping wage growth in line with productivity developments Œ is crucial in that respect. 

In addition, the functioning of the labour market should be improved to reach its full potential. It 

is imperative that policy areas other than monetary policy provide the Latvian economy with the 

ability to cope with potential country-specific shocks and avoid the reoccurrence of macroeconomic 

imbalances. The Latvian authorities have publicly underlined their key goal to avoid pro-cyclical 

policies and strengthen the quality of institutions, the business environment and governance to 

ensure the stability and competitiveness of the economy. In addition, the authorities have announced 

a commitment to full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal compact on a 

permanent basis, further structural reforms and further strengthening of financial sector policies. 

The fulfilment of and long-term adherence to these commitments is essential to ensure that the 

economic environment is conducive to sustainable output and employment growth in the medium 

and long term, in the context of balanced macroeconomic conditions and price stability.Box 8STATISTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EURO AREA TO INCLUDE LATVIALatvia™s entry into the euro area on 1 January 2014 has an impact on the compilation of statistics 

in Latvia as well as in the other euro area countries. This is the sixth time that statistical series for 

the euro area have had to be amended to include additional member countries. The preparation 

of statistics for the enlarged euro area has been coordinated, where necessary, with the European 

Commission. The entry of Latvia into the euro area means that Latvian residents, including legal 

entities, have become residents of the euro area. This affects statistics recording transactions 

(flows) and positions of euro area residents among themselves and vis-à-vis non-euro area 

residents, such as monetary, balance of payments and international investment position statistics, 

as well as financial accounts. In these cases, transactions and positions between residents 
 of Latvia and other euro area residents must now be ﬁconsolidatedﬂ to ensure a proper definition 

of euro area residency in all statistics concerned.As of January 2014 Latvia has to meet all the statistical requirements of the ECB, i.e. to provide 
fully harmonised and comparable national data.
1 Since the preparatory work for new statistics requires a long lead time, Latvijas Banka and the ECB started the statistical preparations 

before Latvia joined the EU. After becoming a member of the ESCB in 2004, Latvijas Banka

LATVIJAS BANKA INTO THE EUROSYSTEMPursuant to Article 140 of the Treaty, the ECB reviewed the statute of Latvijas Banka and other relevant Latvian legislation for compliance with Article 131 of the Treaty. The ECB made 
 a favourable assessment of the compatibility of Latvian legislation with the Treaty and with the 

Statute of the ESCB.1The ECB and Latvijas Banka put in place a number of legal instruments with a view to ensuring 

the integration of Latvijas Banka into the Eurosystem on 1
 January 2014. The Eurosystem™s 
legal framework was adapted as a consequence of the decision taken by the ECOFIN Council on 

9 July 2013 to abrogate the derogation of Latvia.

27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Governing Council adopted a recommendation on Latvijas 

Banka™s external auditors for the annual accounts starting from the financial year 2014.
5 The ECB also reviewed its legal framework and introduced, where necessary, amendments resulting from 

Latvijas Banka™s membership of the Eurosystem. This included a review of Latvian legislation

financial statistics, financial stability statistics, securities holdings statistics, external statistics, 

government finance statistics and financial accounts. It also had to prepare for the integration 

of Latvian credit institutions into the ECB™s minimum reserve system and to fulfil the relevant 

statistical requirements in this area. Moreover, it had to carry out the necessary preparations to 

meet the statistical needs of the European Systemic Risk Board and to support the information 

needs of the new Single Supervisory Mechanism.For the data reporters and NCBs of the other euro area countries, the enlargement of the euro area 
means that since January 2014 they have had to report transactions and positions with residents 

of Latvia as part of euro area data, instead of as non-euro area data.In addition, Latvia and all other euro area countries provided backdata with sufficient 
geographical and sectoral detail, dating back as far as 2004, the year Latvia joined the EU. These 

historical data will enable the compilation of aggregates for the euro area in its new composition 

for some years before euro area enlargement.Regarding the publication of euro area statistics, the ECB has granted users online access 
 to different sets of time series, some of which contain data for the current euro area (i.e. including 
Latvia) as far back as available, and some of which link the various compositions of the euro

minimum reserves by the ECB following the introduction of the euro in Latvia.
6 Finally, the ERM 
II Agreement 7 was terminated for Latvijas Banka.The introduction of the euro in Latvia and the integration of its central bank into the Eurosystem 

also required changes to some Latvian legal instruments. The ECB was consulted on national 

legislation governing the euro changeover and the minimum reserves framework.8The ECOFIN Council consulted the ECB on its proposals to amend the Council Regulations
 9 which enabled the introduction of the euro in Latvia and determined the irrevocably fixed exchange rate 

of the euro vis-à-vis the Latvian lats.
10 The ECB welcomed the proposed regulations and noted that 
they would enable the introduction of the euro as the currency of Latvia following the abrogation of 

Latvia™s derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 140(2) of the Treaty.3 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE INTEGRATION 
 OF LATVIJAS BANKA INTO THE EUROSYSTEMFollowing the Decision of the EU Council of 9 July 2013 on the adoption of the euro by Latvia on 

1 January 2014, the ECB conducted technical preparations with a view to fully integrating Latvijas 

Banka into the Eurosystem. In line with the provisions of the Treaty, Latvijas Banka joined the 

Eurosystem with exactly the same rights and obligations as the NCBs of the EU Member States that 

had already adopted the euro.The technical preparations for the integration of Latvijas Banka into the Eurosystem covered a wide 
range of areas, notably financial reporting and accounting, monetary policy operations, foreign 

reserve management and foreign exchange operations, payment systems, statistics and banknote 

production. In the field of operations, preparations involved extensive testing of the instruments, 

procedures and technical systems for the implementation of monetary policy and foreign exchange 

operations.MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONSFollowing the adoption of the euro by Latvia on 1 January 2014, 61 Latvian credit institutions, 

a list of which is published on the ECB™s website, became subject to the Eurosystem™s reserve 

requirements as from that date. The entry of Latvia into the euro area changed the liquidity 

conditions in the Eurosystem only slightly. The aggregate reserve requirements of euro area credit 
institutions increased by less than 0.2% (•187 million). Net autonomous liquidity factors in Latvia

 of the entire euro area banking sector by 0.1% (•0.5 billion) on average.CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECB™S CAPITAL AND FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETSLatvijas Banka™s total subscribed share in the ECB™s capital amounts to •30.5 million, equivalent to 
0.2821% of the ECB™s subscribed capital of •10.825 billion as at 1 January 2014. Upon joining the 

ESCB on 1 May 2004, Latvijas Banka paid up 7% of its share of the subscribed capital of the ECB 

as a contribution to the ECB™s operational costs; in conjunction with the ECB™s capital increase 

on 29 December 2010 this contribution was reduced to 3.75%. In accordance with Article 48.1 
 of the Statute of the ESCB, Latvijas Banka paid up the remaining part of its subscription, equal to 

•29.4 million, on 1 January 2014.With effect from 1 January 2014, and in accordance with Articles 30 and 48.1 of the  Statute of the ESCB, Latvijas Banka, on the basis of its share of the ECB™s subscribed capital, 
transferred to the ECB foreign reserve assets with a total value equivalent to •163.5 million 
 (85% in Japanese yen-denominated assets and 15% in gold). Latvijas Banka has opted to conduct 

the operational activities related to the management of its share of the ECB™s Japanese yen 

reserve assets in a pooled management arrangement with the Oesterreichische Nationalbank. As 

a result of the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB, Latvijas Banka was credited with a 
 euro-denominated claim on the ECB in accordance with Article 30.3 of the Statute of the ESCB.4 THE CASH CHANGEOVER IN LATVIATHE LOGISTICS OF THE CASH CHANGEOVEROn 1 January 2014 Latvia adopted the euro as its currency. The cash changeover went smoothly 

and, following a two-week period during which Latvian lats and euro cash circulated in parallel, 

the euro banknotes and coins became the sole legal tender in Latvia. Virtually all automated teller 

machines (ATMs) dispensed only euro banknotes as of 1 January 2014. The cash changeover 

modalities had been laid down in a changeover plan established jointly with stakeholders.The Deutsche Bundesbank, which acted as the logistical counterpart, provided 110.3 million 
banknotes worth •3.12 billion. Latvijas Banka will repay that loan in the form of banknotes 
 in 2015. The banknotes of the first series to be commissioned by Latvijas Banka will carry the letter 

ﬁCﬂ in their serial numbers. Latvijas Banka procured 400 million euro coins worth •98.8 million 

from the Staatliche Münzen Baden-Württemberg.In terms of value, 8.0% of the borrowed euro banknotes and nearly 40.0% of the procured euro coins were distributed to banks before the changeover date so that they could fill ATMs and provide 

retailers and other professional cash handlers with euro cash. In addition, about 700,000 starter kits, 

each containing euro coins with a value of •14.23, were distributed to the general public in order to 

reduce the amount of change to be kept by retailers in the first few days of January.In connection with the introduction of the euro in Latvia, NCBs exchanged, free of charge, Latvian 
lats for euro at par value from the first working day of 2014 until 28 February 2014.11 The amount exchanged was limited to •1,000 for any given party and transaction on any one day. 11 Article 49 of the Statute of the ESCB requires that the Governing Council of the ECB take the necessary measures to ensure that 
banknotes denominated in currencies with irrevocably fixed exchange rates to the euro are exchanged by the euro area NCBs at par value. 
 Against this background, the Governing Council adopted a guideline on the exchange of such banknotes on 24 July 2006.126ECBAnnual Report
2013From 1 January 2014, for a period of six months, lats could be exchanged for euro at the fixed 
exchange rate free of charge at all bank branches providing cash services. Latvian post offices 

offered the same service until the end of March 2014. Latvijas Banka will continue to redeem Latvian lats banknotes and coins for an unlimited period 
 of time.THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EUROThe ECB worked closely with Latvijas Banka to prepare a comprehensive information campaign 
in preparation for the introduction of the euro. The communication tools used in the campaign 

took into account the experience gained in past changeovers and included a mass media campaign 

involving two television commercials and print, outdoor and online advertising, public opinion 

surveys, different types of printed publication and dedicated internet pages. The euro information 

campaign organised by the ECB and Latvijas Banka aimed to familiarise the general public and 

cash handlers with the visual appearance and security features of the euro banknotes and coins,  as well as with key facts and dates related to the cash changeover. Communication partners 
 (mainly banks and public authorities) were given access to electronic material produced by the 

ECB, which they were able to adapt and use in their own communication activities.As in previous changeovers, the ECB developed a ﬁtalking cardﬂ for the visually impaired (with 
an embedded MP3 file that reads out basic information requested on the changeover and the euro 

cash).In addition to the measures targeted at the general public, a high-level conference aimed 
 at representatives of government, civil society and the media was held on 12 September 2013 with 
the participation of the President of the ECB, the Governor of Latvijas Banka, the Prime Minister 

and Finance Minister of Latvia and the Vice-President of the European Commission. The main principle of an English garden, i.e. that it should be in harmony with the surrounding landscape and present 
an idealised view of nature, formed the basis of the landscape concept for the new ECB premises developed by the 
Swiss company Vogt Landscape Architects. The idea is that of abstracting the typical terrain of natural flood plains. 
The continuous landscape design incorporates the Grossmarkthalle and the new high-rise, as well as essential functional 

equipment and structures, without losing its quality as a park and its landscape identity. It will also include over 700 trees 
of around 25 different types.129ECBAnnual Report2013CHAPTER˜4FINANCIAL STABILITY, 
 TASKS RELATED TO THE ESRB, AND FINANCIAL INTEGRATION1 FINANCIAL STABILITYThe Eurosystem contributes to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent national 
authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial 

system. The ECB provides advice to the European Commission on the scope and implementation 

of EU legislation in the fields of prudential supervision and financial stability. Furthermore, the 

ECB provides administrative, analytical, statistical and logistical support to the European Systemic 

Risk Board (ESRB). From November 2014 onwards, the ECB will be responsible for the prudential 

supervision of the major banking groups in the euro area and will have important macro-prudential 

responsibilities. In this context, the ECB will make a major contribution to the financial stability of 

the euro area.1.1 FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORINGTHE EURO AREA BANKING SECTORAs part of its mandate, the ECB regularly monitors risks to financial stability and assesses the 

shock-absorbing capacity of the euro area financial system, in close collaboration with the ESCB™s 

Financial Stability Committee.
1 Much of the focus of this important task is on banks, as they 
remain the primary financial intermediaries in the euro area. This notwithstanding, other financial 

institutions such as insurance corporations are also monitored closely. The related monitoring 

necessarily extends to non-financial sectors of the economy, which interact closely with the banking 

sector in its intermediation role. Moreover, owing to the importance of financial markets, financial 

infrastructures and other financial institutions, and their linkages with banks, vulnerabilities in these 

components of the financial system are also monitored by the ESCB. Analytical tools and models 

have been developed to assist in the performance of risk surveillance and risk assessment tasks, 

notably early warning signal models and macro-stress-testing tools to assess the overall resilience 

of the banking sector.2Euro area financial sector stress remained moderate in
 2013, despite some global financial market 

turbulence in the summer months mainly related to changes in expectations regarding the monetary 

policy stance in the United States. The developments in the euro area reflected continued adjustment 

in euro area countries, aimed at strengthening fiscal positions and addressing structural rigidities 

restraining economic growth. At the same time, advances made on the regulatory front contributed 
to building up higher capital and liquidity buffers in the banking sector, enhancing the banking

, No 152, ECB, October 2013. 130ECBAnnual Report
2013The financial performance of potentially significant banking groups
 3 in the euro area remained subdued in the first three quarters of
 2013, hampered by still elevated loan loss provisioning charges 
and sluggish revenue growth. Euro area banks™ net interest income continued to face headwinds 
from weak or negative lending growth as well as low interest rates. Fee, commission and trading 
income increased modestly as a percentage of total assets over the year. The cost-to-income ratios 

of significant banking groups declined in the first half of
 2013, but increased again in the third 

quarter. The elevated loan loss provisioning appears to be closely linked to the economic cycle and 

was particularly pronounced for banks in stressed countries.Despite relatively weak profitability, euro area banks have continued to steadily strengthen their 
capital positions. These improvements by euro area banks have been achieved through a combination 

of capital increases and reductions in risk-weighted assets, with the relative contribution of these 

two factors varying greatly across the significant banking groups.Conditions in bank funding markets improved, but fragmentation nonetheless remains. Euro area 
banks™ issuance of both senior unsecured and covered bonds remained below
 2012 levels, even 
though average bank funding costs reached their lowest level for more than three years across 

all major debt instruments in early October. Smaller banks in stressed countries continued to pay 
higher spreads on their newly issued senior unsecured debt than their larger counterparts, whereas 

the difference in the spread between large and smaller banks in non-stressed countries was less 

marked. At the same time, the issuance of subordinated debt, in particular by large banks, picked up 

considerably, albeit from low levels. On the basis of survey data, 4 price and non-price credit terms for wholesale counterparties remained unchanged after some improvement in the first half of
 2013. Furthermore, banks™ funding situation benefited from continued deposit inflows in most countries, 

including some reversal of the fragmentation that had previously exerted a negative effect on 

deposits in some countries under stress. Moreover, banks in most stressed countries continued to 

reduce their dependence on central bank funding by repaying funds borrowed through the three-

year longer-term refinancing operations, although repayment rates varied across banking sectors.OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONSThe reported profitability of large euro area insurers has so far been little affected by the financial 

and economic crisis or the prevailing low-yield environment, being on average roughly double that 

of the large and complex banking groups. Solid investment income and underwriting performance 

supported returns on equity. The observed resilience of these insurers appears to be linked to the 

extent of diversification that large insurers display, on the one hand, and to the long-term nature of 

insurance business, where assets are generally held to maturity and investment income is therefore 

less vulnerable to market volatility, on the other. However, profitability was dented by insured 

losses over the last months of 2013, mostly stemming from floods in central and eastern Europe. 

Investment income continued to be resilient to the low yields on highly rated government bonds, 

which constitute the lion™s share of many euro area insurers™ investment portfolios. Volatility in 

global debt markets through the summer had a stronger impact on the reported capital positions of 

large euro area insurers than on their profitability, demonstrating their vulnerability to the risk of a 

sudden increase in yields through its impact on asset valuations and therefore solvency.3 This concept refers to the approximately 130 banking entities (including around 90 parent and stand-alone banks) that are currently 
estimated to fall under the direct supervision of the ECB as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).4 ﬁThe survey on credit terms and conditions on euro-denominated securities financing and OTC derivatives marketsﬂ was launched by the 
ECB in 2013 and is conducted at a quarterly frequency.131ECBAnnual Report20131.2 FINANCIAL STABILITY ARRANGEMENTSImportant progress was made in the development of financial stability arrangements for the EU 
during 2013. In June 2012 the European Commission issued a legislative proposal that aims to establish a 
harmonised EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of banks.
5 The framework, which 
was broadly welcomed by the ECB in its opinion
 6, equips authorities with the powers and tools to 
inter alia manage bank failures, while keeping critical bank functions operational, protecting public 

finances, safeguarding financial stability and involving shareholders and creditors appropriately. 

In 2013 the ECB welcomed that the Council agreed on a compromise text in June.7 Since then, the ﬁtrialogueﬂ negotiations between the European Parliament, the European Commission and 

the Council have been completed and an agreement between the co-legislators was reached 

on 12 December. The forthcoming recovery and resolution framework will be a key element of banking union. In 
July 2013 the European Commission presented a legislative proposal
 8 for a Single Resolution 
Mechanism (SRM), which foresees a single European authority and fund for bank resolution for 

all EU Member States that participate in banking union. The Council agreed on a general approach 

regarding the SRM at the ECOFIN meeting on
 18 December 2013, while the European Parliament™s 
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted its negotiation position on
 17 December. 
Trialogue negotiations are now under way, with adoption expected in the current legislative period.
In its opinion 9 on the proposed SRM regulation, the ECB fully supported the establishment of an 
SRM, which will contribute to strengthening the architecture and stability of EMU. The SRM is 
a necessary complement to the SSM. Such a mechanism therefore needs to be established by the 

time the ECB assumes its supervisory responsibility in full. Therefore, the ECB strongly supported 

the envisaged timeline for the SRM. Furthermore, the proposed regulation contains three essential 

elements for effective resolution, namely (i) a single European system, which encompasses all 

Member States participating in the SSM, (ii) a single European authority at the centre of the SRM, 

with sufficient decision-making authority to take resolution action in the interest of stability within 

the euro area and of the EU as a whole and (iii) a single European fund, which is financed by 
ex ante risk-based contributions from all banks subject to the SRM and complemented by ex post 

contributions where necessary.The ECB considered that the SRM™s decision-making capacity and voting modalities must ensure 
timely and efficient decision-making. Furthermore, the tasks and responsibilities of the authorities 

involved in the resolution process should be precisely defined. Regarding the assessment of 

conditions triggering resolution, the ECB considered that the supervisory authority Œ namely the 

ECB or the relevant national supervisory authority Œ should be allocated sole responsibility for 

assessing whether the criteria have been met. Moreover, the ECB called for the bail-in tool to 

be implemented earlier than
 2018 and for a joint and solid public backstop to be available upon 
5 Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit 
institutions and investment firms (COM (2012) 280 final).6 CON/2012/99. For further details on this opinion and other ECB opinions, see the ECB™s website.
7 For example, in the ECB President™s remarks at the hearing of the European Parliament™s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs 
on 8 July.8 Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the 

resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution 
Fund and amending Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM (2013) 520).9 CON/2013/76.132ECBAnnual Report
2013the entry into force of the proposed regulation. Finally, regarding the composition of the single 
resolution board, the ECB recommended that the ECB should have an open invitation to observe in 

all meetings of the board in order to maintain the separation of institutional responsibilities between 

the supervisory and resolution functions.A robust SRM is needed and it is expected that the co-legislators will achieve agreement on this 
in the trialogue process. The ECB considered that the Council™s general approach will need to 

be amended in order for the governance framework to facilitate the fast and effective action that 

is required for effective bank resolution. An agreement is also necessary to establish access to a 

temporary joint public backstop to the SRM. This could take the form of a credit line to the single 

resolution fund, and should it be activated the credit extended would be fully recouped from the 

private sector. The forthcoming framework for the SRM should provide for close coordination 

between the SRM™s resolution function and the SSM™s supervisory function, while adhering to and 

respecting the respective institutional responsibilities. Both the SSM and the SRM are essential 

parts of the integrated financial framework of banking union, which will help to break the link 

between banks and sovereigns in the Member States concerned and reverse the current process of 

financial market fragmentation.In the course of 2013 the ECB continued to support the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in its work 
to address the negative externalities related to systemic institutions and to address the ﬁtoo big to 

failﬂ problem. In July
 2013 the FSB issued additional guidance on effective resolution strategies, 

stress scenarios and recovery triggers, as well as on the identification of critical functions. This 

guidance assists authorities in developing and implementing the FSB recovery and resolution 

requirements. The ECB will support the FSB in the further policy development identified following 

the St Petersburg G20 summit in September
 2013, in particular regarding the development of a 
proposal on gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity for global systemically important financial 

institutions for the Brisbane G20 summit in November 2014.Moreover, in the context of the higher loss-absorbency requirements for global systemically 
important banks, the ECB continued to support the Basel Committee™s work to further refine the 

assessment methodology. An updated framework including these refinements as well as reporting 

guidance was published in July 2013.Finally, during 2013 the ECB also issued several other opinions related to financial stability 
arrangements.101.3 PROGRESS TOWARDS ESTABLISHING THE SINGLE SUPERVISORY MECHANISMThe Council Regulation establishing a Single Supervisory Mechanism (ﬁSSM Regulationﬂ)
11 was adopted by the EU Council on 15
 October 2013 and entered into force on 3 November 2013. 
In accordance with this Regulation, the ECB will assume new supervisory responsibilities on 

4 November 2014, with the objective of protecting the safety and soundness of credit institutions 

and the stability of the financial system in Europe.10 See, for example, CON/2013/2, CON/2013/3, CON/2013/21 and CON/2013/50, among others.
11 Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies 
relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions.133ECBAnnual Report2013Following the entry into force of the Regulation, the Governing Council of the ECB proposed 
Danièle Nouy for the position of Chair of the Supervisory Board of the SSM. After the European 

Parliament had approved the Governing Council™s proposal, the ECOFIN Council adopted the 

implementing decision in December. Sabine Lautenschläger was appointed Vice-Chair of the 

Supervisory Board in February 2014. The preparatory work for the establishment of the SSM was launched during the summer of 2012 
and was steered by a High-Level Group chaired by the President of the ECB. At the technical 

level, a Task Force on Supervision conducted the preparatory work. Both of these groups included 

representatives from each national competent authority (NCA). A project team, composed of 

managers from the supervisory and financial stability areas of the ECB and some of the national 

authorities, has also been created to foster communication and cooperation on specific issues. The ECB also set up a structure to ensure the coordination of the preparatory work taking place 
internally. The Internal Group on Supervision is monitoring the ECB-wide master plan related to 

the SSM, and a dedicated human resources team has been established to support the preparatory 

work and the SSM-related recruitment process. The technical work under the aegis of the Task Force on Supervision was organised in five work 
streams and conducted by representatives from both the ECB and the NCAs. The first work stream 

conducted a mapping of the euro area banking system, in the form of a catalogue comprising 

all supervised entities falling within the scope of the SSM, with details of the internal structure 

and composition of all euro area banking groups. The analytical work was supported by a newly 

developed reference database (see Section 4 of Chapter 2), and the data collected served as a basis 

for the ECB™s selection of the institutions subject to the SSM comprehensive assessment.
12 The data are also being used in the classification of supervised entities as potentially significant or less 

significant banks prior to the start of SSM operations. The second work stream, conducted by a group of legal experts from the ECB and the NCAs, 
developed a draft framework regulation which will govern the practical arrangements for 

implementing Article 6 of the SSM Regulation, and in particular the methodology for 
 assessing the significance of credit institutions. The draft framework regulation also defines the 

procedures for cooperation between the ECB and the NCAs within the SSM. This work stream also 

covered the legal preparations for a public consultation on the draft regulation, which was launched 

in February 2014, and the provision of legal advice on various other legal acts of relevance for 

the development of the legal and institutional framework of the SSM (regarding administrative 

penalties, for example), as well as on various banking and supervisory legal matters of direct 

relevance to the SSM.The third work stream focused on developing the supervisory model of the SSM, including all 
processes, procedures and the methodology for banking supervision. The processes under 

consideration aim to ensure harmonised and high-quality supervision for all credit institutions 

covered by the SSM. A risk assessment system was also developed, covering the scope and 
key principles of the risk assessment, the methodology, the data input and the back-testing. The 

methodology is based on a combination of quantitative indicators and qualitative inputs and is 

designed to apply to all banks that are supervised by the SSM. A further methodology was designed 

for the supervisory review and evaluation process to quantify capital and liquidity needs. This work 

stream also focused on the cooperation between the ECB and the NCAs within the SSM through the 
12 Note Œ comprehensive assessment,
 ECB, October 2013 (available on the ECB™s website).
134ECBAnnual Report
2013definition of processes and procedures for supervision. The day-to-day supervision of significant 
institutions will be conducted by joint supervisory teams led by the ECB and consisting of both 
ECB and NCA experts. An approach for on-site inspections has also been developed. The fourth work stream reviewed the existing supervisory reporting models, with a specific focus 
on the granularity of information, the frequency of data and delivery lags, the coverage in terms 

of institutions, and the level of consolidation (i.e. group or individual level) of the available 

information. The availability of granular credit data for supervision was explored in cooperation 

with the statistics departments of the ECB and the NCAs. A particular focus was placed on the 

different accounting rules applicable in the various euro area jurisdictions. In the course of the year 

supervisory data to be used for the risk assessment system were collected in two pilot exercises. The purpose of the fifth work stream was to propose a methodology to be used in the asset 
quality review, one of the three elements of the comprehensive assessment required by the SSM 

Regulation. The comprehensive assessment, to be conducted at least with respect to significant 

banks, comprises three complementary pillars: (i) a supervisory risk assessment, addressing key 

risks in banks™ balance sheets, including liquidity, leverage and funding; (ii) the above-mentioned 

asset quality review, examining the assets side of bank balance sheets as at 31
 December 2013; and (iii) a stress test, building on and complementing the asset quality review by providing a forward-

looking view of banks™ shock-absorption capacity under stress. When the comprehensive assessment began in November 2013, a dedicated governance structure 
was established, at both the central and the national level, to ensure an efficient and rapid governance 

and decision-making process. The central structure is composed of a Comprehensive Assessment 

Steering Committee (chaired by the ECB and comprising four ECB representatives and eight high-

level NCA representatives), which reports to the Supervisory Board; a Central Project Management 

Office located at the ECB; quality assurance and technical assistance country teams; and a stress-

test team. Governance of the project at the national level consists of four main layers: a steering 

committee, a project management office, inspection teams with the responsibility for conducting 

balance sheet assessments, and a quality assurance and technical assistance team. The ECB has 

appointed Oliver Wyman to support the preparation and implementation of the comprehensive 

assessment of the significant banks that will be directly supervised by the ECB. Oliver Wyman will 

support the ECB™s management and coordination and will provide financial advisory services for 

this project, notably in refining the methodology for the assessment. The Governing Council retains 

the ultimate responsibility for the comprehensive assessment.Work in 2014 will cover areas such as human resources; the fee framework; the IT infrastructure of the SSM; data collection, quality management and analysis; and information management. In 

addition, the SSM governance and legal frameworks have been completed, while work is under 

way to ensure that sufficient office space is available. Various initiatives to provide the public 

with SSM-related information are ongoing. To enable the ECB to perform its new supervisory 

function, four new directorates general and a secretariat unit are in the process of being established. 

Recruitment for these business areas will be ongoing over the course of 2014. Good progress has been made so far in the preparations for the SSM, and the ECB is on schedule to 
take up its new tasks in November 2014. 135ECBAnnual Report20132 TASKS CONCERNING THE FUNCTIONING  OF THE EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD2.1 I
NSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKThe European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of 
the EU financial system and thus contributes to the prevention and mitigation of systemic risks to 

financial stability. It brings together representatives of the ECB, the NCBs and national supervisory 

authorities (NSAs) of the EU Member States, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), the 

European Commission and the Economic and Financial Committee. These bodies are represented 

on the General Board and in some of the sub-structures of the ESRB.The ESRB Secretariat is responsible for the day-to-day business of the ESRB. To this end, with
  28 staff, it receives analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support from the ECB. In 
addition, member institutions of the ESRB provide staff for secondment to ESRB strands of work. 

Cooperation with other EU institutions and the ESAs is an integral part of the ESRB™s activities.The ESRB identifies and monitors systemic risk throughout the EU financial system as a whole, 
analysing both cyclical threats and structural vulnerabilities. It focuses, in particular, on the linkages 

between deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and fragilities in the financial system. Specific 

areas include the relationship between sovereigns and the financial sector, interconnectedness and 

contagion risk (i.e. via interbank networks and counterparty risk as proxied by credit default swaps), 

sectoral exposures, shadow banking, securities financing transactions and infrastructures.In 2013 the main focus of the ESRB™s work was on macro-prudential instruments, creating a 
macro-prudential framework of objectives, tools and indicators. The main strands of work covered 
liquidity, real estate, and systemic and counter-cyclical buffers. On
 15 June 2013 the ESRB 
published its Recommendation on intermediate objectives and instruments of macro-prudential 

policy (ESRB/2013/1) 13. This Recommendation provided an indicative list of macro-prudential 
instruments to be applied by the Member States. During the year the ESRB finalised the assessment of the implementation of its Recommendation 
on lending in foreign currencies (ESRB/2011/1)
 14. The results of the assessment showed that Member States had complied well with the Recommendation. The assessment will be repeated 

when credit conditions return to levels prevailing prior to the crisis. In
 2013 the ESRB also initiated 
the assessment of the implementation of the Recommendation on the macro-prudential mandate of 

national authorities (ESRB/2011/3) 15.The ESRB uses various channels to ensure accountability, including hearings in the European 

Parliament. In
 2013 the ESRB Chair appeared before the European Parliament™s Committee on 

Economic and Monetary Affairs on three occasions.The ESRB published its 2012 Annual Report on 8 July 2013. On the same date the Chair of the ESRB addressed a public letter to EU authorities on the forthcoming ESRB review, including 
13 OJ C 170, 15.6.2013, p. 1.14 OJ C 342, 22.11.2011, p. 1.15 OJ C 41, 14.2.2012, p. 1.136ECBAnnual Report
2013
Governor Stefan Ingves (Chair of the ESRB™s Advisory Technical Committee) and Professor 

André Sapir (Chair of the ESRB™s Advisory Scientific Committee).2.2 ANALYTICAL, STATISTICAL, LOGISTICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL SUPPORT TO THE ESRBThe ECB continued to ensure the ESRB Secretariat in
 2013 and thereby provided analytical, 
statistical, logistical and organisational support to the ESRB. In the third year of ESRB operations, 

the ECB again contributed to the regular identification, monitoring and assessment of EU-wide 

systemic risks. ANALYTICAL SUPPORTAs in previous years, the ECB provided analytical support to the ESRB in the form of contributions 

to the regular reports on the systemic risks faced by the EU financial system and the potential 

impact of those risks.Contributions are based on both ECB expertise and information collected through market 
intelligence efforts, in particular to support the process of identifying systemic risk. Regular work 

on the surveillance and assessment of systemic risk also relies on, and benefits from, information 

received from the various member institutions of the ESRB. Systemic risk indicators and early 

warning systems are both important analytical tools that feed into the risk surveillance work of 

the ESRB. The risk assessment is supported, in particular, by macro-stress-testing tools and the 

analysis of propagation channels and contagion in order to assess and rank the potential severity of 

specific risks.In addition, the ECB contributed to the various strands of work initiated by the ESRB to assess 
systemic risk, as well as to the preparation of recommendations on regulatory matters or legislative 

initiatives. More recently, the ECB has been involved in five new strands of work.
16 These are related to macro-prudential tools and the corresponding tasks that the Capital Requirements 

Regulation and Directive (CRR/CRD IV) assign to the ESRB. These strands of work, established 

under the ESRB™s Instruments Working Group (IWG), are expected to cover institutional aspects, 

the modalities of activation, adjustment and deactivation of macro
-prudential tools (including 

indicators), as well as the prevention and mitigation of systemic risk. Moreover, the ECB chaired an 

IWG Expert Group on guidance on the setting of counter-cyclical buffer rates.In cooperation with the NCBs, the NSAs and the ESAs Œ via the ESRB™s Advisory Technical 
Committee and its sub-structures Œ the ECB regularly reviews the available tools, with a view to 

continuously improving the analytical framework and, where necessary, developing new tools to 

fill the analytical gaps identified.The ESCB™s Macro-prudential Research Network plays an important role in this regard.
17 The work 
done so far can be grouped according to the Network™s three main strands of work: (i) macro-
financial models linking financial stability and the performance of the economy; (ii) early warning 

systems and systemic risk indicators; and (iii) the assessment of contagion risks.16 These are: (i) tools addressing real estate; (ii) tools addressing liquidity; (iii) tools addressing systemic banks and systemic risks; (iv) the 
flexibility package; and (v) the setting-up of coordination packages for tools.17 The establishment of the Network was approved by the General Council of the ECB in 2010. Its objective is to develop core conceptual 
frameworks, models and/or tools that support research into ways of improving macro-prudential supervision in the EU.137ECBAnnual Report2013The ECB organised a workshop in November 2013 on early warning tools and other tools supporting 
macro-prudential policies. This workshop, attended by members of the ESCB Macro-prudential 

Research Network and the IWG Expert Group on guidance on the setting of counter-cyclical buffer 

rates, facilitated consolidation of the various insights from research and policy perspectives.STATISTICAL SUPPORTIn 2013 the ECB, assisted by the NCBs, continued to provide statistical support to the ESRB 

through several channels, in full knowledge that the reliable collection and dissemination of data 

are key for the identification, assessment and mitigation of systemic risk.The ECB, in accordance with Decision ESRB/2011/6
 18, continued to contribute by regularly 
providing the ESRB with a wide range of ESCB statistics and other information. In particular, 
through close cooperation between the ECB and the ESAs, steps were taken to enhance the 

quality of the aggregated supervisory information that the ESAs transmit to the ECB. The ECB 

also took important steps to ensure that the ESAs and the ESRB have access to non-published, 

non-confidential ESCB statistical information. This exchange of information among the ESCB, the 

ESRB and the ESAs also reflects the important work undertaken by the ESRB Contact Group on 

Data in fostering cooperation among institutions to enhance the relevance, reliability and timeliness 

of data.Reflecting its expertise in statistical issues, the ECB continues to make an important contribution 
to the ESRB™s risk surveillance and risk analysis work with a quarterly macro-prudential review 

that presents detailed statistical information on the different dimensions of systemic risks faced 

by the national and EU financial systems. In
 2013 this quarterly macro-prudential review was 

complemented with a semi-annual summary assessment of risks faced by national EU banking 

systems, aimed at supporting a discussion on national differences and developments across the 

respective banking sectors.The ECB was also involved in revising and developing further the ESRB risk dashboard so that it 
can address the evolving nature of risks in the EU financial sector. Providing statistical information 

on risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system, the ESRB risk dashboard is a key communication 

instrument of the ESRB and an important element in meeting the accountability requirements vis-

à-vis the general public. Since March 2013 the ESRB risk dashboard has also been available via the 

ECB™s Statistical Data Warehouse.193 FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION3.1 BANKINGIn 2013 the ECB continued to contribute to the work being carried out at the international and EU 

levels on financial regulation and supervision.A major step towards enhancing the resilience of the financial system in the EU was taken in
 2013, with the implementation of the new international standards of the Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision (BCBS) on capital and liquidity (Basel III) in the EU through the Capital Requirements 
18 OJ C 302, 13.10.2011, p. 3.19 See the ﬁReportsﬂ section of the Statistical Data Warehouse (http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu).
138ECBAnnual Report
2013Regulation and Directive (CRR/CRD IV)
20. The provisions of the Regulation are directly applicable 
in all Member States as of 1 January 2014. They form a ﬁsingle rulebookﬂ for financial regulation 
and supervision across the EU, thus ensuring equal regulatory treatment of institutions providing 

financial services in the Single Market and enhancing financial integration in Europe. The single 

rulebook also provides a sound basis for the uniform application of rules in the context of the Single 

Supervisory Mechanism, which will become fully operational in November
 2014 (for more details, 
see Section 1 of this chapter). From a central bank™s perspective, the appropriate design and calibration of the new liquidity rules 
are of particular importance, as the new requirements may have an influence on the conduct of 

monetary policy and the functioning of money markets. In the light of this, the ECB is conducting 

monitoring work to assess the likely impact of both the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the 

net stable funding ratio (NSFR). In particular, the ECB has contributed to the work of the BCBS 

to ensure that the LCR responds appropriately to the provision and withdrawal of central bank 

liquidity, and the revised LCR released by the BCBS in January
 2013 reflects the views of the 
ECB.21 At the EU level, the CRR gives the European Banking Authority (EBA) a mandate to 
prepare guidelines and assessments on liquidity regulation. For example, the EBA is mandated to 

assess the economic impact of the LCR and to report on appropriate uniform definitions of liquid 

assets. In view of the need to carefully assess the interaction between liquidity regulation and 

monetary policy, the ECB is contributing to this work, which will also be reflected in a legal act to 

be developed in the course of 2014. With regard to the NSFR, the EBA is currently collecting data 

to monitor this ratio. Further work will be carried out in line with the progress being made by the 
BCBS. 3.2 SECURITIESThe ECB was very active in 2013 in the area of securities regulation.Following the evidence of reference rate manipulation that emerged in
 2012, the ECB has 
actively participated in the reform efforts on reference interest rates undertaken by the European 
Commission, the EBA and the European Securities and Markets Authority, as well as the 

International Organization of Securities Commissions.While the choice of reference rates that better reflect end-user needs is ultimately the responsibility 
of the users themselves, the systemic relevance of reference rates justifies the active involvement 

of central banks in the reform process to uphold the reliability, integrity and representativeness of 

key euro area reference interest rates. The ECB™s involvement in this work has taken the following 

forms: (i) participation in public consultations conducted by regulators; (ii) public reminders to 

banks to act responsibly and assume collective responsibility to safeguard the functioning of key 

reference rates, thus preventing potential disruption to the functioning of financial markets while 

the regulatory framework is being refined; (iii) acting as a catalyst for market initiatives to assess 

the options for reforming the current reference rates, in particular EURIBOR, and collecting money 

market transaction data for the EURIBOR administrator (Euribor-EBF) to ascertain the feasibility 
20 Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit 
institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012; Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and 
of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and 
investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC.21 The Basel III liquidity rules foresee a phasing-in of the LCR, starting with 60% in 2015 and rising by 10 percentage points each year until 

100% is reached in 2019. In the EU, the CRR envisages a more rapid phasing-in, with full implementation by 2018.139ECBAnnual Report2013of a transaction-based unsecured money market reference rate; and (iv) participation in the work 
of the Official Sector Steering Group for benchmark reform set up by the Financial Stability Board 

(FSB).22 In 2013 the ECB also prepared an opinion on the European Commission™s proposal for a regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts.23The ECB was also involved in international initiatives aimed at strengthening the regulation 

of shadow banking, participating in the policy and regulatory debate at the level of the FSB. In 

particular, the ECB contributed to the revised recommendations to strengthen the oversight and 

regulation of shadow banking published by the FSB on
 29 August 2013.24 The recommendations set out a framework to deal with the financial stability risks posed by shadow banking entities other 

than money market funds and by securities financing transactions. The FSB recommendations also 

stressed the need for more transparency with regard to repo and securities lending transactions in 

view of their relevance for monetary policy implementation and financial stability. In this context, 

the ECB is studying the possible establishment of a European aggregator of secured financing data, 

taking into account the need to leverage the existing market infrastructures and minimise the burden 

on the reporting entities.3.3 ACCOUNTINGIn 2013 the ECB continued to contribute to the accounting work carried out in various fora, 

including in sub-structures of the BCBS and the EBA.Throughout the year the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continued to work on aligning their respective accounting 

frameworks. Work predominantly related to the completion of the financial instruments project, 

including the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, impairment and 

hedge accounting, and to leases. Accounting for financial instruments is relevant from a financial stability perspective because of 
its potential to create volatility in banks™ income statements, thereby increasing pro-cyclicality in 

the financial system. The current proposals on impairment aim to address the ﬁtoo little too lateﬂ 

problem of accounting for expected credit losses. There is still a significant divergence of opinions 

on this topic between the IASB and the FASB, and this project is therefore not expected to be 

finalised until the first half of 2014.The IASB issued its new standard on hedge accounting at the end of
 2013. It aims to improve the ability of investors to understand risk management activities and to assess the amounts, timing and 

uncertainty of future cash flows, thereby contributing to greater financial stability.Finally, accounting for leases is also important from a financial stability perspective, because it is 
likely to affect the calculation of banks™ leverage ratios under the Basel III capital framework. The 

IASB and the FASB are both assessing this issue and the ECB is closely following the discussion.22 For more details on the ECB™s initiatives in the area of reference rate reform, see the article entitled ﬁReference interest rates: role,

140ECBAnnual Report
20134 FINANCIAL INTEGRATIONThe Eurosystem and the ESCB contribute to enhancing European financial integration by: 
 (i) raising awareness of and monitoring financial integration; (ii) acting as a catalyst for private 
sector activities by facilitating collective action; (iii) giving advice on the legislative and regulatory 

framework for the financial system and direct rule-making; and (iv) providing central banking 

services that foster financial integration.RAISING AWARENESS OF AND MONITORING FINANCIAL INTEGRATIONSince 2007 the ECB has published an annual report on ﬁFinancial integration in Europeﬂ
 25. The 2013 issue of the report included a new chapter on institutional reforms in the light of financial 
integration, regarding in particular the decision to establish a banking union and major developments 

towards the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The report also focused 

on: (i) recent developments in financial integration in the euro area; (ii) Eurosystem activities in 

the area of financial integration; (iii) euro area money market segmentation in a low interest rate 

environment; (iv) the integration of the euro retail payments market; (v) sectoral accounts and 

rebalancing in the euro area; and (vi) a structural comparison of the EU and US money markets to 

demonstrate implications for financial integration.On 25 April 2013 the ECB and the European Commission organised a joint conference on 
ﬁFinancial integration and stability: the impact of ongoing reforms on financial integration and 

stabilityﬂ. This conference provided an opportunity for experts from both institutions, as well as 

external participants, to discuss ongoing developments in the area of financial integration and 

financial stability. One of the main conclusions was that despite the improvements in financial 

integration during
 2012, the climate in the financial markets remains fragile. Therefore, further 

progress towards the establishment of banking union is needed.The set of quantitative measures used to monitor financial integration was thoroughly reviewed and 
updated in 2013. The standard set of statistical indicators of integration is updated and published 

semi-annually on the ECB™s website. ACTING AS A CATALYST FOR PRIVATE SECTOR ACTIVITIESSEPA 
The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is an initiative aimed at achieving an integrated pan-
European market for retail payment services in euro, with no distinction between cross-border 

and national payments. In
 2013 the initiative moved towards a milestone: the replacement 

by 1 February 2014 of existing national credit transfer and direct debit schemes with SEPA-

compliant alternatives.
26 To promote timely migration, the Eurosystem increased its monitoring and 
support activities in this field in
 2013. The ECB published two SEPA migration reports, in March 

and October 2013, describing the progress made towards migration and providing guidance to the 

market. Communication efforts were increasingly undertaken to raise awareness of the migration, 

especially among citizens and smaller and medium-sized companies. Quantitative and qualitative 

information was collected to monitor the preparedness of national communities and their pace of 

migration. A ﬁbig bangﬂ approach to migration was taken in several countries, and the Eurosystem 

issued warnings about the related risks for the wider supply chain, including ﬁbig billersﬂ, public 25 These reports are available on the ECB™s website.
26 Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 establishing technical and business 
requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009.141ECBAnnual Report2013administrations, businesses and citizens. In December
 2013, according to ECB indicators for the 
euro area, SEPA credit transfers accounted for
 73.8% of all credit transfers, while SEPA direct 
debits represented 41.0% of all direct debits. The European Commission considered that, although the migration had accelerated, it was unlikely 
that it would be fully completed by
 1 February
 2014. Therefore, on
 9 January the Commission 
published a proposal for an EU regulation allowing payment service providers to continue accepting 

payments in the national formats for an additional transitional period of six months. Although not 

challenging the Commission™s proposal, in a press release on
 9 January the ECB urged all market 
participants to complete the transition to the SEPA standards by the original deadline. The ECB 

opinion on the legal proposal was issued on 22 January 2014.27 The draft regulation was submitted 
to the European Parliament and the Council for consideration in February 2014.In 2013 the SEPA Council
 28 met to discuss several issues related to SEPA migration, payment 
schemes, innovation and the related EU legal framework. Given that
 1 February 2014 marked the 
start of a new phase in the integration process of European retail payments, governance issues also 
needed to be reviewed. The ECB, the European Commission and other stakeholders exchanged 
views on the way forward throughout the year. In December the ECB announced the creation of 

the Euro Retail Payments Board, which replaced the SEPA Council, with a wider mandate, a larger 

composition and a strong output-driven approach. Progress is still needed in the field of SEPA for cards. In
 2013 at the second Forum on SEPA Cards 
Standardisation the Eurosystem expressed the view that interoperability is needed. The Eurosystem 
monitored progress in building a SEPA framework for security evaluation and certification of 

payment terminals, and also undertook work on innovations related to card payments, in particular 

the use of smartphones as card payment acceptance devices.The SEPA payment instruments are based on common business practices, technical standards and 
security requirements and lay the foundation for Europe-wide innovative payment solutions. In 

this context, the Eurosystem analysed the emergence of payment initiation services offered by 

non-account-servicing third-party providers and held meetings with stakeholders on the subject in 

March and April 2013. This helped to clarify the notion of access to payment accounts, which was 

taken up in the European Commission™s proposal for a review of the Payment Services Directive 29.Retail payment clearing and settlement infrastructures can play a role in the realisation of an 

integrated retail payments market. In September
 2013 the Eurosystem released updated criteria 
for the SEPA-compliance of such infrastructures
 30, taking into account the developments in the 
relevant market and regulatory framework since criteria were first published in 2008.Finally, every two years the ECB organises a retail payments conference together with an ESCB 
central bank. In October
 2013 this conference was jointly organised by the ECB and the Banque 
de France, and held in Paris. It brought together high-level policy-makers, academics and market 
27 CON/2014/3.28 This was a stakeholders™ forum, co-chaired by the ECB and the European Commission, which aimed to promote an integrated euro retail 
payments market by ensuring the proper involvement of all parties and by fostering consensus on the next steps towards the realisation of 
SEPA.29 Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market

2013participants, and focused on the challenges and opportunities facing market players and public 
authorities in the area of retail payments integration and innovation.SECURITIES MARKETS 
With the aim of reviving the European structured finance market, given its role in the provision of 

loans to the economy and, consequently, its potential importance for long-term economic growth, 

the ECB acts as a catalyst with regard to a number of initiatives related to this market segment. In 

particular, the ECB supports the development of high-quality products that could attract investors 

from the private sector with a medium to long-term investment horizon. In
 2013 the ECB played a 

role in certain such initiatives related to asset-backed securities (ABSs) and covered bonds. With the aim of increasing transparency in the area of ABSs, loan-by-loan reporting became an 
eligibility criterion for ABSs in the Eurosystem collateral framework in
 2013. Loan-level data 

reporting became mandatory for transactions backed by residential mortgages and by loans to small 

and medium-sized enterprises on
 3 January 2013 and for those backed by commercial mortgages 

on 1 March. The same requirements were extended to four additional asset classes (assets backed 

by consumer finance, leases, auto loans and credit card debt) in early
 2014. Loan-level data are 
handled via a market-led single loan-level data repository, the European Data Warehouse, and must 

be provided in accordance with the templates available on the ECB™s website, at least on a quarterly 

basis. Furthermore, the ECB continued to monitor the Prime Collateralised Securities (PCS) 

initiative, which aims to enhance and promote quality, transparency, simplicity and standardisation 

throughout the ABS market in the EU. Assets that fully meet the criteria set by the PCS Association 

are awarded a PCS Label. The ECB acts as a permanent observer in the PCS Association.The ECB also acted as an observer in the Covered Bond Label initiative, which was developed 
by the European Covered Bond Council with the aim of improving standards and increasing 

transparency in the European covered bond market. In
 2013 the Covered Bond Label was brought 

into line with Article
 129 of the Capital Requirements Regulation
31 following input received from 
the ECB, the European Banking Authority and the investor community. ADVICE ON THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND DIRECT 

RULE-MAKING To enhance financial integration, the ECB and the Eurosystem, in line with their advisory and 

regulatory functions, monitor and actively contribute to the development of the EU regulatory 

framework. In addition to these activities, which are covered in other sections of this report,
32 the following ECB activities contributed to increasing financial integration through regulatory 

initiatives.The SEPA project and changes in the regulation of retail payments, along with the need to increase 
the quality, reliability and granularity of payment statistics, prompted the ECB to review its legal 

framework covering such statistics. This involved preparing a new regulation on payment statistics
33 which provides for consistent and harmonised reporting of payment statistics by reporting agents. 

Guideline ECB/2007/9 on monetary, financial institutions and markets statistics is also being 

revised in order to enhance the statistical information provided by the NCBs, including with regard 

to payment data.
34 The new legal framework for payment statistics will take effect from data

institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.32 See in particular Section 3 of this chapter and Section 6.2 of Chapter 2.

143ECBAnnual Report2013referring to the second half of
 2014. Further information on the legal texts regulating the enhanced 
payment statistics can be found in Section 4 of Chapter 2.In September and October
 2013 the ECB was consulted on the European Commission™s proposals 
for three legal acts: a proposal for a directive on the transparency and comparability of payment 
account fees, payment account switching and access to a basic payment account, and a legislative 

package comprising a review of the Payment Services Directive and a regulation on interchange fees 

for card-based payment transactions. All three proposals are aimed at achieving more integrated, 

competitive and efficient payment services, in line with users™ needs. The ECB™s opinion on the 

first legal act was published in November.
35 The ECB opinions on the latter two legal acts were 
published in February 2014.36, 37The ECB participated in the UNIDROIT Study Group, which had the task of preparing draft 

principles regarding the enforceability of close-out netting provisions.
38 The UNIDROIT Governing 
Council, at its 92nd session held from 8 to 10 May 2013, adopted the Principles on the Operation of 

Close-out Netting Provisions. The ECB supports the objectives of the principles, which are designed 

to improve the enforceability of close-out netting, especially in cross-jurisdictional situations, in 

order to provide a sound basis, in commercial and insolvency law terms, for risk management and 

mitigation by financial institutions and for the application of regulatory policies in the international 

context.At the EU level, the ECB participates in the European Commission™s Securities Law Directive 
Member States Working Group, which is pursuing harmonisation of the legal framework for 

holdings and transfers of intermediated securities. The ECB™s interest in this area relates in 

particular to collateral management rules, such as the regulation of collateral reuse.Furthermore, the ECB contributes to the work of the European Post Trade Group, a joint initiative 
of the European Commission, the ECB, the European Securities and Markets Authority and the 

Association for Financial Markets in Europe. The group is mandated to contribute to the development 

of an efficient, safe and sound post-trade market in the EU and, as such, it builds on the work carried 

out in previous initiatives, i.e. by the Expert Group on Market Infrastructures and the Clearing and 

Settlement Advisory and Monitoring Expert Group II. The scope of the present work is limited to 

areas of financial harmonisation which are currently not covered by other existing regulatory or 

industry initiatives. This work is therefore complementary to the current regulatory initiatives of the 

Commission and to the implementation of the TARGET2-Securities (T2S) programme.PROVIDING CENTRAL BANKING SERVICES WHICH FOSTER FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
TARGET2, the second generation of the Eurosystem™s large-value payment system, is the first 

market infrastructure which is completely integrated and harmonised at the European level. The 

Eurosystem has continued to make enhancements to TARGET2 in collaboration with the banking 

industry (see Section 2.1 of Chapter 2).T2S Œ the future single securities settlement engine of the Eurosystem Œ will have an important 

impact on the harmonisation and integration of the post-trading environment in Europe. T2S will

2013automatically remove many of the ﬁGiovannini Barriersﬂ
 39 to cross-border clearing and settlement 
by, among other things: (i) providing a single IT platform with a common interface and a single 
messaging protocol; (ii) introducing a harmonised operational day for all connected markets; and 

(iii) extending a single harmonised settlement model comprising delivery versus payment in central 

bank money to all national and cross-border transactions. Nevertheless, even with a single technical platform there are still significant barriers to cross-border 
 settlement which must be removed in order for financial markets to reap the full benefits of 
financial integration in the post-trade environment. The T2S Advisory Group, which is part of the 

T2S governance, is responsible for, among other things, fostering the T2S post-trade harmonisation 

agenda and identifying where markets that will use T2S are lagging behind the rest of Europe in 

the implementation of commonly agreed harmonisation standards. The group publishes regular 

harmonisation progress reports (the fourth report will be published in March 2014) and constantly 

monitors the progress made by markets that will be connected to T2S. These reports are shared with 

the T2S Board and the ECB™s Governing Council and place the T2S Advisory Group at the core of 

the harmonisation agenda, giving a major boost to T2S and the broader post-trade harmonisation 

work in Europe conducted in cooperation with the European Commission and other relevant actors 

(see Section 2.2 of Chapter 2).Finally, in the area of collateral management, the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) 
has fostered financial integration since its implementation in
 1999, by enabling all euro area 
counterparties to use on a cross-border basis eligible assets as collateral in Eurosystem credit 

operations, regardless of the location of the counterparty or the country in which the asset has 

been issued. The Eurosystem is currently working on enhancements to the CCBM, which will be 

implemented in 2014 (see Section 2.3 of Chapter 2).5 OVERSIGHT OF PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND MARKET 
INFRASTRUCTURES 
Through its oversight function, the Eurosystem aims to ensure the safety and efficiency of payment, 
clearing and settlement systems processing the euro, as well as of payment instruments, major 

service providers and other critical infrastructures, by monitoring and assessing them against 

applicable oversight standards and, where necessary, inducing change.40The Eurosystem has translated its oversight objectives into specific standards and requirements 

that financial market infrastructures should meet. These standards and requirements are based 

on internationally accepted oversight standards. On
 3 June 2013 the Governing Council adopted 

the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs), introduced in April
 2012 by the 
Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the BIS and the Technical Committee of 

the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), for the conduct of Eurosystem 

oversight in relation to all types of financial market infrastructures. It also decided to launch a 

public consultation on a draft regulation on oversight requirements for systemically important 
39 These barriers are technical or market-practice barriers, legal barriers or barriers related to tax procedures (more information can be found 
on the official website of the European Union (http://europa.eu)).40 Detailed information on the Eurosystem™s oversight function and activities is also provided by the ECB on its website and through specific 
Eurosystem oversight reports, including the Eurosystem oversight policy framework published in July 2011 (available on the ECB™s 
website).145ECBAnnual Report2013payment systems, which implements the PFMIs in a legally binding way. The draft regulation, 
together with a press release, was published on the ECB™s website on 7 June 2013. The PFMIs replace the previous CPSS Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems 
(CPSIPS), the CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems, as well as the 

CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations for Central Counterparties. They are designed to make financial 

market infrastructures more resilient to defaults by system participants and to financial crisis. 

The Eurosystem considers a timely and consistent implementation of the new principles by major 

economies to be important in order to strengthen global financial stability, enhance the ability of 

financial market infrastructures to manage various risks and avoid the risk of regulatory arbitrage.5.1 LARGE-VALUE PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE PROVIDERSLarge-value payment systems form the backbone of the euro area market infrastructure and play an 

important role for the stability and efficiency of the financial sector and the overall economy. The 

Eurosystem applies a well-defined oversight policy framework to all large-value payment systems 

that settle euro-denominated transactions Œ both its own system and those that are privately operated. 
TARGET2The oversight of TARGET2 is led and coordinated by the ECB, acting in close cooperation with 

all euro area NCBs and other central banks connected to TARGET2. In
 2013 the Eurosystem™s 
oversight of TARGET2 focused on operational risk issues and a gap analysis of the system against 

the new PFMIs. The new requirements introduced by the PFMIs include the analysis of tiered 

participation arrangements, the establishment of a comprehensive risk management framework and 

the analysis of general business risks. The few areas for improvement identified in the gap analysis 

related to the new principles.The Eurosystem also conducted an analysis of TARGET2 interdependencies, including system-
based, institution-based and environmental interdependencies (including those which could arise 

from the connection with TARGET2-Securities), with the objective of increasing the overseer™s 

and operator™s awareness of risks stemming from such interdependencies. The need to address 

risks stemming from interdependencies is recognised by the PFMIs. The analysis of TARGET2 

interdependencies focuses on the risks that other entities pose to TARGET2 and contributes to 

the identification of entities which are critical for TARGET2™s performance, as well as to the 

assessment of related risks and of the effectiveness of the risk management measures applied by the 

TARGET2 operator.In addition, the Eurosystem continued its analysis of transaction-level TARGET2 data, using 
a dedicated simulator tool. This quantitative analysis supports and complements the standard-

based oversight of TARGET2. Other work focused on the implementation of stress-testing for 

TARGET2, the definition and testing of risk or early warning indicators, and an analysis of the 

structure of indirect participation in TARGET2. Additionally, studies on the functioning of the 

interbank money market in the euro area were conducted, relying on a database for money market 

transactions identified on the basis of TARGET2 payments. EURO1 
EURO1 is a large-value payment system for transactions in euro between banks operating in the 

EU. It is operated by EBA CLEARING. EURO1 works on a multilateral net basis, while the 
146ECBAnnual Report
2013end-of-day positions of EURO1 participants are ultimately settled in central bank money via the 
TARGET2 system, with the ECB acting as the settlement agent.The ECB is entrusted with primary oversight responsibility for EURO1, acting in close cooperation 
with all euro area NCBs. In 2013 EBA CLEARING changed the loss-sharing calculation method 

to be used in EURO1 in the event of more than three participants defaulting. The new approach 

is simpler than the previous one (as, in the event that multiple participants default, it applies the 

same regime regardless of the number of defaulted participants) and gives EURO1 participants 

an incentive to manage credit risk in the system more actively, as their loss share will depend on 

the bilateral limits granted to the defaulted participant(s). In the light of the systemic relevance of 

EURO1 in the euro area payment landscape, the Eurosystem assessed the impact that the change 

might have on EURO1™s compliance with the applicable oversight standards. It concluded that the 

changed loss-sharing calculation method would not adversely affect the legal structure and risk 

profile of the EURO1 system.The ECB is also closely monitoring the implementation of the recommendations that were made 
to the system operator following the comprehensive assessment of EURO1 against the CPSIPS 

in 2011. CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM The Continuous Linked Settlement system (CLS) is operated by CLS Bank International 

(CLS Bank). It provides a multi-currency service for the synchronous Œ i.e. payment versus 
payment (PvP) Œ settlement of payment instructions relating to foreign exchange transactions. 

Through its PvP mechanism, CLS is designed to eliminate the principal risk associated with the 

settlement of foreign exchange transactions. CLS currently settles in
 17 of the world™s most traded 
currencies, including the euro. Given that CLS Bank is established in the United States, the Federal 

Reserve System accepts primary oversight responsibility for CLS under a cooperative oversight 

arrangement involving the G10 central banks and the central banks of issue of currencies settled by 

CLS. The ECB, in close cooperation with the euro area NCBs, is part of this cooperative oversight 

arrangement and has primary oversight responsibility for settlement in euro by CLS.In 2013 the ECB™s oversight activities with respect to CLS covered, among other things, the 
progress achieved on strategic initiatives and the review of additional risk mitigation services 

considered by CLS, including the launch of a same-day settlement session between the US dollar 

and the Canadian dollar. The ECB also organised a meeting of the Euro CLS Group, which serves 

as a euro area forum for exchanging views on CLS-related issues and developments, at which initial 

discussions were held on a possible European same-day settlement session.SWIFT 
SWIFT is important from a financial stability perspective, as it provides secure messaging 

services to the financial community in more than
 210 countries. The central banks of the G10 have 
established a cooperative oversight arrangement for SWIFT. The ECB and some other euro area 

NCBs contribute to various oversight activities carried out by the cooperative oversight group, 

with the Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique being the lead overseer. In 

addition, a SWIFT Oversight Forum was set up in order to expand to a larger group of central banks 

information-sharing and dialogue in relation to SWIFT oversight. The SWIFT cooperative oversight activities are conducted in the framework of a yearly SWIFT 
oversight plan, which is prepared using a risk-based oversight planning approach. They focus on 147ECBAnnual Report2013those SWIFT services with a potential impact on systemic risk for the global financial infrastructure. 
In 2013 the oversight activities continued to focus on the implementation of the Distributed 

Architecture project, which improves SWIFT™s resilience. Other major SWIFT projects being 

closely monitored included the renewal of the FIN software, which aims to mitigate technology 

risk and reduce costs, while ensuring strategic alignment of IT platforms. Furthermore, overseers 

also reviewed the enterprise risk management, business continuity, logical security features and the 

cyber defence of SWIFT operations, as well as the resilience tests conducted with the participation 

of the user community. 5.2 RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND PAYMENT INSTRUMENTSThe Eurosystem also has oversight responsibility for retail payment systems and payment 

instruments. The oversight standards for retail payment systems, which draw on the CPSIPS, 

have been reviewed to take into account the implementation of the PFMIs and also to reflect the 

increased integration of retail payment systems owing to the harmonisation of technical standards 

and procedures resulting from the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project. SEPA gives 

incentives to an increasing number of retail payment systems either to establish cross-border 

links with other such systems or to offer services in more than one country. The revised oversight 

framework therefore includes a new classification for euro retail payment systems, reflecting the 

importance of a system from a European perspective. The revised framework also incorporates the 

oversight expectations for links between retail payment systems which were adopted by the ECB™s 

Governing Council in 2012. With respect to retail payment systems, the ECB is the lead overseer of the STEP2 system, which is 
a pan-European automated clearing house for retail payments in euro and is managed and operated 

by EBA CLEARING. STEP2 offers the processing of different kinds of retail payment, such as 

SEPA credit transfers and SEPA direct debits as well as ﬁnationalﬂ transactions within Italy and 

Ireland, which are processed according to domestic technical standards and limited to the national 

banking community. In
 2013 important changes in the services of STEP2 were subject to an 
oversight assessment. The assessed changes included the introduction of an additional settlement 

cycle in the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) service, the implementation of the Electronic Banking 

Internet Communication Standard (EBICS) and the addition of a third data centre to the technical 

infrastructure. The changes did not affect the full compliance of the system with the applicable 

oversight standards.Concerning payment instruments, in
 2013 the focus of Eurosystem oversight remained on payment 
cards. The Eurosystem made further progress on the oversight assessments of international card 
payment schemes active in the euro area. Moreover, the ECB published the second Eurosystem 

report on card fraud with cards issued in SEPA. The second report included, for the first time, 

information on fraud at the level of each EU country and revealed that the overall levels of card 

fraud had decreased further between 2010 and 2011. In January 2013 the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments, which is composed of 
EU overseers and supervisors of payment service providers, launched a public consultation on a 
set of draft recommendations for ﬁpayment account accessﬂ services. Later in the year, the Forum 

took note of the European Commission proposal for a revised payment services directive, published 

in July 2013, which assigns to the European Banking Authority (EBA) the task of developing, in 
148ECBAnnual Report
2013close cooperation with the ECB, guidelines on the security aspects of payment services. This led the Forum to decide to transmit the final text of its recommendations to the EBA and not to publish 

it, as doing otherwise could have created confusion among market stakeholders. At the same time, 

however, the Forum agreed to prepare and make public a document in which it summarises the 
core elements of its work and how best to ensure security of payment account access services. This 

document also reflected how the Forum took on board the valuable feedback that it received from 

the market. Furthermore, in November
 2013 the Forum launched a public consultation on the recommendations 
that it developed for the security of mobile payments. The Forum also examined the possibilities 
for harmonising the reporting of major security incidents for retail payment systems, payment 

schemes and payment service providers within the EU. Finally, to ensure consistent assessments 

by overseers and supervisors, the Forum prepared an assessment guide for the implementation of 

its January 2013 final recommendations for the security of internet payments. This guide was made 

available on the ECB™s website in February 2014. 5.3 SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENTThe Eurosystem has a strong interest in the smooth functioning of securities clearing and settlement 

systems because failures in the clearing, settlement and custody of securities could jeopardise 

the implementation of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of payment systems and the 

maintenance of financial stability. In recent years, much of the work in this area has focused on 

contributing to major EU legislative initiatives aimed at establishing a common EU framework for 

financial market infrastructures. CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES AND TRADE REPOSITORIESIn 2013 efforts focused on ensuring the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) No
 648/2012 
on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories Œ also known as the European 

Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) Œ which entered into force in
 2012, as well as of the 
respective regulatory and implementing technical standards. Following the entry into force of most technical standards in March
 2013, central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories had to submit an application for (re)authorisation under EMIR to 

the competent authorities. In the case of CCPs, the deadline for application was September
 2013. The national competent authorities, supported by colleges of authorities, then began the process 

of deciding whether CCPs were compliant with the EMIR framework and should therefore be 

authorised. As envisaged by EMIR, the ECB and the Eurosystem NCBs are members of the colleges 

in their role as the central bank of issue for the euro. Therefore, the Eurosystem will be closely 

involved in the authorisation process for all EU CCPs with a high volume of euro-denominated 

central clearing business. In November 2013 the European Securities and Markets Authority, which is responsible for the authorisation of trade repositories, took over supervisory responsibility for trade repositories 

authorised in the EU. The ECB participated in
 2013 in the cooperative oversight arrangement for 
the trade depository DDRL UK, which was led by the UK™s Financial Conduct Authority. 149ECBAnnual Report2013CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORIESIn 2013 the ECB contributed to the discussions on primary legislation as well as on the drafting 
of technical standards under the proposed regulation on improving securities settlement in the 

EU and on central securities depositories (CSDs). This regulation will establish a common EU 

framework for the authorisation and supervision of CSDs. The ECB strongly supports the 

European Commission™s proposal to strengthen the legal framework applicable to CSDs, also in 

the context of the future TARGET2-Securities environment. Political agreement on the regulation 

between the European Parliament, the European Commission and the EU Council was reached in 

December 2013, paving the way for its entry into force in 2014. TARGET2-SECURITIESTARGET2-Securities (T2S) is an infrastructure project that aims to provide European CSDs with a 

single, pan-European platform for securities settlement in central bank money. The Eurosystem will 

oversee T2S services and cooperate with the competent supervisors and overseers of participating 

CSDs, as well as with central banks of issue for eligible non-euro currencies, in order to share with 

them comprehensive T2S-related information so that they can perform their statutory duties under 

their respective legal framework.Work on the Eurosystem oversight framework for T2S, as well as the cooperative arrangement 
with other authorities, progressed in
 2013. Furthermore, the pre-assessment of the T2S design was 
updated. Since T2S is still in the development phase, a final assessment is not yet possible and will 

have to be conducted closer to the launch of the platform. The distinctive entrance building (in the foreground of the double office tower) and the long horizontal expanse of the 
Grossmarkthalle round off the building ensemble and define the look of the ECB.The entrance building not only projects out of the Grossmarkthalle, but also rises above it by a few metres. To enable 
its construction, three of the 15 concrete shells forming the roof of the Grossmarkthalle were removed. These were not 

original shells, but replacements for those destroyed during the Second World War. As they therefore were not part of the 

original substance of the building, it was possible Œ in agreement with the historic preservation authorities Œ to remove 

them to make way for the entrance building.The northern facade of the entrance building, behind which the press centre is located, is particularly striking: in contrast 
to that of the double office tower, it is a three-dimensionally curved surface consisting of hyperbolic glass panels. Below
 it, panels of glass break up the concrete grid facade of the Grossmarkthalle, clearly marking the main entrance to the ECB.151ECBAnnual Report2013CHAPTER 5EUROPEAN ISSUES1 POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL ISSUESAs Europe pursued its policy efforts to cope with the consequences of the economic and financial 
crisis, 2013 saw a continuation of intense cooperation among EU institutions and bodies, in 

particular the European Council, the ECOFIN Council, the Eurogroup, the European Commission, 

the European Parliament and the ECB.The President of the ECB participated regularly in Eurogroup and ECOFIN Council meetings 
when matters related to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB were discussed. Moreover, the 
President of the ECB was invited to take part in European Council meetings, when issues related 

to the EU™s policy response to the economic and financial crisis were addressed, as well as in 

euro summit meetings. The President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner for Economic and 

Monetary Affairs and the Euro participated in meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, 

when considered appropriate.PROGRESS TOWARDS DEEPER ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNIONIn 2012 the Heads of State or Government of the EU agreed on the objective of breaking the 

negative feedback loops between banks and their sovereigns, putting a stop to the increasing 

fragmentation of European financial markets and promoting their integration. Important steps 

were taken in this area in 2013, in particular as regards the establishment of the Single Supervisory 

Mechanism (SSM). In addition, in December 2013 a general approach was adopted by the ECOFIN 

Council with regard to the establishment of a Single Resolution Mechanism, and final agreement 

was reached in the ﬁtrialogueﬂ between the European Parliament, the EU Council and the European 

Commission on the proposed deposit guarantee scheme directive and the proposed bank recovery 

and resolution directive. Further information regarding the establishment of the SSM can be found 

in Section 1.3 of Chapter 4.On 20 March 2013 the European Commission issued a communication on the ex ante coordination 
of major economic reforms, following up on the European Council conclusions of December 2012. 

The December 2013 European Council invited the President of the European Council, in close 

cooperation with the President of the European Commission, to carry work forward on a system 

of mutually agreed contractual arrangements and associated solidarity mechanisms and to report 

to the October 2014 European Council with a view to reaching overall agreement on both of these 

elements. As stressed by the European Council, concrete new steps towards strengthening economic 

governance will need to be accompanied by further steps towards stronger democratic legitimacy 

and accountability at the level at which decisions are taken and implemented. THE EUROPEAN SEMESTER 
In November 2012 the European Commission presented its 2013 Annual Growth Survey, which 

reviews progress towards Europe 2020 targets, sets out the key measures for recovery and growth 

for the EU as a whole and marks the start of the European Semester. The 2013 survey stressed the 

need for Member States to (i) pursue differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, (ii) restore 

normal lending to the economy, (iii) promote growth and competitiveness, (iv)
 tackle unemployment 

and the social consequences of the crisis, and (v) modernise public administration. The Annual 

Growth Survey for 2014, presented by the European Commission on 13 November 2013, reiterates 
these priorities.152ECBAnnual Report
2013At its meeting in March 2013 the European Council endorsed the above five priorities for 2013, 
which Member States incorporated into their stability or convergence programmes and national 

reform programmes. Following a review of these programmes, including the implementation 

of the voluntary commitments under the Euro Plus Pact, the ECOFIN Council issued policy 

recommendations to each Member State in July 2013, ahead of the adoption of national budgets and 

other economic reforms which takes place in the second half of the year.In the context of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure, which aims to prevent and correct 
macroeconomic imbalances, the European Commission published the second Alert Mechanism 

Report in November 2012. On the basis of 11 macroeconomic indicators and economic analysis, 

the report identified 14 Member States whose macroeconomic situation was scrutinised more 

closely. In April 2013 the Commission published in-depth reviews examining the origin, nature 
and severity of possible macroeconomic imbalances in 13 of the countries identified in the report.
1 These countries received policy recommendations under the preventive arm of the macroeconomic 

imbalance procedure. The third Alert Mechanism Report was published in November 2013. 

It found that EU economies had continued to make progress in correcting their external and internal 
imbalances but that further progress was needed. It concluded that it was therefore necessary to 

analyse in further detail the accumulation and unwinding of imbalances, and the related risks, in 

16 Member States.The 2013 European Semester saw the first round of implementation of the ﬁtwo-packﬂ regulations, 
which entered into force in May 2013. The two-pack further strengthens surveillance of euro 

area countries, building on and complementing the Stability and Growth Pact. Under these new 

rules, euro area countries submit their draft budgetary plans to the European Commission and 
the Eurogroup in the autumn so as to ensure ex ante coordination of Member States™ budgets as 

well as of the fiscal stance in the euro area as a whole. The two-pack also puts in place enhanced 
surveillance for countries under financial stress and post-programme surveillance for countries 

which have completed a macroeconomic assistance programme. The experience with the 2013 European Semester showed that the implementation of policy 
recommendations, in particular with regard to structural reforms, is still an issue that warrants 

stronger monitoring throughout the year. In this context, the European Council in June 2013 

concluded that the EU Council and the European Commission should closely monitor the 

implementation of the country-specific recommendations provided to Member States in the context 

of the European Semester. A first interim overview of the recommendations was provided by the 

Commission in the 2014 issue of the Annual Growth Survey, which concluded that progress had 

been made in the area of fiscal consolidation, but that financial market fragmentation had led to 

very divergent interest rates for loans to businesses and households across the EU, and that in 

several Member States further progress was needed in the implementation of structural reforms. THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACTIn 2013 the majority of EU countries, most of them from the euro area, were still subject to 

excessive deficit procedures (EDPs). Nevertheless, as a result of consolidation efforts, the total 

number of countries subject to an EDP declined to 16, compared with 20 at the end of 2012. In June 2013 the ECOFIN Council issued new recommendations for half of the countries under 
EDPs, namely Belgium, Spain, France, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Poland, 
1 The in-depth review did not cover Cyprus, which was about to implement a macroeconomic adjustment programme.
153ECBAnnual Report2013and re-opened an EDP for Malta, only half a year after abrogating the previous EDP. The recommendations proposed deadline extensions for correcting the excessive deficit, which in most 

cases exceeded the ﬁone year as a ruleﬂ extension foreseen under the Stability and Growth Pact. 

Spain, France, Slovenia and Poland were granted a two-year extension, with the deadline being 

moved to 2014 for Poland, to 2015 for France and Slovenia and to 2016 for Spain. The deadline 
for Cyprus was extended by four years, to 2016. A one-year extension was granted only to the 

Netherlands, to 2014, and Portugal, to 2015. Under its renewed EDP, Malta was given a deadline 

of 2014. The ECOFIN Council gave notice to Belgium as it had not taken effective action to correct 

its excessive deficit by the 2012 deadline. The country was granted an extension of the deadline by 

the ECOFIN Council and has to ensure a sustainable correction of the excessive deficit from 2013 

onwards and sufficient progress towards its medium-term objective in 2014. In
 December 2013 the ECOFIN Council adopted a new recommendation for Poland, extending the deadline for 

the correction of the excessive deficit by one year, to 2015. For most countries, the new EDP 

recommendations also implied a substantial reduction of the recommended corrective effort by 

comparison with previous EDP recommendations.Five EU Member States, namely Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Romania, had their EDPs 
abrogated by ECOFIN Council decisions in June 2013. These decisions were based on Eurostat 

data confirming that the deficits of these countries had fallen below 3% of GDP and the European 

Commission™s projections that the deficits would remain below this threshold in 2013 and 2014.2One milestone of the fiscal governance framework was the fiscal compact, which entered into force 

on 1 January 2013 as part of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic 

and Monetary Union. Participating Member States were obliged to transpose into their national 

legislation by 1 January 2014 the commitment to maintain a balanced budget throughout the cycle 

and to introduce an automatic correction mechanism for potential deviations.3Overall, the concrete transposition of the fiscal compact into national law differs widely across 

countries. For example, countries have different formulations in terms of the balanced budget rule 

and underlying legal instruments. For countries that have not yet achieved their medium-term 
 objective, the convergence path towards it is generally defined as annual adjustment of the 

structural balance towards the objective of 0.5% of GDP. However, the underlying definitions of 

the ﬁescape clausesﬂ for temporary deviations from the medium-term objective or the adjustment 

path towards it range widely. There are also differences regarding the automaticity of the correction 

mechanism in the event of significant deviations from the medium-term objective or the adjustment 

path towards it, while only a few countries have followed the common principles set out by the 

European Commission on the nature, size and time frame of corrective action. Finally, regarding 

the monitoring institutions, independent fiscal councils are currently being set up in a number of 
countries, while the existing councils appear to fulfil most of the criteria specified by the European 

Commission. The success of the monitoring institutions will, however, ultimately depend on their 

impact on the relevant policy debates.CONVERGENCE REPORTAt the request of the Latvian authorities, the ECB published on 5 June 2013 its assessment of 

the economic and legal convergence of Latvia in line with Article 140 of the Treaty. The ECB™s 
2 In Lithuania, the general government deficit stood at 3.2% of GDP in 2012. However, when the direct net costs of a pension reform are 
accounted for, the deficit threshold was met in 2012.3 24 of the 25 countries that signed the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union have thus 
far ratified the treaty. 154ECBAnnual Report
2013Convergence Report examined whether a high degree of sustainable economic convergence had 
been achieved in Latvia and gauged Latvijas Banka™s compliance with the statutory requirements 

that an NCB has to fulfil in order to become an integral part of the Eurosystem. The report noted 

that, while the longer-term sustainability of its economic convergence remained a concern, all in all 

Latvia was within the reference values of the convergence criteria (see also Chapter 3).2 EU ENLARGEMENT AND RELATIONS WITH EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES AND POTENTIAL CANDIDATESFurther progress was made in the EU enlargement agenda over 2013. On 1 July Croatia became 

the 28th EU Member State, making it the second country of former Yugoslavia to join the EU after 

Slovenia in 2004.Moreover, the EU opened accession negotiations with Serbia in January 2014 and started discussions 
with Kosovo
 4 on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement in October 2013, following a European 
Council decision in June. This decision recognised the agreement reached by Serbia and Kosovo on 

the normalisation of their bilateral relations. In October the European Commission recommended opening negotiations with the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, for the fifth time since 2009. The European Commission recommended for 

the second time that Albania™s status be upgraded from a potential candidate to a candidate country. 
Accession negotiations with Montenegro, which started in June 2012, continued; two negotiation 
chapters have been provisionally closed. In October 2013 the European Council decided to open a 

new negotiation chapter with Turkey; accession negotiations with the country have been ongoing 

since 2005, with one negotiation chapter provisionally closed. Accession negotiations with Iceland 

(opened in 2010) were put on hold by the Icelandic government following the general elections in 

April 2013.On the basis of its analysis of economic and financial developments in EU candidate countries, 
the ECB continued its policy dialogue with the central banks of these countries in 2013 through 

bilateral meetings and within the overall institutional framework for the enlargement process set 

up by the EU. The ECB held its annual high-level policy dialogue with the Central Bank of the 

Republic of Turkey in June in Ankara. A high-level policy dialogue was held for the first time with 

the Central Bank of Montenegro in July in Podgorica. Moreover, close relations with the central 
banks of candidate countries and potential candidates, as well as those of other countries, have been 

maintained through technical cooperation programmes (see Section 2 of Chapter 6).4 This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the 
International Court of Justice™s opinion on Kosovo™s declaration of independence. The eastern interior facade of the entrance building, which separates the press centre from the main lobby, consists of 
translucent glass panels mounted on a customised steel grid. The translucency of the glass panels is created by sandblasting 
the glass.157ECBAnnual Report2013CHAPTER 6INTERNATIONAL ISSUES1 K
EY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMSURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMYGiven the high degree of global economic and financial integration, a good understanding 
 of the international environment through monitoring and analysis is essential to policy-making in 
the euro area. The ECB also plays an important role in the process of international multilateral 

surveillance of macroeconomic policies and financial stability, which at the central banking level 

is mainly coordinated by the BIS. Moreover, the ECB participates in working groups and meetings 
 of international organisations such as the IMF and the OECD, as well as fora such as the G20 and 

G7 finance ministers and central bank governors.In 2013 the international economic environment was characterised by a restrained economic 
recovery, with GDP growth projected to have declined to 1.3% for advanced economies (compared 

with 1.4% in 2012) and to 4.7% for emerging market and developing economies (compared with 

4.9% in 2012), according to the latest IMF projections. Amid this subdued global economic recovery, 

discussions in international institutions and fora stressed the need to increase the momentum of 

the global recovery and to tackle near-term risks to the economic outlook, while at the same time 

strengthening the foundations for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. In that context, the G20 

leaders at their St Petersburg summit agreed on a set of actions designed to boost economic activity 

and job creation and to support the medium-term recovery. In particular, they agreed on a new 

framework to safeguard fiscal sustainability, on boosting investment, on increasing productivity 

and labour force participation by stepping up structural reform efforts and on addressing internal 

and external demand rebalancing. The international community also stressed the importance of a 

more inclusive pattern of growth as unemployment, particularly among young people, remained 

persistently high.As regards central banks™ actions, discussions at the global level showed broad consensus that the 
accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies, including unconventional monetary 

policy measures, had been supportive of the global recovery. At the same time, there was recognition 

of the need to remain mindful of unintended consequences and potential spillover effects on other 

countries. 
The ECB continued to play an active role in the G20 and its various work streams. Under the 
Russian presidency in 2013 these work streams focused on: (i) improving the foundations for strong, 
sustainable and balanced growth (including an agreement on the post-Toronto fiscal consolidation 

strategies); (ii) advancing the global financial regulatory agenda (including progress in the fields 

of Basel III implementation, over-the-counter derivatives, global systemically important financial 

institutions and shadow banking); (iii) strengthening the international financial architecture, with 

a particular focus on IMF quota and governance reform; (iv) addressing tax base erosion and 

profit-shifting; and (v) improving the availability of long-term investment financing. In September 

2013 the G20 leaders adopted the St Petersburg Action Plan, which focuses on policy actions to 

support the near-term recovery and improve the medium-term foundations for global growth, and 

on strengthening financial stability. In addition, the G20 members endorsed their Accountability 

Assessment, in which they took stock of previous policy commitments.158ECBAnnual Report
2013Finally, the euro area itself is subject to international policy surveillance exercises by the IMF and 
the OECD. In 2013 the IMF conducted its regular review of the monetary, financial and economic 

policies of the euro area, as a complement to its reviews of the individual euro area countries. 
 The ECB also participated in discussions related to the IMF™s Financial Sector Assessment Program 
 for the EU.REFORMS IN INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES AND PRACTICESFollowing standard practice, the ECB continued to monitor and to help shape developments in the 

international monetary system in 2013. While progress was made in implementing reforms related 

to increasing IMF resources and improving IMF surveillance and governance, the completion of 

the 2010 IMF quota and governance reform is being held up by delays in ratification by a sufficient 

majority of the membership.As part of the efforts to overcome the global financial crisis, it was decided that the optimal way 
to further augment IMF resources in the short term was through new temporary bilateral loans 

and note purchase agreements with its members. During the Spring Meetings of the IMF and 
 World Bank in 2012 38 countries (including 18 EU Member States) committed to increase IMF 
 resources by USD 461 billion through bilateral borrowing agreements. By the end 
 of December 2013 agreements with 30 of these countries (15 of which were EU Member States) 

had come into effect for a total amount of USD 424 billion.Following the 2011 Triennial Surveillance Review, the IMF has undertaken major initiatives 
 to strengthen surveillance to respond to a more globalised and interconnected world. These 
initiatives include revising the legal framework for surveillance, deepening the analysis of risks 

and financial systems, stepping up assessments of members™ external positions, responding more 

promptly to membership concerns, and better addressing the possible effects of spillovers from 

members™ policies on global stability.On the operational side, a Spillover Report has been published since 2011, assessing the impact 
of economic policies in the world™s five largest economies on partner economies. The 2013 report 

examined in particular potential spillovers arising from the euro area crisis, US fiscal and monetary 

policy, structural and fiscal reforms in Japan, and a possible slowdown in China. Similarly, a Pilot 

External Sector Report was produced in 2012 and 2013, providing an assessment of the external 

positions of 29 systemic advanced and emerging market economies, including the euro area as a 

whole and several euro area members individually.In May 2013 the IMF strengthened its debt sustainability analysis by updating its Staff Guidance Note 
for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market-Access Countries, which will lead in particular 
 to more in-depth analysis with respect to the underlying assumptions and macro-fiscal risks.The effectiveness and credibility of the IMF hinges on its broad membership, which should be 
reflected in its governance. A comprehensive review of the current quota formula was completed 

in January 2013, when the IMF Executive Board submitted its report to the Board of Governors. 

The outcome of this review will form the basis for Executive Board discussions as part of the 15th 

General Review of Quotas. Originally brought forward by about two years to January 2014, the 
deadline for the completion of the 15th General Review of Quotas has been put back to January 

2015, owing to delays in implementing the 2010 IMF quota and governance reform. European 

countries have already taken actions that will lead to a reduction of advanced European country 

representation in the IMF Executive Board by 1.64 seats.159ECBAnnual Report20132 COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EUIn 2013 the ECB actively participated alongside the European Commission in the EU™s 
macroeconomic dialogue with key emerging market economies (e.g. China, India, Israel 
 and Russia). As in previous years, the Eurosystem organised seminars and workshops with non-EU 

central banks in order to foster policy dialogue. A high-level seminar with the Bank of Russia was 

held on 15 February in Moscow. The topics of the seminar were economic developments in Russia 

and the euro area and the changing role of central banks in terms of both monetary policy and 

financial stability and supervision.TECHNICAL COOPERATIONThe technical cooperation provided by the Eurosystem remained an important tool for strengthening 

the institutional capacity of central banks outside the EU, especially in EU candidate and potential 

candidate countries, and for enhancing compliance with European and international standards.The ECB commemorated ten years of ECB-coordinated technical cooperation with a conference 
held on 3-4 December 2013 in Frankfurt. Since 2003 the ECB, together with the NCBs, has 

implemented several EU-funded technical cooperation programmes for the benefit of central banks 

and banking supervisors in various countries. In addition, the ECB has strengthened its long-term 
cooperation with a number of central banks through memoranda of understanding. In December 2013 the ECB and 21 NCBs completed an EU-funded technical cooperation 
programme with the National Bank of Serbia. This programme, which was launched  in February 2011, helped the National Bank of Serbia to strengthen its institutional capacities and 

align its processes and regulations with EU and international standards. In July 2013 the Eurosystem completed a technical cooperation programme with the National Bank 
of the Republic of Macedonia. The ECB and 11 NCBs participating in the programme presented a 

needs analysis report to the Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, which 

covered ten areas of central banking. The report contained an assessment of the central bank™s 

current institutional and operational framework, as well as recommendations to further strengthen 

its institutional capacity to bring it closer to EU central banking standards.On 19 December 2013 the ECB signed a contract with the European Commission to carry out 
technical cooperation with the Bank of Albania and the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo. 

The ECB will implement the programme in partnership with 11 NCBs. The programme will 

assess the current institutional and operational frameworks of the central banks and compare them 

with EU central banking standards. The Bank of Albania and the Central Bank of the Republic  of Kosovo will each receive a needs analysis report with recommendations on how to reinforce 

their institutional capacity and bring their practices more in line with EU central banking standards. 
 The programme will also take stock of priorities for further strengthening the institutional capacity 

of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and possibly of other central banks in the region.
The ECB and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey continued their cooperation and regular 
policy dialogue based on a memorandum of understanding signed in July 2012. In 2013 cooperation 

included a joint conference on international linkages and spillovers in Izmir, a seminar on financial 

statistics in Ankara and a six-month secondment of a staff member from the Central Bank of the 

Republic of Turkey to the ECB. 160ECBAnnual Report
2013Cooperation also continued under the memorandum of understanding with the Bank of Russia 
that was signed in October 2012, which covers cooperation at the technical level as well as policy 

discussions. In 2013 activities focused mainly on monetary policy and financial stability and took 

place in the form of seminars; a member of staff from the Bank of Russia was also seconded to 
the ECB. Events on the topic of banking supervision were also held in the course of the year, with 
the involvement of several euro area NCBs, as well as the European Systemic Risk Board and the 

European Banking Authority.In 2013 the ECB and the People™s Bank of China continued implementing their memorandum of 
understanding through meetings of their bilateral working group and information exchanges at staff 

level. The memorandum, which was signed in 2008, aims to strengthen cooperation between the 

two institutions and foster information-sharing. As part of the EU-China Trade Project, the ECB 

received three groups of staff from the People™s Bank of China to discuss monetary policy, market 

operations and IT security.In line with the ﬁhouse-in-houseﬂ concept designed by the Viennese architects COOP HIMMELB(L)AU, the conference 
area and staff restaurant have been integrated into the Grossmarkthalle as separate building elements. These have a 
structural framework of steel posts and beams, and individual facades consisting of thermal insulation glass. While the new building elements are enclosed units with their own temperature regulation system, the open areas of the Grossmarkthalle 

surrounding them will be affected by the seasonal air temperatures outside.163ECBAnnual Report2013CHAPTER 7EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION 
 AND ACCOUNTABILITY1 ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMMUNICATION POLICY Central bank independence has established itself over the past few decades as an indispensable 
element of the monetary policy regimes of both advanced and emerging market economies. 
 The decision to grant central banks independence has long been firmly supported by economic 

theory and empirical evidence, both of which show that such a set-up is conducive to maintaining 

price stability. At the same time, it is a founding principle of democratic societies that any 

independent institution bestowed with a public function must be accountable to citizens and their 

representatives. Accountability is therefore an important counterpart of central bank independence.The ECB™s commitment to accountability and transparency is illustrated by its reporting to 
European citizens and their elected representatives, the European Parliament. The Treaty lays down 

precise reporting requirements for the ECB, which include the publication of a weekly financial 

statement, a quarterly report and an annual report. The ECB goes far beyond these statutory 

obligations in its regular reporting, for instance by publishing a Monthly Bulletin, rather than 

the required quarterly report. The ECB™s commitment to accountability and transparency is also 

illustrated by the numerous speeches delivered by the members of the Governing Council, which 

deal with a broad variety of topics of relevance to the ECB™s tasks. In addition, the President of the 

ECB appears four times a year before the European Parliament. The ECB also replies to written 

questions from Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and publishes these questions and 

answers on its website.On 3 November 2013 the Council Regulation conferring specific tasks on the ECB concerning 
policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions entered into force. From 

4 November 2014 onwards the ECB will assume its full role as single supervisor and in particular 
will directly supervise significant banks in the countries participating in the Single Supervisory 

Mechanism (SSM). Supervisory tasks will be carried out by the ECB separately from its tasks relating 

to monetary policy and from its other tasks. Banking supervision therefore requires a different 
form of accountability from the other tasks conferred on the ECB by the Treaties. Pursuant to the 

relevant provisions in the above-mentioned SSM Regulation, the ECB and the European Parliament 

signed an inter-institutional agreement in November 2013 to ensure an appropriate framework of 

accountability for the ECB™s supervisory tasks. In addition, the ECB and the EU Council signed 

a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) laying down in more detail the provisions of the SSM 

Regulation on cooperation between the two institutions and the accountability obligations related to 

the ECB™s supervisory tasks. The MoU entered into force on 11 December 2013. External communication at the ECB aims to enhance the public™s understanding of the ECB™s 
policies and decisions and, as such, is an integral part of the ECB™s monetary policy and its other 

tasks. Two key elements Œ openness and transparency Œ guide the ECB™s communication activities. 

Both contribute to the effectiveness, efficiency and credibility of the ECB™s monetary policy and its 

other statutory tasks. They also support the ECB™s efforts to give a full account of its actions.The ECB™s concept of real-time, regular and comprehensive explanations of its monetary 
policy assessment and decisions, which was introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely open and 

transparent approach to central bank communication. Monetary policy decisions are explained at a 

press conference immediately after the Governing Council has taken them. The President delivers 
164ECBAnnual Report
2013a detailed introductory statement at the press conference, explaining the Governing Council™s 
decisions. The President and Vice-President are then at the media™s disposal to answer questions. 
Since December 2004 decisions taken by the Governing Council other than those setting interest 
rates have also been published every month on the websites of the Eurosystem central banks.ECB legal acts are made available in all the official languages of the EU, as are the Governing 
Council™s monetary policy decisions, the decisions taken by the Governing Council in addition to 
decisions setting interest rates, and the consolidated financial statements of the Eurosystem.
1 The ECB™s Annual Report is also made available in full in all official EU languages.
2 The Convergence 
Report and the quarterly issues of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin are made available either in full 

or in summary form in all official EU languages.
3 For the purposes of public accountability 
and transparency, the ECB also publishes other documentation Œ in addition to the statutory 

publications Œ in some or all official languages, in particular press releases announcing staff 
macroeconomic projections, policy positions and information of relevance to the general public. 

The preparation, publication and distribution of the national language versions of the ECB™s key 

publications are undertaken in close collaboration with the NCBs.2 ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTThe European Parliament, as the only EU institution whose members are directly elected by the 

citizens of the EU, plays a key role in holding the ECB to account. In 2013 the two institutions 

continued their close and fruitful dialogue. The President of the ECB appeared four times in 2013 before the European Parliament™s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to inform MEPs about recent economic and monetary 

developments and to answer their questions. Furthermore, he participated in the two plenary 

sessions of the European Parliament at which the ECB™s Annual Reports for 2011
 and 2012 were 
discussed and in a meeting of the Parliament™s Conference of Presidents in December 2013. Other members of the ECB™s Executive Board also appeared before the European Parliament. The 
Vice-President presented the ECB™s Annual Report for 2012 to the Committee on Economic and 

Monetary Affairs. Jörg Asmussen participated in an exchange of views in the same committee alongside 

Commissioner Rehn to give the ECB™s assessment of the situation in Cyprus and to answer questions 

from members. Peter Praet participated in the European Parliamentary Week on the European Semester 

for Economic Policy Coordination. In addition, ECB staff provided technical expertise to the European 

Parliament on issues related to the ECB™s field of competence, such as the SSM and the economic 

situation in countries under an EU-IMF adjustment programme. Furthermore, the ECB answered 
 42 written questions by MEPs and published the replies on its website in 2013. 
BANKING UNIONThe preparations for the SSM figured prominently in the exchanges between the ECB and 

the European Parliament. Discussions mainly focused on the separation between supervision 

and monetary policy-making and on the accountability framework for the SSM. The latter was 

formalised in the inter-institutional agreement that entered into force in November 2013. The two

temporary EU derogation in May 2007).3 See footnote 2.165ECBAnnual Report2013institutions agreed on the need for the Supervisory Board of the SSM to be set up swiftly so that rapid 
progress might be made in selecting the Chair of the Supervisory Board. The European Parliament 

was involved in this selection process as foreseen in the provisions of the SSM Regulation. MEPs 

also asked about the modalities of the comprehensive assessment being conducted by the ECB in 

preparation for the SSM. In his regular hearings the President of the ECB stressed the importance of 

this exercise for the credibility of banking union and for long-term growth prospects. Another key issue was the work towards establishing a Single Resolution Mechanism and the 
finalisation of the single rulebook. The President of the ECB repeatedly stressed to the Committee 

on Economic and Monetary Affairs the importance of having uniform rules for banking resolution 

as soon as possible. He also emphasised on numerous occasions how vital it was that banking union 

be completed with a Single Resolution Mechanism as a necessary complement to the SSM. FINANCING CONDITIONS OF THE REAL ECONOMYDuring the committee hearings of the President of the ECB, a number of MEPs voiced concerns 

about the financing conditions of the real economy, in particular of small and medium-sized 

enterprises. They inquired about possible measures to reduce the significant divergences prevailing 

across euro area countries. The President underlined the importance of completing banking union to rein in fragmentation and 
to improve financing conditions for the private sector across the euro area. He also stressed the 

role of Outright Monetary Transactions in this respect and explained on various occasions the non-

standard measures of the ECB. At the same time, the President and other ECB representatives also made it clear that national 
governments and the legislators at both the national and the European level had to undertake 

the necessary steps to decrease fragmentation in a sustainable fashion for the benefit of the real 

economy.3 COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIESThe ECB addresses a variety of audiences Œ the media, financial experts, academia, parliaments 

and public institutions, as well as the general public Œ with varying levels of knowledge regarding 

finance and economics. Its mandate and decisions are therefore explained through a range of 

communication tools and activities which are constantly being refined in order to make them as 

effective as possible, taking into account the different audiences and the relevant communication 

environments and needs.In 2013 the Executive Board confirmed that strengthening communication remained one of the 
medium-term strategic priorities of the ECB. The ECB™s communication activities continued to 

focus on the ECB™s accommodative monetary policy, efforts to maintain ample liquidity conditions 

for the banking sector and the strengthening of the governance and functioning of the euro area. 

The vast majority of public speeches delivered by members of the Executive Board were related to 

these issues. In addition, communication activities were conducted in the countries under EU
-IMF 
financial assistance programmes. These topics also dominated the questions and requests for 

information received from the media, the public and visitors to the ECB. 166ECBAnnual Report
2013The ECB publishes a number of regular and periodic studies and reports. These include the Annual 
Report, which presents a review of the ECB™s activities in the previous year, and the Monthly 

Bulletin, which provides regular updates on the ECB™s assessment of economic and monetary 

developments and detailed information underlying its decisions. The ECB issued 201 press releases 

in 2013, covering all aspects of the ECB™s policies and activities, as well as additional information 

related to the implementation of monetary policy. The ECB also provides a wide range of statistical 

data, primarily by means of the Statistical Data Warehouse and interactive charts on the ECB™s 

website.All members of the ECB™s Executive Board continued to contribute directly to enhancing public 
knowledge and understanding of the Eurosystem™s tasks and policies by giving testimonies before 

the European Parliament, delivering public speeches and granting interviews to the media. Over the 

course of 2013 the members of the Executive Board delivered more than 150 speeches to a variety 

of audiences and granted over 140 interviews to the media. Some of the speeches were translated 

into several official EU languages to make them accessible to a wider audience.In 2013 the ECB organised 20 seminars for journalists at its premises, as well as one in Amsterdam 
and one in Brussels. They were all aimed at enhancing the knowledge and understanding of the 

media as regards the ECB™s mandate, tasks and activities. Some of these seminars were organised 

in cooperation with the NCBs, the European Commission, the European Journalism Centre and 

other public authorities. In addition to the monthly press conference following the meetings of 

the Governing Council, the ECB organised numerous press briefings aimed at fostering a greater 

understanding of other ECB policies and actions.The ECB welcomed 587 groups of visitors to its current and future premises in Frankfurt in 2013. 
Some 16,312 visitors received first-hand information in the form of presentations given by ECB 

staff and tours of the site of the new ECB premises.A number of high-level international conferences, workshops and seminars were organised in
 2013, including an ECB workshop on ﬁNon-standard monetary policy measuresﬂ, a conference entitled 

ﬁThe future of banking regulation and supervision in the EUﬂ, and several events organised 

in cooperation with other institutions, such as ﬁFinancial integration and stability: the impact of 

ongoing reforms on financial integrationﬂ with the European Commission. As in previous years, in 

May 2013 the ECB had an information stand at the open day events hosted by the EU Council in 

Brussels and the European Parliament in Strasbourg. For the first time, the ECB also joined the EU 

delegation to the United States at their open days, informing US citizens and other visitors about the 

ECB and the euro banknotes and coins.All documents published by the ECB and other information about its various activities are 
available on the ECB™s website. In 2013 the website received 27 million visits; 517 million pages 

were viewed and 75 million documents were downloaded. In 2013 the ECB replied to around 

80,000 enquiries from the public requesting information on issues related to the ECB™s activities, 

policies and decisions. The ECB has further expanded its presence in social media. Its Twitter 

account has around 100,000 followers and is used to highlight publications and speeches. In 2013 

the ECB opened a Google+ page which relays the ECB™s RSS information and is actively followed 

in particular by other EU institutions and economists. A Facebook page is maintained for the 

Generation •uro Students™ Award competition. In addition, the ECB uses its YouTube channel to 

publish videos of its monthly press conferences and other films.167ECBAnnual Report2013In an effort to strengthen its educational outreach activities the ECB and the euro area NCBs released 
a new web-based educational game called ﬁTop Floor Œ Make Your Way Up!ﬂ in April and an 

animation entitled ﬁThe ECB and the Eurosystem explained in three minutesﬂ in September
 2013. Both are available in the ﬁEducationalﬂ section of the ECB™s website. On 17 April 2013 Mario Draghi and the governors of the respective euro area NCBs presented the 
Europe-level prizes to the teams that had won the national contests of the Generation •uro Students™ 

Award 2012/13. This competition, which is held each year, aims to enhance the understanding of 

teenagers of the central bank™s role in the economy. More than 3,500 students from the euro area, 
aged between 16 and 19, entered the competition. The following year™s competition was launched 

on 1 October 2013. With regard to communication activities concerning the SSM, the ECB created a new ﬁBanking 
Supervisionﬂ section on its website in September 2013. This section provides information about 

key features of the SSM and important milestones in its development. These web pages will be 

developed further as the ECB prepares to assume full responsibility for supervision in November 
2014. In October 2013 the ECB communicated the details of the comprehensive assessment 

being conducted in preparation for the SSM. The list of banks subject to the assessment was also 

published. The details can be found in the ﬁBanking Supervisionﬂ section of the ECB™s website.Communication activities in 2013 also focused on euro banknotes, in particular in relation to the 
preparations for the changeover in Latvia
4 and the issuance on 2 May of the new •5 banknote, 
which was the first denomination of the new series of euro banknotes. The ECB implemented a 

number of communication measures aimed at informing the general public and cash handlers about 

the new banknote and its updated security features. These measures included over 3 million leaflets 

sent to businesses which handle cash on a day-to-day basis in April 2013, a set of videos produced 

for the internet for the launch in May 2013, a digital marketing campaign in the months following 

the issuance to direct people searching for information on the new banknote online to the ECB™s 

dedicated banknote website,
5 and a travelling exhibition on the euro banknotes and coins, which 
visited Frankfurt, Madrid, Bratislava and Riga over the course of 2013. To help key stakeholders 

such as banknote equipment manufacturers, commercial banks and major retailers prepare for the 

issuance of future denominations, the ECB organised a major partnership event in Brussels in 

November 2013. In 2013 the EUROPEAN CULTURAL DAYS of the ECB were dedicated to Latvia and organised 
in close cooperation with Latvijas Banka. From 16 October to 15
 November 2013 a wide variety of 
events were held at various locations in Frankfurt, featuring some of the most characteristic aspects 

of Latvian culture. The programme included classical music, avant-garde pop music, literature 

readings, film screenings, a theatre project, exhibitions focusing on architecture and photography, 

and several special events for children. The EUROPEAN CULTURAL DAYS were launched 

in 2003 and have become a fixture in the cultural life of Frankfurt and the surrounding area. The 

initiative aims to raise awareness of the EU™s cultural diversity and foster mutual understanding 

among Europeans. 4 For more details, see Section 4 of Chapter 3.
5 www.new-euro-banknotes.euThe panes of glass for the facade of the atrium Œ which connects the two polygonal towers Œ are mounted on a customised steel grid. The grid is strong enough to bear the weight of the glass panels along the full height of the atrium and is 
therefore clearly visible through them. In line with the design concept, the glazing of the atrium is neutral in colour and transparent. This enables people to see straight through the atrium and clearly distinguish the two separate towers of the 
high-rise. This impression of a transparent atrium is enhanced by its roof, which is also made of glass. The glass is coated in 
such a way that it absorbs less than 10% of the energy from the sun, though the sky can still be seen through it.169ECBAnnual Report2013CHAPTER 8INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND ORGANISATION1 D

GOVERNANCE OF THE ECB1.1 THE EUROSYSTEM AND THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKSThe Eurosystem is the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the ECB and the NCBs 
of the EU Member States whose currency is the euro (18 since 1 January 2014). The ESCB is 
composed of the ECB and the NCBs of all EU Member States (28 since 1 July 2013), i.e. it also 

includes the NCBs of the Member States which have not yet adopted the euro.The ECB is the core of the Eurosystem and the ESCB and ensures that the operations which form part of the tasks of the ESCB are carried out either through its own activities or via the NCBs, to 

which the ECB shall have recourse to the extent deemed possible and appropriate. The ECB is an 

EU institution and has legal personality under public international law.Each NCB has legal personality according to the law of its respective Member State. The euro 
area NCBs, which form an integral part of the Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred upon the

NCBs also contribute to the work of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through their participation 

in the Eurosystem/ESCB committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). They may perform 
 non-Eurosystem functions on their own responsibility, unless the Governing Council finds that 

such functions interfere with the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem.The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by the decision-making bodies of the ECB: 
 the Governing Council and the Executive Board. The General Council is constituted as a third 
decision-making body of the ECB, for as long as there are EU Member States which have not yet 

adopted the euro. The functioning of the decision-making bodies is governed by the Treaty, the 

Statute of the ESCB and the relevant Rules of Procedure.
1 Decision-making within the Eurosystem 
and the ESCB is centralised. However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs jointly contribute, 

strategically and operationally, to attaining the common goals of the Eurosystem, with due respect 

to the principle of decentralisation in accordance with the Statute of the ESCB.1.2 THE GOVERNING COUNCILThe Governing Council comprises the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the 

governors of the NCBs of the Member States which have adopted the euro. In view of Latvia™s 

adoption of the euro as of January 2014, the Governor of Latvijas Banka, the central bank of Latvia, 

was invited to attend the meetings of the Governing Council in an observer capacity between July 

and December 2013. The Governing Council™s main responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaty, are: Œto adopt the guidelines and take the decisions necessary to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem; Œto formulate the monetary policy of the euro area, including, as appropriate, decisions relating 

to intermediate monetary objectives, key interest rates and the supply of reserves in the 

Eurosystem, and to establish the necessary guidelines for their implementation.In the context of the ECB™s new responsibilities relating to the prudential supervision of credit 

institutions, the Governing Council also has the competence to adopt decisions related to the general 

framework under which supervisory decisions will be taken. Furthermore, it will adopt decisions 

relating to the micro-prudential and macro-prudential supervisory tasks conferred on the ECB, in 

accordance with the SSM Regulation and the ECB™s Rules of Procedure.The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an in-depth assessment of monetary and economic developments 

and takes related decisions specifically at its first meeting of the month, while the second meeting 

usually focuses on issues related to other tasks and responsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem. 
1 For the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, see: Decision ECB/2014/1 of 22 January 2014 amending Decision ECB/2004/2 of 19 February
 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank; Decision ECB/2004/2 of 19 February 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 33; Decision ECB/2004/12 of 17 June 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the General Council of the ECB, OJ L 230, 30.6.2004, p. 61; and Decision ECB/1999/7 of 12 October 1999 concerning the

Bratislava and the other hosted by the Banque de France in Paris. In addition to these meetings, the 

Governing Council may also hold meetings by means of teleconference or take decisions by written 

procedure.When taking decisions on monetary policy and on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, the 
members of the Governing Council do not act as national representatives, but in a fully independent 
personal capacity. This is reflected by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ applied within the 

Governing Council. In 2008 the Governing Council decided to continue its existing voting regime Œ 

as provided for by Article 10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB Œ and to introduce a rotation system only 

when the number of governors in the Governing Council exceeds 18.The Governing Council is assisted by the ECB Audit Committee with regard to matters related to 
the corporate governance of the ECB and the Eurosystem.172ECBAnnual Report

governors of the NCBs of all 28 EU Member States. When Croatia joined the EU in July 2013, 

the Governor of Hrvatska narodna banka became a member of the General Council.
2 The General 
Council mainly carries out those tasks taken over from the European Monetary Institute which still 

have to be performed because not all the Member States have adopted the euro. These tasks include 

strengthening cooperation between the NCBs, supporting the coordination of the monetary policies 

of the Member States with the aim of ensuring price stability, and monitoring the functioning of 

ERM II. Moreover, it reports Œ in the form of the ECB™s Convergence Report Œ to the EU Council 

on the progress made by Member States which have not yet adopted the euro in fulfilling their 

obligations regarding the achievement of EMU. It also contributes to the advisory functions of the 

ECB. In 2013 the General Council had its four quarterly meetings, as well as one meeting for the 

adoption of the ECB™s Convergence Report.2 The Governor of Hrvatska narodna banka was invited to attend the meetings of the General Council in an observer capacity from 
December 2011, in preparation for Croatia™s accession to the EU.176ECBAnnual Report

AND THE EUROSYSTEM IT STEERING COMMITTEEThe Eurosystem/ESCB committees have continued to play an important role in assisting the ECB™s 
decision-making bodies in the performance of their tasks. At the request of both the Governing 

Council and the Executive Board, the committees have provided expertise in their fields of 

competence and have facilitated the decision-making process. Membership of the committees is 

usually restricted to staff of the Eurosystem central banks. However, the NCBs of the Member States 

which have not yet adopted the euro take part in the meetings of a committee whenever it deals with 

matters that fall within the field of competence of the General Council. Where appropriate, other 

competent bodies may also be invited.On 17 July 2013 the Governing Council established an Organisational Development Committee 
to advise on planning issues related to the Eurosystem, the SSM and their functions and to steer 

the activities of the Eurosystem Procurement Coordination Office (EPCO) and the framework for 

Eurosystem/ESCB operational risk and business continuity management. As at 31 December 2013 

15 Eurosystem/ESCB committees had been established under Article 9.1 of the Rules of Procedure 

of the ECB. To support the preparatory work related to the establishment of the SSM, some of these 

committees started to meet in an SSM composition, i.e. including staff from national competent 

authorities which are not NCBs.˜˚˛˝˙ˆ˙ˇ˜ˇˇ˜˜˙˚ˇˇ˜˜˚˛˜˙˝˚˜˜˜˜˛˙˙International Relations Committee (IRC)Frank MossLegal Committee (LEGCO)N.N.Market Operations Committee (MOC)Ulrich BindseilMonetary Policy Committee (MPC)Wolfgang SchillOrganisational Development Committee (ODC)Steven KeuningPayment and Settlement Systems Committee (PSSC)Daniela RussoRisk Management Committee (RMC)Carlos BernadellWerner StudenerStatistics Committee (STC)Aurel SchubertHuman Resources Conference (HRC)Steven KeuningTon RoosPentti HakkarainenChristine GraeffIgnazio AngeloniKoenraad de GeestKlaus GressenbauerJosé Luis Malo de MolinaAccounting and Monetary Income Committee (AMICO)Banknote Committee (BANCO)Committee on Controlling (COMCO)Eurosystem/ESCB Communications Committee (ECCO)Financial Stability Committee (FSC)Information Technology Committee (ITC)Internal Auditors Committee (IAC)Budget Committee (BUCOM)Eurosystem IT Steering Committee (EISC)Yves Mersch1) As at 1 January 2014.178ECBAnnual Report
2013Three further committees exist. The Budget Committee, which was established under Article 15 of 
the Rules of Procedure, assists the Governing Council in matters related to the ECB™s budget. The 

Human Resources Conference was established in 2005 under Article 9a of the Rules of Procedure 

as a forum for the exchange of experience, expertise and information among Eurosystem/ESCB 

central banks in the field of human resources management. The Eurosystem IT Steering Committee 

was established in 2007 by the Governing Council, with a mandate to steer continuous improvement 
in the use of IT within the Eurosystem.1.6 CORPORATE GOVERNANCEIn addition to the decision-making bodies, the corporate governance of the ECB encompasses a 

high-level ECB Audit Committee as well as a number of external and internal control layers, two 

codes of conduct, an Ethics Framework and rules concerning public access to ECB documents.ECB AUDIT COMMITTEEThe ECB Audit Committee enhances the corporate governance of the ECB and of the Eurosystem 

as a whole. It supports the Governing Council by providing advice and/or opinions regarding its 

responsibilities in respect of (i) the integrity of financial information, (ii) the oversight of internal 

controls, (iii) compliance with applicable laws, regulations and codes of conduct, and (iv) the 

performance of audit functions. The ECB Audit Committee is chaired by Erkki Liikanen (Governor 

of Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank) and comprises two other Governing Council members 


 Jean-Claude Trichet). Its mandate is available on the ECB™s website.EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe Statute of the ESCB provides for two control layers, namely the external auditor, which is 

appointed to audit the annual accounts of the ECB (in accordance with Article 27.1 of the Statute of 

the ESCB), and the European Court of Auditors, which examines the operational efficiency of the 

management of the ECB (in accordance with Article 27.2). The annual report of the European Court 

of Auditors, together with the ECB™s reply, is published on the ECB™s website and in the Official 
Journal of the European Union. In order to reinforce public assurance as to the independence of 

the ECB™s external auditor, the principle of audit firm rotation is applied.
3 Good practices for the 
selection and mandate of external auditors, published on the ECB™s website, provide high-level 

guidance for each Eurosystem central bank when selecting their external auditors and determining 

their mandate. They also enable the Governing Council to formulate its recommendations to the EU 

Council on the basis of harmonised, consistent and transparent selection criteria. INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe internal control structure of the ECB is based on an approach in which each organisational 

unit (section, division, directorate or directorate general) has primary responsibility for managing 

its own risks, as well as for ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations. Each 

organisational unit implements operational control procedures within its area of responsibility in 

accordance with the risk tolerance set in advance by the Executive Board.Within the ECB, budgetary responsibility and accountability lies first with the individual business 
areas, which are also responsible for the first level of control. The Budget, Controlling and 
3 Following the conclusion of a tender procedure, Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was appointed as the ECB™s 
external auditor for the financial years 2013-17.179ECBAnnual Report2013Organisation Division is responsible for planning, coordinating, steering and executing all related 
centralised processes as well as for preparing the relevant documentation. It also serves as a second 

level of control and reports to the Executive Board on a regular basis, alerting it to issues where 

necessary.In accordance with its mandate, the Budget Committee assesses the ECB budget planning and 
monitoring reports submitted by the Executive Board and reports on them to the Governing 

Council. It assists the Governing Council in the evaluation of the Executive Board™s annual budget 

proposal before the latter is adopted, and assesses budget monitoring reports and reports on them to 

the Governing Council.As far as the operational risks of the ECB are concerned, the Operational Risk Committee, an internal 
ECB committee, is responsible for stimulating and overseeing the development, implementation 

and maintenance of operational risk management by the business areas that own the risks. It also 

supports the Executive Board in the execution of its role in overseeing the management of the 

operational risks of the ECB.In 2013 the ECB continued, together with the euro area NCBs, to update the operational risk 
assessments of its tasks and processes. It also continued to regularly test and review the business 

continuity arrangements for its critical operations. Furthermore, in cooperation with the NCBs, the 

ECB finalised a business impact analysis to identify the time criticality of Eurosystem functions.As regards financial risks, the ECB™s Directorate Risk Management is responsible for the 
risk management framework applicable to all of the ECB™s financial market operations and for 

monitoring, assessing and proposing improvements to the Eurosystem™s operational framework for 

monetary policy and foreign exchange policy from a risk management perspective.The Risk Management Committee, comprising experts from Eurosystem central banks, assists 
the decision-making bodies in ensuring an appropriate level of protection for the Eurosystem by 

managing and controlling the financial risks originating from its market operations, in the context 

of both the Eurosystem™s monetary policy operations and the ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio. With 
regard to these activities, the Risk Management Committee contributes to, among other things, 

the monitoring, measuring and reporting of financial risks and the definition and review of the 

associated methodologies and frameworks.Independently from the internal control structure and risk monitoring of the ECB, audit missions 
are performed by the Directorate Internal Audit under the direct responsibility of the Executive 

Board. In accordance with the mandate defined in the ECB Audit Charter
 4, the ECB™s internal 
auditors provide independent and objective assurance and consulting services, bringing a 

systematic approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and 

governance processes. The ECB™s internal audit activities conform with the International Standards 

for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing of the Institute of Internal Auditors.A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal Auditors Committee, which is composed of internal 
audit experts from the ECB and the NCBs, assists in the achievement of Eurosystem/ESCB 

objectives by providing independent, objective assurance and consulting services designed to add 

value and to improve the Eurosystem/ESCB.4 This charter is published on the ECB™s website to foster the transparency of audit arrangements in place at the ECB. 
180ECBAnnual Report
2013CODES OF CONDUCTTwo codes of conduct are applicable to the members of the ECB™s decision-making bodies. The 
first code of conduct gives guidance to, and sets ethical standards for, the members of the Governing 

Council and their alternates when exercising their functions as members of the Governing Council.
5 It reflects their responsibility to safeguard the integrity and reputation of the Eurosystem and 

to maintain the effectiveness of its operations. An Ethics Adviser has been appointed by the 

Governing Council to provide guidance to its members on aspects of professional conduct. The 

second code is the Supplementary Code of Ethics Criteria for the members of the Executive Board.
6 It complements the other code of conduct by further detailing the ethical regime applicable to 

members of the Executive Board.The Ethics Framework for members of staff of the ECB
7 provides guidance and sets ethics 
conventions, standards and benchmarks. All staff are expected to maintain high standards of 
professional ethical behaviour in the performance of their duties, as well as in their relations with 

NCBs, public authorities, market participants, media representatives and the public in general. An 

Ethics Officer appointed by the Executive Board ensures a consistent interpretation of the rules.ANTI-FRAUD MEASURESIn 1999 the European Parliament and the EU Council adopted a Regulation
8 to step up the fight against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity detrimental to the Communities™ financial 

interests. The Regulation provides, inter alia, for the internal investigation of suspected fraud by the 

European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) within the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. The 

OLAF Regulation foresees that each of the latter adopt decisions in order for OLAF to be able to 

carry out its investigations within each of them. In 2004 the Governing Council adopted a Decision
9 concerning the terms and conditions for investigations by OLAF of the ECB, which entered into 

force on 1 July 2004.ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING/COUNTER-TERRORIST FINANCING PROGRAMMEIn 2007 the ECB established its internal anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist 

financing (CTF) schemes. The design of the AML/CTF provisions is in line with the 

Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to the extent that they are applicable 

to the ECB™s operations. A compliance function within the ECB identifies, analyses and addresses 

the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing for all relevant activities of the 

ECB. In particular, ensuring compliance with applicable AML/CTF legislation is part of the process 

of assessing and monitoring the eligibility of the ECB™s counterparties. In this context, particular 

attention is paid to restrictive measures adopted by the EU and public statements issued by the 

FATF. An internal reporting system complements the ECB™s AML/CTF framework to ensure that 

all relevant information is systematically collected and duly communicated to the Executive Board.
5 See the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing Council, OJ C 123, 24.5.2002, p. 9, its amendment, OJ C 10, 16.1.2007, p. 6, 
and the ECB™s website. 6 See the Supplementary Code of Ethics Criteria for the members of the Executive Board of the ECB, OJ C 104, 23.4.2010, p. 8, and the

the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), OJ L 136, 31.5.1999, p. 1.9 Decision ECB/2004/11 of 3 June 2004 concerning the terms and conditions for European Anti-Fraud Office investigations of the European 

Central Bank, in relation to the prevention of fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities detrimental to the European Communities™ 
financial interests and amending the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European Central Bank, OJ L 230, 30.6.2004, p. 56.181ECBAnnual Report2013PUBLIC ACCESS TO ECB DOCUMENTSThe ECB™s Decision on public access to ECB documents,10 adopted in 2004, is in line with the objectives and standards applied by other EU institutions and bodies with regard to public access 
to their documents. It enhances transparency, while at the same time taking into account the 

independence of the ECB and of the NCBs and ensuring the confidentiality of certain matters 

specific to the performance of the ECB™s tasks.
11 In 2013 the number of public access requests 
remained limited.10 Decision ECB/2004/3 of 4 March 2004 on public access to European Central Bank documents, OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 42 and Decision 
ECB/2011/6 of 9 May 2011 amending Decision ECB/2004/3 on public access to ECB documents, OJ L 158, 16.6.2011, p. 37.11 In line with the ECB™s commitment to openness and transparency, the ﬁArchivesﬂ section of the ECB™s website provides access to

183ECBAnnual Report20132 ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS2.1 H
UMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENTIn 2013 human resources management activities at the ECB centred on working culture, gender 
diversity, recruitment, professional development and employment conditions. Throughout 2013 

the Directorate General Human Resources, Budget and Organisation was heavily involved in 

organisational preparations for the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), as described in more 

detail in Section 1.3 of Chapter 4.WORKING CULTURE 
In 2013 developments related to the working culture of the ECB continued to focus on professional 

ethics and performance management. With regard to professional ethics, additional provisions to 

prevent and address any possible conflicts of interest were prepared. The rules concerning private 

financial activities, and the monitoring thereof, were also further reviewed in order to maintain 

an effective regulatory ethics framework. With respect to performance management, the ECB 

implemented an ﬁunderperformance procedureﬂ which supports staff members who are required to 

restore their performance to at least a satisfactory level in order to further foster and maintain the 

ECB™s status as a high-performing organisation.DIVERSITYWith the aim of doubling the share of women in high-ranking positions over the medium term, 

the ECB decided in 2013 to introduce gender targets. By the end of 2019 35% of positions at 

management level (heads of division, deputy heads of division, heads of section, senior advisers 

and advisers) as well as at senior management level (directors general, deputy directors general, 

directors and principal advisers) should be held by women. For senior management
-level positions 

taken alone, the target is 28%. At the end of 2013 the overall share of women in management
-level 
positions was 18%, while women held 15% of positions at senior management level. In order to 

reach the gender targets, the ECB is implementing a gender diversity action plan.RECRUITMENTThe ECB had 1,907 full-time equivalent permanent positions at the end of 2013, compared with 

1,450.5 positions at the end of 2012. The increase was mainly due to positions approved in 2013 
in relation to the establishment of the SSM. On 31 December 2013 recruitment was under way 

to fill the recently approved positions and the actual full-time equivalent number of staff holding 

employment contracts with the ECB was 1,790 (1,638 on 31 December 2012).
12 A total of 111 new 
fixed-term contracts (limited in nature or convertible to permanent contracts) were offered in 2013. 

By contrast, 28
 members of staff employed on a fixed-term or permanent basis left the ECB in 2013 

(34 in 2012), following resignation or retirement. Furthermore, to cover for absences of less than 

one year, 175 short-term contracts were issued during 2013 (in addition to a number of contract 
extensions), while 156 short-term contracts expired in the course of the year.Throughout 2013 the ECB continued to offer short-term contracts for periods of up to 36 months 
to staff from NCBs and international organisations. In particular, many colleagues joined the ECB 

in this context to assist in preparations for the SSM. On 31 December 2013 205 employees from 

NCBs and international organisations were working at the ECB on various assignments, 44% more 

than at the end of 2012.12 In addition to contracts based on full-time equivalent positions, this figure includes short-term contracts awarded to staff seconded from 
NCBs and international organisations and contracts awarded to Graduate Programme participants.184ECBAnnual Report
2013In September 2013 the ECB welcomed ten participants in the eighth intake of its Graduate 
Programme. These participants have various academic backgrounds and are each assigned to two 

different business areas for consecutive periods of one year each.As in previous years, traineeship opportunities were offered throughout the year to students and 
graduates with backgrounds in economics, statistics, business administration, law or translation. On 

31 December 2013 145 trainees were hosted by the ECB (19% more than in 2012). The ECB also 

awarded five fellowships as part of the Wim Duisenberg Research Fellowship Programme, which 
is open to leading economists, and five fellowships to young researchers under its Lamfalussy 
Fellowship Programme.PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENTIn 2013 ECB employees continued to benefit from internal mobility opportunities within the 

organisation. In the course of 2013 308 staff members, including 77 managers and advisers, moved 

internally to other positions, on either a temporary or a longer-term basis.The ECB, like all ESCB central banks, actively participates in the external mobility schemes 
promoted by the Human Resources Conference, which enables the ECB to second staff to the 
 28 NCBs in the EU or to relevant international organisations (e.g. the IMF and the BIS) for periods 

of two to twelve months. A total of 12 members of staff were seconded under this scheme in 2013 

(new cases). The total number of staff members on unpaid leave at the end of December 2013 

was 62 (compared with 56 in 2012). The ECB also launched a two-year career transition support 

programme in January 2013, so as to support staff members who have served the ECB in the same 

or similar positions for a prolonged period and who are interested in pursuing their career outside 

the ECB. It is foreseen that up to 50 staff members can be accepted for the programme by the end of 

2014. By the end of 2013 26 staff members had registered. The ECB continued to promote the acquisition and development of relevant skills and the further 
enhancement of the required competencies of management and staff. In addition to a range of 
 in-house training opportunities, management and staff continued to follow external training 

courses, including those offered under the ESCB training programme. In preparation for the SSM, 

several national competent authorities invited ECB staff to participate in ﬁhands-onﬂ study visits or 

dedicated training in the field of micro-prudential supervision.In 2013 22 deputy heads of division and 39 heads of section participated in a multi-source feedback 
exercise, in which their staff, peers and external counterparts completed a questionnaire on their 

managerial and leadership skills. Overall, the feedback was very positive. As a follow-up, these 

managers devised individual action plans to further enhance their performance.THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE 
The activities of the Human Resources Conference covered various aspects of human resources 

management in 2013, including the organisation of a broad range of ESCB training activities as 

well as intra-ESCB mobility. In 2013 there were 44 sessions of ESCB training activities, hosted by 

22 central banks.EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS 
The ECB™s employment conditions have been fine-tuned so as to continue offering an attractive 

package to staff, also in view of their generally high workload, and to balance the needs of staff 

with those of the organisation.185ECBAnnual Report2013At the end of 2013 228 staff members were working part time, 13% less than in 2012. The number 
of staff on unpaid parental leave as at 31 December 2013 was 26 (compared with 25 in 2012). 

In 2013, on average, around 491 staff members teleworked each month. In 2013 as a whole, 

1,280 staff members teleworked at least once.2.2 STAFF RELATIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUEThe ECB fully recognises the importance of a constructive dialogue with its staff. In 2013 the 

ECB consulted and exchanged information with the elected Staff Committee and the recognised 

trade union IPSO13 on changes related to remuneration, staffing provisions, staff development, 
performance management, working conditions, health and safety conditions and pension 

governance. In this context, 175 letters were exchanged. In addition, the ECB continued to have 
a frequent dialogue through regular meetings with the Staff Committee and IPSO on employment 

and social matters, and also ensured that staff were kept abreast of developments related to the 

establishment of the SSM. 2.3 ESCB SOCIAL DIALOGUE 
The ESCB Social Dialogue is a consultative forum involving the ECB, employee representatives 

from the central banks of the ESCB and representatives from European trade union federations.
14 Its purpose is to provide information and foster exchanges of views on issues that may have a major 

impact on employment conditions at the central banks of the ESCB. This information is provided in 

a biannual newsletter and at meetings held in Frankfurt.The first ESCB Social Dialogue meeting of 2013 took place in April in an extended format, with emphasis placed on topics linked to the SSM. Issues relating to banknote production and circulation, 

ESCB/Eurosystem training and mobility and market operations were also discussed.The second regular ESCB Social Dialogue meeting was held in November and focused on the 
main developments in the area of banking supervision. In this context, the adaptation of the ESCB 

Social Dialogue to adequately cater, in terms of employer and employee representation, for the 

establishment of the SSM was also addressed. Other issues discussed were ESCB/Eurosystem 

training and mobility, payment systems and banknotes.The ad hoc working group on banknote production and circulation continued to address technical 
issues, complementing the discussions held in the plenary meeting of the ESCB Social Dialogue. 

The working group on the ESCB Social Dialogue met in March and October 2013 and, among other 

things, identified possible items to be included in the agenda of the ESCB Social Dialogue meetings.2.4 THE EUROSYSTEM PROCUREMENT COORDINATION OFFICEThe objective of the Eurosystem Procurement Coordination Office (EPCO) is to ensure the efficient 

coordination of joint procurements of goods and services by those ESCB central banks that have 
13 IPSO stands for ﬁInternational and European Public Services Organisationﬂ.
14 The Standing Committee of European Central Bank Unions (SCECBU), Union Network International Œ Europa (UNI-Europa Finance) 
and the European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU).186ECBAnnual Report
2013committed to participating in EPCO™s activities, as well as to further improve the best procurement 
practices of these central banks. The network of central bank procurement experts, coordinated by 

EPCO, met six times in 2013.The 2013 update of the rolling EPCO Procurement Plan was implemented over the course of the 
year. The joint procedures on air transport for ESCB meetings and global hotel agreements were 

renewed. Several joint procurement procedures were finalised and new contracts implemented 

during 2013, in areas including market data services, audit services, banknote-related items and 

stationery products. In addition, EPCO progressed on five other joint procurement procedures 

in different domains, including market data services, information technology and banknote-

related products. Progress also continued to be made on studies to identify the potential for joint 

procurement in various areas such as insurance services, airlines and information technology. EPCO also prepared a handbook of best procurement practices and made it available to the EPCO 
central banks.EPCO™s activities during its first mandate were evaluated in 2013 in preparation for a decision on 
the possible extension of its mandate and its future operational set-up.2.5 NEW ECB PREMISESConstruction works for the new ECB premises continued in 2013, with the completion of the 

structural works for the 45 floors of the north tower and 43 floors of the south tower. The double 

office tower reached its final height of 185 m when the steel structures to house the technical areas 

were completed in March 2013. The antenna was installed shortly before Easter.The facade elements of the double office tower and of the atrium connecting the two towers were 
mounted in the course of 2013. The cranes were removed in January 2014, soon after the large air 

conditioning units had been installed in the technical areas located on the upper floors of the towers. 

By the end of 2013 work on the technical infrastructure and fit-out of the standard office floors had 

been partially completed. Some of the lifts became operational and were able to be used to transport 

materials and workers.Works also continued on the entrance building which will create a visual link between the 
Grossmarkthalle and the high-rise and clearly mark the main entrance to the ECB. The renovation 

of the concrete roof shells of the Grossmarkthalle was completed, while the restoration works in and 

around the western wing building continued. In parallel with the restoration works, the installation 

of the technical infrastructure and interior fit-out was carried out.The facades of the new internal structures for the conference area and the staff restaurant were 
completed. Considerable headway was also made on fitting out these areas, with the different 

interior spaces clearly taking shape. Meanwhile, the landscaping of the area surrounding the 

building ensemble progressed. The relocation of ECB staff is planned for the second half of 2014.187ECBAnnual Report20132.6 ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUESThroughout 2013 the ECB continued to strive to improve its environmental performance. 
 Its environmental policy was updated to better reflect the evolution and context of the organisation, 
while maintaining the emphasis on the minimisation of its ecological footprint and carbon 

emissions. In 2013 the ECB was re-awarded its environmental certification in accordance with 
 ISO 14001 and was re-registered under the EU™s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). 

The ECB continues to look for further ways in which to reduce its carbon footprint. It has also 

increased the scope of reporting and monitoring of its carbon emissions. The Governing Council decided to end the large-scale printing of the ECB™s Annual Report, and a 
similar print-run reduction was applied to all of the ECB™s official publications. The production of 

hard copies has been adjusted to the number of recipients who register online. Stocks of publications 

have also been drastically reduced and responsibly disposed of. The sustainable procurement guideline adopted in 2012 is increasing the number of products 
and services purchased with reference to sustainability criteria. In addition, in order to raise the 

environmental awareness of all staff, the ECB again organised a car-free day in 2013 during 

European Mobility Week.Finally, special attention is being paid to the establishment of state-of-the-art sustainability features 
in the operation and maintenance plans for the ECB™s new premises.2.7 I
NFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICE MANAGEMENT 
In 2013 the Directorate General Information Systems (DG/IS) supported the ECB™s core business 

with the provision of new Eurosystem solutions in the areas of statistics and market operations. 

Several application releases were provided for the management of the ECB™s foreign reserve assets, 

own funds, monetary policy operations and collateral. New initiatives were launched to strengthen 

the risk management framework and the ECB™s analytical capabilities, including new applications 

for supervisory data collection and reporting. In parallel, transversal systems for information, human 

resources and financial management underwent regular maintenance to improve the efficiency of 

the ECB™s administration.Work intensified in preparation for moving the IT infrastructure to the new ECB premises, and 
the ECB invested in both hardware (network and storage) and software (facility and data centre 

management). Additional workplaces and enhanced mobility services have been set up in 

preparation for the SSM. The IT infrastructure was reviewed in terms of operational stability and business continuity in 
2013, and initiatives were planned to simplify the existing infrastructure and strengthen technical 

and organisational resilience in the period 2014-16. These initiatives will also require further 

optimisation and additional controls with regard to DG/IS internal processes, the definition and 

implementation of which began in 2013.The exterior surface of the two office towers consists of a state-of-the-art ﬁshield hybrid facadeﬂ, which comprises three 
layers and is a refined synthesis of classic facade constructions, combining the functions of box windows, double-glazed 
windows and double facades. In order to meet various requirements relating to fire prevention, the reduction of radar 
reflection, the cleaning of the facades and sun protection, a special type of glazing was chosen, consisting of sun protection 

glass on the outside and thermal insulation glass on the inside. Aluminium blinds are also fitted between the two panes of 
glass to enhance the level of sun protection.189ECBAnnual Report2013ANNUAL ACCOUNTSMANAGEMENT REPORT FOR THE YEAR 
 ENDING 31 DECEMBER 20131 NATURE OF THE BUSINESSThe ECB™s activities in 2013 are described in detail in the relevant chapters of the Annual Report.2 OBJECTIVES AND TASKSThe ECB™s objectives and tasks are described in the Statute of the ESCB (Articles 2 and 3). An 
overview of performance against these objectives is included in the President™s foreword to the 
Annual Report.3 K
EY RESOURCES AND PROCESSESGOVERNANCE OF THE ECBThe Executive Board, the Governing Council and the General Council are the decision-making 
bodies of the ECB. In addition, the corporate governance of the ECB encompasses a high-level 

Audit Committee and a number of layers of internal and external controls, as well as two codes of 

conduct and an Ethics Framework.In order to further strengthen the corporate governance of the ECB and the Eurosystem, the Audit 
Committee provides assistance to the Governing Council as regards its responsibilities in respect of 

the integrity of financial information, the oversight of internal controls, compliance with applicable 

laws, regulations and codes of conduct, and the performance of the audit functions of the ECB and 

the Eurosystem.The Statute of the ESCB provides for two layers of external controls, namely the external auditors 
appointed to audit the annual accounts of the ECB (Article 27.1) and the European Court of 

Auditors, which examines the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB (Article
 27.2). In order to reinforce public assurance as to the independence of the ECB™s external auditors, 

the principle of audit firm rotation every five years is applied. In 2013 Ernst & Young GmbH 

Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was appointed as the external auditors of the ECB for the period to 

the end of the financial year 2017.In the context of the internal control structure of the ECB, an operational risk management 
framework is in place, whereby each organisational unit is responsible for managing its own 

operational risks and implementing its own controls, as well as for the effectiveness and efficiency 

of its operations. The Operational Risk Committee (ORC) supports the Executive Board in their 

oversight role regarding the management of the ECB™s operational risks. The ECB™s Directorate Risk Management is responsible for the risk management framework 
applicable to all of the ECB™s financial market operations and for monitoring, assessing and 
190ECBAnnual Report
2013proposing improvements to the Eurosystem™s operational framework for monetary policy and 
foreign reserves policy from a risk management perspective.Within the ECB™s internal control structure, responsibility and accountability for budget matters 
lies primarily with the individual business areas. The Budget, Controlling and Organisation 

Division (BCO) of the Directorate General HR, Budget and Organisation develops the framework 

for and prepares and monitors strategic planning in respect of the ECB™s resources, as well as the 

related operational budget, in cooperation with the business areas. BCO also provides planning and 

resource controlling, cost-benefit analysis and investment analysis for ECB and ESCB projects. 

Spending against agreed budgets is monitored regularly by the Executive Board, taking into account 

the advice of BCO, and by the Governing Council with the assistance of the Budget Committee 

(BUCOM), which is composed of ECB and euro area NCB experts. In accordance with Article 15 

of the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, BUCOM supports the Governing Council by providing a detailed 

evaluation of the ECB™s annual budget proposals and of requests for supplementary budget funding 

by the Executive Board, prior to their submission to the Governing Council for approval.In addition, independent audit missions are performed by the Directorate Internal Audit under the 
direct responsibility of the Executive Board.A comprehensive Ethics Framework for the staff of the ECB provides guidance and sets ethics 
conventions, standards and benchmarks. All staff are expected to maintain high standards of 

professional ethical behaviour in the performance of their duties, as well as in their relations with 

NCBs, public authorities, market participants, media representatives and the general public. Two 

additional codes of conduct deal exclusively with the ethical regime applicable to the members of 

the ECB™s decision-making bodies. The Ethics Officer appointed by the Executive Board ensures 

that the rules applicable to Executive Board members and staff are interpreted consistently. An 

Ethics Adviser has been appointed by the Governing Council to provide guidance to its members 

on aspects of professional conduct.Further information relating to the governance of the ECB is provided in Section 1 of Chapter 8 of 
the Annual Report.MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARDThe members of the Executive Board are appointed from among persons of recognised standing 

and professional experience in monetary or banking matters by the European Council, upon 

a recommendation from the EU Council after it has consulted the European Parliament and the 

Governing Council.The terms and conditions of members™ employment are determined by the Governing Council, 
based on a proposal from a committee comprising three members appointed by the Governing 

Council and three members appointed by the EU Council.Salaries, allowances and other benefits of the members of the Executive Board are set out in 
note 30, ﬁStaff costsﬂ, of the Annual Accounts.191ECBAnnual Report2013EMPLOYEESIn 2013 human resources management policies at the ECB focused on working culture, gender 
diversity, recruitment, professional development and employment conditions. Developments 

related to the working culture of the ECB continued to focus on professional ethics and performance 

management. With respect to the latter, the ECB implemented an ﬁunderperformance procedureﬂ 

which supports staff members who are required to restore their performance to at least a satisfactory 

level. Furthermore, the bank decided in 2013 to introduce gender targets and has put in place a 

gender diversity action plan, aimed at significantly increasing the proportion of women in high-

ranking positions over the medium term. The ECB continued to promote the acquisition and development of relevant skills and the further 
enhancement of the required competencies of management and staff. In January 2013 the ECB 

launched a two-year career transition support programme for staff members who have served the 

bank in the same or similar positions for a prolonged period and are interested in pursuing careers 

outside the ECB. Throughout 2013 intensive organisational preparations for the Single Supervisory 

Mechanism were under way. In this context, ECB staff participated in study visits and training 

courses offered by several national competent authorities.The average number of staff (full-time equivalents) holding contracts with the ECB
1 rose from 1,615 in 2012 to 1,683 in 2013. At the end of 2013 1,790 staff were employed. For further information, 
see note 30, ﬁStaff costsﬂ, of the Annual Accounts and Section 2 of Chapter 8 of the Annual Report 
which also describes developments in the area of human resources management in more detail.PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENTThe ECB holds two types of investment portfolio, namely the foreign reserves investment portfolio, 

denominated in US dollars and Japanese yen, and an own funds investment portfolio denominated 

in euro. In addition, the funds relating to the ECB™s pension plans are invested in an externally 

managed portfolio. The ECB also holds its share of securities for monetary policy purposes, 

acquired in the context of the Securities Markets Programme and the two covered bond purchase 

programmes. PRODUCTION OF THE ECB™S FINANCIAL ACCOUNTSPursuant to Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 

by the Executive Board, in accordance with the principles established by the Governing Council.2The Financial Reporting and Policy Division of the Directorate General Administration is 

responsible for producing the Annual Accounts in cooperation with other business areas and for 

ensuring that all related documentation is submitted in a timely manner to the auditors and thereafter 

to the decision-making bodies.The Directorate Internal Audit provides independent and objective assurance and consulting 
services designed to improve the ECB™s operations. In this context, financial reporting processes 

and the ECB™s Annual Accounts may be subject to internal audits. Internal audit reports, which 
1 Staff on unpaid leave are excluded. This number includes staff with permanent, fixed or short-term contracts and the participants in the 
ECB™s Graduate Programme. Staff on maternity or long-term sick leave are also included.2 See the notes on accounting policies.
192ECBAnnual Report
2013may include audit recommendations addressed to the business areas concerned, are submitted to the 
Executive Board.The ECB™s Assets and Liabilities Committee, which is composed of representatives from the ECB™s 
market operations, financial reporting, risk management and budget functions, systematically 

monitors and assesses all factors that may have a bearing on the ECB™s Balance Sheet and Profit 

and Loss Account. It reviews the Annual Accounts and the related documentation before they are 

submitted to the Executive Board for endorsement.Furthermore, the Annual Accounts of the ECB are audited by independent external auditors 
recommended by the Governing Council and approved by the EU Council. The external auditors 

examine the books and accounts of the ECB and have full access to all information about its 

transactions. The responsibility of the external auditors is to express an opinion as to whether the 

Annual Accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position of the ECB and of the results 

of its operations, in accordance with the principles established by the Governing Council. In this 

regard, the external auditors evaluate the adequacy of internal controls applied to the preparation 

and presentation of the Annual Accounts and assess the appropriateness of the accounting policies 

used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Executive Board.After the Executive Board has authorised their issuance, the Annual Accounts, together with the external auditors™ opinion and all relevant documentation, are submitted to the Audit Committee for 

review prior to their submission to the Governing Council for approval.The Executive Board has decided that from 2013 the ECB™s Annual Accounts will be approved 
at the second Governing Council meeting in February of each year and published immediately 

thereafter.4 RISK MANAGEMENTThe ECB is exposed to both financial and operational risks. Risk management is therefore a critical 

component of its activities and is conducted through a continuous process of risk identification, 

assessment, mitigation and monitoring.FINANCIAL RISKS Financial risks arise from the ECB™s core activities and capital allocation and, in particular, from 

the management of its (i) holdings of foreign reserves and gold, (ii) euro-denominated investment 

portfolios, and (iii) holdings of securities purchased for monetary policy purposes. They encompass 

credit, market and liquidity risks. The ECB decides its asset allocation and implements appropriate 

risk management frameworks, taking into account the objectives and purposes of the various 

portfolios and the financial exposures, as well as the risk preferences of its decision-making 

bodies. To ensure such preferences are met at all times, the ECB monitors and measures risks on a 

regular basis, takes appropriate risk mitigation actions when needed and regularly reviews its asset 

allocation as well as its risk management frameworks.Financial risks can be quantified using a variety of risk measures. In order to estimate such risks, 
the ECB applies risk estimation techniques developed in-house, which rely on a joint market 

and credit risk simulation framework. The core modelling concepts, techniques and assumptions 
193ECBAnnual Report2013underlying the risk measures are inspired by and reflect market standards.
3 In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of potential risk events that could occur at different frequencies with 
different degrees of severity, the ECB uses two types of statistical measure, Value at Risk (VaR) 

and Expected Shortfall,
4 which are calculated for a number of confidence levels. Furthermore, 
sensitivity and scenario analyses are used to better understand and complement the statistical risk 

estimates. Measured as VaR at a 95% confidence level over a one-year horizon (VaR95%), as at 31 December 
2013 the financial risks to which the ECB was exposed through its financial assets amounted to a 

total of •8.6 billion, representing a decrease in risks compared with the risk figures estimated as at 

31 December 2012 (•10.5 billion).5CREDIT RISK 6The ECB manages its credit risk, which comprises credit default and credit migration risks, 

mainly through systems of exposure limits and, in certain credit operations, also by means of 
collateralisation techniques. The risk controls and limits that the ECB uses to determine its credit 

risk exposure differ across types of operation, reflecting the policy or investment objectives of the 

different portfolios.The ECB™s foreign reserves holdings are subject to both credit default and credit migration risks. 
However, these risks are minimal, as the reserves are mainly held for the purposes of potential 

foreign exchange interventions and are therefore invested in assets with a high credit quality.The ECB™s holdings of gold are not subject to credit risk, as gold is not lent to third parties.
The purpose of the euro-denominated investment portfolio is to provide the ECB with income to 
help cover its operating expenses, while preserving the invested capital. Return considerations 

therefore play a relatively greater role in the asset allocation and risk control framework for these 

holdings than they do for the ECB™s foreign reserves. Notwithstanding, the credit risk in respect of 

these holdings is kept at moderate levels.The ECB™s exposures stemming from securities acquired within the scope of the two covered bond 
purchase programmes and the Securities Markets Programme are not likely to be affected by credit 

migration risk, as they are classified as held-to-maturity and are therefore not revalued at market 

prices. However, these exposures may be subject to credit default risk. In the case of the portfolios 

for the covered bond purchase programmes, credit default risk is kept at moderate levels through the 
3 Default and rating migration probabilities are derived from default and rating transition studies published by the major rating agencies. 
Volatilities, correlations and, more generally, the co-movement of credit and market risk variables are modelled by means of a multi-
factor copula approach, calibrated on the basis of historical data.4 Value at Risk (VaR) is defined as the maximum potential loss threshold for the portfolio of financial assets that, according to a statistical 

model, will not be exceeded with a given probability (confidence level) over a specified risk horizon. Expected Shortfall is a coherent risk 
measure that is more conservative than VaR when using the same horizon and the same confidence level, as it measures the probability-
weighted average losses that could occur in the worst-case scenarios that exceed the VaR threshold. Losses, in this context, are defined as 
differences between the net worth of the ECB™s portfolios as stated on the Balance Sheet at the beginning of the horizon, compared with 
simulated values at the end of the horizon.5 Risk estimates provided in this Management Report have been produced using a consistent set of methodologies, assumptions and input 

parameters for exposures measured as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013. Numerical differences between the risk estimates 
reported in this report for 31 December 2012 and those reported in the 2012 Annual Report of the ECB are due to methodological 
refinements.6 Credit default risk is defined as the risk of incurring financial losses owing to a ﬁdefault eventﬂ, which stems from the failure of an obligor 

(counterparty or issuer) to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner. In addition to credit default risk, a broad definition of credit 
risk encompasses credit migration risk, which is the risk of incurring financial losses owing to a repricing of financial assets following a 
significant deterioration in their credit quality and ratings. 194ECBAnnual Report
2013asset allocations, exposure limits and eligibility frameworks, which result in a diversified portfolio of 
covered bonds with a high credit quality. In the case of the Securities Markets Programme, the credit 

risk profile is determined by the allocation of purchases across countries, which is driven by monetary 

policy considerations. The resulting level of credit risk is within the tolerance levels of the ECB.MARKET RISK 7The main types of market risk to which the ECB is subject in managing its holdings are currency 

and commodity (gold price) risks.8 The ECB is also exposed to interest rate risk.9Currency and commodity risksThe ECB is exposed to currency risks and commodity risks owing to its holdings of foreign 

reserves and gold. Given the size of its exposure and the volatility of exchange rates and gold 

prices, currency and commodity risks dominate the ECB™s financial risk profile. In view of the policy role of gold and foreign reserves, described in Section 1.3 of Chapter 2 of the 
Annual Report, the ECB does not seek to eliminate currency and commodity risks. These risks are 

largely mitigated by the diversification of the holdings across different currencies and gold, even 

though the asset allocation is primarily driven by the potential need for policy interventions.The contributions of currency and commodity (gold price) risks dominate the ECB™s total risk 
profile. The bulk of the risks stems from the volatility of gold prices and of the US dollar exchange 

rate. In line with the Eurosystem rules, the gold and US dollar revaluation accounts, which 

amounted to •10.1 billion (2012: •16.4 billion) and •1.7 billion (2012: •3.3 billion) respectively 

as at 31 December 2013, can be used to absorb the impact of any future unfavourable movements 

in the prices of the underlying assets, thereby preventing any impact on the ECB™s Profit and Loss 

Account.The value of the ECB™s gold holdings depreciated sharply over the course of 2013, but the impact 
of this depreciation was entirely absorbed by the respective revaluation account. As a result of the 

depreciation, the market value of the ECB™s gold holdings has been reduced, leading to a decrease 

in currency and commodity risks.Interest rate riskSecurities acquired within the scope of the two covered bond purchase programmes and the 

Securities Markets Programme are classified as held-to-maturity and are therefore not revalued at 

market prices and are not exposed to interest rate risk. Conversely, the bulk of the ECB™s foreign reserves and euro-denominated investment portfolios is 
invested in fixed income securities which are revalued at market prices and are therefore exposed 

to interest rate risk. The interest rate risk arising from these portfolios is managed through asset 

allocation policies and market risk limits which ensure that the market risk remains contained at 

levels that reflect the ECB™s risk-return preferences for the different portfolios. When expressed in 

terms of the modified duration 10 of the fixed income portfolios, the different risk-return preferences 
7 Market risk is the risk of incurring financial losses owing to movements in market prices and interest rates that are not related to credit 
events.8 Currency risk is the risk of incurring financial losses on positions denominated in foreign currency, owing to fluctuations in exchange 
rates. Commodity risk is the risk of incurring financial losses on holdings of commodities, owing to fluctuations in their market prices.9 Interest rate risk is defined as the risk of incurring financial losses owing to a mark-to-market decline in the value of financial instruments 

as a result of adverse changes in applicable interest rates (yields).10 Modified duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the value of the portfolios to parallel shifts in yield curves.
195ECBAnnual Report2013result in a longer modified duration for the euro-denominated investment portfolio than for the 
foreign reserves holdings.The interest rate risk to which the ECB is exposed is limited and remained broadly stable at low 
levels over the course of 2013.LIQUIDITY RISK 11In view of the role of the euro as a major reserve currency, the ECB™s role as a central bank and its 

asset and liability structure, the only significant liquidity risk that the ECB is subject to is the risk of 

incurring financial losses owing to the inability to liquidate an asset at its prevailing market value 

within an appropriate time frame. In this regard, given the stability of the ECB™s portfolios and their 

distinct objectives, the ECB™s main exposure to liquidity risk stems from its foreign reserves, as, in 

order to carry out foreign exchange interventions, large amounts of these holdings may have to be 
liquidated within short periods of time.The liquidity risk in respect of the ECB™s foreign reserves is managed by establishing an asset 
allocation and limits which ensure that a sufficiently large share of the ECB™s holdings are invested 

in assets that can be liquidated quickly with a negligible impact on the price.The liquidity risk profile of the ECB™s portfolios remained broadly stable in 2013.OPERATIONAL RISK 
In the case of the ECB, operational risk is defined as the risk of a negative financial, business or 
reputational impact resulting from people,
12 the inadequate implementation or failure of internal 
governance and business processes, the failure of systems on which processes rely, or external 

events (e.g. natural disasters or external attacks). The operational risk management (ORM) 

framework covers all the activities of the ECB and is an integral part of the bank™s governance 

and management processes. The main objectives of ORM at the ECB are to provide reasonable 

assurance that the ECB will achieve its mission and objectives, as well as to protect its reputation 

and other assets against loss, misuse and damage.All risks are initially identified by the individual business areas. Each business area is assisted by the 
Operational Risk and Business Continuity Management Function team in handling all operational 

risk-related issues. The ECB has outlined potential root causes of risk, as well as risk events and 

the impacts which might arise from these causes. The ECB applies a defined risk life cycle which 

comprises a process of continuously and systematically identifying, analysing, responding to, 

reporting on and monitoring operational risk. The ECB has also put in place a risk tolerance policy 

which defines the level of operational risk it is prepared to tolerate. 11 In the case of the ECB, liquidity risk can be described as the possibility of incurring losses owing to the market™s inability to absorb large 
sell orders without a significant decline in the price.12 The term ﬁpeopleﬂ is used in a broad sense and covers any negative impact resulting from actions of the workforce, as well as from 
deficient personnel resourcing and personnel policies.196ECBAnnual Report
20135 FINANCIAL RESOURCESCAPITALUpon the accession of Croatia as a new EU Member State as at 1 July 2013 the NCBs™ capital key 
shares were adjusted and the subscribed capital of the ECB was increased to •10,825 million. In addition, Hrvatska narodna banka, in the same way as the other non-euro area NCBs, paid up 
3.75% of its subscribed capital as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB. Overall, as a 

result of the accession of Croatia as a new Member State, the ECB™s paid-up capital increased from 

•7,650 million on 30 June 2013 to •7,653 million on 1 July 2013. Details of these changes are provided in note 16, ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ, of the Annual Accounts.PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND GOLD PRICE RISKSSince most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities are periodically revalued at current market exchange 
rates and security prices, the ECB™s profitability is strongly affected by exchange rate exposures and, 

to a lesser extent, interest rate exposures. These exposures stem mainly from its holdings of gold 
and foreign reserve assets denominated in US dollars and Japanese yen, which are predominantly 

invested in interest-bearing instruments. The ECB™s investment portfolios and its holdings of 

securities purchased for monetary policy purposes entail a further exposure to credit risk.In view of its large exposure to these risks and the size of its revaluation accounts, the ECB 
maintains a provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks. The size 

of and continuing requirement for this provision is reviewed annually, taking a range of factors 

into account, including in particular the level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent of 

materialised risk exposures in the current financial year, projected results for the coming year and 

a risk assessment involving calculations of Values at Risk (VaR) on risk-bearing assets, which is 

applied consistently over time. The risk provision, together with any amounts held in the ECB™s 

general reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the capital paid up by the euro area NCBs.As at 31 December 2012 the provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold 
price risks amounted to •7,529 million. After taking the results of its risk assessment into account, 

the Governing Council decided to increase the size of the risk provision to •7,530 million as at 

31 December 2013. This amount equates to the value of the ECB™s capital paid up by the euro area 

NCBs as at 31 December 2013.6 FINANCIAL RESULT FOR 2013In 2013 the ECB™s net profit was •1,440 million (2012: •995 million)
 13 after a transfer to the risk provision of •0.4 million (2012: •1,166 million). Following this transfer and the retention 

of an amount of •9.5 million owing to an adjustment of the profits earned in previous years 

(see ﬁThe ECB™s pension plans, other post-employment benefits and other long-term benefitsﬂ 
13 As restated owing to a change in the accounting policies (see ﬁThe ECB™s pension plans, other post-employment benefits and other long-
term benefitsﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).197ECBAnnual Report2013in the notes on accounting policies) the remaining net profit, amounting to •1,430 million, was 
distributed to the euro area NCBs.The chart presents the components of the ECB™s Profit and Loss Account in 2013 and a comparison 
with 2012.In 2013 net interest income amounted to •2,005
 million, compared with •2,289
 million in 2012. 
The decrease in net interest income was mainly due to (a) the lower interest income on the ECB™s 

share of the total euro banknotes in circulation; and (b) the decrease in interest income generated 

on the securities purchased under the Securities Markets Programme and the two covered bond 
purchase programmes. The effects of these developments were in part offset by the lower interest 

expense arising from the euro area NCBs™ claims in respect of the foreign reserve assets transferred 

by them to the ECB.Net realised gains arising from financial operations decreased from •319
 million in 2012 to •52 million in 2013, owing mainly to lower realised price gains generated on the US dollar portfolio. 
In 2013 the overall decrease in the market value of securities held in the ECB™s US dollar 
portfolio resulted in substantially higher write-downs in that year, amounting to •115 million 
(2012: •4 million).Breakdown of the ECB™s Profit and Loss Account in 2013 and 2012(EUR millions)-1,500

2013As at the end of 2012 unrealised foreign exchange gains, mainly arising on the US dollar 
portfolio and the Japanese yen portfolio, amounted to •6,053 million and unrealised gold price 

gains amounted to •16,434 million. In 2013 the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the Japanese 

yen and the US dollar resulted in a decrease in unrealised foreign exchange gains, which fell to 
•2,540 million, and the fall in the price of gold during 2013 led to a decrease in unrealised gold 

price gains, which fell to •10,139
 million. In line with the Eurosystem™s accounting policies, these 

amounts were recorded in revaluation accounts.The total administrative expenses of the ECB, including depreciation, amounted to •527
 million in 
2013, compared with •464
 million in 2012. The vast majority of the costs incurred in connection 

with the construction of the ECB™s new premises have been capitalised and are excluded from

the ECB and the results of its operations. They have been drawn up in accordance with the following 

accounting policies,
2 which the Governing Council of the ECB considers to be appropriate to the 
nature of central bank activity.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been applied: economic reality and transparency, 

prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet events, materiality, going concern, the accruals 

principle, consistency and comparability.RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAn asset or liability is only recognised in the Balance Sheet when it is probable that any associated 

future economic benefit will flow to or from the ECB, substantially all of the associated risks and 

rewards have been transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of the asset or the amount of the 
obligation can be measured reliably.BASIS OF ACCOUNTINGThe accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis, modified to include the market 

valuation of marketable securities (other than those classified as held-to-maturity), gold and all 

other on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. 

Transactions in financial assets and liabilities are reflected in the accounts on the basis of the date 

on which they were settled.With the exception of spot transactions in securities, transactions in financial instruments 
denominated in foreign currency are recorded in off-balance-sheet accounts on the trade date. 

At the settlement date the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed and transactions are booked 
 on-balance-sheet. Purchases and sales of foreign currency affect the net foreign currency position 

on the trade date, and realised results arising from sales are also calculated on that date. Accrued 

interest, premiums and discounts related to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency 

are calculated and recorded daily, and the foreign currency position is also affected daily 
 by these accruals.GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into euro at the exchange 

rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are converted at the exchange rate 

prevailing on the recording date. The revaluation of foreign exchange assets and liabilities, including 

on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a currency-by-currency basis.1 The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in Decision ECB/2010/21 of 11 November 2010, OJ L 35, 9.2.2011, 
 p. 1, as amended.2 These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach to the 
rules governing the accounting and financial reporting of Eurosystem operations.204ECBAnnual Report
2013Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency is treated 
separately from the exchange rate revaluation.Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the year-end. No distinction is made between the 
price and currency revaluation differences for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is accounted for 

on the basis of the price in euro per fine ounce of gold, which, for the year ending
 31 December 2013, was derived from the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar on 31 December 2013.The special drawing right (SDR) is defined in terms of a basket of currencies. To revalue the ECB™s 
holdings of SDRs, the value of the SDR was calculated as the weighted sum of the exchange rates 

of four major currencies (the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound sterling) converted into euro 

as at 31 December 2013.SECURITIESMarketable securities (other than those classified as held-to-maturity) and similar assets are valued 

either at the mid-market prices or on the basis of the relevant yield curve prevailing on the balance 

sheet date, on a security-by-security basis. For the year ending
 31 December 2013, mid-market prices on 30 December 2013 were used.Marketable securities classified as held-to-maturity and illiquid equity shares are all valued at cost 
subject to impairment.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the period in which they are earned or incurred.
3 Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of foreign currency, gold and securities are taken to the Profit 
and Loss Account. Such realised gains and losses are calculated by reference to the average cost of 

the respective asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income but are transferred directly to a revaluation account.
Unrealised losses are taken to the Profit and Loss Account if, at the year-end, they exceed previous 
revaluation gains registered in the corresponding revaluation account. Such unrealised losses on 

any one security or currency or on gold are not netted against unrealised gains on other securities 

or currencies or gold. In the event of such unrealised loss on any item taken to the Profit and Loss 

Account, the average cost of that item is reduced to the year-end exchange rate or market price. 

Unrealised losses on interest rate swaps that are taken to the Profit and Loss Account at the year-

end are amortised in subsequent years.Impairment losses are taken to the Profit and Loss Account and are not reversed in subsequent 
years unless the impairment decreases and the decrease can be related to an observable event that 

occurred after the impairment was first recorded.Premiums or discounts arising on purchased securities, including those classified as held-to-
maturity, are calculated and presented as part of interest income and are amortised over the 

remaining life of the securities.3 A minimum threshold of •100,000 applies for administrative accruals and provisions.
205ECBAnnual Report2013REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase 
agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement 
to repurchase them from the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase 

agreements are recorded as collateralised deposits on the liability side of the Balance Sheet. 

Securities sold under such an agreement remain on the Balance Sheet of the ECB.Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous agreement 
to sell them back to the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date. Reverse repurchase 

agreements are recorded as collateralised loans on the asset side of the Balance Sheet but are not 

included in the ECB™s security holdings.Reverse transactions (including security lending transactions) conducted under an automated 
security lending programme are recorded on the Balance Sheet only where collateral is provided in 

the form of cash placed on an account of the ECB. In
 2013 the ECB did not receive any collateral in 

the form of cash in connection with such transactions.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 
exchange swaps and other currency instruments involving an exchange of one currency for another 

at a future date, are included in the net foreign currency position for the purpose of calculating 

foreign exchange gains and losses.Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation 
margin of open interest rate futures contracts are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account. The 

valuation of forward transactions in securities and of interest rate swaps is based on generally 

accepted valuation methods using observable market prices and rates, as well as discount factors 

from the settlement dates to the valuation date.POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTSThe values of assets and liabilities are adjusted for events that occur between the annual balance 

sheet date and the date on which the Executive Board authorises the submission of the ECB™s 

Annual Accounts to the Governing Council for approval, if such events materially affect the 

condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.Important post-balance-sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the 
balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes.INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM BALANCESIntra-ESCB balances result primarily from cross-border payments in the EU that are settled in 

central bank money in euro. These transactions are for the most part initiated by private entities 

(i.e. credit institutions, corporations and individuals). They are settled in TARGET2 Œ the Trans-

European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system Œ and give rise to bilateral 
206ECBAnnual Report
2013balances in the TARGET2 accounts of EU central banks. These bilateral balances are netted out 
and then assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving each NCB with a single net bilateral position 

vis-à-vis the ECB only. This position in the books of the ECB represents the net claim or liability of 

each NCB against the rest of the ESCB. Intra-Eurosystem balances of euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the 

ECB arising from TARGET2, as well as other intra-Eurosystem balances denominated in euro (e.g. 

interim profit distributions to NCBs), are presented on the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a single net 

asset or liability position and disclosed under ﬁOther claims within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ or ﬁOther 

liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ. Intra-ESCB balances of non-euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the 

ECB, arising from their participation in TARGET2,
4 are disclosed under ﬁLiabilities to non-euro 
area residents denominated in euroﬂ.Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem are 
included as a single net asset under ﬁClaims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the 

Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB by NCBs 
joining the Eurosystem are denominated in euro and reported under ﬁLiabilities equivalent to the 

transfer of foreign reservesﬂ.TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETSFixed assets, including intangible assets, but with the exception of land and works of art, are valued 

at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful 

life of the asset, beginning in the quarter after the asset is available for use. The useful lives applied 

for the main asset classes are as follows:The depreciation period for capitalised refurbishment expenditure relating to the ECB™s existing 
rented premises is adjusted to take account of any events that have an impact on the expected useful 

life of the affected asset. Land and works of art are valued at cost.Fixed assets costing less than •10,000 are written off in the year of acquisition.
Fixed assets that comply with the capitalisation criteria but are still under construction or 
development are recorded under the heading ﬁAssets under constructionﬂ. The related costs 

are transferred to the relevant fixed asset headings once the assets are available for use. For the 

depreciation of the ECB™s new premises, costs are assigned to the appropriate asset components 

which will be depreciated in accordance with their estimated useful lives.THE ECB™S PENSION PLANS, OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER LONG-TERM BENEFITSThe ECB operates defined benefit plans for its staff and Executive Board members. 
Computers, related hardware and software, and motor vehicles4 yearsTechnical equipment4 or 10 yearsFurniture and plant in building10 years207ECBAnnual Report2013The staff pension plan is funded by assets held in a long-term employee benefit fund. The compulsory 
contributions made by the ECB and the staff are
 18% and 6% of basic salary respectively and 
are reflected in the defined benefit pillar of the plan. Staff can make additional contributions on 

a voluntary basis in a defined contribution pillar that can be used to provide additional benefits.
5 These additional benefits are determined by the amount of voluntary contributions together with the 

investment returns arising from these contributions.Unfunded arrangements are in place for the post-employment and other long-term benefits of 
members of the Executive Board of the ECB. For staff, unfunded arrangements are in place for 

post-employment benefits other than pensions and for other long-term benefits. Revised accounting policyPrior to 2013 the ECB applied the so-called ﬁ10% corridorﬂ approach for recognising actuarial gains 
and losses on post-employment benefits, as provided for under International Accounting Standard 

(IAS) 19 ﬁEmployee benefitsﬂ. Under this approach, net cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains 

and losses on post-employment benefits which exceeded the greater of (a) 10% of the present 

value of the defined benefit obligation; and (b) 10% of the fair value of plan assets held against 

the defined benefit obligation, were amortised over the expected average remaining working lives 

of the participating employees. In addition, returns on plan assets held against the defined benefit 

obligation, which were recorded in the Profit and Loss Account, were calculated on the basis of the 

expected rate of return.Following the revision of IAS
 19, the option to apply the ﬁ10% corridorﬂ approach is no longer 
available. Consequently, in
 2013 the ECB decided that (a) remeasurements
6 of the net defined benefit liability in respect of post-employment benefits will be recognised in their entirety and 

shown in the Balance Sheet under ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ; and (b) interest on plan assets will be 

calculated by applying the discount rate. Thus, previously unrecognised actuarial losses, amounting 

to •146,603,113
 as at 31 December
 2012, are now included in the Balance Sheet under ﬁRevaluation 
accountsﬂ. These changes were applied retrospectively and the comparative amounts for
 2012 have been restated as follows:The Profit and Loss Account was adjusted retrospectively to reflect (a) the use of the discount rate 
for calculating the interest on plan assets held against the defined benefit obligation; and (b) the 

recognition under ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ of those actuarial gains and losses that were previously 
5 The funds accumulated by a staff member through voluntary contributions can be used at retirement to purchase an additional pension. 
This pension is included in the defined benefit obligation from that point on.6 An explanation of the new terminology is provided below.

2013amortised. The downward adjustment of the Profit and Loss Account for financial years prior 
to 2012, amounting to •6,479,000, is shown under ﬁOther assetsﬂ, while the profit for the year 
ending 31 December 2012 has been adjusted downwards by •3,024,000.7The cumulative adjustment of the Profit and Loss Account of •9,503,000, combined with the 

recognition of actuarial losses of •146,603,113, led to a net decrease of •137,100,113
 in the 
revaluation accounts.The Governing Council has decided to offset the cumulative adjustment of •9,503,000
 by reducing the amount to be distributed to the NCBs out of the net profit reported in 2013. The increase in ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ and the decrease in ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ reflect the previously 
unrecognised actuarial losses and the cumulative remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability 

as at 31 December 2012 respectively. The following terminology, stemming from the revised IAS 19, is used under the new rules: Net defined benefit liabilityThe liability recognised in the Balance Sheet under ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ in respect of the defined 
benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, 
less the fair value of plan assets used to fund the obligation.The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by discounting 

the estimated future cash flows using a rate which is determined by reference to market yields at 

the balance sheet date on high quality euro-denominated corporate bonds that have similar terms of 

maturity to the term of the pension obligation.Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience adjustments (where actual outcomes are 
different from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and changes in actuarial assumptions.Net defined benefit costThe net defined benefit cost is split into components reported in the Profit and Loss Account 

and remeasurements in respect of post-employment benefits shown in the Balance Sheet under 

ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ.The net amount charged to the Profit and Loss Account comprises:
(a) the current service cost of the defined benefits accruing for the year;
(b) net interest at the discount rate on the net defined benefit liability; and
(c) remeasurements in respect of other long-term benefits, in their entirety.7 This adjustment is reflected in the Profit and Loss Account under ﬁStaff costsﬂ.
209ECBAnnual Report2013Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liabilityThese comprise the following items:(a) actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligation;
(b)  the actual return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined 
benefit liability; and(c)  any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in the net interest on 
the net defined benefit liability.These amounts are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the appropriate liability in 

the financial statements.BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONThe ECB and the euro area NCBs, which together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro banknotes.
8 The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem central banks on the 

last working day of each month in accordance with the banknote allocation key.9The ECB has been allocated a share of
 8% of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, 
which is disclosed in the Balance Sheet under the liability item ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ. The 

ECB™s share of the total euro banknote issue is backed by claims on the NCBs. These claims, which 

bear interest,
10 are disclosed under the sub-item ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claims: claims related to the 
allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem 

balancesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies). Interest income on these claims is included in 

the Profit and Loss Account under the item ﬁInterest income arising from the allocation of euro 

banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ.INTERIM PROFIT DISTRIBUTIONThe ECB™s income on euro banknotes in circulation and income arising from securities purchased 

under the Securities Markets Programme is due to the euro area NCBs in the financial year in which 

it accrues. Unless otherwise decided by the Governing Council, the ECB distributes this income 

in January of the following year by means of an interim profit distribution.
11 It is distributed in 
full unless the ECB™s net profit for the year is less than its income earned on euro banknotes in 
circulation and securities purchased under the Securities Markets Programme, and subject to any 

decisions by the Governing Council to make transfers to the provision for foreign exchange rate, 

interest rate, credit and gold price risks. The Governing Council may also decide to charge costs 

incurred by the ECB in connection with the issue and handling of euro banknotes against income 

earned on euro banknotes in circulation.8 Decision ECB/2010/29 of 13 December 2010 on the issue of euro banknotes (recast), OJ L 35, 9.2.2011, p. 26, as amended.

2013OTHER ISSUESTaking account of the ECB™s role as a central bank, the Executive Board considers that the 
publication of a cash-flow statement would not provide the readers of the financial statements with 

any additional relevant information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB, and on the basis of a recommendation of 
the Governing Council, the EU Council has approved the appointment of Ernst & Young GmbH 

Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the external auditors of the ECB for a five-year period up to the 

end of the financial year 2017.211ECBAnnual Report2013NOTES ON THE BALANCE SHEET1 G
OLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLESAs at 31 December 2013 the ECB held 16,142,871 ounces
12 of fine gold (2012: 16,142,871 ounces). No transactions in gold took place in 2013. The decrease in the euro equivalent value of the ECB™s 
holdings of fine gold was due to the decline in the price of gold during 2013 (see ﬁGold and foreign 

currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies and note 15, ﬁRevaluation 

accountsﬂ).2 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY2.1 RECEIVABLES FROM THE IMFThis asset represents the ECB™s holdings of SDRs as at 31 December 2013. It arises as the result 

of a two-way SDR buying and selling arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 

whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange sales or purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf of the 

ECB, within minimum and maximum holding levels. For accounting purposes, SDRs are treated as 

a foreign currency (see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies).2.2 BALANCES WITH BANKS AND SECURITY INVESTMENTS, EXTERNAL LOANS AND OTHER EXTERNAL 

ASSETS; AND CLAIMS ON EURO AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCYThese two items consist of balances with banks and loans denominated in foreign currency, and 

investments in securities denominated in US dollars and Japanese yen.The decrease in these items in 2013 was mainly due to the depreciation of both the Japanese yen 
and the US dollar against the euro.12 This corresponds to 502.1 tonnes.Claims on non-euro area residents2013•2012•Change•Current accounts939,722,5011,503,909,190(564,186,689)Money market deposits1,001,428,468345,932,462655,496,006Reverse repurchase agreements87,738,38056,844,02030,894,360Security investments36,735,365,69038,763,272,753(2,027,907,063)Total 38,764,255,03940,669,958,425(1,905,703,386)Claims on euro area residents2013•2012•Change•Current accounts4,242,1151,189,4253,052,690Money market deposits1,266,550,6492,836,986,601(1,570,435,952)Total1,270,792,7642,838,176,026(1,567,383,262)212ECBAnnual Report

with an agreement on repurchase transactions established with the ECB. Under this agreement 

the non-euro area central bank can borrow euro against eligible collateral in order to support its 

domestic liquidity-providing operations.4 OTHER CLAIMS ON EURO AREA CREDIT INSTITUTIONS DENOMINATED IN EUROAs at 31 December 2013 this item consisted of current accounts with euro area residents.5 SECURITIES OF EURO AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN EURO5.1 SECURITIES HELD FOR MONETARY POLICY PURPOSESAs at 31 December 2013 this item consisted of securities acquired by the ECB within the scope of 

the two covered bond purchase programmes and the Securities Markets Programme.Purchases under the first covered bond purchase programme were completed by the end of 
June 2010, while the second covered bond purchase programme ended on 31 October 2012. 
 The Securities Markets Programme was terminated on 6 September 2012. The decrease in these 

items in 2013 was due to redemptions.Securities purchased under the Securities Markets Programme and the covered bond purchase programmes are classified as held-to-maturity securities and are valued on an amortised cost basis 
13 These holdings comprise assets minus liabilities denominated in the given foreign currency that are subject to foreign currency 
revaluation. They are included under the headings ﬁClaims on non-euro area residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, ﬁClaims on euro 
area residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, ﬁAccruals and prepaid expensesﬂ, ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents denominated 
in foreign currencyﬂ, ﬁOff-balance-sheet instruments revaluation differencesﬂ (liabilities side) and ﬁAccruals and income collected in

not affected the estimated future cash flows expected to be received by the ECB. Therefore, no 

losses were recorded for these securities in 2013.The Governing Council assesses on a regular basis the financial risks associated with the securities 
held under the Securities Markets Programme and the two covered bond purchase programmes.6 I
NTRA-EUROSYSTEM CLAIMS6.1 CLAIMS RELATED TO THE ALLOCATION OF EURO BANKNOTES WITHIN THE EUROSYSTEMThis item consists of the claims of the ECB vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs relating to the allocation 
of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies). The remuneration of these claims is calculated daily at the latest available marginal 

interest rate used by the Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing operations (see note 24.2, 
ﬁInterest income arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ).7 OTHER ASSETS7.1 TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETSThese assets comprised the following items on 31 December 2013:The increase in the category ﬁAssets under constructionﬂ was almost entirely due to activities 
related to the ECB™s new premises in 2013.The net increase in the cost of items in the category ﬁComputer hardware and softwareﬂ reflected 
acquisitions in 2013. These costs were only partially offset by the derecognition of obsolete items 

that were no longer in use at the end of December 2013. The derecognition of these items resulted 

in a net decrease in the accumulated depreciation in respect of this category.2013•2012•Change•CostLand and buildings170,824,151170,824,1510Computer hardware and software76,353,65964,633,29011,720,369Equipment, furniture, plant in building and motor vehicles13,818,95213,926,711(107,759)Assets under construction847,217,209529,636,881317,580,328Other fixed assets7,751,9537,508,349243,604Total cost1,115,965,924786,529,382329,436,542Accumulated depreciation

14 held as a direct counterpart to the 
capital and reserves of the ECB, as well as other financial assets which include 3,211
 shares in the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) at the acquisition cost of •41.8 million.The components of this item are as follows:The net increase in this item was due mainly to the investment in the own funds portfolio of 
 (a) the counterpart of the amount transferred to the ECB™s provision for foreign exchange rate, 
interest rate, credit and gold price risks in 2012; and (b) income generated on this portfolio in 2013.
7.3 OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION DIFFERENCESThis item is composed mainly of valuation changes in swap and forward transactions in foreign 

currency that were outstanding on 31 December 2013 (see note 21, ﬁForeign exchange swap and 

forward transactionsﬂ). These valuation changes are the result of the conversion of such transactions 

into their euro equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, compared with 

the euro values resulting from the conversion of the transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency on that date (see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ and ﬁGold and foreign currency 

assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).Valuation gains on outstanding interest rate swap transactions are also included in this item 
(see note 20, ﬁInterest rate swapsﬂ).7.4 ACCRUALS AND PREPAID EXPENSESIn 2013 this item included accrued coupon interest on securities, including outstanding interest paid 

at acquisition, amounting to •708.3 million (2012: •792.7 million) (see note 2.2, ﬁBalances with 

banks and security investments, external loans and other external assets; and Claims on euro area 

residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, note 5, ﬁSecurities of euro area residents denominated 

in euroﬂ, and note 7.2, ﬁOther financial assetsﬂ).It also included accrued interest receivable on the TARGET2 balances due from euro area NCBs for 
the final month of 2013, amounting to •155.1 million (2012: •650.4 million), and accrued interest 

receivable on the ECB™s claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem 

for the final quarter of the year (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting policies), 

amounting to •69.2 million (2012: •136.7 million).14 Repurchase agreements conducted in the context of the management of the own funds portfolio are reported under ﬁSundryﬂ on the

(a) balances related to swap and forward transactions in foreign currency outstanding on 
 31 December 2013 that arose from the conversion of such transactions into their euro 
equivalents at the respective currency™s average cost on the balance sheet date, compared 

with the euro values at which the transactions were initially recorded (see ﬁOff-balance-sheet 

instrumentsﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).(b) a claim against the German Federal Ministry of Finance in respect of recoverable value added 

tax and other indirect taxes paid. Such taxes are refundable under the terms of Article 3 of the 
Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Union, which applies to the ECB by 

virtue of Article 39 of the Statute of the ESCB.(c) the cumulative adjustment of the Profit and Loss Account for the financial years prior to 2013, 

owing to the change in the accounting policy for post-employment benefits (see ﬁThe ECB™s 

pension plans, other post-employment benefits and other long-term benefitsﬂ in the notes on

in order to provide the ECB with collateral in respect of the EBA™s payments settled through the 

TARGET2 system.10 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN EUROAs at 31 December 2013 this item included an amount of •24.6 billion (2012: •44.0 billion), 

consisting of balances held with the ECB by non-euro area NCBs and other central banks that arise 

from, or are the counterpart of, transactions processed via the TARGET2 system.216ECBAnnual Report
2013The remainder of this item comprised an amount of •0.2 billion (2012: •6.8 billion) arising from 
the temporary reciprocal currency arrangement with the Federal Reserve.
15 Under this arrangement, 
 US dollars are provided by the Federal Reserve to the ECB by means of swap transactions, with the 

aim of offering short-term US dollar funding to Eurosystem counterparties. The ECB simultaneously 

enters into back-to-back swap transactions with euro area NCBs, which use the resulting funds 

to conduct US dollar liquidity-providing operations with Eurosystem counterparties in the form 

of reverse transactions. The back-to-back swap transactions result in intra-Eurosystem balances 

between the ECB and the NCBs. The swap transactions conducted with the Federal Reserve and the 

euro area NCBs also result in forward claims and liabilities that are recorded in off-balance-sheet 

accounts (see note 21, ﬁForeign exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ).11 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY11.1 D
EPOSITS, BALANCES AND OTHER LIABILITIESIn 2013 this item consisted of a liability that arose under a repurchase agreement conducted with 

a non-euro area resident in connection with the management of the foreign currency reserves 
 of the ECB.12 I
NTRA-EUROSYSTEM LIABILITIES12.1 LIABILITIES EQUIVALENT TO THE TRANSFER OF FOREIGN RESERVESThese represent the liabilities to the euro area NCBs that arose from the transfer of foreign reserve 
assets to the ECB when they joined the Eurosystem.15 In January 2014 the Governing Council decided, in view of the considerable improvement in US dollar funding conditions and the 
low demand for US dollar liquidity-providing operations, to gradually reduce its offering of such operations (see the press release of 
 24 January 2014).Since 1 July 2013•As at 31 December 2012•Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique1,401,024,4151,397,303,847Deutsche Bundesbank10,871,789,51510,909,120,274Eesti Pank103,152,857103,115,678Central Bank of Ireland643,894,039639,835,662Bank of Greece1,129,060,1701,131,910,591Banco de España4,782,873,4304,783,645,755Banque de France8,190,916,3168,192,338,995Banca d™Italia7,218,961,4247,198,856,881Central Bank of Cyprus77,248,74078,863,331Banque centrale du Luxembourg100,776,864100,638,597Central Bank of Malta36,798,91236,407,323De Nederlandsche Bank2,298,512,2182,297,463,391Oesterreichische Nationalbank1,122,511,7021,118,545,877Banco de Portugal1,022,024,5941,008,344,597Banka Slovenije189,499,911189,410,251398,761,127399,443,638Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank721,838,191722,328,205Total40,309,644,42540,307,572,893217ECBAnnual Report2013The enlargement of the EU through the accession of Croatia, and the concomitant adjustment of 
the total limit of NCBs™ claims and weightings in the ECB™s capital key (see note 16, ﬁCapital and 

reservesﬂ), led to an increase of •2,071,532 in these liabilities.The remuneration of these liabilities is calculated daily at the latest available marginal interest rate 
used by the Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing operations, adjusted to reflect a zero 

return on the gold component (see note 24.3, ﬁRemuneration of NCBs™ claims in respect of foreign 

reserves transferredﬂ).12.2 OTHER CLAIMS/LIABILITIES WITHIN THE EUROSYSTEM (NET)In 2013 this item consisted mainly of the TARGET2 balances of the euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the 

ECB (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies). 

The ECB had a net claim vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs at the end of 2012. This net claim turned into 

a net liability at the end of 2013 mainly owing to the settlement in TARGET2 of payments from 

non-euro area residents to euro area residents (see note 10, ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents 

denominated in euroﬂ). The reduction in the outstanding amounts related to back-to-back swap 

transactions conducted with NCBs in connection with US dollar liquidity-providing operations 

also contributed to the elimination of the net claim and the creation of the net liability in 2013. 
 The impact of these two factors was partially offset by redemptions of securities purchased under 

the Securities Markets Programme that were settled via TARGET2 accounts.The remuneration of TARGET2 positions, with the exception of balances arising from back-to-
back swap transactions in connection with US dollar liquidity-providing operations, is calculated 

daily at the latest available marginal interest rate used by the Eurosystem in its tenders for main 

refinancing operations.This item also included the amount due to euro area NCBs in respect of the ECB™s interim profit 
distribution (see ﬁInterim profit distributionﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).13 OTHER LIABILITIES13.1 OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION DIFFERENCESThis item is composed mainly of valuation changes in swap and forward transactions in foreign 

currency that were outstanding on 31 December 2013 (see note 21, ﬁForeign exchange swap and 

forward transactionsﬂ). These valuation changes are the result of the conversion of such transactions 

into their euro equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, compared with 

the euro values resulting from the conversion of the transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency on that date (see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ and ﬁGold and foreign currency 

assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).2013•2012•Due from euro area NCBs in respect of TARGET2(687,997,098,717)(981,081,428,771)Due to euro area NCBs in respect of TARGET2686,747,265,644955,833,285,908Due to euro area NCBs in respect of the ECB™s interim profit distribution1,369,690,567574,627,292Other (claims)/liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)119,857,494(24,673,515,571)218ECBAnnual Report

ﬁInterest rate swapsﬂ).13.2 ACCRUALS AND INCOME COLLECTED IN ADVANCEAs at 31 December 2013 the two main items under this heading were, first, accrued interest 

payable to the NCBs for the whole of 2013 in respect of their claims relating to foreign reserves 

transferred to the ECB (see note 12.1, ﬁLiabilities equivalent to the transfer of foreign reservesﬂ), 

amounting to •192.2 million (2012: •306.9 million), and, second, accrued interest payable 

on TARGET2 balances due to NCBs for the final month of 2013, amounting to •155.8 million 
 (2012: •641.1 million). These amounts were settled in January 2014. Accruals on financial 

instruments and other accruals are also reported in this item.Also included under this heading is a contribution to the ECB from the City of Frankfurt of 
 •15.3 million for the preservation of the Grossmarkthalle, which is a listed building, in connection 
with the construction of the ECB™s new premises. This amount will be netted against the cost of the 

building once it is available for use (see note 7.1, ﬁTangible and intangible fixed assetsﬂ).13.3 SUNDRYIn 2013 this item included outstanding repurchase transactions of •480.4 million (2012: 
 •360.1 million) conducted in connection with the management of the ECB™s own funds (see note 7.2, 
 ﬁOther financial assetsﬂ).It also included balances related to swap and forward transactions in foreign currency outstanding 
on 31 December 2013 that arose from the conversion of such transactions into their euro equivalents 

at the respective currency™s average cost on the balance sheet date, compared with the euro values 

at which the transactions were initially recorded (see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ in the notes 

on accounting policies).THE ECB™S PENSION PLANS, OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER LONG-TERM BENEFITSIn addition, this item included the ECB™s net liability in respect of the post-employment and other 

long-term benefits of its staff and the members of the Executive Board, amounting to •131.9 million. 

Amounts for 2012 have been restated owing to the change in the applicable accounting policy 
 (see ﬁThe ECB™s pension plans, other post-employment benefits and other long-term benefitsﬂ in 

the notes on accounting policies). The amounts recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of post-employment and other long-term 
employee benefits were as follows:2013Staff2013Executive Board 2013Total2012Staff2012ExecutiveBoard2012Total• millions• millions• millions• millions• millions• millionsPresent value of obligation650.617.8668.4677.817.8695.6Fair value of plan assets(536.5)-(536.5)(439.3)-(439.3)Net defined benefit liability recognised in the Balance Sheet114.117.8131.9238.517.8256.3219ECBAnnual Report2013Prior to 2013 the fair value of plan assets included the assets that were accumulated as a result of 
voluntary contributions made by staff in a defined contribution pillar. In 2013 the value of these 

assets amounted to •96.5 million (2012: •83.5 million). These assets give rise to a corresponding 

obligation of an equal value which is included in the present value of the obligation. For 
presentational reasons, the tables in 2013 only show the amounts relating to the defined benefit 

pillar and the comparative figures for 2012 have been adjusted accordingly. Consequently, the 

reported values for the closing obligation and the closing fair value of plan assets in 2012 decreased 

to •695.6 million and •439.3 million respectively.In 2013 the present value of the obligation vis-à-vis staff of •650.6 million (2012: •677.8 million) included unfunded benefits amounting to •109.4 million (2012: •109.1 million) relating to 
 post-employment benefits other than pensions and to other long-term benefits. Unfunded 

arrangements are also in place for the post-employment and other long-term benefits of members of 

the Executive Board.The amounts recognised in the Profit and Loss Account in 2013 were as follows:The current service cost increased in 2013 to •47.3 million (2012: •30.3 million), primarily owing 
to the reduction in the discount rate from 5.00% in 2011 to 3.50% in 2012.16Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows:The remeasurement gains of •104.3 million for 2013 on the defined benefit obligation vis-à-vis 
staff arose primarily owing to the lower conversion factors applied for the calculation of future 

pension payments, as well as the increase in the discount rate from 3.50% in 2012 to 3.75% in 2013.

2013The remeasurement losses of •139.6 million for 2012 on the defined benefit obligation vis-à-vis 
staff arose primarily owing to the decrease in the discount rate from 5.00% in 2011 to 3.50% in 

2012. The resulting increase in the closing obligation was only partially offset by the impact of a 

reduction in the expected future increase in the guaranteed benefits, which is based on unit price 

developments, as well as the impact of a reduction in the assumed future increase in pensions from 

1.65% to 1.40%.Benefits paid in 2012 included the settlement of pension rights of some members of the Executive 
Board who left the ECB.Changes in 2013 in the fair value of plan assets in the defined benefit pillar relating to staff were as 
follows:17Remeasurement gains on plan assets in both 2013 and 2012 reflected the fact that actual returns on 

the fund units were higher than the estimated interest income on plan assets.In line with the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European Central Bank, a long-term 
 valuation of the ECB™s staff pension plan was carried out by the ECB™s actuaries as at 
31 December 2011. Following this valuation, and acting on actuarial advice, the Governing Council 
approved on 2 August 2012 an annual supplementary contribution of •10.3 million, to be paid for a 

period of twelve years starting in 2012. This decision will be reviewed in 2014. In preparing the valuations referred to in this note, the actuaries have used assumptions which 
the Executive Board has accepted for the purposes of accounting and disclosure. The principal 

assumptions used for the purposes of calculating the benefits scheme liability are as follows:17 In previous years amounts paid by the ECB for post-employment benefits other than pensions and for other long-term benefits were included under the items ﬁContributions paid by employerﬂ and ﬁBenefits paidﬂ. These amounts are not included in these items in the figures for 2013, as unfunded arrangements are in place for these benefits. The comparative figures for 2012 have been adjusted accordingly.2013• millions2012• millionsOpening fair value of plan assets439.3347.5Interest income on plan assets15.818.0Remeasurement gains39.833.7Contributions paid by employer33.231.9Contributions paid by plan participants12.311.5Benefits paid(3.9)(3.3)Closing fair value of plan assets536.5439.320132012%%Discount rate3.753.50Expected return on plan assets 1)4.754.50General future salary increases 2)2.002.00Future pension increases 3)1.401.401)  These assumptions were used for calculating the part of the ECB™s defined benefit obligation which is funded by assets with an 
underlying capital guarantee.2)  In addition, allowance is made for prospective individual salary increases of up to 1.8% per annum, depending on the age of the plan 
participants.3)  According to the ECB™s pension plan rules, pensions will be increased annually. If general salary adjustments for ECB employees were 
below price inflation, any increase in pensions will be in line with the general salary adjustments. If the general salary adjustments 
exceed price inflation, they will be applied to determine the increase in pensions, provided that the financial position of the ECB™s 
pension plans permits such an increase.221ECBAnnual Report201314 PROVISIONSThis item consists of a provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks 
as well as other miscellaneous provisions.The provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks will be used to the 
extent deemed necessary by the Governing Council to offset future realised and unrealised losses, 

in particular valuation losses not covered by the revaluation accounts. The size of and continuing 

requirement for this provision is reviewed annually, based on the ECB™s assessment of its exposure 

to these risks. This assessment takes a range of factors into account, including in particular the 

level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent of materialised risk exposures in the current 

financial year, projected results for the coming year, and a risk assessment involving calculations of 

Values at Risk (VaR) on risk-bearing assets, which is applied consistently over time. The provision, 

together with any amount held in the general reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the ECB™s 

capital paid up by the euro area NCBs.As at 31 December 2012 the provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price 
risks amounted to •7,529,282,289. Taking the results of its assessment into account, the Governing 

Council decided to transfer, as at 31 December 2013, an amount of •386,953 to the provision. This 

transfer reduced the ECB™s net profit for 2013 to •1,439,769,100 and increased the size of the 

provision to •7,529,669,242. Following the increase in the ECB™s paid-up capital in 2013 (see
 note 16, 
 ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ), this amount corresponds to the value of the ECB™s capital paid up by the 

euro area NCBs as at 31 December 2013.15 REVALUATION ACCOUNTSThis item consists mainly of revaluation balances arising from unrealised gains on assets, liabilities 

and off-balance-sheet instruments (see ﬁIncome recognitionﬂ, ﬁGold and foreign currency assets 

and liabilitiesﬂ, ﬁSecuritiesﬂ and ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies). It also includes the remeasurements of the ECB™s net defined benefit liability in respect 

of post-employment benefits (see ﬁThe ECB™s pension plans, other post-employment benefits and 

other long-term benefitsﬂ in the notes on accounting policies and note 13.3 ﬁSundryﬂ).The foreign exchange rates used for the year-end revaluation were as follows:2013•2012•Change•Gold10,138,805,09716,433,862,811(6,295,057,714)Foreign currency2,540,202,5586,053,396,675(3,513,194,117)Securities and other instruments674,356,531984,781,810(310,425,279)Net defined benefit liability in respect of post-employment benefits4,825,887(137,100,113)141,926,000Total13,358,190,07323,334,941,183(9,976,751,110)Exchange rates20132012US dollars per euro1.37911.3194Japanese yen per euro144.72113.61Euro per SDR1.11831.1657Euro per fine ounce of gold871.2201,261.179222ECBAnnual Report
201316 CAPITAL AND RESERVES16.1 CAPITAL(A) CHANGE TO THE ECB™S CAPITAL KEYPursuant to Article 29 of the Statute of the ESCB, the shares of the NCBs in the ECB™s capital key 
are weighted according to the shares of the respective Member States in the EU™s total population 

and GDP in equal measure, as notified to the ECB by the European Commission. These weights are 

adjusted every five years and whenever new Member States join the EU. Based on Council Decision 2003/517/EC of 15 July 2003 on the statistical data to be used for the 
adjustment of the key for subscription to the capital of the European Central Bank,
18 the NCBs™ 
capital key shares were adjusted on 1 July 2013, upon the accession of Croatia as a new Member 

State, as follows:18 OJ L 181, 19.7.2003, p. 43.Capital key since 1 July 2013%Capital key as at 31 December 2012 %Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique2.41762.4256Deutsche Bundesbank18.760318.9373Eesti Pank0.17800.1790Central Bank of Ireland1.11111.1107Bank of Greece1.94831.9649Banco de España8.25338.3040Banque de France14.134214.2212Banca d™Italia12.457012.4966Central Bank of Cyprus0.13330.1369Banque centrale du Luxembourg0.17390.1747Central Bank of Malta0.06350.0632De Nederlandsche Bank3.96633.9882Oesterreichische Nationalbank1.93701.9417Banco de Portugal1.76361.7504Banka Slovenije0.32700.32880.68810.6934Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank1.24561.2539Subtotal for euro area NCBs69.558169.97050.86440.86861.45391.4472Danmarks Nationalbank1.47541.4835Hrvatska narodna banka0.5945-Latvijas Banka0.27420.2837Lietuvos bankas0.40930.4256Magyar Nemzeti Bank1.37401.3856Narodowy Bank Polski4.85814.89542.44492.4645Sveriges Riksbank2.26122.2582Bank of England14.432014.5172Subtotal for non-euro area NCBs30.441930.0295Total100.0000100.0000223ECBAnnual Report2013(B) CAPITAL OF THE ECBIn accordance with Article 48.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, the ECB™s subscribed capital is 
automatically increased when a new Member State joins the EU and its NCB joins the ESCB. 

The increase is determined by multiplying the prevailing amount of the subscribed capital 
 (i.e. •10,761 million as at 30 June 2013) by the ratio, within the expanded capital key, between 

the weighting of the entering NCB(s) and the weighting of those NCBs that are already members 

of the ESCB. Therefore, on 1 July 2013 the subscribed capital of the ECB was increased to 
 •10,825 million.The non-euro area NCBs are required to pay up 3.75% of their share in the ECB™s subscribed capital 
as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB. Therefore, as at 1 July 2013 Hrvatska narodna 

banka paid an amount of •2,413,300. Including this amount, the total contribution of non-euro area 

NCBs amounted to •123,575,169 as at that date. The non-euro area NCBs are not entitled to receive

between banknote printing works and NCBs, for the delivery of new banknotes, and between NCBs, 
for the compensation of shortages with surplus stocks. These costs are borne centrally by the ECB.2 Staff on unpaid leave are excluded. This number includes staff with permanent, fixed or short-term contracts and the participants in the

the following order:(a) an amount to be determined by the Governing Council, which may not exceed 20% of the net 
profit, shall be transferred to the general reserve fund, subject to a limit equal to 100% of the 

capital; and (b) the remaining net profit shall be distributed to the shareholders of the ECB in proportion to

fund of the ECB and, if necessary, following a decision by the Governing Council, against the 
monetary income of the relevant financial year in proportion and up to the amounts allocated to the 

NCBs in accordance with Article 32.5 of the Statute of the ESCB.1After the transfer to the risk provision, the ECB™s net profit for 2013 was •1,439.8 million. 
Following a decision by the Governing Council, there was no transfer to the general reserve fund 

and an interim profit distribution, amounting to •1,369.7 million, was paid out to the euro area 

NCBs on 31 January 2014. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to retain an amount of 

•9.5 million, owing to adjustments to profits earned in previous years (see ﬁThe ECB™s pension 

plans, other post-employment benefits and other long-term benefitsﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies), and to distribute the remaining profit of •60.6 million to the euro area NCBs. Profits are distributed to the NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the subscribed capital

use of a new opening mechanism which is ﬁhiddenﬂ behind the outer facade and supplies the offices with fresh air through 
the ventilation slots that it creates.Extensive repair work has been carried out on the brick facades of both wing buildings of the Grossmarkthalle. Any bricks 
that were damaged have been replaced with those collected during the removal of the annexe buildings. All the joints of the 

brickwork have been raked out and, in keeping with architect Martin Elsaesser™s original design, filled with a pale mortar 
for the horizontal joints and a dark mortar for the vertical joints.The concrete grid facades on the northern and southern sides of the Grossmarkthalle have been carefully repaired and 
cleaned. All the windows, with a few exceptions, have been replaced by new ones consisting of steel frames that are as 
narrow as the old ones, but strong enough to support double glazing.237ECBAnnual Report2013ANNEXES1 LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ADOPTED BY THE ECBThe following tables list the legal instruments that were adopted by the ECB in 2013 and early 2014

and detailed glossary can be found on the ECB™s website.Balance of payments (b.o.p.): a statistical statement that summarises, for a specific period of time, 
the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The transactions considered 

are: those involving goods, services and income; those involving financial claims on, and liabilities 

to, the rest of the world; and those (such as debt forgiveness) that are classified as transfers.Banking union: one of the building blocks for completing 
Economic and Monetary Union, which consists of an integrated financial framework with a single rulebook, a 
Single Supervisory 
Mechanism, common deposit protection and a single bank resolution mechanism.
Central counterparty (CCP): an entity that interposes itself, in one or more markets, between the 
counterparties to the contracts traded, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every 
buyer and thereby guaranteeing the performance of open contracts.Central government: the government as defined in the European System of Accounts 1995
, but excluding regional and local governments (see also general government).Central securities depository (CSD):
 an entity that: (i) enables securities transactions to 

be processed and settled by book entry, (ii) provides custodial services (e.g. the administration

form (whereby they exist only as electronic records).Collateral: assets pledged or otherwise transferred (e.g. by credit institutions to central banks) as 
a guarantee for the repayment of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. by credit institutions to central 
banks) under repurchase agreements.Comprehensive assessment: an assessment of the banking system in the Member States participating in the 
Single Supervisory Mechanism
. The assessment, carried out by the ECB in 
cooperation with the national competent authorities of the participating Member States, is to be 

concluded before the ECB assumes its supervisory responsibilities. It comprises a supervisory risk 

assessment, an asset quality review and a stress test. The objective is to foster transparency, repair 

balance sheets where needed and enhance confidence in the banking sector.Correspondent central banking model (CCBM):
 a mechanism established by the 
European System of Central Banks
 with the aim of enabling 
counterparties to use eligible collateral in a cross-border context. In the CCBM, NCBs act as custodians for one another. This means that each NCB has a securities account in its securities administration for each of the other NCBs and the 

ECB.Counterparty: the opposite party in a financial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with a central 
bank).Covered bond purchase programme (CBPP):

euro area, in support of a specific financial market segment that is important for the funding of 

banks and was particularly affected by the financial crisis. The purchases under the programme 
254ECBAnnual Report
2013were for a nominal value of •60 billion, and they were fully implemented by 30
 June 2010. On 6 October 2011 the Governing Council decided to launch a second covered bond purchase

market prices. It is the subject of one of the fiscal criteria laid down in Article
 126(2) of the Treaty to define the existence of an excessive deficit (see also excessive deficit procedure).Deficit (general government):
 the general government
™s net borrowing, i.e. the difference 
between total government revenue and total government expenditure.Deficit-debt adjustment (general government):
 the difference between the

 one pillar of the ECB™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis 
of the risks to price stability
, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary 
policy decisions. The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of current economic 

and financial developments and the implied short to medium-term risks to price stability from the 

perspective of the interplay between supply and demand in goods, services and factor markets 

at those horizons. Due attention is paid to the need to identify the nature of shocks affecting the 

economy, their effects on cost and pricing behaviour, and the short to medium-term prospects for 

their propagation in the economy (see also monetary analysis).Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a committee which contributes to the preparation 

of the work of the ECOFIN Council and the European Commission. Its tasks include reviewing 

the economic and financial situation of both the Member States and the EU, and contributing to 

budgetary surveillance.Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the process that led to the single currency, the euro, and the single monetary policy in the

the ten non-euro area EU Member States and ten trading partners outside the EU) and the EER-40 
 (composed of the EER-20 and 20 additional countries). The weights used reflect the share of each 

partner country in the euro area™s trade in manufactured goods and account for competition in 

third markets. Real EERs are nominal EERs deflated by a weighted average of foreign, relative to 

domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measures of price and cost competitiveness.EONIA (euro overnight index average):
 a measure of the effective interest rate prevailing in 
the euro interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest rates 

on unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by a panel of

traded on stock exchanges (quoted shares), unquoted shares and other forms of equity. Equities 

usually produce income in the form of dividends.ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II):
 a mechanism which provides the framework for 
exchange rate policy cooperation between the 
euro area countries and the non-euro area EU 
Member States. ERM II is a multilateral arrangement with fixed, but adjustable, central rates and 

a standard fluctuation band of ±15%. Decisions concerning central rates and, possibly, narrower 

fluctuation bands are taken by mutual agreement between the EU Member State concerned, the 

euro area countries, the ECB and the other EU Member States participating in the mechanism. All 

participants in ERM II, including the ECB, have the right to initiate a confidential procedure aimed 

at changing the central rates (realignment).256ECBAnnual Report

assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled. The ECB publishes a calendar of the 

reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of the year.260ECBAnnual Report
2013Marginal lending facility: a standing facility
 of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use to receive overnight credit from an NCB at a pre-specified interest rate against eligible assets 
(see also key ECB interest rates).Market risk: the risk of losses (in both on and off-balance-sheet positions) arising from movements 
in market prices.Maximum bid rate: the upper limit to the interest rates at which 
counterparties may submit bids in variable rate liquidity-absorbing tender operations.MFIs (monetary financial institutions):
 financial institutions which together form the money-
issuing sector of the euro area. These include the 
Eurosystem, resident credit institutions (as defined in EU law) and all other resident financial institutions whose business is to receive 

deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for their own 

account (at least in economic terms), to grant credit and/or invest in securities. The latter group 

consists predominantly of 
money market funds, i.e. funds that invest in short-term and low-risk 
instruments, usually with a maturity of one year or less.Minimum bid rate: the lower limit to the interest rates at which 
counterparties may submit bids in variable rate liquidity-providing tender operations.Monetary analysis:
 one pillar of the ECB™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis 
of the risks to price stability
, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary 
policy decisions. The monetary analysis helps to assess medium to long-term trends in inflation, 

in view of the close relationship between money and prices over extended horizons. The monetary 

analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of monetary indicators, including M3, 
its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures of excess liquidity (see
 also 
economic analysis).Monetary income: income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the 
Eurosystem™s monetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with guidelines established 

by the Governing Council and held against banknotes in circulation and deposit liabilities to 
credit 
institutions.Money market: the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded, using instruments which generally have an original maturity of up to and including one year.Non-standard measures:
 temporary measures taken by the 
Governing Council to support the effectiveness of interest rate decisions and their transmission to the wider 
euro area economy in 
the context of a dysfunctional situation in some financial market segments and the financial system 

more broadly.OFIs (other financial intermediaries):
 corporations or quasi-corporations (other than insurance 
corporations or pension funds) that are engaged mainly in financial intermediation by incurring 
liabilities in forms other than currency, deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from 

institutional entities other than 
MFIs. OFIs include in particular corporations engaged primarily in 

long-term financing (such as financial leasing), securitised asset holdings, other financial holdings, 

securities and derivatives dealing (on their own account), venture capital and development capital.261ECBAnnual Report2013Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in the financial 
market. With regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, 
Eurosystem open market operations 
can be divided into four categories: main refinancing operations; longer-term refinancing 
operations; fine-tuning operations
; and structural operations. As for the instruments used, 
reverse transactions are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed in all 

four categories of operation. In addition, the issuance of debt certificates and outright transactions 

are available for structural operations, while outright transactions, foreign exchange swaps and the 

collection of fixed-term deposits are available for the conduct of fine-tuning operations.Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs):
 transactions that aim to safeguard an appropriate 
monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy in the 
euro area
 through 
purchases of euro area government bonds in the secondary market based on strict and effective 
conditionality.Over-the-counter (OTC) trading: 
a method of trading that does not involve a regulated market. 
 In over-the-counter markets, such as those for OTC derivatives, participants trade directly with 
each other, typically through telephone or computer links.Price stability:
 the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the 
Eurosystem. The Governing Council defines price stability as a year-on-year increase in the 
Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices
 for the euro area of below 2%. The Governing Council has also made it clear 
that, in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over 

the medium term.Projections: the results of exercises conducted four times a year to project possible future 
macroeconomic developments in the 
euro area. Eurosystem staff projections are published 
in June and December, whereas ECB staff projections are published in March and September. 
 They form part of the economic analysis
 pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB and are 
thus one of several inputs into the Governing Council™s assessment of the risks to price stability.Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system:
 a settlement system in which processing and 

settlement take place on a transaction-by-transaction basis in real time (see also TARGET).Reference value for M3 growth:
 the annual growth rate of 
M3 over the medium term that is 

consistent with the maintenance of 
price stability
. At present, the reference value for annual M3 

growth is 4½%.Repurchase agreement: the process of borrowing money by combining the sale of an asset 
(usually a fixed income security) with the subsequent repurchase of that same asset on a specified 

date for a slightly higher specified price (which reflects the borrowing rate).Reserve base:
 the sum of the eligible balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) that constitute 
the basis for calculating the reserve requirement of a credit institution.Reserve requirement: the minimum amount of reserves a credit institution is required to hold 
with the 
Eurosystem over a predefined 
maintenance period
. Compliance with the requirement 
is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balances in the reserve accounts over the 

maintenance period.262ECBAnnual Report
2013Reverse transaction:
 an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a 
repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.Securities Markets Programme (SMP):
 a programme for conducting interventions in the 
euro area public and private debt securities markets to ensure depth and liquidity in dysfunctional 
market segments with a view to restoring an appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism. 

The SMP was terminated when the technical features of the 
Outright Monetary Transactions 
were announced on 6 September 2012.Securities settlement system (SSS): a system which allows the transfer of securities, either free of 
payment or against payment (delivery versus payment).Securitisation: the pooling of financial assets, such as residential mortgage loans, and their 
subsequent sale to a special-purpose vehicle, which then issues fixed income securities for sale to 

investors. The principal and interest of these securities depend on the cash flows produced by the 

pool of underlying financial assets.Settlement risk: the risk that settlement in a transfer system will not take place as expected, usually 
owing to a party defaulting on one or more settlement obligations. This risk includes, in particular, 

operational risks, credit risks and liquidity risks.Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM): a mechanism proposed by the European Commission, 

which establishes uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions 

established in the banking union
. It is envisaged that it will be composed of a single resolution 

board and national resolution authorities in participating Member States, with ultimate decision-

making power at the European level. For the purposes of resolution, the SRM will have at its 

disposal a single resolution fund. The SRM is a necessary complement to the 
Single Supervisory 
Mechanism in order to achieve a well-functioning banking union. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM): 
a mechanism composed of the ECB and national 
competent authorities in participating Member States for the exercise of the supervisory tasks 

conferred upon the ECB. The ECB will be responsible for the effective and consistent functioning 

of this mechanism, which will form part of the banking union.Stability and Growth Pact (SGP): intended to serve as a means of safeguarding sound government 

finances in the EU Member States in order to strengthen the conditions for 
price stability
 and for 
strong, sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. The SGP has two arms Œ a preventive 

arm and a corrective arm. The preventive arm prescribes that Member States specify medium-term 

budgetary objectives, while the corrective arm contains concrete specifications on the 
excessive 
deficit procedure. Standing facility:
 a central bank credit facility available to 
counterparties at their own initiative. The Eurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the 
marginal lending facility
 and the deposit facility.Straight-through processing (STP): the automated end-to-end processing of trades/payment 

transfers Œ including, where relevant, the automated completion of confirmation, matching and 

generation of orders, clearing and settlement.263ECBAnnual Report2013Structural fiscal balance (general government)
: the actual budget balance corrected for cyclical 
factors (i.e. the cyclically adjusted balance) and one-off fiscal measures.Systemic risk: the risk that the inability of one participant to meet its obligations in a system will 
cause other participants to be unable to meet their obligations when they become due, potentially 

with spillover effects (e.g. significant liquidity or credit problems) threatening the stability of or 

confidence in the financial system. That inability to meet obligations can be caused by operational 

or financial problems.TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer 
system): the Eurosystem™s real-time gross settlement system
 for the euro. The first-generation 
TARGET system was replaced by TARGET2 in May 2008.TARGET2: the second-generation 
TARGET system. It settles payments in euro in central bank 

money and functions on the basis of a single shared IT platform, to which all payment orders are 

submitted for processing.TARGET2-Securities (T2S): the Eurosystem™s single technical platform enabling 
central securities depositories and NCBs to provide core, borderless and neutral securities settlement 
services in central bank money in Europe.Treaties: unless stated otherwise, all references in this report to the ﬁTreatiesﬂ refer to both the 
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty on European Union.
Treaty: unless stated otherwise, all references in this report to the ﬁTreatyﬂ refer to the Treaty on 
the Functioning of the European Union, and the references to article numbers reflect the numbering 
in effect since 1 December 2009.Treaty of Lisbon (Lisbon Treaty): amends the EU™s two core treaties: the Treaty on European 
Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community. The latter has been renamed the 

Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Treaty of Lisbon was signed in Lisbon on 

13 December 2007 and entered into force on 1 December 2009.Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (TSCG): an intergovernmental treaty, which was signed in Brussels on 2
 March 2012 and entered into force on 1 January 2013. It contains a ﬁfiscal compactﬂ, which complements and, in some 

areas, enhances key provisions of the 
Stability and Growth Pact. Inter alia, it requires the Member 

States having ratified this Treaty to enshrine in national law a balanced budget and increases the 

role of independent fiscal monitoring bodies.
