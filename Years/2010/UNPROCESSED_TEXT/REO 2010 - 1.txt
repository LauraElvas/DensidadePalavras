 vii Executive Summary  A moderate and uneven recovery is ta
king shape across Europe, supported by the rebound in global trade and policy stimulus. Europe™s performance remains weak compared 

with the recoveries underway in other parts of
 the world; these differences largely reflect the legacy of the economic and financial crisis, which affected Europe more than other regions. 
The varying speed of recovery in advanced Europe, where many southern European 

economies continue to struggle, is closely linked to the degree of overheating and credit expansion going into the crisis. The even more varied speed of recovery in the economies of emerging Europe reflects country-specific vulnerabilities, external financing difficulties, and variations in their reliance on export demand. Inflationary pressures are subdued in advanced 
economies; but in emerging Europe, with its gr
eater differences in exchange rate regimes and economic structures, the picture is again more mixed. 
 Unprecedented and often synchronized policy actions helped prevent a financial and 
economic meltdown and continue to support the upswing. Fiscal policy protected aggregate 

demand and private consumption from the full impact of the shock through discretionary 
stimulus and automatic stabilizers. An array of emergency monetary and financial measures 
averted a cascade of bank failures and contained systemic financial risk. In the most 

vulnerable and hard hit countries in emerging Europe, coordinated assistance from the IMF, 
the European Union (EU), and other multilateral institutions eased the inevitable adjustment to considerably tighter constraints on externa
l financing. Large and front-loaded official financing measures allowed for more gradual corrections in the current account and 

smoother policy adjustments than would have been possible otherwise. 
 Growth is expected to pick up during 2010Œ11
, but the traditional drivers of the recovery 
are likely to be weaker than usual. In the near term, growth will continue to benefit from exports, fiscal support (including from lagged stimulus measures such as infrastructure 

investment), and an upswing in inventories. Improvements in investor and consumer confidence should raise domestic demand. However, with unemployment expected to 
increase, and with lingering difficulties in the 
banking sector likely to restrain credit supply, 
consumption and investment will remain lackluster.  Risks to the overall outlook appear broadl
y balanced. On the downside, market concerns 
about sovereign liquidity and solvency in Greece, if unchecked, could turn into a larger sovereign debt crisis, potentially leading to some contagion. Another downside risk is a 
commodity price shock that could lead central banks to raise interest rates sooner than 
expected. In emerging Europe, where investors 
increasingly differentiate between countries, some might see healthy capital flows returning later than expected, while others could face a 

destabilizing surge of inflows. On
 the upside, growth could be significantly higher across all 
of Europe if the continued dynamism of activity in the United States and in Asian and Latin 
American emerging economies boosts trade.  
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY viii 
 Although supportive macroeconomic policies ar
e still needed to secure a self-sustaining recovery, the costs and limits of many crisis interventions are of growing concern. Such concerns are most prominent on the fiscal side, but they exist as well for monetary and 
financial policies. Aiming to stabilize public debt in the short run is neither feasible nor desirable, given the risk of a relapse into recession and the magnitude of the required fiscal 
retrenchment. However, sustainability indicators are flashing warning signs about the public debt in most countries, and sizable consolidation efforts are needed in the medium term. 
Although the required adjustments are not necessarily unprecedented, they often exceed 

current fiscal adjustment plans. For countrie
s with already low fiscal credibility, more immediate consolidation is a must. In the monetary and financial areas, the onset of exit from crisis support reflects preestablished sunset clauses and normalized market conditions, 

which reduce the attractiveness of many emergency facilities. However, the persistence of blanket crisis measures in the financial sector still allows some banks to postpone restructuring and thereby prolongs underlying fragilities. Blanket guarantees and liquidity 
support must be gradually replaced by specific interventions in individual institutions.  Spillovers across policy areas and countries require the coordination and sequencing of 
the exit from crisis policiesŠparticularly in the EU and the euro area. Without a coordinated 
approach, the withdrawal of enhanced deposit guarantees would trigger opportunistic capital 

flows in the EU™s tightly integrated markets. Across policy areas, eliminating remaining 
banking sector problems will help normalize credit conditions, enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, and aid the fiscal exit. The need for coordination is particularly great in the 

euro area, where cross-border and cross-policy spillovers are intertwined. Here, existing frameworks like the Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Stability and Growth Pact can be 
helpful, for example by serving as common anchors to medium-term plans for adjustment 

and exit in line with the principles endorsed
 by the G-20. However, the Greek crisis is a powerful reminder of long-standing gaps in the area™s fiscal architecture. Filling those gaps 
will require a substantial strengthening of fiscal discipline in good times and the introduction 
of procedures to manage crises. 
 For emerging Europe, the key policy challeng
e will be attracting and harnessing healthy capital inflows to restore economic growth (Chapter 2). After a long period of relatively large and seemingly unstoppable inflows, the region saw capital inflows decelerate as the crisis 
took hold. The differential impact of the crisis
 across countries reflected variations in the factors that attracted excessive foreign capital be
fore the crisis. In general, the countries hit 
the most had precrisis inflows that were the most in excess of what can be explained by 
structural factors, such as the degree of income convergence or the size and structure of 

their economies. Their economies often had features that tended to create the illusion of 
fiscal spaceŠheavily managed exchange rates, booming credit markets, and overheated 
growth. As policymakers became increasingly worried about vulnerabilities associated with EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ix the surge of flows, they often resorted to prudential policies that were somewhat effective in 
moderating the size and composition of those flows.  These precrisis trends provide a number of
 important policy lessons. For countries that 
are already seeing a resumption of inflows, responsive macroeconomic policies will be 
critical to stemming an excessive surge. For countries with pegged exchange rates, the best 
response to inflows in excess of those driven by structural factors is to tighten fiscal policies. For countries without pegged exchange rates, the most effective response could be to let the currency appreciate. A freely floating exchange 
rate is also helpful in preventing excessive inflows and the accumulation of financial fragilities. 
 These macroeconomic policies should be acco
mpanied by improvements in the financial 
stability of the increasingly integrated financial system in the region. Prudential tools such as capital requirements on foreign borrowing help 
to lower excessive inflows and related risks in banks. Higher risk weights on loans to certain sectors help build buffers in the banking 

system and prevent overheating of certain sectors. To sustain the resilience of the financial system, these tools need supportive macroeconomic policies and effective cross-border 
financial supervision.  Where capital inflows conducive to income 
convergence have yet to resume, policymakers 
will need to reorient the sources of economic growth toward the tradables sector. While this 
transformation would take place in the private sector, it will require support from policies to 
restore a balance between the nontradables and 
tradables sectors, improve intersectoral labor 
mobility, reduce skill mismatches, and address country-specific infrastructure bottlenecks.  
  1 1. Outlook: Getting the Exit Right 
  Across Europe, unprecedented policy actions are shoring 
up a moderate and uneven recovery. In the very near term, 

policies must push to establish a firm recovery. However, in 

some countries, fiscal stimulus has already collided with 

sustainability concerns. In any case, the tasks ahead include a 

large medium-term fiscal consol
idation. Equally crucial is the 
quick return to normal financia
l intermediation that will come 
through rapid restructuring and recapitalization of vulnerable 
institutions, clarification of the regulatory environment, and 

moving away from blanket support to the financial sector. 

Such normalization should allow monetary policy to regain 

traction. Many countries need to boost competitiveness and 

rebalance their sources of growth. For emerging economies, the 

challenges are more varied. Reforms encouraging healthy 

capital inflows would help restart the convergence of real 
incomes. Recovery in Low Gear 
A Moderate and Uneven Pickup in Activity 
 In the global multispeed recovery, European 
growth overall remains in low gear, and a number of 

countries were still mired in recession at the 

beginning of 2010, incl
uding Greece, Latvia, Romania, and Spain. This weak performance relative 
to the rebound in other part
s of the world reflects to 
a significant extent the legacy of the crisis, which 

affected Europe more than other regions. 

Heightened insecurity among households, impaired 

financial intermediation, and the gradual 

deleveraging of private bala
nce sheets are likely to 
weigh on private demand for some time. 
 The particularly large 
impact of the crisis on 
Europe relative to other regions not only revealed 

the strength of the financial linkages between the 

United States and Europe but also the reliance of 

Europe™s key economiesŠparticularly GermanyŠ

on external demand as the engine of growth. The 

interconnectedness of European economies led to a 

rapid transmission of the collapse in global trade and 

capital flows. In a number of countries, the effect of 

the external shock was magnified by homegrown 

vulnerabilities, including real estate bubbles, credit 
booms (for instance, in Ireland, Latvia, Russia, 
Spain, and the United Kingdom), and excessive 
government borrowing (as in Greece and Hungary). 
 Three factors at play before the crisis seem to 
have determined the magnitude of the growth 

collapse in 2009 across a br
oad sample of European and non-European countries: (1) a rapid expansion 
of credit to the private sector; (2) above-trend 
output (signaling overheating); and (3) current 

account imbalances, with 
surplus countries being affected more than deficit countries, everything else 

equal (Figure 1).
1 These factors suggest that the sharpness of the contraction reflected either internal 

imbalancesŠunsustainable domestic growth fed by 

credit boomsŠor external onesŠreliance on 

exports as a source of growth. One important 
moderating factor at work during the crisis was 
automatic fiscal stabilizers. As tax payments fell with 

national income, the existence of social safety nets 

shielded disposable income, and thereby 

consumption, from the full effects of the shock. The 

size of automatic stabilizers
 in Europe is typically larger than elsewhere.
2 Moreover, significant and 
timely discretionary stimulus in countries that had a 

relatively strong fiscal position prior to the crisis 
helped smooth the downswing. 
 Signs of recovery emerged in the second half of 
2009 (Figure 2). In the euro area, higher net exports

were hard hit, but an econometr
ic analysis suggests that the 
growth shock in those cases was primarily due to credit booms 

and overheating rather than the external deficit as such.

and public spending, combined with the stabilization 
of inventories, produced a moderate increase in real 
GDP. The gain ended an unprecedented series of 

five consecutive quarters of declining output. 

However, the rebound remains dependent on 

temporary factors, including restocking and policy 

measures. For instance, the 2009 withdrawal of car 

scrapping subsidies in Germany (August) and Italy 
(December) and the planned winding down of them 

in France and Spain through 2010 dampened already

3 to uneven policy responses. In particular, the legacy 
of external financing difficulties and the associated 

restrictive macroeconomic policies continue to 

affect domestic demand in Hungary, Latvia, and 
Romania, where output is ba
rely starting to pick up or is still contracting. In contrast, Estonia, the 

Slovak Republic, and Turkey are rebounding 

vigorously, partly because their strong policy 

performance before the crisis gave them greater 

room for maneuver. And Po
land appears to have 
escaped recession altogether. In Russia, the rise in 

net exports resulting fr
om import compression 
helped put an end to the sharp contraction in real 

GDP by the second quarter of 2009, while expansionary macroeconomic policies provided 
support in the second half. Ukraine™s GDP 

bottomed out in the second quarter of 2009 after a 

particularly acute contraction, but a clear trend in 

activity remains to be established there. 
 The improving economic fundamentals and a 
return of risk appetite am
ong investors are visible in the strong and broad-based rebound in financial 
markets from their troughs in early 2009 (Figure 3). 

The improvement is particul
arly sharp in emerging 
Europe. Equity prices there recouped their crisis-

induced losses; and a recove
ry in government bond 
prices, in line with high-grade equivalents in 

advanced Europe, sent yields down. In the euro 

area, stock prices have also gone a long way toward 
recouping their losses in the wake of the Lehman 
Brothers bankruptcy; yield 
curves have continued to 
steepen; and the functioning of money markets has 

improved, with interbank rates in the euro area now 

within the corridor delimited by the lending and 

deposit facilities of the European Central Bank 

(ECB) (Figure 4). The steady narrowing of spreads 

of corporate bond rates over monetary policy rates 

since the second quarter of 2009 is improving the 
prospect for nonbank financing of larger 
creditworthy companies, which typically have easier 

access to market financing.  However, concerns about sovereign solvency and 
liquidity in Greece grew rapidly early this year, 

raising fears of contagion 
to other vulnerable euro area sovereigns. These concerns have dented 

investors™ appetite for the government bonds of 

these countries, for shares of exposed banks, and 

potentially for broader risk taking. As a result, stock 

prices softened and sovereign spreads for euro area countries of concern edged higher; for Greece, 

sovereign spreads shot up dramatically for 10-year 

bonds and even more so for shorter maturities.
3 These developments and the related shift toward a 
mix of tight fiscal policy and easy monetary policy 
sent the euro down sharply vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar 

and other major currencies.  
The Traditional Drivers of Recovery 
Are Likely to Be Weaker than Usual 
 Against this background, the central forecast 
envisages a moderate and uneven pickup in activity 

in 2010, with more significant growth momentum in 
2011 (Table 1). In the euro
 area, forecasted real 
GDP growth reaches 1 percent in 2010 and 1.5 percent in 2011, with the 2011 performance led

Other large euro-area economies are set to emerge 

more slowly from the recession, notably Italy; and 

Spain is seen as still cont
racting in 2010. Outside the 
euro area, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and 

Denmark follow a pattern similar to that in the 

overall euro-area forecast, although with somewhat 
stronger momentum. Russia and other non-EU 
emerging economies are expected to sustain the 

strong upturn initiated in the second half of 2009, but growth in emerging EU countries is tempered 

by the moderate pace of recovery in advanced 

economies and the legacy of the crisis in the most 

affected countries. By 2011, however, a more 

dynamic growth pattern and a resumption of 

convergence in real incomes should emerge in the 
wake of financial market normalization, a gradual 
return of healthy capital flows (see Chapter 2), 
improved confidence, and greater room for 
maneuver on the policy side. 
  The unevenness of the recovery reflects country-
specific legacies of the crisis, including its disparate 
effects on financial sectors, and the varying 
responsiveness of individual economies to external 

demand. A systematic look reveals that several 
important factors are shaping the pattern of real 

GDP growth for 2010 (Figure 5). The first is the 

inherent dynamics of stabilization, which imply that 

the sharp growth decelerations in 2009 will tend to 

be followed by a stronger expected pickup (or a 

slower decline) in 2010. But external demand also 
plays a key role in the early stages of a recovery. 
Specifically, countries that exhibited a current 

account surplus in 2007Špointing to strong export performanceŠon average seem better positioned to
OUTLOOK: GETTING THE EXIT RIGHT 
5   grow than do countries that recorded a deficit and 
relied more on domestic demand for growth. 

Finally, the relative importance of bank credit 

appears to be a moderating force on short-term 

growth prospects. Two underlying developments are 
likely to be at work behind that result: binding 

constraints on credit supply, which tend to affect 

countries to the degree that they rely on bank 

financing; and a more forceful deleveraging in 

economies that experienced a 
boom in bank credit

 prior to the crisis. The negative correlation between 
bank credit and expected growth is consistent with 

the historical pattern in which the upturn after an 

acute financial crisisŠespecially if the crisis was 

globally synchronizedŠtends to be more moderate 
than the rebound after a typical recession (IMF, 
2009d).  One implication is that the recovery is likely to 
hinge on global demand. In the near term, growth 

could still benefit from an upswing in inventories 

and from the lagged impact of specific fiscal stimulus measures such as 
infrastructure investment. 
High-frequency indicators of economic activity 

(Figure 6) currently support the projection of a 

moderate expansion at an annual pace of 

1½ percent in the euro area, with the typically 

outward-oriented manufacturing sector showing 

greater dynamism than the typically inward-oriented 

service sector. The dichotomy in growth prospects 

between these sectors is another indication that the 
recovery still largely depends on external demand 
and that domestic sources of growth remain 

subdued. While that dichotom
y is not unusual in the early stages of European recoveries, a rise in 

confidence among investors and consumers will 
need to be sustained if dome
stic spending is to play its role as the main engine of growth. In the 

assumptions of the baseli
ne scenario, investment 
rebounds from exceptionally low levels (Figure 7), 
while private consumption growth initially remains 
subdued.  Another factor influencing the speed of the 
recovery is credit growth. Although the current 

weakness in credit growth results from a 

combination of demand and supply factors, supply-
side factors become more binding as the recovery 
firms up (Figure 8). Already, anecdotal and survey-

based evidence of credit rationing (especially for 

small and medium-sized enterprises) and emerging signs of disintermediation in corporate financing in 

the euro area make it difficult to completely rule out

Sep-09 a credit crunch. Such evidence reflects the ongoing 
deleveraging process, with banks diverting resources 
from normal lending to build liquidity buffers and 

prepare for the expected tightening of regulatory 

capital requirements. Moreover, many banks face 

additional write-downs from impaired assets and 

loan losses linked to the deep recession. As a consequence, limited credit supply is likely to 

constrain the expected pickup in investment and 
durables™ consumption, thereby preventing a more 
dynamic recovery. The argument is particularly 

relevant for two groups of countries: those in which 

nonbank financing is traditionally less developed; 

and those in which significant segments of the 

banking sector are still ailing (for example, 

Germany™s 
Landesbanken
 and Spain™s 
Cajas
) and likely to remain heavily dependent on public assistance 

until adequate restructuring, consolidation, and 
recapitalization are completed. Also, continued 
weakness in house prices could hold back 

consumption and further constrain credit growth. 
 Indeed, a ﬁcreditlessﬂ recovery of the kind 
documented by Claessens, Kose, and Terrones 

(2009) and by Abiad, Dell™Ariccia, and Li 
(forthcoming) appears unlikely in the current 
European context. Such recoveries typically feature 

an early pickup in private consumption that offsets 

the negative effect of scarce credit on investment. 

That scenario presupposes a rapid liquidation of

  households™ precautionary buffers (Figure 9) that 
current conditions do not encourage. Specifically, 
the prospect of rising or persistent unemployment 

increases insecurity among those currently employed 

and signals poor prospects for the unemployed 

(Figure 10). Unfavorable conditions prevail across 

widely different labor markets, including dynamic 

settings like the United King
dom™s; dual structures like Spain™s; and more rigid environments like 

Germany™s, where substantial labor hoardingŠ
subsidized or voluntaryŠcould either unwind or 
depress job creation (see IMF, 2009b, Box 1). In 

addition, households™ disposable income and their 

propensity to spend will be 
affected by large fiscal adjustments with some combination of higher taxes, 
lower transfers, and possible adjustments in 
expected future income from entitlement reforms 

(for example, lowered pension payments).
4 And where unsustainable credit booms occurred, 

deleveraging will boost savings rates for the 
foreseeable future. Finally, 
persistent uncertainty as 
to how these factors will ultimately play out can only 
_______ 
4 Of course, the power of that argument depends on the 
composition of the fiscal adjustment and on the specific design 
of entitlement reforms. For instance, raising the retirement age 

boosts individual lifetime income, with a positive effect on 
today™s consumption, whereas cutting future benefits or raising 
contribution rates would depress consumption. 
encourage sizable precautionary saving (Mody and 
Ohnsorge, 2010). 
Inflation Has Stabilized at Low Levels 
 Headline inflation in
 advanced economies 
bottomed out in the second half of 2009 on the 
heels of rising energy prices and, in some cases, a 
depreciating currency (for example, the United 

Kingdom) (Table 2). Core inflation has moved 

sideways at slightly above 1 percent in the euro area 

and below 2 percent in the United Kingdom. 

Inflationary pressures are expected to remain 
subdued, as large spare capacity combined with a 
slow-paced recovery should effectively contain 

firms™ pricing power for the foreseeable future 

(Figure 11).  In emerging Europe, the picture is much more 
diverse because of the variation in exchange rate 

regimes, economic structures, and country-specific 

effects of the global shoc
k. Countries with a fixed 
peg to the euro saw a continued decline in both core 

and headline inflation, which mainly reflected the 
strong domestic adjustme
nts required to correct 
external imbalances. Inflation in some countries 

with floating exchange rate
s seems to have stabilized 
in the last quarter of 2009 as monetary 
accommodation and the stabilization of activity 

moderated downward pressures on prices.

   The likely stabilization of inflation somewhat 
below official targets highlights the balance of risks 
surrounding the central forecast for prices. Upside 
concerns are that the cons
iderable expansion in 
central bank balance sh
eets could produce a 
monetary overhang threatening price stability. On 

the downside, the magnitude of the shock could 

persistently work to suppre
ss prices; that outcome is 
illustrated by recent euro-area wage bargaining 
implying wage increases below official inflation 
targets in some of the better-off countries and 
nominal wage cuts in some of the worst hit.  So far, survey-based measures of inflation 
expectations remain well anchored around official 

objectives (ECB, 2010; and Bank of England, 2010), 

suggesting that neither the fears of deflation nor the 

exceptionally accommodative policies have altered 
the credibility of monetary authorities.
5 Additional 
insights on the balance of risks can be read from 

monetary aggregates. These have remained broadly

stable as banks hoarded cash to self-insure against 
disruptions in the interbank market or other risks. 
The looser link between banks™ cash reserves and 
credit indeed led to a reduction in money 

multipliers, insulating monetary aggregates from the 
sharp increase in the monetary base (von Hagen, 
2009; and Figure 12). The variation in the evolution 

of money multipliers between the United Kingdom, 

the euro area, and selected emerging economies 

explains to a large extent the substantial differences 

in central bank attitudes toward liquidity injections 
and quantitative easing. Although the empirical link 
between money growth and inflation appears to 

have weakened in the past
 two decades relative to 
the 1970s and 1980s (Berger and Österholm, 2008), 
the behavior of monetary aggregates is consistent 

with the view that inflation risks are broadly 

balanced. 
Important but Broadly Balanced Risks 
 Risks to the outlook remain important but are 

seen as broadly balanced despite risks related to 

market concerns about sovereign balance sheets. On 

the positive side, the continued dynamism of activity 

in the United States and emerging economies in Asia 
and Latin America could boost global trade; the 
effect of these brighter prospects might encourage

 support confidence in more stable growth patterns 
in the region (Figure 13). 
 On the downside, market concerns about Greece, 
if unchecked, could turn into a larger debt crisis with 

possible repercussions for other sovereigns and the 

banking sector (IMF, 2010a). Other important risks are policy failures and shocks that would force an 
untimely exit from certain crisis policies. Among the 
unwelcome shocks would be a stronger pickup in 

commodity prices. That could incite central banks to 

raise interest rates sooner than expected, which in 

turn would undermine the effectiveness of the 

macroeconomic stimulus still in the pipeline and delay the normalization of credit conditions. In 

emerging Europe, a decrease in investors™ risk 

appetite could discourage further monetary easing, 
while accelerated deleveraging and tighter credit 
conditions could depress domestic demand more 

than expected. 
OUTLOOK: GETTING THE EXIT RIGHT 
13 
 Regarding policies, the failure to address 
sovereign concerns with cr
edible fiscal adjustments 
and to develop a contingency plan for a full-blown 

sovereign liquidity crisis would raise borrowing costs 

and require undesirably aggressive fiscal tightening 
in countries fearing contagion. Contagion could be 
triggered by similarities in
 debt dynamics, asset sales 
related to hedging activities, and the potential for 

spillovers through the banking system,
6 any of which 
could reignite fears of financial instability. Also, the 

crisis-induced increase in public debt and shortening 

of maturities has dramatically expanded refinancing 

needs that, given still-conservative lending 
standards, could crowd out investment in dynamic 
sectors. 
Normalizing Policies  The powerful and often synchronized policy 
responses to the crisis prevented a global financial 
meltdown that could have produced a worldwide 

depression. In countries that had some fiscal room 
for maneuver, discretionar
y stimulus and the work 
of automatic stabilizers bolstered aggregate demand 

and private consumption. A cascade of bank runs 

and failures were averted by exceptional liquidity 
support provided by a number of emergency 
monetary and financial measures: substituting for 

key market segments shut down by the crisis, 

extending guarantees on deposits and interbank 

liabilities to re-instill confid
ence, recapitalizing ailing 
institutions, and purchasing
 impaired assets. In the most vulnerable or hard hit countries in emerging 

Europe, the inevitable adju
stment to considerably tighter external financing was eased by coordinated 
assistance from the IMF, the EU, and other multilateral institutions. Large, front-loaded official 

financing packages allowed for less abrupt current 

account corrections and smoother policy 
_______ 
6 These spillovers are related to a variety of factors, including 
the limited ability of a credit-constrained government to 
continue supporting and recapitalizing vulnerable domestic 
institutions, the pressure sovereign spreads exert on banks™ 

funding costs (and the related difficulty of funding their foreign 
subsidiaries), and the direct exposure of foreign banks to 
troubled assets. 
adjustments than would have been possible 
otherwise. 
The Side Effects of Crisis Policies . . . 
 With the recovery under way, the need to 

maintain policies in emergency mode is less 

pressing. Instead, concerns about the costs and the 

limits of many crisis intervention measures are 

growing. These costs and limits are most visible in 

the fiscal realm, where si
zable fiscal stimulus and direct support to vulnerable financial institutions has 
massively increased public debt. Commonly used 

indicators show that re
storing sustainable debt 
dynamics over the medium term will be a 

formidable task (IMF, 2009c). Markets are therefore 

likely to more intensively scrutinize fiscal 

vulnerabilities, particular
ly debt dynamics. Those 
concerns are reflected in government bond yields, 

which have become more sensitive to fiscal 
fundamentals in the course of the crisis (Sgherri and 
Zoli, 2009) and are strongly 
related to the additional 
fiscal adjustment required to secure solvency over 
the next few years. Ulti
mately, governments must 
make a credible commitment
 to fiscal consolidation. 
Losing fiscal credibility could indeed trigger the 

sudden and painful elimination of the national debt 

overhang that the transfer of private risks and 

obligations to public balance sheets was supposed to 
avoid. It would also undermine the effectiveness of 
fiscal stimulus measures still in the pipeline by 

limiting central banks™ capacity to maintain policy 

rates at exceptionally low levels (Corsetti and others, 

forthcoming). 
 A simple and conventional way to assess debt 
sustainability is to compar
e the actual or projected 
primary budget balance (th
at is, excluding interest payments) with the level required to stabilize the 

ratio of public debt to GDP (Figure 14).
7 Three 
main messages emerge from that analysis. The first 

is that aiming to stabilize 
public debt in the short  
_______ 
7 The debt-stabilizing primary bala
nce is approximately equal to 
the permanent
 primary surplus needed over the indefinite future 
to cover outstanding liabilities, which is precisely the minimum 
requirement for long-term solvency (see IMF, 2003). 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
  14 
 run would be unrealistic (a
nd undesirable) for many countries because the magnitude of the required 

fiscal retrenchment would cr
eate significant risks of relapsing into deep recession (Figure 14, top panel). 

The immediate implication, and the second message, 
is that public debts will keep rising in the near future 
for a wide range of countr
ies, which is appropriate as long as it comes with 
credible plans to gradually move to sufficiently high primary surpluses. Of 
course, countries in which fiscal credibility is clearly 

at risk will inevitably have to front-load fiscal 

consolidation (as Hungary and Latvia had to do in 

2009, for example). For Greece there is an acute 

need to stabilize and ultimately reduce public debt. 
Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, which have stronger 
fiscal starting positions and credibility, will need to 

follow through with existing
 plans for consolidation. 
 The third message is that 
the fiscal efforts needed 
to bring debt dynamics under control are sizable but 

not unprecedented (Figure 14, middle and bottom 
panels). Some countries w
ill have to significantly 
shift their fiscal behaviorŠin many cases, currently 

projected fiscal efforts over the medium term 

remain insufficient. But in the recent past, many 

countries have sustained primary balances capable of 

firmly putting the ratio of public debt to GDP on a 

declining path. In any case, fiscal efforts will be 

complicated by the growing pressure of population 

aging on health and pensions outlays, suggesting that 
to be successful, fiscal adjustments should combine long overdue entitlement re
ductions with permanent 
savings in other primary expenditure items. 
 The costs and limits of crisis interventions are 
also becoming visible in the financial sphere. The 
stabilization measures that prevented a financial 
sector meltdown allowed 
some banks to postpone restructuring. Fragile banks depending on 

exceptional liquidity support and government 

guarantees remain a threat 
to financial stability. In 
addition, they can distort normal financial 

intermediation by using access to abundant liquidity 

at low cost to roll over the debt of overleveraged 

companies, thereby avoiding 
or delaying loan losses. If maintained for too long, blanket guarantees and 
liquidity support could undermine competition in -3-2-10123

Notes: Staff considered three alternative hypotheses about the difference 
between real interest rate and real growth rate: 75 basis points, 150 basis 

points, and 250 basis points. For example, the growth-interest differential 
measured recently for Germany is around 90 basis points. Clearly, many 
countries, particularly in emerging Europe, have experienced protracted 

periods during which real growth was consistently above the real cost of 

government borrowing, undermining incentives to generate primary surpluses.

the credit market and induce moral hazard. For 
example, the guarantees and support have prompted 

banks to seek immediateŠbut unsustainableŠ
profits through purchases of government bonds and 

carry trade operations to reconstitute capital and 
create liquidity buffers. However, such 
recapitalization strategies 
create significant risks from a possible repricing of government bonds and 

increased exchange rate volatility. 
. . . Call for a Cautious and Coordinated Exit  The costs of sustaining crisis policies for too long 
have led policymakers to begin thinking about 
normalization. In the fiscal area, many countries 
announced fiscal consolidation plans aimed at 

stabilizing public debt over the medium-term, 

though specific measures have
 not been identified in 
most cases. Where greater room for maneuver is 
availableŠmost notably GermanyŠadditional 

stimulus is being implemented in 2010.  In the monetary and financial areas, the 
withdrawal of emergency support has either been 

automaticŠbecause the leve
l of support is demand-
driven and diminishes along with the normalization 

of market conditionsŠor has followed 
preestablished sunset clause
s. For instance, the ECB conducted its final one-year maturity refinancing 

operation in December 2009, injecting •96.9 billion, 
barely more than one-fifth the amount allotted in a 
similar operation in June 2009. Similarly, it has 

confirmed the end of its six-month maturity 

operations and a gradual normalization of tender 

procedures for the three-month and weekly liquidity 

operations. Likewise, in Russia and other emerging 

markets, central banks have already largely 

normalized liquidity provision, although challenges 

remain in dealing with weak banks. Many temporary 
enhancements of deposit insurance schemes are 
scheduled to expire in
 2010 and 2011. Government 
guarantees for financial inst
itutions generally include 
either preset fee increases or the option for 

policymakers to raise fees as market conditions 

improve. For instance, issuance of government-
guaranteed bank debt has declined markedly in the 
euro area from an estimated monthly average of 

•35 billion in the first quarter of 2009 to less than 

•5 billion in the third quarter (Financial Stability 

Board, 2009). Official capital injections and 
purchases of impaired assets have also been falling, 
as banks could raise capital elsewhere. Finally, some 

countries benefiting from multilateral assistance 

have either kept the arrangement precautionary 

(Poland) or opted to decide about drawdowns on a 

review-by-review basis (Hungary) as they maintained 

or regained access to market financing under 
competitive conditions (see Box 1). 
 An important dimension of exit strategies is the 
existence of significant spillovers and the 

corresponding need for co
ordination and adequate 
sequencing. These spillovers operate across countries through trade and through financial cross-

border flows. However, they also occur across 

policy areas, reflecting the interdependence among 
key policy objectives (macroeconomic stability, 
financial stability, and fiscal sustainability). For 

example, exiting from systemic support of the 

financial sector to focus on restructuring has 

repercussions elsewhere because it modifies the 

degree of competition in a given national market. At 

the same time, it helps normalize credit conditions, 

enhancing monetary policy traction on the economy 

and ultimately facilitating the fiscal exit. The need 
for coordination is even greater in the euro area, 
where cross-border and cross-policy spillovers are 

intertwined. 
 In the EU, coordination has so far been 
orchestrated through existing procedures and 

common policies. On the fiscal side, the Excessive 
Deficit Procedure (EDP)Šwhich now concerns 
20 member states, including almost all euro-area 
membersŠtogether with the broader Stability and 
Growth Pact (SGP) serves as a common 

institutional anchor to 
medium-term adjustment 
plans. The implementation of the EDP has fully 

exploited the flexibility built into the 2005 reform of 

the SGP to extend deadlines for correction of 

excessive deficits and, in some cases, to permit a late 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
  16 
 Box 1. IMF-Supported Programs and External Adjustment 
Large trade and financial spillovers fr
om advanced economies 
exposed fiscal and financial vulnerabilities in 
emerging Europe and exacerbated home grown imbalances. In a number of countries, the synchronized collapse 
in trade and capital inflows pu
t an abrupt end to growth trajectories th
at had been fed by credit booms and asset 
price bubbles and created substantial 
external financing gaps. Large, front
-loaded financial assistance packages 
from the IMF, in close cooperation with the EU and othe
r multilateral institutions, cushioned the impact of the 
collapse and smoothed the required policy 
adjustments. The design of the unde
rlying economic programs in each 
country reflected its circumstancesŠthe amount of fiscal
 space available and the nature of the exchange rate 
regimeŠand the preferences of its authorities.  
Compared with previous crisis programs supported by 
the IMF, recent programs differ in a number of key 
features: 
Ł Financing has generally been larger and more front
-loaded, allowing countries to maintain supportive 
macroeconomic policies whenever possibl
e. When early policy adjustment wa
s inevitable, programs sought to 
strike a better balance between stabilization concerns an
d the need to restore poli
cy credibility. For example, 
fiscal policy targets were in
 general adjusted more rapidly to chan
ging conditions, but at the same time, 
programs sought to bolster structural
 fiscal reforms to preserve the me
dium-term objective of stabilizing or 
reducing public debts. 
Ł Program conditionality has been c
onsiderably streamlined, focusing mo
re on measures addressing the 
vulnerabilities that magnified the impact of the shock. 
For example, improvements in financial supervision, 
enhanced macroprudential regulation, 
and structural or entitlement reform
s with a durable impact on public 
finances figured prominently in many programs. 
Ł Preservation or enhancement of social safety nets to 
protect the poor and vulnerable has been given specific 
attention. Ł Because front-loaded financial assist
ance has helped stabilize market expe
ctations more quickly, it generally 
has lowered exchange rate volatilityŠor supporte
d the maintenance of currency pegsŠand allowed a 
smoother adjustment. The avoidance of 
such dislocations in turn has help
ed prevent disruptive balance sheet 
effects, especially in those countries with la
rge currency mismatches (see IMF, 2009b, Box 3). 
Ł Full-blown banking crises have generally
 been avoided despite the fact that 
the crisis hit particularly hard in 
countries that had experienced a credit
 boom. This resiliency refl
ected, in part, the top priority that programs 
gave to financial sector stabilizati
on, including guarantee sc
hemes backed by IMF reso
urces, initiatives to enhance bank supervision, and emer
gency liquidity support (table). 
The stabilization of economic and financial conditions 
following IMF-supported programs has allowed several 
countries (most notably Hungary) to re
gain or enhance access to market fi
nancing, putting a smooth exit from 
IMF programs clearly on the horizon. However, specifi
c constraints and developments may complicate the exit 
for some, including the legacy of punitive external obligat
ions (Iceland), the strictures of the currency regime

        Hungary $15.7 
billion, November 
2008 Address the main pressure points in public finances and 
the banking sector:  
Ł Substantial fiscal adjustment
 to provide confidence that 
the government's financing need 
can be met in the short 
and medium run.  
Ł Up-front bank capital enhan
cement to ensure that 
banks are sufficiently strong to weather the imminent 
economic downturn, both in Hungary and in the region.  
Ł Large external financing assistance to minimize the 
risk of a run on Hungary's debt and currency markets. 
In addition to financial assistance from the IMF, the 
program is supported by $8.4 billion from the 
European Union and $1.3 billion from the World 
Bank. On completion of the third review in September 
2009, the arrangement was extended for 6 months 
with a rephasing of the undisbursed amount. 
The fourth review of the program was completed in 
December 2009. The authorities have announced 
their intention not to draw additional resources.

        Ukraine 
$16.9 
billion, November 
2008 Ł Help the economy adjust to the new economic 
environment by allowing the exchange rate to float, aim 
to achieve a balanced budget in 2009, phase in energy 
tariff increases, and pursue an incomes policy that 
protects the population while slowing price increases.  
Ł Restore confidence and
 financial stability 
(recapitalizing viable banks and dealing promptly with 
banks with difficulties). 
Ł Protect vulnerable groups in society (an increase in 
targeted social spending to shield vulnerable groups).  
Since the program™s adoption, the marked further 
deterioration of the global economic environment 
has hit Ukraine harder than expected and has 
required a recalibration of economic policies.  
The second review of the program was completed in 
July 2009. 
Disbursements have been suspended, as corrective 
actions could not be impl
emented. Resumption of 
disbursement is conditioned on the adoption of the 
2010 budget.

2008 Ł Prevent further sharp króna depreciation by 
maintaining an appropriately tight monetary policy and 
temporary restrictions on capital outflows. 
Ł Develop a comprehensive and collaborative strategy 
for bank restructuring by (1) putting in place an efficient 
organizational structure to facilitate the restructuring 
process, (2) proceeding promptly with the valuation of 
banks' assets, (3) maximizing asset recovery in the old 
banks, (4) ensuring the fair and equitable treatment of 
depositors and creditors of the restructured banks, and 
(5) strengthening supervisory practices and the 
insolvency framework. 
Ł Initiating fiscal adjustment to put public debt back on a 
sustainable track while preserving key social safety 
nets. The first review was completed in October 2009. 
The agreement was extended and rephased to 
account for delays in implementing key measures,

restructuring. 
Ł Adopt fiscal measures to 
limit the substantial widening 
in the budget deficit and prepare for early fulfillment of 
the Maastricht criteria in view of euro adoption. 
Ł Implement incomes policies and structural reforms that 
will rebuild competitiveness under the fixed exchange

and a streamlining of nonpriority recurrent spending, 
which helps create fiscal space to expand 
infrastructure investment. 
Ł Strengthen the inflation-targeting framework while 
maintaining a managed floating exchange rate

external and financial environment has 
deteriorated substantially. In response, the 
authorities have (1) raised fiscal deficit targets for 
2009Œ10 while taking additional fiscal measures, 
(2) received commitments from main foreign 
parent banks that they would roll over their 
commitments to Serbia and keep their subsidiaries 
capitalized, and (3) requested additional financial 
support from international financial institutions and

start in the consolidation effort (2011 instead of 
2010). On the financial side, the common competition policy has been the main driver for 

coordinating state assistance to financial institutions, 

and the EC is using that lever to foster a 
reorientation from blanket support to restructuring. 
 That approach is in line with the exit principles 
endorsed by the G-20 in November 2009, but 

important gaps remain, notably in coordination. 

Indeed, the G-20 principl
es provide no specific 
guidance on the form or scope of coordination. For 
instance, the withdrawal of blanket guarantees 
should be closely coordinated to prevent 

opportunistic capital flows, which, by putting first 

movers at a disadvantage, would create an incentive 

to delay the exit. Coordination would also be vital in 

defining Europe™s new financial stability framework. 

The failure to harmonize su
pervisory and regulatory principlesŠnot only within the EU but also 

globallyŠcould severely distort competition and 
create new risks. 
From Exit to Restructuring  The crisis confronted po
licymakers with a double 
challenge. The first, now largely overcome, was to 

design and implement responsive macroeconomic 

and financial policies in a context in which the 

effectiveness of conventional policy could not be 

taken for granted. The second challenge is very 

much presentŠto gradually
 shift focus from short-term support to addressing the deep and wide-
ranging structural weaknesses exposed by the crisis. 
It is still too early to declare victory over the first 

challenge; policies must 
remain supportive until a self-sustaining recovery becomes entrenched. But it 

is also now time to engage the second task and 

establish the institutions 
and policies that will secure more balanced and sustained growth. 
Successful Exits: Sequencing and Coordination  A timely withdrawal of the highly distortive 
systemic support measures requires policymakers to 
quickly identify fragile fina
ncial institutions through 
recapitalization, restructuring, and, if necessary, 
resolution. This implies ac
celerating the recognition 
of loan and asset losses an
d assessing capital needs, including sufficient precautionary buffers. Where 

warranted, the process co
uld be assisted by 
programs to purchase impaired assets (such as a 
ﬁbad bankﬂ scheme). The early recognition of the 

eventual fiscal costs associated with these operations 
is all the more important in light of the planned kick 

in of significant fiscal adjustments in 2011 for many countries. 
 One difficulty in the EU is the dichotomy 
between an integrated financial market and national 

authorities. As commitment and synchronization 

will be of the essence to avoid unhealthy cross-

border capital flows driven by arbitrage 

opportunities, state-aid rule
s provide a key lever to 
coordinated actions, for instance by setting up 

uniform deadlines for endi
ng various interventions. 
 A rapid return to normal financial intermediation 
would secure credit supply and increase the traction 

of monetary policy, creating the conditions for an 

orderly normalization of fiscal and monetary 

conditions. Rising concerns about the short-term 

risk of a default and the long-lasting consequences 

of high public debtŠespecially in the context of the 
growing pressures from aging populations on public 
financesŠput a premium on fiscal adjustments 

preceding 
monetary policy normalization. Two other 
reasons for prioritizing fiscal retrenchment over 

monetary normalization are the inherent inertia in 

fiscal policy instruments and the possibility that 
fiscal policy effectiveness may be eroded by 

expectations of lower future disposable income due 

to tax increases and transfer cuts. 
 Monetary policy can and should remain fully 
accommodative as long as inflationary pressures 

remain subdued. Besides, all options should remain 

open in tackling the realization of negative risks and 

confronting the related deflationary pressures. In 

that regard, monetary policy is not constrained by 
the withdrawal of measures directly aimed at 
preserving financial stability. To the extent that a 

prolonged period of very low nominal interest rates 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
  20 
could sow the seeds of new financial excesses and 
asset price bubbles, the behavior of credit aggregates 

will need to be carefully monitored. The planned 
European Systemic Risk Board should play an 

essential role in fostering macroprudential 
supervision (see Box 2). 
 In the European Union, 
the size of spillovers and 
the corresponding need for coordination requires 

that the proposed sequencing 
of exits be subject to 
explicit commitments by member states, using 

existing procedures and common policies to foster 
the credibility of such commitments. The costs of 
coordination failures would 
be large. For instance, 
delays in implementing fiscal consolidation and 

plans for the reform of entitlements could re-ignite 

acute concerns about debt sustainability and 

undermine the stability of th
e euro. The result would be a counterproductive mix of tight monetary policy 

and loose fiscal policy. Also, delays in putting 

together a full-fledged fi
nancial stability framework 
at the EU level would complicate the withdrawal of 
systemic support measures at the cost of heightened 

moral hazard and dysfun
ctional intermediation. 
Restructuring  The success of exit str
ategies is conditioned on 
policymakers™ ability to de
sign and implement long-
term solutions to the structural weaknesses of their 

economies. In the financial 
sector, the key objective 
is to implement a new set of regulatory requirements 

that will deliver greater stability without impairing an 

efficient allocation of funds. While progress is being 

made in various forums such as the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision, lingering 
uncertaintyŠabout the restrictiveness of the new 
regulations and, in particular, capital requirements or 

limits on the size and activities of banksŠshould be 
resolved sooner rather than later. In the European 

Union, this comes along with the need to close the 

gap between an integrated financial market and 

fragmented supervision (see Box 2). A natural 

complement to more un
ified regulation and supervision of the financial sector is a stronger 
prudential policy aimed at containing the build-up of 
financial excesses that preceded the crisis. 
 The conduct of macroeconomic policies could 
also be improved with a view to providing greater 

macroeconomic and financial stability. 

Macroeconomic frameworks and policy surveillance 

should incorporate a broader set of variables, 
including asset prices, credit growth, and current 
account balances, that were relatively neglected in 

the run-up to the crisis but shaped country-specific 

reactions to the global shock. In particular, the crisis 

has triggered an intense debate on the role that asset 

prices, balance sheet mismatch, and credit aggregates 

should play in the conduct of monetary policy. 

However, while fiscal policy can deploy a variety of 

instruments to address 
different objectives, 
monetary policy is best used
 to target price stability. Financial excesses that led to
 the crisis are probably best addressed with targeted prudential regulations. 

Fiscal surveillance should pay attention to variables 
reflecting underlying vu
lnerabilities that may not 
show up directly in budget 
figures. In light of recent experience, the current account balance arguably has 

a role to play among indicators that may indicate a 

need for preemptive policy action (see Box 3). 
 The design of fiscal policy would benefit from a 
more explicit reference to the macroeconomic 

stabilization function of public finances. Automatic 

stabilizers must be complemented with provisions 

that discourage procyclical tendencies. Subjecting 

budget preparation and execution to the scrutiny of 
nonpartisan agencies or adopting binding structural 
budget balance rules (as in Germany, Sweden, and 

Switzerland) would provide important channels 

through which fiscal policy could play a heightened 

stabilizing role. Turkey™s planned introduction of a 

fiscal rule allowing for a simple automatic 

adjustment to economic conditions is another 

example of pragmatic approaches to better 

incorporate the stabilization objective in budget 
preparation. 
 In the euro area, the Greek crisis is a powerful 
reminder that in a monetary union without a 

centralized fiscal authority, fiscal discipline is a 

collective responsibility of all members. The crisis 

exposed long-standing gaps in the area™s fiscal 
architecture, including the failure of EU budgetary

 Box 2. Toward a New European Financial System 
As they deal with the financial crisis and its consequences, European policymakers must keep a close eye on 
progress toward financial system reform. Comprehensive 
reforms are needed to establish a system that is 
competitive, integrated, sound, innovat
ive but prudent, and independent of 
contingent taxpayer support. Yet the 
financial system urgently need
s regulatory and legislative clarity if it 
is to attain a new sort of normalcy and 
return to its basic intermediation function. 
Reforms are proceeding on various 
fronts. For banks, the Basel Commi
ttee on Banking Supervision has 
proposed important revisions to the Basel II framework.
1 These focus on making banks safer and reducing 
incentives for risk-taking. They
 do so by raising the quantity and qualit
y of capital, limiting 
leverage, introducing 
a countercyclical element to capital, establishing liqui
dity buffers, and improvin
g structural liquidity. The 
introduction of a leverage ratio may 
require particular adjust
ments from European ba
nks, whichŠunlike their 
U.S. peersŠare currently not subject to such a ratio.
 Implementation, after calib
ration based on an impact 
assessment, is planned for end-2012. 
Meanwhile, in December 2009 the Economic and Financ
ial Affairs Council (ECOFI
N) reached agreement on 
an overhaul of the EU™s pruden
tial framework based on the propos
als of the De Larosière Group.
2 The 
agreement would establish a European 
System of Financial Supervisors (ESF
S) for microprudential supervision 
and a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) for macr
oprudential supervision. The ESFS will comprise the 
national prudential authorities an
d three new EU-level European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs).
3 The ESAs 
will be tasked with establishing a single rule book for 
the financial sector, harmonizi
ng supervisory practices and 
mediating or settling disa
greements between supervisors. The ES
RB will issue nonbinding warnings and 
recommendations on systemic risk to the ESFS and othe
r relevant policymakers. Th
e European Parliament is 
still considering these proposals and is seeking am
endments to strengthen the new institutions. 
The European Commission has held broad, public cons
ultations on crisis manage
ment and resolution and on 
the related issue of 
deposit guarantees.
4 In parallel, a working group of the Economic and Financial Committee 
is looking into fiscal burden sharing.
5 In this context, the IMF™s staf
f has recommended establishing an integrated EU-level framework for crisis management
, crisis resolution, and depositor protection. The 
framework would encompass a European Resolution Auth
ority (ERA) as a ﬁfire brigadeﬂ for the banking 
system that would have the mandate and the tools to de
al cost-effectively with fa
iling systemic cross-border    –continued.Note: The main author of

 banks under specific early intervention and resolution regi
mes. This ERA would best 
be twinned or combined 
with a European Deposit Insurance and Resolution Fund. Th
e system would need fiscal backing, but the focus 
on cost-effectiveness should minimize the use of it.
6 The most troubled parts of Europe™s
 banking system are being restruct
ured under the stewardship of the 
European Commission™s competition serv
ices, which are responsib
le for enforcing the EU™s rules on state aid. 
In applying these rules, the Commission has sought to 
balance the restoration of financial stability and of 
lending to the economy with the containment of mora
l hazard, the preservation 
of competition, and the 
restoration of sound market functioni
ng. To obtain the Commission™s approv
al, these banks™ restructuring plans 
need to ensure long-term viability and to correct fo
r state-aid-induced distorti
ons to competition through 
downsizing. It would be useful to build on this experi
ence to establish a durabl
e integration of the EU™s 
competition policies with its 
financial stability policies. 
Regarding specific problems and gaps 
in regulation outside the banking system, the EU has launched regulatory 
initiatives to deal with rating ag
encies, central counterparty clearing
 systems, and currently unregulated 
investment vehicles such as hedge funds and private e
quity funds. These initiatives have pushed the global 
debate but would be most effective if they resulted
 in a global consensus prod
ucing well-regulated but open 
markets. 
Several other issues remain to be
 examined in full, including: 
Ł the future of securitization and the potential of 
covered bonds to serve as a lower-risk alternative, 
Ł ways to improve consumer protection, 
Ł accounting standards, 
Ł options to better discern between good and bad financial innovation, 
Ł systemic riskŠoptimal ways to dete
ct and address it and the role that 
monetary policy should play in the 
process, Ł the appropriate role of ratings and certain quantitative
 approaches (such as Value-
at-Risk) in regulation and 
supervision, and  
Ł conflicts of interest 
in the financial sector. 
Finally and importantly, governance problems across all type
s of enterprise have been 
a major factor behind the 
financial crisis. It is essential that
 these be addressed at their core.
7 As the prudential and legislative fr
ameworks evolve, banks will need to adapt their business models. 
Policymakers will need to take care that
 banking remains a viable business that
 is able to attract funding. Cross-
border business structures will also need to change to 
facilitate supervision and resolution and provide a sound 
basis for effective cross-border financ
ial stability arrangements. Such cross-border adjustments underscore the 
importance of an integrated EU-level framework for cr
isis management and resolu
tion. Such a framework is 
essential for the stability of the single ma
rket and to forestall the kind of twin
 fiscal-financial crises that several 
member states are now confronting. 
  6 See Strauss-Kahn (2010) and F
onteyne and others (2010). 
7 In this regard, the Basel Committee has launched
 a consultation on corporat
e governance (BCBS, 2010).

   Box 3. Current Account Imbalances in the Southern Euro Area 
Current accounts in the seven countries of the Southern
 Euro Area (SEA) have deteriorated sharply since the 
mid-1990s, going from balance in 1994 to an average deficit of 10 percent in 2008 (figure).
1 The downward 
trend is shared by most SEA countries, although the de
ficits remained at more moderate levels in Malta and 
Slovenia and especially in Italy (3 pe
rcent of GDP). In contrast, the eight countries of the Northern Euro Area 
(NEA) accumulated current account surpluses over the same period.
2 The decline in the current accounts of SEA countries 
coincided with their joinin
g the European Monetary 
Union (EMU) and continued after their subsequent adoption of the euro. These facts raise three sets of 
questions about the large current account deficits in th
e SEA: (1) Are they connected to the formation of the 
EMU or to the financial liberalization trend? (2) Are they 
excessive? (3) Do they matter in a currency union, and, 
if so, what are the policy choices to help reduce imbalances in the absence of the exchange rate instrument? 
            The evidence supports the notion that
 the EMU and euro adoption played
 an important role in the SEA 
deficits. Over the 1994Œ2008 period, the de
terioration in current accounts co
incided with a la
rge decrease in 
private saving rates and, to a lesser extent, with a rise in
 investment rates, 
while public saving actually improved. 
An econometric analysis shows that the declines in privat
e saving were spurred by 
the financial liberalization 
that took place in the early and mid-1990s and by increa
sing dependency ratios. Yet 
it was the creation of the 
EMU and, especially, the introduction of the euro, that 
drove the declines in current accounts by allowing 
countries to maintain their investment
 levels above what could be financed
 from lower domestic saving. Hence,

Piyaporn Sodsriwiboon. 
1 The SEA consists of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, 
Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. SEA-4 denotes the four 
largest SEA countries: Greece
, Italy, Portugal, and Spain; the latter 
three joined the EMU in 1994 and the euro 
area in 1999, and Greece joined the eu
ro area in 2001. The remaining SEA co
untries, SEA-3 (Cyprus, Malta, and
Slovenia) joined the EMU in 2004 and the euro area in 2007
Œ08. Not included in this 
analysis is Slovakia, which 
joined the EMU in 2009.

 economic integration improved access to
 the international pool of saving, 
but it did not necessarily make it 
optimal or sustainable. Even 
in countries in which an increase in invest
ment played a more important role in the 
current account deterioration (Spain and Slovenia), mo
st of the increase took place in less productive 
nontradables sectors, su
ch as construction.  
The current account defi
cits of most SEA countries 
seemed excessive as of 2008.
 The deficits substantially 
exceeded their equilibrium levels as
 determined by the so-called macroba
lance approachŠa regression including 
countries™ fundamentals, such as the net international in
vestment position, fiscal ba
lance, growth prospects, 
demographic developments, and financ
ial liberalization. A complementary 
approach, which focuses on external 
sustainability and calculates the curr
ent account deficit that would stab
ilize the country™s net international 
investment position, yields similar conclusions and, in
terestingly enough, similar estimates of the extent of 
disequilibrium. Other symptoms of the competitiveness pr
oblem include a deteriorati
on of growth in some SEA 
countries following their accession to the EMU (Italy 
and Portugal) or growth that was accompanied by 
accumulating debt (Greece). 
Although the current global financial crisis
 has forced some reduction in current 
account deficits, they are expected to remain high in
 the medium run as a resu
lt of the countries™ low 
productivity and weak competitiveness.

(Spain) or excessively rosy expectations abou

Ł because the longer the imbalances persist and the greater their size, the larger the chance that adjustment 
may be abrupt rather than gradual. 
What policies can be used to improve current account imbala
nces if the nominal exchange rate is not available? 
Policy options include fiscal adjustment
; ﬁinternal devaluationﬂ; productivity-e
nhancing policies, especially in the 
nontradables sector; and regul
atory financial policies. 
Ł In the short run, fiscal policy is perhaps 
the most important macroeconomic policy tool
, especially where monetary policy is 
centralized. Fiscal consolidation seems 
particularly appropriate if public saving is 
too low or monetary policy 
too lax, which may well have been the case for SEA coun
tries in which real interest
 rates were below those

in the NEA during 2000Œ08. Fiscal c
onsolidation will remain crucial for 
reversing the use 
of discretionary fiscal stimulus and automatic stabiliz
ers during the crisis, for lowering 
the public debt, and for reducing 
domestic demand pressure. Fiscal policy could also play
 a role in reducing or e
liminating policies that may previously have been distorting priv
ate saving and investment decisions (for example, mortgage interest relie
f and the favorable tax treatment of debt). 
Ł In the medium term, an internal devaluat
ion and structural policies to improve prod
uctivity growth are needed to regain 
competitiveness. Internal devaluation mimics a real devaluation 
by reducing labor costs at home relative to 
those of trading partners. It can be 
achieved by moderating nominal wage
s or by cutting employers™ social 
security contributions (in countries with sufficient fi
scal space). At the same time, competitiveness and 
higher standards of living would be fostered by 
productivity-enhancing policies, including in the 
nontradables sector (which feeds into
 the costs of the tradables sector).
 The impact of appropriate policy 
adjustments can be large. For instance, it is estimated that if Italy,
 Portugal, and Spain were to bring their 
labor productivity growth to the highest levels observed in the NEA (Finland and the Netherlands), their 
current accounts would improve by 
2Œ2.5 percentage points of GDP. 
Ł Regulatory financial policie
s could also be important
. By improving financial superv
ision and making provisioning 
more stringent in booms, central bank
s could, to some degree, limit the 
growth of private credit and the 
accumulation of problem loans. The co
untercyclical loan-loss provisioning
 system applied by the Bank of 
Spain has received a lot of at
tention, as it helped build important prov
isioning cushions for hard times. Yet, 
as Spain demonstrates, financial regul
ation by itself cannot completely pr
otect the financial markets or the 
economy. 
 surveillance to extract sufficient restraint in 
good times, and the absence of crisis 

management procedures. 
Filling these gaps will 
be essential to improve the functioning and 

resilience of the monetary union. The rules-

based fiscal framework should thus be amended 
to substantially strengthen incentives to 
maintain fiscal discipline in benign times. While 
changing EU statutes may take time, an 
important area of cooperation for euro area 

member states could be enhancing national 

fiscal frameworks, including a peer-review 

process of reform needs at the national level 

and mutually agreed deadlines for enacting 

needed reforms. Building centralized capabilities 
for crisis management would be important for 
containing market uncertainty and the risk of 
contagion, but it raises complex legal and 
practical issues.  On the structural front, long-lasting 
constraints on growth remain to be addressed. 

Product market regulations and sectoral 

subsidies continue to hamper the development 
of inward-oriented service sectors, leading to a 
strong reliance on external demand as an engine 

of growth in some countries. Labor market 

rigidities increase the odds that large temporary 

shocks permanently increase unemployment 

(Blanchard and Wolfers, 2000), discourage job 

creation, reduce the labor supply, and impair a 

smooth reallocation of resources from declining 
sectors to dynamic ones. For a number of 
countries, gaining compet
itiveness is essential: 
breaking the taboo against nominal wage cuts 

would greatly expedite the required adjustment. 
 A better integration of macroeconomic and 
structural issues in EU surveillance would not 
only increase the incentive for member states to 
undertake reforms within their responsibility but 

would also allow for a more focused and more 

country-specific approach. For example, stability 

and convergence programs could address the 

budgetary impact of structural reforms, 

particularly when such reforms incur short-term 
costs but lead to substantial long-term savings. 

In that sense, stability programs could be crafted

case by case to advance the reforms that are 
most needed to lift potential growth. 
 Emerging markets are faced with a greater 
variety of policy challenges, reflecting contrasted 

strengths and vulnerabilities exposed by the 

global crisis. In many countries, avoiding 

procyclical monetary and fiscal policies and 

preventing boom-bust cycles in credit are top 

priorities. Stronger macroeconomic 

frameworksŠincluding rules-based medium-

term fiscal frameworksŠand well-designed macroprudential regulations would indeed contribute to greater macroeconomic stability, 

improving the investment climate and lifting 

potential growth. In some countries, labor 

market reforms aimed at 
easing labor flows and increasing nominal wage flexibility would help 

address the legacy of 
domestic booms by facilitating the needed reallocation of resources 
from nontradables to tradables sectors. More 

flexible labor markets would thus restore 

competitiveness and encourage labor 

participation. An array of regulatory and 
administrative reforms aimed at improving the 
overall investment climate would also be critical 

to boosting potential growth; it would also 

foster internal rebalancing and diversification by 
facilitating the movement
 of resources across 
sectors. Higher and more stable growth would in turn help alleviate fiscal vulnerabilities, 

although efforts to contain public spending 

growth, particularly in countries with extensive 
entitlement systems, would still be needed. As 
will be emphasized in Chapter 2, these reforms would help ensure the resumption of healthy 

capital inflows and restart real income 

convergence. 
 27 
2.  Managing Capital Flows 
  For emerging Europe, the key policy challenge will be 
attracting and harnessing sustainable capital inflows to restore 

growth. A healthy level of capi
tal inflows requires balancing domestic and external sources of economic growth and avoiding 

the boom and bust consequences of excessive inflows. For 

countries that are already seeing a resumption of inflows, 

responsive macroeconomic policies, including currency appreciation, where possible, and tightening fiscal policies will 
be critical. Where capital inflows conducive to income 

convergence are yet to resume, policy efforts should focus on 

improving productivity in the tradables sector, easing 

intersectoral labor mobility, narrowing skill mismatches, and 

addressing country-specific growth constraints in infrastructure. 

For the region as a whole, improving financial stability will be 

essential. Prudential policies 
on banks, especially capital 
requirements on foreign borrowing, and macroprudential 
policies, including sectoral risk weights, to stem overheating of 
certain sectors will help avoid the buildup of financial 
vulnerabilities. Emerging Europe™s Diverging 
Policy Challenges 
 The crisis has had a major impact on capital flows 
to emerging Europe.
8 After a long period of ever-
increasing inflows, the region saw them slow down as the crisis took hold. The effect has differed across 

countries, with the difference reflecting the degree 
of income convergence, the size and structure of 
their economies, and monetary and exchange rate 

regimes. However, managing
 capital inflows remains a crucial challenge across all countries, with 

policymakers asking how to ensure a healthy level of 

foreign investment, how to prevent excesses, and 

how to improve the stability of an increasingly 

integrated internatio
nal financial sector. 
_______ 
Note: The main authors of this chapter are Johan Mathisen and 
Srobona Mitra. 
8 The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are included in 
the analysis even though they have been recently reclassified as 
ﬁAdvancedﬂ countries. 
 The precrisis pattern of capital inflows holds a 
number of important lessons for managing inflows 

today. Different types of foreign capital investment 

are linked, directly and indirectly, to different 

macroeconomic and structural policies. And 

simulations show how prudential policies interact 
with financial vulnerabilit
ies connected to bank-
related capital inflows. In particular: 
 A healthy level of capital inflows requires a 
balance between domestic and external sources 
of economic growth. Structural policy efforts to 
restore a balance between the nontradables and 

tradables sectors are most successful when 
focused on improving intersectoral labor 
mobility, reducing skill mismatches, and 
addressing country-specific growth bottlenecks 
in infrastructure. 
 Preventing excessive inflows demands 
responsive macroeconomic policies. For 
countries with a pegged exchange rate, the best 
response to inflows in excess of those driven by 
structural factors is to tighten fiscal policy. For 

countries without a pegged exchange rate, the 
most effective response is appreciation. A free-
floating exchange rate is also helpful in 
preventing excessive inflows and a buildup of 
financial fragilities. 
 Prudential policies can support the resilience of 
the financial sector in the face of inflow 
pressures. Prudential tools such as capital 
requirements on foreign borrowing help to lower 
excessive inflows and related risks in banks. However, the impact tends to be temporary, and 
depends on the accompanying macroeconomic 

policies and the effectiveness of cross-border 
financial supervision. 
 The policy implications differ across countries 
according to the impact of the crisis on growth and 
whether capital inflows have started to resume. 

Some countries, such as th
e Baltic states, will need 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
28 
to rekindle and sustain capital inflows while 
reorienting the sources of economic growth toward 

the tradables sector. Although this transformation 

will take place in the private sector, support by 

policies to address country-specific constraints in 
labor markets and infrastruc
ture will be crucial. In 
other countries, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Estonia, 

Poland, and Serbia, there are signs that capital flows 

are already resuming, and the challenge would be to 

implement responsive macroeconomic policies to 

stem any excess. For the region as a whole, the 

question is how to avoid the buildup of fragile 

financial conditions that were often associated with 

recent capital inflows in countries such as the 
Baltics, Hungary, and Ukraine. Europe Was Different  Capital inflows were larger in emerging Europe 
than in other emerging economies (Figure 15). 

Greater financial integration enabled the region to 

benefit from ﬁdownhillﬂ capital flows from rich to 

poor nations (Abiad, Leigh, and Mody, 2009). At the 

peak of inflows in 2007, 
the average inflow in emerging Europe as a share of GDP (20 percent) 

was double that in Latin America. Most of the 
difference is attributable to cross-border loans and 
deposits from western European parent banks to 

their affiliates in emerging Europe. Other types of 

capital inflows in Europe, like direct investment and 

portfolio debt and equity, were broadly similar to 

those in other regions. 
 The large inflows created macroeconomic and 
financial vulnerabilities for emerging Europe. The 

region ran current account deficits, experienced 

higher credit growth, and had worse overall fiscal 

positions than emerging economies in other regions 

(Figure 16; IMF, 2007). In addition, foreign currency 
lending built large curren
cy mismatches in balance 
sheets, especially among households (Mathisen, 

forthcoming), which created substantial risks 
because currency depreciations could increase debt 
burdens. These vulnerabilities, together with the 

exposure of externally funded credit growth to the 

financing difficulties of parent banks when the crisis 
struck, constitute one reason for the deeper 
downturn relative to other emerging economies.
9  The decline in foreign inflows was particularly 
abrupt in emerging Europe. Average capital inflows 

in the central, eastern, and southeastern European 

(CESE) countries declined sharply, from about 

20 percent of GDP in 2007:Q4 to almost none in 

2009:Q3. The drop has been particularly abrupt for 
bank and corporate overseas borrowing, although 

the European Bank Coordination Initiative helped 

some countries avoid strong retrenchment in 
exposures by parent banks.
10 Inflows of foreign 
direct investment (FDI), especially intercompany 

debt, declined as well. In contrast, Asian emerging 

economies saw sharp reversals, mainly in portfolio 
inflows, while Latin America experienced relatively 

smaller declines. 
 The intensity of the sharp drop in inflows varied 
within emerging Europe. Investors began 

differentiating emerging European economies 
according to their fundamentals, macroeconomic 
policies, and financial fragilities, leading to large 

differences across the region (IMF, 2009a). The 
Baltics, which experienced the largest surge in 

inflows during 2003Œ07, saw the sharpest reversals 

(Figure 17). More than other countries, the Baltic 

states relied on credit growth funded either through 

the wholesale market or bank parents, and it was 

this category of inflows (i.e., Other Investment 
Liabilities) that saw the shar
pest decline in the crisis. 
Inflows to the Czech Republic and Poland neither 

surged nor declined to the ex
tent that they did in the 
Baltics. The surge in Hungary and Romania was 

similar to that in the Baltics, but mainly due to FDI 

equity inflows that fell sharply during the crisis.

financial sector vulnerabilities that were building up during the 

boom episodes in European emerging. The list includes, but is

The Motivation for Precrisis Inflows  Capital was attracted to the CESE countries prior 
to the crisis probably for a very simple reason: the 

prospect of returns higher than in home markets. 

Potential growth was high
 in many countries as income convergence took hold and moved east with 
the EU enlargement process, boosting returns 
especially in the nontradables sector, including in 

banks. Inflows often exceeded the healthy amounts 

associated with convergence, as macro policies 

raised returns through currency appreciation, rapid 

credit growth, and expansionary fiscal budgets. In 

many countries, the inflow
s were directly passed on 
to unhedged clients, which undermined the stability 

of the financial system. Convergence Factors Help Explain 
Inflows . . . 
 Inflows were closely intertwined with the level of 
income in recipient countries (see Appendix 

Table 1). FDI inflows were attracted by strong 

economic growth but tended to slow (as a share of 

GDP) as the country b
ecame richer. Other 
investment flows, especially cross-border loans, had 
the opposite relationship with income: as the 

economies matured and their GDP growth slowed, 

they attracted more inflow
s. This seems to fit well with the casual observation that as emerging Europe 

recovered from the crisis in the late 1990s, many 

countries grew strongly and attracted large FDI 

inflows, especially in the banking sector. Once the 

economies stabilized, they tended to see the other 
types of capital inflows such as parent-bank funding 
of the foreign-owned subsidiary. 
 Overall capital flows were also related to 
increased urbanization and the size of the service

sector relative to the economy (see Appendix 
Table 1). However, the motivation for each type of 
inflow varied somewhat. Increased urbanization 

tended to attract more FDI, perhaps in companies 

catering to clients that increasingly lived in cities. 

The level of services, on the other hand, attracted 

more of the Other Invest
ment Liabilities inflows. The reason might be that the level of services is a 

gauge of the development and diversification of the 

economy: countries that already had a large service 
sector generally attracted more of the other 
investmentsŠboth bank and nonbankŠas foreign 

investors generally favore
d a larger established 
domestic demand.  Reformers were handsomely rewarded with more 
inflows. With the liberalization of economies and 
institutional and infrastruc
ture reforms, countries became more attractive to foreign investors (Bakker 

and Gulde-Wolf, forthcomin
g). However, countries 
that started with a high initial level of development 

(high transition index) had to undertake relatively 

fewer reforms (Figure 18). Thus, the change in the 

transition index also reflects the growth potential of 

countries, which helped draw in foreign capital. 

Some of the reforms were directly linked to capital 
inflows (Ötker-Robe and others, 2007). In fact, a 
large portion of total FDI in most countries 

comprised privatization receipts (Figure 19). In 

many countries the link between FDI and 

privatization has been direct

. . . and So Do Macroeconomic Policies  While convergence factors explain a large share 

of precrisis capital inflows, many countries saw 

inflows surging in excess of what can be explained 

by the initially low but growing levels of per capita 
income, increasing urbanization, the expanding 
services sector, and the progress in reforms. What drove the surge in inflows in Estonia and Latvia and 

in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Ukraine (Figure 20)? 

Empirical analysis shows that much of the 

exuberance, especially in cross-border loans, can be 

explained by various concoctions of monetary, 

fiscal, and exchange rate policies.
11 Exchange rates explained a large share of the cross-sectional 
and temporal pattern of capital inflows: 
 Regardless of exchange rate regime, stable 
exchange rates swayed other investments as well as portfolio inflows (Figure 21). This fact 
corroborates earlier evidence that capital flows 
are attracted by stable exchange rates in emerging 
economies (IMF, 2010a). 
 In countries with nonpegged exchange rates, the

during 2004Œ08, depended on how freely the 
exchange rate was floating. Nominal appreciation 
tended to slow inflows either due to tightened monetary conditions and the associated lowering 
of inflation and growth expectations or by 

prospective lowering of returns by removing 
expectations of appreciation. 
 Countries with a fixed exchange rate attracted 
more other investment inflows as their nominal 
effective exchange rate appreciated. The 

phenomenon could be related to carry-trade 
opportunities for nonresidents: as trading 
partners™ currencies depreciate, the inflows into 
pegged exchange rate regimes increase because 
of higher nominal returns. 
Credit markets interacted with exchange rates regimes and 
fiscal policies to draw in capital as well: 
 Countries with heavily
 managed or pegged exchange rates tended to have low or even 
negative real lending rates. These countries also 
had the most rapid credit growth and received 
the highest level of total inflows (Figure 22). 
 Higher credit growth attracted more inflows into 
banks and lowered portfolio debt inflows (as the 
private sector substituted bank debt for foreign 
debt). This latter relationship was even stronger 
if the government was running higher balances 
(so as to lower the financing needs of the public 

sector).   
The improved fiscal stance also attracted capital: 
 A higher fiscal balance increased overall inflows 
and other inflows, but lowered debt inflows (as 
the financing needs of the government fell). 

However, in fixed exchange rate regimes, higher 
government deficits were associated with higher 
inflows. Overall, most CESE countries ran 
deficits during 2005Œ07, and almost all ran 
structural deficits.  
 In countries whose improvements in 
government balances were associated with credit 
booms, capital inflows were even stronger, 
especially other investment inflows. This could 
imply that capital inflows and the growth in 

domestic demand reinforced each other

  FDI into the financial sector also experienced 
higher volumes of cross-border loans into banks 
and corporates (Figure 24). This sowed the seed 
of credit booms in many 
countries. For instance, 
in Bulgaria, the Baltic states, and Ukraine, the 
ratio of credit to GDP increased annually by 
more than 10 percentage points during 2005Œ07, 

substantially boosting domestic demand. 
Capital inflows were associated with a loss of competitiveness, 
increased wage pressures, and a weakening link to domestic 

investment: 
 The surge in capital inflows put pressure on the 
real effective exchange rate, potentially 

undermining competitiven
ess. With the rapid growth of the nontradables sector in many 
countries, the wage-cost gaps (the percentage 
point difference in wage-cost growth) between 
the service and the manufacturing sectors were 

large, especially in countries with fixed exchange 
rates (Figure 25). Earlier evidence (Goretti, 2008) 
on wage-setting behavior in the new member 
states points to tight labor market conditions 
(due to strong labor demand and looseŠmainly 
public sectorŠwage policies) as another factor 
contributing to a loss of
 competitiveness. This 
evidence matches the ob
servation that lower 
labor market flexibility and greater skill 
mismatches are associated with higher wage-cost 
gaps in the EU (Figure 26). 
 The link between capital inflows and domestic 
investment weakened (Figure 27), as capital 
inflows spilled over to ot
her countries, thereby relieving some of the overheating pressures. 
Capital criss-crossed borders in unprecedented 
volumes, and about half the inflows to Estonia, 

Hungary, and Ukraine, for example, went out 
again as investments abroad (Table 3). This 
might simply be part of financial integration,
12 but it could also reflect the relationship between 
inflows and precipitous consumption booms in 

several countries. _______ 
12 Risk diversification helps explain both inflows and outflows 
in emerging economies in general (Mody and Murshid, 2005).

 The impact of macroeconom
ic policies on capital 
inflows was amplified by persistently low country-

risk premiums. Many investors seemed oblivious to 

the risks of overheating and financial fragilities and 

considered the exchange rate risk to be low. And 

while vulnerabilities differed, neither the market nor 
rating agencies differentiated between countries until 

the crisis hit. As a consequence, risk-adjusted 

interest rates in some countries looked more 
attractive than they should have and continued to 
attract foreign investors. The phenomenon extended 

into the banking sector. Foreign subsidiaries 

borrowed money either from the parent bank or 

from the wholesale market at low interest rates, as 

traditional indicators of ba
nk stability reinforced the 
sense that risks were manageable. High capitalization 
and profitability provided comfortable cushions for 

banks, increasing their indi
cators of stability in the 
run-up to the crisis (Figure 28). That was precisely  
the period when they should have been creating 
additional buffers, for instance by provisioning for 

future losses or by setting aside capital through

Use of Inflows
 higher risk weights on loans to certain sectors 
(IMF, 2009a). In the absence of proper risk 

adjustment, the return on assets that foreign banks 

received from funding their emerging European 

affiliates looked highly attr
active, in particular when 
returns in advanced economies were low 

(Figure 29). Macroprudential Policies Influenced the Composition of Inflows and 

Associated Risks  As worries about both macroeconomic and 
financial vulnerabilities 
mounted, policymakers attempted to stem capital inflows, including through 

prudential tools (Box 4). The buildup in financial 

fragilities was most prevalent in countries that 

experienced a surge in
 inflows during 2004Œ07 (Figure 30) and seemed to correlate with the 

presence of fixed or heavily managed exchange rates 

(Mathisen, forthcoming). In the Baltic states, for 

example, the combination of exchange rate stability, 
prospects for euro adoption (Rosenberg and Tirpak, 
2008), and interest rate differentials encouraged 
savings in domestic currency deposits and 

borrowings in foreign currency. In some flexible 
exchange rate regimes, households and corporations 
took advantage of the stable nominal appreciation 

and increasingly switched to foreign currency 

borrowing and domestic currency saving 

(IMF, 2009b). The only countries that avoided 

building up major financia
l imbalances were those 
with freely floating exchange rates and those that 
prohibited foreign currency lending to households. 
 Although country experiences varied, prudential 
tools seem to have temporarily slowed capital 

inflows into banks and changed the composition of 

inflows. Restrictions on capital outflows can hinder 

the repatriation of profits (Ostry and others, 2010).13 Stricter controls on inflows are associated with 
lower portfolio debt inflows (see Appendix Table 1). 
Prudential measures also diverted inflows into less-

supervised channels. An 
example is the bank-by-
bank credit ceilings introduced during 2005Œ06 _______ 
13 Restrictions on nonresidents™ ability to withdraw their funds 
should, strictly speaking, be classified as a control on inflows, 
because the lowering of nonresident restrictions on capital 

outflows makes a country a more
 attractive destination for 
inflows by providing greater assurance that capital can be 
repatriated.

   Box 4. Prudential Measures to Stem the Tide of Capital Inflows in Emerging Europe 
In the run-up to the crisis, many countries in emerging
 Europe adopted a wide rang
e of measures to manage 
large capital inflows (Appendix Table 2). They met,
 however, with only mixed success (Ötker-Robe and 
others, 2007; and Hilbers and others, 2005). 
The adopted measures focused on the following ar
eas: (1) macroeconomic policy; (2) prudential 
requirements (capital requirements, asset classificati
on, provisioning rules); (3) administrative (reserve 
requirements, capital controls); (4) supervision and m
onitoring (greater disclosu
re, cooperation with home 
supervisors); (5) promoting better understanding of 
risks (both for banks and the general public, also 
including moral suasion); and (6) developing the market (develop foreign currency hedging markets, create 
or strengthen credit registry). 
Many of the governments of the eight states joining 
the EU in 2004 preferred to 
strengthen supervisory and 
monitoring measures and limited their 
use of administrative and prudential
 measures. In some respects, they 
were constrained in their policy options by their commi
tments to the EU and others. For example, new EU 
member states that applied for OECD membership co
mmitted themselves to liber
alizing capital outflows, 
and that seemed to have helped ease some pressure 
in the Czech Republic and Poland. At the same time, 
Poland found that caution in liberalizing inflows was helpful. 
In contrast, some countries in southern Europe (includi
ng Croatia and Serbia) and the two states that joined 
the EU in 2007 (Bulgaria and Roma
nia) took a more interventionist
 stance by imposing a range of 
administrative and prudential meas
ures. They enhanced their reserve re
quirements, often differentiating 
them by currency and broa
dening them beyond deposits to include 
some foreign exchange liabilities. In 
some cases, reserve requirements applied to short-term
 deposits and foreign borrowing were raised to very 
high levels, reaching, at th
eir peak, 30 percent in Romania and 45 percent in Serbia. On top of their existing 
reserve requirements, Bulgaria and Croatia imposed marginal reserve requirements on credit in excess of an

allowed ceiling (Bulgaria) and on new foreign borrowing
 (Croatia). The two countries also adopted many 
prudential measures, such as higher capital requirem
ents, tighter asset classification and provisioning, and 
rules specific to foreign currency borrowing and lending. Some of these rules became quite complex (such as 
allowing exemptions or adjustments according to co
llateral values). At the 
same time, central bank 
monitoring was improved, along with campaigns 
to promote better unde
rstanding of risks.  
Debt management measures in Bulgaria
, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, and Turk
ey were aimed at shifting public 
borrowing from internationa
l to domestic markets. 
Taken together, however, the above me
asures were not sufficient to st
em the tide of capital inflows. 
Although the effectiveness of individual measures is 
difficult to assess, here are some broad, tentative 
conclusions: Ł Prudential and administrative measures seem to have
 slowed credit growth at least temporarily; and in 
some cases they created liquidity and capital buffers 
and fostered resilience in 
the banking systems where 
they were applied. At the same time, the measures 
generated some circumventi
on by market participants: 
(1) diverting capital inflows to other channels 
such as less-regulated nonbanks (such as leasing 
companies); (2) using accounting tricks such as book
ing loans offshore; and (3) 
borrowing directly from 
abroad rather than from banks (as the combined impa
ct of all the policy measures increased banks™ cost 
of funds). Thus, while the expansion 
in the assets of the banking sector may have been reduced, external 
credit flows to these countries remained strong. 
Ł Some breathing room was gained through liberaliz
ation of capital outflows and through delays in 
liberalizing inflows.  
Ł Reserve requirements to limit credit
 growth may have helped by creati
ng a liquidity buffer available for 
release when needed. Many countries have reduced reserve requirements during the crisis. 
Ł Debt management measures
 seem to have played a role in redu
cing countries™ vulnerability to foreign 
currency rollover and in devel
oping domestic bond markets.  
Ł Cooperation with home supervisors improved inform
ation flows and opened communication lines, all o
f which was useful in the downturn. 
 in Bulgaria, where bank borrowing leveled off while 
direct cross-border borrowing by corporates 

accelerated (Figure 31). Similarly, in Turkey in 2005 
and Croatia in 2007, corporate external borrowing 
took off with a downturn in bank inflows when 

restrictions increased. The impact of prudential 

measures on capital inflows and credit growth were 

stymied by the comfortable profit levels in banks, 

their motivation to expand market share at the 

expense of profitability, and a high degree of 

financial integration. Banks used their profit cushion 

to bear the higher costs of the prudential regulations 
or supplied credit to the corporate sector directly 
from parent banks. 
 Simulations reveal that the variation in the impact 
of prudential regulations has a lot to do with the 
type of instruments used, 
the monetary or exchange 
rate regime prevailing, and 
the form of cross-border 
liabilities of the banks (Box 5). Focusing on the 
capital requirements (CRs) on banks™ foreign 
borrowing and ﬁtax typeﬂ marginal reserve 

requirements (MRRs) on banks™ foreign liabilities, 

the simulations show that prudential tools can 

reduce foreign borrowing and credit growth 

temporarily.

Box 4) for a discussion on contingent capital. The advantage of 
this measure is that a bank™s capital position will be improved 

precisely when a bank needs it. Issues about the determinants of

  Box 5. Which Prudential Tool Is Best at Ma
naging the Financial Stability Risks of Capital 
Inflows? Answers from Model Simulations 
Model simulations were used to measure the effectivenes
s of two types of prudential tools aimed at reducing 
foreign borrowing and lowering liquidity risks in banks:
 a ﬁtax typeﬂ marginal reserve requirement (MRR) on 
banks™ foreign liabilities and a capital requirement 
(CR). The simulation used a medium-sized dynamic 
stochastic general equilibrium model of a small, open,
 emerging market economy.
1 The model™s real sector is 
standard. The banking sector™s assets consist of risky 
loans extended to local house
holds and businesses plus 
required and excess reserves. Bankin
g liabilities consist of domestic de
posits, foreign borrowing, and bank 
capital. The banks face convex cost
s of falling below the minimum regulator
y capital adequacy ratio, cannot 
easily raise fresh capital when needed from their owners (or by issuing new equity), and face maturity 
mismatches from financing long-term loans with s
hort-term foreign borrowing. The model includes 50 
percent liability-euroization in the 
private sector. The MRR and CR ar
e simulated on two types of policy 
regimes: an exchange rate 
peg and a flexible exchange rate with inflation targeting (IT). Because of currency 
mismatches in the private sector™s balance sheets, th
e inflation-targeting central bank also considers the 
exchange rate. 
The MRR is imposed on short-term foreign borrowing in 
excess of a certain threshold level. It acts like a 
direct cost (tax) on bank funds. Fo
r the MRR to raise the marginal cost
 of banksŠthe point at which banks 
no longer find it worthwhile to dig into their profit
 cushionsŠit needs to be at a level high enough for 
banks to reduce foreign borrowing. The MRR helps, in
 some degree and temporarily, to distribute the 
foreign borrowing over time (first figure). The effects are quickly reversed after the MRR is abolished. 
During the time that the MRR is in place, the level of
 GDP drops more in a fixed 
exchange rate regime than 
  . . . continued..Note: The main author of this box is Jaromir Benes.

 in a flexible-exchange rate IT regime
. The effect on GDP occurs via lower credit growth, as banks transmit 
the higher cost of funds to lending rates. The effect
 of the MRR does not depend on whether the bank is 
foreign-owned.

 Alternatively, through a CR, banks could be required to
 hold additional capital against short-term foreign 
borrowing. The idea is to create a capital buffer to ensu
re that liquidity risks do 
not translate into solvency 
risks during crises. The simulations indicate that the CR
 is effective in lowering foreign borrowing and credit 
growth temporarily; to the extent that
 banks are close to the regulatory mi
nimum capital ratio, they actively 
substitute domestic deposits for fore
ign borrowing and continue to lend 
(second figure). Since the cost of 
the CR is contingent on penalties if
 the regulatory minimum capital adequa
cy ratio is violated, lending rates 
do not go up. But to the extent that banks™ foreig
n borrowing goes down, bank
s generate lesser credit 
growth unless domestic deposits go up. The restructurin
g of the banks™ funding sources and the extra capital 
under a CR reduce risks to financial 
stability. The effects of 
the CR on the level of GDP vary only marginally 
between fixed and flexible exchange 
rate regimes. However, the GDP leve
l declines more in countries in 
which banks are using retained ea
rnings instead of accessing th
e deep pockets of parents.

growth can be limited, they give banks an incentive 
to restructure funding towa
rd domestic deposits and 
increase their capitalization levels, both of which 

reduce financial stability risks. Moreover, CRs 

impact the output gap less 
than MRRs, especially in 
a fixed exchange rate regime, and the adverse real 
effects of CRs are considerably reduced if banks can 

raise fresh capital easily from parents.
15 That said, 
MRRs are generally easier to implement, and they 

lead to a welcome buildup of liquid assets. Of 

course, opportunities for circumvention or 

regulatory arbitrage would reduce the effectiveness 

of either of these measures considerably. 
Policy Implications 
 The lessons from the experience of precrisis 
capital inflows differ greatly across economies. Some 
countries will need to focus on policies to restore 

and sustain capital inflows while shifting the sources 

of economic growth toward the tradables sector. 

Others are increasingly faced with the challenge of 

implementing responsive macroeconomic policies to 

stem excessive inflows. For the region as a whole, 

the question is how to improve its financial stability 

in the midst of an ever more integrated international 
financial system. 
Resuming Convergence-Related Flows 
 For the countries looking to resume convergence 
by attracting capital inflows, the challenge is to 
enhance the scope for productive investments in the 
tradables sector. A number of measures can 

contribute. The most effective policies will likely be 

those that address country-specific private sector 

growth bottlenecks in
 labor markets and infrastructure.  In particul
ar, recent business surveys indicate that for poorer emerging European 

countries, constraints in access to energy, water, and 

land are most important, 
while labor and transport 
constraints top the list for richer countries (Mitra, 
_______ 
15 The Croatian experience with an MRR illustrates the same 
point. The MRR rate was moved up from 24 percent to 
55 percent over 2004Œ06 but still had no significant effect on 

capital inflows or on credit growth. 
Selowsky, and Zalduendo, 2009).
16 To resume convergence-related inflows, especially FDI, 

addressing such country-specific growth bottlenecks 

seems particularly important, as the traditional pull 

from ﬁthe superior endowment of infrastructure and 
labor skills with which countries started transition is now goneﬂ (Mitra, Selowsky, and Zalduendo, 2009).  Privatizations and enterprise reform could help 
attract required private resources to facilitate the 

move from nontradables 
to tradables. Because 
privatizations tend to be associated with higher 
capital inflows, additional efforts in this direction 
will help increase additional capital inflows. While 

the scope for such reforms might be increasingly 

narrow in EU countries, there might be substantial 

room in other emerging European countries to 

consolidate their portfolio of state-owned 

enterprises (EBRD, 2009).  In addition, increasing labor market flexibility will 
help reallocate resources and workers from the 

nontradables to the tradables sector and support 

competitiveness. The fact that labor market 

flexibility in emerging Europe recently deteriorated vis-à-vis the advanced countries indicates that 

substantial room for reforms exist in this area 

(EBRD, 2009). The wage gap between the 
nontradables and tradables sector is large, even 
though lower growth in nontradables in the next few 

years might help reduce relative nontradables wages 

and moderate pressures 
on real appreciation. 
Moreover, firms in emerging Europe often lack 

flexibility as they generally have few workers on 

part-time or fixed-term contracts. A final obstacle is 

employment legislation, which is more rigid in 

emerging Europe than in 
the advanced countries in Europe (EBRD, 2009).  Finally, investment in human capital and R&D 
will help attract foreign capital in the manufacturing 

sector. Continuous upgrading or reorienting of skills _______ 
16 Again, large variations exis
t across countries: firms in 
Hungary report not being affected by transport or labor 
constraints; labor constraints are particularly important in 

Belarus and Estonia; and Belarus,
 Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine 
are affected by land constraints. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
46 
(through education and training) facilitates the flow 
of labor between sectors and helps alleviate the 

problem of unbalanced growth of services relative 

to manufacturing. Moreover, manufacturing in 

emerging economies in the EU tends to focus on 
products that are of relatively low quality when 
compared with those from more advanced 

neighbors. Moving up the product quality ladder 

through higher expenditures on R&D and 

innovation would also 
ease competitiveness 
problems (IMF, 2010b). 
Responsive Macroeconomic Policies 
 Among the lessons from the precrisis period is 

that macroeconomic po
licies are important determinants of capital flowsŠand the crisis has 

amplified the policy impact. In the aftermath of the 
crisis, investors are increasingly differentiating 
among countries according to fundamentals and 

soundness of policies (Figure 32; IMF, 2009b). This tendency may become especially important, as 

postcrisis investors could be more risk conscious while facing lower returns. 
 The postcrisis stance of
 investors has important 
implications for fiscal and 
exchange rate policies, 
although the implications differ according to 

whether capital inflows have started to resume and 

the type of exchange rate regime. For countries that 
have yet to see a return of inflows, the ongoing 
repricing of risks implies that monetary, fiscal, and 

exchange rate policies should focus on reducing 

uncertainty. For flexible exchange rate countries, 

allowing a freely floating exchange rate might be 

most appropriate, for instance through the

explicitŠand de factoŠsubordination of exchange 
rate policies to the inflation objective, as in the 

Czech Republic. For any exchange rate framework, a 

rules-based fiscal policy approach would help clarify 

the expected financing ne
eds of the government, 
reduce the long-term interest
 rate and spreads, and, in turn, increase capital inflows (IMF, 2009b).  For countries to which capital flows are already 
resuming, the challenge is to implement responsive 

macroeconomic policies to prevent the inflows from 

becoming excessive. For pegged exchange rate 
regimes, the tightening of fi
scal policies is essential. 
For flexible exchange rate regimes, empirical analysis 

indicates that allowing the exchange rate to float 

freely might be the most effective macroeconomic 

policy tool to stem excessive inflows.  Greater 

exchange rate flexibility helps mitigate the pressures 

on domestic demand as well as credit growth and 

thus lowers risk profiles. It also reduces the 

perceptions of low exchan
ge rate risks that could encourage unhedged foreign currency positions. 
However, the lag in implementing fiscal policies 

might be too long to effectively manage capital 

inflows in the short run. 
Prudential Policies to Improve 
Financial Stability 
 Improving the financial stability framework in 
emerging Europe to streng
then the resilience of the 
financial system can help manage capital inflows. 
Prudential policies focused on capital inflows can 

reduce the buildup of risks. Macroprudential 

regulation such as higher (capital) risk weights on 

mortgage loans could have
 the benefit of steering 
resources away from the nontradables sector. 

Reforms of the financial regulatory architecture to 

ensure adequate oversight and regulation of cross-
border financial institutions would support financial 
stability. 
This Would Minimize Financial  
Fragilities . . .  Prudential regulations can help reduce financial 
fragilities by influencing the composition andŠto a 

smaller degreeŠthe volume of inflows, while 
building buffers in banks. Residency-based 
restrictions on the move
ment of capital across countries can have similar effects.
17 As the analysis 
shows, certain types of prudential regulations under 

certain circumstances are more effective than others 
in changing the mix of inflows (also see Binici, Hutchison, and Schindler, 2009): 
 Capital requirements (CRs) on short-term 
foreign liabilities may be more effective in 
lowering financial stability risks than tax-type 
controls such as margin
al reserve requirements 
(MRRs) on foreign liabilities. CRs can help create 
a buffer of ﬁcontingent capitalﬂ that reduces the 
risk of a liquidity crisis turning into a solvency 
crisis; CRs also have less adverse effects on the 
output gap and are less sensitive to the type of 

exchange rate regime in force. However, MRRs 
might be easier to implement and help create 
liquidity buffers. Both CRs and MRRs can induce 
a more stable funding structure. Their impact on 
credit growth is limited, however. 
 A certain degree of coordination of monetary 
and macroprudential policies is necessary. For 
instance, the real effects associated with MRRs 
are more pronounced un
der fixed exchange rates, as there is no monetary policy tool to 
cushion the downturn. On the other hand, the 
monetary policy response
 under flexible rates could work to reverse attempts to reduce the 
growth of foreign borrowing through prudential 
policies. 
 Capital controls on flows to all sectors could be 
an option in countries that are grappling with 

surging capital inflows and competitiveness 
problems (Box 6). This is so especially in the 
non-EU emerging economies where foreign 
exchange interventions against appreciation 
pressures are counteracting monetary policy 

objectives, and in particular when inflation is
_______ 
17 Use of capital controls is constrained by EU, OECD, and 
WTO regulations (see Epstein and others, forthcoming). Also 
see Ostry and others (2010).

 Box 6. Russia™s Capital Flows: Experience and Challenges 
Russia experienced large capital inflows in the run-up to the global 
financial crisis. Steadily increasi
ng oil prices, combined with a 
prudent policy of taxing and saving
 most of its oil revenue, had 
significantly strengthened Russia™s external position. By August 
2008, international rese
rves had increased to almost $600 billion 
and were the third highest in th
e world. This apparent stellar 
performanceŠcombined with a very favorable outlook for oil 
pricesŠmade Russia an attractive de
stination for foreign capital.  
Comparison with the Rest of Emerging Europe 
Russia shared many of the ex
periences of ot
her emerging 
European economies. Private capital inflows came largely in the 
form of loans to corporates and commercial banks (first text 
figure). Fiscal policy was procyc
lical. And monetary policy was 
increasingly geared toward limit
ing exchange rate appreciation 
pressures, which encouraged one-way currency bets and 
speculative inflows, contributing to
 negative real interest rates and 
high, entrenched inflation. Also
, long-standing weaknesses in 
banking supervision and regulation,
 together with negative real 
interest rates, allowed rapid cred
it expansion and the buildup of 
large unhedged foreign exchange exposures in the run-up to the 
crisis (second text figure). Nevert
heless, Russia is distinct from the 
rest of emerging Europe in three key areas: First, as an oil exporter, 
Russia™s capital inflows came on t
op of very large current account 
surpluses. Second, near
ly all of the foreign borrowing by banks and 
nonfinancial corporates was in th
e form of wholesale financing 
(syndicated loans and bonds) rather than transactions between 
parent banks and their subsidiaries, owing to a low degree of 
foreign ownership of the banking 
sector. Third, flows to large 
nonfinancial corporates, mainly in
 foreign currencies, were much 
more important in Russia than in other emerging European 
economies (third text figure). Indeed, in Russia, it is the 
corporate sectorŠrather than 
the household sectorŠthat has become heavily indebted.  
The Crisis 
The crisis hit Russia with particular virulence. The dual shock of 
collapsing oil prices and a reversal of capital flows put the heavily 
managed exchange rate under pressure. Given large bank and 
corporate exposures in foreign currency, the authorities allowed a 
controlled depreciation of the ru
ble while providing significant 
ruble liquidity. The economy sank
 into a deep recession. One 
year later, however, oil prices were roughly

double their trough levels, the economy had begun to gr
ow again, the ruble was appreciating, and capital was 
flowing back. 
Policy Challenges 
Managing capital inflows is one of the key policy challeng
es facing the Russian author
ities. For Russia, all lines 
of defense against excessive inflow
sŠmacroeconomic and prudential polic
ies as well as capital controlsŠ
should be considered. 
Macroeconomic policies will need to be geared to co
ntaining domestic demand
 once the economy recovers. 
Fiscal policy should be the main tool for mitigating pressu
res on the real exchange rate in the face of rising oil 
prices. The authorities are rightly beginning to withdraw 
fiscal stimulus, but this pr
ocess will need to intensify 
and continue over the medium term to
 ensure that the non-oil deficit is br
ought to a sustainable level and that 
fiscal policy does not once again beco
me procyclical. Risks in this regard
 would be heightened if the large 
expenditures during the crisis became entrenched. Mo
netary policy should be squarely aimed at keeping 
inflation low by allowing greater flexibility in the exchange rate, which woul
d also discourage speculative capital 
flows. But there are limits to the ability of macroeconomic polic
ies to manage large capital inflows. For example, 
allowing the ruble to appreciate to prevent excessive infl
ows could cause an overvaluation of the real exchange 
rate and damage competitiveness. However, reserve ac
cumulation through intervention can be costly and may 
lead to high inflation. Thus, comple
mentary policies will 
also be needed: 
Ł Prudential regulations must be s
hored up to limit the risks of cred
it booms. Such efforts could include 
countercyclical capital requirements, restrictions on foreign currency lending, and differentiated reserve 
requirements to reduce currency and maturity risks. 
Some of these prudential measures may actually have 
more ﬁbiteﬂ in Russia, given banks™ reliance on wholesale funding and lack of recourse to parents for 
additional funding. The Russian authorities ar
e considering a number of these measures. 
Ł But prudential measures may not be
 enough. Capital controls may also 
be needed as part of a broader 
policy package, especially 
because nonfinancial corporates borrowed 
excessively in the precrisis years and 
are beyond the reach of prudential
 tools. Of course, capital contro
ls are not a panaceaŠthey can be 
difficult to enforce (especially outside the bankin
g system), they can be circumvented, and their 
effectiveness may vary. But Russia should keep an ope
n mind on capital controls, at least as a temporary

advances in integrating national frameworks are promising in this regard

countries should adjust their regulatory frameworks 
to the ongoing EU-wide effort to reduce the scope

needed for clear and effective communication with

institutions. One way to proceed would be to create 

risk-based clusters of home-host supervisors. The 

structures could build around the European Bank

 Box 7. Financial Reform: An Oppo
rtunity for the New Member States 
The financial crisis highlighted the di
fficulties of establishing effective 
cross-border oversight and supervisory 
cooperation under a harmonized set of rules. Clearly, avoidi
ng future crises requires e
ffective prudential control 
over cross-border operations and the ab
ility to use this control 
to address risks affecting individual countries. 
At the same time, however, financial stabilit
y arrangements need to support
 the development of the EU™s 
single financial market, which has ex
panded access to financial resources for new member states (NMS). The 
planned reforms of the EU supervisory 
framework (see also Chapter 1, Box 3) offer the potential to reconcile 
the goal of developing effective cro
ss-border oversight with the enhancemen
t of a single EU financial market: 
Ł The European Systemic Ri
sk Board (ESRB) will monitor the stability 
of the EU financial system and has a 
mandate to look into country-level risks. It can 
issue risk warnings and recommendations, to which 
supervisors and other relevant poli
cymakers will need to respond under 
a ﬁcomply or explainﬂ rule. These 
capabilities should enable the ESRB to organize 
an EU-wide response to a problem using the most 
appropriate policy tools. The ESRB can also investig
ate the soundness of financial instruments and risks 
related to, for example, foreign currency lending and recommend remedies. 
Ł The European System of 
Financial Supervisors (ESFS)
 is mandated to develop a single rule book and 
harmonize supervisory practices, which should greatly 
reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage. The ESFS 
will enhance the ability of supervisors 
to discuss problems, learn from ea
ch other, and move toward best 
practices. This greater cooperation o
ught to improve the quality of supe
rvision and strengthen supervisors 
in their engagement with the institutions they over
see. The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) will 
be able to issue binding technical 
standards as well as guidelines subj
ect to ﬁcomply or explain.ﬂ Those 
powers should help the ESAs formulate effective res
ponses to ESRB risk warnings and recommendations. 
Ł Cross-border financial institutions 
will be supervised by cross-border co
lleges of supervisors, overseen by 
the ESAs. The ESAs will seek to st
andardize the functioning of these colleges, and they will have a 
mandate to mediate and, if needed, settle conflicts among the members of a college. This should greatly 
enhance the dialogue and cooperation between home and 
host countries, includin
g in crisis situations. 
These new financial stability 
arrangements will be successful if all EU supervisory authorities accept joint 
responsibility and accountability for financial stability, not 
only in the EU as a whole but also in each member 
state. In essence, EU prudential authorities will have to fundamentally reorient their mindset toward the use of 
European rather than national tools 
to address risks to financial stabilit
yŠeven when those risks are local. 
Such an orientation promises a much 
more effective approach to financial 
stability: the focus can shift from the 
location of institutions to the location of risks, whic
h eliminates much of the 
scope for circumvention and 
regulatory arbitrage. However, it 
requires a new method of operation. 
For the NMS, it will be especially 
important that they seek effective influence 
in the European rule-setting processes.  
Many reforms are under cons
ideration in the current wave of re-reg
ulation. Proposals in several areas have 
particular relevance for the NMS: 
Ł The European Commission is consid
ering raising capital requirements
 on foreign-currency-denominated 
mortgage loans granted to unhedged borrowers. The ch
ange would help the NMS in
 several ways: it would 
remove an important risk to their financial st
ability, improve consumer 
protection, promote the 
development of domestic financial markets, and help
 avoid excessive house price inflation. A broader 
approach, for instance through cons
umer protection law, may be warranted to discourage all foreign-
currency lending to borrowers that do not have sufficient assets or income in foreign exchange to safely 
service such loans.  
 Note: The main authors of this box 
are Wim Fonteyne and Andrzej Raczko. 
MANAGING CAPITAL FLOWS 51 
Ł On the basis of proposals by the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision, the European Commission is 
seeking to reduce the risk of boom-bust cycles of 
the kind the NMS have experienced. The proposals seek 
to make the regulatory framework less procyclica
l by introducing through-the-cycle expected loss 
provisioning and cyclically adjust
ed capital requirements. These moves would require banks to build a 
sufficient capital buffer in good ti
mes and would reduce the risk of fi
nancial excess bu
ilding upon itself 
through rising asset prices and low realized losses. 
Ł The EU is seeking to in
troduce harmonized liquidity
 standards based on recent proposals of the Basel 
Committee. These would include a 30-day Liquidity Co
verage Requirement and a 
longer-term Net Stable Funding Requirement. These proposals should make NM
S banks less vulnerable to variations in the 
availability of funding, notably potenti
ally unstable foreign fu
nding, but they may also impact the availability 
and cost of credit. 
The NMS could facilitate the transformation to and effe
ctiveness of the new environment by building their 
own macroprudential frameworks, identifying systemic ri
sks, and conducting the necessary analysis to work 
effectively with the ESRB and ESFS. The NMS authorities 
should bring the risks they identify to the attention 
of the ESRB with a request for corrective action and 
be prepared to implement the recommendations of the 
ESRB and the guidelines of the ESAs. And the NMS supervisors need to organize themselves to function 
effectively within the colleges of supe
rvisors. Separately, the NMS authoritie
s could establish a regular dialogue 
with the home authorities of the foreign 
institutions active in their market 
concerning local risks to financial 
stability. This could take the form of
 periodic meetings that bring togeth
er all these supervisors, as well as 
representatives of the ESAs and ESRB, into a sort of 
national college of supervisors for the country. Such 
collaboration would also be of great benefit to the home co
untry authorities, as it would help them understand 
the risks to which their institutions are exposed. 
 banks remained engaged in the region during the 
crisis. A regular dialogue between these bodiesŠ

which could include representatives of the European 

Systemic Risk BoardŠwould facilitate information-

sharing and could provide the basis for joint analysis 

of common concerns and the formulation of 

effective responses. Over time, a formal 

international institutiona
l framework encompassing 
both EU and non-EU countr
ies on a voluntary basis 
should be established. 
Conclusions 
Managing capital flows in emerging Europe entails 
policy challenges that vary by country; the variations 

reflect the degree to which the crisis affected the 

country™s growth and whether capital inflows have 

started to resume. Some countries will need to 

restart and sustain capital inflows while shifting the 

sources of economic growth toward the tradables 
sector. The tran
sformation will take place in the 
private sector. But it must be supported by policies 
to restore a balance between the nontradables and 
tradables sectors; such policies will improve 

intersectoral labor mobilit
y, reduce skill mismatches, and address country-specific growth bottlenecks in 

infrastructure. Other countries are already seeing 

capital inflows resuming and are faced with the 

challenge of how to implement responsive 

macroeconomic policies to stem excessive inflows. 
For countries with a pegged exchange rate, the best 
response to inflows in excess of those driven by 

structural factors is to tighten fiscal policy. For 

countries with non-pegged exchange rates, the most effective response to a surge is appreciation. A free-

floating exchange rate is also helpful in preventing 

excessive inflows and the spread of financial 

vulnerabilities. For the region as a whole, the 

financial system™s defenses against excessive inflows 
can be supported by prudential policies. Prudential 
tools such as capital requirements on foreign 

borrowing help to temporarily lower excessive 

inflows and related risks in banks. However, the 

effectiveness of these interventions tends to be

temporary, depend on the accompanying 
macroeconomic policies and the effectiveness of 

cross-border financial supervision.
