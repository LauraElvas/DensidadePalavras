Vandenbussche, and Ivanna Vladkova-Hollar under the guidance of Bas Bakker and 
Christoph Klingen, with contributions from Xavier Debrun, Wim Fonteyne, Andrzej 

Raczko, Johannes Wiegand, and Boriana Yontcheva. This Regional Economic Outlook: Europe was coordinated by the Emerging Europe Regional Division of the IMF™s European Department and overseen by Adam Bennett (Senior Advisor) and Ajai 
Chopra (Acting Director) of the European Department. Cleary Haines, Pavel 

Lukyantsau, and Xiaobo Shao provided research assistance; and Amara Myaing and 
Martha Bonilla provided administrative and editorial assistance, respectively. Joanne 

Blake of the External Relations Department oversaw the production. The report is 

based on data as of September 27, 2010. The views expressed in this report are those 
of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive Directors or their national authorities.ixIntroduction and Overview  Europe is recovering from its deepest recession in the postwar period. Following a 
4.6 percent contraction in 2009, GDP is projected to increase by 2.3 percent in 2010 and 
2.2 percent in 2011 (Table 1). With the exception of Greece and Portugal, growth in all 
countries will be positive next yearŠa stark difference from 2009, when only Albania, 
Belarus, Israel, Kosovo, and Poland saw positive growth. 
 The recovery in Europe has been boosted by the resurgence of the world economy. 
Global GDP growth is approaching precrisis growth rates (4.8 percent in 2010 and 4.2 in 
2011), and European exports are benefiting. Export growth is especially strong in countries 
that export capital goods, which had earlier seen a very steep drop in external demand. 

Germany grew at an annualized rate of 9 percent in the second quarter, driving a resurgence 
of exports from its main suppliersŠincluding in emerging Europe.  Advanced Europe is projected to grow by 1.7 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent in 2011 
(Chapter 1). The eruption of sovereign troubles in early 2010 threatened confidence and 
shook a still weak financial system. Yet, as the euro weakened and global stock markets 
tumbled, policy actions helped contain the problem and the recovery endured. Despite 

recent strength, however, the upswing in advanced Europe is projected to remain weak by 

historical standards and also compared with other advanced economies. In part, these 
growth differentials are due to the lingering impact of the crisis and the accelerating fiscal 

adjustment in 2011. But they also reflect well-known structural rigidities in the labor, 

product, and services markets that will limit the euro area™s potential growth now that the 
inventory cycle has run its course.  Although the outlook has brightened, significant risks remain. The surprisingly strong 
growth in the first half of 2010 could continue longer than expected and provide an 
additional short-term thrust to the recovery by boosting private demand. Activity in the 
United States or emerging Asia might still exceed expectations and keep exports up. At the 
same time, however, global growth could very well turn out to be weaker than predicted, 

with a tail risk of a double-dip recession. Renewed volatility in European financial and sovereign markets is also a possibility.  In view of these risks, it will be crucial to get policies right. Fiscal consolidation, while 
inevitable, should be undertaken in a way that minimizes the negative impact on growth; 
monetary policy must steer carefully between the need to normalize policies on the one hand 
and the necessity to mitigate sovereign market volatility and ensure bank liquidity on the 

other; and the recent checkup of European banks must be followed by rapid action to 

eliminate remaining weaknesses in balance sheets while continuing to safeguard lending 
capacity. In addition, if the confidence of financial markets, consumers, and investors is to 
be stabilized beyond the short term, the governance of the European Union (EU) and the euro area will need to be fundamentally improved.INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW 
xi 
 Emerging Europe is also recovering, growing by 3.9 percent in 2010 and 3.8 percent in 
2011 (Chapter 2). Emerging Europe had been hit hard by the global crisis, as it was affected 
not only through lower exports, but also through a sharp drop in capital inflows, which 

brought an end to the domestic demand boom that many countries had experienced in the 
precrisis years. The region is now recovering on the back of resurgent exports, but domestic 
demand remains subdued, particularly in countries where the deflation of precrisis asset and credit booms has been most severe. 
 The outlook in emerging Europe will depend crucially on developments in western 
Europe. Renewed turmoil in western Europe could affect emerging Europe not only 

through trade channels; it could also hurt capital flows to the region and domestic credit growth, which would further weaken domestic demand. Policymakers in emerging Europe face the difficult challenge of dealing with the legacies 
of the crisis while not hurting the recovery. Headline fiscal deficits rose sharply during the 

crisis, and have remained high in 2010. To a large extent, these deficits are structural: 

although headline deficits were low in most countries before the crisis, a temporary boom in 

revenues masked the underlying deterioration that resulted from the rapid growth of public 
expenditure. Credit growth has been weak since the onset of the crisis. This is the result of 
lower capital transfers from advanced Europe, increasing nonperforming loans (NPLs)Š

which necessitate an increase in provisioningŠand weak demand. With demand for credit 
now recovering, public policies could reduce supply-side constraints on credit growth by 
reducing uncertainty about macroeconomic policy. Credible fiscal consolidation plans could 
help preempt sovereign debt concerns, which would be particularly damaging in countries 
where banks have substantial exposure to sovereigns. Beyond the short term, the region will 

need to find new growth engines, as the growth model of the boom yearsŠdriven by capital 

inflows, rapid credit growth, and domestic demand boomsŠwill need to shift toward greater 
reliance on the tradable sector as an engine of growth.    Although the crisis in emerging Europe has been deep, the banking and currency crises 
that many had initially feared have largely been avoidedŠthe result of strong domestic 

policy responses, rapid and large-scale financing packages of international institutions, and 

the continued support of western banks (Chapter 3). The boom-bust cycle provides 
important lessons in crisis prevention. Although the crisis in emerging Europe was triggered 
by external factors (the recession in advanced Europe and the sudden stop in capital 

inflows), domestic imbalances and vulnerabilities played a key role. Indeed, countries that 
have largely managed to avoid the capital-inflows-driven credit and domestic demand booms have had a much less severe recession. 11.  Advanced Europe: Beyond Crisis 
ManagementWith strong policy action to contain sovereign debt 
problems in the euro area, the 
recovery continues. But lingering 
uncertainties and market pressu
res make for moderate and 
unequal growth across advanced E
urope. In the short term, in addition to dealing with weak banks and supportive monetary 

policy, this calls for credible fiscal consolidation, adjusted to 

country needs and designed to minimize the impact on growth. 
It will be just as important to address the governance issues 

revealed by the crisis. Better fi
scal frameworks at the national 
and the EU levels will enhance the credibility of fiscal 

adjustment. And energizing and coordinating structural 

policies should help sustain and balance growth, supporting 
public finances in the longer term. Although the political economy of such reforms is complicated, they promise a much 

stronger Europe. Policymakers should seize the moment and 
act boldly.The Recovery Continues 
The Recovery Has Withstood 
Sovereign Debt Troubles . . .  The recovery in advanced Europe is well into its 
fourth quarter, but it was not an easy year. The eruption of sovereign debt troubles in early 2010 
threatened confidence and shook a still weak 

financial system. Triggered by Greece™s public debt 

problems, fiscal sustainability concerns quickly 

spread in the euro area 
and beyondŠfirst to other 
southern European countries and Ireland, then 

more widelyŠand euro area interbank markets 
seized up once more. Yet, as the euro weakened and 
global stock markets tumbled, policy actions helped 
contain the problem and the recovery endured 
(Figure 1).  Far-reaching policy interventions were crucial.

Greece time to put its public finances in order. 
However, when sovereign and financial markets did 

not calm immediately and tensions escalated to 

dangerous levels (Figure 2), even stronger measures 

were required. In early May, the European Central 

Bank (ECB) installed a Securities Markets Program

 governments established 
the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to provide 

the means and a mechanism to support 
governments and preserve financial stability. The 
ECB has accumulated some •61 billion through the 

SMP between May and September, albeit at 
relatively low levels recently. The European 
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which at a 

nominal •440 billion provides for the bulk of the 

ESM™s funding capacity, has been operational since early August. In addition, the ECB has taken steps 

to bolster liquidity, including with the help of central 
bank swap arrangements, in U.S. dollar markets. 
. . . But Proceeds Unevenly 
 In many countries, the second bout of crisis 
slowed the rebound, and real GDP levels remain 
well below their precrisis peaks (Figure 3). With few 
exceptions, advanced European countries have seen 

output recuperating much slower than in the United 

States. By mid-2010, GDP in the United Kingdom, 

Sweden, and the majority of euro area countries 

remained well below its precrisis level, with those hit 

hardest by the crisis lagging behind even further. 
 The lack of momentum is also visible in the 
composition of growth. Looking at the euro area, 
while growth was strong in the second quarter of 
2010, driven mostly by Germany, this reflected the 

unfreezing of past investme
nt decisions rather than 
increasing overall momentum (Figure 4). Exports 
continued to lift growth also, driven by some of the 

same temporary factors operating at the global 

levelŠstronger overall expansions in other regions 

of the world, and the euro™s depreciation earlier in 

the year. However, the euro™s weakening (later 

reversed, to some degree) was also a worrying sign 

of changing financial market sentiment in light of 

fiscal and financial problems. Indeed, financial growth conditions tipped down slightly after a long 
period of improvement (Figure 5). These 

developments, combined with high unemployment 

in parts of the region and volatile confidence, 

contributed to lackluster domestic consumption and 

investment. And while an expansionary budget in 

Germany continues to buoy growth, the crisis-
induced front-loading of budget consolidation in 

southern Europe has started to impact aggregate 
public consumption and investment. 
The Outlook Remains for Moderate 
Growth . . . 
 Against this background, 
the forecast remains for 
a very modest expansion. 
Real GDP is projected to 
expand at 1.7 percent in 2010 and 1.5 in 2011 in the 

euro area (Table 1). At this speed, the euro area will 

continue to trail the United States and Asia™s 
emerging economies. In part, these growth 
differentials are due to the lingering impact of the 

crisis and the accelerating fiscal adjustment in 2011. 

But they also reflect well-known structural rigidities 

in the labor, product, and service markets that will 

limit the euro area™s potential growth now that the inventory cycle has run its course. 
 Intra-European growth differentials are set to 
widen. At between -2.6 and 0.7 percent in 2011, 

growth in Greece, Portugal, and Spain is projected

economies, reflected also in diverging labor market 

developments that could lead to higher long-term or 

structural unemployment (Figure 6). As discussed 
earlier (IMF, 2010g), these differences are driven by 
the deflation of precrisis asset and credit booms and 

the degree to which countries™ export sectors profit 

from the rebound in global trade. Fiscal austerity 

may have been a critical crisis reaction and 

prevented things from getting worse where market 

pressures were the highest. But this austerity, 

combined with elevated interest rate spreads, is also 

taking its toll on growth.

Note: The FinancialConditions Index (FCI)is a summary measure of 
developments in various financial variables and their impact on growth 

four quarters ahead. Higher readings imply easier financial conditions 
and higher growth. The FCI is constructed as the weighted average of 
euroarea-wide measures of the real short-term interest rate, the term 

spread, the risk spread, equity market capitalization, and the real 

effective exchange rate, with the weights based on the coefficient 
estimates of a regression of real GDP growth on these variables.
Figure 5. Euro Area: Financial Conditions Index, 
January 2003ŒAugust 2010
(July 1999 =0)
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 4partly offset by a still depreciated currency (more 
than 20 percent in real effective terms since the 

beginning of the crisis), the United Kingdom is 

likely to see growth of about 1.7 percent in 2010 and 

2.0 percent in 2011. Switzerland, facing opposite 
circumstances of a stable fiscal outlook and a 
strongly appreciated safe-haven currency, should see 

growth of around 2.9 percent in 2010 and 1.7 in 

2011. Sweden, which also operates at very moderate 

deficit levels and has seen financial growth 

conditions improving since the early phase of the 

crisis, can expect real GDP to expand by 

approximately 4.4 percent in 2010, among the 

strongest performances in Europe, cooling down to 
2.6 percent in 2011.  
 Although the forecast is not without upside risks, 
downside risks have increased, with some of these 

being associated with the way in which announced 

policies are (or are not) implemented. The positive 

growth surprise in Germany could provide additional short-term thrust to the recovery by 
boosting private demand, and activity in the United 

States or emerging Asia might still exceed 

expectations. At the same time, however, global 

growth could very well be weaker than predicted, 

with a tail risk of a double-dip recession. Renewed 

volatility in European financial and sovereign 

markets is also a possibility.  More than ever, however, the recovery depends 
on policymakers getting it just right: fiscal 
consolidation, while inevitable, must seek to 

minimize the negative impact on growth and 

employment; monetary policy must steer between 
the need to normalize policies on the one hand and 
the necessity to mitigate sovereign market volatility 

and ensure bank liquidity on the other; and the 
recent checkup of European banks must be 

followed by rapid action to eliminate remaining 

weaknesses while safeguarding lending capacity. In 

addition, to stabilize the confidence of financial 

markets, consumers, and investors beyond the short 

term, EU and euro area governance will need to 
improve fundamentally (see below). 
. . . With (Mostly) Low Inflationary 
Pressure Inflation will remain low in most of advanced 
Europe. In the euro area, with the output gap slowly 

closing, headline inflation is expected to rise to 

1.6 percent in 2010 and 1.5 percent in 2011 

(Figure 7). Long-term inflation expectations remain 
well anchored at about 2 percent, close to the ECB™s 
comfort zone. Switzerland, which has seen its 

currency appreciate in real terms since the beginning 
of the crisis, is expected to see very low inflation 

rates below 1 percent in both years. In contrast, in

surprisingly high following a series of price level 

shocks and the strong depreciation of the pound, 

inflation is expected to nudge higher, averaging 3.1 

in 2010 and 2.5 in 2011. Sweden, despite its more 
volatile growth path, will show more steady inflation 
of just below 2 percent in both years. 
Policies to Sustain the Upswing  Massive policy intervention has helped stabilize 

Europe™s economies during the recession, but 

managing the recovery is just as demanding. The 

task of securing growth and containing risks 
involves financial and monetary policies andŠ
cruciallyŠfiscal action. Financial Sector Cleanup Not to Be Delayed . . .  
 The recent sovereign bond market volatility has 
made dealing with remaining weakness in the 

banking sector even more urgent. In the euro area, 

banks™ holdings of government paper tightly link 
perceived sovereign and financial sector risks 
(Figure 8), limiting access to interbank lending for 
some institutions. In addition, banks face the 

anticipated (if phased-in) increase in regulatory 

capital, continued problems of low profitability, high 

loan loss provisions, and low capital ratios. These 
factors are fueling concerns about a credit crunch 
(IMF, 2010d). Indeed, with aggregate flows of 

corporate credit yet to show consistent signs of life, 

there are indications that smaller firms lacking access 

to bond-based financing could be constrained on 
the credit market (IMF, 2010b, Chapter 1) (Figures 
9A and 9B).  This summer™s EU-wide stress tests provide a 
road map. The tests were well coordinatedŠ

implemented in just four weeks, encompassing more 

than 90 banks from 19 member states, representing 
about two-thirds of the EU banking sector assetsŠ
and provided a wealth of information for financial 

markets (Table 2). The next step is to follow up by

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 6resolving, restructuring, or recapitalizing the banks 
identified as vulnerable (IMF, 2010d, Chapter 1). 

Early progress in that direction in Spain, where an 

existing government program was available to shore 

up banks where needed, have rightly been welcomed 

by the markets. However, similar action is required 

elsewhere, including in some cases for banks that 

only narrowly cleared the hurdle. 
. . . And Monetary Policy to Remain 
Supportive and Flexible  With financial sector strengthening on its way and 
little inflationary pressure on the horizon, monetary 

policy can and should remain supportive and 

flexible. For example, while the ECB seems 

comfortable with market forces bringing overnight 

rates up closer to the level of the policy rate at times, 

it has signaled its intention to keep the policy rate 
low. Moreover, with the risk balance of the recovery 
having shifted downward and fiscal policy options 

increasingly limited, the ECB should remain ready to 

adjust the time horizon of its low-interest-rate policy 

and redeploy extraordinary monetary measures if the 

recovery should stall unexpectedly. The Bank of 

England, in turn, has appropriately maintained a 

very expansionary stance and indicated that it will 

respond flexibly to incoming data, while paying 
close attention to the risk that recent above-target 
inflation outturns might adversely affect medium-

term inflation expectations. In Switzerland, the main 

policy challenge will be to allow interest rates to 

increase over time, in an environment where the 

currency faces appreciation pressures. 
 The same flexibility should govern the exit from 
extraordinary crisis measures. Liquidity operations, 

such as the ECB™s full allotment refinancing, are still 

needed in light of the recent fiscal and financial 

sector turbulence, but their benefits should be 
balanced against the cost of distorting marked-based 
bank financing, the moral hazard invited by 

unlimited liquidity provision, and the risks 

accumulating on central bank balance sheets 

(Figure 10). This suggests a resumption of the 

gradual exit once systemic liquidity conditions have 

reliably returned to normal. In the same vein, the 

ECB will have to tread carefully when phasing out 

its sovereign bond purchases. The task of exiting 
from these particular crisis measures should be 
made easier with the ESM now operational. 
Fiscal Policy Must Focus on 
Consolidation without Jeopardizing the 

Recovery 
 Getting fiscal consolidation right is the most 
crucial of the short-term tasks facing Europe™s 

policymakersŠand among the most difficult. The 

current willingness of governments to support 

demand through higher deficits is still an important 

ingredient of the recovery (Table 3). And if growth weakened markedly more than projected, additional 
support might yet be needed. However, this is

.ADVANCED EUROPE: BEYOND CRISIS MANAGEMENT 7subject to there being fiscal space and market 
acceptanceŠit is precisely the fear that increasing 

debt could make public finances unsustainable that 

could put the recovery at risk. Elevated interest rate 

spreads and a steady stream of rating downgrades 
(or the fear thereof) serve as a case in point. The 
solution is a strong and credible fiscal consolidation 

effort, suitably phased in, differentiated across 

countries in size, speed, and timing (depending on 

existing market pressures), and designed to minimize 

the negative impact on growth and employment that 

comes with the reduction of government deficits. 
 Deficits are being reduced in many countries, 
with efforts broadly mirroring the pressure felt in 
sovereign bond markets (Figure 11). Among the 
countries scrutinized by markets most, Ireland has 
started early, but Spain and Portugal have recently 

also implemented ambitious and front-loaded 

consolidation efforts, with the announcement of 

additional efforts in the future. In Greece, the 
government is on track to reduce its deficit by about 
5½ percentage points of GDP in 2010 in line with 

the guidelines agreed with the EU and IMF. 
 But the summer™s budget season has also brought 
signs of fiscal consolidation elsewhere in Europe. 

This is most visible in the United Kingdom, where 
the new government has laid out a strong 
consolidation agenda. France, too, has announced 

measures to significantly reduce the deficit over the 

next three years. Also, Italy has approved a fiscal

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 8consolidation package, based on expenditure 
savings, aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit to below 

3 percent by 2012. Appropriately, countries with 

better starting positions are approaching the task at 

a slower pace. Germany, for example, has let its 

deficit increase in 2010, but plans to bring the 

general government deficit under the Stability and 

Growth Pact (SGP) limit by 2013, at the latest. For 
the euro area as a whole, the fiscal stance is about 
neutral in 2010, turning mildly contractionary in 

2011 (Table 3). 
 Although the overall fiscal path is broadly in line 
with the need to support the recovery, securing its 

credibility will require additional work. In some 
cases, the underlying macroeconomic assumptions 
will need to be changed. And in many countries the 

details behind the announced consolidation effort 

remain to be specified, allowing uncertainty about 

the actual size and nature of the adjustment to 

persist. Some countriesŠsuch as Greece, Portugal, 

and Spain, but also France, Germany, Italy, and the 

United KingdomŠhave already elaborated their 

consolidation plans beyond next year; others have 
yet to start that process.  Designing fiscal consolidation to minimize the 
negative impact on growth and employment is just 

as imperative. Cutting government spending or 
increasing taxes to reduce a deficit will generally 
have a detrimental impact on aggregate demand and 

GDP growth in the short term. However, 
households and firms affected by these measures 
will adjust their demand and supply decisions to the 
government™s actions, and, based on the precise 
composition of the fiscal consolidation package, this 

adjustment could mitigate the short-term impact on 

economic activity (Box 1). For example, a lasting 

reduction in public spending might convince 

households that future taxation will be lower and 

permanent net income higher, which can bolster 

private demand. Indeed, the historical record 

suggests that credible expenditure-based 
consolidations tend to be associated with lower 
GDP reduction and lower unemployment than tax-

based consolidations, especially when investment 

spending cuts are avoided (IMF, 2010i, Chapter 3).  
 Compared with this benchmark, the expected 
structure of consolidation in the euro area and other 
European countries is broadly reassuring 
(Figure 12). The vast majority of euro area members™ 

fiscal adjustment plans are based on either mostly 

expenditure cuts or a broadly balanced mix of 

expenditure and revenue cuts, and the picture for 

other advanced European economies is fairly 

similar. That said, to maximize long-term fiscal 

sustainability gains and minimize any short-term 

impact on growth, adjustments should generally

ADVANCED EUROPE: BEYOND CRISIS MANAGEMENT 9Box 1. Fiscal Consolidation: Minimizing Side Effects 
Public debts and deficits in most advanced economies are unsustainable. Large adjustments are needed to 
preserve, and in some cases restore, confidence in the ability of governments to face current and future 
obligations, including the payment of pensions and the guarantee of acceptable health care for all.  
Does the situation imply a need for shock therapy? Or could softer treatments work? And is there a way to 
minimize side effects? The debate on this issue is ongoing,
 but two salient truths have emerged. First, denying 
the need to adjust or unduly delaying adjustment are not viable options, despite the difficult choices that lie 
ahead. Second, the economic literature, regardless of th
e methodologies used, suggests that certain therapies 
entail less unpleasant short-term side effects than others. 
By far the most feared side effect of fiscal retrenchment is that sharp cuts in government spending or tax 
increases would reduce aggregate demand to a point that could cause a relapse into recession. However, an 
ample literature has qualified the simple Keynesian version of the argument, suggesting the existence of 
feedback effects that depend on the phasing, composit
ion and institutional underpinnings of the adjustment 
strategy. In principle, fiscal adjustment can have expa
nsionary effects that work from both supply and demand 
sides.On the supply side, lower transfers to households may encourage job search, thereby reducing labor costs and 
boosting employment. By contrast, labor tax hikes would have the opposite effect, and cuts in public 
investment could dampen private investment (if private output depends in part on public capital). This 
illustrates very clearly the importance of the composition of the adjustment, pointing to the likely superiority of 
selected spending cuts over tax increases. That said, if 
the scale of the adjustment requires revenue measures in 
addition to spending cutsŠas is likely to be the case in a number of countriesŠincreases in indirect taxes 
should generally be preferred, especially in an environment where tax rates are at already high levels, firms have 
little or no pricing power, and where monetary policy is likely to remain expansionary or neutral for some time.
On the demand side, adjustments may have positive effects on private expenditure if agents believed that a no-
adjustment scenario would lead to catastrophic outcomes and much more damaging consolidations in the 
future (Blanchard, 1990). Compared with a scenario of no or late adjustment, this would lead to lower 
precautionary savings, lower interest rates, and a lower probability of negative shocks to wealth. This would 
ultimately lead to higher consumption and investment. As a consequence, early adjustments are likely to be less 
painful in terms of foregone demand than textbook linear multipliers may suggest. 
The extent to which policymakers succeed in devising adjustment strategies that minimize the side effects of 
fiscal consolidation is largely an empirical question. Th
ere is considerable empirical evidence that large and 
persistent changes in fiscal policy are indeed associated with strong offsetting forces, to the point of making 
fiscal contractions expansionary (see Giavazzi, Japelli, and Pagano, 2000, for a comprehensive cross-country 
analysis). Composition appears to matter a great deal, wi
th expenditure-based adjustment being more likely to 
trigger only a small negative or even a positive response of output (Alesina and Ardagna, 2009; and Giudice, 
Turrini, and in™t Veld, 2007). More recent evidence using real-time data on policy actions strikes a note of 
caution on the strength of non-Keynesian effects, suggesting that most consolidations lead to some output loss 
(IMF, 2010b). But the study also confirms that expenditure-based adjustmentsŠespecially those relying on 
transfersŠare likely to hurt the economy less than revenue-based adjustments. The same applies to countries 
under market pressure, pointing to the important role of particularly adverse counterfactuals in the absence of 
adjustment. –continued–Note: The main author of this box is Xavier Debrun. 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 10 
avoid reducing investment, including in education, 
and focus instead on distortive subsidies and better 
targeting social transfers. Entitlement reforms such 

as increasing the effective retirement age along the 

lines of France™s recently announced plans will not 

only deliver cost savings but also support aggregate 

demand by increasing lifetime income and 
consumption. 
Steps to Complete the European House The financial crisis and sovereign debt troubles 
have revealed a number of gaps in the governing 
framework supporting financial marketsŠin the EU 
and the euro area. As envisaged by the EU™s architects, building the ﬁEuropean Houseﬂ was to be 

a work in progress, with some parts to be completed 

faster than others. However, while the development 

of the single goods market built upon an appropriate 
structure of intensifying coordination and gradual 
centralization of competition policies, financial 

integration outpaced the development of a common 

financial stability framework.  
 Moreover, it has become clear that the 
institutional safeguards put in place to support the 
functioning of the common currency in the areas of 
Box 1. (concluded)
How do fiscal adjustment plans in Europe fare compared
 with these broad criteria? In current circumstances, 
theory and empirical evidence suggest that adjustments should be (i) phased in (except when credibility has 
been lost as evidenced by market pressure), and (ii) expenditure based. Surveying current plans, the adjustment 
looks broadly appropriate (see figures below). First, the size and degree of front-loading of the proposed 
adjustment clearly reflect the magnitude of the initial problem (Ireland, the United Kingdom) and the extent of 
market pressures (Ireland, Portugal
, Spain). Second, expenditure plays a considerable role in the planned 
retrenchment, especially in countries under strong market pressure. That said, the credibility of the adjustment 
plans could be improved. Although a number of countries have already backed their adjustment plans by 
clearly identifying or already adopting measures beyond the very short term, others have yet to do so, leaving 
room for uncertainty about the actual size and nature of the adjustment. 
Overall, fiscal consolidations currently planned or implemented in Europe are mostly in line with a few key 
features that the economic literature tends to associate with successful and growth-friendly fiscal adjustments.

fiscal and structural policy have been less than 
complete. The SGP, lacking both effective 

surveillance and enforcement, largely failed to 

deliver the kind of ﬁgood-timesﬂ fiscal discipline that 

would have lowered debt levels and secured fiscal space for when it was needed. Efforts to accelerate 
and coordinate structural reforms in labor, service, 
and product markets under the Lisbon agenda also 

fell short, so there was little improvement in the 

euro area™s ability to deal 
with intra-area imbalances 
in the absence of nominal exchange rate flexibility.  Policymakers have scrambled to make the most 
of the opportunity posed by the crisis to fill these 

gapsŠbut the momentum has differed across policy 

areas. The completion of the financial stability 

framework is clearly farthest advanced (Box 2). In 

contrast, the discussion on how to improve fiscal 

governance is ongoing and the least tangible 

progress is visible in the area of structural policies. 

There is widespread consensus, however, among 
policymakers and observers alike, that it will take a 
wholehearted effort along all three dimensions to 

sustain confidence in the recovery and the long-term 

success of European integration. 
Completing the Push for European Supervision and Macroprudential 
Policies In the most visible sign of progress along these 
lines, the forthcoming establishment of European 

Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) will bring long-

desired tighter coordination of financial supervision 

within the EU and euro area. As the crisis amply 
demonstrated, financial risks travel quickly across 
European borders and markets, and the desire of 

national authorities to act alone can add to the 

uncertainty and confusion of financial markets in 

times of turbulence. While shortcomings in the 

financial stability framework remainŠin particular 

in the area of crisis resolutionŠthe new institutional 

arrangements constitute significant progress by 

providing a European platform for cross-border 
information sharing, rulemaking and 
implementation, and supervision. 
 The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), also 
set to be established in 2011, is another important 

step in that direction. The ESRB should provide 

essential coordination in crisis prevention across 

countries and markets, including by guiding 
preventive macroprudential policies to prevent the 
buildup of liquidity and credit risks. Given that the 

ESRB will operate with limited resources and 

without own policy tools, a key to its success will be 

access to information and effective interaction with 

other European and national policymakers. Given 

their joint European mandate, the ESRB will also 

profit from a strong coordinating role of the ESAs. 
Strengthening Fiscal Governance  Fiscal governance reform is coming into focus 

amidst extensive discussion.1 The van Rompuy task 
force on economic governance installed by the 

European Council,2 the European Commission, and 
the ECB all have supported the necessary 
strengthening and widening of financial and 

nonfinancial sanctions to ensure compliance not 

only with the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), 

but also with the requirements under the preventive 

arm of the SGP. More effective enforcement is 
crucial and should go along with sound economic 

judgment in the application of rules. An excellent 

example is the proposed extension of the EDP™s 
focus beyond formal compliance with the deficit 
ceiling on troublesome debt dynamics. There is also 

the notion of introducing or bolstering national 

fiscal rules conforming to EU targets as recently in 

Germany and under consideration in France and 

elsewhere. Finally, there is the welcome suggestion 

to equip the euro area with permanent crisis 

management capabilities, 
with current proposals 
leaning toward transforming the EFSF into a 
permanent scheme. But while the ECB has called 
for a ﬁquantum leapﬂ in reforms, the Commission 

and the task force prefer somewhat less ambitious

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 12 
Box 2. Toward a More Integrated Financial Stability Framework for the EU 
The EU™s new financial stability framework is taking shape. In recent months, final agreement has been reached 
on a more integrated supervisory framework, and the Commission has announced plans for greater 
harmonization and cooperation in the areas of crisis management and resolution, as well as deposit insurance. 
These are important steps toward the integrated financial stability framework that the EU™s single financial 
market needs. 
The New Supervisory and Regulatory Framework 
The EU™s new supranational supervisory and regulatory framework will formally be established on January 1, 
2011. It comprises macroprudential and microprudential institutions, brought together in a European System of 
Financial Supervisors (ESFS), and new rule-making procedures. It offers the opportunity for a fundamental shift 
toward dealing with risks to financial stability at the EU level.  
Macroprudential Supervision The ESFS™s macroprudential body is the European Sy
stemic Risk Board (ESRB), which will be closely linked 
organizationally to the European Central Bank (ECB). The ESRB will not have binding powers but it will have a 
broad mandate to issue risk warnings and recommendations to European or national authorities. Follow-up will 
be sought through an ﬁact or explainﬂ rule and through the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). 
The latter and the microprudential authorities will likely be the ESRB™s main counterparts. 
The modus operandi of the ESRB still remains to be clarified. Ideally, its agenda should cover at least three 
broad areas of risk, namely those related to (i) the largest and most interconnected financial institutions; (ii) 
financial imbalances, such as credit-fueled asset bubbles, at the aggregate level and for particular countries or 
sectors; and (iii) changes in the structure and technology of the financial system. 
Microprudential Supervision The microprudential arm of the ESFS comprises the existing national supervisors, three new sectoral European 
Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), and a cross-sectoral Joint Committee.
1 The ESAs will be charged with 
harmonizing supervisory practices, and will have binding powers to mediate and settle disputes between 
supervisors. Cross-border groups will be supervised by standardized colleges of national supervisors in which 
the ESAs will have an enabling role. Compared with the Level 3 committees under the Lamfalussy structure that 
they will replace, the ESAs will have increased resources, greater powers, and improved governance systems. 
Key challenges they will face include making judicious use of their binding powers, establishing a workable 
balance between these powers and the scope of the fiscal safeguard clause,
2 achieving effective and harmonized 
oversight of cross-border groups through the colleges, building a systemwide 
esprit de corps, and ensuring that 
information flows freely within the system to all who are entitled to it. In this regard, a general review of the 
appropriate level of confidentiality of prudential data is
 warranted, given how a perceived lack of transparency 
has exacerbated the crisis in Europe.
Note: The main author of this box is Wim Fonteyne. 
1 The three ESAs are the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA), and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). 
2 The fiscal safeguard clause states that the ESAs should make sure that their decisions do not impinge in any 
way on the fiscal responsibilities of Member States. The scope of this clause will likely be established by 
precedent, through Council decisions in particular cases.
ADVANCED EUROPE: BEYOND CRISIS MANAGEMENT 13 
Rule Making The ESAs are expected to work toward establishing a single rulebook for the financial sector. To do so, they will 
be able to establish technical regulatory and implementing standards that will be given force of law by the 
Commission and that will be directly applicable in the member states. The work of the ESAs is expected to be 
complemented by efforts, led by the Commission, to achieve greater harmonization in existing and future 
legislation. This legislative work will be essential for the emergence of a true single rulebook, including because it 
will determine the extent to which the ESAs can establish technical standards. As in the past, many key elements 
of the rulebook will be based on international standards. Notably, ﬁBasel 3ﬂ is expected to constitute the basis 
for the EU™s regulatory reforms in the banking sector. 
Crisis Management and Resolution 
Progress in crisis management and resolution is slow
er and more complex than on the supervisory front. The 
Commission™s approaches amount mainly to harmonizing and improving national systems, and leaving the 
question of integrated frameworks to be revisited in 2014 along with the planned review of the supervisory 
arrangements. However, the European Parliament is insisting on quicker and more substantial progress. 
As outlined in a May 26 position paper,
3 the Commission intends to seek the EU-wide introduction of 
harmonized early intervention tools, bank resolution regimes, national resolution funds, and deposit guarantee 
schemes. Harmonization would strengthen national regimes and improve their interoperability, but additional 
work toward a separate EU-wide regime for cross-border financial institutions is also urgent. Meanwhile, the 
European Parliament on July 7, 2010, adopted a resolution requesting the Commission to come up with a 
legislative proposal for an integrated framework by end-2010.
44IMF staff has argued for a European Resolution Authority (ERA) that is armed with the mandate and the tools 
to deal cost effectively with failing cross-border banks. This ERA should be supported by an industry-financed 
European Deposit Insurance and Resolution Fund (EDIRF) and a fiscal backstop. Given the fundamental 
reforms that would be needed to establish such a system, it is important that preparatory work start without 
delay and that the main parameters of the long-term system be established as early as possible. 
Deposit Insurance 
On July 12, 2010, the Commission adopted a legislative proposal on deposit guarantee schemes (DGS).
5 The 
basic thrusts of the proposal are harmonization of systems and coverage (at •100,000); standardized funding 
relying primarily on ex ante, risk-based contributions by banks; a mutual lending duty between systems; and an 
oversight role for the EBA. The Commission deferred making a decision on a pan-European scheme and wants 
to keep deposit insurance and resolution funds separate. It envisages DGS paying up to the level of the insured 
deposits in resolution cases. DGS would also be obliged to lend to each other when liquidity needs arise and 
have back-up liquidity arrangements in place. However, the draft directive does not have provisions for back-up 
solvency support and leaves the question of government responsibility for shortfalls open.

approaches that could be implemented more quickly and securely within the existing EU treaty. 
 Either way, the reform of the fiscal framework 
will need to entail a shift of policy authority to the 

center. A stronger center would make surveillance 

more effective, which could help to detect problems 

early and align policies in a key area of common 

concern. The planned introduction of a ﬁEuropean 

semesterﬂ in 2011 is a useful step in that direction. 

This proposal includes intensified monitoring of 

medium-term budgetary strategies and policy advice 
from the Council and European Council (anchored 
by a Commission report) to national governments 

timed to influence the budgets for the following 

year. A stronger center could also help the 

enforcement of EDP and SGP rules. Here the 

Commission, as guardian of Europe™s treaties, could 

play a larger role in guiding the process, to provide a 

better balance with individual national interests, 

toward the more effective implementation of 
common fiscal rules. A larger role for the center 
could be supported by a larger central budget which 

would aim to provide, among other things, 

insurance against asymmetric country shocks 

through larger transfers and additional incentives for 

favorable economic and structural policies by giving 

strong performers enhanced access to EU funds. 
The resources for a larger central budget could come 

from higher VAT taxes, with the proceeds going to 
the center, or possibly from a tax on carbon 
emissions.A Framework and Policies for 
Sustained and Balanced Growth 
Accelerating structural reform policies and 
effectively coordinating them is clearly the greatest 

governance challenge faci
ng EU and euro area policymakers. Some countries have moved ahead in 
the wake of the crisis. For example, Greece has 
recently passed substantive labor market reforms 

and is set to liberalize professional services and to 

lift regulatory barriers in tourism and retail, and 

Spain has taken important steps to improve the 
flexibility of its labor market.
3 However, the overall 
track record is meager at best.
4 The euro area™s collective commitment to structural reforms under 

the Lisbon agenda, relying on soft coordination and 

peer review, has produced disappointing results, in 
particular in the labor markets. As a result, potential 
growth remains too low in most countries and large 

differences in structural competitiveness persist, 

leading to differences in growth and unbalanced 

trade. Any strategy devised to finally overcome these 

problems will not only have to identify the most 

promising areas for reform, it will also have to 
address the governance problems that so far have 

stood in the way of implementing them.  
 Most EU and euro area countries could improve 
their structural characteristics along a number of 

dimensions compared with the U.S. benchmark 
(Figure 13), but comprehensive measures to 

improve market flexibility promise the most 

significant gains. For example, abolishing the 
privileges of protected professions in the services 
sector or remaining rigidities in product markets will 

have a stronger impact on employment when they 

are met by a flexible labor supply supported by 

adequate but not excessive employment protection 

(Figure 14).5 Portugal and (pre-reform) Greece and 
Spain remain among those with the highest potential 

to grow employment in this regard, reflecting their 

still fairly segmented and inflexible labor markets 
and limitations in the business environment (Box 3). 
But similar reforms could also profit a country such 

as Germany, where the service sector remains 
_______ 
3 Among other things, Greece has reduced severance costs for 
white-collar workers and increased considerably the threshold 
for activating rules for collective dismissals. See Jaumotte 
(forthcoming) for a di
scussion of Spain. 
4 See, among others, European Commission (2008) and 
IMF (2010b, Chapter 3). 5 This is easily illustrated in Figure 14: for any country or 
starting combination of labor 
and product market flexibility, a 
simultaneous reform (moving stra
ight north-east) will increase

relatively small, being stifled by restrictions, high

 The rewards of comprehensive reforms can be 
large: IMF (2010c) simulations suggest that the 

growth impact could be as high as ½ percentage

 In addition to bolstering growth, more flexible

to product and labor markets. Although market

competitiveness, these adjustments can take a very 

long time. And indeed, there is evidence that 

bilateral trade imbalances (that is, the absolute size 

of deficits or surpluses) within the euro area have 

increased and become more persistent since the late 

1990s, reaching levels last seen during the Bretton 
Woods period (Figure 15).  
 But policymakers are not without choices. 
Imbalances tend to be smaller and less permanent 

among euro area countries characterized by more 

flexible labor and product markets, and countries 

with higher relative market flexibility often have 
lower trade deficits (Berger and Nitsch, 
forthcoming) (Figures 16A and 16B). Making labor 

markets more flexible, supported by complementary 
reforms such as improved portability of pensions 

and active labor market policies, could also serve to 

enhance labor mobility between countries, which will further ease the adjustment to shocks (Wasmer 

and Janiak, 2008). 
 Reforms will be most effective when coordinated 
across countries. Labor market reforms currently 

remain the prerogative of national governments. By 

contrast, many facets of product and service markets 

regulation are determined jointly at the EU level. 

Regional coordination could help the 

implementation of comprehensive reforms across 
markets. Coordination is also key when it comes to 
ensuring the proper mix of structural and 
macroeconomic policies in the euro area. Structural 

policies that succeed in reducing differences in 

economic andŠin particularŠinflationary 

developments within the euro area will make the 

ECB™s monetary policy a better fit for all member 

countries (Figure 17). And the ECB will be more 

inclined to keep interest rates low and accommodate

Box 3. Why Is Economic Growth Lagging in Europe and What Can Be Done About It? 
Convergence of European GDP per capita toward U.S. 
levels stopped in the early 1980s, leaving a persistent level 
gap of close to 30 percent (figure at right). Convergence of 
output per capita levels was swift during the postwar period, 
driven by catch-up growth, technology assimilation, product 
standardization, trade liberalization, and economies of scale. 
However, the process of convergence slowed markedly and 
even reversed somewhat after the 1970s.  
Lower per capita income in the euro area reflects, to 
different degrees, lower labor utilization and to a lesser 
extent lower hourly productivity. The reason for the shortfall 
in GDP per capita vis-à-vis the United States differs 
markedly across the euro area (second figure). For Germany 
and France, and some smaller euro area countries, the 
shortfall is mostly due to lower labor market utilization. 
Hourly productivity in these two countries is similar or ev
en slightly higher than in the United States. For 
southern European countries, however, productivity is re
latively worse than in the United States in addition 
to labor utilization being lower. 
Although differences in hours worked could reflect preferences, reducing unemployment and raising labor 
participation would significantly reduce the income gap with the United States. Lower labor utilization not 
only reflects that people work fewer hours but also that unemployment is higher and participation weaker 
(and this is not necessarily by choice). As can be seen from the second figure, improving employment and 
labor market participation could close the GDP per capita gap with the United States by about 
10 percentage points.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 18 
Box 3. (concluded)
Addressing the euro area™s reform gaps would help to close the GDP gap (table). All but a few euro area 
countries exhibit severe labor market rigidities compared with their advanced economy peers, including the 
United States. Binding regulations for businesses and in
 the services sectors are also prevalent across the 
euro area while southern countries are lagging in terms of human capital, institutions and contracts, a result 
that is consistent with the productivity gap in th
e subregion underscored earlier. Moreover, once the core 
euro area countries achieve higher labor utilization and solve productivity issues, they will also need to deal 
with impediments to long-term growth and promote innovation. 
To live up to its growth potential and ensure viability of its social model, the euro area must provide more 
jobs, with higher productivity. Complementary labor and services sector reforms will boost investment and 
growth. Initially, demand-friendly measures should include increasing the incentives to hire by lowering the 
tax burden on labor, stimulating employment of vulnerab
le categories, and freeing up retail trade, network 
industries, and the professional services sector. A successful reform package would combine (i) a shift from 
labor to VAT taxes, (ii) a reduction in the level and duration of unemployment benefits and in early and old-
age retirement schemes, and (iii) a reduction in entry barriers in network services (gas, electricity, telecoms), 
retail distribution, and professional services. In addition, fixing the financial system will be essential to avoid 
a credit crunch that would stifle economic recovery. For the longer term, focus should be on innovation and 
education, as well as on continuing financial sector reforms.

place everywhere in the euro area, promising higher

6And higher growth resulting from a well-

coordinated reform effort will facilitate fiscal 

consolidation across the region. This strengthens the 

case for integrating fiscal and structural policy 
making at the EU level. 
 Realizing these gains will require a well-
functioning structural governance framework. 

Taking a cue from the failure of the Lisbon agenda, 

any such framework should give a larger role to

surveillance, and include stronger reform incentives 
for national governments than in the past. Among the approaches floated by the European 

Commission, Council, and ECB, which all broadly 
follow these guidelines, is the proposal for an alarm 
system based on the timely surveillance of 
macroeconomic and competitiveness indicators. 

This alarm system would trigger the issuance of 

country-specific policy recommendations by the 

Commission and be backed by the EU budget. 

Under such a system, EU funds could perhaps be 

withheld from offenders or redirected to support 

structural reform efforts. Moreover, more explicitly 

integrating structural with fiscal surveillance in terms 
of timing (both should take place during the 
ﬁEuropean semesterﬂ) and calibration (SGP and 

EDP already allow taking into account the costs of 

structural reforms) would boost visibility and 

generate better outcomes overall.  
 Finally, similar to the area of fiscal policy, closing 
the structural governance gap will require 
governments to internalize the structural reform agenda at the national level. This should include the 

development of sufficiently ambitious and country-

specific reform agendas. There should also be a 

public commitment to see them through, perhaps

underlined by the establishment of independent 
commissions to monitor progress. 
 Completing the European House may not be 
easy, but it must and can be done. The two years 

that have elapsed since the collapse of Lehman 

Brothers have not only shown just how essential the 

improvement of governance will be for the long-

term success of European economic and monetary 

integration, but have also demonstrated that 

policymakers can act boldly when necessary. And 

now is the time to apply the same energy and 
determination to complete the EU™s and the euro area™s governance system. This will take a very 
determined effort. The political economy of the 

necessary reforms is complicated, with privileged 

households and firms pondering the consequences 

of coordinated structural reforms, national 
parliaments ambivalent about more intrusive fiscal 
surveillance at the EU level, and governments wary 

of a more assertive role for the European 

Commission. But closing the remaining governance 

gaps promises large benefits for the EU and beyond. 

With the memory of the crisis still fresh, 

policymakers should seize the moment and act 

boldly.21

GrowthEmergingEurope (EE)
7 is recovering from its deepest 
recession in the post-transition period. GDP in the region is 
likely to grow by 3.9 percent in 2010 and 3.8 percent in 

2011Ša marked difference from the 6 percent contraction in 

2009. The recovery is export-led, while domestic demand 

remains subdued, particularly in countries where the deflation 

of precrisis asset and credit booms has been most severe. 
Policymakers in emerging Europe face the difficult challenge of 
dealing with the legacies of the crisis, while not hurting the 
recovery. Fiscal consolidation is needed to bring down fiscal 

deficits, which rose sharply during the crisis, and remain high 

in 2010. To a large extent, these deficits are structural: 

although headline deficits were low in most countries before the 

crisis, a temporary boom in re
venues masked the underlying 
deterioration that resulted fr
om rapid expenditure growth. 
Beyond the short term, the region will need to find new growth 

engines, as the capital flo
ws-driven domestic demand boom 
needs to give way to more balanced growth. In sum, the region faces difficult adjustments in the short term, but the 
adjustments will help set the st
age for a more durable catch-up 
with advanced Europe.

EMERGING EUROPE: TOWARD SELF-SUSTAINED GROWTH 23 
(Figure 22). Private consumption shows signs of 
recovery in the first half of 2010 in a number of 

countries, but continued to decline on a quarter-on-

quarter basis in the Baltics, Bulgaria, Croatia, and 

Hungary (Figures 23 and 24).  
 There are several reasons for the weakness in 
domestic demand: Net capital inflows remain weak in most 
countries, and private sector credit growth is 

subdued. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) 
inflows are well below precrisis levels, and other 
investment flows are negative in many countries, 
notably in Bulgaria, Estonia, and Lithuania, likely 
reflecting continued deleveraging by banks and 
corporations. Private sector credit growth 
remains subdued as high nonperforming loans 
(NPLs) and funding costs (especially from 
overseas sources) are likely constraining loan 
supply (see section on reviving credit growth, 
page 34). 
Investment is likely to have been held back by 
excess capacity, as output is still below precrisis 
levels in most countries. This may be the case  
particularly in the nontradable sector, where the 
precrisis boom has come to an end (see also 
Chapter 3).  
Consumption is being restrained by poor labor 
market conditions, low confidence, and the 

destruction of consumer wealth. Real wages are 
falling in many countries (Figure 25), and the 
unemployment rate has increased sharply

(Figure 26). Private sector confidence remains 
low compared to historical levels, even after the 
recent improvement (Figure 27). Stock exchanges 

in the Baltics and Romania have lost about half 
their value (up to 80 percent in Bulgaria, since 
end-2007), and real estate prices are down some 
30 percent from their peak. 
Projections for 2010 Have Been Revised 
upŠalthough Differences within the 
Region Remain Substantial  For 2010 as a whole, output in the EE region is 
now projected to grow by 3.9 percent, a half 

percentage point upward revision from the 

projections in the April 2010 
World Economic Outlook(IMF, 2010h) and the May 2010 
Regional Economic Outlook: Europe
 (IMF, 2010g) (Table 4). The upward 
revision is largely the result of better-than-expected 

outcomes in the first half of 2010 and is in spite of 
this spring™s financial market turbulence. The 
regional growth average masks wide variations in 

prospects for individual countries or subregions, 

reflecting different economic structures and 

imbalances built up during the boom years. 
Growth Will Be Strongest in the European CIS Countries and Turkey  Russia and Ukraine are poised for relatively 
strong recoveries on the back of rebounding 
commodity prices. Strong growth in Russia will have 

spillover effects on the rest of the CIS subregion, 

whose links with Russia are far more important than 

with the euro area.

EMERGING EUROPE: TOWARD SELF-SUSTAINED GROWTH 25 
 Turkey is projected to post the highest growth 
rate in the region this year (7¾ percent). Prior to the 
crisis, the more restrained magnitude of foreign 

inflows, better focus of macro policies on leaning 

against the cyclical upswing, and a more restrictive 

regulatory environment for credit preserved the 

strength of bank and household balance sheets. 

ThisŠas well as weaker dependence on EE export 

markets (see Box 4)Šhelped Turkey set the stage 

for a strong rebound.  
Outside the CIS Countries and Turkey, Growth Will Be Weakest in the Countries 
That Had Deep Recessions and Strongest 
in Countries with Mild Recessions  The dichotomy in the recovery reflects the 
different nature of the downturn. Countries with the 
deepest recessions are those that experienced not 

just a decline in exports, but also a collapse of 

domestic demand, as the credit-fueled domestic 
demand boom of the precrisis years came to a

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 26 
Box 4. Emerging Europe Trade Linkages: The Pull from Within? 
The main export market for emerging
 Europe (EE) countries is EuropeŠadvanced and emerging (see figure 
below on left). On average, half of all EE exports go the euro area, while intraregional trade accounts for a 
further third of exports.  
Germany is a key market for EE countries, including through strong automotive industry linkages. About half of 
Hungarian exports go to GermanyŠequivalent to about 20 percent of GDP (see figure). Italy is another 
important export destination, particularly for southeastern Europe. Trade links with Russia are important for the 
BalticsŠRussia absorbs some 15 percent of exports from Latvia and Lithuania. Turkey is an important export 
market only for Bulgaria; more generally, Turkey™s intra-EE trade links are the second weakest among EE 
countriesŠonly 15½ percent of Turkey™s total exports go to the region. 
Direct and indirect exposures to the Asian market are both small. In 2008, 7 percent of all EE exports went to 
Asia, of which 40 percent went to China. In addition to Russia™s oil exports to China, wood, lumber, and cork, 
chemicals and fertilizers, metal and metal scrap account for about 80 percent of exports to the Chinese market. 
Indirect trade links raise the importance of Asia; about 10 percent of euro area exports go to Asia,
1 and it is likely 
that at least part of the inputs for these exports is imported from EE.   
However, Asia is playing an important role in the current recovery, as its contribution to export growth has been 
picking up sharply (second figure). Some of this historically high contribution is likely to be temporary, reflecting 
a postcrisis rebound in demand. However, indirect exposure to the Asian market (not accounted for in  
Note: The main author of this box is Ivanna Vladkova-Hollar.

20 percent if intra-euro area exports are excluded from the total.

been steadily rising, with transport equipment rising to over a quarter of total Chinese transport equipment

stand to benefit further from a growing luxury items

Latvia (where output fell the most in 2009 and is 

expected to decline once more in 2010), Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, and Romania. In 

contrast, countries that had the mildest downturn 
are now seeing the strongest recovery (Figure 28). 
The Recovery Is Expected to Broaden in 
2011 GDP growth for the region in 2011 is projected 
at 3.8 percent. Although the growth rate is virtually 

the same as in 2010, the recovery is expected to 

broaden, with all countries projected to see positive 

growth in 2011 (Table 4). Indeed, growth 
differentials among countries would be the lowest 
since 2006, with no country in recession and few 

standouts in terms of strong growth. The recovery is 

expected to broaden also in terms of drivers of 

growth: domestic demand is projected to contribute 

about 1.5Œ3.5 percentage points to growth in 2011 
in most countries; private consumption should 

resume positive growth, although it will likely  
remain subdued in Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, 
Lithuania, Romania, and Serbia (Table 4).

projected as financial conditions normalize, 
precautionary savings fall as household balance 

sheets improve, and firms raise investment more 

quickly than expected. The recovery in Germany in 

the second quarter of 2010 was particularly dynamic, 
and the much stronger growth outlook is likely to 
spill over to the region.  
. . . But Downside Risks Remain 
SignificantŠand Would Be Particularly 

Harmful if They Materialized 
 The main downside risk for emerging Europe is 
the revival of sovereign stress in advanced Europe, 
which could depress growth in the euro area and 
lead to adverse spillovers for the region: 
Transmission to emerging Europe would be not 
only through lower exports; lower growth in the 

euro area could also increase banking sector 

stress in advanced Europe, and reduce capital 
flows to emerging Europe, delaying the revival of 
credit growth and domestic demand. If reduced 
capital inflows were to be accompanied by 
depreciation of domestic currencies, household 

and corporate balance sheet mismatches could further weigh on the recovery.
11It would be even more harmful if the market 
turbulence itself were to spill over to emerging 
Europe. The consequences of such sovereign risk 
contagion would include both higher financing 
costs and greater difficulty in financing still high 

deficits. In addition, financial sectors would be 
particularly affected, especially in those countries 
where banks hold a large portion of their assets in 
the form of government securities (Albania, 
Hungary, Poland, and Turkey). In such countries, 

bank capitalization could be significantly 
impacted if the value of government securities 
declined. This in turn could curtail the supply of 
bank credit.

mismatches. Inflation Is Projected to Remain      
Benign . . .  Despite pressures from rising food prices, with 
still large output gaps and high unemployment, 

average 2010 headline inflation is projected to fall 
from 8.5 percent in 2009 to about 6 percent in both 

2010 and 2011 (Table 5). Countries with fixed 

exchange rates are projected to have the lowest 

inflation rates, with the consumer price index (CPI) 

in Latvia projected to decline by 1½ percent in 2010 and rising by only 1 percent in 2011, reflecting the 
strong adjustment that has occurred in these 

countries. Inflation in the CIS countries is also 

declining sharply, to 7 percent in 2010. An exception 

is Turkey, where large excise increases, in 

combination with a strong recovery, are exerting 

upward pressure on prices. 
. . . While the Current Account Balance of the Region Is Near Zero   Current account deficits are projected to show 
little change in 2010 and 2011, following a 

substantial crisis-induced narrowing in 2009. For the 

emerging Europe region as a whole, a zero average 

current account balance is projected for 2010, 

unchanged from 2009 (Table 5). In the Baltics, 

current account surpluses are projected through the 

medium term, reflecting the very sharp 
improvement in its trade balance that has taken 
place.
12 One exception to this trend is Turkey, where 
a rapid rebound in domestic demand is leading to a 

wider current account deficit. 
_______ 
12 The internal devaluations that 
have taken place, and continue 
to take place, in the Baltic
s have brought about notable 
improvements in competitiveness. Wages in the Baltics rose 
between 60 and 100 percent from mid-2005 to mid-2008, far 

outpacing productivity growth. No
minal wage adjustment since, 
however, has been significant. In Latvia, unit labor costs (ULC) 
have come down 20 percent since the beginning of 2009, 

resulting in about a 14 percent 
depreciation of its ULC-based 
real effective exchange rate since its peak.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 30 
What Can Policymakers Do to 
Sustain the Recovery and 
Minimize Risks?  Resolute domestic policy responses to the 
crisisŠas well as large official financing packages 
from multilateral institutionsŠhelped prevent a 
cascade of bank and currency crises (see Chapter 3). 

Still, these policies themselves, and the deep 

economic downturns, have had some side effects 

that policymakers in the region will now have to deal 

with. The short-term policy challengesŠwhich are 

similar to those in advanced EuropeŠpresent 

difficult balancing acts, along the following 

dimensions: 
Reducing fiscal deficits to ensure sustainable public debt 
while minimizing the negative impact on growth.
 Several emerging European countries need to rein in 
large public sector deficits to secure debt 
sustainability and avoid negative market reactions 
as experienced earlier in 2010. The timing and 
pace of the consolidation will ultimately need to 

be tailored to individual country circumstances, 
and countries at high risk of market concerns 
about sovereign debt sustainability may need to 
proceed with fiscal consolidation at a faster rate.  
Repairing banking systems while reviving credit.
 The 
crisis has weakened the EE region™s financial sectors, with many countries experiencing sharp 
increases in NPLs. The dilemma facing banks is how to strengthen their balance sheets while 
reviving their lending operations. 
 Beyond the short term, most of the EE region 
will need to find new growth engines. In a number 
of countries, the growth model of the boom yearsŠ

driven by capital inflows, rapid credit growth, and 

domestic demand boomsŠwill need to shift toward 

a model more reliant on the tradable sector as an 

engine of growth. While this shift will in large part 
be the result of private sector decisions, government 
policies, in particular structural reforms and prudent 

wage policies, can also help. 
Restoring the Health of the Public FinancesPrior to the Crisis, Headline Fiscal Deficits 
Were Low in Most EE Countries . . . In 2007, emerging Europe as a group recorded a 
fiscal surplus of about 2 percent of GDP. Moreover, 

debt levelsŠat roughly 23 percent of GDP for EE 

countriesŠwere low compared with other emerging 

market economies, with the important exception of 
Hungary (Table 6). . . . But the Underlying Fiscal Position 
Worsened Due to Rapid Expenditure 
Growth However, these seemingly healthy fiscal balances 
were inflated by high temporary revenues related to 
domestic demand booms; the underlying fiscal 
positions had actually deteriorated as a result of 

rapidly growing expenditures (Figure 29). The rapid 

growth of expenditures during the boom years had 

set the stage for large deficits when revenues 

collapsed with the implosion of credit and domestic 

demand.The Deterioration of the Fiscal Position Became Visible in 2009, when Large Deficits Emerged . . .  As a result of the crisis, public sector deficits and 
debt levels shot up in 2009. EE countries™ average 
headline balance deteriorated from about zero in 
2008 to a deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2009, with 
a wide rangeŠfrom a low of 0.7 percent in Belarus 

to a high of nearly 9 percent in Lithuania (Table 6).
13Average public debt levels rose from about 

24 percent of GDP in 2008 to nearly 30 percent of 

GDP in 2009, again, with substantial intraregional 

variation. Those countries that had allowed their 

expenditures to grow more rapidly during the boom
_______ 
13 We focus on overall deficits sin
ce it is difficult to distinguish 
between cyclical and structural comp
onents of the fiscal balance 
in emerging market countries owing to uncertainty about potential output. This argument 
applies in normal times, but 
even more so during and following the crisis.

years tended to experience a larger fiscal 
deterioration. Thus, in hindsight, fiscal policy was 

too loose in most EE countries, reducing the scope 

for countercyclical fiscal policy during the crisis.14. . . And in 2010, when Deficits Remain 
High 
 Deficits remain high in 2010Šwith only a 
modest reductionŠwhile debt levels continue to 

rise (Table 6). EE countries™ average headline deficit 

is projected to fall to 5¼ percent of GDP in 2010, 
but there is considerable intraregional variation. 

While deficits in some countries, notably Bulgaria, 

but also in Belarus, Kosovo, Montenegro, and 

Serbia, are projected to widen significantly, in several 

others, particularly those facing binding financing 
constraints, large fiscal adjustments are taking place 
in 2010. In Latvia, the widening headline deficit 

masks substantial fiscal effort: Latvia is on track to 

take another 4 percent of GDP in fiscal 

consolidation measures in 2010, following measures 

of approximately 8 percent of GDP in 2009. 
_______ 
14 Hungary is a case in point. Deficits and debt levels were high 
going into the crisis; as the crisis erupted, Hungary was forced to procyclically reduce its deficit (Chapter 3). 
Substantial Fiscal Consolidation Is Needed over the Next Few Years  With deficits generally still at very high levels, and 
a permanent loss in revenues resulting from the end 
of the demand boom, it is clear that substantial fiscal 

consolidation is needed over the next few years to 

reduce vulnerabilities. Deficits and debt levels in EE 

countries are generally not as high as in euro area 

countries, but deficit levels are high by emerging 

market standards (Figure 30). Moreover, several 
countries in the region face difficult medium-term 
debt dynamics, reflecting an aging population,
15while medium-term growth prospects for most EE 

countries have worsened sign
ificantly after the crisis. 
Although Fiscal Consolidation May Hurt Growth in the Short Term, Market 

Concerns about Weak Public Finances 
Could Be Even More Damaging– 
 Even though fiscal consolidation is likely to be 
beneficial over the long term, fiscal retrenchments 

tend to have contractionary effects on output in the 
short term.
16 At the same time, recent events have 
shown how weak public finances can destabilize 

financial markets. Financial markets are increasingly 

focusing on fiscal vulnerabilities.
17 In emerging 
Europe, in the early stages of the crisis, investors 
were more focused on external imbalances and 
private sector credit growth and the nature of its 

funding, and sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) 

spreads were not associated with the level of fiscal 

vulnerability at that time (see the May 2009 
Regional Economic Outlook: Europe; IMF, 2009b). However, 
since the outbreak of sovereign debt concerns in 

western Europe in May 2010, this seems to have 

changed, with the level of sovereign CDS spreads

increasingly associated with the levels of fiscal 
vulnerability (see Figure 31). . . . Suggesting that Fiscal Consolidation 
Is Most Urgent in Countries with Weak 
Public Finances  To prevent the emergence of market concerns, 
countries with high fiscal vulnerabilities may need to 

proceed with fiscal consolidation at a faster rate. 

Indeed, EE countries faced with relatively high 

deficits are generally projected to make larger fiscal 

adjustments, and in Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine 

the consolidation is front-loaded (Figure 32). 

Countries with low debt and deficit levels, and hence 
low perceived risk of sovereign default, could delay 
fiscal consolidation, especially where recoveries are 

fragile. Expenditure-Based Consolidation Is 
Likely to Be Less Harmful for Growth 
 As discussed in Chapter 1, fiscal contractions that 
rely on spending cuts tend to have a less 

contractionary impact than tax-based adjustments.  
Current fiscal adjustment plans across the region are 
to a significant degree expe
nditure-based, although 
large adjustments, especially in the face of revenue 
erosion, would inevitably contain some tax-based 

components (Figure 33).  
Fiscal Consolidation Is Likely to Be More Successful if It Is Embedded in Medium-

Term Plans 
 The pace of fiscal adjustment in some countries is 
likely also driven by the trade-offs between speed of 

adjustment on the one hand and quality and 

durability of adjustment on the other. Some 

consolidation measures could have an immediate 

impact that quickly translates into improved market confidence, but these measures might not be 
sustainable and could possibly be harmful in the 

medium to long term. Other measures could involve 

more fiscally sustainable, ﬁhigh qualityﬂ adjustments, 

but their substantive effect on the budget deficit 

might not materialize until later years. Given this 

trade-off, it is all the more important to anchor fiscal 

policy in the context of a well laid out medium-term 

fiscal strategy. In that context, some countries are

monitoring and enforcement mechanisms 
(IMF, 2009a). Reviving Private Sector Credit Private Sector Credit Growth Has Been 
Weak since the Onset of the Crisis  The credit boom in many EE countries came to 
an abrupt end after the 
Lehman Brothers collapse 
and its aftermath (see also 
Chapter 3). Credit growth 
in 2009 was very low, and in many countries even 

turned negative. Private sector credit levels continue 

to decline in 2010 in the Baltics, and have remained 
flat at end-2009 levels in Bulgaria (see chart in Box 5). 
Initially, Weak Credit Was the Result of Supply Factors, in Particular the Decline 

in Capital Transfers from Western 
European Banks . . .  Credit growth stopped when banks in advanced 
countries, confronted with liquidity and capital 
shortages, advised their subsidiaries and branches in 

the EE region that new 
credit would henceforth 
need to be financed from an increase in local 

deposits. This effect was compounded by the 

freezing of the international syndicated loans market 

and the halt in the growth of direct cross-border 
loans.. . . And the Increase in NPLs . . .  As NPLs rose with the recession and exchange 

rate depreciations, the supply of credit was further 

affected by increases in banks™ provisioning needs. 

The increase in provisions was particularly high for 
countries with double-digit percentage drops in real 
GDP in 2009 (Figure 34), but even for countries 
with less severe recessions, such as Hungary, 

Moldova, and Russia, provisioning has more than 

doubled since 2007. The increase in provisioning led 

to a drop in retained earnings, further reducing the 

room for credit growth. Banks that had already built 

loan loss reserves (as a precaution against future 

NPLs) fared better. Indeed, higher loan loss reserves Bosnia & Herzegovina

in 2007 are associated with a lower drop in 
(nominal) credit growth in 2009 (Figure 35). Part of 

the reason is that there was less of a need for banks 

with higher reserves to fo
rm extra provisions during 
the crisis.  . . . But Demand Factors Have also 
Played a Role  Analysis of large banks shows that while supply-
side factors were very important in explaining loan 

growth in 2009, declining credit demand played a 

role as well (Box 5). In the first half of 2010, the 

effect of both supply and demand factors on private 

sector credit continued to be felt: bank deleveraging 
continues, increasing net credit to the public sector 
likely reflects some rebalancing of banks™ portfolios 

towards safer assets, and lending rates, particularly in 

those countries with weak cr
edit growth, continue to 
fall.The Revival of Credit Growth Would Help 
Support the Recovery  ﬁCreditlessﬂ recoveries in GDP growth are 
generally slow and shallow.19 It is therefore important that credit growth picks up to support 

financing to firms that cannot access funding from 

capital markets.Looking ahead, as the Economy 
Recovers, Supply Factors Are Likely to Be 
the Main Constraint on Credit Growth  As capital inflows are likely to remain weak, the 
funding of credit growth will have to rely more on 

domestic deposit growth, which could remain 

subdued due to the relatively high unemployment 

levels._______ 
19 Evidence from Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2008) shows 
that on average, the recession ends two quarters before the credit crunch ends and nine 
quarters before housing prices bottom out; equity prices tend
 to bottom out just as the 
associated recession ends. Such
 ﬁcreditlessﬂ recoveries are 
usually slow and shallow. 
 NPLs typically react with a considerable lag to 
changes in GDP. They continue to rise in most of 

emerging Europe (with the notable exception of 

Turkey), from levels that are already high (Table 7). 

The related provisioning for these new NPLs will 

further weigh on banks™ capital and their ability to 

lend. If sovereign debt con
cerns were to increase,

Box 5. Why Is Credit Growth WeakŠDemand or Supply? 
Why did credit growth slow down in 2009Šwas it lack of demand or lack of supply? And why did it remain weak 
in 2010? To disentangle demand and supply factors in 2009, a bank-level regression was run, using data on 63 big banks in 
the regionŠthe largest banks in each country 
accounting for assets comprising 60Œ90 percent 
of banking system assets in each country. The 
analysis suggests that in 2009 supply-side factors 
(in particular higher costs of funds and higher 
loan loss provisioning) were the most important 
factors holding back loan growth, although the 
contraction of GDP also played a role (first 
figure). The higher cost of funds is likely to have 
been the result of the drop in cross-border funds, 
as domestic deposit growth was still positive.  
Disentangling demand and supply factors in 2010 
is more difficult, as bank-by-bank data are not yet 
available. Weak demand is likely to have gained 
in importance, as lending rates, which had 
increased during the crisis, came down in a 
number of countries. On the supply side, 
aggregate banking system 
data show that bank 
deleveraging continued (second figure), 
especially in the Baltics and Bulgaria. Crowding 
out by the public sector could have played a 
role as well, as net credit to the public sector 
has increased in a number of countries, but it is 
difficult to disentangle potential crowding out 
effects from portfolio rebalancing toward safer 
assets. Evidence from Senior Loan Officers™ 
surveys (available for only a few countries) 
shows that banks are continuing to tighten standards in 2010:Q2 but significantly less so than in Q1, amidst rising 
demand for loans, particularly from firms. Higher capital and funding costs in Lithuania and a high 
nonperforming loans ratio in Romania are contributing to tighter lending standards for corporate loans.

securities (Figure 36) would need higher 
capitalizations to sustain large increases in sovereign 

risk premiums, and would need to rely less on 

sovereign bonds as liquid assets. Repair of Banks™ Balance Sheets Will 
Help Alleviate Supply Constraints. . . 
 A key precondition for credit growth to revive is 
the repair of bank balance sheets. The sooner banks 

recognize loan losses and raise additional capital, the 

sooner they will be able to regenerate loan growthŠ

and the sooner also will uncertainty about financial 

sector health be reduced. At the same time, current 
market conditions could make it more difficult to raise fresh capital. Moreover, there may be 

competition for funds, as many banks need to raise 

capital to meet the strengthened Basel 

requirements.20_______ 
20 At its September 12, 2010 meeting, the Group of Governors 
and Heads of Supervision, th
e oversight body of the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervisi

strengthening of existing capita
l requirements, to be phased in 
over several years. These capital reforms, together with the 
introduction of a global liquidity standard, will increase the 

minimum common equity requirement from 2 percent to

both capitalization and liquidity in banks. Credible 
macroeconomic policies would also make it possible 

to keep policy interest rates low, which would not 

only stimulate demand for credit but would also 

encourage bank funding through domestic sources 
and  support lending in local rather than foreign 
currency. 
Enhanced International Cooperation on 
Financial Sector Policies Would Help 

Further Reduce Uncertainty 
 Cross-border cooperation on the amount and 
duration of new financial sector levies would reduce 

speculation on regulatory arbitrage as is the case in Hungary (Box 6). Cross-border agreements on 

cooperation to prevent future crises could build on 

the example set by the recent Nordic-Baltic 

Cooperation Agreement. The latter not only 
provides clearly delineated rules for burden sharing 
but also establishes a permanent regional institution 

to discuss financial stability issues of regional 
interest. 
Shifting Growth Toward the Tradable 
SectorDuring the Boom Years, Growth in Many 
Countries in Emerging Europe Was 

Driven by the Nontradable Sector 
 During the boom years, a capital inflows-fueled 
domestic demand boom resulted in strong GDP 

growth, particularly in the nontradable sector, a 

growth pattern that contributed to rising current 

account deficits, increasing imbalances, and 
significant vulnerabilities (Figure 37 and Chapter 3).  
Growth Will Need to Shift to the Tradable Sector Capital inflows are unlikely to return to precrisis 
levels, and domestic demand is likely to remain 

depressed. Future growth must rely more on the 

tradable sector and less on the nontradable sectorŠ

especially in countries that had built up large 
imbalances during the boom.  
The Adjustment Will Need to Be Made by 
the Private Sector . . .  Restructuring should be helped by market signals 
that will change as profits in the nontradable sector 

shrink and investments seek more promising venues 

in the tradable sector. But the process may be 

difficult. Even in the tradable sector, new projects 

may have to compete for much scarcer financing. 

Inflows will remain subdued as banks in advanced 
Europe struggle to rebuild their balance sheets and 
risk-adjusted returns in emerging Europe seem less 

attractive. 
. . . But Public Policies Should Aim to 
Prevent a Repeat of the Overheating that 
Pulls Resources from the Tradable to the 
Nontradable Sector  Fiscal policy in particular could play a much more 
active roleŠsaving money when revenues are 

growing instead of increasing spending and boosting 
public wages. This may mean that during boom 
times small fiscal surpluses are not sufficientŠthat 

large surpluses are needed. Policymakers may prefer 

to spend in boom times, but the payoff from savings 

that a large fiscal buffer will reduce the need to cut

EMERGING EUROPE: TOWARD SELF-SUSTAINED GROWTH 39 
Box 6. Financial Sector Levies in Europe 
Across Europe, governments have been exploring ways to involve the financial sector in sharing the burden of 
the crisis, and in meeting the costs of future financial crises. Several EU countries have moved ahead with 
financial sector levies. In western Europe, Austria, Fran
ce, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have all 
taken steps in this direction (both actual and proposed). In emerging Europe, so far only Hungary has introduced 
a financial sector levy, while Poland and Croatia may be considering it in the near future. The approaches vary, 
but there are some common elements. In general, the tax is applied to some portion of liabilities, and applies to 
both banks and nonbank financial institutions. In some countries (Germany and Sweden), the proceeds from the 
tax flow (or are expected to flow) to an ex ante fund to finance future crises, while in others (Austria, France, 
Hungary, and the United Kingdom) they flow into gene
ral government revenue. Hungary™s financial sector levy 
stands out in terms of size (0.7 percent of GDP each year, more than three times higher than the largest tax 
among the other countries), and the lack of an exact timetable for scaling it back risks further deleveraging. 
A fully harmonized approach is still lacking, but international coordination is under way. The lack of a common 
approach reflects (i) the recognition that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work; and (ii) the lack of 
consensus (including in the public finance literature) on how taxation should address the distinct problems posed 
by the financial sector. Nevertheless, given the need to ensure a level playing field, some degree of international 
coordination has taken place at the G-20 and EU levels. The G-20, at its leaders™ June 2010 summit in Toronto, 
discussed an IMF staff report it had commissioned in 2009, and agreed that the financial sector should make a 
ﬁfair and substantial contributionﬂ toward paying for any burdens associated with government interventions to 
repair the banking system or fund resolution in a financial crisis.
1,2   
Looking ahead, further efforts at international coordination would be beneficial to promote a level playing field. 
Unilateral actions by governments risk being undermined by tax and regulatory arbitrage. Effective cooperation 
does not require full uniformity, but agreement on broad 
principles, including bases and minimum rates. Given 
their close integration with the rest of Europe, emerging European countries would be well advised to await the 
outcome of ongoing discussions at the EU levelŠwhich may, however, be protractedŠbefore implementing 
financial sector levies. 
Note: The main authors of this box are Christoph Duenwald and Jérôme Vandenbussche. 
1 IMF (2010a). The report proposes two forms of contribution from the financial sector: (i) a ﬁfinancial stability 
contributionﬂ (FSC), a levy to pay for the fiscal cost of any future government support to the sector; and (ii) any 
further contribution from the financial sector that is desired should be raised by a ﬁfinancial activities taxﬂ (FAT) 
levied on the sum of profits and remuneration of financial institutions. 
2 France, Italy, and the United Kingdom have also adopted taxes on bonuses in the financial sector. In early 2010, 
the U.S. government discussed the introduction of a ﬁfinancial crisis responsibility feeﬂ in the form of a 
0.15 percent tax on uninsured liabilities (defined as total assets net of tier I capital and insured deposits).

countries had to do during this crisis.Wage Restraint Is Essential . . .  Over time, wages will catch up with those in 
western Europe. But they cannot do so overnightŠ
wage increases need to go hand in hand with 
productivity increases. . . . But Emerging Europe Should Not 
Compete on Low Wages Alone 
 Although wages in EE are lower than in 
advanced Europe, other emerging markets have 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 40 
even lower wages. If it cannot compete on low 
wages alone, the region should instead aim to 

produce increasingly sophisticated products. 

Structural reforms could take advantage of the 

export-led recovery currently under way. This is the 
time to urgently undertake labor market reforms to 
address skill mismatches between workers in the 

nontradable sector looking for jobs and the jobs in 

the tradable sector waiting to be filled.
21Foreign Capital Inflows, Especially FDI, Can Also Play an Important Role, if They 
Are Aimed at Enhancing Supply, 
Especially in the External-Trade-Oriented 
Sector Such investment would support growth, transfer 
technology, and help contribute to an improvement 

of labor force skills. Recent research shows that for 

emerging Europe, increases in the share of FDI 

going to the tradable sector corresponds to an

increase in the export-to-GDP ratio (Kinoshita, 
forthcoming). Improvements in infrastructure and 

an educated labor force should help attract FDI to 

the tradable sector. 
Balanced Growth Is More Sustainable in the Long Run  In countries where growth during the boom was 
much more balanced, credit growth was more 
restrained, and current account deficits were small. 

They also experienced a less pronounced reversal in 

growth (Chapter 3). Countries that relied on 

domestic demand booms for growth, fed by rapid 

credit growth, were left without sufficient expansion 
of the economies™ supply potential. Indeed, the 
average growth over the cycle in these countries is 

no higher, and in some cases lower, than in 

countries with more restrained credit increases.

3. Emerging Europe and the Global Crisis: Lessons from the Boom and BustTwoyears after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, emerging 
Europe22 has begun its recovery from its deepest post-
transition recession. While the recovery remains uneven and 

export-led (Chapter 2), the banking and currency crises that 

many initially feared have largely been avoided. This chapter 

addresses three questions: Why was emerging Europe so severely affected by the global 
crisis? Why were the banking 
and currency crises that many 
had feared avoided? What lessons for crisis prevention can be drawn from the boom-bust 
cycle?How the Global Financial and Economic Crisis Affected Emerging EuropeŠA Narrative 
The Run-up to the Crisis  In the decade and a half prior to the global 
economic crisis, emerging Europe grew faster than 
almost all other emerging market regions. Per capita 
income in the region grew by 4 percent annually 

during 1995Œ2007Šexceeded only by China and 
India (Figure 38). Growth was helped by the 

transition from a planned to a market economy. Institutions were modernized, often in the context 

of an EU accession process. Foreign direct 

investment poured in to benefit from highly skilled 

labor. Great strides were made toward trade and 
financial integration with western Europe. 
Economic growth was further stimulated by the 
anticipation of rapid future income growth, 

declining real interest rates, and increasingly buoyant 

global economic and financial conditions. 
_______ 
Note: The main authors of this chapter are Yuko Kinoshita, 
Johan Mathisen, and Jérôme Vandenbussche. 
22 Two advanced countries (the 
Czech and Slovak Republics), 
which until 2009 were classified as emerging markets, have been included in this analysis as well,
 given the valuable lessons their experiences provide.  Until 2003, growth was driven largely by exports. 
Exports grew rapidly, as trade became integrated 

with the West. By 2007, the euro area had become 
the main trading partner of most countries in the 

region (Tables 8 and 9).23 Owing to their geographic 
proximity and relatively low labor costs, central and 
eastern Europe (CEE) countr
ies became part of an integrated cross-border production chain, with 

western European manufacturers shifting the 

production of components
 and intermediate goods 
to the east. German automakers were particularly 
active in outsourcing to CEE countries.
24 During this decade capital inflows remained moderate and 

went largely to the tradable sector.

23 Commodity exporters such as Russia and Ukraine trade with 
a broader set of countries. The Baltics trade mainly with Russia 
and their neighboring countries.

 predominantly commodity exporters.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 42 
` From 2003 onward, however, growth in the 
region was driven increasingly by a domestic 

demand boom (Figure 39). During 2003Œ08, 
domestic demand growth in the region averaged 

8 percent annuallyŠwell above GDP growth 
(6½ percent per year). Th
e boom was particularly 
pronounced in the Baltic and European CIS 

countries, together with Bulgaria, Montenegro, and 

Romania, where domestic demand grew by            

9Œ13 percent. In other countries (including Albania, 

Bosnia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Macedonia, 

Poland, the Slovak Republic), domestic demand 
growth was more moderate (4Œ6 percent per year). Domestic demand was weak only in Hungary, partly 
as the result of the substantial fiscal consolidation 
that took place in the precrisis years. 
 There was not only a boom in 
private
 sector demand; public expenditure grew rapidly as well. 

The boom in domestic demand and the increase in 

commodity prices (in commodity exporters such as Russia) led to a sharp increase in government 

revenues. Only part of this revenue surge was used 

to improve fiscal balances.
25 Over the five-year period, only Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Montenegro, and Turkey improved their fiscal balance by 3 percentage points of GDP or 

more. Instead, buoyant revenues were used mainly 

to increase public expenditure.
26 Real expenditure 
growth exceeded real GDP growth in every country, 

except in Macedonia. By 2008, only Belarus, 

Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Russia ran fiscal 

surpluses.27The demand boom was the result of a surge in bank 
credit and asset prices (Figures 40 and 41). Although

balance improved, primarily owing to rising oil prices.

EMERGING EUROPE AND THE GLOBAL CRISIS: LESSONS FROM THE BOOM AND BUST 
43 
much of the credit increase reflected the 
development of an initially undersized financial 

sector, the speed of credit growth exceeded what 
could be justified by appropriate financial deepening 

and jeopardized macroeconomic stability (WIIW, 

2010). Housing prices rose sharply (Figure 41), and 

even equity markets surged, with an average annual 

increase of some 40 percent. The domestic demand
 boom was fueled and 
financed by unprecedented capital inflows 

(Figure 42). Emerging Europe as a whole has been 

the beneficiary of large capital inflows since the late 

1990s. Initially, the region™s post-transition reforms, 
growth prospects, and integration with western 
Europe were the main factors that pulled foreign 

capital into the region. From 2003 onward, push 
factorsŠlow interest rates in advanced countries 
and low global volatilityŠfurther boosted capital 

inflows, as did the expectation of euro adoption and 

the dismantling of barriers to capital flows in the 
context of EU accession (Rosenberg and Tirpak, 

2008). Capital inflows became very large by historical standards and compared with other emerging market economies. The size and 

composition of the capital inflows varied 

significantly across countries, and some countries 

managed to avoid large capital inflows altogether (Figure 43). Capital inflows were particularly large in 

the Baltic countries and so
utheastern Europe (SEE), 
whereas the more mature economies of Poland and 

the Czech Republic with flexible exchange rates and 
small interest rate differentials to the euro received 
much more modest inflows.  Capital flows from western European banks were 
particularly important in fueling the demand boom.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 44 
Western European banks provided direct cross-border lending and financed much of the credit 

increase through deposits and capital injections to 
their local subsidiaries (Figure 44). With low margins 

in western Europe, western banks became 
increasingly interested in expanding in eastern 
Europe, and came to dominate much of the region™s 

banking systems as they acquired local banks that 
were privatized or put up for sale by their private 

owners. 
 The domestic demand boom
 contributed to rapid GDP growth but also led to a sharp increase of current account deficits, and an overheating of the 

economy. The current account deterioration was 

particularly pronounced in countries where domestic 

demand expanded by more than 8 percent per 

yearŠwith the exception of Russia, where terms-of- 

trade improvements to a large extent offset the 

impact of rising domestic demand.
28 With rapid growth, inflation started to pick up (Figure 45), 
labor markets tightened, and wage costs accelerated.

29 As more 
resources were drawn to 
the nontradable sector, 
growth became unbalanced. By 2007, the share of 

nontradable FDI was significantly higher in SEE 

and the Baltics than in CEE (Figure 46). The shift to 
the nontradable sector was not a problem in all 
countries: in CEE, where the share of 

manufacturing in FDI is high, the shift was largely 

avoided. By 2007, the growth pattern of many countries 
seemed unsustainable and vulnerable to a sudden 
decline in capital inflows. Growth had become 
reliant on domestic demand, supported by a 
continued rapid expansion of credit, large capital 

inflows, and continued asset price appreciation 

(Figure 47). As demand depended so much on credit 

growth that was financed from abroad, any slowdown or reversal of foreign financing was 

bound to hit the economy hard. Moreover, since the 

majority of loans were foreign currency 
denominated in much of the region, an exchange 
rate depreciation resulting from a slowdown of 

capital flows would have had powerful adverse 

balance sheet effects and could have undermined 
financial stability (Figure 48). Large external debt 

that had built up over years of substantial current 

account deficits meant that
 a decline of roll-over 
rates would have put debtors in a tight spot. Because 

much of the external debt was owed by banks, financial stability was potentially also at risk from 
this perspective.  
 Not all countries were equally affected by these 
imbalances and vulnerabilities, and some countries 

managed to avoid them altogether. These differences were in part the result of different policy 
reactions and institutions. 
Monetary and exchange rate policy:
 Countries with 
fixed exchange rate regimes and deep financial 

integration with western Europe had few 
instruments to stop the credit boom. Moreover, inflation in the wake of the credit boom drove 
real interest rates lower, further fueling the  
_______

demand boom. Countries with floating exchange 
rate regimes were able to tighten monetary 
conditions by letting the nominal exchange rate 
appreciate.

notable exception of Hungary, which began 
tackling long-standing fiscal weaknesses from 
2007. During the boom years, public finances were mostly improving, reflecting a strong 
revenue performance (Table 10). This was 
particularly pronounced in countries that relied 

heavily on domestic absorption.
30 By 2008, countries with the most rapid public expenditure 
growth were showing the most pronounced signs 
of overheating. In these 
countries, fiscal policy 
was procyclical in the sense that it further 

exacerbated private sector demand pressures. 
Financial sector policy:
 Many countries had taken 
prudential and supervisory measures in the form  
of tightening the existing regulations to stem 
credit growth but they had limited effects.
31 In Bulgaria, Croatia, and Serbia, administrative 
measures had been taken through direct credit 
controls or marginal reserve requirements on 
foreign borrowing. However, such efforts to slow 
down credit often diverted inflows into less 
supervised channels. For example, Bulgaria

Regional Economic Outlook: 
Europe(IMF, 2010g) on managing capital flows. 
introduced bank-by-bank credit ceilings in 2005Œ06, which seemingly reined in credit growth but 
also accelerated direct cross-border borrowing by 
firms. Also in Croatia corp
orate entities turned to 
direct borrowing from parent banks abroad instead of channeling loans through the domestic 

banking system where restrictions were high.  Despite these large variations in vulnerabilities, 
markets failed to differentiate between countries. 

Indeed, as vulnerabilities increased, risk premiums 
declined, and some of the countries with the highest 
vulnerabilities continued to enjoy investment grade 

status (IMF, 2010g). 
The First Stage of the Global Crisis  Between the start of the global crisis in August 

2007 and September 2008, GDP growth in 
emerging Europe remained generally strong. Despite 

the market turmoil in the United States and 

uncertainty in the global economy, capital continued 

to flow into emerging Europe and CDS and bond 

spreads in the region rose only moderately. Most 

equity markets lost steam from late summer 2007, 

but apparently without repercussions for real 
activities. Indeed, as inflation was rising rapidly, in 
part driven by booming food and fuel prices, 

controlling inflation became the main policy 

challenge. The focus of policymakers in the region 

remained to engineer a soft landing of their 

economies rather than preparing for an impending 

crisis. The Baltic countries were the first to experience a 
slowdown, albeit initially for reasons unrelated to 

the global turmoil.
32 Swedish banks had started to slow credit growth in the summer of 2007, as they 

became increasingly concerned about their exposure 

to the region.  
 Hungary experienced a short episode of financial 
stress in March 2008. It embarked on a fiscal 
consolidation program starting in mid-2006 to tackle 

long-standing twin deficits. The fiscal deficit and the

 current account deficit narrowed in 2007, and real 
GDP growth slowed from 4 percent in 2006 to 

1¼ percent in 2007. However, Hungary™s debt stock 

vulnerabilities were unsettlingly high. Government 

bond markets were briefly thrown into turmoil in 

the spring of 2008 when a government auction ran 

into trouble. The exchange rate depreciated by 
5 percent, and CDS rates shot up to almost 
200 basis points and remained elevated. The Collapse of Lehman Brothers and Its Aftermath 
 The global crisis spilled over to emerging Europe 
in September 2008, after Lehman Brothers filed for 
bankruptcy, through financial and trade channels. In 

a matter of weeks, global financial markets froze and 
international trade collapsed.  
 Risk aversion rose sharply, and equity markets 
plunged. Sovereign CDS spreads jumped by several 

hundred basis points in a matter of days in the Baltic 
countries, Hungary, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and 

Ukraine (Figure 49). The size of this increase was 

not indiscriminate but amplified pre-Lehman cross-

country differences. CDS and the Emerging Markets 
Bond Index (EMBI) spreads remained very high 
through the end of the first quarter of 2009 and then 

started a slow, gradual decline (Figure 50). Equity 

markets, which had corrected since the summer of 
2007 (or the fall of 2007 in the case of Russia and 

Turkey), suddenly plunged as both domestic and 
international investors re
treated and only bottomed 
out in February or March 2009 after falling by more 

than 60 percent (and up to 85 percent in Bulgaria)

As in the WEO, general government overall balances reflect staff™s projections of a plausible baseline, and as such contain a

   3
For Hungary, the general government overall balance projections include staff projections of the macro framework and of the imp
act 
of existing legislated measures, as well as fiscal policy plans as announced by end-August 2010. To meet the recently announced
commitments of the government to balances of 3.8 percent of GDP in 2010 and 3 percent of GDP in 2011, the authorities will need
 to 
approve additional measures.

In Latvia, the widening of the 2010 headline deficit reflects one-off bank restructuring costs of about 3.5 percent of GDP.
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 48 
 Some governments faced financing problems. 
Countries with relatively more developed financial 

markets (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Russia, 

and Turkey) witnessed a reversal of international 

portfolio flows, which in the case of Hungary 
translated into a drying up of the domestic bond 
market and looming financing problems for the 

government as early as October 2008. In addition, 
issuance of international sovereign bonds, which 
had already shown signs of weakness during the 

third quarter, came to a near-freeze during the 

fourth quarter when the total issuance volume for 

the region was only US$105 million (Table 11). This 
reflected both supply and demand factors because 
governments in the region, such as Poland™s, opted 

to stay away from the euro
 market hoping that the 
increase in spreads would only be temporary, and 

turned instead to the domestic market. 
 Banks experienced funding pressures. Many 
advanced-country banks, which were confronted 
with liquidity and capital shortages, sharply curtailed 

new lending or even deleveraged at the group level.

EMERGING EUROPE AND THE GLOBAL CRISIS: LESSONS FROM THE BOOM AND BUST 
49 
In a change of strategy, they advised their subsidiaries and branches in
 emerging Europe that 
new credit would henceforth need to be financed 
solely from an increase in local deposits.
33 This effect was compounded by the freezing of the 
international syndicated loans market (Table 12), as 
well as a halt in the growth of direct cross-border 

loans. As a reflection of these developments, the 

external positions of banks 
reporting to the Bank for 
International Settlements vis-à-vis countries in the 
region stagnated or started to decline (particularly in 

Estonia, Latvia, and Ukraine; see Table 13).  
 Banks™ funding pressures were further 
exacerbated by deposit withdrawals in October and 

November of 2008, in particular, in Montenegro, 

Russia, and Ukraine (Table 14). Foreign parent 

banks responded by providing liquidity support 

when and where necessary, but deposit rates started 

to creep up from that moment on. Nevertheless, a 

banking crisis could not be avoided in Latvia and 
Ukraine, where depositor confidence faltered and 
large domestic banks had to be taken over and 

recapitalized by the government (Box 7).  Net capital inflows dropped, sometimes very 
sharply (Figures 52 and 53). However, they  
remained positive in most countries, with the 
notable exception of Russia where large net capital 

outflows occurred. The highly indebted Russian corporate sector took advantage of the inflexible exchange rate framework to hedge its foreign 

currency exposure while Russian banks built up their 

net foreign assets. Foreign investors meanwhile 

reversed their carry trades when rapidly declining oil 

prices pointed to a likely exchange rate depreciation 

for the ruble.

 emerged they temporarily increased their

  Exchange rates generally came under pressure 
(Figure 54). In countries such as the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, 

and Ukraine, exchange rates fell sharply even while 

(some) central banks attempted to slow the pace of 

the depreciation. Most countries with a fixed 

exchange rate regime lost
 significant amounts of 
reserves. The evolution of an exchange rate pressure 
index based on monthly changes in nominal  
exchange rates and in international reserves suggests 
that pressures were broad-based in October 2008 

(Table 15). By the end of November pressures were 

greatest in Latvia and Ukraine, perhaps owing to the brewing banking crises in these countries. Early 
pressures in October on the Hungarian forint were 

relieved thanks to the prom
pt corrective actions of 
the government in the cont
ext of an IMF-supported 
program (see the next section), while Russia first 

engineered a controlled and very gradual 

depreciation of the ruble during the last quarter of 

2008, before letting the exchange rate go in the first 

quarter of 2009. But in the end, only Ukraine 
suffered from both an exchange rate and banking 

crisis.The Impact on the Real Economy The collapse in global trade soon led to a very 

sharp drop in exports. For large commodity 

exporters such as Russia (oil) and Ukraine (steel), the 

decline in export volumes was compounded by the 
sharp correction of commodity prices. 
 At the same time, domestic demand was affected 
by a sharp slowdown in credit growth and the

Box 7. Banking Problems in Emerging Europe during 2008Œ09 
In looking for instances of systemic banking crises in emerging Europe, we follow Laeven and Valencia™s (2010) 
definition. They define a banking crisis as a situation in which at least three types of significant public 
interventions were necessary to stabilize a banking system (see table). According to this methodology, only two 
countries in emerging Europe, Latvia and Ukraine, had a systemic banking crisis during 2008Œ09. Two other 
countries, Hungary and Russia, had some symptoms of 
a systemic banking crisis but they were of a lesser 
magnitude. LatviaŠLatvia™s banking sector was particularly vulnerable to a sudden stop in capital flows because of its high 
loan-to-deposit ratio and the overheating of the domestic economy long before the Lehman Brothers 
bankruptcy. From end-August to end-November 2008, systemwide banking deposits fell by 10 percent. Parex 
Bank, the largest domestic bank and second largest bank
 overall, faced the greatest problems, losing one-fourth 
of its deposits. On November 10, the Latvian authorities passed a Parex-specific package of measures consisting 
of a state guarantee covering certain existing and new loans, a one-year government deposit to support the bank™s 
immediate liquidity needs, and su
bordinated loans to strengthen its capital base. Initial responses to Parex Bank™s 
growing illiquidity failed to stem the deposit run. On December 1, the authorities also imposed a partial freeze 
limiting withdrawal amounts from large noncommercial private deposits, then on December 5, they completed 
the takeover of 85 percent of the shares. On December 23, the European Commission approved a Latvian 
support scheme providing guarantees to eligible banks to ensure their access to financing.  
An agreement was reached in March 2009 to reschedule Parex™s syndicated loans. The bank was then 
recapitalized in May 2009 by converting government deposits into equity and subordinated debt. Deposit 
outflows then stabilized. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) provided loans and 
acquired a 25 percent stake in September 2009. In October 2009, deposit withdrawal restrictions were partially 
lifted and the government made another injection into the bank in exchange for nonvoting shares. On August 1, 
2010, Parex was split into a good bank (Citadele) and a bad bank. There have not been any disruptions to date. 
The government also provided two capital injections into state-owned Mortgage and Land Bank in 2009.  
UkraineŠLarge banking sector risks were built up during the boom years as a result of the exceptionally rapid 
credit growth that brought the loan-to-deposit ratio to 140 percent. Major strains started showing in the banking 
system in the fall of 2008. After the sixth largest bank (Prominvest Bank) was put under receivership, a 
widespread deposit outflow began. The authorities responded by imposing limits on early withdrawal of time 
deposits, which slowed the outflow, but confidence remained very fragile.

EMERGING EUROPE AND THE GLOBAL CRISIS: LESSONS FROM THE BOOM AND BUST 
53 
Persistent concerns led to the outflow of over 20 percent of deposits between October 2008 and March 2009, 
which accelerated the capital flight and devaluation pressures, with severe repercussions on the FX-denominated 
loan books. In response, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) extended large-scale liquidity support to the 
banking system. A forward-looking diagnostic study of a nu
mber of large banks was performed during the fourth 
quarter of 2008 and revealed large capital deficiencies. Following completion of the study, shareholders of all the 
foreign-owned banks injected the necessary capital as did those of most of the domestically owned banks. 
However, for five of the domestically owned banks the shareholders were unable or unwilling to bring in 
additional capital and the banks (Ukrprombank, Nadra Bank, Ukrgasbank, Rodovid Bank, and Kyiv Bank) were 
put under administration. For three of them a resolution strategy was implemented, including recapitalization by 
the government and appointment of a new management team. Ukrprombank is currently being liquidated, while 
the resolution of Nadra Bank is still pending.  
Aggregate deposits stabilized in the spring of 2009, allowing the authorities to lift the ban on the early withdrawal 
of time deposits. A second diagnostic study for the smaller banks was completed in the spring of 2009. The 
shareholders of 27 banks undertook to provide additional capital by December 2009. As of the first quarter of 
2010, the NBU was in the process of finalizing resolution strategies for those banks that were unable to raise the 
necessary capital.  
HungaryŠHungary™s largest bank, OTP, is listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange, has a dispersed ownership 
structure and a significant 
presence throughout emerging Europe thro
ugh local subsidiaries. During the boom 
years, OTP had relied more and more on international borrowing at arm™s length. When the crisis hit the region, 
OTP thus was at risk of loss of both investor and depositor confidence. To support confidence, the government 
issued on October 22, 2008, a political commitment for a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits.  
As part of the IMF-supported program, the authorities then created in November 2008 a Capital Base 
Enhancement Fund, making available new capital to credit institutions in exchange for preferential shares. The 
scheme was open to all credit institutions of systemic importance on the market. It was extended twice and is 
now scheduled to expire on December 31, 2010. As of August 2010, only one credit institution, the mortgage 
lender FHB, had taken advantage of the recapitalization scheme. 
In addition, in March 2009, Hungary enacted a liquidity scheme aimed at providing foreign currency loans to 
Hungarian financial institutions to enable them to maintain lending to the real economy in spite of the severe 
domestic and international liquidity shortage. Three Hungarian banks without a foreign parent (OTP, FHB, and 
MFB, the state-owned development bank) benefited from the scheme.  
RussiaŠThe sudden change in exchange rate expectations tr
iggered by the collapse in oil prices in September 
2008 led Russian banks and firms to seek to hedge their foreign currency exposures, exacerbating pressure on the 
ruble. The banking system was put under additional pressure by deposit outflows and some bank failures early 
on. Several small banks (Kit Finance, Svyaz Bank, Globex Bank, and Sobinbank) had to be rescued by state-
owned banks or companies between mid-September and mid-October 2008. 
On October 20, the government announced that it would widen the remit of the Deposit Insurance Agency 
(DIA) by injecting budgetary funds and that these funds would be used to bail out medium-sized banks. Soon 
after, on October 29, VEFK Bank was put under temporary administration. In April 2009, it received an equity 
injection and a subordinated loan from the DIA. 
The authorities™ efforts to stabilize the banking system during the fourth quarter of 2008 were aimed at providing 
significant liquidity while keeping the exchange rate stable to offset the abrupt loss of foreign financing. Starting 
in October 2008, the government auctioned excess budgetary funds to banks, while the Central Bank of Russia 
(CBR) provided an ever-widening array of liquidity facilities, including uncollateralized loans. The CBR also  
–continued–REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 54 
Box 7. (concluded)
offered guarantees for interbank lending to qualifying banks, covering losses in the event that the license of a 
counterparty was withdrawn. In March 2009, another bank recapitalization scheme was announced which 
entailed an exchange of preferred shares for government bonds. With an improvement in overall bank liquidity, 
however, demand for this facility was relatively subdued, and it has been effectively shelved. 
By and large, the Russian authorities™ efforts proved successful in stabilizing their financial system. By late June 
2009, with renewed inflows, local liquidity conditions and interbank lending had improved, while the stock of 
uncollateralized loans provided by the CBR at the height of the crisis was being rapidly repaid ahead of schedule.
bursting of the real estate bubbles. The domestic 
demand decline was particularly pronounced in the 

Baltics and Ukraine, driven by a sharp fall in both 

consumption and investment. In the Czech Republic 

and Poland, which had been less affected by the 

credit-fueled domestic demand boom in the region, 

consumption remained stable or even marginally 

increased, thereby cushioning the overall domestic 
demand fall.  As a result, output in most countries declined 
very sharply (Figure 55). Seasonally adjusted GDP in 

Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine contracted by 
16 percent, 15 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, 
between September 2008 and March 2009. A few 

countries escaped severe recessionŠBelarus,

larger than in other EMC regions, mainly because

emerging Europe than elsewhere.

Policy Reactions  To contain the crisis, governments took a host of 
policy measures. Emergency 
measures were taken to 
support confidence in the banking sector. Rapid 

adjustments in monetary and fiscal policies were also 

implemented. In several cases, external funding was 

secured through IMF-supported programs and/or 

swaps and other arrangements with western 

European central banks. The policy mix depended 

on country-specific pressure points and constraints 
on policies. 
Stabilizing the financial sector was key 
 As in the United St
ates and western Europe, 
stabilizing the financial sectors was a priority. The 

financial sectors in emerging Europe benefited from 

measures taken by home 
country authorities in 
western Europe as well as both conventional and 
unconventional policy measures taken by the ECB 

and the Riksbank. Domestic policy measures also 

helped maintain the confidence of depositors and 
debt holders. These measures included loosening of 
reserve requirements, introduction of new domestic 

and foreign liquidity provision operations, debt 

guarantee schemes, as well as (almost universally) 
increases in deposit insurance coverage. Many 
supervisors strongly recommended a zero-dividend 

policy and sometimes requested preemptive 

recapitalizations based on stress tests (as in Romania 

and Ukraine). The author
ities also intervened 
directly in selected individual distressed institutions 
to provide them with fresh liquidity or capital (as in 

Latvia, Montenegro, Russia, and Ukraine). Foreign 

currency liquidity support was sometimes made 
possible thanks to swap arrangements with western 
European countries™ central banks, such as Estonia™s 

arrangement with the Swedish Riksbank, Latvia™s 

arrangement with Sweden and Denmark™s central 
banks, and Hungary™s and Poland™s arrangements with the Swiss National Bank. The ECB entered 
into repo agreements with
 the Hungarian National 
Bank in October 2008 and with the National Bank 
of Poland in November 2008.
35Monetary and fiscal policy reactions 
differed: some countries had to give 

priority to financial market 
stabilization, while others could provide stimulus  Adjustments in official policy interest rates 
depended on the strength of downward exchange 
rate pressures. Where fast exchange rate 
depreciations or devaluations would have threatened 

private sector balance shee
ts because of direct or 
indirect foreign exchange risk, policy rates were 

temporarily increased (as in Croatia, Hungary, 

Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine) or put on hold (as in 

Latvia and Romania) in sp
ite of the severity of the 
shock to the real economy. In other countries, 

policymakers were able to decrease policy rates 
(Czech Republic, Poland
, and Turkey). Monetary 
and exchange rate policy frameworks were 

maintained, with the exception of Belarus, Russia, 

and Ukraine.36_______

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 56 
 The immediate fiscal policy response depended 
on precrisis fiscal buffers, the exchange rate regime, 

and the position in the political cycle. Countries with 

an already fragile fiscal situation, such as Hungary, 
accelerated fiscal adjustment measures. For the 
Baltic countries, maintaining the credibility of their 
pegged exchange regimes required large-scale 

consolidation measures despite low public debt, and 

even fiscal reserves in the case of Estonia. By 

contrast, others were able to let automatic stabilizers 

work or even allow discret
ionary fiscal relaxation. 
Poland chose to only partially offset the effects of 
previously planned tax cuts in 2008 and 2009. Russia 

and Turkey adopted fiscal stimulus packages. 
Bulgaria drew on its fiscal buffers and postponed 
most of the adjustment until the summer of 2009 

when a new government took office. The Czech 

government put in place 
expansionary anticrisis 
measures in 2009, but quickly reversed course with 
the 2010 budget.International official financing provided 
relief  Several countries secured IMF-supported 
programs. Large, front-loaded financial assistance 

packages from the IMF, in close cooperation with 

the EU and other multilateral institutions, provided 

external funding and smoothed the required policy 

adjustments in several countries. The design of the 

underlying economic programs in each country 

reflected its circumstancesŠthe amount of fiscal 

space available and the nature of the exchange rate 
regimeŠand the preferences of its authorities (Box 8).37____________________________________________ 
pegged exchange rate regime; and Belarus devalued its currency 
by about 20 percent and repegged 
to a euro-dollar-Russian ruble 
basket (instead of the dollar) in early January 2009. 
37 Compared with previous crisis
 programs supported by the 
IMF, these programs differed in
 a number of key features: 
(i) financing was generally la
rger and more front-loaded, 
allowing countries to mainta
in supportive macroeconomic policies whenever possible; (ii) program conditionality was 

considerably streamlined, focusing more on measures 
addressing the vulnerabilities th
at magnified the impact of the 
shock; and (iii) top priority was given to financial sector 

stabilization, including guarantee schemes backed by IMF (continued)Why Was a Meltdown Avoided? 
 Although the crisis was deep, the large-scale 
regional banking and currency crisis that some had 

feared was avoided. In October 2008, market 

observers and analysts started worrying that western 

European parent banks would soon start to shrink 
their emerging European subsidiaries™ balance sheets or even walk away from their subsidiaries™ 
commitments, putting severe pressure on exchange 

rates and/or international reserves.
38 Investment banks and rating agencies worried that banking 

sector losses in emerging Europe would be so large 
that the soundness of several parent banks would be 

jeopardized.39 Despite these worries, there were no 
banking panics, and, unlike in many advanced 
economies, governments did not have to step in to 
save entire banking systems. Except for Ukraine, 

western European parent 
banks maintained their 
presence in emerging Europe despite a decline in 

profitability of their operations in the region. There 

was no collapse of any fixed exchange rate regimes 

eitherŠwhich is what had 
often happened in earlier crises in emerging economies. It was widely believed 

that if Latvia had broken its hard peg, contagion 
would have spread to other countries with a 
currency board. But in the end, Latvia managed to 

maintain its peg, although it suffered the largest 

recession in the region in doing so. 
Domestic Policy Actions Played a  
Role . . .  Much of the relative calm was due to decisive 
domestic policy implementation (see above). 

Concerns had been voiced in early 2009 that some 

of the new democracies in emerging Europe would

57 
Box 8. IMF-Supported Programs 
Several countries turned out to be particularly vulnerable from the beginning of the crisis and entered into an 
IMF-supported program in the fourth quarter of 2008.
1Hungary™s foreign exchange and government securities 
markets were particularly 
affected because of the 
country™s underlying stock vulnerabilities (public and external debt) and the high level of development and 
integration of these markets with the rest of the EU. In addition, the developed Hungarian FX swap market 
quickly froze. Hungary entered into an IMF program in November 2008.  
Substantial problems in Ukraine™s large steel sector
 (due to sharply lower external demand), growing 
concerns about the ability of its banks and firms to roll over existing international credit lines, and troubles at 
its sixth largest bank weakened confidence in the country™s banking system and currency. Ukraine entered 
into an IMF program in November 2008. In July 2010, a new Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved, 
with a cancellation of the old program.  
In Latvia, the availability of external finance fell very sharply, owing to global developments and downgrades 
to Latvia™s sovereign credit rating. The country™s largest domestic bank and second largest bank (Parex Bank) 
suffered a significant outflow of deposits after September 2008, compelling the Latvian authorities to 
partially nationalize the institution and provide liquidity support. Other domestic banks and firms found it 
increasingly difficult to roll over their international liabilities. Latvia entered into an IMF program in 
December 2008. 
Similar to other countries in the region, Serbia had an overheated economy. Its exchange rate came under 
pressure, households withdrew some of their deposits, and external financing became more difficult. The 
Serbian authorities decided to enter into a precautionary program with the IMF in January 2009. 
Prices for Belarus™s commodity exports fell, and demand for its products dropped off. Lingering effects of 
past booming domestic demand and the rapid appreciation of the U.S. dollar, to which it pegged its currency, 
put further pressure on the country™s trade balance. At the same time, Belarus faced much less accessible and 
more expensive credit markets. It first used its currency reserves as a temporary response, then started 
negotiating an IMF program in late October 2008. The program was officially approved in January 2009. 
One of the prior actions was a one-off devaluation by 20 percent of the Belarusian ruble. 
As economic conditions had worsened sharply, several other countries sought assistance from the IMF in the 
second quarter of 2009: 
Serbia augmented the size of its program in May 2009.  
In Romania, capital inflows had slowed sharply and 
international reserves had begun to decline. The 
Romanian authorities felt that the effects of the global crisis had not been especially pronounced in Romania 
compared with elsewhere in the region, but that the vulnerability to a sudden drop in capital flows was higher
due to the weak fiscal position and high current account deficit. They entered into an IMF program in May 
2009.–continued–Note: The main author of this box is Jérôme Vandenbussche. 
1As discussed in the main text, many of these programs were also supported by other international institutions 
such as the European Union. See also Table 16.

Box 8. (concluded)  
Notwithstanding its favorable fundamentals and the authorities™ strong policy response, Poland™s economy 
was being severely affected by the global financial crisis through both the export and financial sector 
channels. Poland had maintained access to internationa
l capital markets but with foreign direct investment 
(FDI) coverage of the current account deficit declining rapidly and continued portfolio outflows, the zloty 
had come under significant pressure and depreciated by
 about 35 percent against the euro in the fourth 
quarter of 2008. Poland received a Flexible Credit Line from the IMF in May 2009. 
In Bosnia, the rapidly deteriorating external and fi
nancial environment created substantial external and 
budget financing needs, thus necessitating a rapid adjustment. Agreement on an IMF program was reached 
in May 2009 (the program was officially approved in July). 
In Moldova, falling demand in trading partners led to a severe downturn in exports and remittances. 
Domestic demand collapsed, causing GDP contraction and deflationary pressures. External and budget 
financing shortfalls due to a decline in capital inflows and structural fiscal deterioration necessitated a large 
adjustment. Arrangements under the Extended Credit Facility and the Extended Fund Facility were 
approved in January 2010.  
Kosovo™s economic performance has been hampered 
severely by infrastructure bottlenecks, and rapid 
expenditure has undermined fiscal sustainability. The IMF program for Kosovo was approved in July 2010 
to help restore fiscal sustainability and safeguard financial stability.

Ł Tighten the fiscal stance in 2009Œ10: limit the 2009 
general government deficit to 1¾ percent of GDP and 
adopt further fiscal consolidation in 2010. The tightening 
involves strict income policies for containing public sector

space to expand infrastructure investment. 
Ł Strengthen the inflation-targeting framework while 
maintaining a managed floating exchange rate regime. 
Since the program was designed, Serbia™s 
external and financial environment has 
deteriorated substantially. In response, the 
authorities have (1) raised fiscal deficit targets 
for 2009Œ10 while taking additional fiscal 
measures, (2) received commitments from main 
foreign parent banks that they would roll over 
their commitments to Serbia and keep their 
subsidiaries capitalized, and (3) requested 
additional financial support from international

hopes of convergence. In reality, political 
institutions proved much stronger than feared, 

thanks in part to EU me
mbership or prospects of EU accession. The resilience was remarkable, 
especially in the fixed exchange rate countries. 
. . . As Did International Support Large-scale and timely international financial 

support was also crucial in supporting market 

confidence and avoiding sharp currency depreciations (Table 16). The global financial crisis 
in emerging Europe reshaped the role played by 

international financial institutions (IFIs) in crisis 

prevention and resolution. The IMFŠfor EU 

members jointly with the EUŠacted quickly to 

extend large front-loaded loans to the affected countries. This was made possible partly by reforms 

to the IMF™s lending framework undertaken at the onset of the global financial crisis.
40 Early involvement of the IMF before the collapse of currencies reduced tail risks and helped bring down 

borrowing costs for emerging markets that had 

spiked following the bankruptcy of Lehman 

Brothers. The EU enhanced access to its structural 

funds as part of the European Economic Recovery 

Plan of December 2009, concluded parallel 
programs with EU member countries, which 

substantially increased overall financing, and 
extended its support to nonmember countries with 
fiscal support and broad support for banks and 

small and medium-sized enterprises. The World 
Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 

Development (EBRD), and the European 

Investment Bank (EIB) also stepped up their 

support to the affected countries in bank 

restructuring. In some cases, bilateral financial 

support was provided by other European countries.41_______ 
40 The IMF increased its resources for loans from about $250 billion to $750 billion, 
following the April 2009 G-20 
summit in London. The IMF also
 conducted a major overhaul 
of its lending framework by offering higher loan amounts and 

further tailoring loan terms to countries™ circumstances. 
41 The Nordic countries, the Czech Republic, Estonia, and 
Poland provided financial support to Latvia. 
The Western European Banks™ Presence 
Contributed to Financial Stability during the Crisis  Although western European banks played a 
major role in providing the capital flows to emerging 
Europe, they also helped stabilize the region during 
the crisis (Figure 56).
42 Outflows were more contained in countries with higher penetration of 

foreign banks, and some countries even experienced

inflows. Contrary to the sk
eptics™ early concerns, all foreign banks remained in the region, which had a 

stabilizing effect.
43 Although western banks generally stopped 

providing new financing to their subsidiaries, they 

broadly maintained their exposure and provided 

fresh equity when necessary or required by local 

supervisors, as in Romania and Ukraine.44 Early in 
the crisis it became clear that all large foreign 
banking institutions operating in the region would 

benefit from explicit and implicit guarantees from 
their home country governments and would not be 
allowed to fail. This strong backing by western 

sovereigns certainly supported depositor confidence 

across the region and was instrumental in preventing 

panics.   The continuation of bank exposure was helped 
by the informal forum called the European Bank Coordination Initiative (EBCI, also known as the 
ﬁVienna Initiativeﬂ), through which foreign parent 

banks pledged to maintain exposure to countries 

with an IMF program during the crisis (Box 9). It 

was recognized that under the prevailing 

circumstances, western banks faced a coordination 

problem: while they had an interest in staying in the 

region, they would be better off exiting first lest 
competitors decide to leave before they do. Agreements in the context of the EBCI helped 
resolve the collective action dilemma and proved to 

be instrumental in restoring confidence among 

banks operating in the region. 
Banking Sectors Had Considerable Buffers Many banking sectors in the region had sizable 
buffers before the crisis. As shown in Table 7 (see 
page 37), capital adequacy ratios were generally well 

above 10 at end-2007 and end-2008, and 
profitability remained positive in 2009, except in the 

Baltics, Montenegro, and Ukraine. The absence of

44 OTP (Hungary) also supported 
its subsidiaries during the 
crisis by extending capital transfers. exchange rate crises, which protected borrowers™ 
balance sheets and gave banks time to renegotiate 

the terms of some loans (f
or example, by extending 
their maturity) so as to avoid default, goes a long 

way to explain the relatively moderate deterioration 
of credit quality in most countries in spite of large 
GDP declines.
45Countercyclical Policy in Western Europe Helped   Western Europe™s counte
rcyclical monetary and 
fiscal policies also cushioned the impact of the 
shocks. Rapid cuts in policy interest rates and 

abundant liquidity provision to western European 
banks by the ECB and the Riksbank limited the increase in emerging European banks™ funding costs 

in foreign currency despite the increase in CDS 

spreads across the region. They also lowered the 

debt service burden of floating-rate mortgages 

denominated in foreign currency. Moreover, with 

interest rates in the West hitting rock bottom, even moderate interest rate levels in emerging Europe 

helped support currencies. As a result, except for 
Latvia and Ukraine, the increase in average deposit 
rates remained moderate throughout the crisis (Figure 57). In addition, very accommodative fiscal 

policy in western Europe produced positive 

spillovers to emerging Europe as it put a brake on 

the decline in exports, especially for those countries 

with a well-developed automobile sector that 

indirectly benefited from various cash-for-clunkers 
schemes in the West. Imbalances Were of a Self-Correcting

correcting natureŠa drop in capital inflows led to a 
_______ 
45 Stress tests prepared by market analysts in 2008:Q4 or 2009:Q1 often assumed that nonperforming loans would 
quickly reach 25 percent in all countries, leading to strong 

recapitalization needs. In fact, NPL ratios at end-2009 were 
generally well below that level, 
except for Ukraine (though the 
higher levels in part reflect
 a broader defi
nition of NPLs).
EMERGING EUROPE AND THE GLOBAL CRISIS: LESSONS FROM THE BOOM AND BUST 
63 
Box 9. European Bank Coordination Initiative (ﬁVienna Initiativeﬂ) 
In late 2008 the global financial crisis spread to eastern Europe. Western banks with subsidiaries in central and 
eastern Europe (CEE) and southeastern Europe (SEE) coun
tries faced an exceptional degr
ee of uncertainty, and a 
serious coordination problem. Given countries™ large share of foreign private debt, any bank recognized that if 
other banks left, only an early exit would ensure availability of funds to repatriate the investment. In the absence 
of a coordination mechanism, uncertainty could therefore have led to wholesale retreat of foreign banks, 
notwithstanding their declared interest in staying. 
Being concerned about the possible fallout from uncoordinated withdrawal of foreign banks from CEE/SEE 
countries, the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the European Union 
(EU) established as early as in January 2009 an informal forum called the European Bank Coordination Initiative 
(EBCI, also known as the Vienna Initiative). The purpose of the group was to foster a dialogue between all key 
stakeholders, including foreign banks, home and host supervisors, and relevant governments, and thereby reduce 
the likelihood of uncoordinated outcomes.  
The EBCI became a truly effective and operational tool in the context of IMF- and IMF/EU-supported programs 
in CEE and SEE countries. Given that CEE and SEE™s balance of payments problems were the result largely of 
private sector debtŠgenerally capital inflows from parent to subsidiary banksŠthe international lenders sought 
assurances that the private sector would share the 
adjustment burden. The EBCI provided the necessary 
framework for such private sector involvement (PSI). In country-specific meetings for a range of program 
countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, and Serbia), foreign banks active in the country 
publicly declared support for economic adjustment by maintaining exposure at predefined levels and, in most 
countries, recapitalizing their subsidiaries on the basis of stress tests.
1 ﬁQuid pro quoﬂ macroeconomic programs 
increased international reserves and served as policy commitments by the authorities to ensure a predictable 
operating environment. Banks™ commitments were made fo
r limited time periods and renewedŠgenerally at the 
time of formal reviews of the lending programs. 
The EBCI has been a successful vehicle for publicŒprivate sector coordination and helped avert a systemic 
financial crisis in the region. Follow-up meetings conducted on a regular basis found that commitments made in 
the country meetings were broadly honored and that both banks and the public sector felt that the dialogue had 
supported a more predictable economic environment and helped economic stabilization and recovery in 
individual countries. With the acute phase of the crisis now resolved, the role of the EBCI is increasingly shifting 
toward forward-looking policies for the region. Among a range of topics, key concerns include setting an 
appropriate prudential environment supporting renewed but balanced credit growth in the region and developing 
adequate policies to reduce risks from the very high level of foreign currency borrowing.

reduction of current accoun
t deficits rather than a depletion of reserves. During the boom years, 

capital inflows had boosted domestic demand and 
contributed to widening current account deficits. 
When the capital inflows declined, domestic demand 

and current account deficits adjusted, and reserve 

declines remained fairly moderate, even in countries 

with fixed exchange rates. Thus, the Baltics and 
Bulgaria did not experience a currency crisis, 

although their current account adjustment exceeded 

that of the Asian crisis countries (Figure 58). The 

SEE countries also experienced a sharp adjustment of their current account deficits, although not as 
severe as in the Baltics and Bulgaria. The exceptions 

were Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine, which 

experienced large capital outflows, and used a 

significant amount of their 
reserves to defend their exchange rates before they were allowed to 

depreciate. 
Lessons for Crisis Prevention  Although the crisis in emerging Europe was 

triggered by external factors (the recession in western 
Europe and the sudden stop in capital inflows), domestic imbalances and vulnerabilities played a key 
role. Indeed, it is striking how large the differences 
have been in the extent to which countries have 
been affected by the crisis: the Baltic states and 
Ukraine saw very large declines in GDP (IMF, 

2010i), whereas others such as Albania, Belarus, and 

Poland had (if at all) short and shallow recessions. 
Countries that have largely managed to avoid the capital inflows-driven credit and domestic demand 

booms have had a much less severe recession 

(Box 10).  Thus, one of the main lessons of the crisis is that 
GDP growth that is driven by credit booms, rapid 
domestic demand growth, and large capital inflows 
into the nontradable sector is ultimately not 

sustainable. Bakker and Gulde (2010a and 2010b) 

and EBRD (2009) find that the size of the precrisis 

credit boom explains the depth of recessions better 

than any other variable.46 Countries with very rapid 
credit growth not only ex
perienced higher output 
volatility with strong growth followed by deep 
recessions but over a longer time period they do not seem to have experienced higher 
average 
growth, as the higher output losses during the recession offset 
the higher growth during the boom years 
(Figure 59).  How can countries avoid capital inflows-driven 
credit and domestic demand booms? What is the difference between countries that largely managed to 
avoid the buildup of imbalances and those that did 

not? One of the main lessons is that prudential 

measures to control credit growth would likely be 
more successful if they relied on better cooperation 
between home and host supervisors. This is 

particularly relevant for fixed exchange rate countries, as credit booms can be difficult to stop 

with conventional moneta
ry policy instruments in 
these circumstances. Other policy instruments, such 
as fiscal policies, would have to play a more active 

role. During boom years, rapid revenue growth 

should be used to build up fiscal buffers rather than  
_______ 
46 Other variables that help expl
ain the depth of recessions are 
short-term external debt and tr
ading partner growth (Blanchard, 
Das, and Faruqee, 2010). IMF (2010e) identifies external 
vulnerabilities more generally, trading partner growth and foreign bank claims, along with credit growth.

Precrisis  
Crisis
Recovery 
Realactivity  
Emerging Europe experienced significantly stronger 
precrisis GDP growth than past crises countries.
The recession in emerging Europe was much deeper than past 
crises. Although economic activity has contracted at the same 
rate, the duration has been longer. The recessions in both Latvia 
and Ukraine have been deeper than Uruguay™s recessionŠthe 
deepest recent recession before this crisis. 
In previous crises, the recovery was ﬁV-shapedﬂ and 
output losses were fully recovered after 10 quarters. Is 
seems likely that the bottom of this crisis will be flatter 
than in previous crises, and the recovery is projected to 
be longer. 
Credit 
growth 
Credit growth in emerging Europe was much higher 
than prior to previous crises. 
Given the strong precrisis credit growth, year-over-year real credit 
growth in emerging Europe turned negative only after five 
quarters. In contrast, year-over-year credit growth in past crises 
quickly turned negative, but bottomed out after 6 quarters at a 20 
percent fall in credit. 
In previous crises, the overall credit recovery took 10 
quarters, although several countries experienced an 
extended period of contraction of credit. 
Capital 
flows 
Capital inflows were much higher in emerging 
Europe than in previous crises. The inflows 
increased sharply just before this crisis, while inflows 
had fallen steadily ahead of previous crises. 
The collapse in capital inflows to emerging Europe has been 
spectacular. However, net inflows to emerging Europe remained 
positive until the recession bottomed out. Part of the reason for 
this is that FDI inflows held up relatively well.  
In previous crises, the capital outflows typically lasted 
several quarters and remained below precrisis levels.

facilitating a surge in expenditure, and at times large 
surpluses may be appropriate. 
Prudential Measures Require Better Home-Host Cooperation  A key lesson from the crisis is that controlling 
credit growth through prudential measures is 
challenging. Indeed, the effectiveness of the flurry of 
domestic prudential measures to stem overall credit 

growth has been mixed (IMF, 2010g, and Enoch 

and Ötker-Robe, 2007).   Externally funded credit growth has proven 
particularly hard to control. Many western banks in 

emerging Europe operate their foreign affiliates as if 
they are branches,47 with risk management centralized at the group level and local supervisors 

relying on parent bank™s home supervisors to 

monitor the changes in th
e risk profile of their 
foreign affiliates. Foreign-owned banks can often 

evade regulatory measures, including by switching 
from domestic to cross-border lending, or by 

switching lending from banks to nonbanks, such as 

leasing institutions (owned by foreign-owned banks). 
They are also less likely to be influenced by domestic 
monetary policy measures, such as raising of 
_______ 
47 Legally, most of the foreign affiliates were subsidiaries. 
domestic interest rates. Often, these banks are 

systemically important in 
the host country, although a small part of the overall bank group.  
 Better cooperation between home and host 
supervisors would likely make prudential measures 

to control credit growth more successful. Such cooperation should include adequate mechanisms 
for effective communication, information sharing, 

and joint analysis of common concern, and the 

formulation of effective responses (Fonteyne and 

Mathisen, forthcoming). The recent advances in 
integrating national frameworks within the EU will 
help address the challenge of containing buildup of 

financial risks, particularly challenging in countries 

with an extensive foreign bank presence.
48 One prudential measure that could have usefully 

been used more is the discouragement of foreign 
currency loans. Some countries were partially able to 
discourage foreign currency 
lending in the run-up to 
the crisis. For example, Belarus, Moldova, and 

Turkey effectively restricted household borrowing in 

foreign currencies through long-standing prudential 

regulations, while Poland relied on guidelines to 

stem such practices. A more widespread effective 

discouragement of foreign currency loans would 
have slowed credit growth in many countries, as 
much of the credit boom was financed by foreign 
banks, which were not allowed to take an open currency position. It would also have prevented the 

buildup of large currency mismatches in the private 

sector, which posed a severe risk during the crisis 

(see Figure 60 and Box 11).
49_______ 
48 The recent financial reforms and how they related to New 
Member States are described in Box 7 in IMF, 2010g. 49 Measures to contain foreign 
exchange risks can be imposed 
directly on banks or indirect
ly on the borrower (Enoch and 
Ötker-Robe, 2007). Turkey™s ban on foreign currency loans to 
households and the European Co
mmission™s proposed lowering 
of loan-to-value ratios are examples of direct measures. Such 
measures could also include tightening or introducing sectoral 
limits on banks™ net open foreig
n currency position or imposing 
a limit on banks™ gross foreign exposure (EBRD, 
Transition Report, 2009, p. 74). Examples of indirect measures include 
Hungary and Poland™s requirement
s for banks to disclose the 
risks of foreign currency borrowing to potential clients. They 
can also take the form of consumer protection, for example, by

EU. 
Fixed Exchange Rates Make Credit 
Booms Harder to Stop It is striking that the strongest credit growth 
during the boom years took
 place in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes (Figure 61). While the 

Baltics, Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Ukraine all had 

annual credit growth at 
about 10 percent of GDP or 
more, many of the countries in the region with more flexible exchange rate regimes largely managed to 

avoid a credit boom. The 
countries with floating 
exchange rates during this period (Albania, Poland, 
and Turkey) had the lowes
t outstanding credit-to-GDP ratio at the end of 2008, as well as the lowest 

precrisis credit growth.  
 This difference exists in part because countries 
with fixed exchange rates have a limited set of monetary policy tools to restrain credit booms once 
they set in, as discussed above. Countries with 

flexible exchange rates, on the other hand, can 

dampen booms by letting the nominal exchange rate appreciate. Such an appreciation helps prevent 

overheating of the economy and further lowers 

inflation by reducing import prices, which keeps real 

interest rates higher. It is 
noticeable that many of the countries that avoided a credit boom (Czech 
Republic, Poland, and Slovak Republic) saw a 
substantial appreciation of their nominal exchange 

rates during the boom years.  
 Yet, there were also some countries with fixed 
exchange rate regimes that did not experience 

massive credit booms (Bosnia and Macedonia). 
Indeed, in non-EU SEE there seems little difference 
between countries with fixed exchange rates and those with more flexible 
exchange rates. Capital inflows in these countries were much lower, partly 

because of the memory and legacy of various 

conflicts in the region, and partly because they were 

not (yet) in the EU. This suggests that, in the 

absence of large capital inflows, fixed exchange rates 
do not necessarily pose a problem. More generally, 
the recent IMF study on exchange rate regimes that 
looks at all countries in the world has concluded that

Box 11. Foreign Currency Mortgages, Maturity Mismatches, and Foreign Currency 
Shortages: The Cases of Hungary and Poland 
Foreign currency (FX) mortgage loans, mainly in Swiss francs, became very popular in Hungary and Poland in 
the years before the crisis. These loans were attractive fo
r borrowers because they carried lower interest rates than 
domestic currency loans; they were profitable for banks be
cause of extra revenues related to foreign exchange 
rate operations and high commissions. Of course, FX mortgage loans were only cheaper if the exchange rate 
remained stable, or appreciatedŠan expectation that was widely held at the time. 
Swap markets played an important role in the funding of these loans. While subsidiaries of western European 
banks could obtain the foreign currency resources for these loans from their parent banks, domestic banks 
financed these loans in part through swapping domest
ic currency deposits into foreign currency resources. 
During tranquil times, these swap markets worked well, as sufficient liquidity was provided by foreign banks. 
Western banks originated FX swap contracts and closed their own open position in the Hungarian forint or 
Polish zloty through Treasury bond repo operations.  
During the financial crisis, this funding mechanism broke down. As the cost of foreign currency funding from 
western parent banks went up, banks increasingly tried to obtain foreign currency through swapping domestic 
currency. Yet just when 
demand
 for FX swaps increased, 
supply
 of FX swaps was reduced, as the counterparties in 
FX swap transactions attempted to reduce their exposure to central and eastern European economies. Medium-
term FX swaps became practically unavailable, while 
short-term swapsŠthe instrument of last resortŠbecame 
very costly for domestic banks. Moreover, with the forint and the zloty depreciating, rolling over swaps required a 
growing amount of domestic currency resources. This 
process caused severe liquidity strains in some domestic 
banks, which triggered a ﬁdeposit warﬂ in the Hungarian and Polish banking sectors, which fueled a general rise 
in deposit interest rates in late 2008 and 2009. 
Rapidly evaporating FX liquidity on the interbank market forced the National Bank of Poland to provide short-
term (7 days) FX swaps. In Hungary, the central bank also introduced short-term FX swaps as a stop-gap 
measure, and began offering longer-term FX swaps (3 and 6 months) in March 2009. Both facilities are still in 
operation, although conditions in the FX swap market have normalized.   
The Hungarian and Polish experiences exemplify the risk for banking sector stability created by the expansion of 
mortgages denominated in foreign currency and financed by domestic currency deposits combined with swap 
transactions. To help contain this risk, prudential regulation should be enhanced to strengthen the management 
of on-balance-sheet FX liquidity mismatches.

economies with pegged regimes generally fared 
neither better nor worse than those with floats 

during the global financial crisis (IMF, 2010h, 
Box 1.1).  
 Fixed exchange rates do not necessarily result in 
credit booms, but they do make it hard to prevent 
credit booms in the presence of large capital inflows. 

Some countries with fixed 
exchange rates attracted particularly large capital inflows because they had 

just entered or were about to enter the EU, and 
were seen as plausible cand
idates to enter the EMU. 
This further lowered the perceived exchange rate 

risk, increased overall expected growth and 

investment returns, and thereby contributed to 

excessive foreign-financed credit growth (Figure 62). 
Larger Fiscal Surpluses during Boom Times? The limits of prudential policies and the role of 
exchange rate regimes underscore the need for a  
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 70 
decisive fiscal response to capital inflows. In 
particular, fiscal policy can look very good during 

boom yearsŠwhen domestic demand booms feed 

fiscal revenues. This often creates the illusion of 
fiscal space, at a time when
 fiscal policy may need to play a much stronger countercyclical role, especially 

in countries with fixed exchange rates. 
 The rate of precrisis public expenditure growth in 
many countries now ap
pears to have been imprudent. The large increases further fueled 

overheating; it also set the stage for large deficits 

when part of the revenue surge turned out to be  
temporary (Figure 63). Indeed
, countries that better 
managed their fiscal positions fared better during the 

crisis. These countries had generally higher foreign 

reserves as well as larger fiscal buffers. Many of the 

other countries had to seek external assistance 
because of fiscal financing problems once the crisis 

erupted. Fiscal policy could play a much more active 
roleŠsaving money when revenues are growing 

instead of increasing spending and boosting public 

wages. This may mean that
 during boom times small 
fiscal surpluses are not sufficientŠthat large 
surpluses are needed. This might prove a daunting 

task, and would require a strong political will to 
adhere to the overall objective of medium- and long-
term fiscal sustainability (Figure 64). Policymakers 

may prefer to spend in boom times, but the payoff 

from saving is that a large fiscal buffer will reduce 

the more politically damaging need to cut 

expenditure sharply during a recessionŠas several 

countries had to do during this crisis. Conclusion The crisis in emerging Europe provides 

important lessons in crisis prevention. Although the 
crisis was triggered by external factors (the recession 
in western Europe and the sudden stop in capital

inflows), domestic imbalances and vulnerabilities 
played a key role. Indeed, countries that managed to 
avoid the capital inflows-driven credit and domestic 

demand booms have had much less severe 

recessions, and are now in much better shape as a 
consequence. 
 If crises of the type we have just witnessed in 
emerging Europe are to be prevented in the future, 

these lessons from the past must be learned. Most 

importantly, prudential policies will need to be 

strengthened, including through improved 
international cooperation 
and greater attention by 
home supervisors to activities of their banks in 

emerging Europe. Macroeconomic policies, in 

particular fiscal policies, will have to play a more 

active role to counter capi
tal inflows-driven credit 
and domestic demand booms.   Finally, policies aimed at slowing credit booms 
should have long-term benefits in promoting more 

balanced and sustainable growth. Countries that 

experienced the most severe credit boom also saw 
the largest output volatility and the most 
pronounced output reversals. It now appears that 

average GDP growth over the cycle in this group 

was no higher and in some cases lower than in 

countries with more restrained credit increases. In 
addition, growth among the countries with the 
highest credit growth wa
s often very imbalanced, 
resulting in an insufficient expansion of their 

economic supply potential. Finally, countries with 

the most rapid credit growth have also ended up 

with the highest external debt and the largest fiscal deficits. Above all, it will be importantŠwhen the next 
boom comesŠto be wary of stories that ﬁthis time 

is different.ﬂ Such narratives often have some 

plausibility and attractiveness during booms, 

especially when they become prolonged and 

warnings from skeptics increasingly fall by the 
wayside. But a careful analysis of the drivers of 

growth, asset price developments, and 
competitiveness should always be used as a reality check. 72
