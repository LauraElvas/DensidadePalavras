   February 2010Fragile recovery in progress in the EU The EU economy is gradually recovering, whilst still facing headwinds. Real GDP started to grow again in the 
third quarter of 2009, ending the longest and deepest recession in the EU's history. As projected in the autumn, 

growth eased in the fourth quarter as the impact of temporary factors, such as the car-scrapping scheme in 
Germany that ended in September, started to fade. The exceptional crisis measures put in place in the EU and its 
major trading partners played a key role in turning th
e economy around, 
with inventory adjustment shaping the 
short-run dynamics. 
Looking ahead, recent data give a mixed picture. The 
global economy, most notabl
y emerging Asia, appears 
stronger than expected earlier, although it remains to be 
seen to what extent this will help the EU this year. 
Financial-market conditions have recovered since early 2009, but balance-sheet adjustment is not complete and 
uncertainty remains abundant. Improved sentiment indicators for the EU point to an expansion of activity going 
forward, but hard data, especially industrial production and retail sales, have been less encouraging recently. 

A sizeable slack in the economy conti
nues to keep inflation in ch
eck. With the main driving forces being still 
temporary in the EU and globally, the robustness of the recovery is yet to be tested, and a soft patch later this 
year is accordingly to be expected in the 
EU as well as in most
 developed economies. Based on an update for th
e seven largest EU Member States focusi
ng on growth and inflation this year, the 
economic outlook for the EU remains broadly unchanged from the Commission's autumn 2009 forecast. GDP 
growth is projected at 0.7% in both the EU and the euro area in 2010, with only marginal revisions for most 
individual Member States. Notwithstanding increased volatility in commodity and exchange rate markets, the 

inflation forecast also remains largely unchanged for 2010, with HICP inflation projected at 1.4% and 1.1% 
in the EU and the euro area respectively. 
The recent turbulence in financial markets illustrates well the high uncertainty that continues to surround 
economic projections. Risks to these projections thus remain high, but broadly balanced, with some risk factors, 

such as heightened turbulence in sovereign bond markets on the one hand and a more vigorous recovery of the 
world economy on the other, gaining importance since the autumn forecast.

    2 Interim forecast Februar
y 2010 
Temporary factors spur global recovery  Global economic activity
 proved more robust in the 
second half of 2009 than previously expected. The 
recovery was particularly fast in emerging Asia, but 
it was also strong in the US, where most of the 

growth in the second half of the year was driven by 
inventories. World real GDP (excluding the EU) 
could thus escape an outright fall last year, and is 
now expected to grow by some 4½% in 2010. For 
2010, this reflects an upward revision of about 

½ percentage point (pp.) relative to the 
Commission's autumn forecast. Nevertheless, the 
global recovery is still expected to be uneven and 

surrounded by major uncertainties.  
Regarding the near term, global indicators are 
encouraging, partly reflec
ting the inventory cycle in 
manufacturing. The global PMI for manufacturing 

reached its highest level for 5½ years in January 
2010, while for services it was much more subdued. 
The CPB world trade indicator also points to 

a strong momentum at the turn of the year: in the 
three months up to November 2009 (the latest 
available data), world trade was up by 5.7% from 

the preceding three months. Based on the revised 
global outlook, world trade (excluding the EU) is 
now expected to grow at around 7% in 2010.

 The upward revisions to global output and trade this 
year are mainly due to a 
higher carry-over from the 
stronger-than-expected outcomes in the second half 
of 2009. Further out, world growth is set to hit 
a soft patch, due to the gradually fading effect of 
the stimulus measures and because of the inventory 
cycle. Differences across countries remain sizeable, 

with a markedly more solid recovery in emerging 
economies, on the back of resuming capital inflows 
and the return of investors' risk appetite.  
 Financial markets sending mixed signals  The mood deteriorated quite significantly in some 
segments of 
financial markets
 at the start of 2010 
following growing concerns about the fiscal 
situation in developed economies, particularly in 

some euro-area countries. This has led to sharp 
increases in sovereign bond spreads in the euro area 
and a flight to quality, accompanied by a substantial 

pick-up in volatility. Developments have been, 
overall, more stable for equity and corporate bonds, 
reflecting encouragin
g corporate results. 
Money-market rates have remained low by 
historical standards, as ma
jor central banks have not 
signalled imminent large increases in policy interest 

rates. EU banks have continued to repair their balance 
sheets on the back of improved earnings and more 

favourable funding conditions. However, bank 
refinancing conditions remain far from normal, in 
particular as regards the availability of medium to 

long-term financing. The recovery of the banking 
sector still appears fragile, as further loan losses 
cannot be ruled out due to a weak economy and 

deteriorating labour markets. Bank lending to 
non-financial corporations has continued to decline 
in the euro area, while lending to households has 

recently turned 
positive. The latest ECB Bank 
Lending Survey points to a further, albeit slight, 
tightening of credit standards by euro-area banks. 

Overall, the state of the banking sector could limit 
lending to firms and households later in the 
recovery.   A modest EU recovery so far Regarding the real side, the EU economy ended 
2009 on a subdued note. In the final quarter of 
2009, 
GDP
 expanded by a mere 0.1% from the 
previous quarter in both the EU and the euro area. 

As predicted earlier, grow
th eased after a relatively 
strong third quarter (0.3% and 0.4% in the EU and 
    3Interim forecast Februar
y 2010 
the euro area respectivel
y), as the impact of 
temporary factors, such as the car-scrapping 
scheme in Germany, petered out. In 2009 as 

a whole, GDP contracted by 4.1% in the EU and 
4.0% in the euro area, in line with the 
Commission's autumn forecast. The carry-over for 

2010 GDP growth is also as expected. 
The weakness evident from hard data towards the 
end of 2009 was not limited to GDP data. Industrial 
production posted a substantial slowdown in the 

fourth quarter of last year. Construction activities 
also perform weakly, partly due to an unusually 
cold winter. Based on demand prospects that are 
subdued according to survey data, industrial output 
(including construction) is therefore set to remain 

sluggish throughout this year. Moreover, the 
important temporary factors that supported the 
rebound in GDP in the second half of last year 

should continue to wane, further dampening the 
momentum for economic activity.  
Recent data send mixed signals about the pace of 
the recovery. While a better-than-expected external 

environment could spur exports further, investment 
remains very weak and the labour market continues 
to deteriorate.  
As regards 
foreign demand
, extra-euro-area exports 
were on track for a further expansion in the fourth 
quarter according to monthly data up to November 
2009. Moreover, survey data from both the 

Commission surveys and PMI signalled robust 
export growth at the beginning of 2010. The 
question is how robust the global cycle will prove 
to be and how much EU economies will benefit 
from it. Lagged adverse ef
fects from the past euro 
appreciation cannot be excluded either. A rather 
cautious export outlook is 
therefore warranted, and 
the more muted the export recovery, the weaker the 

impetus for equipment investment. 
Equipment investment
 is expected to remain 
subdued this year for st
ructural and cyclical 
reasons. Deleveraging takes time and the 

exceptionally low capacity utilisation rate in 
manufacturing (73% in the first quarter of 2010) 
suggests that firms have room to expand production 

with the available capital stock. Moreover, despite 
improving demand, companies still tend to keep 
a low level of inventories. Given relatively strong 

new orders (and record-high level of new-orders-to-
inventory ratio), this suggests a high level of risk 
aversion by firms, which is likely to weigh on 
capital spending in the near term. 
Residential investment
 is also likely to be weak in 
2010. Given past experience, an undershooting 
following the pre-crisis construction bubble cannot 
be excluded in certain Member States. Leading 

supply indicators also continue to depict a weak 
outlook. For instance, while building permits have 
started to recover in the third quarter of 2009, they 

were still down by almost 17% from a year earlier. 
In contrast, 
non-residential construction investment
 is likely to expand over th
e forecast horizon, mostly 
on the back of government-financed infrastructure 
projects, partly offsetting the weakness of 

residential investment.

 A muted outlook for investment typically implies 
a weak labour market ahead, which in turn is likely 
to dampen 
private consumption
. Indeed, retail sales 
remain bleak and car registrations are flattening as 
the generous scrapping schemes are coming to an 
end in several countries. Although consumer 

confidence has shown a trend increase since March 
2009, its current level remains below the long-term 
average. On the other hand, the household saving 

rate may have peaked. After having risen by almost 
3 pps. during the previous four quarters, it declined 
in the third quarter of 2009, reflecting improved 

confidence. Moreover, demand for housing loans 
has turned positive in recent months, and still

  Growth forecast for the EU remains on track Overall, recent developments broadly confirm the 
near-term outlook of last autumn. Based on an 
update of the outlook for 2010 for the seven largest 
Member States, the for
ecast for GDP growth 
remains unchanged at 0.7% this year in both the EU 
and the euro area, with a broadly unchanged time 
profile of the recovery. The upswing remains muted 

for most of 2010, gaining some momentum only 
towards the end of the year. 
 Subdued outlook for inflation in the EU Consumer price
 inflation
 turned positive again in 
the euro area during last autumn, following 

a temporary dip into negative territory over the 
summer. The strong disinflation process over most 
of 2009 was mainly explained by downward base 

effects from the energy and food components and 
by a growing slack in the economy. 
Euro-area HICP inflation rose to 0.4% in the fourth 
quarter of 2009, slightly below the autumn 
projection (0.5%), while the full-year rate was in 
line with the forecast 
(0.3%). Core inflation 
(i.e. HICP inflation excluding energy and 
unprocessed food) also decl
ined in the course of 
2009, to 1.0% in the fourth quarter, down from 

2.2% one year earlier. For the EU as a whole, both 
the fourth-quarter and 
the full-year headline 
inflation estimates (1.0%) were in line with the 
autumn forecast.  
Reflecting the significant slowdown in economic 
activity, a sharp decline in inflation and 
deteriorating labour market conditions, 
wage 
growth
 in the euro area dropp
ed appreciably in the 
third quarter of 2009. Nevertheless, compared with 
historical averages, unit la
bour cost growth remains 
high, reflecting mostly productivity developments. 

 The projected rate of inflation
 remains unchanged 
for the euro area this year (1.1%), while it is 
marginally revised up in the EU (by 0.1 pp. to 
1.4%). However, the headline euro-area figure 

masks divergent developments across countries, 
with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands being 
revised slightly down, while inflation in France and 

Spain is now projected to 
be somewhat higher than 
in the autumn. Outside the euro area, inflation has 
been revised up more substantially, mainly due 

to a higher-than-expected pass-through from 
exchange-rate developm
ents to the headline 
inflation rate.

 Notwithstanding increased volatility in commodity 
and foreign exchange markets, underlying inflation 
trends remain largely unchanged: the projected 

sluggish recovery and a large slack in the economy 
are expected to offset pri
ce pressures from slightly 
higher oil and commodity prices (in euro terms) and 
a lower euro exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar. 
    5Interim forecast Februar
y 2010 
Full impact on labour market and public 
finances is still to come The labour market
 situation has continued to 
worsen in the past months, albeit the pace of 
deterioration has eased somewhat. Overall, the 

outcome appears to be in line with the autumn 
forecast. While GDP grow
th turned positive again 
in the third quarter of 2009, the number of persons 

employed continued to decrease, falling by 0.5% 
q-o-q in both the EU and in the euro area. This 
reflects the usual lag with which the labour markets 

tend to follow changes in GDP. The unemployment 
rate also continued to increase, reaching 10.0% in 
the euro area and 9.6% 
in the EU in December 
2009, almost 3 pps. above the lows of early 2008. 
Looking ahead, survey indicators of firms' 
employment expectations have improved in recent 
months, suggesting that the deterioration in the 

labour-market situation could level off in the course 
of 2010. As developments in the labour market 
have turned out broadly as
 expected in the autumn 
forecast, no significant ch
anges in the outlook for 
the near future appear 
warranted, conditional on 
economic growth in 2010 also being in line with the 
autumn forecast, as it is
 now expected. According 
to the autumn forecast, the unemployment rate in 

the EU was expected to already be lower in 2011 
compared to the previous 
year, whereas in the euro 
area unemployment was still expected to increase in 

2011. 
Turning to 
public finances
, available information 
suggests that, in line with the broadly unchanged 
outlook for economic activity, the 2010 budgetary 

position in the EU and the euro area should be 
broadly as expected in the autumn forecast.  
A full assessment of the prospects for public 
finances and labour markets will be carried out in 

the Commission's upcoming spring forecast.  
 Continued high uncertainty, but broadly 
balanced risks Amid continued high uncertainty, risks to the EU 
growth outlook 
for 2010 still appear broadly 
balanced. Recent economic developments have 

generally confirmed the baseline picture presented 
in the autumn, with most of the driving forces 
behind the recovery being of a temporary nature. 
The underlying momentum and robustness of the 
nascent EU recovery are not yet fully established. 
Moreover, in these early stages of the post-crisis 

recovery, economic growth is still facing a number 
of significant and unusual impediments, discussed 
in detail in the autumn forecast. Indeed, nearly all 

risk factors remain re
levant, although recent 
developments suggest that some of them may carry 
a larger weight than previously thought. 
On the 
downside
, recent developments in financial 
markets have shown that while the conditions are 
overall significantly better than a year ago, the 
situation remains highly uncertain and subject to 
serious downside risks. Mo
st recently, for instance, 
developments in sovereign bond markets indicate 

that mounting concerns about the sustainability of 
public finances in some Member States could have 
a stronger adverse impact 
than currently assumed. 
This could lead to higher-than-earlier-anticipated 
financing costs for firms and households, with 
adverse consequences on real activity, in the 

Member States where such concerns arise. In 
addition, there is a possibility that the effect could 
be broader, weighing further on the recovery. 
On the 
upside
, a more pronounced upturn in global 
demand has already materialised since the autumn 
forecast. The vigour of the global recovery, 
particularly in Asian emerging markets, may 

continue to surprise, posing an upside risk for EU 
export growth. Moreover, the turning of the 
inventory cycle in the EU could have a greater 
impact on domestic demand than currently 
anticipated, as could further improvements in 

sentiment.  
Turning to the 
inflation outlook
, risks also appear to 
remain broadly balanced for 2010. While the recent 
rebound in oil and other commodity prices and 

a weaker-than-previously-assumed exchange rate 
constitute upside risks to the inflation projection, 
large excess capacity, weak labour-market 

conditions and well-anchored inflation expectations 
are likely to prevail, containing inflationary 
pressures in the near term. 
    6 Interim forecast Februar
y 2010 
Growth and inflation prospects in the seven 
largest Member States  1. Germany Œ exports sustaining the recovery German real GDP is estimated to have contracted 
by 5.0% in 2009, in line 
with the autumn forecast. 
After the economy was severely hit by the collapse 
in world trade around the turn of 2008-09, 
it rebounded briskly in the second and third quarters 

by 0.4 and 0.7% respectively. This rebound was 
driven by expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, 
a sharp turnaround in the inventory cycle, and 

a recovery of world trade. Low inflation, stable 
employment levels and the car-scrapping scheme 
also underpinned relatively buoyant private 
consumption in the first half of the year. The 
recovery lost momentum in the final quarter of 

2009, however, when real GDP stagnated. While 
exports continued to expand strongly, the impetus 
from stock-building and the introduction of 

stimulus measures petered out and private 
consumption suffered a marked backlash from the 
expiry of the car-scrapping scheme.  
Despite steadily improving business climate 
indicators since early 2009, 
the recovery of industry 
stalled towards the end of the year. Industrial 
production dropped in D
ecember and new industrial 
orders remained flat in the final quarter. Due to this 
temporary halt in the recovery of industry and harsh 
weather conditions in the first two months of the 

year real GDP growth is set to remain flat in the 
first quarter of 2010. However, boosted by 
a technical, weather-related rebound, economic 

growth is projected to gather pace again from the 
second quarter onwards, 
largely owing to the 
improved outlook for world trade. While growth in 
the first half of the year is likely to remain largely 
export-driven, it is expected to become more 

broadly based in the second half as investment 
picks up and private consumption stabilises aided 
by additional fiscal stimulus measures introduced in 

2010. Despite a weaker st
art to the year than 
assumed in the autumn and a lower statistical 
carry-over from 2009, real
 GDP is projected to 
grow by 1.2% in the year as a whole Œ in line with 
the autumn forecast. 
HICP inflation turned out lower than expected in 
the last quarter of 2009 and January 2010, and 
given the considerable slack in the economy it 

should remain subdued. Therefore, despite an 
assumed increase in oil prices, the outlook for 
inflation in 2010 is slightly lower than in the 

autumn forecast.
  2. Spain Œ lower fall in economic activity Record high unemployment, a long structural 
adjustment of the residential construction sector and 
the on-going deleveraging process of households 
and firms are hampering a recovery of the Spanish 

economy. In quarterly terms,
 real GDP in Spain fell 
by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009 from -0.3% in 
the third quarter. For the year as a whole, economic 

activity is estimated to have contracted by 3.6%, in 
line with the autumn fo
recast. Car-scrapping 
schemes and improved confidence in the second 

half of the year, in pa
rallel with a favourable 
evolution in external demand, have contributed 
positively to this outcome. Domestic demand 

lowered GDP growth by 6¼ pps., while net external 
demand contributed positively by 2¾ pps. 
The outlook features a further, albeit much smaller, 
contraction of the economy in 2010. Real GDP is 

projected to fall by 0.6%, following a smaller 
contraction in domestic demand. Indeed, recent 
improvements in consumer and industry confidence 

suggest a faster recovery of domestic demand in 
2010 than previously anticipated. Still, a restrain of 
public consumption, tight credit conditions and 
a fading out of the positive effects of car-scrapping 
schemes are expected to partially hamper the 

recovery. The VAT-rate increase scheduled for 
mid-2010 is likely to bring forward consumption 
impacting on the quarterly GDP growth pattern. 

Exports are forecast to gr
ow over the next quarters 
faster than projected in autumn, reflecting some 
improvement in world demand. However, a more 

muted fall in imports, consistent with stronger 
domestic demand, would lead to a smaller positive 
contribution of the external sector to GDP growth. 
Inflation turned positive to 0.2% in the last quarter 
of 2009, compared with negative outcomes in 
earlier quarters. This inflationary rebound is mainly 
explained by energy price developments in 2009 
    7Interim forecast Februar
y 2010 
and by fading base effects of the 2008 oil price 
increases. Inflation is expected to rise in 2010 to 
1.1% on average, and to 1½% at the end of the 

year, on the back of higher oil prices and the VAT 
hike. After a significant increase in 2009, real 
wages are expected to m
oderate in 2010, following 
higher inflation and lower nominal increases 
included in recent wage agreements.

  3. France Œ strong growth at the end of 2009 
masks risks ahead The global financial crisis cast the French economy 
into recession, with quarte
r-on-quarter GDP growth 
rates of -1.5% and -1.4% in the last quarter of 2008 

and the first of 2009. However, with a contraction 
of economic activity of 
-2.2% in 2009, France was 
less affected by the crisis 
than its neighbours. GDP 
growth turned positive in the second quarter of 
2009, registering quarterly growth of 0.3%, 0.2% 
and 0.6% in the last three quarters of the year. 

A resilient private consumption contributed 
positively to GDP growth throughout 2009, 
supported by households™ income growth and 

stimulus measures, especially by the car-scrapping 
premium, the effect of wh
ich peaked in the fourth 
quarter. In the second quarter, the growth 

contribution of net trade was surprisingly positive 
owing to automotive production, which benefited 
strongly from car-scrapping schemes in 

neighbouring countries. But 
this proved short-lived, 
with the net trade contribution to growth turning 
negative again in the fourth quarter. The inventory 
cycle turned around in th
e third quarter, and was the 
strongest contributor to GDP growth in the fourth 
quarter. 
For 2010 as a whole, GDP growth is projected to 
return to positive territory, with an annual rate of 
1.2%. Temporary factors, such as the inventory 
cycle and the effects of stimulus measures, at play 

at the end of 2009 are set to last in the first quarter. 
From the second quarter onwards, activity is 
projected to slow down. Private consumption will 

suffer from muted increas
es in purchasing power 
and the expiry of the car
-scrapping premium. In 
addition, the uncertain demand outlook, the 
underutilisation of production capacities, the 
widespread declines in profits and the need for 

firms to strengthen their 
balance sheets, do not bode 
well for corporate investment. With the export 
market share of France in
 global trade declining, 
the growth impetus from exports is expected to 
remain lacklustre. 
The HICP inflation rate turned out very low in 2009 
(0.1%), reflecting base eff
ects associated with high 
food and energy prices in 2008. Year-on-year 
inflation bottomed out in the third quarter of 2009, 
however, and turned positive again in the fourth. In 

2010, HICP inflation is expected to remain 
relatively subdued, at 1.2%.  
 4. Italy Œ mild growth ahead Real GDP recorded a steep fall in 2009, dragged 
down by plummeting exports and a sharp decline in 
investment, especially in the first half of the year, 

while private consumption fell more moderately. 
However, following a quarterly contraction by 
2.7% and 0.5% in the first two quarters, GDP 

growth rebounded to 0.6% in the third quarter. The 
fourth quarter posted a renewed GDP contraction, 
by 0.2%, but business and consumer confidence 

indicators point to stronger economic activity in the 
current quarter. Real GDP is
 therefore set to expand 
again in the first quarter of 2010. 
Broadly confirming the Commission's autumn 2009 
forecast, a moderate recovery is expected in 2010. 
Real GDP is projected to gr
ow by 0.7% in the year 
as a whole, driven by relatively buoyant private 
consumption and exports. The former is set to 
    8 Interim forecast Februar
y 2010 
benefit from lower precautionary household 
savings, owing to the improved conditions in the 
financial markets, along with moderate inflation 

prospects. Exports are expected to receive 
a positive impulse from the strengthening of global 
demand. Low capacity utilisation in industry, on the 

other hand, is set to keep firms' investment plans 
subdued. 
The risks around this projection are broadly 
balanced. An upside risk to the GDP growth 

scenario is the possibility of a faster rise in world 
trade, which could further boost exports and 
subsequently investment. On the downside, lagged 
effects of the economic crisis on employment could 
negatively affect private consumption.  
As anticipated in the Commission's autumn 2009 
forecast, HICP inflation d
eclined markedly in 2009 
to 0.8% on average, due to
 the fall in energy prices 
and weak demand. It picked up in the last quarter of 

2009, as the favourable ba
se effects from energy 
prices started to fade out. In 2010, under the 
assumption of higher oil prices and recovering 

demand, it is projected to increase to 1.7% on 
average. 
 5. The Netherlands Œ trade to turn tables again In 2009, economic activity experienced a severe 
contraction of 4%. The contraction was 
concentrated in the first half of the year, with the 
first and second quarter showing negative 

quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.3% and 1.1% 
respectively. The economy rebounded in the third 
and fourth quarter with positive growth of 0.5% and 

0.3% respectively. This growth profile during the 
year reflected in large pa
rt external developments, 
with net exports contributing negatively to growth 

in the first half and positively in the second, as 
expected, in view of the sensitivity of the Dutch 
economy to world trade. Domestic demand was 

a drag on growth throughout the year as private 
consumption contracted due to important negative 
wealth and confidence effects stemming from the 

financial crisis. Investment suffered from 
decreasing demand, lower profitability and 
tightening credit conditions. Government 

consumption was the only factor supporting 
domestic demand growth, mainly owing to the 
fiscal stimulus package amounting to 1% of GDP.  
For 2010, GDP growth is expected to turn positive 
again at 0.9%. Net trade is
 most likely to be the 
main driver as exports ar
e likely to benefit from 
a further recovery of world trade and to outpace 
import growth. As firms are grappling with a very 
low capacity utilisation rate, decreased profitability 

and tighter credit conditions, investment will 
continue to suffer. Despite a tendency of confidence 
to improve, private consumption is set to remain 

subdued, as real disposab
le income is negatively 
affected by lower wage growth and increasing 
unemployment. The latter is likely to increase 
strongly in 2010 after a relatively favourable 
development in 2009. Most importantly, some 

mitigating effects that played an important role in 
2009, such as labour hoarding and part-time 
unemployment measures, are expected to gradually 

disappear.  The inflation rate is likely to remain subdued in the 
first half, mainly because of a negative contribution 
of energy prices, which ar
e related to a decrease in 
prices for gas and electric
ity. Energy prices should 
contribute positively again to inflation in the second 
half of 2010, resulting from a base effect. Overall 

for 2010, inflation is expected to come out at 0.8%.

  6. Poland Œ A front-runner in the recovery phase Economic activity accelerated substantially towards 
the end of 2009, with real GDP increasing by an 
estimated 1.7% in the fourth quarter from 0.1%, 
    9Interim forecast Februar
y 2010 
0.5% and 0.5% respectivel
y, in the preceding three 
quarters. The upswing was driven by a sharp 
increase in public investment (partly co-financed by 

EU funds) and a rebound of exports. Private 
consumption continued to increase, supported by 
better-than-expected employment performance and 

cuts in the personal income tax rates. Overall, real 
GDP growth reached 1.7% 
in 2009, the highest and 
only positive growth rate in the EU and ½ pp. more 

than projected by the Co
mmission last autumn.  
In 2010, real GDP growth 
is expected to accelerate 
to 2½%, i.e. ¾ pp. higher than predicted in the 
autumn forecast. Real GDP 
is projected to remain 
stable in the first quarter of 2010 Œ as high 
frequency indicators point to a technical correction 

after the strong increase in the fourth quarter of 
2009 Œ and to accelerate gr
adually over the year. 
The recovery would continue to be driven by 

exports, which will benefit from the rebound in 
external demand and the lagging positive effects of 
the past exchange rate depreciation. The latter 

effect will however gradually fade away and 
domestic demand will become the main driver of 
growth in 2010. Investment is projected to recover 

slowly after the drop recorded in 2009. This will 
reflect robust public
 spending in capital 
expenditure, firming-up production expectations 

and improved perception of the Polish economy 
among foreign investors (attracting FDI inflows). 
Private consumption is e
xpected to contribute 
moderately positively to growth. It will be 
supported by a marked incr
ease in social transfers 
and better-than-expected 
developments in the 
labour market, where the sharper-than-anticipated 
adjustment of real wages 
is cushioning the effects 
of the downturn on employment.  
HICP inflation reached
 4% y-o-y in 2009, 
marginally higher than in the autumn forecast. It is 
expected to remain clos
e to the central bank's 
inflation target of 2.5% 
over the forecast horizon, 
reflecting the large negative output gap caused by 
the crisis.  
 7. The United Kingdom Œ emerging from the 
recession with little momentum After having posted 2.5% and 0.7% contractions in 
the first two quarters of 2009, UK GDP fell further 
in the third quarter of 2009 (-0.2%), in line with the 
Commission's autumn forecast, making it the 
seventh successive fall in quarterly output. Overall, 

the strength of domestic demand surprised 
somewhat in the third quarter, as private 
consumption levels stabilised, and fixed investment 

rebounded noticeably, a
lthough stock building 
partly offset the resulting lift to GDP. Due in part to 
the resilience of disposable income growth 

throughout the recession (helped by lower interest 
rates, tax reductions and higher benefit payments), 
the aggregate household saving rate rose to around 
8% in the third quarter, up from zero in early 2008. 
Preliminary GDP and other data suggest that the 

UK economy expanded only marginally (0.1%) in 
the fourth quarter of 2009, apparently driven by 
domestic demand growth. By contrast, net external 

demand exerted a drag on growth in both the third 
and Œ according to monthly trade data Œ fourth 
quarters, thus indicating that the economy was still 

failing to rebalance towards external demand 
following sterling's depreciation over the past two 
years. Unemployment levels broadly stabilised in 

late 2009. In 2009 as a whole GDP is now 
estimated to have contracted by 4.8%. 
Sentiment indicators suggest that positive output 
growth in the fourth quarter carried over into 2010, 

particularly in manufacturing. However, the impact 
of the January 2010 reversal of the VAT cut and 
poor January weather are 
likely to depress private 
consumption in the first quarter. In view of the 
lower-than-expected mome
ntum evident in the 
fourth quarter, this suggests a slightly weaker GDP 
growth profile in the first half of 2010. On an 
annual basis, growth of 0.6% is expected in 2010, 

marked by a continued domestic demand weakness 
driven by the household and government sectors. 
HICP inflation rose in the final quarter of 2009, due 
to a base effect from December 2008's VAT 

reduction, a higher pass-through from import prices 
to consumer goods and sharp falls in the price of oil 
in late 2008. Inflation is expected to increase 

further in the first quarter, due to VAT-linked 
prices rises, but in view
 of the large amount of 
spare capacity these te
mporary factors should 
gradually soon give way to a renewed moderation 
of inflation.

BOX: TECHNICAL BACKGROUND TO THE INTERIM FORECAST
  Technical background In February 2006, the Commission presented the first of 
what are now twice-yearly interim forecasts with the 
objective of updating its comprehensive spring and 
autumn economic forecasts (w
ith the next fully-fledged 
forecast scheduled for 6 May 2010). This interim forecast 
updates the outlook of the autumn 2009 economic 
forecast of 3 November 2009. The cut-off date for this 
interim forecast to take new information on board was 15 
February 2010. 
The interim forecast updates the outlook for the largest 
seven EU Member States i.e. Germany, Spain, France, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Po
land and the United Kingdom 
(which are the largest in the EU based on an average of 
the ranking in terms of both population and nominal 
GDP). The update covers real GDP growth and HICP 
inflation for the current year
. These updates are prepared 
using indicator-based forecas
ting models or judgemental 
forecasting techniques.  
Estimates for the European Union and the euro area are 
prepared using the nominal GDP-weighted updates for 
the largest Member States. These countries account for 
79% of the European Union and 83% of the euro area in 

terms of nominal GDP. Th
e outlook for the smaller 
Member States has not been updated. The Commission 
has made projections for the euro area and the EU using 
the updates for the five and se
ven largest Member States 
respectively, and assuming that the revision for 
quarter-on-quarter growth ra
tes for the smaller Member 
States is equal to that of the larger ones. 
Quarterly data are updated with the latest available 
information. When comparing quarterly with annual GDP 
growth it must be kept in mind that, whenever possible, 
quarterly data are adjusted for both seasonal influences 
and the number of working days while annual data is 
presented in unadjusted form. Calendar factors are, 
however, relatively small in 2010. 
       External conditions  This forecast is based on a 
set of external assumptions. 
These assumptions are based 
on market expectations at 
the time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions from 
possible volatility during one
 specific trading day, 
averages from a 10-day reference period have been used 
for all technical assumptions.  
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates has 
been standardised using fixed nominal exchange rates for 
all currencies. They are kept constant based on the 
averages from 10 days up to 15 February, implying e.g. 
an annual average of USD/EUR of 1.38.  
Interest rates assumptions
 are, since spring 2007, 
market-based instead of expert-based. These assumptions 
should be interpreted with caution, as market-based 
assumptions do not only reflec
t policy rate expectations, 
but also liquidity conditions in this period of market 
uncertainty. Short-term interest rates for the euro area are 
derived from future contracts.
 Long-term interest rates for 
the euro area, as well as s
hort- and long-term interest 
rates for Poland and the UK are calculated using implicit 
forward swap rates, corrected for the spread between the 
3-month interbank interest rate and the 3-month 

swap-rate. As a result, the shor
t-term rate is at 0.9% and 
the long-term interest rates at 3.3% in 2010 for the euro 
area. 
The outlook for oil prices is based on futures prices. The 
price for a barrel of Brent crude
 oil is projected at 75.7 
USD/barrel in 2010 (corresponding to 54.7 EUR/barrel). 
This would be 0.8 USD/barre
l lower (or 3.0 EUR/barrel higher) than assumed in the autumn 2009 forecast, 
reflecting an improved 
global outlook and demand expectations from e.g. emerging markets (as well as 
exchange rate movements).  
Global demand in 2010 is revised upwards, following the 
stronger-than-expected growth in the second half of 2009 
in emerging economies, United States (where it has been 
led by inventories), and a rebound in world trade and 
industrial production. Global GDP growth, excluding the 
EU, is now forecast to accel
erate to 4.4% in 2010 (up 
from 0.1% in 2009), about ½ pp. higher than expected in 
the autumn forecast (3.8%). World trade is set to rise 
substantially in 2010, with growth in export and import 
volumes (excluding the EU) estimated at around 7% 
(compared with an average 12% fall in 2009).
