10ECB Annual Report
2010In 2010 monetary policy operated in an 
environment characterised by the economic 

recovery in the euro area on the one hand and 

a persistence of tensions in Þ nancial markets 
on the other. The recovery in the real economy 

during 2010 turned out to be somewhat 

stronger than expected. This was partly 

related to the recovery in the world economy, 

but domestic developments also contributed 

to the prevailing positive momentum. Overall, 

euro area real GDP increased by around 1.7% 

in 2010, following a decline of 4.1% in 2009. 

As regards prices, inß ation rates increased 
in the course of 2010, mainly reß ecting rises 
in global commodity prices. At the same time, 

underlying domestic inß ationary pressures 
remained moderate. As a consequence, 

the average annual inß ation rate rose to 1.6% 
in 2010, up from 0.3% in 2009.In this environment, in 2010 and early 2011 
the Governing Council kept the rate on the 

main reÞ nancing operations unchanged at 
the historically low level of 1% that was set 

in May 2009. This was consistent with its 

assessment that the medium-term outlook for 

inß ation remained in line with price stability 
in 2010. More favourable growth expectations 

and short-term inß ation dynamics were thus 
not seen as threatening price stability in the 

medium term. Money and credit developments 

conÞ rmed the assessment that in
ß ationary 
pressures beyond the short term should remain 

contained. Inß ation expectations remained 
Þ rmly anchored in line with the Governing 
Council™s aim of keeping inß ation rates 
below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. 

This reß ects favourably on the high degree 
of credibility of the ECB™s monetary policy. 
With regard to the non-standard monetary policy measures taken by the Eurosystem in 
response to the Þ nancial crisis, improvements in 
Þ nancial market conditions in 2009 and the 
Þ rst few months of 2010 allowed the ECB to reduce 
its intermediation role. Acute Þ nancial tensions 
resurfaced in May. These developments could 
be interpreted as resulting from growing market 
concerns about the sustainability of public Þ nances, especially in Greece, 
with clear signs of contagion affecting other euro area government 
bond markets.  Liquidity in those segments 
of the euro secondary debt market dried up. 
Moreover, rating revisions and price declines 
implied frequent margin calls and the downward 
revaluation of the assets of the banking system, 
leading to sudden and sharp reductions in the 
value of banks™ collateral. Eventually, private 
repurchase agreement markets were affected. 
Money market spreads widened again, while 
volumes in the overnight segment declined, 
bid-ask spreads widened, and the covered bond 
market, as well as the corporate bond market, was 

affected. In response, the Governing Council 
reintroduced some non-standard measures that 
had already been phased out or were scheduled 
to be phased out. In particular, the Eurosystem 
decided to maintain the Þ xed rate tender 
procedure with full allotment in the regular 
three-month longer-term reÞ nancing operations 
11ECB Annual Report
2010for the period from end-May to end-December, and announced a new six-month reÞ nancing operation with full allotment that took place in 
May. Moreover, the temporary liquidity swap 
lines with the US Federal Reserve System 
were also resumed and a Securities Markets 
Programme was launched. This programme 
has enabled the Eurosystem to intervene in 
bond markets to help restore a more appropriate 
functioning of the monetary policy transmission 
mechanism in the case of dysfunctional market 
segments. The liquidity effects stemming from 
these purchases have been fully neutralised by 
weekly liquidity-absorbing operations.***Regarding Þ nancial reform, signi
Þ cant steps were undertaken in 2010 to increase the 

resilience of the Þ nancial sector. At the 
global level, the ambitious agenda agreed upon 

by the G20 ministers and governors gave 

the impetus for the milestones achieved. 

The agreement reached by the Basel Committee 

and approved by the Group of Governors and 

Heads of Supervision on the Basel III package 

constitutes a substantial strengthening of the 

capital and liquidity requirements for banks, 

forming a cornerstone of the new prudential 

framework. The ECB fully supports the new 

framework and is of the view that the agreed 

gradual implementation of the Basel III 

package should be a key priority.Another important strand of work for 
strengthening the resilience of the Þ nancial 
system has been the work by the Financial 

Stability Board in developing an integrated 

framework to reduce the risks and externalities 

associated with systemically important 

Þ nancial institutions. The ECB, being a 
member of the Financial Stability Board, 

considers it important that a proper framework 

is developed that ensures a high degree of 

international consistency, thus promoting a 

level playing Þ eld and minimising the risk of 
regulatory arbitrage. 
The reform of the framework for crisis 

prevention, management and resolution 

gained momentum in 2010. This reform aims 

at implementing an EU policy coordination 

framework and enhancing the EU™s regulatory 

framework. The ECB has actively contributed 

to this work and the Eurosystem supported the 

development of an EU resolution framework. 
The establishment of the European Systemic 
Risk Board (ESRB) on 16 December 2010 

marked a major milestone in terms of Europe 

learning lessons from the crisis. The ESRB will 

conduct macro-prudential oversight in the EU, 

identify, assess and prioritise systemic risks, 

and issue warnings and recommendations under 

an ﬁact or explainﬂ regime. Together with the 

new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) 

and the national supervisory authorities, the 

ESRB forms part of the new European System 

of Financial Supervision (ESFS). The ECB 

ensures the Secretariat of the ESRB and 

provides the ESRB with analytical, statistical, 

logistical and administrative support. The 

preparatory work for the ESRB at the ECB 

started with the setting-up of the ESRB 

Preparatory Secretariat on 1 March 2010. 

The decision-making body of the ESRB held 

its Þ rst meeting on 20 January 2011.
The ECB continued to contribute to the key 

policy and regulatory initiatives aimed at 

enhancing the stability of Þ nancial market 
infrastructures, in particular as regards 

over-the-counter derivatives. In April 2010 

the ECB published a report on the lessons 

learned from the Þ nancial crisis with regard to 
the functioning of European Þ nancial market 
infrastructures. Furthermore, an assessment 

of systemically important payment systems 

conducted by central banks showed that 

business continuity and crisis communication 

arrangements are maintained at high standards 

by the respective system operators. In addition, 

the ECB continued to act as a catalyst for private 

sector activities by facilitating collective action. 

With regard to the Single Euro Payments Area 
12ECB Annual Report
2010(SEPA), the ECB strongly supported the work 
of European legislators to create the necessary 

momentum to complete the SEPA project. 

The envisaged regulation establishing end 

dates for the migration to SEPA, under which 

the usage of national payment instruments will 

be discontinued, is key to ensuring the timely 

and smooth adoption of SEPA.In the Þ eld of central bank services, the 
Eurosystem operates the large-value payment 
system TARGET2. The single platform of 

TARGET2 facilitates the real-time gross 

settlement of transactions in euro and enables 

23 EU central banks and their respective 

user communities to beneÞ t from the same 
comprehensive and advanced services. 

Substantial progress was made in 2010 on 

the Eurosystem™s programme for a new 

multi-currency securities settlement solution 

called TARGET2-Securities (T2S). Key policy 

issues were advanced or Þ nalised during 
the year, with, for example, the decision on 

the pricing policy and the establishment of a 

governance framework laying down the ways 

in which the Eurosystem, non-euro area central 

banks, central securities depositories and 

market participants will be able to participate in 

the future development and operation of T2S. 

Work also progressed on the establishment of 

a single platform (CCBM2) for Eurosystem 

collateral mobilisation. This system, which 

is planned to go live in 2013, will allow 

the Eurosystem to provide efÞ cient and 
cost-optimised collateral management and 

enhanced liquidity management services to 

Eurosystem counterparties.***Turning to organisational issues, the ECB had 

1,421.5 full-time equivalent positions at the 

end of 2010, compared with 1,385.5 positions 

at the end of 2009. The increase is mainly 

due to the new tasks assigned to the ECB in 
relation to the ESRB Secretariat and support 

for the ESRB more generally. The members of 

staff of the ECB come from all 27 EU Member 

States and are recruited by means of open 

selection campaigns to Þ ll vacancies published 
on the ECB™s website. In line with the ECB™s 

mobility policy, 204 members of staff moved 

internally to other positions in 2010, while 

eight members of staff were seconded to other 

organisations for external work experience and 

36 were granted unpaid leave to study or take 

up employment with other organisations or for 

personal reasons. The continuous acquisition 

and development of skills and competencies by 

all members of staff remained a cornerstone of 

the ECB™s human resources strategy.Developments related to corporate culture 
focused on diversity and professional ethics. 

The ECB is fully committed to diversity and 

has made its policy public. An enhanced Ethics 

Framework for the members of staff of the 

ECB entered into force in 2010.The ceremonial laying of the foundation 
stone on 19 May 2010 marked the ofÞ cial 
start of the main construction works for the 

new ECB premises. At the beginning of 2010 

the respective public tender procedures were 

successfully Þ nalised and the contracts for 
work representing around 80% of the calculated 

construction costs were awarded within the 

envisaged budget. The completion date for the 

new premises is scheduled for the end of 2013.Regarding its Þ nancial accounts, the ECB earned 
a surplus of •1.33 billion in 2010, compared with a surplus of •2.22 billion in 2009. The 
Governing Council decided to transfer, as at 
31 December 2010, an amount of •1.16 billion 
to the provision for foreign exchange rate, 
interest rate, credit and gold price risks, thereby 
increasing it to its ceiling of •5.18 billion, 
which was the value of the ECB™s capital 
paid up by the euro area NCBs as at that date. 13ECB Annual Report
2010The size of this provision is reviewed annually. The ECB™s net proÞ t for 2010, following the 
transfer to the provision, was •170 million. 
This amount was distributed to the euro area 
NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in 
the ECB™s capital.Frankfurt am Main, March 2011Jean-Claude TrichetThe new ECB premises: view from the east, with the city centre of Frankfurt am Main in the background.CHAPTER 1ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS ANDMONETARY POLICY16ECBAnnual Report
2010In 2010 the Eurosystem was once again faced 
with a very challenging environment, with 

renewed tensions in Þ nancial markets. Severe 
stress was observed in some euro area bond 

markets, particularly from May 2010, reß ecting 
the sovereign debt crisis. On the positive side, 

the outlook for inß ation remained moderate, with 
neither deß ationary nor in
ß ationary pressures 
over the policy-relevant horizon. HICP inß ation 
increased gradually over the year and stood at 

1.6% on average in 2010, against 0.3% in 2009. 

Developments in economic growth were 

relatively favourable in 2010, especially taking 

into account the severe economic downturn in 

2009, with data releases and surveys in the course 

of the year generally indicating a somewhat better 

economic performance than had been expected. 

In this environment, the Governing Council 

viewed the accommodative monetary policy 

stance as appropriate and therefore left the key 

ECB interest rates unchanged at the historically 

low levels that they reached in May 2009. The 

interest rate on the main reÞ nancing operations 
stood at 1.00% throughout 2010, the rate on 

the deposit facility at 0.25% and the rate on the 

marginal lending facility at 1.75% (see Chart 1). 
Taking a closer look at interest rate 
developments since the Þ nancial crisis 
intensiÞ ed following the collapse of the 
US Þ nancial institution Lehman Brothers 
on 15 September 2008, some key dates 

introducing a new phase of the Þ nancial crisis 
can be highlighted (see Chart 2).Positive developments in the functioning of 

the money market in the course of 2009 paved 

the way for some of the non-standard measures 

taken to enhance the functioning of the monetary 

policy transmission mechanism to be phased 

out in early 2010. However, in May 2010 a new 

episode of the crisis started to unfold. As market 

concerns about the sustainability of public 

Þ nances increased, particularly in some euro

role of government bond markets in the monetary

exceptional circumstances. They are, by construction, temporary in nature. Indeed, in early 

2010 some non-standard measures that were no longer needed were phased out, as had been 

decided by the Governing Council in December 2009, on the back of improved conditions in 

Þ nancial markets and evidence that the monetary policy transmission mechanism was working 
more normally again. SpeciÞ cally, the Governing Council decided in December 2009: that 
the 12-month longer-term reÞ nancing operation (LTRO) in that month would be the last one 
with that maturity; that only one more six-month LTRO would be conducted (in March 2010); 

and that the supplementary three-month LTROs would be discontinued. Furthermore, 

in coordination with other central banks, the ECB discontinued the temporary foreign currency 

liquidity-providing operations in February 2010. Moreover, in March 2010 it was decided to return 

to a variable rate tender procedure in the three-month LTROs. Finally, the Covered Bond Purchase 

Programme, which was initiated in May 2009 for a one-year period, was completed in June 2010, 

after the Eurosystem had bought •60 billion of euro-denominated euro area covered bonds as 
planned. At the same time, other elements of the ECB™s enhanced credit support, such as the use of the Þ xed rate full allotment procedure in main re
Þ nancing operations, remained in place.
In spring 2010 tensions re-emerged in certain segments of the Þ nancial markets, in particular in some euro area government bond markets. Spreads for the ten-year government bonds of some euro 1 More information on the ECB™s response to the 
Þ nancial crisis, from the start of the crisis to early September 2010, can be found in the

2010area countries relative to German government bonds started to increase very quickly (see
the chart). This was mainly driven by increased 
market concerns about the sustainability of 
public Þ nances in some euro area countries, 
in view of rising government deÞ cits and debt. 
The widening of spreads accelerated in April 
and early May 2010, and on 6 and 7 May they 
reached levels unprecedented since the start 
of EMU.2 This led euro area governments to announce a comprehensive package of 
measures, including the European Financial 
Stability Facility, on 9 May.In this context, on 10 May 2010 the Eurosystem announced the launch of the Securities 

Markets Programme. Under this programme, 

Eurosystem interventions can be carried 

out in the euro area public and private debt 
securities markets, with the aim of ensuring 
depth and liquidity in dysfunctional market 
segments and restoring the proper functioning 
of the monetary policy transmission 

mechanism. The government bond markets 

play an essential role in the monetary policy 
transmission process, operating through the 
following channels. Interest rates on government bonds are 
 Œ
usually one of the main determinants 

of the interest rates that Þ nancial and 
non-Þ nancial Þ rms have to pay when 
issuing their bonds (the ﬁprice channelﬂ). 

When bond markets are severely 

disrupted, the short-term interest rates 

of the central bank are no longer passed 

on to the appropriate degree to longer-
term rates that are relevant to decisions 

of households and Þ rms, and, hence,
to prices. 
The sharply lower bond prices that are implied by the much higher longer-term interest rates  Œ
on account of disrupted bond markets cause signiÞ cant losses in the portfolios of 
Þ nancial and 
non-Þ nancial sectors; this would reduce banks™ ability to provide loans to the economy 
(the ﬁbalance sheet channelﬂ). 2 For more information, see the box entitled ﬁDevelopments in

2010Exceptionally low liquidity in government bond markets would constrain the use of  Œ
government bonds as collateral in reÞ nancing operations, thereby also hindering banks™ 
supply of loans (the ﬁliquidity channelﬂ). Therefore, the decision to start intervening in bond markets was taken in order to help maintain the appropriate transmission of monetary policy to the real economy in the euro area by 
addressing the malfunctioning of some segments of the securities markets. In accordance with 
the provisions of the Treaty, any Eurosystem purchases of government bonds have been strictly 
limited to secondary markets. Following the statements by euro area governments and by the ECB on 9 and 10 May 2010, tensions in Þ nancial markets abated for a short period of time, before spreads started widening 
again in a number of countries in the remainder of the year.The increase in liquidity as a result of the bond purchases made in the context of the Securities Markets Programme is fully sterilised by means of speciÞ c operations to reabsorb it, 
as it is not the aim of the programme to inject additional liquidity into the banking system. 
The prevailing level of liquidity and the money market rates (in other words, the monetary 
policy stance) are therefore not affected by the programme, which consequently poses no 
inß ationary risks. At the end of 2010 the Eurosystem had intervened in bond markets for an 
amount of •73.5 billion and had absorbed liquidity in the money market for exactly the 
same amount.In addition to implementing  this new non-standard measure, on 3 May 2010 the ECB suspended the application of the minimum credit rating threshold in the collateral eligibility requirements 
in the case of bonds issued or guaranteed by the Greek government after the joint EU and 
IMF programme for Greece had been Þ nalised. Furthermore, in early May it reintroduced 
some of the non-standard measures that had been withdrawn earlier, in order to avoid negative 
spillovers from domestic sovereign bond markets to other Þ nancial markets. There was a risk 
that the normal functioning of markets could become impaired, notably the initial link in the 
monetary policy transmission mechanism between the central bank and credit institutions. 
In turn, this could have seriously impaired the ability of banks, which are the primary source 
of Þ nancing in the euro area, to provide credit to the real economy. In particular, the Eurosystem 
reintroduced the Þ xed rate tender procedure with full allotment in the regular three-month 
LTROs for the period starting at the end of May, and a new six-month reÞ nancing operation 
with full allotment was conducted in May. The temporary liquidity swap lines with the Federal 
Reserve System were also resumed. Given the continuing tensions in some government bond market segments and continued high 
uncertainty, the Governing Council decided in its meetings in September and December 2010 that 

all longer-term Eurosystem reÞ nancing operations to be allotted in the last quarter of 2010 and 
the Þ rst quarter of 2011 respectively would be conducted as Þ xed rate tender procedures with full 
allotment. The rates in these LTROs were Þ xed at the average of the rates on the main re
Þ nancing 
operations over the life of the respective LTRO. Throughout 2010 the main reÞ nancing operations 
were conducted at Þ xed rates with full allotment.
20ECBAnnual Report
2010Following the sharp contraction experienced in 2008-09, euro area economic growth 
turned positive again at the end of 2009 and 
continued to grow in 2010. Quarterly real 
GDP growth rates in the Þ rst half of 2010 
were better than expected, reß ecting in part 
considerable support from Þ scal stimuli and the 
accommodative monetary policy stance, as well 
as the rebound in global economic activity. 
In line with expectations, economic growth 
moderated somewhat in the second half of the 
year, while the underlying momentum of the 
euro area recovery remained positive. Overall, 
euro area real GDP increased by around 
1.7% in 2010 after having contracted by 4.1% 
in 2009. Inß ationary pressures remained moderate 
in 2010, with some upward pressure emerging at the end of the year and in early 2011. 
The average annual inß ation rate in 2010 stood 
at 1.6%. Month-on-month developments in the 
inß ation rate were noteworthy, as annual HICP 
inß ation gradually increased in 2010, rising from 
a low of 0.9% in February to 2.2% in December. 
The gradual increase in HICP inß ation mainly 
reß ected developments in commodity prices, 
driven by the global economic recovery and by 
base effects. Market-based and survey-based 
measures of long-term inß ation expectations 
remained broadly anchored at levels consistent 
with the Governing Council™s aim of keeping 
inß ation rates below, but close to, 2% in the 
medium term. The pace of monetary expansion in the euro area gradually increased in 2010. M3 growth, 
however, remained low, at an average rate of 
0.6% in 2010. This supported the assessment 
that the underlying pace of monetary expansion 
was moderate and that inß ationary pressures 
over the medium term were contained. 
The monetary analysis used as a basis for the 
analysis and assessment of money and credit 
developments has been greatly enhanced over 
time and this has deepened the ECB™s medium-
term-oriented monetary policy strategy.1THE GRADUAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY
AND THE PHASING-OUT OF SOME 

NON-STANDARD MEASURES 
Looking at monetary policy decisions in 2010 
in more detail, information and analyses that 
had become available at the beginning of 
the year indicated that a moderate economic 
recovery was under way in the euro area, 
in part supported by temporary factors. 
Moreover, the recovery was likely to be 
uneven. In particular, economic growth rates 
and inß ation developments diverged somewhat 
across euro area countries, although to a lesser 
extent than in 2009. The divergence mainly 
resulted from the ongoing rebalancing processes 
within the euro area, being the mirror image of 
the unsustainable growth patterns observed in 
some countries before the crisis. Macroeconomic forecasts and projections for the euro area remained broadly unchanged 
in spring 2010. The March 2010 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections foresaw annual real 
GDP growth in a range between 0.4% and 1.2% 
in 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.5% in 2011. 
Price developments were expected to remain 
subdued over the policy-relevant horizon, with 
HICP inß ation projected to be between 0.8% 
and 1.6% in 2010, and between 0.9% and 2.1% 
in 2011. The cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals from the monetary 
analysis continued to conÞ rm the assessment 
of low inß ationary pressures over the medium 
term. The growth rates of money and credit 
remained low, although the growth rate of 
money somewhat overstated the deceleration 
in the underlying pace of monetary expansion 
owing to the steep slope of the yield curve, 
which caused shifts out of M3. For more information, see the article entitled ﬁEnhancing 1 monetary analysisﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, November 2010; and Papademos, L. and Stark, J. (eds.), Enhancing monetary analysis, ECB, 2010. 21ECBAnnual Report
2010At the start of 2010 the Governing Council began to gradually phase out liquidity measures that 
were no longer needed to the same extent as in 
the past, in accordance with the decisions taken 
in December 2009. In particular, the number of 
longer-term reÞ nancing operations was reduced. 
These steps were taken against the background 
of improving conditions in Þ nancial markets, 
including the money market, in the course of 
2009. However, the Eurosystem continued to 
provide extraordinary liquidity support to the 
banking system of the euro area, facilitating 
the provision of credit to the euro area economy 
in an environment of continuing uncertainty. 
As a result, the overnight interest rate continued 
to stand close to the rate on the deposit facility, 
as it had done ever since the introduction of the 
Þ xed rate tender procedure with full allotment 
in October 2008. Prior to that, very short-term 
money market interest rates had been steered 
primarily by the minimum bid rate on the main 
reÞ nancing operations. 
THE CRISIS IN SOME SOVEREIGN BOND MARKETS 

FROM MAY 2010 
High government deÞ cits, rapidly increasing 
government debt-to-GDP ratios and rising 
contingent liabilities on account of guarantees 
for banks set the stage for a reintensiÞ cation of 
the Þ nancial crisis. Market pressure had already been building up towards the end of 2009 and in 
early 2010, but it culminated in early May 2010, 
with the spreads of some euro area sovereign 
bonds against the German benchmark bond 
reaching levels not seen since the introduction 
of the euro. This was particularly the case for 
the yield on Greek government bonds, which 
reached very high levels compared with the 
German benchmark bond, but yields on the 
bonds of some other governments were also 
affected. In view of the role of government bond 
markets in the transmission of monetary policy 
to the economy and, ultimately, prices, the ECB 
launched its Securities Markets Programme, 
enabling the Eurosystem to purchase public and 
private bonds. Macroeconomic developments in the Þ rst half of 
2010 were more favourable than expected, in spite of the impact of the sovereign debt crisis. These 
positive developments generally led to substantial 

upward revisions of macroeconomic forecasts 

and projections for the euro area published later 

in the year, including the June 2010 Eurosystem 

staff macroeconomic projections. At the same 

time, the remainder of the year was 
expected 
to witness somewhat lower growth rates, 
albeit with a positive underlying momentum. 

In the September 2010 ECB staff projections, 

annual real GDP growth was expected to 

be between 1.4% and 1.8% in 2010, and 

between 0.5% and 2.4% in 2011. This implied 

a substantial upward revision for 2010 compared 

with the June 2010 Eurosystem staff projections, 

which had included growth projections of 

between 0.7% and 1.3% for 2010. 
Improving macroeconomic conditions were accompanied by more favourable credit 
developments. In the autumn of 2010 it became 
increasingly clear that a turning point in the 
annual growth rate of loans to the private sector 
had been reached earlier in the year. While the 
annual growth rate of loans to households had 
already reached a turning point in the third 
quarter of 2009, the annual growth rate of loans 
to non-Þ nancial corporations did not become 
less negative until the latter part of 2010. 
This pattern was broadly consistent with the 
lagged response of developments in loans to 
non-Þ nancial corporations to economic activity 
over the business cycle that had been observed 
in past cycles. After broadly stabilising in the Þ rst half of 2010, 
the euro overnight index average (EONIA) increased slightly in the second half of the year, 
on account of a gradual reduction in the amount 
of excess liquidity. Given that in this period the 
ECB continued to supply unlimited amounts of 
liquidity to MFIs, against eligible collateral, at 
the Þ xed rate applied in the main re
Þ nancing operations, the developments in the EONIA 
were demand-driven. Therefore, they were 
not to be taken as a sign of a tightening of the 
monetary policy stance. Rather, the reduction in 
banks™ demand for Eurosystem Þ nancing could 
be interpreted as reß ecting improved access to 
22ECBAnnual Report
2010market-based funding, such as bank securities and interbank lending. Towards the end of 2010 tensions intensiÞ ed again in certain bond markets, reß ecting increased concerns about the sustainability of 
public Þ nances in some euro area countries, in 
part related to the need for Þ nancial support for 
ailing banking systems, but to some extent also 

pointing to uncertainty about 
various aspects 
of European sovereign crisis prevention and resolution mechanisms. Once again, yields on some government bonds rose sharply. 
The concurrent deterioration in the funding 
conditions of a number of banks led to an 
increase in recourse to the liquidity supplied by 
the Eurosystem. The tensions in some segments of the Þ nancial markets, and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy, created additional downside 
risks to the economic outlook reported in the 
December 2010 Eurosystem staff projections, 
which was largely unchanged from the outlook 
for 2010 and 2011 reported in the September 
2010 ECB staff projections. In the view of 
the Governing Council, risks to the economic 
outlook were tilted to the downside, with 
uncertainty remaining elevated. In addition to the 
Þ nancial market tensions, downside risks related 
to renewed increases in oil and other commodity 
prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility 
of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. 
On the other hand, global trade could grow 
more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting 
euro area exports. At the same time, the level 
of business conÞ dence in the euro area remained 
relatively high. As regards price developments, the December 2010 Eurosystem staff projections 
foresaw annual HICP inß ation in a range 
between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2011. Risks to the 
outlook for price stability were seen by the 
Governing Council as being broadly balanced, 
with higher increases in prices expected in the 
months ahead. Upside risks related, in particular, 
to developments in energy and non-energy 
commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices could 
be greater than expected, owing to the need for 
Þ scal consolidation in the coming years. 
Against this background, the Governing 
Council decided in early September and early 
December 2010 to continue to conduct the main 
reÞ nancing operations and the special-term
reÞ nancing operations with a maturity of 
one maintenance period as Þ xed rate tender 
procedures with full allotment in the quarter 
ahead. As a result, the modalities of these 
reÞ nancing operations remained the same 
as those applied in May 2010. Furthermore, 
the Governing Council decided in the 
same meetings to conduct the three-month 
longer-term reÞ nancing operations allotted in 
the last quarter of 2010 and the Þ rst quarter 
of 2011 as Þ xed rate tender procedures with 
full allotment. The rates in these operations 
were Þ xed at the average of the rates on the 
main reÞ nancing operations over the life of the 
respective operation. At the beginning of 2011 inß ation rates 
continued to 
rise, mainly reß ecting higher 
commodity prices. In March 2011 the Governing Council concluded on the basis of the 
economic analysis that risks to the outlook for 
price developments were on the upside, while 
the underlying pace of monetary expansion 
remained moderate. The underlying momentum 
of economic activity in the euro area remained 
positive, but uncertainty remained elevated. 
Strong vigilance was warranted with a view 
to containing upside risks to price stability. It 
was considered essential that the recent rise in 
inß ation should not give rise to broad-based 
inß ationary pressures over the medium term, 
and the Governing Council remained prepared 
to act in a Þ rm and timely manner to ensure that 
upside risks to price stability over the medium 
term would not materialise. The continued 
Þ rm anchoring of in
ß ation expectations was 
considered to be of the essence. The Governing Council also decided to continue conducting the main reÞ nancing operations as 
Þ xed rate tender procedures with full allotment, 23ECBAnnual Report
2010for as long as necessary, and at least until 12 July 2011. This procedure also remained in 
use for the special-term reÞ nancing operations, 
which would continue to be conducted for 
as long as needed, and at least until the end 
of the second quarter of 2011. Furthermore, 
the Governing Council decided to continue 
conducting the three-month longer-term 
reÞ nancing operations allotted in the second 
quarter of 2011 as Þ xed rate tender procedures 
with full allotment.24ECBAnnual Report
20102.1 THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT 
GLOBAL RECOVERY CONTINUED IN 2010In 2010 global economic activity continued to recover from the severe recession recorded 
during the global Þ nancial crisis. Particularly in the Þ rst half of the year, the economic upturn was 
sustained by monetary and Þ scal policy stimulus 
measures, some further normalisation of global 
Þ nancing conditions and improvements in 
consumer and business conÞ dence. In addition, 
a prolonged inventory cycle supported the global 
economic recovery, as Þ rms rebuilt their stocks in 
response to a more favourable global economic 
outlook. In fact, the restocking contributed 
signiÞ cantly to GDP growth in major economies 
over this period. Accordingly, the global 
composite Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) 
continued to recover in early 2010 and reached 
a peak of 57.7 in April, which was above the 
levels prevailing just before the intensiÞ cation of 
the global economic crisis after the collapse of 
Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The overall 
improvement in the economic situation and 
the rebound in activity Œ which was led by the 
manufacturing sector Œ was accompanied by 
a strong recovery in world trade, as reß ected in very buoyant export and import growth 
rates, particularly in the Þ rst half of the year. 
However, the pace of the recovery was rather 
uneven across regions. In advanced economies, 
the upturn remained fairly modest. At the same 
time, emerging economies, particularly in Asia, 
led the global recovery, even raising concerns 
about overheating pressures in several countries. 
Global employment indicators also gradually 
improved in the course of the year, following 
widespread job losses throughout the preceding 
two years.In the second half of the year the global recovery temporarily lost some momentum 
(see the top panel of Chart 3) in the light of 
waning support from the global inventory cycle 
and the retrenchment of Þ scal stimuli, but the 
recovery seemed to have moved onto a more 
self-sustained trajectory. Several countries also 
announced consolidation measures to address the precarious Þ scal situation. The process of 
balance sheet adjustment in various sectors 
and subdued labour market developments, 
particularly in advanced economies, further 
dampened the recovery of the world economy. 
Correspondingly, global trade dynamics 
also slowed down in the second half of 2010, 2 MONETARY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC

2010expanding at a slower pace than in the Þ rst six months. However, available information suggests that the growth momentum 
picked up again at the turn of the year. In spite of a gradual increase in commodity 
prices, mostly in the second half of the year, 

inß ationary pressures in advanced economies 
remained subdued in 2010 (see the bottom panel 

of Chart 3) Œ with some notable exceptions, 

such as the United Kingdom Œ on account of 

well-anchored inß ation expectations and the 
prevailing spare capacity. This contrasted with 

dynamic emerging markets where inß ationary 
pressures were more pronounced, partly on 

account of higher commodity prices, as well 

as rising capacity constraints. Amid persisting 

concerns regarding inß ation resulting from 
overheating, several central banks in emerging 

economies decided to withdraw some of the 

exceptional liquidity measures introduced in 

response to the crisis and to tighten their monetary 

policy stances. According to the latest available 

data, headline annual consumer price inß ation in 
the OECD area declined gradually during 2010, 

from a peak of just above 2% in January 2010 

to 1.6% in August, before edging up again to stand 

at 2.1% in December. This is also consistent with 

developments in the PMI for input prices, which 

also increased in the second half of 2010 and in 

January 2011 stood at the highest level in almost 

two and a half years. Higher food and energy 

prices contributed to this increase. Excluding 

food and energy, annual consumer price inß ation 
in the OECD area declined throughout the year, 

from 1.6% at the beginning of 2010 to 1.2% in 

December. 
UNITED STATESIn the United States, the economy continued 
to recover in 2010. A modest cyclical upswing 
gained traction, with the support of substantial 
macroeconomic policy stimuli and a gradual 
improvement in Þ nancial conditions. Real 
GDP expanded at a rate of 2.8%, following 
a 2.6% contraction in 2009. The recovery 
in private domestic demand was slow by 
historical standards, reß ecting subdued growth 
in consumer spending. Household consumption remained constrained by high unemployment, 
low conÞ dence and continuing efforts to 
repair stretched balance sheets. A strong 
rebound in business investment in equipment 
and software was an important driver of the 
recovery, underpinned by improving access to 
credit, as well as solid corporate proÞ tability against the background of cost-cutting measures 
implemented during the downturn. Growth 
was also supported by temporary factors such 
as government policies enacted to foster the 
economic recovery and the restocking of 
inventories. In net terms, trade subtracted from 
GDP growth in 2010 as the rebound in imports 
outpaced that in exports. Having contracted 
sharply during the recession, the current account 
deÞ cit widened modestly with the onset of the 
recovery and averaged 3.3% of GDP in the Þ rst three quarters of 2010, up from 2.7% in 2009. 
The housing sector failed to improve: after 
tentatively increasing in the Þ rst half of the year, 
housing activity and prices weakened again in 
the second half following the expiration of some 
housing support initiatives. In the context of a modest economic recovery, price developments remained subdued as 
upward cost pressures were limited by the 
persistent slack in product and labour markets. 
The annual change in the CPI for 2010 rose 
to 1.6%, from -0.4% the year before, on account 
of rising energy costs. Excluding food and 
energy, CPI inß ation continued to slow and 
averaged 1.0% for the whole year, down from 
1.7% in 2009. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve System kept its target for 
the federal funds rate unchanged within a range 
of 0% to 0.25% throughout 2010 and continued 
to anticipate that economic conditions would 
be likely to warrant exceptionally low levels 
for the federal funds rate for an extended 
period. Although the special liquidity facilities 
created to support markets during the crisis 
were closed and the large-scale purchases of 
mortgage-related assets were concluded by 
mid-2010, in August 2010 the FOMC decided 
to maintain the Federal Reserve™s holdings of 26ECBAnnual Report
2010securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency 

mortgage-backed securities in longer-term 
Treasury securities. It also decided to continue 
to roll over the Federal Reserve™s holdings 
of Treasury securities as they mature. Later, 
in November 2010 the FOMC announced its 
intention to purchase a further USD 600 billion 
of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of 
the second quarter of 2011 in order to promote a 
stronger pace of economic recovery.As regards Þ scal policy, the federal budget de
Þ cit narrowed slightly to 8.9% of GDP in the 2010 Þ scal year Œ which ended in September 2010 Œ 
compared with 10% in the previous year. 
This led to a further increase in the federal 
debt held by the public to 62% at the end of 
the 2010 Þ scal year, from 53% in the previous 
Þ scal year. In the context of high de
Þ cits, rising federal debt and the further enactment 
of Þ scal stimuli (totalling USD 858 billion) in 
the short term, a report by the President™s Fiscal 
Commission was issued in December 2010 
with concrete proposals on how to address 
medium-term Þ scal challenges and achieve 
Þ scal sustainability over the long run. 
CANADAEconomic activity in Canada picked up rapidly 

in early 2010, after emerging from the recession 

in mid-2009, supported by solid domestic 

demand, macroeconomic stimuli and a rebound 

in exports. By the third quarter of 2010, however, 

the recovery had lost momentum owing to a 

slowdown in construction activity, coupled with a 

negative net trade contribution to growth. Labour 

market conditions were relatively favourable, as 

they continued to improve gradually in parallel 

with the evolving economic upturn. However, 

despite declining to 7.6% in December 2010 

(the lowest level since January 2009), 

the unemployment rate remained well above 

its pre-recession levels. Economic activity 

continued to be supported by a low interest rate 

environment (despite the Bank of Canada having 

taken steps towards a tighter policy stance from 

mid-2010), stable Þ nancial market conditions 
and a resilient banking system, which allowed 
for a continued ß ow of credit to businesses and 
households. Turning to price developments, 

headline and core CPI inß ation stayed within the 
central bank™s target inß ation range of 1% to 3%. 
Annual headline CPI inß ation trended upwards 
in the second half of 2010 and stood at 2.4% in 

December, reß ecting the impact of higher energy 
and food prices, while core inß ation was 1.5% in 
December, following a gentle deceleration in the 

course of 2010.JAPANIn Japan, the economic recovery continued 
during the Þ rst three quarters of 2010, supported 
by the implementation of accommodative 
monetary policy and a substantial Þ scal stimulus. The improvement in the economic 
situation in Japan was also aided by strong 
global demand, in particular from the Asian 
emerging economies, especially in the Þ rst half of 2010. In the second half of the year 
the contribution from the external sector 
declined, owing to the moderation of world 
trade growth, while domestic spending remained 
Þ rm. However, towards the end of the year, 
as a result of volatility in domestic spending 
following the withdrawal of the government 
stimulus, the economic recovery in Japan hit 
a soft patch, resulting in a deterioration in 
business sentiment. Labour market conditions 
improved somewhat over 2010, although the 
unemployment rate remained rather high by 
historical standards. As regards price developments, consumer prices fell throughout most of 2010 on a year-on-year 
basis, owing to substantial slack in the economy. 
In October, however, annual CPI inß ation turned 
positive for the Þ rst time in almost two years, 
driven partly by an increase in tax on cigarettes 
and higher commodity prices, while annual CPI 
inß ation excluding food and energy, although 
moderating, continued its deß ationary trend.
Throughout 2010 the Bank of Japan maintained 
an accommodative monetary stance in order 
to stimulate the economy and Þ ght de
ß ation, lowering its uncollateralised overnight call 
rate to between 0% and 0.1% in October 2010 27ECBAnnual Report
2010and establishing other measures such as a new asset purchase programme, as well as extending 
the Þ xed rate fund-supplying operation. On 
15 September 2010 the Japanese authorities 
intervened in the foreign exchange market for 
the Þ rst time since March 2004 in order to curb 
the appreciation of the yen.EMERGING ASIAEmerging Asia™s resilience to the global 
economic and Þ nancial crisis was demonstrated 
by very strong economic performance across 
the region in 2010, with an area-wide GDP 
growth rate of 9.1%. While supportive Þ scal and 
monetary policies were gradually withdrawn 
and the contribution of net exports declined in 
the second half of the year, domestic private 
demand and, notably, gross Þ xed investment 
took over as the main drivers of economic 
growth, especially in India and Indonesia. 
Overall economic performance remained robust 
in the second half of 2010, although the pace of 
expansion slowed down somewhat compared 
with the previous six months. After recording very low consumer price inß ation rates in 2009, in
ß ationary pressures 
increased markedly during 2010. Annual 
CPI inß ation for the region stood at 5% in 
December 2010, mainly on account of rising 
food and commodity prices. Most central banks 
in the region started to tighten their monetary 
stances in the second half of 2010, reducing the 
monetary stimuli introduced in the previous year. 
Given emerging Asia™s strong macroeconomic 
performance and the declining risk aversion 
of international investors, the region also 
experienced a major rebound in capital 
inß ows. A number of countries intervened in 
currency markets to stem the ensuing currency 
appreciation pressures, and also introduced 
capital controls and macro-prudential measures.In China, real GDP growth accelerated to 10.3% in 2010, from 9.2% in 2009. The vigorous 
economic performance reß ected increasing 
contributions from private investment and net 
exports, which counterbalanced the negative 
impact of the gradual withdrawal of policy stimuli. However, the relative contribution 
of consumption to growth decreased and the 
current account surplus widened in nominal 
terms in 2010, evidence of the persistence of 
internal and external imbalances. Inß ationary pressures increased during the year, with CPI 
inß ation reaching 4.6% in annual terms in 
December, mainly on account of rising food 
prices. Property price pressures emerged against 
the background of ample liquidity, ongoing 
loose credit conditions and negative real interest 
rates on deposits. The authorities reacted by 
tightening their policy stance in the second part 
of the year. Among other things, this resulted in 
stricter quantitative limits on credit and increases 
in lending and deposit rates. Larger capital 
inß ows, particularly in the last quarter of 2010, 
fuelled a rapid increase in foreign exchange 
reserves, which reached USD 2.85 trillion 
by the end of 2010. On 19 June 2010 China 
returned to a more ß exible exchange rate 
arrangement for the renminbi, which appreciated 
by 3.6% against the US dollar and by 4.7% in 
real effective terms (CPI-deß ated) in 2010.
LATIN AMERICAIn Latin America, economic activity continued 

to recover rapidly in 2010. GDP growth was 

particularly robust in the Þ rst half of the year, 
mainly owing to buoyant domestic demand 

which more than offset the outstanding 

negative contribution of external demand (about 

3 percentage points in the third quarter) to GDP 

growth. Thereafter, the growth momentum slowed 

down somewhat as policy stimulus measures 

were withdrawn and foreign demand weakened. 

In year-on-year terms, real GDP for the region as 

a whole increased by 6.0% on average in the Þ rst 
three quarters of 2010. Gross capital formation, 

including inventory accumulation, and private 

consumption were the main drivers of regional 

growth. Investment was spurred on by the 

improved growth outlook, the rise in commodity 

prices, the decline in real interest rates and the 

greater availability of Þ nancing, which, in some 
countries, was enhanced by lending by public 

banks. Private consumption growth was sustained 

by a rapid recovery in conÞ dence, as well as 
employment and real wages. 
28ECBAnnual Report
2010In early 2010, notwithstanding sizeable 
differences across countries, inß ation in 
most of the countries with inß ation-targeting 
arrangements moved signiÞ cantly closer to the 
respective target value. However, in the context 

of strong growth in economic activity and rising 

commodity prices, inß ationary pressures started 
to rise later in the year and some countries 

began to reverse part of the monetary stimuli 

deployed during the crisis. From April onwards 

several central banks in the region initiated a 

cycle of ofÞ cial interest rate rises. As global 
Þ nancial conditions continued to improve and 
risk appetite returned, spreads on credit default 

swaps on Latin American sovereign debt 

narrowed, stock prices increased signiÞ cantly 
and Þ nancial ß ows returned, resulting in 
currency appreciations. In late 2010, given that 

higher interest rates would risk fuelling strong 

capital inß ows and owing to uncertainty relating 
to global economic developments, the process 

of tightening policy rates was interrupted in 

some countries and a number of measures to 

stem large capital inß ows were introduced 
(e.g. reserve accumulation, macro-prudential 

policies and capital controls). 
COMMODITY PRICES INCREASED IN 2010After having remained broadly stable amid some 
volatility in the Þ rst half of 2010, oil prices 
began to increase steadily in August, with the 
Brent crude oil price standing at USD 113 per 
barrel on 25 February 2011, compared with 
USD 78 per barrel at the beginning of 2010. 
In US dollar terms, the level reached at the end 
of February 2011 was broadly similar to that 
recorded in May 2008. For the year 2010 as a 
whole, the average price of Brent crude oil was 
USD 80 per barrel, i.e. 29% above the average 
of the previous year. The oil price increases came against the background of a recovery in global oil demand, 
which strengthened throughout the year, 
and was supported by the global economic 
recovery, as well as by weather conditions in 
the northern hemisphere in the second part of 
the year. This growth in demand also led to 
a reassessment of future demand prospects, which looked much more robust than one year 
earlier and suggested that the market might 
tighten in the future. One indication of this 
was the stream of repeated upward revisions of 
demand projections by the International Energy 
Agency, both for emerging and developed 
economies. On the supply side, the output in 
North America and in former Soviet Union 
countries proved to be higher than foreseen, but 
on the other hand, OPEC decided not to raise 
its production quotas in 2010, despite its ample 
spare capacity. In the context of buoyant demand, 

this led to a substantial drawdown in OECD 
inventories, which nevertheless remained 
at high levels by historical standards. In the 
Þ rst two months of 2011 geopolitical events in 
North Africa and the Middle East further 
tightened the supply side of the market, thereby 
accelerating the increase in prices.The prices of non-energy commodities also increased in 2010 (see Chart 4), amid robust 
demand from emerging economies and supply 
constraints. Metal prices Œ in particular copper, 
nickel and tin Œ posted signiÞ cant gains, which 
were also sustained by buoyant imports by Chart 4 Main developments in commodity

in particular by maize, sugar and wheat. 
In aggregate terms, non-energy commodity 
prices (denominated in US dollars) were about 
36% higher towards the end of February 2011 
compared with the beginning of 2010.2.2 MONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
MONETARY GROWTH SHOWED SIGNS 
OF A TENTATIVE RECOVERYThe annual growth rate of headline M3 turned 
positive during 2010, standing at 1.7% in 
December 2010, compared with -0.3% at the end 
of 2009. This development implies a recovery 
in monetary dynamics, although uncertainty 
regarding its strength increased towards the end 
of 2010, as growth was affected by certain 
special factors (asset transfers to ﬁbad banksﬂ 2 and repo activity owing to interbank transactions 
conducted via central counterparties). Overall, 
monetary developments in 2010 were largely driven by three economic factors: the upward 
impact of both the pick-up in economic activity 
and the diminishing downward effect of the 
yield curve (with  no further large-scale 
reallocation of funds from instruments within 
M3 to Þ nancial assets outside M3); and 
the downward impact of a dampening 
effect stemming from the unwinding of 
previously accumulated monetary liquidity. 
On the counterpart side, the annual growth rate 
of MFI loans to the private sector increased 
during 2010, reaching 1.9% in December 2010, 
up from -0.2% at the end of the previous year 
(see Chart 5). The subdued nature of the 
expansion in loans to the private sector reß ected the stabilisation of the annual growth rate of 
loans to households and a slight strengthening 
of the annual growth rate of loans to 
non-Þ nancial corporations. The broadly parallel 
increases in the growth of M3 and loans imply 
that the decline in underlying monetary growth, 
which captures the monetary trends providing 
the relevant signal as regards risks to price 
stability, tapered off in 2010, giving way to a 
moderate recovery. THE IMPACT OF THE STEEP YIELD CURVE 

WEAKENEDDevelopments in the interest rate constellation 

affected not only shifts between assets included 

in M3 and those outside M3, but also shifts 

within M3. The gradual increase observed in the 

annual growth rate of M3 concealed strongly 

divergent trends in the annual growth rates 

of its components (see Chart 6). The annual 

growth rate of M1 declined signiÞ cantly 
in 2010, but remained at robustly positive 

levels (standing at 4.4% in December), while 

that of marketable instruments and short-term 

deposits other than overnight deposits (i.e. M3 

minus M1) became noticeably less negative 

(standing at -1.5% in December). As a result, 
In the broadest sense, ﬁbad banksﬂ are dedicated schemes set up 2 and backed by governments to facilitate the removal from credit institutions™ balance sheets of assets that are at risk of severe 
impairment or are difÞ cult to value.

2010the gap between these growth rates narrowed 
signiÞ cantly to stand at 6.1 percentage points in 
December, down from 22.0 percentage points at 

the end of 2009. This largely reß ected interest 
rate developments (see Chart 7). The interest 

rate on overnight deposits remained broadly 

stable in 2010, while the remuneration of 

deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two 

years increased noticeably and the interest 

rate on deposits redeemable at notice of up 

to three months increased marginally. As a 

result, the opportunity cost of holding the 

most liquid deposit contained in M3 increased 

and the rebalancing within M3 in favour 

of such deposits waned. The impact of the 

steep yield curve weakened in 2010, halting 

large-scale shifts into Þ nancial assets outside 
M3, which had mainly come at the expense 

of marketable instruments and short-term
deposits other than overnight deposits. 

Consequently, the annual growth rates of 

these assets became less negative. The annual 

growth rate of marketable instruments was also 

boosted by increased repo activity, especially 
towards the end of the year, which largely 

reß ected interbank transactions conducted via 
central counterparties (which are classiÞ ed as 
non-monetary Þ nancial intermediaries other 
than insurance corporations and pension funds 

(referred to as ﬁOFIsﬂ)). 
TRENDS IN SECTORAL MONEY HOLDINGS 

REMAINED DIVERGENTThe broadest aggregation of M3 components 
for which sectoral information is reported is 
short-term deposits and repurchase agreements 
(hereafter referred to as ﬁM3 depositsﬂ). 
The turnaround observed in the annual growth 
rate of M3 deposits in 2010 largely reß ected a particularly strong contribution by OFIs. 
The annual growth rate of OFIs™ holdings of 
M3 deposits increased signiÞ cantly to stand at 
10.8% in December, compared with -3.1% at 
the end of 2009. This increase largely reß ected strong interbank repo transactions in the second 
and fourth quarters, as well as increasingly 
strong inß ows for overnight deposits in the Þ rst three quarters of the year. Chart 6 Main components of M3(annual percentage changes; adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects)-15-10-50

2010By contrast with OFIs, the annual growth rate of households™ M3 deposits declined marginally 
to stand at 1.9% in December, down from 2.0% 
at the end of 2009 (see Chart 8). This masked a 
decrease in the Þ rst half of 2010 and a recovery in the second half of the year. Developments 
in households™ M3 holdings in 2010 largely 
reß ected interest rate developments. The decline 
observed in the annual growth rate in the Þ rst half of 2010 reß ected more muted in
ß ows for overnight deposits as the impact of the 
steep yield curve waned. The slight recovery 
observed in the second half of the year reß ected a signiÞ cant decline in out
ß ows for deposits 
with an agreed maturity of up to two years as 
the spread between the remuneration of these 
deposits and that of short-term savings deposits 
and other deposits outside M3 decreased.The annual growth rate of the M3 deposits of non-Þ nancial corporations also declined 
in 2010. It exhibited some volatility in the 
Þ rst half of the year, while declining overall, 
before increasing only slightly in the second half. It stood at 4.4% in December, down from 
5.4% in December 2009. Developments in 
non-Þ nancial corporations™ holdings of M3 
reß ected the pick-up in economic activity, and 
may also have been related to loan developments, 
as Þ rms may have used their deposits to reduce 
their debt or as a substitute for bank credit in the 
Þ rst half of the year. The positive 
ß ow of loans 
in the second half of the year may have enabled 
Þ rms to rebuild their liquidity buffers towards 
the end of the year.GROWTH IN CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR 

INCREASED SLIGHTLYAs regards the counterparts of M3, the annual 
growth rate of MFI credit to euro area residents 
increased slightly in 2010, reaching 3.4% in 
December, up from 2.5% in December 2009 
(see Chart 9). This increase, which primarily 
occurred in the second half of the year, mainly 
reß ected the slight recovery observed in the 
annual growth rate of credit to the private sector.

government ended the year at a level almost the Chart 8 Sectoral deposits(annual percentage changes; not adjusted for seasonal or calendar effects)-10-50510

2010same as that recorded at the end of 2009, despite declining for most of 2010. This decline 
reß ected MFIs scaling back their purchases of 
government securities, in the absence of any 
further steepening of the yield curve and in light 
of market tensions. This trend was reversed in 
the fourth quarter of the year, when credit to 
general government increased sharply as a 
consequence of MFI assets being transferred to 
ﬁbad banksﬂ.3 The slight recovery in the growth of credit to 
the private sector mainly reß ected the slow but 
steady strengthening observed in the annual 
growth rate of loans. By contrast, the annual 
growth rate of MFIs™ holdings of private sector 
securities other than shares declined further in 
the Þ rst half of 2010 owing to the lower level of 
securitisation activity. Such activity recovered 
slightly in the second half of the year, partially 
reß ecting asset transfers between MFIs and 
ﬁbad banksﬂ, contributing to the stabilisation of 
MFIs™ holdings of private sector securities other 
than shares.The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector, the largest component of credit 
to the private sector, increased gradually from 
the marginally negative rate recorded at the end 
of 2009 to stand at 1.9% in December 2010 
(see Chart 5). This would be consistent with a 
modest recovery in loan demand and would 
also be supported by available evidence on the 
evolution of credit standards. In this respect, 
the euro area bank lending survey suggests that 
supply-side inß uences weakened in the course 
of the year. Given the low level of securitisation 
activity, the difference between the headline 
annual growth rate of loans to the private 
sector and the growth rate adjusted for the 
derecognition of loans from MFI balance sheets 
was modest in 2010.At the sectoral level, the recovery in the annual growth rate of loans to the private 
sector is attributable primarily to lending to the 
non-Þ nancial private sector Œ i.e. households and 
non-Þ nancial corporations. In December 2010 
the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 2.9% (up from 1.3% at the end 
of 2009), compared with -0.2% for lending to 
non-Þ nancial corporations (up from -2.2% in 
December 2009). The annual growth rate of 
loans to OFIs increased progressively in the 
second half of the year, but this development  

was attributable mainly to an increase in 
interbank repurchase agreements traded 
via central counterparties, which result in a 
commensurate increase in MFI loans to these 
Þ nancial intermediaries. 
The recovery in private sector loan growth 
in the Þ rst half of the year was accounted for 
mainly by developments in loans to households, 
which were driven almost entirely by a recovery 
in loans for house purchase. This coincided with 
an upturn in the annual growth rate of euro area 
residential property prices. The continuation of 
the recovery in loans to the non-Þ nancial private 
sector in the second half of the year was due 
mainly to the turnaround observed in the annual 
growth of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations 
(albeit the growth rate remained negative). 
Adjusting for the derecognition of loans from 
MFIs™ balance sheets Œ which largely reß ected transfers to ﬁbad banksﬂ Œ the annual growth 
rate of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations would 
have turned positive in 2010. Overall, developments in loans to the 
non-Þ nancial private sector in 2010 remained 
broadly consistent with business cycle 

regularities. The turning point in the growth of 

loans to households typically takes place early 

in the economic cycle, while that of loans to 

non-Þ nancial corporations tends to lag behind 
it. Quarterly data on the annual growth rate of 

loans to non-Þ nancial corporations indicate that 
its turning point occurred in the second quarter 

of 2010, following that of loans to households 

one year earlier. In line with previous episodes, 

the improvement seen in lending to non-Þ nancial 
corporations in 2010 is likely to have been related 

to the growth observed in corporate investment and

2010spending needs in the context of improving 
business expectations and the pick-up in 

economic activity. It may well also reß ect 
changes in the relative attractiveness of market 

Þ nancing, as corporate yields have partly been 
affected by the rise in yields associated with 

the sovereign debt crisis. At the same time, loan 

dynamics varied across euro area countries, 

possibly reß ecting uneven economic recoveries 
across countries and economic sectors of the 
euro area, as well as differences in the extent 

to which individual sectors need and have 

recourse to bank loans, rather than Þ nancing 
themselves via internally generated funds and/or 

market-based funding. (See Box 2 for a 

comparison of recent developments in the 

annual growth rate of loans to the non-Þ nancial 
private sector and its main components with 

their behaviour during two previous periods of 

economic decline and recovery.)Box 2COMPARING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN MFI LOANS TO THE NON-FINANCIAL PRIVATE SECTOR 

WITH PREVIOUS EPISODES OF ECONOMIC DECLINE AND RECOVERYThe magnitude and nature of the economic downturn that followed the Þ nancial crisis made it 
likely that developments in MFI loans would be exceptional. Against this background, this box 

compares recent developments in the annual growth rate of loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector 
and its main components with their behaviour during two previous episodes of economic decline 

and recovery: the early 1990s and the early 2000s. In order to allow greater comparability as 

regards the magnitude of these developments, 

this box focuses on real MFI loans (using the 

GDP deß ator).Developments in total loans to the 
non-Þ nancial private sector
The annual growth rate of real loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector fell by around
 9 percentage points (from peak to trough) 
during the recent recession, ending up 

in negative territory. This decline was 

considerably stronger than those experienced 

during the economic downturns of the early 

1990s and early 2000s, when the annual 

growth rate fell between 6 and 7 percentage 

points and remained in positive territory 

(see Chart A). Moreover, the bulk of the 

recent decline occurred in a relatively short 

period of time (six quarters), compared with 

more drawn-out declines in the past (sixteen 

quarters in the early 1990s and nine quarters 

in the early 2000s). However, neither the 

magnitude nor the speed of the latest decline 

appear excessive given the severity of the

2010recent recession. The annual growth rate of 
real GDP declined by almost 9 percentage 

points in the space of a year during the 

recent economic downturn, compared with 

6 percentage points over four years in the early 

1990s and 4 percentage points over almost 

two years in the early 2000s (see Chart B). 
The fact that the annual growth rate of loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector 
declined to negative levels is unusual, but 
not unprecedented for euro area countries. 
In the recession of the early 1990s, loans 
to the non-Þ nancial private sector were 
boosted by signiÞ cant growth in loans to 
German households following reuniÞ cation. Excluding the German non-Þ nancial private 
sector, the annual growth rate of real loans to 
the non-Þ nancial private sector declined by 
13 percentage points, falling to a level more 
negative than that observed during the recent 
recession (see Chart A). The turning point in the annual growth rate of 
real loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector 
occurred in the third quarter of 2009, in line with 

cyclical regularities.1 In the case of both the recent 
recession and that of the early 2000s, the recovery 

in loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector came 
two quarters after a turning point in real GDP 

growth, while the recovery in the early 1990s 

lagged the turning point in real GDP by three 

quarters. 
Developments in loans to householdsCompared with previous episodes of weak 

economic activity, developments in loans to 
households played a more prominent role in shaping the overall evolution of loans to the 

non-Þ nancial private sector during the recent 
recession and recovery. The peak-to-trough 

decline in the annual growth rate of real loans to 

households was more pronounced in the recent 

recession and the annual growth rate fell to 

negative levels, reß ecting the greater severity of

2010the slowdown in the housing market (see Chart C). The turning point in the annual growth rate of real 
loans to households occurred in the third quarter of 2009, two quarters after the recovery in the annual 

growth rate of real GDP. This was somewhat later than in the other two periods considered and is not 

in line with the relationship typically observed between real loans to households and real GDP.However, a relatively late turning point in the annual growth rate of real loans to households is not unprecedented. In the early 1990s, a clear turning point in the annual growth rate of real 
loans to non-German euro area households was not seen until three quarters after the recovery 
in the annual growth rate of real GDP. That period was also characterised by declining house 
prices, following signiÞ cant booms in a number of euro area countries, indicating that the 
delayed recoveries may, in both cases, reß ect some rebalancing of balance sheets on the part of households and banks. In each of the periods considered, the recovery in the annual growth rate    

of real loans to households was driven by loans for house purchase. Developments in loans to non-Þ nancial corporations
The overall trend in the annual growth rate of loans to non-Þ nancial corporations during the
 recent episode was broadly similar to those of previous episodes (see Chart D). However, the 
magnitude of the decline was more severe, as 

the annual growth rate of loans to non-Þ nancial 
corporations fell by 15 percentage points from 

peak to trough, compared with declines of 

10 percentage points and 12 percentage points 

in the early 1990s and early 2000s respectively. 

The signiÞ cant decline in real lending to 
non-Þ nancial corporations during the recent 
recession reß ects the substantial decline 
observed in economic activity, particularly in 

the construction and real estate sectors, as well 

as increased recourse to market-based sources 

of Þ nancing.2 These sectors are relatively 
loan-intensive and had been a key driver of 

lending to euro area non-Þ nancial corporations 
owing to strong housing booms in various euro 

area countries in recent years.The turning point in the annual growth rate of real loans to non-Þ nancial corporations 
occurred in early 2010, four quarters after 
the recovery in the annual growth rate of real 
GDP. This is broadly in line with historical 
regularities, albeit slightly later than in the 
two previous episodes considered. Although 
the annual growth rate of real loans to 
non-Þ nancial corporations remained slightly

2010Of the other counterparts of M3, the annual 
growth rate of MFI longer-term Þ nancial liabilities 
(excluding capital and reserves) held by the
money-holding sector declined noticeably in the 

course of the year to stand at 3.0% in December, 

down from 6.0% at the end of 2009. This was 

visible mainly for longer-term deposits (i.e. both 

deposits redeemable at notice of over three months 

and deposits with an agreed maturity of over two 

years), but also for longer-term MFI debt securities 

(i.e. those with a maturity of over two years). 

The deceleration observed for longer-term deposits 

is likely to have reß ected the fact that their 
remuneration became less attractive as a result 

of the slight ß attening of the yield curve in the 
course of the year, while that seen for longer-term 

securities may have been related to the perception 

of a higher level of risk for MFI securities. 
Finally, the net external position of euro area MFIs 
recorded a further decline in 2010, decreasing by 

•89 billion. This was the result of a negative ß ow 
for external assets, which exceeded the decline 

observed in external liabilities. On balance, this 

means that the money-holding sector™s interaction 

with the rest of the world via euro area MFIs 

resulted in a net capital inß ow. 
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVED 

DESPITE SOME VOLATILITY 
In 2010 the behaviour of euro area money 
market interest rates was affected by various factors. Overall, the Eurosystem continued to 
provide extraordinary liquidity support to euro 
area banks. Given the improvements observed 
in Þ nancial market conditions in the course 
of 2009, the Eurosystem began, in early 2010, 
to gradually phase out those non-standard 
monetary policy measures that were no longer 
deemed necessary, with the average maturity of 
liquidity-providing operations being shortened 
as a result. However, the sovereign debt crisis in 
May caused severe tensions in the government 
bond markets of some euro area countries, with 
adverse effects on the transmission mechanism  

for monetary policy, as reß ected in higher levels 
of perceived liquidity and credit risk. With 
the aim of addressing the malfunctioning of 
securities markets and restoring an appropriate 
transmission mechanism for monetary policy, 
the Eurosystem launched the Securities Markets 
Programme and reactivated some of the non-
standard measures that it had previously phased 
out. Box 1 describes the non-standard measures 
employed in 2010, which were essential in 
limiting contagion as regards money market 
rates. In the second half of 2010 the automatic 
phasing-out of non-standard measures via the 
expiry of six-month and one-year longer-term 
reÞ nancing operations led to lower levels of 
excess liquidity and higher money market rates. Secured and unsecured money market interest rates declined somewhat across all maturities negative at the end of 2010, its recovery was faster and stronger than in the early 1990s. As in 
previous periods, the upturn in loan dynamics was driven by a noticeable improvement in the 
annual growth rate of short-term loans.ConclusionThe magnitude of the recent decline in the annual growth rate of loans to the non-Þ nancial private 
sector was substantial in absolute terms. However, it is consistent with past economic downturns when relative declines in real GDP are considered. Developments in the annual growth rate of 
real loans to households were slightly unusual, with that growth rate declining relatively strongly 
to stand at negative levels and its turning point lagging the recovery in the annual growth rate 
of real GDP. Both of these aspects are likely to reß ect the speciÞ c role of the housing market in 
the recent recession. Overall, developments in real MFI loans to the non-Þ nancial private sector 
were broadly in line with behaviour observed during previous periods of economic decline and 
recovery.37ECBAnnual Report
2010in the Þ rst quarter of 2010, before increasing 
substantially over the remainder of the year. More speciÞ cally, looking at three-month 
unsecured rates, the three-month EURIBOR 
stood close to 0.70% at the beginning of 
January 2010, declined to 0.63% at the end 
of March, and then increased to 1.09% on 
25 February 2011 (see Chart 10). As regards 
the secured segment of the money market, the 
three-month EUREPO stood at around 0.40% 
at the beginning of January 2010, before 
decreasing slightly in the Þ rst quarter of the year 
to stand at 0.34% at the end of March. It then 
increased strongly to peak at 0.80% in early 
November, before declining to around 0.56% in 
early January 2011, and it then increased again 
to stand at 0.81% on 25 February. As a result of these developments, volatility was observed throughout the year in the 
spread between secured and unsecured money 
market rates, which stood somewhat lower on 
25 February 2011 than at the beginning of January 2010. However, it remained relatively 
high by historical standards. Over the course 
of 2010 and early 2011 the spread between 
the three-month EURIBOR and the three-
month EUREPO ß uctuated between 23 and 
46 basis points, starting 2010 at around 30 basis 
points and standing at 28 basis points on 
25 February 2011 (see Chart 10). Looking at very short-term money market rates, developments in the EONIA in 2010 largely 
reß ect the fact that the Eurosystem continued the 
generous liquidity support provided to euro area 
banks since October 2008. With few exceptions, 
the EONIA remained, in the presence of 
substantial excess liquidity, well below the 
Þ xed rate in the Eurosystem™s main re
Þ nancing operations and LTROs and close to the rate on 
the deposit facility (see Chart 11). Towards 
the end of June, as the six-month and one-year 
LTROs matured and banks chose not to fully 
roll over the maturing liquidity, excess liquidity 
declined and the EONIA began to display Chart 11 ECB interest rates and the

2010some volatility. With declining levels of excess liquidity, the EONIA has tended to follow a 
more pronounced pattern within each individual 
maintenance period, standing at higher levels 
at the beginning of the maintenance period, 
before gradually declining towards the end. This 
pattern is strongly related to banks™ preference 
for the fulÞ lment of reserve requirements early 
in the maintenance period, behaviour that 
has been observed since the turmoil began in 
August 2007. This ﬁfrontloadingﬂ had no impact 
on market rates during the 12-month period 
covering the maturity of the Þ rst one-year LTRO 
(i.e. the period from mid-2009 to mid-2010), 
when the liquidity surplus was unprecedented, 
but did affect rates again when excess liquidity 
declined in the second half of 2010. Volatility 
in the EONIA continued into 2011, and on 
25 January the EONIA exceeded the MRO rate 
for the Þ rst time since June 2009. In addition, 
throughout the year occasional spikes were 
observed in the EONIA at the end of maintenance 
periods and at the end of cash management 
periods (e.g. at the end of the year). GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS FACED STRONG 

TENSIONS IN SOME EURO AREA COUNTRIES IN 2010By and large, bond market prices were driven 

by two major developments in 2010. The Þ rst, 
which was speciÞ c to the euro area, started with 
the emergence of turbulence in the sovereign debt 

markets of a number of euro area countries. The 

second, which was far broader in character, was 

to be found in the expected moderation of global 

economic growth in the second half of 2010. 
At the end of 2010, ten-year benchmark bond 
yields in the United States and in the euro 

area (AAA-rated) stood at roughly similar 

levels, ranging between 3.2% and 3.4%. 

Overall, they ended the year approximately 

50 and 40 basis points below the values 

prevailing in the respective economic regions 

at the end of 2009 (see Chart 12). The overall 

decline in yields hides opposing intra-year 

developments, namely a prolonged phase 

of decline until end-August, followed by a 

strong rebound, in particular towards the end 

of the year. Around the end of August, when 
the phase of decline came to a halt, yields had 

fallen approximately 140 and 120 basis points 

respectively below the end-2009 levels. As a 

result of these opposing movements, implied 

bond yield volatility varied considerably 

in the course of 2010, peaking in May and 

September and generally rising from 5% to 

7%, on average, in the two economic areas. 

Notwithstanding this increase, volatility in 

2010 was far lower than the values recorded 

towards the end of 2008 and in the Þ rst half of 
2009, when it had exceeded 10%, on average, 

in both areas. 
It is remarkable that, overall, movements in 
ten-year government bond yields in the course 

of 2010 were generally rather similar in the 

United States and in the euro area, although 

their correlation varied signiÞ cantly. More 
speciÞ cally, the correlation was rather low in 
the Þ rst four months of 2010, as yields were 
broadly stable in the United States, but declined 

in the euro area. In this part of the year, the 

growth of business activity was rather strong in 

both areas, as reß ected, among other things, by 
the fact that equity prices in the United States 

and in the euro area moved virtually in parallel.

2010In the same period, however, AAA-rated euro area government bond yields were being pushed 
downwards by ß ight-to-safety considerations 
that stemmed from the aforementioned 
turbulence on some euro area sovereign debt 
markets, while US yields rose in reß ection of the 
ongoing economic expansion. In the remainder 
of the year, especially as of July, when yields 
converged to similar values in the two economic 
areas and started to move in tandem, the 
correlation increased. In fact, a reassessment 
of the strength of the economic recovery in the 
United States and temporarily lower turbulence 
in the euro area sovereign debt market worked 
towards more synchronous movements in bond 
yields on the two sides of the Atlantic. Near the 
end of the year, however, when global economic 
activity was perceived to be picking up again, as 
signalled by, among other things, an increase in 
the Global PMI in December, US ten-year bond 
yields edged up more rapidly than those in the 
euro area. This development was mirrored in the 
equity markets, with the US equity prices rising 
at a far faster pace, possibly reß ecting market 
concerns that European Þ nancial institutions, in 
particular, could suffer capital losses on account 
of the tensions that were again appearing on the 
euro area sovereign debt market.Turning more speciÞ cally to the movements 
recorded in the course of the year, between approximately mid-November 2009 and early 
April 2010 government bond markets in the 
United States and in the euro area developed 
along somewhat different lines, with yields 
rising by approximately 50 basis points in the 
United States, while those in the euro area 
declined by around 25 points. In this part of 
the year, monetary policy rates on both sides 
of the Atlantic were expected to remain at 
low levels for an extended period of time, 
while macroeconomic releases conÞ rmed that the recovery in growth was robust. Given 
these developments, the opposing movements 
recorded by long-term bond yields in the two 
areas can be explained primarily by intensifying 
market concerns about the sustainability of 
Þ scal positions in some euro area countries, a 
development which generally exerted downward pressure on the yields of the highest-rated euro 
area government bonds. As of the beginning of April government bond yields in the United States started to decline as 
well. The pace of the decline in the US yields in 
this period was rather strong, so that the yield 
differential between the two areas fell from 
some 60 basis points at the end of March to 
around zero at the end of June. While economic 
developments in the euro area continued to 
be favourable and conÞ dence indicators were 
improving overall, AAA-rated long-term 
euro area government yields declined amid 
the intensiÞ cation of the turmoil in European 
sovereign debt markets. The turbulence 
eased somewhat after an EU support package 
for Greece was agreed on the weekend of 
10-11 April, but it increased again in subsequent 
days when the downgrading of the sovereign 
debt of both Greece and Portugal Œ 
to speculative 
grade in the case of the former 
Œ contributed 
to the emergence of a crisis of conÞ dence in 
the sustainability of the Greek Þ scal position. 
The lack of conÞ dence, in turn, fuelled an 
extensive reallocation of funds to AAA-rated
euro area or US government bonds that eventually 

culminated in the large-scale ß ight-to-safety behaviour of investors on 6 and 7 May. It has 
to be noted that the yield on Greek ten-year 
bonds had already risen relative to that of 
corresponding German bonds in the Þ rst quarter of 2010, but yields had generally 
remained stable in the other euro area countries, 
as contagion risk had remained rather subdued. 
The situation changed signiÞ cantly at the 
beginning of April when, looking beyond 
Greece, yields also edged upwards in Ireland 
and Portugal, as well as Œ to a lesser extent Œ in 
Spain, Italy and Belgium. The deterioration in 
the perceived debt sustainability of selected euro 
area countries in this period was well evidenced 
by the spreads on sovereign credit default swaps 
(CDSs), instruments used by investors to protect 
themselves against sovereign default risk. Conditions improved noticeably in the course of May, on account of unprecedented 
measures taken at the EU level. Among these 40ECBAnnual Report
2010were the decisions on the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and the European 
Financial Stability Facility, as well as several 
measures announced by the Eurosystem on 
10 May to restore an appropriate monetary 
policy transmission mechanism, including the 
Securities Markets Programme, which paved the 
way for interventions in private and public debt 
securities markets in the euro area. Additional 
support for the euro area bond market in the 
course of July may also have originated from 
the publication of the results of the EU-wide 
stress tests and related information on banks™ 
sovereign debt exposures. However, tensions 
did not subside completely, as was shown by, 
among other things, a continuing rise in yields 
in a number of euro area countries, despite 
the further decline of German bond yields. 
The latter may have been related not only to 
ß ight-to-safety considerations, but also to 
increasing signs of a slowdown in economic 
activity in the euro area and, particularly, in the 
United States, mainly evidenced by a renewed 
deterioration of the housing and labour markets 
there. The decelerating US business cycle, in 
fact, affected market sentiment in a number of 
other major economies and triggered strong 
capital ß ows into those government bond 
markets that were perceived to be less risky, 
also leading to expectations of a second round 
of quantitative easing measures.In the last quarter of the year yields began to rise on both sides of the Atlantic. The 
generally increasing yields in this period 
were consistent with the return to a more 
benign economic outlook, which was more 
clear-cut in the euro area than in the 
United States, where macroeconomic releases 
were positive overall, but also exhibited a 
great deal of heterogeneity. Compared with 
AAA-rated long-term sovereign debt, the yields 
on the bonds of most lower-rated euro area 
sovereign issuers recorded far sharper increases 
and much higher intra-period volatility in the 
last quarter of the year. Ten-year government 
bond spreads vis-à-vis German bonds rose 
especially markedly in the case of Ireland, namely 

by 280 basis points between the beginning of September and the end of November, as 
market participants focused attention on this 
country on account of their growing concerns 
about the Þ scal burden associated with the Irish 
government™s support for its Þ nancial sector. 
The tensions also moved to Portugal and Spain, 
where spreads vis-à-vis German yields rose by 
110 and 105 basis points respectively in the 
same period, while spillovers to other countries 
such as Greece, Italy and Belgium were limited, 
with spreads there rising by only 7, 42 and 
65 basis points respectively (see Chart 13). 
Heightened market concerns in this Þ nal part of the year translated into an increase in implied 
bond yield volatility in both the United States 
and the euro area.Relative to both nominal yields and 
developments in 2009, real yields ß uctuated 
signiÞ cantly less in 2010 and generally 
remained broadly stable at around 1.5% in 

the euro area. They declined by 50 basis 

points between January and September, but 

that decrease was reversed in full thereafter. 

The subsequent rise mirrored a more robust

2010economic outlook, especially towards the 
end of the year. Given stable real yields, 

declining nominal yields imply that spot 

inß ation expectations, as measured by 
break-even inß ation rates, generally 
decreased over the year, a development that 

was particularly pronounced in July and 

August, with some stabilisation thereafter 

(see also Box 3 below). Five-year forward 

break-even inß ation rates 
Þ ve years ahead 
remained stable at around 2.5% between 

January and July 2010 and subsequently 

fell to around 2% by the end of the year 

(see Chart 14). However, most of this decline 

seems to have been related to a reduction in 

inß ation risk premia, rather than to changes 
in expected inß ation rates. Also, some caution 
is warranted when discussing developments 

in inß ation-linked bonds, especially in an 
environment characterised by distressed 

conditions. In this respect, the results of the 

survey about inß ation expectations over 
medium to long-term horizons undertaken 

by Consensus Economics, although referring 

to a slightly different period of time, pointed 
towards a moderate increase in expected 

inß ation, up from 1.9% in October 2009 to 
2.1% in October 2010. 
Box 3DEVELOPMENTS IN MARKET-BASED MEASURES OF INFLATION EXPECTATIONS IN 2010 
Market-based measures of inß ation expectations are frequently used to assess the in
ß ation outlook. In periods of Þ nancial stress, however, such measures must be interpreted with 
particular care. Although European Þ nancial markets experienced signi
Þ cant tensions in 2010, 
market-based measures of inß ation expectations derived from in
ß ation-linked swaps and those 
derived from nominal and real sovereign bonds were less volatile and less affected by liquidity 
distortions than during the period following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. This box 
reviews developments in inß ation expectations for the euro area in 2010, as implied by the prices 
of Þ nancial market instruments.
In the Þ rst half of the year, the 
Þ ve-year forward break-even in
ß ation rate 
Þ ve years ahead, as 
derived from nominal and inß ation-linked bonds, remained stable overall, oscillating around 
2.5% (see Chart A). During the summer it dropped considerably, and recovered only partly 
towards the beginning of 2011. An alternative measure derived from inß ation-linked swaps 
indicates similar, albeit somewhat less volatile, developments. Overall, volatility in market-based 
measures of inß ation expectations was much lower in 2010 than in previous years. For example, 
the difference between Þ ve-year forward rates 
Þ ve years ahead derived from bonds and those

201070 basis points in the second half of 2008, at the peak of the crisis following the collapse of 
Lehman Brothers.The drop in spot and forward break-even inß ation rates in 2010 took place in an 
environment of somewhat decreasing Þ ve-year real bond yields and stable ten-year real yields 
(see Chart B). Thus, the drop in nominal yields 
largely reß ected a reduction in the amount of 
compensation for future inß ation demanded 
by market participants. This compensation 
comprises a component for expected inß ation and an inß ation risk premium. To disentangle 
these two components, Chart C presents the 
results of the decomposition of long-term

2010In the Þ rst two months of 2011 long-term 
AAA-rated government bond yields in the euro area increased slightly, to above the levels 
prevailing at the end of 2010, while those in the 
United States remained broadly stable around 
those values. The broad stability of long-term 
yields in both economic areas in the Þ rst two 
months of 2011 hides some relatively large 
oscillations. In fact, yields reached a relative 
peak in early February, on account of positive 
economic releases and decreasing tensions 
within the euro area, which was almost fully 
reversed in the remainder of the month, also 
owing to increased geopolitical risks. Within the 
euro area, ten-year yield differentials vis-à-vis 
corresponding German yields narrowed further 
in the Þ rst two months of 2011, re
ß ecting, among other factors, market participants™ 
expectations of a possible extension of the 
scope and size of the EFSF, as well as debt auctions that encountered higher than expected 
demand.THE SPEED OF THE RECOVERY IN EURO AREA 

STOCK PRICES DECREASED IN 2010 
While the gains posted by equity indices in 
both the United States and the euro area were 
comparable in 2009 (approximately 23.5% in 
both cases), developments in the two areas were 
rather different in 2010. With a growth rate of 
almost 13%, the performance of the US index 
was signiÞ cantly better than the broadly 
ß at outcome for the euro area index (see Chart 15). 
Notwithstanding the divergent developments 
recorded for 2010 as a whole, equity prices in 
both economic regions moved clearly sideways 
over the year, with gains and losses, relative 
to end-2009, reaching the order of 10%, so 
that there were signiÞ cant swings in realised 
volatility. Reß ecting these swings, as well as 
were largely due to changes in the inß ation risk 
premium, rather than to changes in inß ation expectations per se, which remained broadly 
stable and close to their long-term average. 
This conclusion is also conÞ rmed by longer-
term survey-based inß ation expectations for 
the euro area, which remained fairly stable in 
2010.Break-even inß ation rates in the euro area 
were somewhat more stable than in the United States in 2010 (see Chart D). While 
the decrease from May to August 2010 was 
part of a broad development that was also 
observed in US indicators, the stabilisation of 
long-term forward rates seen in the euro area 
in the latter part of the year and early 2011 was 
not observed in the United States.Overall, market-based indicators of inß ation expectations for the euro area suggest that the compensation for inß ation and in
ß ation risk demanded by market participants over 
the medium to longer term decreased in 2010, especially during the summer months. This 
development was largely caused by a decline in the inß ation risk premium, while in
ß ation expectations remained broadly stable around their long-term average and Þ rmly anchored in line 
with the ECB™s objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term.Chart D Five-year forward break-even inflation

2010developments in investors™ expectations about future tensions, implied equity price volatility 
also varied considerably throughout 2010, with 
a peak of close to 35% (annualised, on average, 
across the two economic areas) around the 
end of May. The volatility peak in 2010 was 
far lower than that between December 2008 
and March 2009. Overall, throughout 2010 the 
future development of stock prices in the euro 
area was perceived to be more uncertain than 
that in the United States. After positive developments in the latter part 
of 2009, equity prices in both the United States 

and the euro area declined in January and February 

2010, possibly also because sentiment was 

increasingly inß uenced by the ongoing turbulence 
in the euro area sovereign debt market. In the euro 

area, the most pronounced decline in prices was 

recorded by the stocks of Þ nancial Þ rms, whereas 
the performance in other sectors was rather mixed 

and no clear patterns emerged. In the United States, 

by contrast, the Þ nancial sector fared much 
better, especially on account of the robust 

earnings growth reported by major banks. When 
debt-related concerns faded, stock prices in both 

economic areas again rose until approximately 

the beginning of May, reaching the highest 

levels since November 2008. These positive 

developments were also fuelled by data releases 

showing supportive economic developments 

in the Þ rst quarter of the year, as well as by an 
increase in the rate of growth of earnings, which Œ 

although remaining in negative territory Œ started 

to show the Þ rst signs of a recovery from very 
depressed conditions. For the companies listed in 

the Dow Jones EURO STOXX index, earnings 

growth moved from -40% in November 2009 

to -22% in February 2010, while earnings 

expectations over the subsequent 12 months stood 

at a robust 27% on the latter date. 
As debt-related tensions again escalated within the euro area in May, rising global risk aversion 
routed funds towards the markets for German and 
US government bonds, which were perceived to 
be relatively safer assets. As a result, massive 
sell-offs affected the international equity 
markets, overshadowing the positive 
contribution from favourable economic data 
releases, and prices declined signiÞ cantly in 
both areas. As was also the case in January and 
February, euro area Þ nancial stock prices were 
the Þ rst to be affected by the emerging tensions, 
reß ecting concerns about possible write-downs 
on banks™ holdings of euro area government 
debt securities. However, the intensity of the 
turbulence recorded in this period also led to a 
decline in non-Þ nancial stock prices both in the 
euro area and in the United States. Overall, between May and August, equity indices 
continued to oscillate in a narrow range, reß ecting 
ß uctuations in market sentiment and risk aversion. 
While easing tensions and more moderate 
expectations about future volatility made it 
possible for equity prices to initially recover 
the losses recorded in early May, there were 
subsequently renewed losses as global growth 
began to lose momentum and market participants 
again focused attention on debt-related 
problems in selected euro area countries. 
Over the same period, market expectations 
regarding the growth of earnings 12 months Chart 15 Major stock market indices(indices rebased to 100 on 1 January 2010; daily data)406080100

2010ahead remained soundly positive at a rate above 20% in both the United States and the 
euro area, so that the decline in equity prices 
predominantly reß ected a risk-related channel, 
which outweighed the positive contribution of 
favourable developments in expected dividends. In the closing quarter of the year broad 
equity indices rose on both sides of the 

Atlantic. In the United States, stock market 

developments were driven by mixed, 

but generally positive, economic news and 

evidence of favourable developments in earnings 

across listed companies in the third quarter of the 

year. At the same time, this positive effect may 

have been partly offset by investors™ uncertainty 

about the sustainability of the US recovery. In 

the euro area, the positive growth momentum 

supported equity prices, while rising long-term 

interest rates, as well as renewed sovereign debt 

market tensions, may have had a negative impact. 

However, the negative feedback from tensions 

in the European sovereign debt market to the 

European stock market in this period remained 

conÞ ned to the 
Þ nancial sector of those countries 
in which the turbulence had been highest, 

while other sectors and countries continued to 

enjoy the support of solid growth expectations. 

In fact, stock market investors continued to 

price in a fairly positive outlook for most 

corporate sectors other than the Þ nancial 
sector, and the decline in bank stock prices in 

Greece was, moreover, several times greater 

than that recorded for the French and German 

banking sectors. Overall, euro area Þ nancial 
stock prices decreased by around 15% in 2010, 

while non-Þ nancial stock prices increased by 
7.5%. Over the same period, Þ nancial stock prices 
in the United States rose by 11%, while prices of 

non-Þ nancial stocks there gained around 15%. 
In the Þ rst two months of 2011 equity prices 
rose in both the euro area and the United 
States. Unlike in the second half of 2010, 
however, when US equity prices grew by twice 
as much as in the euro area, the gains in the 
Þ rst two months of 2011 were broadly similar 
in the two economic areas, namely around 
5%. Developments in equity prices reß ected primarily proÞ t announcements which were 
generally better than anticipated by market 
participants, as well as continuing improvements 
in the economic outlook in both economic 
areas. HOUSEHOLD BORROWING LEVELLED OFFThe annual growth rate of total loans to 
households increased further in 2010, albeit at 
a moderate pace, standing at an estimated 2.8% 
in the fourth quarter of the year. This mainly 
reß ected developments in MFI loans to 
households, while the annual growth rate of 
non-MFI loans declined further in 2010, largely 
reß ecting the lower degree of securitisation. 
Loans for house purchase remained the main 
driver of growth in MFI loans to households. 
The annual growth rate of mortgage loans 
stood at 3.7% in December 2010, up from 1.5% 
in December 2009 (see Chart 16). However, 
the magnitude of the inß ows stabilised in 
the second half of the year. Developments in 
mortgage loans mirrored trends in residential 
property prices, which saw moderate increases 
in 2010 following signiÞ cant declines in 2009. 
They were also in line with the information 
reported by the euro area bank lending survey, Chart 16 MFI loans to households(annual percentage changes)-20246810

2010which showed a reduction in the net percentage of banks reporting the tightening of their credit 
standards. The survey also reported increases in 
demand for loans for house purchase, especially 
in the Þ rst part of the year. Bank lending rates 
for household borrowing declined modestly 
in 2010: by 19 basis points in the case of loans 
for house purchase, and by 52 basis points in the 
case of loans for consumer credit. By contrast with mortgage loans, the annual growth rate of loans for consumer credit failed 
to recover and remained below zero in 2010. 
Developments in consumer credit were also 
in line with economic factors Œ as indicated, 
for example, by the sharp declines seen in car 
sales (following the expiry in most countries 
of schemes offering incentives to scrap cars) 
or consumer survey results showing a fairly 
limited willingness to make major purchases. 
In addition, the bank lending survey suggested 
that demand for loans for consumer credit 
remained weak. These contrasting developments 
for loans for consumer credit and loans for house purchase may, to some extent, also reß ect interest rates. Loans for consumer credit tend 
to be more expensive to Þ nance than loans 
for house purchase, as they tend not to be as 
well collateralised. However, lending rates on 
loans for consumer credit did decline in 2010, 
particularly for loans with maturities of less than 
one year (see Chart 17). HOUSEHOLDS™ INDEBTEDNESS CONTINUED 
TO INCREASE, WHILE THEIR INTEREST BURDEN 

DECLINED FURTHERIn 2010 the increase in households™ borrowing 

was moderate, but still outpaced the increase in 

their disposable income. As a result, households™ 

indebtedness ratio edged up further to stand at an 

estimated 98.8% in the fourth quarter of the year 

(see Chart 18). By contrast, the ratio of household 

debt to GDP was broadly unchanged from the 

level observed in December 2009, as real GDP 

grew at a higher rate than households™ disposable 

income. While the indebtedness of the household 

sector was broadly unchanged in the euro area 

and declined visibly in the United States and

euro area. At the same time, the indebtedness 

of the household sector continued to display 

considerable heterogeneity across euro area 

countries, remaining clearly above the euro area 

average in countries that also witnessed tensions 

in the sovereign debt market. 
Households™ interest payment burden (i.e. interest payments as a percentage of disposable income) 
declined moderately in 2010, albeit stabilising 
towards the end of the year. This reß ected two factors: a further reduction in the interest 
rates applied to new or renegotiated loans as 
the pass-through from ofÞ cial interest rates 
ran its course; and the slight increase seen in 
households™ disposable income. HISTORICALLY LOW COST OF EXTERNAL 

FINANCING IN 2010After the sharp decline in 2009, the real overall 
cost of external Þ nancing for non-
Þ nancial corporations in the euro area rebounded 
somewhat amid heightened sovereign debt 
crisis-related tensions in Þ nancial markets in 
the course of 2010. This development concealed 
substantial differences across different sources 
of Þ nancing. While the decline in the real 
cost of both bank lending and debt securities 
issuance bottomed out in 2010, the real cost of 
issuing equity increased sharply, rising to record 
levels by the end of the year (see Chart 19). 
All in all, the real overall cost of external 
Þ nancing in 2010 remained at a low level by 
historical standards.More precisely, where the cost of bank-based 
Þ nancing is concerned, real short-term MFI 
lending rates declined moderately from 1.62% 

in December 2009 to 1.40% in December 2010. 

Bank lending rates at short maturities primarily 

reß ect developments in money market rates, 
which normally affect banks™ short-term funding 

costs. Between the end of 2009 and the end 

of 2010 the three-month EURIBOR actually 

increased moderately by 33 basis points: 

it bottomed out at 0.64% in April 2010 and then 

rose slowly to 1.03% at the end of the year. 

Its development was closely mirrored by 
nominal short-term bank interest rates on loans to 

non-Þ nancial corporations, but gradually rising 
short-term inß ation expectations led to a decline 
of 22 basis points in real short-term bank lending 

rates over the year.Real long-term MFI lending rates bottomed out 
at the beginning of 2010, resulting in a slight 

increase from 1.56% at the end of 2009 to 

1.71% at the end of 2010. Banks™ longer-term 

lending rates tend to reß ect mainly movements 
in government bond yields. The seven-year 

government bond yield derived from the euro 

area yield curve continued to decrease during 

most of 2010, reaching 2.11% in August, and 

then rose towards the end of the year, leading 

to an overall decline of 33 basis points between 

December 2009 and December 2010. Nominal 

long-term lending rates did not follow the same 

pattern, stabilising earlier in the year and showing 

a moderately rising trend towards the end of 

2010. As a result, the spreads between long-term 

bank lending rates and comparable government 

bond yields tended to widen again and peaked at

2010more than 100 basis points during the sovereign 
debt crisis in the spring, thereby returning to 

the orders of magnitude that had been observed 

during the Þ nancial turmoil in 2008.
Developments in MFI lending rates in 2010 
also largely reß ected the gradually fading 
pass-through of past declines in key ECB interest 
rates to banks™ rates for retail customers. Despite 
the Þ nancial turmoil, euro area banks appear to 
have passed on the reduction of key policy rates 
broadly in line with historical patterns. The real cost of market-based debt Þ nancing 
was inß uenced signi
Þ cantly by developments 
in corporate bond spreads (measured as the 
difference between the yields on corporate bonds 

and that on government bonds) throughout 2010. 

Despite increasing spreads between May and 

August 2010, amid intensifying tensions in the 

sovereign debt market which pushed Þ nancial 
investors towards more liquid and safer assets, 

the average real cost of market-based Þ nancing 
in 2010 stood below that of previous years 

and dropped to one of the lowest levels ever 

recorded. 
By contrast, the real cost of issuing quoted equity increased markedly in 2010, driven by, 
in particular, a rapid recovery in corporate sector 
earnings expectations two to Þ ve years ahead. 
Between December 2009 and December 2010, 
this cost rose by 194 basis points and reached an 
all-time high on the back of heightened volatility 
in global Þ nancial markets.
EXTERNAL FINANCING CONTINUED 

TO DECLINE IN 2010The annual rate of growth of the external 

Þ nancing of non-
Þ nancial corporations in 
the euro area continued to decline in 2010, 

driven by the ongoing contraction of MFI 

lending, which was counterbalanced by 

positive but declining debt security and 

equity issuance (see Chart 20). Despite broad-
based improvements in economic conditions, 

non-Þ nancial corporations™ need for external 
Þ nancing continued to be limited by subdued 
investment expenditure and reduced activities 
in the Þ eld of mergers and acquisitions, 
as well as by an ongoing expansion of 

available internal funds. Towards the end 

of 2010 signals of gradual normalisation and 

increased corporate Þ nancing needs came to 
the fore. According to the bank lending survey, 

net demand for corporate loans turned positive, 

after having remained in negative territory 

for more than two years. Inventories and 

working capital, in particular, were reported 

to be contributing increasingly to this renewed 

demand for loans.More speciÞ cally, one of the main factors 
driving the relatively low demand for external 
Þ nancing in 2010 was the broad-based 
pick-up in non-Þ nancial corporate sector sales 
and proÞ tability, which signi
Þ cantly improved 
the availability of internal funds. Based on 

Þ nancial statements from listed non-
Þ nancial 
corporations, proÞ tability Œ measured by the 
ratio of net income to sales Œ rebounded 

strongly in 2010 (see Chart 21). The increase 

in available internal funds reß ected higher 
money holdings, most probably stemming 

from both persistent cost-cutting and reduced 

net interest payments and dividends.

2010Þ rms needs to be quali
Þ ed, as survey results 
showed that the proÞ tability of small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) developed 
less favourably in 2010 than that of large 

Þ rms, suggesting that SMEs may be more 
fragile than larger Þ rms, or may be lagging 
somewhat behind them.4In addition to beneÞ ting from the improvement 
in the availability of internal funds, euro area 
non-Þ nancial corporations appear to have drawn 
on a broader range of sources of Þ nancing in 
recent years, replacing bank-based debt with market-based Þ nancing and making increasing 
use of debt securities issuance in particular. 
This process of ﬁdisintermediationﬂ started in 
2009 and continued in 2010, translating into 
substantially lower demand for bank loans. 
Accordingly, the annual growth rate of loans, 
which bottomed out in the Þ rst quarter of the 
year, remained in negative territory throughout 
2010. Short-term lending activity suffered 
particularly markedly, as the decline in demand 
for loans was ampliÞ ed by an ongoing move 
from short to longer maturities. On average, 
the annual growth rate of short-term loans 
(i.e. loans with a Þ xed initial maturity of less 
than one year) declined to nearly -9% in 2010, 
while that of long-term loans (i.e. loans with 
a Þ xed initial maturity in excess of 
Þ ve years) 
actually remained positive at around 3%. 
However, taking into account the particular 
severity of the recent recession and this 
substitution process, developments in corporate 
sector loan growth appear to have remained 
broadly in line with historical regularities over 
the business cycle. The impact of the Þ nancial crisis was signiÞ cant, but did not translate into 
an abrupt disruption of the provision of credit 
to the economy. In the course of the year, banks 
started to report a lower degree of tightening 
for loans to enterprises, mainly owing to the 
lower contribution of risk-based factors such as 
the general economic conditions or borrowers™ 
default risk (see Box 4).See ﬁSurvey on the access to Þ nance of SMEs in the euro areaﬂ, 4 ECB, October 2010 (available on the ECB™s website).Box 4INTERPRETING SURVEY INDICATORS OF CREDIT STANDARDS ON LOANS TO ENTERPRISES 
The Þ nancial crisis prompted an exceptional tightening of euro area banks™ credit standards on 
loans to the private sector and, in particular, non-Þ nancial corporations in 2008. Since 2009 
credit standards have continued to tighten, albeit to a gradually diminishing extent. This box 
reviews in detail developments in survey indicators of credit standards, notably in 2010, and 
interprets the extent to which they may provide evidence of credit supply constraints.Chart 21 Profit ratios of listed euro area

2010A gradual normalisation of survey indicators 
of credit standards applied to loans 
The detailed results of the bank lending 
survey published by the ECB include the net 

percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards on loans to non-Þ nancial 
corporations, calculated as the difference 

between the percentages of respondents 

answering that they tightened their credit 

conditions somewhat or considerably and those 

responding that they eased their credit conditions 

somewhat or considerably. Hence positive 

Þ gures indicate a net tightening and negative 
Þ gures a net easing of credit standards. During 
the Þ nancial turmoil, the net percentage of 
banks reporting a tightening of credit standards 

increased dramatically, up to 64% at the end of 

2008. Since then, this net percentage has gradually decreased Œ without, however, turning into 

an easing of credit standards. In 2010 euro area banks maintained a moderate tightening stance 

throughout the year, with the net percentage of banks responding that they had tightened credit 

standards hovering at levels slightly below the long-term average (see Chart A). In the second 

quarter of the year, contrary to expectations, the downward trend in the net tightening of credit 

standards on loans to enterprises was temporarily reversed, amid tensions brought about by the 

sovereign debt crisis. After the negative developments in credit standards on loans to enterprises 

in the second quarter of 2010, data for the second half of the year pointed to stabilisation, with 4%, 

followed by 0%, of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards in net terms. 
The pressure on capital ratios and funding positions associated with the Þ nancial turmoil that 
started in mid-2007 has pressed euro area banks to review their leverage ratios. Typically, banks have found themselves in a situation in which they have had to shed assets, starting with those of a 
more liquid shorter-term nature, while credit to Þ rms and households, as longer-term assets, stood 
at the bottom of the list of assets to be shed. In general, such assets can only be reduced by calling 
in loans or restricting new lending. Hence, some of the recent tightening in credit standards can be 
explained by these ﬁpureﬂ supply-side constraints that are linked to banks™ balance sheet concerns. 
Detailed survey results indicate that in 2010 the perception of risks, i.e. banks™ assessment of the 
impact that macroeconomic conditions may have on borrowers™ risk proÞ les and creditworthiness, 
actually played a leading role in explaining the tightening of credit standards. Compared with 2008 
and 2009, ﬁpureﬂ supply-side constraints appear to offer less of an explanation for the tightening 
of credit standards, pointing to a gradual normalisation of the willingness of banks to lend to the 
private sector. This is likely to further reduce the risk of a credit crunch, which did not materialise 
on account of a slump in demand for loans, while the impact of ﬁpureﬂ supply-side constraints 
was limited by the ECB™s non-standard monetary policy measures.Evidence from the bank lending survey can be usefully complemented with results from the survey on the access to Þ nance of small and medium-sized 
Þ rms. The latest such survey of 
SMEs, which covered the period from March to September 2010, pointed to a mild improvement 
in the availability of bank loans (see Chart B). SMEs continued to perceive, on balance, Chart A Changes in credit standards applied

2010an overall worsening of this availability, but the number of respondents reporting 
a deterioration halved in comparison with 
survey rounds carried out in 2009. Where 
large Þ rms are concerned, more companies 
reported an improvement in the availability 
of bank loans than a deterioration. Survey 
results also pointed to a higher success rate 
when applying for bank loans and to a slightly 
greater willingness of banks to provide loans.An alternative interpretation of survey results on credit standardsWhile 2010 survey results suggest a gradual normalisation of credit standards on loans, it 
is worth highlighting that these results focus 
on changes, and an assessment of the level of 
credit standards is not directly provided. Given 
that credit standards have been tightened 
continuously for more than two years, one may 
wonder whether and how the level of credit 
standards can affect the overall credit supply.A proxy for the level of credit standards can, in principle, be derived by cumulating net 
percentage changes in credit conditions over 
time. In doing so, an upward trend in the series 
becomes apparent. This may indicate a bias 
in banks™ answers towards tightening credit 
standards. The same phenomenon can actually 
be observed in the US equivalent of the bank 
lending survey for the euro area, the ﬁSenior 
Loan OfÞ cer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practicesﬂ. One can assume that the long-term 
average of credit standards (which stands at 
an average net tightening of 16%) is a very 
simple measure of this bias. At the same time, 
given the relatively short observation period 
available, this long-term average includes 
more tightening than easing cycles, and 
may thus overestimate the actual bias. Once 
detrended to take into account the possible 
bias, cumulated credit standards can be used to 
deÞ ne different credit standard regimes, where 
negative deviations from the trend indicate an 
expansive credit standard stance and positive 
deviations a restrictive stance.Chart B Availability of bank loans

2010The annual growth of debt securities issuance actually peaked at 12.3% in the Þ rst quarter 
of 2010, and gradually slowed down over the 
rest of the year. Strong demand from investors 
throughout most of the year may have been 
supported by a search for a return on investment 
and by the improvement in corporate sector 
balance sheets. In the high-yield segment, 
issuance reached record highs in 2010. At the 
same time, issuance of quoted shares remained 
contained and tended to decrease, possibly 
dampened by the rising cost of issuing equity.DECLINE IN CORPORATE INDEBTEDNESSAs the pick-up in corporate proÞ ts was not 
accompanied by a signiÞ cant increase in 
investment, nor by robust growth in employees™ 
overall compensation, the rebound in income 
ß ows translated into a sharp increase in the 
savings ratio of the euro area non-Þ nancial corporate sector, which continued throughout 
2010. In the second quarter of 2010 the rate of 
growth of total assets turned positive for the Þ rst time since early 2009, driven by an accumulation 
of cash. Owing both to deleveraging efforts 
by companies and to the rapid increase in 
corporate savings relative to GDP, the Þ nancing gap (broadly speaking, the extent to which non-Þ nancial corporations need to have recourse 
to external sources of funding to cover their 
investment) turned positive in 2010, for the 
Þ rst time in more than a decade, mechanically 
suggesting that Þ rms had enough internal funds 
to cover their Þ nancing needs for investment. 
Based on such an analysis, the period from 2003 to 2004 may be identiÞ ed as a ﬁrestrictive credit 
standard regimeﬂ for loans to enterprises, while that from early 2005 to mid-2008 corresponds 

to an ﬁexpansive credit standard regimeﬂ (see Chart C). Thereafter, the indicator points to a 

renewed period of credit restrictions and was still well above its historical trend at the end of 2010. 
In general, a tightening of credit standards tends to curb loan growth, while an easing of credit 
standards leads to an increase in loan growth. Empirical evidence using the level indicator reveals 

additional non-linear effects. In particular, the impact of credit standards on loan growth appears to 

be mitigated depending on the credit standard regime: in the case of a regime of restrictive credit 

standards, the negative impact of net tightening of credit standards on loan growth is not as strong as it 

is during a period of expansive credit standards (as seen, for example, between mid-2007 and 2008). 

Similarly, the positive impact of a net easing in credit standards on loan growth is moderated 

under a restrictive credit standard regime and credit standards require a longer period of continued 

easing to positively impact on credit growth. This seems very relevant to actual developments 

in 2010. Owing to the lagged impact of the tightening of credit standards and to these apparent 

non-linear effects, the results of the 2010 bank lending survey point to a potential negative impact 

of supply-side factors on loan growth beyond the end of 2010 and into the Þ rst half of 2011, 
despite an apparent normalisation of changes in credit standards. Looking further ahead, it remains 

a challenge to expand the availability of credit to the private sector when demand Þ rms up.

2010As a consequence, corporate indebtedness declined substantially in the course of 2010 
(see Chart 22). In the third quarter of 2010 
the debt-to-GDP and debt-to-gross operating 
surplus ratios dropped to 80.6% and 421.1% 
respectively. Nevertheless, expected default 
rates for euro area corporations remained at very 
high levels for most of 2010. Indeed, debt ratios 
remain at very high historical levels and suggest 
that the euro area corporate sector remains 
vulnerable to higher external Þ nancing costs or 
subdued economic activity. 2.3 PRICE AND COST DEVELOPMENTS 
In 2010 annual HICP inß ation increased 
to 1.6%, on average, after falling to 0.3% 
in 2009 from 3.3% in 2008 (see Table 1). 
This rise marks a move towards a normalisation 
in price developments, with positive annual 
HICP inß ation in 2010 contrasting with the 
negative Þ gures seen in the period from June to 
October 2009. Although annual HICP inß ation in 
2010 was below the average of 2.0% since 1999, 
it started to rise towards the end of the year.The increase in HICP inß ation over 2010 
stemmed largely from considerably higher commodity prices (especially for crude oil), 
compared with the low levels registered in 2009 
(see Chart 23). The dynamics in commodity 
prices in turn reß ected the recovery from 
the global economic downturn experienced 
in 2009, which had pushed those prices down. 
The contribution of higher commodity prices 
to HICP inß ation in 2010 more than offset the 
lower pressures exerted on services prices, 
which were affected by the severe recession and 
deteriorating labour market conditions of 2009 
with a lag. After declining gradually over the 
course of 2009, annual services price inß ation fell slightly further at the beginning of 2010 and 
remained relatively unchanged thereafter.Concerning wage growth in 2010, there are indications that the stabilisation of labour market 
conditions led to a bottoming-out in labour 
cost dynamics. Compensation per employee grew in 2010 at a rate comparable to that seen 
in the previous year, being outpaced by labour 
productivity growth per person employed 
and thus allowing unit labour costs to fall and 
proÞ t margins to rise. Nonetheless, growth in 
negotiated wages moderated markedly, probably 
capturing a lagged reaction of contractual 
settlements to market conditions. Growth in 
hourly wages also fell sharply, to some extent 
simply reß ecting the effect of a higher number 
of hours worked. Chart 23 Breakdown of HICP inflation:

2010Consumer inß ation perceptions and 
short-term expectations rose in 2010 from their very low levels of 2009. Long-term inß ation expectations, as measured by surveys, were very 
stable, indicating that expectations remained 
Þ rmly anchored to the Governing Council™s aim 
of keeping inß ation below, but close to, 2% over 
the medium term.HICP INFLATION WAS ON THE RISE OWING TO 

ENERGY AND FOOD PRICE DEVELOPMENTSA pronounced increase in commodity prices 
was the main factor pushing up euro area 
HICP inß ation in 2010. Industrial, food and, in 
particular, energy commodity prices rose from 
the low levels reached in 2009 (see Box 5), 
with the result that HICP inß ation increased, 
despite the dampening effects of easing wage 
growth and still low activity levels. The low 
level of labour cost pressures also affected 
annual services price inß ation, which fell 
slightly further at the start of 2010 and remained 
at a rather low level for the rest of the year 
(see Table 1 and Chart 24).Table 1 Price developments(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated)2008200920102009201020102010201020102011

2010Box 5THE DYNAMICS OF COMMODITY PRICES AND THEIR IMPACT ON HICP INFLATIONLarge swings in commodity prices have 
been a major concern in recent years. While 

both oil and non-oil commodity prices fell 

abruptly in the wake of the Þ nancial crisis, 
they have rebounded since 2009 (see Chart A). 

As commodity prices are an important factor 

for the dynamics of euro area HICP inß ation, 
this box analyses recent developments in and 

the prospects for international commodity 

prices, assessing their impact on euro area HICP 

inß ation, both conceptually and empirically.
Developments in commodity pricesOil prices rose from around USD 45 per barrel 
at the end of 2008 to USD 97 per barrel in 
January 2011. Metal and food commodity 
prices also rose sharply over the same 
period. These rises may have been related to 
more positive expectations about the global 
economic upturn. OPEC production cuts also 
supported oil prices in the course of 2010, 
while the surge in metal and food commodity 
prices is likely to have reß ected growing demand from emerging economies, supply shortages 
and low inventory levels. The role of Þ nancial ß ows and speculation in commodity markets has been debated intensely, although their actual impact is difÞ cult to measure empirically.
Looking ahead, the medium-term prospects for commodity prices are likely to be linked to the 
international outlook for economic activity. As the global recovery takes hold, the supply and 
demand balance in the oil market may tighten and non-oil commodity prices may face upward 
pressures. Although it is difÞ cult to project the future course of commodity prices, various 
forward-looking indicators Œ such as futures prices and expectations of investment banks 
and other professional forecasters Œ consistently point to rising commodity prices over the 
medium term.The transmission of a commodity price shock: conceptual frameworkThe impact of a commodity price shock on consumer prices can be broken down into direct and indirect Þ rst-round and second-round effects.
1 Direct Þ rst-round effects refer to the impact of 
changes in the prices of primary commodities (e.g. food and oil) on consumer food and energy 1 See the article entitled ﬁOil prices and the euro area economyﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin, ECB, November 2004, and the box entitled ﬁRecent oil price developments and their impact on euro area pricesﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, July 2004.Chart A Commodity price developments(index: 2010 = 100)4060

2010prices. Indirect Þ rst-round effects refer to changes in consumer prices that occur as a result of the 
impact of changes in commodity prices on producer costs (e.g. an oil price increase that raises input costs and the prices of goods and services that have a signiÞ cant oil content, such as certain 
chemicals and transport services). First-round effects drive up price levels, but have no lasting 
inß ationary effect.
Second-round effects capture the reaction of wage and price setters to the commodity price shock. 
Attempts by economic agents to compensate for the loss of real income caused by past inß ation shocks may affect inß ation expectations and further inß uence price and wage-setting behaviour. Thus, a transitory shock may become entrenched and more costly to eradicate. The likelihood of a 
commodity price shock leading to second-round effects depends on several factors, including the 
cyclical position of the economy, the ß exibility of product and labour markets (particularly the 
presence of indexation mechanisms affecting wage bargaining and price setting), the reaction of 
inß ation expectations and, crucially in connection with this, the credibility of the central bank.
Oil price shocks and HICP inß ationOil price ß uctuations have a direct impact on HICP in
ß ation via the energy component of the HICP. 
The direct pass-through of oil price shocks to pre-tax consumer energy prices is generally found 
to be complete, quick and symmetric.2 Owing to the fact that energy prices at the consumer level, 
in particular those of transport and home heating fuels, also depend on factors such as reÞ ning and 
distribution costs and margins, as well as substantial excise taxes, the elasticity of the pass-through 

turns out to be a function of the level of crude oil prices (see the table). At •20 per barrel, the 

response of HICP energy prices to a 10% rise in crude oil prices is around 16%; at levels of •60 per 

barrel, it is around 33%. Were oil prices to increase to •100 per barrel, the elasticity would exceed 

40%, assuming constant reÞ ning margins, distribution margins and excise taxes.
Estimating the indirect and second-round effects of changes in energy prices is more challenging 
and the results are surrounded by greater uncertainty. For example, according to simple, 
non-structural models, the cumulated indirect and second-round effects on HICP inß ation, after

2) Weight in the overall HICP.57ECBAnnual Report
2010three years of a 10% increase in oil prices, is around 0.2 percentage point.3 However, more complex models, in which expectations play 
a formal role and the response of the real 
side of the economy, as well as its feedback 
effects on nominal variables, are explicitly 
captured, point to a smaller impact of around 
0.1 percentage point, in so far as the energy 
price shock is perceived as transitory and 
inß ation expectations remain 
Þ rmly anchored 
following the change in energy prices.The impact of changes in the prices 
of industrial raw materials and food 
commoditiesEmpirical evidence suggests that a permanent  

10% increase in the prices of industrial raw 
materials (e.g. agricultural raw materials and 
metals) leads to a rise in the HICP of below 
0.1 percentage point within three years, with 
a very small impact in the Þ rst year. Industrial raw materials are used in the production of a 
wide range of HICP items, either as direct inputs (e.g. metals for cars or textiles for garments) 
or as indirect inputs into equipment used to produce goods and services. In the early stages of 
the production process, industrial raw materials are of high relevance and there is a clear lagged 
relationship between movements in their prices and industrial producer prices for intermediate 
goods in the euro area (see Chart B). However, with regard to Þ nal consumption goods, the proportion of industrial raw material input is relatively small compared with other inputs, such as 
labour and energy, which explains the relatively low pass-through.4A permanent 10% increase in food commodity prices is estimated to add around 0.5 percentage 
point to overall HICP food prices and, given that food items represent 19.2% of the HICP basket, 
0.1 percentage point to overall HICP inß ation in the 
Þ rst year after the shock. This estimate 
takes into account the fact that, for a number of food commodities produced directly in the EU 
(such as cereals, wheat and corn, as well as butter and skimmed milk), prices in international 
markets have historically been somewhat lower and signiÞ cantly more volatile than those 
prevailing in the EU. To a large extent, the difference is attributable to the Common Agricultural 
Policy, which helps to cushion the transmission of global shocks to EU internal prices through 
price support mechanisms, such as intervention prices, import tariffs and quotas.5Overall, the pass-through of commodity price shocks to consumer prices is complex and a result 
of many factors, including the source of the shock (whether it is demand or supply-driven), 
expectations in terms of whether it will be transitory or permanent, as well as structural aspects 3 Energy markets and the euro area macroeconomy, Structural Issues Report, ECB, June 2010.4 See Landau, B. and Skudelny, F., ﬁPass-through of external shocks along the pricing chain: A panel estimation approach for the euro

2010Driven by global oil prices, the energy component of the HICP Œ constituting 9.6% 
of the overall HICP Œ was on the rise in 
2010, reaching a 12-month average of 7.4%, 
a reversal from the fall of 8.1% in 2009. The 
impact of this increase was strongest on the 
prices of items directly connected to oil prices, 
such as liquid fuels, and fuels and lubricants 
for personal transport equipment, and with a 
lag in the case of consumer gas prices. Food 
prices also increased, especially unprocessed 
food prices, which rose by 1.2% on average 
in 2010, from only 0.2% in 2009. In addition 
to escalating global food commodity prices, 
consumer food price inß ation re
ß ected temporary adverse domestic weather conditions 
that weighed on fruit and vegetable prices.
The acceleration in inß ation over the last few 
months of 2010 was relatively modest in the 
processed food component Œ which includes 
items such as bread and cereals Œ so that the 
12-month average (at 0.9%) was even lower in 
2010 than the 1.1% reached in 2009.Excluding energy and food prices, average 
HICP inß ation was lower in 2010 than in 2009. 
This decline was driven by the dampening 

impact of domestic factors on services price 

inß ation, coupled with relatively stable average 
annual inß ation for non-energy industrial goods. 
It also masked the gradual increase in annual 

HICP inß ation excluding energy and food 
from the very low level reached in the 

second quarter of 2010. This increase was 

attributable to upward price pressures along 

the supply chain, such as increases in the 

prices of intermediate goods and in capacity 

utilisation rates. Moreover, higher indirect taxes 
and the depreciation of the effective exchange 

rate of the euro weighed on annual inß ation for 
non-energy industrial goods, which rose from a 

low of 0.1% throughout the Þ rst quarter of 2010 
to stand at 0.7% in December. The increase 

in non-energy industrial goods prices was 

mitigated to some extent by subdued labour 

cost developments. In contrast to the rise in 

non-energy industrial goods inß ation over the 
course of 2010, the intra-annual developments 

observed in annual services price inß ation were 
very limited, following a slight further decline 

at the start of the year. As a result, annual 

services price inß ation continued to moderate 
in 2010 as a whole, standing at 1.4%, after 2.0% 

in 2009. This lower rate of change in services 

prices was rather broad-based, reß ecting more 
contained cost pressures, as well as greater 

competition for customers in the face of 

relatively weak demand. One exception was 

communication services, whose contribution, 

which is customarily negative, became less 

negative. 
PRODUCER PRICES INCREASED IN 2010Upward supply chain price pressures developed 
over 2010, owing primarily to higher global 
demand for raw materials. This led to a rise 
in producer prices at various stages of the 
production chain, which was magniÞ ed by the 
base effects stemming from constrained activity 
and greater competition in 2009.The annual growth rate of producer prices for industrial goods (excluding construction) in the 
euro area was 2.9% in 2010, compared with a 
fall of 5.1% in 2009. The main driver of these 
price developments was oil prices, which pushed 
the annual rate of change in producer prices for 
energy items up to 6.4% in 2010, compared with 
a decrease of 11.8% in 2009.Excluding construction and energy, the annual growth rate of industrial producer prices also 
increased, but to a far lesser extent (1.6% in 
2010, compared with a fall of 2.9% in 2009). of the economy, including the sectoral specialisation, and wage and price-setting institutions. 
While there is little monetary policy can do about the Þ rst-round effects of a commodity 
price shock, second-round effects must be avoided. In this regard, more ß exible wage and 
price-setting mechanisms and a credible monetary policy are key to ensuring that one-off changes 
in commodity prices do not translate into higher inß ation in the medium term.
59ECBAnnual Report
2010This swing was particularly marked in the intermediate goods component, and less so in 
the consumer and capital goods components 
(see Chart 25). LABOUR COST DEVELOPMENTS WERE MUTEDLabour cost indicators for the euro area pointed 
to a moderation in labour cost developments 
in the course of 2010, with signs that wage 
dynamics bottomed out. While the annual growth 
rates of both negotiated wages and hourly wages 
declined considerably, growth in compensation per employee in 2010 was comparable to the 
low level registered in the previous year.Negotiated wages decelerated markedly in the course of 2010 to reach an annual growth 
rate of 1.6% in the fourth quarter, down from 
2.6% in 2009. This indicator captures the main 
component of wages settled in advance through 
collective agreements. Its slowdown may reß ect a lagged reaction of contractual settlements 
to the deteriorating labour market conditions, 
which led to a decrease in the bargaining power 
of workers (see Table 2).The annual growth rate of compensation per employee was 1.5% in the third quarter of 2010, 
unchanged from 2009. Three types of activity 
displayed faster growth in compensation 
per employee, namely industry excluding 
construction, market services involved in trade 
and transport, and market services relating to 
Þ nance and business activities. In the other 
sectors, growth in compensation per employee 
declined (see Chart 26). As with negotiated wages, the annual growth rate of hourly labour costs slowed signiÞ cantly, in contrast to what was witnessed in 2009, when 
increases in hourly wages remained elevated. 
The decline in hourly wage growth may simply 
partly reß ect the impact of a higher number of 
hours worked, as longer hours worked do not 
necessarily result in the higher compensation 
of employees in the context of various schemes 
(such as ß exible time accounts and government-
subsidised short-time work schemes). The fall Table 2 Labour cost indicators(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated)2008200920102009

2010in the annual growth rate of hourly labour costs in the course of 2010 was driven by industrial 
activities. In 2009 the latter sector exhibited the 
highest hourly wage growth and made the most 
intensive use of ß exible time measures. 
Labour productivity growth per employee 
exceeded the gains in compensation per 
employee in the euro area, thus implying that 
unit labour costs fell and that proÞ t margins 
increased. Annual labour productivity growth 
per employee rose to 2.2% on average in the 
Þ rst three quarters of 2010, compared with a 
drop of 2.3% in 2009. Given the developments 
in compensation per employee, unit labour costs 
fell by 0.5% in the year to the third quarter of 
2010, compared with a rise of 3.9% in 2009 
(see Chart 27). Mirroring this decrease in unit 
labour costs, operating margins recovered, with 
the greater pricing power attested by the gradual 
increase in the annual growth rate of the GDP 
deß ator. This increase also re
ß ected a positive 
contribution from the unit tax component from 
the second quarter of 2010 (see Chart 28).RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES ROSE 
Euro area residential property prices, which are 
not included in the HICP, increased by 2.4% in 
the year to the third quarter of 2010, following 
a decline of 2.9% in 2009 (see Chart 29).

2010were driven by the recovery in global activity 
and demand. Second, inventories contributed 

positively, especially in the Þ rst half of the 
year, as businesses slowed down the pace of 

destocking. Third, domestic demand (excluding 

inventories) showed a modest recovery, with 

government consumption continuing to grow, 

and private consumption and investment no 

longer contracting as they had in 2009, but rather 

growing slightly (in annual terms) in the third 

quarter of 2010. The improvement in private 

consumption and investment partly reß ected a rise 
in conÞ dence from the previously very low levels. 
The recovery in euro area economic activity 

has also been supported by the accommodative 

monetary policy stance and the measures adopted 

to restore the functioning of the Þ nancial system.
RISE IN GDP PREDOMINANTLY SUPPORTED BY 

EXPORTS AND INVENTORIES 
The economic expansion of 2010 was largely 
driven by exports and inventories. Government 
consumption continued to increase, while 
both private consumption and investment 
displayed moderate annual growth in the third 
quarter of 2010, after contracting in 2009. The 
positive contribution from inventories was 
mostly limited to the Þ rst half of the year, as 
Þ rms decided to destock more slowly than in 
2009. Euro area exports beneÞ ted from the 
improvement in the external environment 
associated with the easing of the Þ nancial crisis. This was reß ected in stronger growth 
in both developed and emerging countries. 
The surge in foreign demand led to a particularly 
sharp increase in exports in the course of 2010. 
However, this did not result in a positive 
contribution from net exports overall, owing 
to the increase in imports, which proceeded at 
a marginally faster pace. Private consumption 
and investment resumed positive growth, but 
did not fully recover from the impact of the 
recent unprecedented Þ nancial turmoil and the 
economic recession (see Chart 30).Growth in private consumption was positive, 
at 1.0% in the year to the third quarter of 

2010, following the contraction of 1.1% in 

2009. This recovery was supported by real 
disposable income growth and a decrease 

in precautionary savings in view of reduced 

uncertainty, owing to the gradual stabilisation 

seen in the labour market. Wealth effects from

2010improving asset markets may have been another 
supporting factor (see Box 6). The increase 

in private consumption was accompanied 

by improving consumer conÞ dence in 2010 
(see Chart 31). While overall real disposable 

income contributed to private consumption 

growth, the still weak labour market conditions 

were the main factor limiting the recovery 
in household spending. Private consumption 

was especially dampened by household 

demand for cars, which continued to decline. 

However, this decline masked considerable 

divergence between countries, which can, 

in part, be traced back to differences in the 

withdrawal from Þ scal stimulus packages, 
in particular car scrappage schemes.Box 6EURO AREA HOUSEHOLD SAVING BEHAVIOUR 
During the 2008-09 recession the euro area 
household saving ratio rose sharply. On a 
four-quarter moving sum basis, the saving 
ratio peaked at 15.2% in the fourth quarter 
of 2009, which was 1.4 percentage points 
higher than at the start of the recession in the 
Þ rst quarter of 2008. In 2010 the saving ratio 
subsequently declined, falling to 14.2% in the 
third quarter (see Chart A). This box reviews 
the factors that shaped saving behaviour in the 
euro area during the recession and ongoing 
recovery, and discusses the likely evolution of 
saving in the future. Theoretical motives behind household saving behaviourTheory suggests a variety of motives for household consumption and saving decisions, 
which can be difÞ cult to disentangle. A key 
principle is that people base their consumption 
on the real income they expect to receive over 
their entire lifetime. In this respect, household saving is a means of smoothing consumption in 
the face of variations in income, both over long horizons (for example, by saving for retirement) 
and over shorter periods (in case of temporary ß uctuations in income). However, ß uctuations in income may not be the only determinant of a change in saving 
ratios. The saving levels of some households are affected by developments in their Þ nancial and non-Þ nancial wealth, as increases in the value of their net asset holdings are an important 
additional source of current and future purchasing power. They may also be affected by the 
degree of uncertainty surrounding future income (for example, in relation to employment 
prospects). This may lead households to hold higher cash reserves, which they can then use Chart A Household income, consumption

2010in the event of unexpected reductions in income Œ a tendency that is known as ﬁprecautionary savingﬂ. Furthermore, household saving decisions are likely to be inß uenced by the decisions 
and actions of other economic agents. For example, changes in government Þ nances can 
be an important factor: an increase in government debt may cause households to behave in a 
ﬁRicardianﬂ fashion, i.e. to raise their saving levels, at least to some extent, in anticipation of 
future tax liabilities. Recent developments in euro area household savingThe rise in the saving ratio during the recession is not easy to reconcile with the notion of consumption smoothing in the face of a reduction in income. One key factor which may have 
inß uenced household saving decisions during the recession was uncertainty about future income 
prospects in the light of the Þ nancial crisis and the downturn in economic activity. Employment declined markedly during the recession and unemployment in the euro area increased. Job security 
was thus a particular concern for households, pushing them to reduce their expenditure and 
supplement their precautionary savings. Since the end of the recession, however, the European 
Commission™s consumer conÞ dence indicator has suggested that households have become more 
optimistic about the economic situation and, in particular, unemployment developments in the 
euro area. This is likely to be one reason why household saving rates fell during 2010. It is also possible that household behaviour in the recent cycle was affected by changing expectations with regard to future income. Households may have come to expect a permanent 
decline in housing wealth as a result of the corrections in housing markets in many euro area 
countries. In addition, falls in equity markets during 2008 and early 2009 led to a marked drop 
in households™ Þ nancial wealth. Both developments encouraged households to save more. 
Since then Þ nancial markets have rallied and the latest available information suggests some 
bottoming-out in house prices in the euro area as a whole. These two factors have contributed 
to a (year-on-year) rise in euro area households™ net worth (see Chart B) since the Þ nal quarter 
of 2009 and may partly explain the declines in saving observed during 2010. However, 
there may still be concerns about the state of 
balance sheets in some regions of the euro 
area, in particular those where asset prices 
and debt levels rose in the years prior to the 
Þ nancial crisis, which may be encouraging 
some households to continue with higher rates 
of saving. A further source of uncertainty since the Þ nancial crisis began has been the implications 
of the large increases in government deÞ cits. The operation of automatic stabilisers during 
the recession helped to cushion households™ 
income, for example, through reduced taxes 
and increased transfers. Certain discretionary 
government measures, for example the 
subsidies on car purchases provided in 
many euro area countries, also encouraged 
consumption during the recession. However, Chart B Household net financial worth(year-on-year growth; contributions to year-on-year growth)-20-15

2010Government consumption growth continued to support economic activity in 2010, but was 
more moderate than in 2009. The moderation in 
government consumption reß ected consolidation 
efforts aimed at limiting the deterioration of 
government budget balances. Annual growth in total Þ xed investment has been 
on the rise, reaching a positive Þ gure in the third 
quarter of 2010. Firms returned to expansion plans, given better business prospects, improving 
order books and easier access to Þ nancing. This notwithstanding, the speed of the recovery 
in investment has been rather limited. Growth in 
construction investment was muted, reß ecting housing market adjustments in a number of 
euro area countries, following the steep declines in house prices seen over the 2009 recession. 
Non-construction investment remained subdued, 
as this component was constrained by ongoing 
balance sheet restructuring and a slow increase 
in capacity utilisation.Inventories played a prominent role in explaining the improvement in real GDP growth 
in the Þ rst half of 2010. They contributed to the quarterly rise in GDP in the Þ rst and second 
quarters of 2010 by an estimated 0.7 and 
0.4 percentage point respectively. Behind the 
activity observed in the Þ rst half of 2010 were 
decisions by businesses to destock more slowly 
than in 2009, with the impact being felt in faster 
deliveries along the supply chain. National 
accounts data suggest that the improvement in the overall implications for household saving rates would have depended on how households 
viewed the longer-term implications of government debt Þ nancing. The steep increase in 
government debt levels, as well as projections implying that deÞ cits would remain high for a 
sustained period, may have heightened household concerns about the Þ scal outlook. Future 
Þ scal consolidation, either through tax increases or reduced government expenditure, affects household 
income in the years ahead, which may have encouraged households to build up their savings in 
advance. Such concerns may have been particularly prevalent during the periods of heightened 
uncertainty about sovereign debt in Þ nancial markets in early 2010 and also later in the year, 
perhaps pushing saving levels higher than they might otherwise have been. The outlook for household saving in the euro areaFollowing the declines in household saving during 2010, further modest falls in the euro area household saving ratio are expected in the future, with households being prompted to pare 
down their precautionary savings as the economic recovery gains traction and the labour market 
continues to improve.Nevertheless, uncertainty about the course of household saving remains high. On the downside, a faster than expected recovery might improve conÞ dence, leading households to increase their 
consumption and reduce the amount they save. However, it is also possible that the level of 
household saving could remain persistently higher than before the downturn, if the crisis has 
caused households to worry more than before about income prospects or pushed them to further 
rebuild balance sheets and reduce their debt levels Œ the adjustment over the past three years 
notwithstanding. In addition, following the bursting of bubbles in some asset markets, households 
may now have a less optimistic assessment of future wealth developments. Finally, savings may 
remain high if households are concerned about the implications for their future tax burden of 
the high levels of government debt and the large government deÞ cits. Such concerns highlight how important it is that euro area governments provide credible Þ scal consolidation strategies to 
correct the large Þ scal imbalances that built up during the recession.
66ECBAnnual Report
2010inventories lost considerable momentum in the third quarter of the year, when this component 
of aggregate demand contributed 0.1 percentage 
point to quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth.Euro area exports of goods and services increased sharply, by 11.3% in the year to the 
third quarter of 2010, reversing a large fraction 
of the losses incurred in 2009. This increase 
was supported by both intra and extra-euro 
area trade, and can be traced back to the strong 
recovery in levels of global activity as the 
tensions arising from the Þ nancial crisis eased. 
Given that imports also increased sharply, 
the overall contribution to quarterly GDP 
growth from net exports turned out to be 
slightly negative over the Þ rst three quarters 
of 2010, with small positive contributions 
registered in both the second and third 
quarters. The increase in imports and exports 
was relatively broad-based across major 
product categories, with intermediate inputs 
displaying particularly large percentage rises. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION RECOVEREDTaking a sectoral perspective, the expansion in 
output was predominantly driven by industrial 
activity, with value added in industry (excluding 
construction) rising by 5.2% in the year to 
the third quarter of 2010, compared with an 
increase of 1.7% for market-related services and 
a decline of 3.1% for construction in the same 
period. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing 
sector increased to 76.8% in 2010 as a whole 
(according to survey data). Output of intermediate goods recovered 
particularly sharply in reaction to the slower 

speed of destocking along the supply chain. 

Production of capital goods also rose sharply, 

beneÞ ting from stronger external demand and, 
to a lesser extent, improving domestic economic 

prospects (see Chart 32). Construction output 

continued to contract, owing to housing market 

adjustments in a number of euro area countries. 

Overall, adverse developments in the residential 

construction sector have more than outweighed 
the contribution of infrastructure projects put 

forward by governments. 
LABOUR MARKET CONDITIONS EVENTUALLY 

STABILISEDFollowing a sharp deterioration in 2009, 
conditions in the euro area labour market began 
to stabilise in the course of 2010 as employment 
stopped falling and the rise in unemployment 
rates lost momentum. Euro area employment (measured in terms 
of the number of persons employed) was, on 

average, ß at in the 
Þ rst three quarters of 2010, 
marking a considerable improvement from 

the fall of 1.8% in 2009 (see Table 4). During 

the 2009 recession, many Þ rms preferred 
to hoard labour rather than face the costs 

(in terms of human capital lost or severance 

pay) associated with dismissing workers. 

Since a large proportion of the employment 

adjustment seen in 2009 took the form of cuts 

in the number of hours worked per person, the 

improvement over 2010 was greater in terms 

of total hours worked than the number of

recent labour market developments in the euro 

area with those in the United States). Labour 

productivity rose strongly (per hour worked, 

and even more so per person), contributing to 

a rise in the proÞ tability of businesses in the 
context of muted wage developments.From a sectoral perspective, data for persons employed up to the third quarter of 2010 
indicate that employment gains in 2010 took 
place in some services activities, namely public 
administration and market-related services 
relating to Þ nance and business. These gains 
were offset by employment losses in agricultural 
activities, industry and market services 
associated with trade and transport. Among 
industrial activities, the most severely affected 
sector was construction.The unemployment rate averaged 10.0% in 2010, up from 9.4% in 2009, with the 
monthly increases in this indicator having 
lost momentum since the second quarter of 
the year. Developments in the unemployment 
rate were fairly similar throughout the euro 
area, if subject to a number of country-speciÞ c features. Moreover, the average monthly rise 
in the number of unemployed persons fell 
markedly from the Þ gures registered in 2009 
(see Chart 33).Chart 33 Unemployment(monthly data; seasonally adjusted)-2.0-1.5

2010Box 7RECENT LABOUR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EURO AREA AND THE UNITED STATES: THE MAIN 
DIFFERENCES AND A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVEThe latest recession, which was characterised by a severe slowdown in economic activity 
relative to previous recessions, signiÞ cantly affected labour markets on both sides of the 
Atlantic. Job losses were spread across a number of sectors of the economy, some of which, 
such as construction and Þ nancial services, were hit particularly hard in both the euro area and 
the United States. Total hours worked declined sharply in both economic areas, although in the 
United States a signiÞ cant part of the adjustment took place via job shedding, whereas in the 
euro area a reduction in the average number of hours worked per week played a relatively major 
role.1 While labour force participation remained fairly stable in the euro area, owing to labour hoarding, it declined markedly in the United States, as many workers who lost their jobs have 
left the labour market, reß ecting the lack of employment opportunities. 
This box reviews recent labour market developments in the euro area and the United States by 
discussing the evolution of selected indicators in the course of the recent recession, compared 
with previous downturns since the early 1970s and the current recovery. Strong adjustment in employment during 
the recession During the recent recession, euro area 
employment fell by around 2.7 million 
(see the chart), or 0.8% (2.1% in terms of 
total hours), as shown in the table. This was associated with a 3.0% decline in 
real GDP,2 which implies an elasticity of around 0.25 (or 0.7 in terms of hours). 
In other words, for each percentage point 
drop in GDP, employment in the euro area 
fell by 0.25 percentage point. The elasticity 
of employment to GDP for the euro area 
aggregate masks considerable heterogeneity 
across countries, with Spain and Germany 
at the two ends of the spectrum, having an 
elasticity of 2.2 and 0.1 respectively.3 Job losses persisted in the euro area, even as the economy 
started to recover, until the end of 2009. 
The impact of the downturn on employment 1 See the box entitled ﬁA comparison of employment developments in the euro area and the United Statesﬂ,

2010was signiÞ cantly stronger in the United States, where the level of employment (measured as 
civilian employment) declined by about 5.9 million in the course of the recession.4 The 2.8% decline in employment in the United States (4.2% in total hours) was associated with a 2.7% decline in GDP, which translated into an elasticity of employment to changes in output of 1 
(1.5 in terms of hours).Compared with previous recessions since the early 1970s, the elasticity of employment to output was broadly in line with historical standards in the United States, but it turned out to be much lower 
in the euro area. In terms of hours worked, it was broadly comparable with previous recessions in 
the United States and, to a lesser extent, the euro area. The change in the employment response in 
the euro area partly reß ects the very extensive use of shorter working hours schemes instituted in 
a number of euro area countries in a direct attempt to safeguard employment.The recent recession has, however, had an impact on the labour market beyond the fall in employment. The euro area unemployment rate rose from 7.2% in the Þ rst quarter of 2008 
to 9.3% at the end of the downturn in the second quarter of 2009, its highest level since the 
third quarter of 1998. It increased even more dramatically in the United States, by around 
5 percentage points from peak to trough, reaching 9.5% in the second quarter of 2009. In addition, 
while the labour force participation rate in the euro area was fairly stable by historical standards, 
in the United States it declined signiÞ cantly more than in previous recessions, suggesting that 
the rate of unemployment may understate the degree of slack in the labour market. Moreover, 
the sustained increase in unemployment translated into an increase in the share of total 4 The corresponding

70ECBAnnual Report
2010unemployment held by those unemployed for longer than six months to levels which are exceptionally high by US standards, i.e. around 30% of the total number of unemployed. 
The share held by long-term unemployment has historically been much higher in the euro area 
than in the United States, but remained broadly unchanged in the recent recession at almost 
59%. Over the recent recession, unit labour costs rose by 4.4% in the euro area (as, owing to 
labour hoarding, labour costs did not decrease as much as value added), a much faster pace 
than the 1.7% recorded for the United States, where employment downsizing led to a surge in 
productivity and labour cost growth slowed substantially.5 Modest employment gains at the start of the recoveryAlthough it is too early to pass judgement on the current recovery from a labour market perspective, 
it is nevertheless interesting to note some characteristic features of the ongoing adjustments. 
As expected, given the typically lagged response of the labour market to a rise in economic activity, 
the deterioration in the performance of the euro area labour market has, to some extent, continued 
in the current recovery. Employment fell by 3.7 million between the second quarter of 2008 and 
the end of 2009. According to data from the EU Labour Force Survey, euro area unemployment 
fell to 9.8% of the total labour force in the third quarter of 2010, slightly below the peak observed 
in the Þ rst quarter of the year. Other signs of improvement emerging in the euro area are the 
positive growth in hours worked, as well as the reversal of the rise in unit labour costs. The US 
labour market situation started to improve at the beginning of 2010 (six months after the start of 
the recovery), with modest gains in employment and a slight decline in the unemployment rate.The improvement in the labour markets is also reß ected in developments in total hours worked, both in the euro area and the United States (see the table). The unemployment rate in the United States did not decline until the Þ rst quarter of 2010, and has since remained broadly stable. 
By contrast, it has continued to increase in the euro area, albeit at a slower pace in recent quarters. 
This is indicative of the slow improvement in the labour market, in which job creation is currently 
not sufÞ ciently strong to reduce the number of unemployed persons. Another aspect pointing to the sluggishness of the labour market recovery is the fact that the labour force participation rate 
has remained low. This is especially true in the United States, although there have been signs of 
stabilisation in the last few months. At the same time, the share of total unemployment held by 
those out of work for over six months has continued to grow, reaching historically high levels in 
both the euro area and the United States (65% and just under 45% respectively Œ see the table). 
In both cases, while the origin of this rise is mainly seen as cyclical, it implies a deterioration in 
human capital, which may increase structural unemployment.Overall, there have been some differences between labour market developments in the euro area and those in the United States. Firstly, although the decline in activity was more marked 
in the euro area than in the United States, the adjustment in the US labour market has been 
more pronounced. With regard to labour input in particular, the adjustment in the euro area was 
more to do with the number of hours worked per person than the number of persons employed Œ 
partly due to the extensive use of shorter working hours schemes Œ while in the United States 
it was, in relative terms, mainly accounted for by changes in the number of persons employed. 
Secondly, given the magnitude of the fall in output, the adjustment in the euro area can be seen as 
less marked than that observed in previous recessions, particularly regarding employment losses. 5 For a detailed comparison of wage developments in the euro area and the United States, see the box entitled ﬁWage developments in

20102.5 FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS
STABILISATION OF EURO AREA GOVERNMENT 
DEFICIT IN 2010The shock of the recent Þ nancial and economic 
crisis resulted in sharp increases in government 
deÞ cit-to-GDP and public debt-to-GDP ratios 
and, in 2010, Þ nancial market participants 
questioned the sustainability of public Þ nances in some euro area countries. In response 
to the unfolding sovereign debt crisis and 
negative spillover effects, the most affected 
countries implemented additional consolidation 
and structural reform measures to restore 
credibility. The crisis showed that ensuring 
sound public Þ nances is a prerequisite for 
overall macroeconomic and Þ nancial stability. 
Following two years of sharp deterioration in 

budgetary positions, the aggregate government 

deÞ cit for the euro area stabilised in 2010, although 
deÞ cit levels varied greatly among countries. 
According to the European Commission™s 

autumn economic forecast, published on 

29 November 2010, the euro area average general 

government deÞ cit ratio in 2010 was unchanged 
from 2009 at 6.3% of GDP (see Table 5). 

The stabilisation of the budget deÞ cit was in 
part driven by a rebound in government revenue 

growth in a context of stabilising macroeconomic 

conditions, following the strong decline in 

revenues in 2009. At the same time, growth 

in government expenditure slowed down, as 

the phasing-out of Þ scal stimulus measures 
implemented since end-2008 and new Þ scal 
consolidation measures offset the still relatively 
strong growth in social payments, capital transfers 

and interest payments. The expenditure restraint 

was particularly pronounced in government 

investment and compensation of government 

employees, with cuts in public employment as 

well as wage freezes or cuts in several countries. 

In terms of ratios to GDP, both total government 

revenue and total government expenditure were 

broadly unchanged from 2009, at 44.4% and 

50.8% respectively. 
The Commission™s autumn 2010 Þ scal forecasts 
are, for most countries, more favourable than 
the estimates presented in the updated stability 

programmes, which were submitted between 

December 2009 and March 2010. The latter 

pointed to a higher deÞ cit for the euro area as 
a whole, amounting to 6.6% of GDP in 2010 

against 6.3% presented by the Commission 

(see Table 5). In many cases, the more favourable 

forecasts of the Commission reß ect stronger than 
previously expected economic growth feeding into 

higher tax receipts, while in the case of Portugal 

the fulÞ lment of the new government target is 
mainly attributable to a sizeable one-off measure, 

namely a transfer of the Portugal Telecom pension 

fund to the civil servants™ pension system. 
However, for some countries, the European Commission deÞ cit forecasts are substantially 
higher than expected in the stability programmes 
or in the governments™ updated targets. 
This is the case for Slovakia, owing to lower 
than expected revenues, but also for Greece and 
Ireland, which faced particularly large budgetary 
imbalances in 2010.By contrast, the US labour market has shown much larger declines in labour force participation 
and signiÞ cant increases in the duration of unemployment, while employment losses were 
broadly in line with previous recessions, after taking into account the depth of the fall in activity. 
Despite a less pronounced deterioration in the labour market, the proportion of those unemployed 
who have been out of work for more than six months has now reached exceptionally high levels 
in the euro area, which calls for an effective policy response. Unless this is addressed in a timely 
manner by active labour market policies and measures to promote lifelong learning, the risk of 
human capital erosion associated with long spells of unemployment may lead to an increase in 
structural unemployment. This would make it difÞ cult to bring unemployment back down to 
pre-recession levels as the recovery matures.72ECBAnnual Report
2010In Greece, persistent government deÞ cits 
and high debt, misreporting of Þ scal data up 
until 2009, as well as a postponement of much 
needed economic and social reform, severely 

undermined the credibility of the authorities. 

Greece increasingly faced rising borrowing costs 

and severe funding difÞ culties and, at the end of 
April, the government had to request Þ nancial 
support from the euro area countries and the 
IMF. This support was granted subject to strong 

conditionality under an ambitious economic, 

Þ nancial, Þ scal and public governance reform 
programme. Following a strong start, including 

major Þ scal adjustment as well as pension and 
labour market reforms, several challenges arose 

in the programme implementation in the second 

half of the year and some structural reforms 

experienced delays. In particular, the carry-over

2010effect of the statistical upward revision of 
the 2009 government deÞ cit, as well as revenue 
shortfalls and an accumulation of arrears by 

social security funds, is likely to have led to a 

higher than targeted 2010 government deÞ cit 
in ESA 95 terms. For 2011 the authorities have 

adopted additional consolidation measures to 

fully compensate for the ground lost in 2010 and, 

as such, the programme remains broadly on track. 

However, additional measures in the amount of 

around 6% of GDP still need to be speciÞ ed for 
subsequent years to meet the objective of reducing 

the government deÞ cit to below 3% of GDP by 
2014. Moreover, further ambitious efforts in the 

area of structural reforms are necessary. 
In Ireland, the wide-ranging Þ scal consolidation 
measures adopted by the government could not halt the deterioration of the Þ scal situation, 
which reß ects a combination of a weak 
underlying Þ scal position, severe structural 
problems in the banking sector and a strong 
exposure of public Þ nances to the 
Þ nancial sector. The very large deÞ cit increase was partly 
caused by a steep decline in tax revenues on 
account of severely worsened cyclical conditions, 
a large fall in domestic demand and a reversal 
of past property-related tax revenue windfalls following the bursting of the housing bubble. 
In addition, exceptional government assistance to 
the banking sector drove the government deÞ cit to above 30% of GDP. As market conÞ dence declined, the Irish government had to apply, in 
November, for EU-IMF Þ nancial assistance, 
subject to strong policy conditionality. 
The associated adjustment programme is based 
on a four-year Þ scal consolidation and structural 
reform plan, including a major restructuring of 
the banking sector. The objective is to reduce the 
government deÞ cit to below 3% of GDP by 2015 
and to restore conÞ dence in the sustainability of 
public Þ nances in Ireland. 
Ultimately, nearly all euro area countries 

recorded a deÞ cit above the 3% of GDP 
reference value in 2010. By the end of 2010, 

15 euro area countries were subject to an excessive 

deÞ cit procedure, with deadlines for reducing 
deÞ cit ratios to below the reference value of 3% 
of GDP ranging from 2011 to 2015 (see Table 6). 
The euro area government debt ratio again 
rose considerably in 2010, albeit at a slower 

pace than in 2009. According to the European 

Commission™s autumn 2010 forecast, the euro 

area average government debt-to-GDP ratio

74ECBAnnual Report
2010increased from 79.2% in 2009 to 84.2% in 2010, 
as a consequence mainly of high deÞ cits and 
to a lesser extent of the support provided to the 

Þ nancial sector and Greece. Unlike in previous 
years, in 2010 the increase in the debt ratio 

was less than that implied by the level of the 

deÞ cit. The reason for this was that stock-
ß ow 
adjustments, which, although lower, were still 

increasing the level of debt, were more than offset 

by the impact of nominal GDP growth on the 

denominator. That said, debt ratios were above 

the reference value of 60% of GDP at the end of 

2010 in 12 out of 16 euro area countries, and well 

above 100% of GDP in Greece and Italy.Despite the improvement in the Þ scal outlook 
compared with earlier expectations for a number of countries, the euro area Þ scal situation 
remains precarious. This has contributed to 
heightened tensions on the government bond 
markets. Concerns in the Þ nancial markets 
as reß ected in government bond yields even 
intensiÞ ed in 2010 and early 2011 in the case 
of some countries experiencing particularly 
adverse Þ scal developments (see Section 2.2 of 
Chapter 1 for an analysis of government bond 
market developments). It is particularly difÞ cult to distinguish between 
the cyclical and structural factors underlying the budgetary developments because of 
uncertainty regarding the identiÞ cation of trend 
growth and the output gap in real time. Despite 
this uncertainty, according to the European 
Commission, the cyclical component of the 
deÞ cit improved in 2010 for the 
Þ rst time since 
2007. The Þ scal stance for the euro area, in 
terms of the change in the cyclically adjusted 
primary budget balance (corrected for the 
exceptional bank recapitalisation measures in 
Ireland), is assessed to have been broadly neutral 
in 2010, thereby initiating a reversal from the 
expansionary stance in 2008-09 to an expected 
tightening in 2011.FISCAL CONSOLIDATION EXPECTED IN 2011 
In 2011 some improvement is expected in the 
euro area Þ scal situation, though it is anticipated 
that the deÞ cit will remain elevated. According 
to the European Commission™s autumn 2010 
economic forecasts, the average general 
government deÞ cit ratio in the euro area will 
decline by 1.8 percentage points to 4.6% of GDP 
(see Chart 34). The euro area average revenue 
ratio is projected to increase by 0.4 percentage 
point of GDP, whereas the primary expenditure 
ratio is anticipated to fall by 1.5 percentage 
points of GDP, reß ecting mainly consolidation 
measures, and the euro area average interest 
expenditure ratio should rise by 0.1 percentage 
point of GDP. An overall improvement in the 
euro area budgetary position should result mainly 
from a tightening of the Þ scal stance, while the 
impact of the economic cycle is judged likely to 
be favourable but small. Despite the expected 
improvement in the aggregate budgetary 
position, few euro area countries Œ notably 
Germany, Luxembourg, Malta and Finland Œ are 
expected to have government deÞ cits at or below 
the reference value of 3% of GDP in 2011. 
The average government debt ratio in the euro 
area is projected to continue to rise in 2011, by 
2.4 percentage points, to 86.5% of GDP, with

debt ratio below 100% of GDP in 2011.COMMITMENT TO FISCAL CONSOLIDATION 

ESSENTIALOn account of the still precarious Þ scal situation 
in a number of countries, the commitment 
to Þ scal consolidation needs to be sustained. 
The Þ scal consolidation set out in 2011 budgets is a Þ rst step in the right direction. However, the 
scale of the present Þ scal challenges requires 
an ambitious multi-year consolidation effort 
in most countries. Not least given the sharp 
increase in expenditure ratios during the crisis, 
a strong emphasis on structural expenditure 
cuts, including a systematic reassessment of the scope of public spending and the quality 
of public Þ nances, appears warranted in many 
countries. This is all the more necessary in the 
light of the current severe Þ scal imbalances: 
high sovereign debt ratios and the prospect of 
a lower trend growth rate make more acute 
the budgetary risks related to any further bank 
restructuring and the projected future costs of 
population ageing associated with unfunded 
public pension systems and healthcare. 
A credible and comprehensive reform strategy 
also helps to sustain market conÞ dence, which 
could be particularly important in countries with 
vulnerable Þ scal positions. Moreover, such a 
strategy is likely to have a favourable impact 
on Þ nancing conditions in the longer run that 
will offset the short-term costs in terms of lower 
economic growth (see Box 8).Box 8MACROECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF FISCAL CONSOLIDATION 
Government deÞ cit-to-GDP and debt-to-GDP ratios have increased signi
Þ cantly during the 
economic and Þ nancial crisis. Part of this increase is due to the automatic cyclical response 
of government revenue and spending to macroeconomic developments and to other transitory 
factors, such as temporary Þ scal stimulus measures or government transfers to shore up the 
banking sector. However, the crisis has led to a substantial downward revision of most estimates 
of potential output, along with some losses in tax revenues (e.g. linked to property transactions), 
which may be viewed as permanent. For this reason, the bulk of the government deÞ cits built 
up during the crisis should be considered as structural. This implies that substantial Þ scal consolidation in the coming years is needed to put public Þ nances on a sustainable footing. 
It is widely accepted that Þ scal consolidation is bene
Þ cial for economic growth in the long 
run. A reduction in government Þ nancing needs leads to lower long-term interest rates, thereby 
improving the Þ nancing conditions of the private sector and stimulating productive investment. 
For the government, a lower level of debt and associated interest payments frees up resources to 
reduce distortionary taxes and Þ nance more productive expenditure. Moreover, with sound 
Þ scal positions, households and Þ rms can have con
Þ dence in the government™s ability to help attenuate 
economic ß uctuations through the operation of automatic stabilisers. Empirical studies across a 
wide range of industrial countries and time periods provide evidence of the growth-inhibiting 
effects of high government debt.1 1 The correlation between high debt and lower growth is established for a very long time period by Reinhart, C.M. and Rogoff, K
.S., ﬁGrowth in a time of debtﬂ, Working Paper Series, No 15639, National Bureau of Economic Research, 2010. For the euro area, econometric evidence is presented by Checherita, C. and Rother, P., ﬁThe impact of high and growing debt on economic growth: an empirical investigation for the euro areaﬂ, Working Paper Series, No 1237, ECB, 2010.76ECBAnnual Report
2010The Þ scal policy provisions of the Treaty and the 
Stability and Growth Pact are essential to guide policy-makers and underpin the trust of the public 
and of Þ nancial markets in the 
Þ scal policies of 
EMU. Governments must strictly adhere to the deadlines and targets set in ECOFIN Council 
recommendations, implementing all the planned 
measures and being prepared to take additional 
measures to meet targets if necessary. In this 
regard, the measures that have been announced By contrast, Þ scal consolidation is usually characterised as having a dampening effect on 
economic growth in the short run. Cuts in government consumption and investment directly 
reduce aggregate spending, while higher taxes and lower government transfers reduce the 
disposable income of households and Þ rms. Most empirical evidence points to tax and spending 
multipliers which are positive in the short to medium run, albeit declining over time. This is also 
reß ected in the standard structural economic models used to analyse the economy and make 
economic predictions for the short to medium term.2 However, under certain circumstances Œ particularly when Þ scal tightening implies moving from a (near) unsustainable to a (more) 
sustainable Þ scal position Œ it is possible that the traditional short-run ﬁKeynesianﬂ effects 
of Þ scal consolidation are signi
Þ cantly dampened or even reversed. The theoretical case for 
ﬁnon-Keynesianﬂ effects in the short run rests on the idea that spending cuts or tax increases may 
lead to an immediate offsetting increase in private consumption and investment if they give rise 
to the expectation of lower taxes Œ and thus higher disposable income Œ in future. This idea is 
closely related to the theory of ﬁRicardian equivalenceﬂ, according to which a rational private 
sector should internalise the government™s budget constraint. Notwithstanding the difÞ culties involved in disentangling the impact of 
Þ scal policy on the 
economy from other factors, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that non-Keynesian effects are dominant in normal economic times. The evidence nonetheless suggests that any 
negative short-run effects of Þ scal consolidation on economic growth are likely to be much 
more muted when: i) the starting Þ scal position is particularly precarious (giving rise to 
Þ nancial market concerns and high risk premia), ii) the private sector does not face credit constraints 
(so households and Þ rms are able to smooth their consumption and investment over time), 
and iii) a favourable impact of Þ scal consolidation on in
ß ation Œ and in
ß ation expectations Œ 
allows for a more accommodative monetary (and exchange rate) policy. However, empirical work based on data samples covering more ﬁbenignﬂ periods are unlikely to be a good guide for considering the impact of Þ scal consolidation in the wake of a sovereign debt crisis.3 A loss of conÞ dence in public 
Þ nances would affect the holders of government debt, 
such as banks, pension funds and individual investors, and thereby undermine Þ nancial stability 
and the outlook for the real economy. In these circumstances, it is simply not a viable option not 
to announce and start to implement signiÞ cant Þ scal adjustment. The counterfactual approach 
of inaction in periods of high Þ scal stress is not a sustainable alternative, since 
Þ nancial market 
tensions would escalate, in all likelihood providing a much worse growth outcome than that 
resulting from Þ scal consolidation. Indeed, postponing necessary 
Þ scal consolidation only serves 
to amplify difÞ culties, possibly entailing a need for untimely harsh consolidation in the context 
of foregone opportunities to create needed Þ scal space.

2010but not yet sufÞ ciently speci
Þ ed should be 
presented in more detail. Moreover, countries with an improved macroeconomic environment 
should use the opportunity to correct excessive 
deÞ cits before the deadlines. Subsequently, they 
should strive to move quickly towards their 
medium-term budgetary objectives, to create the 
Þ scal space needed to tackle known challenges 
and also be well-positioned to cope with any 
unforeseen budgetary deterioration. A strong political commitment to improve the sustainability of public Þ nances, along with 
structural reforms addressing macroeconomic 
imbalances and weaknesses in the banking 
sector, is essential, not least because it provides 
an anchor for expectations. In the current 
context of heightened euro area sovereign 
strains, with the risk of spillover effects, it is 
essential that all countries attain and maintain 
sound Þ scal positions to avoid any additional 
risks to Þ nancing conditions.
2.6 EXCHANGE RATES AND BALANCE 
OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
THE EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE EURO 

DECLINED DURING THE YEARExchange rate developments in 2010 were to a 

large extent shaped by the economic recovery, 

Þ scal conditions and monetary policy around the 
world. Developments were somewhat volatile 

in many advanced economies, as the economic 

recovery was still vulnerable and dependent on the 

support of Þ scal and monetary policies. In the 
Þ rst 
half of the year the euro depreciated against several 

major currencies (see Chart 35), reß ecting rising 
concerns about the sovereign debt situation in 

some euro area countries. This uncertainty also 

resulted in an increase in the implied volatility of 

the euro exchange rate against major currencies 

in May and June (see Chart 35). In the second 

half of 2010 the euro rebounded, amid some 

volatility, owing mostly to the alleviation of 

concerns about sovereign debt, as well as more 

positive than expected macroeconomic news 

for the euro area. The overall appreciation 
was driven mainly by developments in the 

USD/EUR exchange rate. In the course of 2010 

the euro depreciated by 8.2% in effective terms as 

measured against the currencies of 20 of the euro

2010area™s important trading partners (see Chart 36). 
As a consequence, the average level of the nominal 

effective exchange rate in 2010 was 6.3% lower 

compared with 2009. In 2010 the euro stood 5.5% 

higher than the historical average since 1999. 
On 31 December 2010 the euro traded at 
USD 1.34, 7.3% lower than at the beginning of 

2010 and 4.2% weaker than its 2009 average. 

The depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the 

US dollar in the Þ rst half of 2010 was driven 
by a stronger macroeconomic recovery in the 

United States than in the euro area in early 2010. 

In the second half of 2010 the euro strengthened 

against the US dollar in response to the approval 

by the US authorities of an additional economic 

stimulus.In the Þ rst half of 2010 the euro also continued 
to depreciate vis-à-vis the Japanese yen, completely reversing its appreciation in 2009 
(see Chart 35). Throughout the remainder 
of 2010 the bilateral JPY/EUR exchange 
rate ß uctuated within a rather narrow range, 
with the euro trading between JPY 105 and 
JPY 115. On 31 December 2010 the euro 
traded at JPY 108.65, 18.4% lower than at the 
beginning of the year and 16.7% below its 
average for 2009. Volatility in the JPY/EUR 
exchange rate increased sharply in May and 
June 2010, before declining in the second half 
of 2010. In 2010 the euro depreciated against the pound sterling by 3.1%, from GBP 0.89 to GBP 0.86. 
The euro depreciated against the pound sterling 
in the Þ rst half of 2010 amid market concerns 
over Þ scal sustainability in some euro area 
countries. In the second half of the year the euro 
recovered some of the earlier losses. By the end 
of 2010 the euro bilateral exchange rate against 
the pound sterling was still above its historical 
average since 1999, owing to the appreciation 
that occurred in 2008 and early 2009.In 2010 the euro depreciated against the Swiss franc by 15.7%. Until June 2010 the depreciation 
was moderated as a result of interventions by the 
Swiss National Bank. In the second half of 2010 the euro further depreciated against the Swiss 
franc signiÞ cantly, amid some volatility. 
Between the beginning of the year and 
31 December 2010 the euro depreciated against 
the Canadian dollar (by 11.9%), the Australian 
dollar (by 17.9%) and the Norwegian krone 
(by 6.0%), mainly owing to positive interest rate 
differentials vis-à-vis the euro area. The euro 
also depreciated against the Asian currencies that 
are linked to the US dollar, namely the Chinese 
renminbi (by 10.3%) and the Hong Kong dollar 
(by 7.0%). The euro also depreciated vis-à-vis 
the Korean won (by 10.7%). The real effective exchange rate of the euro based 
on different cost and price measures declined 

in the Þ rst half of 2010 and stabilised thereafter 
(see Chart 36). By the end of 2010 the values of 

the real effective exchange rates were very close 

to their historical averages since 1999. The real 

effective CPI-deß ated exchange rate was, on 
average, 6.9% weaker in 2010 than in 2009.Chart 36 Euro nominal and real effective

2010THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT INCREASED 
SLIGHTLY IN 2010 
In 2010 the current account of the euro area 
recorded a deÞ cit of •56.4 billion (or 0.6% of 
euro area GDP), compared with a deÞ cit of 
•51.4 billion in 2009. These developments 
resulted from a decrease in the deÞ cit in the 
income balance of •18.6 billion, while the trade 
balance in services remained somewhat stable 
(see Chart 37). However, the trade balance in 
goods worsened during 2010, counterbalancing 
the improvement in the income balance. After 
the rebound in trade in early 2009 and the 
improvement in the trade balance over 2009, the 
goods balance continued to register a surplus 
in 2010 that was •16.2 billion lower than the 
surplus recorded in 2009. Finally, the deÞ cit in the current transfers balance deteriorated by 
•8.2 billion in 2010. Year-on-year growth rates in euro area goods exports followed global trends in trade. They 
reached a peak in the Þ rst half of 2010 and 
then gradually decelerated. The most important 
driver of the export expansion in the Þ rst half of 
the year was the strong foreign import demand 
owing to temporary factors such as Þ scal policy 
stimuli and the inventory cycle. However, the 
global slowdown in economic activity and the 
gradual fading-out of these temporary factors 
in the second half of 2010 contributed to the 
moderation of export growth rates. The growth 
in euro area exports continued to be supported 
by exports to Asia and OPEC, which continued 
to rise throughout the year (see Chart 38). 
While exports to the United States and the 
United Kingdom rose in the Þ rst quarter 
of 2010, they remained subdued thereafter. 
Meanwhile, the depreciation of the euro and 
the associated positive impact on euro area 
export price competitiveness in 2010 somewhat 
boosted foreign demand.Developments in euro area goods imports in 2010 followed a similar path to those 
observed for exports. Year-on-year growth in 
import volumes continued to increase, peaking 
in the second quarter and moderating in the 
third quarter of 2010. This reß ected subdued

2010developments in euro area domestic demand over the second half of the year. The reliance of 
euro area exports on imported inputs continued 
to boost euro area imports. Rising import prices 
also contributed to the increase in import values 
throughout the year. The higher import prices 
were partly due to the increase in oil prices seen 
throughout the year, which contributed to a 
widening of the oil trade deÞ cit to •169.6 billion 
in the 12-month period to November 2010, well 
above the level of •132.1 billion registered a 
year earlier. NET INFLOWS IN COMBINED DIRECT 

AND PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT DECLINED 

MARKEDLY IN 2010In the Þ nancial account, the euro area experienced 
net inß ows of •111.2 billion in combined direct 
and portfolio investment in 2010, compared 
with net inß ows of •190.3 billion a year earlier. 
This reduction was primarily the result of 
a signiÞ cant decline in net in
ß ows in debt 
instruments (by •72.9 billion) and, to a lesser 
extent, of an increase in net outß ows in foreign 
direct investment (FDI) (by •11.4 billion). This 
was partly offset by higher net inß ows in equity 
instruments (by •5.1 billion; see Chart 39).As regards portfolio investment, quarterly 
developments were very volatile in 2010, 

with market sentiment swinging considerably. 

Following some signs of a rebound in risk 

appetite and a subsequent revival of cross-border 

portfolio equity transactions in the Þ rst quarter 
of 2010, the reintensiÞ cation of 
Þ nancial market 
tensions in May appeared to have caused a 

renewed increase in risk aversion on the part of 

investors. While euro area residents liquidated 

foreign equity positions and repatriated funds, 

non-euro area residents continued to invest in 

euro area portfolio instruments, resulting overall 

in a strong increase in net inß ows in portfolio 
investment in the second quarter of 2010 

(see Chart 40). In the second half of 2010 the 

balance in portfolio investment shifted from 

net outß ows in the third quarter to net in
ß ows 
in the fourth quarter. This mainly reß ected 
developments in bonds and notes. Amid market

euro area residents increased their investment in 

foreign bonds and notes. As Þ nancial tensions 
eased, non-residents resumed their purchases 

of euro area bonds in the fourth quarter. 

At the same time, the euro area recorded net 

inß ows in equities in the second half of 2010, 
amid increased interest in euro area equities by 

foreign investors.Direct investment activity remained relatively subdued in 2010 as both euro area and foreign 
companies decreased their investment in equity 
capital. Higher net outß ows in direct investment 
in 2010 mainly reß ected developments in other

their ß ows of loans to their foreign af
Þ liates, foreign companies repatriated funds.Data on the international investment position of the euro area vis-à-vis the rest of the world, 
available up to the third quarter of 2010, indicate 
that the euro area recorded net liabilities of

20103 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS
IN NON-EURO AREA EU MEMBER STATES5ECONOMIC ACTIVITY In most non-euro area EU Member States output recovered in 2010 after a signiÞ cant contraction in 2009, but with some volatility in 
the growth proÞ le and signi
Þ cant cross-country 
differences (see Table 7). The recovery was 
supported mainly by exports, on the back of 
robust external demand, and the rebuilding of 
inventories after a signiÞ cant drain on inventory 
levels in 2009. At the same time, domestic 
demand remained subdued in most countries, 
in spite of a marked improvement in conÞ dence indicators. Weak domestic demand was a 
consequence of ongoing economic adjustment 
in the private sector, and in some countries also 
in the public sector. In the countries that 
had entered the recession period following 
an unsustainable boom, domestic demand 
continued to contract even in recent quarters, 
reß ecting a prolonged economic adjustment. 
Looking at the main components of domestic 
demand, private consumption remained 
subdued in most countries, reß ecting to some 
extent weak labour market conditions and credit 
growth. Unemployment rates were in many 
countries higher than in 2009, although in some 
countries the improvement in overall economic 
activity brought a rebound in employment from the second quarter of 2010. There were marked 
differences in the labour market performances 
of different sectors. In general, export-oriented 
sectors saw much greater labour demand, 
more favourable developments in employment 
Þ gures and stronger wage dynamics. The 
growth of credit to the private sector continued 
to be relatively weak in most non-euro area 
EU countries, reß ecting both tight supply and 
low demand. Capacity utilisation remained 
low, in particular in the non-tradable sectors, 
even though it increased strongly in the export 
sectors of many countries. Investment growth 
was in general subdued or in some countries 
even sharply negative, pointing to the ongoing 
adjustment in housing markets and a decline 
in the construction sector. In some countries 
the short-term impact of an ongoing Þ scal adjustment contributed to the low growth of 
domestic demand. Among the non-euro area EU Member States real GDP growth was particularly strong in the 
countries, such as Poland and Sweden, that had 
entered the recession with relatively small current 
account imbalances compared with most other This section covers EU countries that did not form part of the 5 euro area in 2010.Table 7 Real GDP growth in the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area(annual percentage changes)20062007200820092010

2010non-euro area EU countries. Some countries that had experienced very pronounced downturns 
in economic activity in 2009 also saw a strong 
rebound. The Baltic economies recovered after 
registering the most sizeable declines in activity 
of all EU countries in 2009. Their recovery 
was mainly driven by external demand, while 
domestic demand was weak or even contracted. 
The recovery in Bulgaria was slow and mainly 
driven by external demand, while domestic 
demand was dampened by the continuing 
adjustment in the private sector. Romania 
was the only non-euro area EU country where 
the economy continued to contract slightly 
in 2010, owing mainly to the ongoing Þ scal adjustment. Overall, the pronounced shift in the drivers of economic growth compared with the year 
before the global recession reß ects the economic 
adjustment process that started during or, in 
some countries (e.g. the Baltic States), before 
the recession. PRICE DEVELOPMENTSAverage annual inß ation increased in 2010 
in most non-euro area EU Member States in 
spite of the continued weakness of domestic 
demand, still large spare capacity overall 
and the slack in the labour markets. The main inß ationary impulses came from rising 
food prices, but also from energy prices. 
In some countries, administered price and 
indirect tax changes added to inß ation. The 
increase in international commodity prices 
tended to have a greater impact on inß ation in 
the central and eastern European countries than 
in the other non-euro area EU countries owing 
to the greater weight of food and energy in their 
HICP baskets.The cross-country variation in annual HICP inß ation rates remained signi
Þ cant (see Table 8) 
in 2010. The highest average inß ation rates 
were recorded in Hungary (4.7%), where excise 
taxes were raised in January and previous VAT 
increases also had a base effect, and Romania 
(6.1%), which introduced a substantial VAT 
increase in July. Inß ation ranged between 
2.2% and 3.3% in most of the other countries. 
In the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Sweden, 
the average inß ation rate was positive but 
below 2%. Latvia was the only country with 
a negative average inß ation rate in 2010, at 
-1.2%. The intra-year developments suggest an 
increasing trend in inß ation in most countries. 
Inß ation in Latvia returned to positive territory 
in September 2010, which was entirely 
the result of rising food and energy prices.

2010food prices remained contained in all countries, and were even negative in some countries 
(e.g. Latvia and Lithuania), which would 
suggest that demand-pull inß ation pressures 
were subdued in 2010.FISCAL POLICIESApart from Estonia and Sweden, all non-euro 
area EU Member States are estimated to have 
posted general government deÞ cit ratios above 
the 3% of GDP reference value in 2010. The 
United Kingdom is estimated to have continued 
recording a very large deÞ cit, amounting to 
10.5% of GDP. DeÞ cit ratios declined in most 
non-euro area EU Member States in 2010 
compared with 2009, partly as a result of stronger 
than previously expected economic growth 
leading to higher tax receipts, while government 
debt-to-GDP ratios continued to increase. 
In the majority of countries budgetary outcomes 
for 2010 were in line with the targets contained in 
the updated convergence programmes submitted 
at the end of 2009. The degree to which budget 
balances improved in 2010 compared with a year earlier differed considerably across countries, 
depending on the extent of the improvement in 
the macroeconomic environment in conjunction 
with the country™s Þ scal response to the global 
Þ nancial and economic crisis. Whereas Bulgaria, 
the Czech Republic, the Baltic States and 
Romania all introduced expenditure cuts or 
restrained spending in 2010, in other countries 
the automatic stabilisers were generally allowed 
to operate. Moreover, in Denmark and Sweden 
discretionary Þ scal stimuli were adopted in 
response to the crisis. At the end of 2010 all non-euro area EU Member States other than Estonia and Sweden 
were subject to a Council decision on the 
existence of an excessive deÞ cit. Deadlines 
to correct the excessive deÞ cit situation are 
set at 2011 for Bulgaria and Hungary, at 2012 
for Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, 
at 2013 for the Czech Republic and Denmark 
and at (the Þ nancial year) 2014/15 for the 
United Kingdom.Table 9 Fiscal positions in the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area(as a percentage of GDP)Budget balanceGross debtEuropean Economic Forecast Œ autumn 2010Updated 2009-10 convergence programmesEuropean Economic Forecast Œ autumn 2010Updated 2009-10 convergence programmes200720082009

2010In 2010 government debt-to-GDP ratios are estimated to have increased in all non-euro area 
EU Member States apart from Sweden, though 
with the increase more moderate than in 2009 
in most countries. The rise in the debt-to-GDP 
ratio was strongest in the United Kingdom 
(9.6 percentage points), Latvia (9.0 percentage 
points) and Lithuania (7.9 percentage points), 
reß ecting mainly the large budget de
Þ cits in 
those countries. While the debt ratio remained 
above the 60% of GDP reference value in 
Hungary and rose further above this level in 
the United Kingdom, it remained below the 
reference value in the other non-euro area 
EU Member States. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
In 2010 the combined current and capital account 
balances of the non-euro area EU Member 
States (as a percentage of GDP) deteriorated 
in most countries (see Table 10). However, 
developments were very heterogeneous across 
countries. In Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, 
the current and capital account surpluses 
decreased, reß ecting the gradual recovery in 
these economies and strengthening domestic 
demand. The surplus also decreased in Sweden, as a result of the deterioration in the trade 
balance due to the strong recovery in domestic 
demand. In the Czech Republic the combined 
current and capital account balance moved 
from surplus to deÞ cit, owing to a rising income 
deÞ cit and a smaller trade surplus. The current 
and capital account deÞ cit widened in Poland, 
owing to strong domestic demand in 2010 and 
an increasing income deÞ cit, in Romania, mainly 
owing to declining remittances, and in the 
United Kingdom, as a result of a weaker trade 
balance. In a number of countries, however, 
the balance improved. In Bulgaria the current 
and capital account shifted from a deÞ cit to a 
surplus position on the back of strengthening 
exports and ongoing domestic adjustment. 
In Hungary, the surplus increased from 0.7% 
of GDP in 2009 to 3.0% in 2010, reß ecting the largely export-led recovery. Denmark 
recorded a rise in its surplus from 3.5% in 2009 
to 4.8% in 2010 on the back of stronger exports 
and still subdued domestic demand.On the Þ nancing side, foreign direct investment inß ows stabilised or increased in the course of 
2010 in almost all the non-euro area countries that joined the EU in 2004 or later. Denmark and Table 10 Balance of payments of the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area

2010Sweden continued to be net exporters of direct investment. Increases in the more stable 
components of the Þ nancing of the current 
account were, in the Czech Republic, Lithuania 
and Poland, accompanied by considerable 
increases in net portfolio investment. As regards 
other investment ß ows, many countries posted 
further net outß ows Œ mainly as a consequence 
of a stronger deleveraging process. In Latvia 
and Romania, private capital inß ows in 2010 
continued to be supplemented by Þ nancial support programmes provided by international 
organisations. EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTSExchange rate developments in the non-euro 

area EU Member States in 2010 were strongly 

inß uenced by the exchange rate regimes of the 
individual countries. The currencies of Denmark, 

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania participated in the 

exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II). They were 

subject to a standard ß uctuation band of ±15% 
around their central rates against the euro, except for 

the Danish krone, with a narrower band of ±2.25% 

(see Chart 41). ERM II participation was, in some 

cases, accompanied by unilateral commitments 

on the part of the countries concerned to 

maintain narrower ß uctuation bands or currency 
board regimes. These unilateral commitments 

place no additional obligations on the ECB. 

In particular, the Estonian kroon and the 

Lithuanian litas joined ERM II with their existing 

currency board arrangements in place, while 

the Latvian authorities decided to maintain the 

exchange rate of the lats at its central rate against 

the euro with a ß uctuation band of ±1%. 
The Estonian kroon and the Lithuanian litas 
stayed at their central rates during 2010. 
The Latvian lats remained broadly stable within 
the unilaterally set band of ±1% vis-à-vis 
the euro, ß uctuating close to the weak limit 
of the band. The lats did not come under 
signiÞ cant pressure in 2010, re
ß ecting the 
stabilisation of macroeconomic conditions 
and improved investor sentiment vis-à-vis the 
Latvian economy. The further compliance with 
the conditions of the international Þ nancial assistance programme led by the EU and 
the IMF also provided support and remains 
fundamental to the credibility of the exchange 
rate peg in the future. Turning to the currencies of the non-euro area EU Member States that did not participate 
in ERM II, two groups of exchange rate 
developments can be identiÞ ed. While the 
Czech koruna, the Polish zloty, the Swedish 
krona and the pound sterling continued to 
appreciate vis-à-vis the euro, the Hungarian 
forint and the Romanian leu were broadly stable 
(see Chart 42). The Czech koruna, the Polish 
zloty and the Swedish krona were supported by 
the growth performance of those economies. 
The pound sterling appreciated against the 
euro overall, but the exchange rate was 
highly volatile. With the exception of the Chart 41 Developments in ERM II EU

against the euro implies that the currency is on the weak (strong)

±2.25% applies. For all other currencies, the standard ß uctuation band of ±15% applies. However, as part of a unilateral 
commitment, the ß uctuation band for the Latvian lats is ±1%; for 
the Lithuanian litas a currency board arrangement is maintained; 
and for the Estonian kroon a currency board was in place until

2010Czech koruna and the Swedish krona, the appreciating currencies did not return to their 
pre-2008 levels vis-à-vis the euro.The brief episodes of volatility in the HUF/EUR exchange rate reß ected political 
tensions in Hungary, including the breakdown 
of talks between international organisations 
and the government, and downgrades by the 
major credit rating agencies. The Romanian 
leu remained broadly unchanged from 
January 2010, with short periods of heightened 
volatility due largely to political tensions and 
related risks regarding the implementation 
of Þ scal consolidation measures agreed with 
international organisations. The Bulgarian lev 
remained unchanged against the euro, reß ecting its euro-based currency board arrangement. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSFinancial market conditions generally improved 
in the non-euro area EU Member States in the 
course of 2010. Long-term interest rates, as measured by ten-year government bond yields, 
declined in most countries, and spreads vis-à-vis 
euro area government bonds narrowed on 
average. The decline in long-term yields was 
most pronounced in Latvia and Lithuania, owing 
to the improved macroeconomic performance 
and also because of their very high levels at the 
beginning of 2010. Turning to money markets, 
rates declined signiÞ cantly in most of the 
non-euro area EU Member States, partly owing 
to decreases in policy rates. A notable exception 
is Sweden, where policy rate hikes starting in the summer helped to push short-term market 
rates up by some 150 basis points. The turbulence experienced in some euro area sovereign debt markets had only a limited impact 
on credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the 
non-euro area EU Member States. Seen over the 
year as a whole, most countries registered only 
small changes in premia. There are, however, 
some notable exceptions. In the Baltic States, 
premia declined by around 145 basis points 
on average, reß ecting, among other factors, 
increased conÞ dence in austerity measures 
and the improved macroeconomic situation. 
Conversely, continued concern about the 
sustainability of Þ scal consolidation in Hungary 
caused Hungarian CDS spreads to widen by 
some 140 basis points over the course of the 
year. Stock markets in the non-euro area EU 
Member States on average outperformed euro 
area markets by a wide margin. This was most 
pronounced in the Baltic States, where stocks 
advanced by some 55% on average in 2010. In early 2011 equity markets continued to strengthen in most countries, while developments 
in long-term government bond yields were 
mixed. Hungarian CDS spreads fell by around 
75 basis points, supported by improved investor 
sentiment. MONETARY POLICYThe primary objective for monetary policy in 
all non-euro area EU Member States is price 
stability. Monetary policy strategies, however, Chart 42 Developments in non-ERM II

2010continued to differ considerably from country to country (see Table 11). In the Þ rst half of 2010 many non-euro area EU 
central banks, including eská národní banka, 
Danmarks Nationalbank, Latvijas Banka, the 
Magyar Nemzeti Bank and Banca Naional a României, decreased their key policy rates. 

Most of these rate reductions served the purpose 

of encouraging bank lending and supporting 

economic activity (in light of a signiÞ cantly 
negative output gap in a number of countries). In 

the second half of 2010 and in early 2011 the easing 

cycle came to a halt in most non-euro area EU 

countries. With the exception of Latvijas Banka, 
all non-euro area EU central banks that changed 

their key policy rates in this period, i.e. Danmarks 

Nationalbank, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank, 

Narodowy Bank Polski and Sveriges Riksbank, 

decided to increase them. Most rate increases 

were aimed at ensuring the fulÞ lment of the 
medium-term inß ation objectives of the respective 
central bank. The central banks of Hungary and 

Romania maintained the highest policy interest 

rates in 2010 (at 5.75% and 6.25% respectively 

at the end of the year), reß ecting higher in
ß ation 
rates and risk premia compared with other 

non-euro area EU Member States. In the case of 

Romania the high policy rate also reß ected the

CHAPTER 2CENTRAL BANKOPERATIONS 
AND ACTIVITIES 
92ECBAnnual Report
20101.1 OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 
AND STANDING FACILITIES 
The monetary policy instruments of the Eurosystem used in 2010 comprised open market 
operations, such as main reÞ nancing operations 
(MROs), longer-term reÞ nancing operations 
(LTROs) and Þ ne-tuning operations, standing 
facilities and minimum reserve requirements. 
The Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP) 
and the Securities Markets Programme (SMP)
were introduced as temporary, non-standard 
measures aimed at repairing malfunctioning 
segments in the euro Þ nancial markets. 
During 2010 the Governing Council did not 
change the key ECB interest rates (see Chart 43). 
The interest rate on the MROs, the interest rate 
on the marginal lending facility and the interest 
rate on the deposit facility remained unchanged 
at 1.00%, 1.75% and 0.25% respectively. 
The width of the corridor was thus kept at 
150 basis points. At the beginning of 2010 some of the 
non-standard monetary policy measures that had 
been introduced in response to the intensiÞ cation of the Þ nancial crisis in 2008 were gradually 
phased out. This involved discontinuing the 
six-month, the 12-month and the supplementary 
three-month LTROs and reintroducing variable 
rate tender procedures in the regular three-month 
LTROs, starting with the operation allotted on 
28 April 2010. Meanwhile, full allotment and 
Þ xed rate tender procedures continued to apply 
to the MROs and the special-term reÞ nancing operations (with a maturity of one maintenance 
period). Moreover, the foreign currency 
liquidity-providing operations (in Swiss francs 
and US dollars) conducted by the ECB were 
discontinued after 31 January 2010. On 10 May 2010 the Governing Council decided 
on several measures to address the severe tensions 
that had emerged over the preceding weeks 
in certain Þ nancial market segments. Besides 
the decision to again conduct all reÞ nancing operations as Þ xed rate tender procedures with 
full allotment, and to conduct a six-month 
LTRO with full allotment on 12 May 2010, 
the Governing Council announced the Securities 
Markets Programme as a new measure to 
address those tensions. In order to ensure that 
the monetary policy stance is not affected by 1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS, FOREIGN

2010the interventions under the SMP, the liquidity injected through the SMP is absorbed through 
the weekly collection of Þ xed-term deposits from 
the banking sector. Moreover, the temporary 
swap lines with the US Federal Reserve System, 
which were discontinued after 31 January 2010, 
were reactivated in May 2010, in coordination 
with other central banks, and the ECB resumed 
US dollar liquidity-providing operations.LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE BANKING SYSTEM 
When supplying liquidity through open market 
operations, the Eurosystem usually takes into 
account a daily assessment of the liquidity needs 
of the consolidated euro area banking system. 
These liquidity needs are determined by the 
sum of minimum reserve requirements, excess 
reserves and autonomous factors. Autonomous 
factors are those items on the Eurosystem™s 
balance sheet, such as banknotes in circulation 
and government deposits, which have an impact 
on credit institutions™ current account holdings 
but are not under the direct control of the 
Eurosystem™s liquidity management.However, with the exception of the regular LTRO allotted on 28 April 2010, all of the 
Eurosystem™s regular reÞ nancing operations 
in 2010 were conducted as Þ xed rate tender 
procedures with full allotment.1 As a consequence, the outstanding volume of 
reÞ nancing operations continued to be driven 
not by the supply considerations of the 
Eurosystem, but rather by the demand from 
counterparties, thereby reß ecting their 
underlying liquidity preferences. The level of 
current accounts above the minimum reserve 
requirement in 2010 stood on average at 
•1.26 billion, which was higher than the level of 
previous years (•1.03 billion in 2009 2 and •1.07 billion in 2008).During 2010 the euro area banking system continued to borrow an aggregate surplus 
of liquidity and to deposit it back with the 
Eurosystem, paying the Þ xed rate on the 
main reÞ nancing operations and receiving the 
rate on the deposit facility (which implied a 
spread of 75 basis points). The daily average net recourse to the deposit facility of the 
Eurosystem Œ which can be seen as one measure 
of the aggregate liquidity surplus Œ increased 
from almost •180 billion in January 2010 to 
nearly •300 billion in June 2010. Thereafter, 
it declined signiÞ cantly and steadily to just 
above •50 billion in December 2010.The implicit decline in the aggregate liquidity surplus during the second half of 2010 shows 
that the reduction in the total outstanding 
reÞ nancing brought about by the maturing 
of the one-year LTROs Œ the Þ rst on 1 July 
(•442.2 billion), the second on 30 September 
(•75.2 billion) and the third on 23 December 
(•96.9 billion) Œ was not compensated for 
by an equivalent increase in the outstanding 
volumes of the shorter-term reÞ nancing operations conducted with full allotment Þ xed rate tender procedures (see Chart 44). This can 
be interpreted as evidence that counterparties™ 
precautionary demand for liquidity from the 
Eurosystem eased throughout the year.In 2010 the average daily liquidity needs of the euro area banking system amounted to 
•557 billion, 3.5% lower than in 2009. The main 

reason for the decrease was the decline in 
autonomous factors, by 9%, to •346 billion 
on average. Minimum reserve requirements 
slightly decreased on average in 2010, to 
•212 billion, compared with •216 billion 
in 2009 (see Chart 44). MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEM 
Credit institutions in the euro area are required to 
hold minimum reserves on current accounts with 
the Eurosystem. As has been the case since 1999, 
the minimum reserve requirements were equal to 
2% of credit institutions™ reserve base in 2010 and 
amounted to •212 billion on average, 2% lower The LTRO allotted on 28 April 2010 was conducted with a 1 minimum bid rate of 1.00%. This was a technical and transitional measure to avoid allotment rates below the Þ xed rate in the MRO 
in the presence of ample liquidity. The indicative allotment 
amount for this operation was •15 billion; as only •4.845 billion 
was bid, the ECB allotted all bids in full. The weighted average 
rate of this LTRO was 1.15%.
Slightly revised Þ gure compared with the Annual Report 2009.
2 94ECBAnnual Report
2010than the 2009 average. Since for any maintenance period the Eurosystem remunerates reserve 
holdings at a rate which is the average of the 
marginal rates of the MROs over the maintenance 
period (if conducted as variable rate tender 
procedures) or at the Þ xed MRO rate (in the case of 
Þ xed rate tender procedures), the minimum reserve 
system does not impose a tax on the banking sector. 
At the same time, it fulÞ ls two important functions 
in the operational framework for monetary 
policy implementation. First, it contributes to 
the stability in short-term money market rates, 
because the reserve requirements have to be 
fulÞ lled only on average over the maintenance 
period, allowing credit institutions to smooth out 
temporary and unexpected liquidity inß ows and 
outß ows. Second, it enlarges the liquidity de
Þ cit of the banking system, i.e. banks™ overall need 
for reÞ nancing from the Eurosystem, thereby 
ensuring under normal market conditions a smooth 
and predictable demand for reÞ nancing from 
the Eurosystem, which facilitates the steering of 
short-term money market rates by the 
Eurosystem.OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 
The Eurosystem currently uses MROs, 
LTROs, special-term reÞ nancing operations and 
Þ ne-tuning operations to manage the 
liquidity situation in the money market. All 
liquidity-providing operations have to be fully 
collateralised. MROs are regular operations 
with a weekly frequency and normally 
have a maturity of one week. They are the 
main instrument for signalling the ECB™s 
monetary policy stance. Regular LTROs are 
monthly liquidity-providing operations with a 
three-month maturity. The gradual phasing-out 
of non-standard measures at the beginning of 
2010 led to the discontinuation of supplementary 
LTROs with three-month and six-month 
maturities. However, special-term reÞ nancing operations, introduced in September 2008, 
the maturity of which is synchronised with 
the respective maintenance period, were kept. 
The three liquidity-providing LTROs with a 
maturity of one year settled during 2009 matured 
on 1 July, 30 September and 23 December 2010. 
Four liquidity-providing Þ ne-tuning operations 
were conducted on 1 July, 30 September, 
11 November and 23 December to smooth 
the liquidity effect from the maturing of the 
six-month and one-year LTROs.In 2010 all 52 MROs were conducted as Þ xed 
rate tender procedures in which all bids were

2010satisÞ ed. The number of eligible counterparties 
increased to 2,267 in 2010, from 2,157 in 2009. 
On average, 115 counterparties participated in 

the MROs in 2010, compared with 401 in 2009. 

The average volume allotted in the MROs was 

•133.8 billion (see Chart 45), compared with 

•149.8 billion in 2009. The average allotment 

before the maturing of the Þ rst one-year LTRO 
(•88.4 billion) was about half the average 

volume allotted during the second half of 2010 

(•179.3 billion). In 2010 the lowest number of 

counterparties (65) to participate in an MRO 

was recorded in the operation that settled 

on 3 March, and the lowest MRO volume 

(•54 billion) was allotted in the operation that 

settled on 6 January.In the Þ rst half of the year, before the 
Þ rst one-year LTRO matured, the daily average outstanding volume of liquidity allotted 
in the LTROs, supplementary LTROs and 
special-term reÞ nancing operations was 
•671 billion. In the second half of the year the 
daily average fell to •431 billion before the 
maturing of the second one-year LTRO on 
30 September, and then decreased further to 
•333 billion during the last quarter of the year 
(see Chart 45).Participation in the special-term reÞ nancing operations (with a maturity equal to the length 
of the reserve maintenance period) increased 
signiÞ cantly in the course of the year, from 
•5.7 billion allotted in January to •68 billion 
allotted in December, with an eightfold increase 
in counterparties™ participation (from 7 to 56). 
Participation in the regular three-month LTROs 
was rather volatile throughout 2010, from a 
minimum of •2 billion allotted in March to a 
maximum of •149 billion allotted in December 
(an average of •45.1 billion). Finally, in the 
two six-month operations settled on 1 April 
and 13 May, counterparties participated for a 
total of •18 billion and •36 billion respectively 
(see Chart 45). The Eurosystem central banks continued their outright purchases of euro-denominated covered 
bonds as part of the Covered Bond Purchase 
Programme, which began on 6 July 2009. 
The targeted amount of the CBPP of •60 billion, 
purchased on the primary and secondary markets 
over the 12-month life of the programme, was 
reached on 30 June 2010. Together with the 
SMP, •134.8 billion was provided in 2010 
through outright purchases by the Eurosystem

Source: ECB.96ECBAnnual Report
2010The ECB may conduct liquidity-providing and liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations on 
an ad hoc basis to manage liquidity conditions 
in the market and to steer interest rates. 
The Governing Council™s decision to 
widen access to Þ ne-tuning operations as of 
6 October 2008 by granting eligibility to all 
counterparties that are eligible to participate in 
Eurosystem open market operations based on 
standard tender procedures, and that additionally 
fulÞ l certain selection criteria speci
Þ ed by the 
respective NCBs, remained in effect in 2010.In order to reabsorb the liquidity injected 
through the Securities Markets Programme, the 

ECB conducted liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning 
operations to collect one-week Þ xed-term 
deposits for a weekly amount corresponding 

to the settled size of the SMP itself. These 

Þ ne-tuning operations were carried out as variable 
rate tender procedures with a maximum bid rate 

of 1%. Moreover, the ECB conducted regular 

Þ ne-tuning operations to counter the liquidity 
imbalance on the last day of the maintenance 

periods. 12 liquidity-absorbing operations were 

conducted, with a one-day maturity, as variable 

rate tender procedures with a maximum bid rate 

equal to the Þ xed rate on the MROs. On average, 
•232 billion was absorbed via these operations, 

with 171 counterparties participating (see Chart 45).STANDING FACILITIESCounterparties may use the two standing 
facilities on their own initiative to obtain 
overnight liquidity against eligible collateral or 
to place overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. 
At the end of 2010, 2,395 counterparties had 
access to the marginal lending facility and 
2,789 counterparties had access to the deposit 
facility. The rates for these facilities provide a ceiling 
and a ß oor for the overnight rate and therefore 
perform an important function for monetary policy 
implementation. The corridor formed by the rates 
of the two standing facilities, with a width of 
150 basis points, was kept symmetric around the 
MRO rate, which was unchanged at 1.00%. This 
was done to ensure that the rate on the deposit facility remained above zero, thus maintaining an incentive for counterparties to trade in the unsecured overnight market.The use of the deposit facility was kept at high 
levels, in particular during the second quarter 
of 2010, when a new record of •384.3 billion 
was observed (on 11 June). The average daily 
use of the deposit facility was •145.9 billion 
(compared with •208.5 billion in the period 
from 9 October until 31 December 2008 and 
•109 billion in 2009). However, the use of 
the deposit facility declined signiÞ cantly and 
steadily throughout the second half of the year. 
In 2010 recourse to the deposit facility followed 
a broadly similar pattern during each reserve 
maintenance period: the deposit facility amounts 
were lower at the beginning of each period, but 
increased subsequently as more counterparties 
fulÞ lled their reserve requirements.
The average daily recourse to the marginal 

lending facility was •0.62 billion (compared 

with •1 billion in 2009). This further decline may 

conÞ rm a reduction in uncertainty about individual 
banks™ liquidity needs, an improvement in the 

functioning of the unsecured overnight interbank 

market and, this year in particular, the ampleness 

of allotments in the reÞ nancing operations. 
ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR MONETARY POLICY 

OPERATIONS 
As required by the Statute of the ESCB, and in 
line with central bank practice worldwide, all 
credit operations of the Eurosystem are based 
on adequate collateral. The concept of adequacy 
implies, Þ rst, that the Eurosystem is to a large 
extent protected from incurring losses in its 
credit operations and, second, that sufÞ cient collateral should be available to a wide set of 
counterparties, so that the Eurosystem can provide 
the amount of liquidity it deems necessary in its 
monetary policy operations and as intraday credit 
in payment system operations. To facilitate this, 
the Eurosystem accepts a broad range of assets as 
collateral in all its credit operations. This feature 
of the Eurosystem™s collateral framework, 
together with the fact that access to Eurosystem 
open market operations is granted to a large pool 97ECBAnnual Report
2010of counterparties, has been key in supporting the implementation of monetary policy in times of 
stress. The inbuilt ß exibility of its operational 
framework allowed the Eurosystem to provide 
the necessary liquidity to address the impaired 
functioning of the money market without 
encountering widespread collateral constraints 
during the Þ nancial crisis. The temporary 
measures to expand the list of eligible collateral 
which were introduced at the end of 2008 
remained in place until the end of 2010.In 2010 the average amount of eligible collateral 

increased by 7%, compared with 2009, to a total 

of •14 trillion (see Chart 46). General government 

debt, at •5.8 trillion, accounted for 41% of the total, 

while the remainder of marketable collateral was 

in the form of uncovered bank bonds (•2.7 trillion, 

or 19%), covered bank bonds (•1.5 trillion, or 

11%), corporate bonds (•1.5 trillion, or 11%), 

asset-backed securities (ABSs; •1.3 trillion, or 

9%), and other bonds (•0.6 trillion, or 4%), such 

as those issued by supranational organisations. 

The overall volume of marketable assets which 

had become eligible as a result of the temporary 

measures introduced in 2008 stood at •1.3 trillion 

at the end of 2010. The list of eligible collateral 

also includes non-marketable assets, mostly 

credit claims (also referred to as ﬁbank loansﬂ). 

In contrast to marketable assets, it is not possible 

to assess the eligibility of credit claims as long 

as they are not registered with the Eurosystem. 

Therefore, the volume of potentially eligible 

non-marketable assets cannot easily be measured. 

Taking into account this caveat, the amount of 

non-marketable assets deposited by counterparties 

as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations 

reached •0.4 trillion in 2010, representing 3% of 

total eligible collateral in the Eurosystem. The 

lower credit threshold temporarily introduced 

to expand the list of eligible collateral was also 

applied to non-marketable assets.The average value of marketable and non-marketable assets put forward by 
counterparties as collateral in Eurosystem credit 
operations slightly decreased, from •2,034 billion 
in 2009 to •2,010 billion in 2010. This decrease 
reß ected mainly the fact that counterparties had 
on average lower liquidity needs throughout 
2010. However, despite decreased liquidity 
needs, counterparties kept, on aggregate, 
similarly large additional amounts of collateral Chart 46 Eligible collateral by asset type(EUR billions; annual averages)2,0004,000

2010with the Eurosystem as they did in response to the Þ nancial market turbulence (see Chart 47). 
The share of deposited collateral not used to 
cover credit from monetary policy operations 
therefore increased to signiÞ cantly higher levels 
than in the years before. This suggests that a 
shortage of collateral has not been a systemic 
constraint on the Eurosystem™s counterparties at 
the aggregate level.As regards the composition of collateral put 

forward (see Chart 48), the average share of 

asset-backed securities slightly increased from 

23% in 2009 to 24% in 2010, thereby becoming 

the largest class of asset put forward as collateral 

with the Eurosystem, while the overall amount 

submitted remained stable. Uncovered bank 

bonds further decreased to 21% of the collateral 

put forward in 2010. Non-marketable assets 

gained further importance, with their share rising 

from 14% in 2009 to 18% in 2010. In addition, 

also owing to the sovereign debt crisis in some 

euro area countries, the average share of central 

government bonds further increased from 11% 
in 2009 to 13% in 2010. The asset classes which 

were temporarily eligible until the end of 2010 

accounted for around 1% of the total marketable 

collateral put forward at the end of 2010.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
The Eurosystem mitigates the risk of a 
counterparty default in a Eurosystem credit 
operation by requiring counterparties to submit 
adequate collateral. However, the Eurosystem is 
still exposed to a number of Þ nancial risks if a 
counterparty defaults, including credit, market 
and liquidity risk. In addition, the Eurosystem 
is exposed to currency risk in the context 
of liquidity-providing operations in foreign 
currencies against euro-denominated collateral, 
whenever these are conducted. In order to 
reduce all these risks to acceptable levels, the 
Eurosystem maintains high credit standards for 
assets accepted as collateral, valuates collateral 
on a daily basis and applies appropriate 
risk control measures. The establishment of 
the new Risk Management Committee has 
further contributed to the enhancement of the 
Eurosystem™s risk management framework 
(see also Sections 1.5 and 1.6 of Chapter 10).As a matter of prudence, the Eurosystem has established a buffer against potential shortfalls 
resulting from the eventual resolution of 
collateral received from defaulted counterparties. 
The level of the buffer is reviewed annually, 
pending the eventual disposal of the collateral 
and in line with the prospect of recovery. More 
generally, Þ nancial risks in credit operations are 
quantiÞ ed and regularly reported to the ECB™s 
decision-making bodies.In 2010 the ECB made a number of adjustments to its eligibility criteria and risk control 
framework. The Governing Council decided 
to keep the minimum credit threshold for 
marketable and non-marketable assets in the 
Eurosystem collateral framework at investment-
grade level (i.e. BBB-/Baa3) beyond the end 
of 2010, except in the case of asset-backed 
securities. As a consequence of this decision, the 
ECB announced on 8 April 2010 and published 
on 28 July 2010 a new schedule which duly Chart 48 Breakdown of assets (including credit

2010graduates haircuts according to differences in maturities, liquidity categories and the credit 
quality of the assets concerned, based on an 
updated assessment of the risk characteristics 
of eligible assets and the actual use of eligible 
assets by counterparties. Moreover, some 
changes were introduced in the deÞ nition of 
liquidity categories for marketable assets and 
the application of additional valuation mark-
downs for theoretically valued assets. The new 
schedule came into force on 1 January 2011. On 3 May 2010 the Governing Council decided to suspend, until further notice, the application 
of the minimum credit rating threshold in 
the collateral eligibility requirements for the 
purposes of the Eurosystem™s credit operations 
in the case of marketable debt instruments 
issued or guaranteed by the Greek government. 
This decision was, also from a risk management 
perspective, a result of the positive assessment 
of the Governing Council on the economic and 
Þ nancial adjustment programme negotiated with 
the European Commission, in liaison with the 
ECB, and the IMF and approved by the Greek 
government, along with the strong commitment 
of the Greek government to fully implement the 
programme.On 9 October 2010 the Governing Council decided on a number of further adjustments 
to the framework for the implementation of 
monetary policy in the euro area. These changes 
included clearer and more stringent provisions 
for the eligibility of ABSs, the introduction of 
additional exemptions from the prohibition of 
close links, the enhancement of the formulation 
regarding the suspension, limitation or exclusion 
of counterparties and assets on the grounds 
of prudence or a default, and clariÞ cations regarding the treatment of cases where the 
counterparty fails to sufÞ ciently collateralise a 
liquidity-providing operation.With a view to increasing transparency with regard to ABSs, thus making it possible to 
make more informed risk assessments for such 
assets and helping to restore conÞ dence in the 
securitisation markets, the Governing Council decided on 16 December 2010 to establish 
loan-by-loan information requirements for 
ABSs in the Eurosystem collateral framework. 
The Governing Council intends to introduce the 
loan-by-loan information requirements within 
approximately 18 months of the aforementioned 
date, Þ rst for retail mortgage-backed securities 
and thereafter gradually for other ABSs.When the necessary data-handling infrastructure 
to allow the processing, veriÞ cation and 
transmission of the data has been established by 
market participants, the provision of loan-by-loan 
information will become an eligibility requirement 
for the instruments concerned. The Eurosystem 
will continue to accept securities not meeting the 
new information criteria until the obligation to 
submit loan-level data comes into force.1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS AND 
OPERATIONS WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKSIn 2010 the Eurosystem did not undertake any 
interventions in the foreign exchange market. 
Furthermore, the ECB did not undertake 
any foreign exchange operations in the 
currencies that participate in the exchange rate 
mechanism II. The standing agreement between 
the ECB and the IMF to facilitate the initiation 
of special drawing right (SDR) transactions by 
the IMF on behalf of the ECB with other SDR 
holders was only activated on one occasion 
in 2010.The reciprocal currency arrangement (swap line) 
that the ECB established with the US Federal 
Reserve System in 2007 to counter strains in the 
European US dollar funding markets expired 
on 1 February 2010. In connection with the 
US dollar Term Auction Facility of the Federal 
Reserve System, and in close cooperation with 
other central banks, the Eurosystem provided the 
US dollar funding received via this swap line to 
its counterparties against collateral eligible for 
Eurosystem credit operations. In January 2010 
the Eurosystem conducted four operations as 
Þ xed rate tender procedures with full allotment 
and a seven-day maturity. The decision to let 100ECBAnnual Report
2010the liquidity swap line expire was taken against the background of improving conditions on 
Þ nancial markets in 2009. On 10 May, however, 
the temporary swap line was reactivated as part 
of a package to address the severe tensions in 
certain market segments that re-emerged in 
connection with the sovereign debt crisis in some 
euro area countries. In particular, the reactivation 
was designed to help alleviate pressures in US 
dollar funding markets and to prevent the spread 
of strains to other markets. These operations 
took the form of repurchase agreements and 
were carried out as Þ xed rate tender procedures 
with full allotment. Between May 2010 and 
25 February 2011 the Eurosystem conducted 
32 operations with a seven-day maturity, as well 
as one 14-day operation on 22 December and 
one 84-day operation on 18 May.The Eurosystem continued to provide Swiss franc liquidity to its counterparties via four 
swap operations with a seven-day maturity in 
January 2010. These operations were conducted 
in the form of EUR/CHF foreign exchange 
swaps at a Þ xed price and with a maximum 
allotment amount, determined by the ECB in 
coordination with the Swiss National Bank. On 
18 January 2010 the ECB announced that the 
Governing Council had decided, in agreement 
with the Swiss National Bank, to stop conducting 
one-week Swiss franc liquidity-providing swap 
operations after 31 January 2010, against the 
background of declining demand and improved 
conditions in funding markets. The ECB and the Bank of England announced on 17 December 2010, within the framework 
of central bank cooperation, a temporary 
liquidity swap facility, under which the Bank 
of England could provide, if necessary, up to 
GBP 10 billion to the ECB in exchange for 
euro. The agreement, which expires at the end 
of September 2011, allows pounds sterling to be 
made available to the Central Bank of Ireland 
as a precautionary measure, for the purpose of 
meeting any temporary liquidity needs of the 
banking system in that currency. This swap 
facility was not used in 2010. On 31 December 2010 a liquidity-providing 
repurchase transaction of •1.8 billion, with 
a maturity of three days, was settled. This 
transaction was conducted by the ECB in 
connection with liquidity arrangements in place 
with central banks outside the euro area.1.3 THE SECURITIES MARKETS PROGRAMME 
The Governing Council decided in May 2010 to 
establish the Securities Markets Programme. 
The objective of this temporary and ongoing 
programme is to address the malfunctioning of 
certain euro area debt securities market segments 
and to ensure an appropriate monetary policy 
transmission mechanism. In practice, the 
programme is implemented by Eurosystem 
portfolio managers carrying out purchases of 
certain euro area debt securities in market 
interventions. By 31 December 2010 the 
Eurosystem had purchased securities under the 
SMP with a total settlement amount of around 
•73.5 billion.3In order to reabsorb the liquidity injected 

through the Securities Markets Programme, the 

ECB conducted liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning 
operations to collect one-week Þ xed-term deposits 
for a weekly amount corresponding to the settled 

size of the SMP itself (see the ﬁOpen market 

operationsﬂ section earlier in this chapter).1.4 THE COVERED BOND PURCHASE PROGRAMME 
At the end of June the purchases carried out 
under another programme, the Covered Bond 
Purchase Programme, were completed. The 
Eurosystem purchased a nominal amount of 
•60 billion under the CBPP over the one-year 
period of its implementation, from 6 July 2009 
to 30 June 2010. The aim of this programme, More information on the SMP can be found in the ECB™s 3 press release of 10 May 2010, the ECB™s Decision of 14 May 2010 establishing a securities markets programme and the data 
published as part of the weekly Þ nancial statements of the 
Eurosystem.101ECBAnnual Report
2010which was one of the building blocks of the ECB™s enhanced credit support approach, was 
to contribute to the revival of the covered bond 
market. One of the main signs of the success of 
the CBPP is the noticeable reactivation of 
primary market activity for covered bonds. 
Between the announcement of the CBPP and its 
termination, 175 CBPP-eligible new covered 
bonds and 55 taps of existing CBPP-eligible 
covered bonds were issued for an overall amount 
of around •184 billion.4 Since March 2010 the securities held under the CBPP have been made 
available for lending on demand to eligible 
counterparties against eligible collateral. While 
this lending activity remained limited in terms 
of amounts, it is considered useful for proper 
market functioning that the securities held under 
the CBPP are in principle available for lending.1.5 INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
The ECB™s investment activities other than 
those related to the SMP and CBPP (see above) 
are organised in such a way as to ensure that no 
inside information about central bank policy 
actions may be used when making investment 
decisions. A set of rules and procedures 
(known as a ﬁChinese wallﬂ) ensures that 
inside information about monetary and foreign 
exchange policies of the ECB and of other 
central banks does not reach the staff members 
of the ECB™s Investment Division or the 
staff members of the NCBs who are involved 
in the ECB™s investment activities. Should 
inside information be passed on to these staff 
members, be it on purpose or not, the ECB™s 
investment activities may be suspended in full 
or in part, which means that the compositions of 
the ECB™s investment portfolios compared with 
their respective benchmarks are not allowed 
to change.FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio was 
originally set up through transfers of foreign 
reserve assets from the euro area NCBs. Over 
time, the composition of the portfolio reß ects changes in the market value of the invested assets, as well as foreign exchange and gold operations 
of the ECB. The main purpose of the ECB™s 
foreign reserves is to ensure that, whenever 
needed, the Eurosystem has a sufÞ cient amount 
of liquid resources for its foreign exchange 
policy operations involving non-EU currencies. 
The objectives for the management of the ECB™s 
foreign reserves are, in order of importance, 
liquidity, security and return.The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio consists of US dollars, Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. The 
US dollar and Japanese yen reserves are actively 
managed by the ECB and those euro area NCBs 
that wish to take part in this activity as agents 
for the ECB. Since January 2006 a ﬁcurrency 
specialisation modelﬂ has been in operation to 
increase the efÞ ciency of the ECB™s investment 
operations. Under this scheme, each NCB which 
wishes to be involved in ECB foreign reserve 
management, or group of NCBs acting jointly 
for this purpose, is as a rule allocated a share 
in the US dollar or the Japanese yen portfolio.5 Eesti Pank expressed an interest in being 
involved in ECB foreign reserve management 
activities and established a pool together with 
Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank for carrying 
out these activities together, whereby the two 
NCBs jointly manage a portion of the ECB™s 
Japanese yen portfolio on behalf of the ECB. The value of the ECB™s net foreign reserve assets 6 at current exchange rates and market prices increased from •51 billion at end-2009 to 
•60.6 billion at end-2010, of which •43.2 billion 

was in foreign currencies (i.e. the Japanese yen 
and the US dollar) and •17.4 billion was in More information on the CBPP can be found in: the monthly 4 CBPP reports published between August 2009 and June 2010; the box entitled ﬁCovered bond market developments and the 
covered bond purchase programmeﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, August 2010; and ﬁThe impact of the Eurosystem™s covered bond 
purchase programme on the primary and secondary marketsﬂ, 
Occasional Paper Series, No 122, ECB, January 2011.For more details, see the article entitled ﬁPortfolio management at 5 the ECBﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, April 2006.Net foreign reserve assets are calculated as ofÞ cial reserve assets 
6 excluding the net, marked-to-market value of foreign currency 
swaps, plus deposits in foreign currency with residents, minus 
future predetermined net drains on foreign currency holdings 
owing to repurchase and forward transactions. For detailed 
information on the data sources, see the ECB™s website.102ECBAnnual Report
2010gold and SDRs. Applying the exchange rates of end-2010, US dollar-denominated assets 
represented 76% of the foreign currency 
reserves, while those denominated in Japanese 
yen accounted for 24%. The 13% increase in the 
value of the foreign currency portfolio mainly 
reß ected the appreciation of the Japanese yen 
(by 22.6%) and the US dollar (by 7.8%) versus 
the euro over the year, as well as positive 
contributions from the capital gains and interest 
income generated by portfolio management 
activities. The value of the gold and SDR 
holdings increased by around 37%. This increase 
was mostly due to the appreciation of gold by 
around 38% in 2010, as measured in euro terms. 
During 2010 the ECB™s gold holdings did not 
change, but they increased at the start of 2011 
when Eesti Pank transferred some gold to the 
ECB as part of its transfer of foreign reserve 
assets to the ECB.In 2010 the list of eligible instruments in 
which the ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio 
can be invested was unchanged. In October an 
automatic securities lending programme for the 
ECB™s US dollar-denominated assets was started 
on the portion of the portfolio managed by the 
Deutsche Bundesbank on behalf of the ECB. OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of 
the invested counterpart of the ECB™s paid-up 
capital, as well as amounts held in its general 
reserve fund and its provision against foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks. 
The purpose of this portfolio is to provide the 
ECB with income to help to cover its operating 
expenses. The objective of its management 
is to maximise expected returns, subject to a 
no-loss constraint at a certain conÞ dence level. 
The portfolio is invested in euro-denominated 
Þ xed income assets. 
The value of the portfolio at current market 
prices grew from •11.8 billion at end-2009 to 
•13.3 billion at end-2010. The increase in market 
value was due to the increase in the ECB™s 
paid-up capital effective on 29 December 2010, 
as well as to investment returns.In 2010 the list of eligible instruments in which 
the ECB™s own funds portfolio can be invested 
was unchanged.To comply with the strict Chinese wall in place at the ECB, the implementation of the 
CBPP and the SMP led to a partial freeze in the 
investment activities related to the ECB™s own 
funds portfolio in 2010. RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESThe Þ nancial risks to which the ECB is 
exposed in its investment activities are closely 
monitored and measured in order to keep 
them within the levels speciÞ ed by the ECB™s 
decision-making bodies. For this purpose, a 
detailed limit structure is in place and limits are 
monitored daily. Regular reporting ensures that 
all stakeholders are adequately informed of the 
level of such risks. In 2010 the ECB continued to enhance the IT infrastructure supporting the risk management 
framework for its investment operations. This 
framework, which had been extended to cover 
the portfolio of covered bonds purchased by 
the ECB under the Covered Bond Purchase 
Programme, now also covers the Securities 
Markets Programme.One of the indicators used to monitor market risk is Value-at-Risk (VaR), which deÞ nes the 
loss for a portfolio of assets that will not be 
exceeded at the end of a speciÞ ed period of 
time with a given probability. The value of this 
indicator depends on a series of parameters used 
for the calculation, in particular the conÞ dence level, the length of the time horizon and the 
sample used to estimate asset price volatility. 
As an illustration, computing this indicator for the 
ECB™s investment portfolio, the CBPP portfolio 
and the SMP portfolio, on 31 December 2010, 
using as parameters a 95% conÞ dence level, a 
time horizon of one year, and a sample of one 
year for asset price volatility, would result 
in a VaR of •10.867 billion. Computing the 
same indicator with a Þ ve-year instead of a 
one-year sample would result in a VaR of 
•10.427 billion. The largest part of this market 103ECBAnnual Report
2010risk is due to currency and gold price risk. The low levels of interest rate risk in the ECB™s 
investment portfolios reß ect the fact that the 
modiÞ ed duration of these portfolios remained 
relatively low in 2010.The overall level of risks faced by the ECB has increased in view of the increased volatility in 
foreign exchange rates, interest rates and gold 
prices, as well as higher credit risk. This was one of the main reasons why the ECB decided 
to increase its subscribed capital by •5 billion 
with effect from 29 December 2010. As the 
maximum size of the ECB™s provision and 
reserves is equal to the level of its paid-up 
capital, this decision will allow the Governing 
Council to augment the provision by an amount 
equivalent to the capital increase, thus further 
strengthening the Þ nancial buffers of the ECB.
104ECBAnnual Report
20102 PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
The Eurosystem has the statutory task of promoting the smooth operation of payment 
systems. Payment systems and securities clearing 
and settlement systems are fundamental 
infrastructures that are necessary for the proper 
functioning of market economies. They are 
indispensable for the efÞ cient ß ow of payments 
for goods, services and Þ nancial assets, and 
their smooth functioning is crucial for the 
implementation of a central bank™s monetary 
policy and for maintaining the stability of 
and conÞ dence in the currency, the 
Þ nancial system and the economy in general. For the 
performance of this task, the Eurosystem applies 
three approaches: it takes on an operational role, 
conducts oversight activities and acts as a catalyst 
(for further details on the second and third of 
these, see Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 4).In terms of its operational role, the Eurosystem, according to the Statute of the ESCB, may 
provide facilities to ensure efÞ cient and sound 
clearing and payment systems. To this end, the 
Eurosystem operates the TARGET2 system 
and the correspondent central banking model 
(CCBM), is in the process of establishing 
TARGET2-Securities (T2S) and is developing 
a new Collateral Central Bank Management 
system (CCBM2).2.1 THE TARGET2 SYSTEM
The Eurosystem operates the TARGET2 
system for large-value and urgent payments in 
euro. TARGET2 plays an important role in the 
execution of the single monetary policy and the 
functioning of the euro money market. It offers 
a real-time settlement service in central bank 
money and broad market coverage. It processes 
large-value and urgent transactions without any 
upper or lower limit on the value of payments and 
has also attracted a variety of other payments. The system is based on a single technical infrastructure, the Single Shared Platform 
(SSP). Three Eurosystem central banks Œ the 
Banca d™Italia, the Banque de France and the Deutsche Bundesbank Œ jointly provide the SSP 
and operate it on behalf of the Eurosystem. By December 2010 TARGET2 had 928 direct participants. The overall number of banks 
(including branches and subsidiaries) that can 
be addressed worldwide through TARGET2 
remained stable at some 52,000. In addition, 
TARGET2 settled the cash positions of 
67 ancillary systems. TARGET2 OPERATIONS 
The TARGET2 system functioned smoothly 
in 2010 and settled a large number of euro 
payments. The system™s market share increased 
slightly, with 91% of the total value of payments 
in euro large-value payment systems being 
executed via TARGET2. In 2010 the system 
processed a total of 88,591,926 transactions, 
with a daily average of 343,380 transactions. 
Compared with the previous year, the overall 
volume of transactions was more or less 
the same, rising only marginally, by 0.1%. 
The total value of TARGET2 trafÞ c in 2010 
was •593,194 billion, with an average daily 
value of •2,299 billion. Compared with 2009, 
the overall value of the transactions processed 
by the system increased by 7.6%. Table 12 
provides an overview of payment trafÞ c in the 
TARGET2 system in 2010, comparing it with 
trafÞ c in the previous year.

days in 2010.105ECBAnnual Report
2010In 2010 the overall availability 7 of TARGET2 reached 99.68% and was affected only by incidents occurring in relation to national 
proprietary home accounting systems,8 while the SSP itself achieved 100% availability. 100% 
of the payments in the SSP were processed 
within Þ ve minutes. The system™s very positive 
performance, which has improved continuously 
since migration to TARGET2, met with the 
satisfaction of participants.COOPERATION WITH TARGET2 USERS 
The Eurosystem maintains close relations with 
TARGET2 users. Regular meetings were held 
between the NCBs and national TARGET2 user 
groups in 2010. In addition, joint meetings of the 
Eurosystem Working Group on TARGET2 and 
the TARGET Working Group of the European 
credit sector associations took place on a 
quarterly basis to discuss TARGET2 business 
issues at the pan-European level. Strategic 
issues were addressed in the Contact Group on 
Euro Payments Strategy, a forum composed 
of senior representatives from commercial and 
central banks.MANAGEMENT OF NEW SYSTEM RELEASESThe Eurosystem attaches the greatest importance 
to the development of TARGET2 in order 
to further increase the level of service offered 
and to meet the needs of its participants. 
In October 2010 the Eurosystem launched 
a user consultation on a possible strategy 
for improving TARGET2™s compliance with 
ISO 20022 standards.On 22 November 2010 the fourth release of the SSP was implemented.9 The main innovation of this release was the introduction 
of internet-based access to TARGET2. This 
consists of an alternative form of direct 
access to the main services of TARGET2, 
without, however, requiring connection to the 
SWIFT network. The Eurosystem developed 
internet-based access to meet the needs of small 
and medium-sized banks. In November 2010 the Eurosystem also Þ nalised the contents of the Þ fth release, which is due 
to be implemented on 21 November 2011.This release will include the provision of a 
network linking the participating central banks 
that will give them direct access to the main 
TARGET2 services in the event of a SWIFT 
outage, as well as various other enhancements 
requested by the user community.COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING IN TARGET2 
All euro area countries participate in TARGET2, 
as its use is mandatory for the settlement of all 
payment orders related to the Eurosystem™s 
monetary policy operations. In 2002 the 
Governing Council of the ECB conÞ rmed the right of non-euro area EU central banks to 
connect to the TARGET system on a voluntary 
basis in order to facilitate the settlement 
of euro-denominated transactions in these 
countries. From a legal and business point 
of view, each central bank is responsible 
for managing its system component and for 
maintaining relationships with its participants. 
In addition, some Þ nancial institutions located 
in other EEA countries participate in TARGET2 
via remote access.At the current juncture 23 central banks of the EU and their respective user communities are 
connected to TARGET2: the 17 euro 
area national central banks, the ECB and Þ ve national central banks from non-euro area 
countries.10 In February 2010    (Bulgarian National Bank) and its national user community connected to 
TARGET2. Recently, contacts have been 
established with Banca Naional a României, since it has expressed an interest in joining 
TARGET2. Romania™s connection to The level of availability is the extent to which participants were 7 able to use the TARGET2 system during their business hours without incident.
Proprietary home accounting systems, in which some payment 8 transactions can be settled until May 2012, are operated by some 
national central banks.
The system updates introduced in the fourth release were reß ected 9 in Guideline ECB/2010/12 of 15 September 2010 amending 
Guideline ECB/2007/2 on a Trans-European Automated Real- 
time Gross settlement Express Transfer system (TARGET2). 
The Guideline also takes into account the technical changes 
required following the entry into force of the Treaty.
Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.10 106ECBAnnual Report
2010TARGET2 is scheduled for July 2011, following completion of the necessary 
preparatory work. 2.2 TARGET2-SECURITIES 
T2S is the future Eurosystem service for 
securities settlement in central bank money 
in Europe. The project is currently in the 
development phase, and the settlement platform 
is due to go live in September 2014. 30 central 
securities depositories (CSDs) are presently 
involved in the project and it is expected 
that almost all traded securities in Europe 
will be settled in T2S, leading to signiÞ cant economies of scale and very low settlement 
costs. By removing the distinction between 
cross-border and domestic settlement, T2S will 
constitute a major breakthrough in the creation 
of an integrated capital market for Europe, 
providing a solid basis for increasing efÞ ciency and competition in the entire post-trading sector. 
Although T2S is a Eurosystem initiative, it will 
also settle securities transactions in currencies 
other than the euro if the relevant central bank, 
with the support of its market, gives its consent.Much progress was achieved on the technical side in 2010. The T2S user requirements were 
Þ nalised early on in the year, enabling four 
Eurosystem central banks Œ the Deutsche 
Bundesbank, the Banco de España, the Banque 
de France and the Banca d™Italia Œ to begin the 
IT software development work. T2S is now on 
course to launch user testing in January 2014 
and go live in September of the same year.SigniÞ cant headway was made in 2010 on the 
key policy aspects of the project, particularly issues such as how T2S will be governed, how 
much T2S will charge for the settlement of 
securities transactions, how T2S will be legally 
set up, and how participants will be able to 
connect to T2S. The governance of T2S is of central 
importance to all T2S stakeholders. The four 

main stakeholder groups are: i) the Eurosystem 
as system owner and operator, ii) non-euro area 

central banks which provide their currencies in 

T2S, iii) CSDs which outsource their securities 

accounts to T2S, and iv) market participants 

more widely (i.e. banks, custodians, central 

counterparties, etc.). In the proposed future 

governance set-up, each of the groups will have 

an appropriate degree of inß uence over T2S, 
while at the same time facilitating a timely 

decision-making process and ensuring safe and 

efÞ cient infrastructure. 
In November 2010 the Eurosystem came to 
a decision on the prices for the future T2S 
settlement services. After taking into account 
the development and future running costs, 
together with the expected settlement volumes 
on the platform, the Eurosystem set the price 
for the settlement of delivery-versus-payment 
(DvP) instructions at 15 cent, provided that the 
following conditions are fulÞ lled: i) currencies 
other than the euro add at least 20% to the 
euro settlement volume, ii) the securities 
settlement volume in the EU is no more than 
10% lower than the volumes projected by the 
T2S Programme OfÞ ce, which are based on 
information provided by market participants, 
and iii) the Eurosystem will not be charged VAT 
for T2S services. This price will be Þ xed for the 
period from September 2014, when T2S is due 
to go live, to December 2018. In order to provide 
assurance to market participants about T2S 
prices after 2018, the Governing Council has 
made a commitment not to increase T2S fees by 
more than 10% per year until September 2022. 
Pricing DvP settlement instructions at a low 
price of 15 cent each Œ a price which is identical 
for both national and cross-border settlement Œ 
means that even when including add-on charges 
from CSDs and from connectivity charges, 
the end-to-end price of settlement should 
be lower than the current price of national 
settlement anywhere in Europe. T2S will reduce 
the cost of settling cross-border transactions by 
around 90% on average. Combined with the 
positive effects on competition across the whole 
post-trading value chain, T2S will, therefore, 
deliver a major boost to cost-efÞ ciency in 
securities settlement throughout Europe.107ECBAnnual Report
2010In 2010 substantial progress was also made on the legal framework for T2S. On 21 April 2010 
the Governing Council of the ECB adopted 
the T2S Guideline.11 The T2S Guideline is the cornerstone of the legal framework for T2S 
and the basis for all other legal agreements to 
be concluded in the future. It is binding for all 
of the Eurosystem central banks, but does not 
bestow any obligations on third parties.The work carried out on governance and pricing was also a key ingredient in the legal 
work involved in negotiating the contractual 
arrangements for T2S: negotiations between 
the Eurosystem and those CSDs that intend 
to use T2S, as well as negotiations between 
the Eurosystem and those non-euro area 
central banks that are considering making their 
currencies available for settlement in T2S. 
Once the negotiations with the CSDs have 
been completed, the Governing Council of the 
ECB will endorse the Framework Agreement 
and then submit it to the CSDs for assessment 
and signature by autumn 2011. Negotiations 
on the Currency Participation Agreement with 
the non-euro area central banks progressed 
well during 2010 and it is anticipated that the 
Governing Council will submit the Agreement 
to non-euro area central banks in June 2011 for 
assessment and signature by autumn 2011.The Eurosystem has also been working on the framework for the selection of external network 
providers for T2S. These are the entities that 
will provide the infrastructure to enable CSDs, 
central banks and directly connected participants 
to send instructions to Œ and receive messages 
from Œ the T2S platform.Finally, the T2S Programme OfÞ ce, with the 
strong commitment and dedication of the T2S Advisory Group, was heavily involved in 
promoting the further harmonisation of 
securities settlement across Europe.12 Participation in the European Commission™s 
Clearing and Settlement Advisory Monitoring 
Expert Group II, as well its successor, the Expert 
Group on Market Infrastructures, ensures that 
harmonisation activities in T2S are in line with the overall public and private initiatives in the 
Þ eld.13 The T2S Advisory Group worked on the implementation of the corporate action standards 
on transaction management, the development of 
the ISO messages for T2S, and the improvement 
of cross-border shareholder transparency. 
Progress has also been made in terms of the 
harmonisation of the settlement Þ nality rules for 
CSDs participating in T2S. The T2S Advisory 
Group also launched work to identify and 
overcome any remaining obstacles to smooth 
cross-border settlement in T2S. The outcome of 
this work is essential to ensuring efÞ cient processing in T2S. Furthermore, at the end of 
2010 the T2S Advisory Group identiÞ ed key 
priorities for further harmonisation work in the 
coming years. 2.3 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR COLLATERAL 
A common set of eligible assets may be used 
to collateralise all types of Eurosystem credit 
operation, not only at the domestic level but 
also across national borders. The cross-border 
settlement of collateral in the euro area is 
conducted mainly via the CCBM and through 
eligible links between euro area securities 
settlement systems (SSSs). Whereas the Þ rst solution is provided by the Eurosystem, the 
latter is a market-led initiative. In December 2010 the amount of cross-border collateral (including both marketable and
non-marketable assets) held by the Eurosystem 
decreased to •762 billion, down from 
•866 billion in December 2009. Overall, at the 
end of 2010 cross-border collateral represented 
35.0% of the total collateral provided to the 
Eurosystem.Guideline ECB/2010/2 of 21 April 2010 on TARGET2-11 Securities.The T2S Advisory Group advises the decision-making bodies 12 of the ECB on both technical and policy issues concerning T2S. 
The T2S Advisory Group consists of approximately 90 senior 
representatives from national central banks, CSDs and market 
participants which have signalled their interest in joining T2S.
For further details, see Section 3 of Chapter 4 on Þ nancial 13 integration.108ECBAnnual Report
2010EUROSYSTEM COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT 
SERVICESThe CCBM remained the main channel 
for transferring cross-border collateral in 
Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit 
operations in 2010, accounting for 24.1% of 
the total collateral provided to the Eurosystem 
in that year. Assets held in custody through the 
CCBM decreased from •569 billion at the end 
of 2009 to •507 billion at the end of 2010. Commencing operations in 1999, the CCBM was set up as an interim arrangement based on the 
principle of minimum harmonisation. In order 
to introduce a more harmonised level of service, 
the Eurosystem decided in 2008 to launch 
CCBM2, which is based on a single platform. 
The development and operation of CCBM2 on 
behalf of the Eurosystem was assigned to the 
Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale 
de Belgique and De Nederlandsche Bank. CCBM2 will enhance harmonisation and increase the efÞ ciency of collateral 
mobilisation, as well as allowing Eurosystem 
counterparties, particularly banks operating in 
multiple countries, to optimise their collateral 
use and improve their liquidity management. 
Moreover, it will allow central banks to monitor 
the collateral used in credit operations more 
closely. The platform will be fully compatible 
with TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities. 
Following approval by the Governing Council, 
the major project milestones were announced 
in October 2010. These include testing at the 
central bank and market level in 2012 and going 
live in 2013. Migration to CCBM2 is scheduled 
to take place in two waves in the second and 
third quarters of 2013.ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES 

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSCross-border collateral can also be mobilised by 
using links between national SSSs. However, 
such links are only eligible for Eurosystem 
credit operations if they meet the Eurosystem™s 
user standards. Once the securities have been 
transferred to another SSS via eligible links, 
they can be used through local procedures in the same way as any domestic collateral. 
The amount of collateral mobilised through 
direct and relayed links decreased from 
•129 billion in December 2009 to •109 billion at 
the end of 2010. This accounted for 5.0% of the 
total collateral (both cross-border and domestic) 
held by the Eurosystem at the end of 2010, 
compared with 5.7% at the end of 2009. In 2010 no new eligible links were added to the 54 direct and 7 relayed links already 
available to counterparties. 109ECBAnnual Report
20103 BANKNOTES AND COINS 
3.1 THE CIRCULATION OF BANKNOTES AND 
COINS AND THE HANDLING OF CURRENCYDEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINSAt end-2010 there were 14.2 billion banknotes in 
circulation, with a total value of •839.7 billion. 

This compares with 13.6 billion banknotes, 

with a total value of •806.4 billion, 

at end-2009 (see Charts 49 and 50). In 2010 

the annual growth rate of euro banknotes in 

circulation, in terms of both value and volume, was 

in the region of 4%. The •50 and •100 banknotes 

showed the strongest growth, with annual 

growth rates of 6.7% and 5.4% respectively at 

end-December 2010, while the previously strong 

demand for •500 banknotes slackened markedly, 

with an annual growth rate of 2.1% being recorded 

by the end of the year. By the end of 2010 the •50 

banknote had the largest share in total circulation 

in volume terms (39.2%), while the •500 banknote 

had the largest share in terms of value (34.3%), 

closely followed by the •50 banknote (33.0%). 
Banknote demand from regions outside the euro 
area, which is strongly focused on high-value 
banknotes as a store of value, decreased slightly 
in 2010. Although it remained constant from 
mid-2009 to mid-2010, inß ows of euro cash 
exceeded outß ows in the second half of 2010. 
This could be a result of a reversal of the earlier 
hoarding of euro banknotes, which had been in 
demand as a safe haven following the Þ nancial turmoil in 2008. It is estimated that 20-25% of 
the euro banknotes in circulation in value terms 
are used outside the euro area, especially in 
neighbouring regions.In 2010 the total number of euro coins in circulation (i.e. net circulation excluding stocks 
held by the euro area NCBs) increased by 6.2% 
to stand at 92.9 billion, while their total value 
rose by 4.5% to stand at •22.3 billion. With 
a 61% share in the total volume of coins in 
circulation, the number of low-value coins Œ 
1, 2 and 5 cent coins Œ remained high. Chart 49 Number of euro banknotes

2010BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEMIn 2010 the euro area NCBs issued 33.6 billion 
banknotes, while 33.1 billion banknotes were 

returned to them. 34.2 billion banknotes were 

processed using fully automated banknote 

processing machines, which checked the 

banknotes for both authenticity and Þ tness for 
circulation. In that process, some 5.8 billion 

banknotes were identiÞ ed as being un
Þ t for 
circulation and destroyed. At 17.1%, the unÞ t rate 14 remained close to the rate recorded in 2009. 
The average return frequency 15 of banknotes in 
circulation decreased further, falling from 2.59 at 

end-2009 to 2.46 at end-2010, meaning that, on 

average, a banknote returned to a euro area NCB 

every Þ ve months. The high-value banknotes, 
which are frequently hoarded, showed low return 

frequencies (0.34 for •500 banknotes, 0.51 for 

•200 banknotes and 0.76 for •100 banknotes), 

while the return frequencies of the denominations 

which are typically used for transactions were 

higher (1.87 for •50 banknotes, 3.77 for 

•20 banknotes, 4.39 for •10 banknotes and 2.50 

for •5 banknotes).3.2 BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITING 
AND COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCECOUNTERFEIT EURO BANKNOTES 
In 2010 the National Analysis Centres 16 received some 752,000 counterfeit euro banknotes. 
When compared with the number of genuine 
euro banknotes in circulation, the proportion 
of counterfeits remains at a very low level. 
Long-term developments in the quantity of 
counterfeits removed from circulation are 
shown in Chart 52. Closer analysis shows 
that the upward trend in quantity which began 
to emerge in 2008 was reversed in 2010.

Chart 53. Although conÞ dence in the security of the 
euro is fully justiÞ ed by the ongoing 
anti-counterfeiting measures of European and international authorities, this should not give rise to complacency. The ECB continues to 
advise the public to remain alert to the possibility 
of fraud, to remember the ﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ test 
described on the ECB™s website,17 and never to rely on just one security feature. In addition, 
training is offered to professional cash handlers 
on a continuous basis, both in Europe and 
beyond, and information materials have been 
created and updated to support the Eurosystem™s 
Þ ght against counterfeiting. The ECB™s 
well-established cooperation with Europol and 

the European Commission also serves this goal.COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCE AT THE GLOBAL 

LEVELCooperation on counterfeit deterrence goes 
beyond the European level. The Eurosystem 
participates actively in the work of the 
Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group 
(CBCDG).18 The ECB hosts the International Counterfeit Deterrence Centre (ICDC), which 
acts as the technical centre for the CBCDG. 
The ICDC maintains a public website 19 which provides information and guidance concerning 
the reproduction of banknote images, as well as 
links to country-speciÞ c websites. 
3.3 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION AND ISSUANCE
PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTSFor 2010 the production of a total of 7.1 billion euro banknotes, with a value of •264.9 billion, 
was allocated to the euro area NCBs. 
The allocation of euro banknote production 
continued to be based on decentralised 
production with pooling, an arrangement 
initially established in 2002. Under this 
arrangement, each euro area NCB is responsible 
for the procurement of an allocated share of 
the total requirement for certain denominations 
(see Table 13).http://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/banknotes/security/html/index.17 en.htmlA group comprising 32 central banks and banknote printing 18 authorities that work together under the auspices of the G10.

2010ROADMAP FOR GREATER CONVERGENCE 
OF NCB CASH SERVICESOn the basis of a medium-term roadmap 
adopted by the Governing Council in 2007, the 
Eurosystem continued its work to achieve greater 
convergence as regards the cash services offered 
by euro area NCBs. In particular, the Eurosystem is in the process of 
Þ nalising an interface between euro area NCBs™ 
local IT applications for the electronic exchange of 

data with credit institutions. The data in question 

concern cash lodgements and withdrawals where 

cash services are offered free of charge by NCBs. 

The interface will allow credit institutions to 

use the IT application that they use with their 

domestic NCB for cash transactions with other 

euro area NCBs (for cash services provided free of 

charge by NCBs). Besides, since 1 January 2011 

orientation-independent banknote lodgements and 

withdrawals have been classiÞ ed as a common 
service provided free of charge by NCBs.RECIRCULATION OF BANKNOTES 
On 1 January 2011 Decision ECB/2010/14 on the 

authenticity and Þ tness checking and recirculation 
of euro banknotes became applicable and replaced 

the ﬁFramework for the detection of counterfeits 

and Þ tness sorting by credit institutions and 
other professional cash handlersﬂ (also known 

as the ﬁBanknote Recycling Frameworkﬂ or 

ﬁBRFﬂ). On 31 December 2010, at the end of 

the transitional period provided to the credit 
institutions and other professional cash handlers 

of some euro area countries allowing them to 

adapt their procedures and machines to the BRF, 

the requirements laid down in the BRF were fully 

applied in all euro area countries. Thus, all euro 

banknotes recirculated via ATMs or over the 

counter at branches of credit institutions will now 

have been checked for authenticity and Þ tness, 
which is an important guarantee for the public.Decision ECB/2010/14 lays down the procedures 
referred to in Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) 
No 1338/2001, as amended in 2008.20 Cash handlers are required to comply with these 
procedures, ensuring both ﬁthat euro banknotes 
they have received and which they intend to put 
back into circulation are checked for authenticity 

and that counterfeits are detectedﬂ. The Decision 
does not introduce major changes compared 
with the BRF, except that it applies to a larger 
number of addressees pursuant to Article 6(1) of 
Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001.THE EXTENDED CUSTODIAL INVENTORY 

PILOT PROGRAMME IN ASIAFollowing its withdrawal from the wholesale 
banknote business, the Extended Custodial 
Inventory (ECI) site of HSBC Bank USA in 
Hong Kong was closed down in October 2010.21 The remaining ECI sites, which are operated by 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (in Hong Kong) 
and Bank of Ireland First Currency Services in
a joint venture with United Overseas Bank 
(in Singapore), will continue their operations 
as part of the pilot programme until 
end-January 2012. THE SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTESThe Eurosystem continued work on a new 
series of euro banknotes in 2010, focusing on 
developing the origination materials (i.e. the 
master materials used for banknote production) 
and carrying out test prints to assess the ability Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2009 of 18 December 2008 20 amending Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.
An ECI is a cash depot maintained by a private bank holding 21 currency on a custodial basis.Table 13 Allocation of euro banknote

2010to produce the new banknotes in a large-scale production environment. The new series will 
retain the most important design elements from 
the Þ rst series of banknotes. The exact timing 
and sequence of issuance will be determined at 
a later stage. The Eurosystem will inform the 
public, cash handlers and manufacturers well in 
advance about the modalities of the introduction 
of the new banknotes. Euro area NCBs will 
redeem euro banknotes from the Þ rst series for 
an unlimited period of time. 114ECBAnnual Report
2010The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a wide range 
of statistics which support the monetary policy 
of the euro area and various tasks of the ESCB. 
These statistics are also used extensively by 
public authorities, Þ nancial market participants, 
the media and the general public. In 2010 regular 
euro area statistics continued to be provided in a 
smooth and timely manner,22 while signiÞ cant efforts were devoted to further improving the 
ESCB™s statistical framework in accordance 
with the annually reviewed ESCB work 
programme for European statistics. A particular 
challenge in this respect was the fact that 
growing data demands have placed considerable 
pressure on the resources available to compilers. 
One of the main work streams in 2010 concerned 
Þ nancial stability statistics. In this area, the 
ECB, with the support of NCBs, carried out the 
necessary preparations with a view to providing 
statistical support to the European Systemic 
Risk Board (ESRB) as of 1 January 2011 
(see Chapter 6) and contributed, under the 
auspices of the G20, to global initiatives 
addressing statistical gaps identiÞ ed following 
the Þ nancial and economic crisis. 
The implications of the Þ nancial and economic 
crisis as regards the production, use and 
publication of statistics were the central theme 
of both the Fifth ECB Conference on Statistics 
and the international seminar hosted by the ECB 
on World Statistics Day on 20 October 2010. 4.1 NEW AND ENHANCED EURO AREA STATISTICS
As a result of the statistical work conducted 
in 2010, further euro area statistics were made 
available, such as new statistics on MFI loans 
to non-Þ nancial corporations broken down 
by branch of activity on the basis of the NACE 
Rev. 2 classiÞ cation and new external debt 
statistics for the euro area broken down by 
sector and instrument. Data on the Short-Term 
European Paper (STEP) initiative (see also 
Section 3 of Chapter 4), a market initiative 
fostering Þ nancial integration in this market 
segment, were also developed further. STEP statistics, which have been published since 
September 2006, were complemented in 
September 2010 by the weekly publication 
of outstanding amounts for individual STEP 
programmes, including a breakdown by currency 
of issuance.In 2010 the implementation of enhanced euro area statistics under the amended ECB 
regulations on MFI balance sheet, MFI 
interest rate and loan securitisation statistics 
continued. Statistical reporting by Þ nancial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation 
transactions began in early 2010, and MFIs™ 
reporting of an extended statistical dataset for 
balance sheet and interest rate statistics began 
in mid-2010. These new data and related 
indicators will provide more detailed breakdowns 
(e.g. for collateralised loans and new loans to 
non-Þ nancial corporations) that will support 
the enhancement of monetary analysis. 
These statistics are due to be published for the 
Þ rst time in mid-2011 following an appropriate data quality review by the ESCB.4.2 OTHER STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENTS
In February and October 2010 the ECB 
published the results of the second and third 
waves of its biannual survey on euro area 
Þ rms™ access to 
Þ nance, which was conducted 
in cooperation with the European Commission. 
This survey provides predominantly qualitative 
evidence on the Þ nancing conditions faced by 
small and medium-sized Þ rms compared with 
large Þ rms, and the results are broken down, 
among other things, by Þ rm size, type of 
economic activity and Þ rm age, with a country 
breakdown provided for certain euro area 
countries. Further progress was made in 2010 with the implementation of the Eurosystem™s survey Statistics were released by means of 74 monthly, quarterly and 22 annual press releases, as well as being published in the Monthly Bulletin, the Statistics Pocket Book and the ECB™s Statistical 
Data Warehouse (see the statistics section of the ECB™s 
website).4 STATISTICS115ECBAnnual Report
2010on household Þ nance and consumption. 
This survey is currently being conducted by the NCBs of all euro area countries (in a few cases in 
collaboration with national statistical institutes). 
This survey aims to provide micro-level data on 
households™ (Þ nancial and real) assets and debts, 
together with complementary information on 
issues such as income, consumption, employment, 
pension entitlements, savings and inheritance. 
The public dissemination of aggregate indicators 
for the whole of the euro area and the provision 
of microdata to researchers is expected in the 
second half of 2012.Progress was also made towards establishing the collection and compilation of statistics on 
securities holdings on the basis of security-by-
security information. A pilot project to compile 
experimental statistics on the basis of currently 
available data is ongoing. Moreover, options 
for developing a harmonised, cost-efÞ cient steady-state solution are being investigated. 
These data will allow the production of more 
harmonised and higher-quality statistics and the 
analysis of the securities holdings of institutional 
sectors and sub-sectors at a granular level.In the Þ rst quarter of 2010 a quarterly list of 
Þ nancial vehicle corporations was published 
for the Þ rst time, complementing the daily list 
of EU MFIs and the quarterly list of investment funds, which the ESCB keeps up to date 
and intends to transform into a fully ß edged register of Þ nancial institutions. The lists of 
Þ nancial vehicle corporations and investment 
funds include a number of additional features 
compared with the list of MFIs, in particular 
security-by-security information (in the form 
of ISIN codes) on the securities issued by 
those institutions. This project is linked to the 
development by the European Commission of 
a statistical register of multinational Þ rms, the 
EuroGroups Register, in which steps are now 
being taken to remove legal obstacles to the 
mutual exchange of information for statistical 
purposes. The ECB continued its close cooperation with other international organisations for the development of international statistical 
standards. Together with Eurostat, the ECB 
focused mainly on the ongoing revision of the 
ESA 95, which needs to be aligned with the 
System of National Accounts 2008 and the 
sixth edition of the IMF™s Balance of Payments 
Manual. Together with the BIS and the IMF, 
the ECB also published the second part of a 
handbook on securities statistics, which covers 
holdings of debt securities. 4.3 STATISTICAL NEEDS RESULTING FROM 
THE FINANCIAL CRISISAs a result of the Þ nancial crisis, there has been 
an increase, at both European and global level, 
in user demand for statistics for the purposes 
of Þ nancial stability analysis. In addition to 
the work referred to in previous sections, 
a number of initiatives were conducted in 2010 
with the aim of enabling the ECB to ensure the 
performance of the secretariat function for the 
ESRB and thereby provide the ESRB with the 
necessary statistical and analytical support as 
soon as it was established (see Chapter 6).The ESCB also cooperates with supervisory authorities with the aim of bridging and 
reconciling statistical and supervisory 
requirements. As a result of cooperation with the 
Committee of European Banking Supervisors, a 
new classiÞ cation system was published in 2010. 
Over time, this will help to reduce the reporting 
burden on entities that are required to provide 
data to both the Eurosystem and supervisory 
authorities. In addition, the reporting frequency of 
the consolidated banking dataset, as published in 
the ECB™s report on EU banking sector stability, 
has been increased from annual to biannual for 
a core set of banking indicators. The timeliness 
and data content of the annual dataset have 
also been enhanced. Moreover, the ECB has, in 
close cooperation with the other members of the 
Eurosystem, developed statistics on insurance 
corporations and pension funds. These statistics 
are based on existing sources, mostly supervisory 
authorities Œ i.e. they do not require the collection 
of new data from reporting agents. For the 116ECBAnnual Report
2010further development of these statistics, and in the light of increasing user needs (for the purposes 
of both macroeconomic and Þ nancial stability 
analysis), the ECB cooperates closely with 
the European Insurance and Occupational 
Pensions Authority, the successor of the 
Committee of European Insurance and 
Occupational Pensions Supervisors, in order 
to ensure that future statistical reporting 
requirements are consistent with Solvency II 
and to minimise the reporting burden.In the context of worldwide international cooperation, the ECB participates in the 
statistical initiatives supported by the Þ nance ministers and central bank governors of the 
G20 with a view to identifying and addressing 
information gaps. As a member of the 
Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial 
Statistics, it worked together with the BIS, the 
European Commission (i.e. Eurostat), the IMF, 
the OECD, the United Nations and the World 
Bank to formulate an action plan submitted to 
the G20 summit held in June 2010. That action 
plan contains timetables for the implementation 
of a number of recommendations on how 
to address the measurement of risks in the 
Þ nancial sector, international 
Þ nancial linkages 
and the vulnerability of economies to shocks, as 
well as the communication of ofÞ cial statistics. 
The ECB is also helping to enhance the 
Principal Global Indicators website, which 
focuses on the G20 economies. 117ECBAnnual Report
20105 ECONOMIC RESEARCH 
Consistent with the approach adopted throughout the Eurosystem, the purpose of research activities 
at the ECB is to: i) provide research results 
relevant for the formulation of policy advice on 
monetary policy and other Eurosystem tasks, 
ii) maintain and use econometric models in order 
to construct economic forecasts and projections 
and compare the impact of alternative policy 
choices, and iii) communicate with the 
academic and research community, for example 
through the publication of research results 
in peer-reviewed scientiÞ c journals and 
by participating in and organising research 

conferences. In 2008 the ECB initiated a 

multi-year revision of its research agenda in order 

to absorb the lessons of the Þ nancial crisis and its 
aftermath. This later also included activities to 

support the work of the ESRB. In 2010 a great deal of effort was devoted to the analysis of Þ nancial issues, with a particular focus on constructing 
and deploying tools for the purposes of 
macro-prudential and systemic risk assessment. 5.1 RESEARCH PRIORITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Economic research at the ECB is performed in a 
decentralised manner: all business areas conduct 
research projects according to their needs and 
expertise. The Directorate General Research is 
charged with coordinating this research work, 
as well as producing high-quality research 
itself. The Director General Research chairs 
the Research Coordination Committee (RCC), 
which aligns research activities at the ECB with 
the requirements of the institution and the needs 
of its policy processes. The RCC establishes 
a set of priority areas each year and steers the 
focus of research activities towards these areas.The high-level research priorities established for 2010 were unchanged from 2009, 
namely: forecasting and model development; 
enhancing monetary analysis; understanding 
the transmission mechanism of monetary 
policy; Þ nancial stability and macro-prudential 
supervision and regulation; the efÞ ciency of the European Þ nancial system; payment 
and settlement issues; international linkages; and Þ scal issues. However, as regards the 
implementation of these priorities, the number of 
research activities on topics related to Þ nancial and macro-prudential issues was higher than 
in previous years. In particular, emphasis was 
placed on the development and deployment 
of tools to monitor and assist decision-making 
relating to Þ nancial issues. The number of 
research projects on enhancing monetary 
analysis also saw a substantial increase. Research on monetary analysis concentrated on the development and use of quantitative tools to 
assess monetary developments, with emphasis 
on providing high-quality analytical input for 
the preparation of policy decisions. In 2010 
one focus of this research priority was on 
the design of exit strategies for the current 
non-standard measures and analysis of the 
interaction between macroeconomic policies 
and Þ nancial stability. Two research forums 
tackled these issues.23 Work in this area resulted in the publication of a book entitled ﬁEnhancing 
monetary analysisﬂ, which was edited by 
Executive Board members Lucas Papademos 
and Jürgen Stark.24With regard to the monetary policy transmission 

mechanism, projects were initiated or continued 

on a variety of topics: asset price dynamics and 

risk premia; the role of the banking sector; the 

Þ nancial decisions of non-
Þ nancial Þ rms; and 
diversity, competitiveness and adjustment at the 

country level. Other projects continued from 

previous years included the Household Finance 

and Consumption Network,25 a Eurosystem 
network established in 2009 which collects and 

analyses micro-level information on a wide range 

of household decisions, and an ECB research 

forum on central bank communication policies. 
Research forums are formal internal channels for sharing 23 experiences and the results of ECB research projects on a speciÞ c topic.
http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/enhancingmonetary 
24 analysis2010en.pdf
Research networks coordinate the research activities of 25 Eurosystem/ESCB researchers and help to disseminate results. 
They may also involve external researchers.118ECBAnnual Report
2010The links between Þ nancial stability and 
monetary policy were also explored, with a focus on the development of Þ nancial stability 
indicators and analysis of the interaction between 
Þ nancial stability and overall macroeconomic 
performance. The development of Þ nancial stability indicators includes work on early 
warning models, stress-testing tools and models 
of contagion and systemic risk. New areas of 
research are being explored in order to enhance 
existing models capturing the interaction 
between Þ nancial stability and macroeconomic 
performance. Many projects in this area 
fall under the umbrella of the new ESCB 
Macro-prudential Research Network, which 
was established in March 2010 (see Box 10 in 
Chapter 6). Research on the efÞ ciency of the 
Þ nancial system focused on understanding the money market and improving the design of operational 
frameworks, including analysis of exit strategies 
and money market spreads. The ECB continued research work on the Single 
Euro Payments Area and TARGET2 under the 

umbrella of the Payment Economics Network.26 A conference on these topics was organised in 2010. 
As regards the research priority relating to international issues, the main areas of 
interest were globalisation, Þ nancial and trade 
linkages, and the international role of the euro. 
Globalisation and Þ nancial and trade linkages 
were the focus of two ECB research forums. 
The discussion on trade linkages informs the 
work carried out on tools to model trade ß ows in the Eurosystem/ECB projections. On the Þ scal front, further work was undertaken 
on the development of tools for the monitoring and analysis of public Þ nances and their 
efÞ ciency and sustainability. A new research 
topic in 2010 was the interaction between Þ scal and monetary policy, particularly during the 
implementation of exit strategies. 5.2 DISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH: 
PUBLICATIONS AND CONFERENCESAs in previous years, ECB staff research was 
published in the ECB™s Working Paper Series 
and Occasional Paper Series. 138 Working
Papers and 14 Occasional Papers were 
published in 2010. A total of 104 Working 
Papers were written or co-written by ECB 
staff, a large number together with Eurosystem 
economists, with the remainder being written 
by external visitors attending conferences and 
workshops, participating in research networks 
or spending a prolonged period at the ECB 
for the completion of a research project.27 As is now the well-established norm, most of the 
papers are eventually expected to be published 
in leading peer-reviewed academic journals. 
In 2010 ECB staff published more than 
113 articles in academic journals. Furthermore, 
in 2010 the ECB continued, together with a 
large number of other central banks, to provide 
editorial support for the International Journal of 
Central Banking. Another regular ECB publication is the Research Bulletin, which is used to disseminate research 
work of general interest to a wide audience. 
Issues were published in March, June and 
November 2010. Topics tackled included: the 
reporting of results from the Wage Dynamics 
Network; the analysis of Þ scal stimulus; 
Þ nancial-related issues and their impact on 
policy (e.g. analysis of risk as priced in markets, 
bank lending standards and money markets 
during the crisis); the incorporation of Þ nancial frictions in DSGE models; and the combination 
of forecasts.28 Further information on this network can be found at 26 http://www.paymenteconomics.orgExternal researchers visit the ECB on an ad hoc basis or in the 27 context of formal programmes such as the Lamfalussy Research 
Fellowship.
The full set of topics can be found at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/28 pub/scientiÞ c/resbull/html/index.en.html119ECBAnnual Report
2010The ECB organised or co-organised  
15 conferences and workshops on research 
topics in 2010. Co-organised conferences 
involved the Centre for Economic Policy 
Research, the BIS and other central banks, 
both within and outside the Eurosystem. 
Furthermore, a large number of workshops and 
seminars were organised to disseminate research 
within the ECB. As in previous years, most of 
the conferences and workshops were related to 
speciÞ c research priorities. The programmes for 
these events and the papers presented are 
available on the ECB™s website.29Another long-standing mechanism for the 
dissemination of research is the organisation of 
seminar series, of which two are of particular 
relevance: the Joint Lunchtime Seminars, 
co-organised with the Deutsche Bundesbank and 
the Center for Financial Studies, and the Invited 
Speaker Seminars. These two series comprise 
weekly seminars, at which external researchers 
are invited to present their recent work at the 
ECB. The ECB also organises research seminars 
outside the scope of these two series on a more 
ad hoc basis.http://www.ecb.europa.eu/events/conferences29 120ECBAnnual Report
20106 OTHER TASKS AND ACTIVITIES
6.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITION 
OF MONETARY FINANCING 
AND PRIVILEGED ACCESSPursuant to Article 271(d) of the Treaty, 

the ECB is entrusted with the task of 

monitoring the compliance of the 27 EU NCBs 

and the ECB with the prohibitions implied by 

Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty and Council 

Regulations (EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. 

Article 123 prohibits the ECB and the NCBs 

from providing overdraft facilities or any 

other type of credit facility to governments 

and EU institutions or bodies, as well as from 

purchasing debt instruments directly from 

them. Article 124 prohibits any measure, 

not based on prudential considerations, which 

establishes privileged access by governments 

and EU institutions or bodies to Þ nancial 
institutions. In parallel with the Governing 

Council, the European Commission monitors 

Member States™ compliance with the above 

provisions. 
The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ secondary market purchases of debt instruments 
issued by the domestic public sector, the 
public sector of other Member States and EU 
institutions and bodies. According to the recitals 
of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the 
acquisition of public sector debt instruments 
in the secondary market must not be used to 
circumvent the objective of Article 123 of the 
Treaty. Such purchases should not become 
a form of indirect monetary Þ nancing of the 
public sector.The monitoring exercise conducted for 2010 
indicates that the following cases could be 

seen as non-compliant with the provisions of 

Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty and the 

related Council Regulations. 
First, at the Banco de Portugal, there was 
a placement of a seven-day deposit of 

USD 12.5 million with a Portuguese public 

sector bank on 13 May 2010. This was due 

to an operational mistake. Second, advance 

payments were made by De Nederlandsche 
Bank in the context of the operation of the 

Dutch deposit insurance scheme. Legislation 

to make the Dutch deposit insurance scheme 

compliant with the monetary financing 

prohibition is necessary. Third, at the Central 

Bank of Cyprus, remuneration of the current 

account balance of the deposit guarantee 

scheme took place above comparable market 

rates, which is not in line with the objectives 

of the monetary financing prohibition. In this 

respect, the Central Bank of Cyprus reported 

that it had taken a decision to remunerate this 

account at market rates by the beginning of 

2012. Fourth, the scheme for the remuneration 

of government deposits at the Banca d™Italia 

led to remuneration above comparable market 

rates. In this respect, the Banca d™Italia 

reported that the remuneration scheme is 

currently being revised. The revision should 

be finalised as soon as possible, in order to 

be in line with the objectives of the monetary 

financing prohibition.In more general terms, it is worth recalling 
that the prohibitions implied by Articles 123 

and 124 of the Treaty need to be strictly 

respected, even in case of a financial crisis.6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONS
Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty require 
that the ECB be consulted on any proposed EU 
or draft national legislation falling within its 
Þ elds of competence.
30 All ECB opinions are published on the ECB™s website. ECB opinions 
on proposed EU legislation are also published 
in the OfÞ cial Journal of the European Union.
In 2010 the ECB adopted 95 opinions on 
proposed EU or draft national legislation 
falling within the ECB™s Þ elds of competence: 
ten opinions were issued on proposed EU 
legislation and 85 were issued on draft national 
legislation. This compares with 100 opinions in The United Kingdom is exempt from the consultation obligation, 30 pursuant to the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is 
annexed to the Treaty, OJ C 83, 30.3.2010, p. 284.121ECBAnnual Report
20102009. A list of the opinions adopted in 2010 and early 2011 is annexed to this Annual Report. The ECB opinions issued at the request of the Council, the European Parliament and the 
European Commission concerned, inter alia, 
the ongoing reform of economic governance 
and Þ nancial regulation, as well as legislation 
on the introduction of the euro in Estonia and 
the conversion rate between the euro and the 
Estonian kroon 31 (see Chapter 3).The ECB  welcomed the European Commission™s proposal to enhance the 
quality of statistical reporting in the context 
of the excessive deÞ cit procedure, which 
is part of the Stability and Growth Pact, 
as part of the continuing reform of economic 
governance in the EU.32 In another opinion,33 the ECB welcomed a comprehensive package of 
legislative proposals to strengthen the framework 

for economic and budgetary surveillance in the 

EU. These proposals included the introduction 
of a framework for macroeconomic surveillance, 
which the ECB particularly welcomed, as it 
closes an important lacuna in the EU™s economic 

governance. At the same time, the ECB called 
on the EU legislator and the Member States 
to take advantage of the ongoing legislative 
process to strengthen economic governance 
to the maximum extent allowed under the Treaties. The ECB noted that the proposals 
made should provide for greater automaticity 
and suggested in particular that the Council, 
or at least the Eurogroup, should, by means of a 
declaration, commit itself, as a rule, to following 
Commission proposals and recommendations 
to continue procedures against non-compliant 
Member States. The ECB also provided drafting 
suggestions in respect of all proposals.As regards the reform of supervision in the EU, the ECB supported the objective of the proposed 
ﬁomnibus directiveﬂ amending 11 Þ nancial sector directives to ensure the proper functioning 
of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) 
and the European Systemic Risk Board.34 The ECB™s drafting proposals focused on 
matters of relevance to the ECB/ESCB and the ESRB, such as the removal of legal 
obstacles to information sharing between the 
ECB/ESCB, the ESRB, the three ESAs and the 
national supervisory authorities. The ECB also 
commented on the necessary amendments to 
the rules on the supplementary supervision of 
Þ nancial entities in a 
Þ nancial conglomerate 
in order to close certain supervisory gaps, for 
example the inclusion of asset management 
companies as part of Þ nancial conglomerates 
within the scope of the supervision.35In the context of the post-crisis regulatory reform 
of the Þ nancial services market, the ECB issued 
opinions on several proposals, including the 
revision of regulatory capital requirements and 
the regulation of credit rating agencies.36 The ECB supported efforts to create a robust 
regulatory framework in order to prevent future 
Þ nancial crises, while calling for the preservation 
of a level playing Þ eld and for global regulatory 
convergence where feasible. The ECB stressed 
the need to maintain sound risk assessment 
practices for assets covered by the Eurosystem 
collateral framework, including the possibility 
for central banks to access loan-level information 
on structured Þ nance instruments. On the 
proposed regulation on over-the-counter (OTC) 
derivatives, central counterparties (CCPs) and 
trade repositories, the ECB welcomed this step 
towards implementing the G20 agreement of 
September 2009 that standardised OTC 
derivative contracts should be traded on 
exchanges or electronic trading platforms where 
appropriate and cleared through CCPs by the end 
of 2012.37 Nevertheless, the ECB also expressed a number of concerns, particularly about the lack 
of consideration given to the ECB™s and NCBs™ 
oversight powers and regarding the provisions 
on access to central bank facilities.The ECB also responded to a signiÞ cant number 
of consultations by national authorities, some of CON/2010/52.31 CON/2010/28.32 CON/2011/13. See also Chapter 5 of this Annual Report.33 CON/2010/23.34 CON/2011/6.35 CON/2010/65 and CON/2010/82. 36 CON/2011/1.37 122ECBAnnual Report
2010which concerned developments in supervisory structures in Ireland, Greece, France and 
Austria.38 The ECB noted the merger of the supervisory authorities in France and welcomed 
the new Prudential Control Authority, which 
is to be headed by the Governor of the Banque 
de France.39 The proposed framework is likely to enhance the Banque de France™s ability 
to contribute to analytical support for the 
ESRB. The ECB also welcomed the proposed 
restructuring of the Central Bank and Financial 
Services Authority of Ireland 40 so as to make the central bank fully responsible for the supervision 
of credit and Þ nancial institutions. The ECB 
made detailed observations on central bank 
independence and the prohibition of monetary 
Þ nancing. The ECB was also consulted on a number of 
measures relating to Þ nancial market stability, 
some in connection with the Þ nancial crisis.
41 In particular, the ECB issued an opinion 42 on the Greek draft law establishing the Financial 
Stability Fund in order to maintain the stability 
of the Greek banking system by means of 
the recapitalisation of credit institutions. 
The ECB welcomed the close links between the 
Fund and the banking supervisory framework. 
Taking into account the Bank of Greece™s 
existing supervisory powers, the law should 
ensure that capital adequacy requirements are 
properly maintained. The ECB also welcomed 
the initiating role of the Bank of Greece™s 
Governor in the appointment of the Fund™s 
board members. Commenting on draft German legislation on compensation systems in credit and Þ nancial institutions and insurance companies,43 the ECB emphasised the general importance 
of aligning the relevant requirements with 
international standards and EU legislation to 
avoid regulatory arbitrage and contribute to 
limiting excessive risk-taking. Other opinions 
on procedures for Þ nancially distressed credit 
institutions highlighted the importance of an 
efÞ cient resolution regime for safeguarding the 
stability of the Þ nancial system.
44 In its opinions on a new winding-up regime for failing credit institutions in Denmark 45 and the restructuring of banks in Germany,46 the ECB welcomed the further disengagement of the state in favour of 
resolution regimes primarily based on Þ nancing by the credit institution sector. Where a crisis 
situation requires the supplementary use of 
public funds, the banking sector should be 
called upon to reimburse the state. This should 
promote additional market discipline and 
address the risk of moral hazard. In its opinion 
on draft amendments to state support measures 
in Poland,47 the ECB expressed concern that these measures would effectively be converted 
into open-ended measures, contrary to the 
requirement that national support measures 
be temporary in nature. Avoiding the renewal 
of a temporary regime would deprive the 
prolongation of such a regime of the necessary 
review with regard to monetary policy and 
Þ nancial stability aspects.
In the area of statistics, the ECB was consulted 
on the establishment of the Hellenic Statistical 
System and an independent statistical authority 
in Greece.48 The ECB emphasised that the credibility of budgetary surveillance in the EU Œ 
and ultimately the credibility and the sound 
functioning of Monetary Union Œ depends on 
the reliable and timely compilation of statistics 
relating to the excessive deÞ cit procedure, which 
should be independent of political cycles. CON/2010/30, CON/2010/48, CON/2010/33, CON/2010/4 and 38 CON/2010/57. CON/2010/4.39 CON/2010/30 and CON/2010/48.40 CON/2010/3, CON/2010/7, CON/2010/10, CON/2010/11, 41 CON/2010/12, CON/2010/21, CON/2010/26, CON/2010/29,

2010In its opinion on a new legal framework for the production of national statistics in Estonia,49 the ECB stressed the importance of securing 
the independence of the Estonian National 
Statistical Institute, as this would be of particular 
signiÞ cance for the smooth functioning of the 
EMU framework following the adoption of the 
euro.50 The ECB adopted several opinions concerning 
the NCBs, including amendments to the statutes 
of the Bulgarian, Danish, Estonian, Irish, French, 
Lithuanian, Hungarian and Polish NCBs.51 The ECB noted that the uncertainty regarding 
the legal status of Lietuvos bankas™ real property 
undermines the NCB™s institutional and 
Þ nancial independence.
52 The ECB welcomed the increase in the Banque de France™s capital 
and statutory reserve.53 A number of opinions concerned the remuneration of NCB staff in 
the context of legislation aimed at restoring 
budgetary balance.54 The ECB welcomed the efforts to achieve Þ scal consolidation and 
stressed that, to protect an NCB™s autonomy in 
staff matters, the draft legislative provisions on 
the remuneration of NCB staff must be decided 
in close and effective cooperation with the NCB, 
taking due account of the NCB™s views to ensure 
its ongoing ability to independently perform the 
tasks conferred on it by the Treaty, the Statute of 
the ESCB and national legislation. In its opinion 
concerning the Portuguese austerity measures,55 the ECB elaborated on the necessity of effective 
cooperation and stressed that the absence of 
such effective cooperation would constitute a 
serious infringement of the principle of central 
bank independence. With regard to Hungary, 
the ECB voiced concerns regarding the frequent 
changes to the Law on the Magyar Nemzeti 
Bank, stating that a consideration in the context 
of central bank independence is a stable legal 
framework for the central bank, and cautioned 
against measures seeking to inß uence the 
Governor and the other members of the Magyar 
Nemzeti Bank™s decision-making bodies in 
contradiction of central bank independence 
under Article 130 of the Treaty.56 The ECB also noted that salary cuts for NCB staff must 
comply with the prohibition of monetary Þ nancing under Article 123 of the Treaty.
57 Since 2008 information regarding clear and 
important cases 58 of non-compliance with the obligation to consult the ECB on draft national 
and EU legislation has also been included in the 
Annual Report. In 2010 the ECB recorded two such cases of non-consultation on proposed EU legislation, 
including one case in which the ECB issued an 
opinion on its own initiative. The Þ rst case of 
non-consultation concerned a proposed 
Commission regulation implementing Regulation 
(EC) No 177/2008 on a common framework for 
business registers for statistical purposes in the 
context of the exchange of conÞ dential data 
between Eurostat and central banks. 59 The ECB considers that the Regulation is relevant to the 
ECB™s cooperation with EU institutions, bodies, 
ofÞ ces and agencies for the collection of statistics 
necessary to undertake the ESCB™s tasks under 
Article 5 of the Statute of the ESCB and that it 
should therefore have been consulted at an 
appropriate stage in the legislative process. The second case of non-consultation concerned a proposal for a directive amending Directives 
2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC as regards capital 
requirements for the trading book and for CON/2010/2.49 The ECB was also consulted on several draft legislative measures 50 in connection with the preparations for the introduction of the euro in Estonia. For details, see Section 2 of Chapter 3.

CON/2010/80.55 CON/2010/91.56 CON/2010/51, CON/2010/69 and CON/2010/80. 57 The ECB understands ﬁclearﬂ to mean cases in which there 
58 is no legal doubt that the ECB should have been consulted, 

and ﬁimportantﬂ to mean cases: i) in which, if consultation 

had taken place, the ECB would have made signiÞ cant critical 
comments on the substance of the legislative proposal; or 

ii) which are of general signiÞ cance to the ESCB.
Commission Regulation (EU) No 1097/2010 of 26 November

Parliament and of the Council establishing a common framework 

for business registers for statistical purposes, as regards the

and central banks, OJ L 312, 27.11.2010, p. 1.124ECBAnnual Report
2010re-securitisations, and the supervisory review of remuneration policies.60 The ECB had been consulted on an earlier draft and issued an 
opinion 61 on 12 November 2009. On 7 July 2010 
the European Parliament adopted the directive, 
which contained a number of amendments, and 
the directive was then subject to the Council™s 
formal adoption.62 In view of the obligation to reconsult the ECB on important amendments to 
proposed legislative acts falling within its Þ elds of competence, the ECB issued an opinion on 
the amended proposal on its own initiative on 
6 August 2010.63 In 2010 the ECB recorded ten cases of non-
consultation on draft national legislation 
and issued one opinion on its own initiative. 
The following Þ ve cases were considered clear 
and important. The Bulgarian authorities failed to consult the ECB on a law related to the composition 
and functions of the Financial Supervision 
Commission and, in particular, the parameters 
of the Financial Stability Advisory Council, 
a matter of general signiÞ cance to the ESCB.
The ECB was not consulted on a Portuguese law 
assigning certain new tasks to the central bank. 
The law is of general signiÞ cance to the ESCB, 
as it relates to the Þ nancial independence of the 
NCB, and the ECB would have made signiÞ cant critical comments.With regard to Þ nancial crisis-related measures, 
the ECB was not consulted in three cases. 
The Greek authorities failed to consult the ECB on 

two occasions: Þ rst, a draft law on the reform of the 
public sector recruitment system, which affected 

the Bank of Greece™s exclusive competence to 

recruit a speciÞ c category of staff; and second, 
a draft law providing, inter alia, for restrictions 

in the recruitment of staff by public sector 

entities, including the Bank of Greece, as a means 

of containing the adverse effects of the ongoing 

budgetary crisis. The Slovenian authorities failed 

to consult the ECB on legislation related to the 

provision of state guarantees and loans to credit 

institutions. The ECB considers that these cases 
are of general signiÞ cance to the ESCB, as they 
concern the Þ nancial crisis and rescue measures 
undertaken by Member States. 
As of 2010 information regarding clear and 
repetitive cases of failure by Member States to 

consult the ECB is also included in the Annual 

Report. Repetitive cases are those where the 

same Member State fails to consult the ECB at 

least three times in two consecutive years, with 

at least one case of non-consultation in each 

year under consideration. The ECB recorded, 

for both Greece and Hungary, two cases of 

non-consultation on draft national legislation in 

2009 and three cases in 2010.6.3 ADMINISTRATION OF THE BORROWING AND 
LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN

medium-term Þ nancial assistance facility as at 
31 December 2010 was •12.1 billion.In the context of the loan facility agreement between the Member States whose currency is 
the euro 64 and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) 65 as lenders and the Hellenic Republic as borrower and the Bank of Greece as agent to the 
borrower, and pursuant to Articles 17 and 21.2 
of the Statute of the ESCB and Article 2 of 
Decision ECB/2010/4 of 10 May 2010, the ECB 
is responsible for processing all related payments 
on behalf of the lenders and the borrower. 
In 2010 the ECB received two disbursement 
payments from the lenders and transferred these 
amounts to the borrower. For both loans, interest 
payments became due and were processed by 
the ECB accordingly. The balance outstanding 
as at 31 December 2010 in respect of the pooled 
bilateral loans for the beneÞ t of the Hellenic 
Republic amounted to •21 billion.In accordance with Articles 122(2) and 132(1) of the Treaty, Articles 17 and 21 of the 
Statute of the ESCB, and Article 8 of Council 
Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 of 11 May 2010, 
the ECB is responsible for the administration 
of the borrowing and lending operations of the 
EU under the European Financial Stabilisation 
Mechanism (EFSM). The ECB opened an 
account for the European Commission in this 
context in accordance with Article 2 of Decision 
ECB/2010/17 of 14 October 2010. No operations 

were carried out under the EFSM in 2010.In accordance with Articles 17 and 21 of the Statute of the ESCB (in conjunction with 
Article 3(5) of the EFSF Framework Agreement), 
the ECB is responsible for the administration of 
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) 
loans to Member States whose currency is the 
euro. The ECB opened an account for the EFSF 
in this context in accordance with Article 1 
of Decision ECB/2010/15 of 21 September 2010. 

No operations were carried out under the 
EFSF in 2010.6.4 EUROSYSTEM RESERVE MANAGEMENT 
SERVICESIn 2010 a comprehensive set of services 
continued to be offered within the framework 
established in 2005 for the management of 
Eurosystem customers™ euro-denominated 
reserve assets. The complete set of services Œ 
which is available to central banks, monetary 
authorities and government agencies located 
outside the euro area, as well as to international 
organisations Œ is offered under harmonised 
terms and conditions in line with general market 
standards by individual Eurosystem central 
banks (the Eurosystem service providers). 
The ECB performs an overall coordinating 
role, ensuring the smooth functioning of

INTO THE EURO AREA128ECBAnnual Report
20101 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS
IN ESTONIAOn 13 July 2010 the Council of the European Union adopted a decision allowing Estonia 
to adopt the euro as its currency from 
1 January 2011, increasing the number of euro 
area countries from 16 to 17. The Council™s 
decision was based on the convergence reports 
published by the ECB and the European 
Commission in May 2010, and followed 
discussions by the European Council, an opinion 
of the European Parliament, a proposal from the 
European Commission and a recommendation 
by the Eurogroup. On the same day, the Council 
also adopted a regulation Þ xing the irrevocable 
conversion rate between the Estonian kroon 
and the euro. This conversion rate was set at 
EEK 15.6466 to the euro. This was also the 
central rate of the Estonian kroon throughout 
the country™s membership of the exchange rate 
mechanism II (ERM II). For several years, Estonia was one of the EU™s fastest-growing economies. However, the 
strong economic expansion, with clear signs of overheating throughout 2005-07, proved 
unsustainable. In 2007 economic growth already 
started to decelerate but remained strong. 
Owing to these unsustainable macroeconomic 
developments and the collapse of world trade, 
Estonia experienced a pronounced turnaround 
in economic activity and a severe contraction in 
2009 (see Table 14). As a consequence, Estonia 
underwent a signiÞ cant economic adjustment 
that contributed to the unwinding of some of 
the external and internal imbalances that had 
built up in the years of very fast growth. In 2010 
economic activity started to recover: annual 
real GDP growth turned positive in the second 
quarter of 2010 and stood at 6.6% in the fourth 
quarter. Looking at external developments, 
Estonia recorded a very large average deÞ cit of 10% of GDP in the combined current and 
capital account balance between 2000 and 
2008. Correcting these large deÞ cits has been 
a key feature of the necessary adjustment 
process that Estonia has been undergoing 
following the overheating period. After a strong Table 14 Main economic indicators for Estonia

2010fall in domestic demand, which led to lower imports, the deÞ cit decreased and turned into 
a surplus, which stood at 8.4% of GDP in the 
third quarter of 2010. The inß ation performance of the Estonian 
economy over the past decade has been very volatile. HICP inß ation, which had followed 
a broadly downward trend between the 
mid-1990s and 2003, started to rise in 2004 as 
a result of hikes in administered prices, partly 
related to EU accession, rising energy prices and 
signs of overheating. In 2008, despite a sharp 
slowdown in growth, inß ation continued to 
increase and peaked at 10.6%, reß ecting the rise 
in global commodity prices, tax harmonisation 
measures and the lagged response of wages to 
the changing economic environment. As the 
economy edged further into recession, annual 
inß ation declined rapidly and turned negative 
during some months, reaching 0.2% on average 
in 2009. In the second half of 2010 HICP 
inß ation increased signi
Þ cantly again, re
ß ecting the impact of higher commodity prices in 
world markets, increases in administered prices 
and excise duties, as well as the recovery in 
economic activity. For 2010 as a whole, HICP 
inß ation stood at 2.7%.
Reß ecting the sharp economic adjustment of 
recent years, Estonia™s unemployment rate is 
currently high, standing at 13.6% on average in 
the fourth quarter of 2010. While the Estonian 
labour market is relatively ß exible, regional 
differences in employment and unemployment 
and skill mismatches continue to persist. 
These factors contributed to high wage growth 
over the period 2005-08. Weak economic 
activity and the increase in unemployment have 
supported the sharp deceleration of growth 
in both private and public sector wages. This 
adjustment is necessary to ensure that the 
temporarily high level of unemployment in 
Estonia does not become permanent. Over the period from 2000 to 2009, Estonia generally ran a sound Þ scal policy, thereby 
achieving budgets close to balance or in surplus 
until 2007. Nevertheless, the general government balance deteriorated in 2008 in conjunction with 
the marked economic downturn. The public 
deÞ cit increased to 2.8% of GDP in 2008 
and then declined to 1.7% of GDP in 2009, 
on account of signiÞ cant consolidation measures 
undertaken by the government, which amounted 
to around 9% of GDP (of which approximately 
one-third are estimated to be of a temporary 
nature). The deÞ cit was then among the lowest 
of the euro area in 2009 and Estonia is one of 
the few EU countries currently not subject 
to an excessive deÞ cit procedure. The public 
debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 7.2% of GDP in 
2009. According to the European Commission, 
in 2010 the Estonian public deÞ cit is likely to 
decrease to 1.0% of GDP, while gross public 
debt is projected at 8.0% of GDP. Looking 
forward, additional consolidation measures 
should be speciÞ ed in order to return to a surplus 
position in line with the medium-term objective 
by 2013, thereby allowing Estonia to maintain 
its sustainable public Þ nance position.
Economic and monetary policy choices 
have played an important role in shaping the 
convergence process of Estonia over the past 
decade. With the adoption of a currency board 
arrangement in 1992, the kroon was pegged Þ rst to the Deutsche Mark, and after 1999 it was 
pegged to the euro. In addition, the orientation 
of monetary policy towards the achievement 
of price stability, as the primary objective of 
monetary policy, was enshrined in the central 
bank law in 2003. During the period 2005-08, 
however, the monetary policy conditions in 
Estonia under the currency board arrangement 
became, overall, too expansionary. Despite 
a relatively sound record of Þ scal balances, 
the country™s overall policy stance was not 
sufÞ ciently tight to contain demand pressures 
and support price stability. This led to excessive 
credit growth and increases in asset prices, 
notably in housing markets, with the resulting 
imbalances being unwound in the context of a 
severe adjustment recession.The policy framework of Eesti Pank implied 
that ECB interest rate decisions were directly 

inß uencing the interest rate for the Estonian 
130ECBAnnual Report
2010economy. For many years, money market 
interest rates in Estonia had broadly followed 

comparable euro area rates. However, 

following the intensiÞ cation of the 
Þ nancial 
crisis in the autumn of 2008, risk premia rose, 

market rates became increasingly detached 

from euro area money markets and spreads 

vis-à-vis the euro area increased. From 

November 2009 money market spreads started 

to narrow signiÞ cantly Œ re
ß ecting Þ scal 
consolidation efforts, a decline in global risk 

aversion and changing market expectations 

about Estonia™s prospects of adopting the 

euro. Amid some ß uctuations, this narrowing 
gradually led to the convergence of Estonian 

money market interest rates with the euro area.In order to fully reap the advantages of the euro and to allow adjustment mechanisms to 
operate efÞ ciently within the enlarged currency 
area, Estonia needs to conduct economic policies that are fully geared towards ensuring 
the sustainability of the convergence process. 
Ensuring a low-inß ation environment is crucial 
in that respect. It is imperative that policy 
areas other than monetary policy provide the 
Estonian economy with the ability to cope with 
potential country-speciÞ c shocks and avoid the 
reoccurrence of macroeconomic imbalances. 
Importantly, the Estonian authorities have 
publicly underlined that their overarching goal 
is to ensure an economic environment that is 
conducive to sustainable output and employment 
growth in the medium term, in the context of 
balanced macroeconomic conditions, and price 
stability. To this end, the Estonian authorities 
need to be Þ rmly committed to a framework 
consisting of: i) further Þ scal consolidation, 
ii) continuing structural reform, and iii) a further 
strengthening of Þ nancial sector policies to 
ensure Þ nancial stability and avoid the build-up 
of possible risks.Box 9STATISTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EURO AREA TO INCLUDE ESTONIAEstonia™s entry into the euro area on 1 January 2011 is the Þ fth occasion on which statistical 
series for the euro area have had to be amended to include additional member countries 
(Greece entered in 2001, Slovenia in 2007, Cyprus and Malta in 2008, and Slovakia in 2009). 
The preparation of statistics for the enlarged euro area has been coordinated, where necessary, 
with the European Commission.The entry of Estonia into the euro area means that Estonian residents Œ both natural and legal persons Œ have become residents of the euro area. This affects statistics recording transactions 
(ß ows) and positions of euro area residents among themselves and vis-à-vis non-euro area 
residents, such as monetary, balance of payments and international investment position statistics, 
as well as Þ nancial accounts. In these cases, transactions and positions between residents of 
Estonia and other euro area residents must now be ﬁconsolidatedﬂ to ensure a proper deÞ nition of 
euro area residency in all statistics concerned.As of January 2011 Estonia has to meet all the statistical requirements of the ECB, i.e. to provide fully harmonised and comparable national data.1 Since the preparatory work for new statistics requires a long lead time, Eesti Pank and the ECB started the statistical preparations well before 
Estonia joined the EU. After becoming a member of the ESCB in 2004, Eesti Pank intensiÞ ed its preparations to fulÞ l the requirements of the ECB in the 
Þ elds of monetary and 
Þ nancial 1 The statistical requirements of the ECB are summarised in the document ﬁECB statistics: an overviewﬂ, April 2010.

2010statistics, external statistics, government Þ nance statistics and 
Þ nancial accounts. In addition, 
it had to carry out the necessary preparations for the integration of Estonian credit institutions into the ECB™s minimum reserve system and to fulÞ l the relevant statistical requirements in 
this area.For the data reporters and NCBs of the other euro area countries, the enlargement of the euro area means that since January 2011 they have to report transactions (or ß ows) and positions 
vis-à-vis residents of Estonia as part of the euro area data, instead of transactions and positions 
vis-à-vis non-euro area residents as they did earlier. In addition, Estonia and all other euro area countries provided backdata with sufÞ cient geographical and sectoral detail, dating back as far as 2004, the year Estonia joined the EU. These historical data will enable the compilation of aggregates for the euro area in its new composition 
for a few years before the enlargement.Regarding the publication of euro area statistics, the ECB has granted users online access to two sets of time series, one containing data for the current euro area (i.e. including Estonia) as 
far back as available, and one linking the various compositions of the euro area, starting with the 
11 countries in 1999.132ECBAnnual Report
20102 LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE INTEGRATION
OF EESTI PANK INTO THE EUROSYSTEMPursuant to Article 140 of the Treaty, the ECB 
reviewed the statute of Eesti Pank and other 

relevant Estonian legislation for compliance 

with Article 131 of the Treaty. The ECB made 

a favourable assessment of the compatibility of 

Estonian legislation with the Treaty and with 

the Statute of the ESCB, under the assumption 

that further legislative amendments to Estonian 

legislation would enter into force in time, as 

stated in its Convergence Report published in 

May 2010. The ECB noted that on 22 April 2010 

the Estonian parliament adopted these legislative 

amendments.The ECB and Eesti Pank put in place a number of 
legal instruments with a view to ensuring the 

integration of Eesti Pank into the Eurosystem on 

1 January 2011. The Eurosystem™s legal 

framework was adapted as a consequence of the 

decision taken by the ECOFIN Council on 

13 July 2010 to abrogate the derogation of 

Estonia.1 The ECB adopted the necessary legal 
instruments to provide for the paying-up of the 

remaining capital and the transfer of foreign 

reserves to the ECB 2 and established the banknote 
allocation key applying from 1 January 2011.3 Pursuant to Article 27.1 of the Statute of the 

ESCB, the Governing Council adopted a 

recommendation on Eesti Pank™s external 

auditors for the annual accounts starting from the 

Þ nancial year 2011.
4 The ECB also reviewed its 
legal framework and introduced, where necessary, 

amendments resulting from Eesti Pank™s 

membership of the Eurosystem. This included a 

review of Estonian legislation implementing the 

Eurosystem™s legal framework for monetary 

policy and TARGET2, which enabled Estonian 

counterparties to participate in the Eurosystem™s 

open market operations from 3 January 2011. 

The ECB also adopted a decision on transitional 

provisions for the application of minimum 

reserves by the ECB following the introduction 

of the euro in Estonia.5 Finally, the ERM II 
Agreement 6 was terminated for Eesti Pank. 
The introduction of the euro in Estonia and the 

integration of its central bank into the Eurosystem 

also required changes to some Estonian legal 

instruments. The ECB was consulted on national 
legislation governing the euro changeover, 

rounding rules and currency circulation in Estonia, 

as well as the minimum reserves framework.7 By the end of 2010 Eesti Pank™s law and statute 
had been brought into line with recommendations 
in the ECB™s 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 
Convergence Reports. Eesti Pank consulted the 
ECB on the draft amendments to the law and the 
statute of Eesti Pank on 10 February 2010 and 
the ECB adopted an opinion proposing certain 
changes, which were reß ected in the 
Þ nal version of the law and the statute.8 The ECOFIN Council consulted the ECB on its 
proposals to amend the Council Regulations 9 which enabled the introduction of the euro in 
Estonia and determined the irrevocably Þ xed exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the Estonian 
kroon.10 The ECB welcomed the proposed regulations and noted that they would enable 
the introduction of the euro as the currency of 
Estonia following the abrogation of Estonia™s 
derogation in accordance with the procedure set 
out in Article 140(2) of the Treaty.Council Decision 2010/416/EU of 13 July 2010 in accordance 1 with Article 140(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Estonia of the euro on 1 January 2011, OJ L 196, 28.7.2010, p. 24.

20103 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE INTEGRATION 
OF EESTI PANK INTO THE EUROSYSTEM 
Following the ECOFIN Council™s decision 
of 13 July 2010 on the adoption of the euro by 

Estonia on 1 January 2011, the ECB conducted 

technical preparations with a view to fully 

integrating Eesti Pank into the Eurosystem. 

In line with the provisions of the Treaty, Eesti 

Pank joined the Eurosystem with exactly the same 

rights and obligations as the NCBs of the EU 

Member States that had already adopted the euro.The technical preparations for the integration of Eesti Pank into the Eurosystem covered a wide 
range of areas, notably Þ nancial reporting and 
accounting, monetary policy operations, foreign 
reserve management and foreign exchange 
operations, payment systems, statistics and 
banknote production. In the Þ eld of operations, 
preparations involved extensive testing of the 
instruments, procedures and technical systems 
for the implementation of monetary policy and 
foreign exchange operations. MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS 
Following the adoption of the euro by Estonia 
on 1 January 2011, 18 Estonian credit 
institutions, a list of which is published on 
the ECB™s website, became subject to the 
Eurosystem™s reserve requirements as from 
that date. The entry of Estonia into the euro 
area changed the liquidity conditions in the 
Eurosystem only slightly. The aggregate reserve 
requirements of euro area credit institutions 
increased by less than 0.2% (•223 million). Net 
autonomous liquidity factors in Estonia for the 
period from 1 to 18 January 2011 were liquidity-
absorbing, increasing the liquidity needs of the 
entire euro area banking sector by •1.1 billion 
on average. Given the liquidity surplus, Estonian counterparties did not submit any bids in 
the open market operations conducted at the 
beginning of 2011, except for a small amount in 

the operation that was settled on 19 January.On entering the euro area, Eesti Pank also adopted 
the collateral framework of the Eurosystem, but 

reported no assets to be eligible for Eurosystem 

credit operations as at 1 January 2011.CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECB’S CAPITAL, RESERVES 

AND FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETSEesti Pank™s total subscribed share amounts 
to •19.3 million, equivalent to 0.1790% of the 
ECB™s subscribed capital of •10.761 billion 
as at 1 January 2011. Upon joining the ESCB 
on 1 May 2004, Eesti Pank paid up 7% of its 
share of the subscribed capital of the ECB as 
a contribution to the ECB™s operational costs; 
in conjunction with the ECB™s capital increase 
on 29 December 2010 this contribution has 
been reduced to 3.75%. In accordance with 
Article 48.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
Eesti Pank is asked to pay up the remaining 
part of its subscription, which is equal to 
•18.5 million. On 1 January 2011 Eesti Pank 
paid up the Þ rst instalment of its subscription, 
equal to •12.6 million, and the rest of the 
subscribed capital will be paid in two further 
instalments.At the beginning of 2011, in accordance with Articles 30 and 48.1 of the Statute of the 
ESCB, Eesti Pank, on the basis of its share of 
the ECB™s subscribed capital, transferred to 
the ECB foreign reserve assets equivalent to 
a total of •145.9 million (85% in Japanese 
yen-denominated assets and 15% in gold). 
Eesti Pank has opted to conduct the operational 
activities related to the management of its 
share of the ECB™s Japanese yen reserve 
assets in a pooled management arrangement 
with Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank. As a 
result of the transfer of foreign reserve assets 
to the ECB, Eesti Pank was credited with a 
euro-denominated claim on the ECB in 
accordance with Article 30.3 of the Statute of 
the ESCB.134ECBAnnual Report
20104 THE CASH CHANGEOVER IN ESTONIA
THE LOGISTICS OF THE CASH CHANGEOVERFollowing the abrogation of the derogation for Estonia by the ECOFIN Council on 
13 July 2010, Estonia adopted the euro as 
its currency on 1 January 2011. The cash 
changeover went smoothly and, following a 
two-week period during which Estonian kroon 
and euro cash circulated in parallel, the euro 
banknotes and coins became the sole legal 
tender in Estonia. Virtually all automated 
teller machines (ATMs) only dispensed euro 
banknotes as of 1 January 2011. The cash 
changeover modalities had been laid down in 
a changeover plan established jointly with the 
relevant stakeholders. Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank, which acted as the logistical counterpart, provided 44.9 million 
banknotes worth •1.47 billion. Eesti Pank will 
repay that loan in the form of banknotes in 
2012. The banknotes to be commissioned by 
Eesti Pank will carry the letter ﬁDﬂ in their serial 
numbers. Eesti Pank procured 194 million euro 
coins worth •58.4 million from the Mint of 
Finland.In terms of value, 13% of the borrowed euro 
banknotes and nearly half of the procured euro 

coins were frontloaded to the banking sector 

for Þ lling the ATMs and for sub-frontloading. 
In addition, 700,000 starter kits each containing 

euro coins with a value of •12.79 were produced 

for distribution to the general public in order 

to reduce the amount of change to be kept by 

retailers in the Þ rst few days of January.
In connection with the introduction of the euro 
in Estonia, NCBs exchanged, free of charge, 
Estonian kroons for euro at par value from 
the Þ rst working day of 2011 until 
28 February 2011.11 The amount exchanged was limited to •1,000 for any given party and 
transaction on any one day. Furthermore, in 
December 2010 individuals were able to 
exchange kroons for euro free of charge at the 
irrevocably Þ xed exchange rate at all banks in 
Estonia. Estonian post ofÞ ces also took part in 
the changeover process during the Þ rst 15 days 
of January to ensure cash supply in 
rural areas. From 1 January 2011, for a period of six months, kroons can be exchanged for euro at the Þ xed exchange rate free of charge at all bank branches 
providing cash services. Thereafter, from July to 
December 2011, kroons can be exchanged for 
euro at certain bank branches.Eesti Pank will continue to redeem Estonian kroon banknotes and coins for an unlimited 
period of time.THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON THE 

INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO 
The ECB worked closely with Eesti Pank to 
prepare a comprehensive information campaign 
in preparation for the introduction of the euro. 
The communication tools used in the campaign 
took into account the experience gained in 
past changeovers and included public opinion 
surveys, different types of printed publication 
and dedicated internet pages. For the Þ rst time 
since the Euro 2002 Information Campaign, 
TV advertising was used (four adverts were 
aired between November 2010 and mid-January 
2011). The euro information campaign organised 
by the ECB and Eesti Pank aimed to familiarise 
cash handlers and the general public with the 
visual appearance and security features of the 
euro banknotes and coins, as well as with the 
cash changeover arrangements. Communication 
partners (mainly banks and public authorities) 
were given access to the high-quality print 
Þ les of the ECB™s publications, which they 
were able to adapt and use in their own 
communication activities. Following contacts with blind associations, including the Estonian Blind Association, the 
ECB developed a ﬁtalking cardﬂ for the visually Article 52 of the Statute of the ESCB requires that the Governing 11 Council of the ECB take the necessary measures to ensure that banknotes denominated in currencies with irrevocably Þ xed exchange rates to the euro are exchanged by the euro area NCBs 
at par value. Against this background, the Governing Council 
adopted a guideline on the exchange of such banknotes on 
24 July 2006.135ECBAnnual Report

AND INTEGRATION138ECBAnnual Report
2010The Eurosystem contributes to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent 
national authorities relating to the prudential 
supervision of credit institutions and the 
stability of the Þ nancial system. It also provides 
advice to these authorities and the European 
Commission on the scope and implementation 
of EU legislation in these Þ elds. Following 
the establishment of the European Systemic 
Risk Board (ESRB) on 16 December 2010, 
the new European supervisory framework came 
into being on 1 January 2011 with the creation 
of three European Supervisory Authorities 
(ESAs) covering banks, securities markets, 
and insurance and pension funds. This framework 
will produce a substantial strengthening of 
the European supervisory structure both at 
the micro-prudential and, for the Þ rst time, 
at the macro-prudential level, as the ESRB has 
been given a mandate to identify and prioritise 
systemic risks to the EU Þ nancial sector, to issue 
warnings and, where appropriate, to suggest 
recommendations for remedial action to contain 
those risks. The ECB will ﬁensure the secretariat 
of the ESRB and thereby provide analytical, 
statistical, logistical and administrative support 
to the ESRBﬂ (see Chapter 6).11.1 FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING 
1.1.1 THE EURO AREA BANKING SECTOR
The key activities of the ECB, in collaboration with the ESCB™s Banking Supervision 
Committee (BSC), are monitoring risks to 
Þ nancial stability and assessing the 
Þ nancial system™s shock-absorbing capacity.2 The main focus of the analysis is on banks, as they remain 
the primary Þ nancial intermediaries in Europe. 
However, owing to the increasing importance of 
Þ nancial markets, 
Þ nancial infrastructures and 
other Þ nancial institutions, and their linkages 
with banks, vulnerabilities in these components 
of the Þ nancial system also need to be monitored 
by the ESCB.During 2010 continued distress in the euro area 
government bond and bank funding markets 

tested market conÞ dence in the ability of the euro 
area banking sector to deal with future risks. 

However, the commitment of euro area countries 

to undertake or accelerate Þ scal consolidation, the 
establishment of the European Financial 

Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the 

European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), 

the launch of the ECB™s Securities Markets 

Programme (SMP) in May, under which 

interventions are conducted in the euro area public 

and private debt securities markets, and the overall 

positive results of the EU-wide stress tests that 

were announced in July all made important 

contributions to the stabilisation of markets over 

the summer.3 Moreover, the conclusion of an 
agreement on a revision of the regulatory regimes 

for internationally active banks (the Basel III 

rules), to be implemented gradually over time so 

that the banking sector can keep providing credit 

to the economy, reduced uncertainty about the 

future capital and liquidity needs of banks. These 

developments notwithstanding, the overall 

economic and Þ nancial situation in the euro area 
remained fraught with risks for Þ nancial stability, 
and concerns about the interplay between 

sovereign debt problems and banking sector 

vulnerabilities in some euro area countries re-
emerged in the second half of the year.4 Furthermore, the re-emergence of global 

imbalances during 2010 represented another 

important source of risks, along with the associated 

high exchange rate volatility and the possibility of 

disorderly unwinding of the imbalances.Council Regulation (EU) No 1096/2010 of 17 November 2010, 1 OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 162.Since the end of 2004 the ECB has published its Financial 2 Stability Review, a semi-annual report on the stability of the 
euro area Þ nancial system. In 2010 it also published structural 
indicators for the EU banking sector, its annual report on EU 
banking sector stability and its annual report on EU banking 
structures, which this year included an ad hoc appendix on the 
proÞ tability of banks, ﬁBeyond RoE: How to measure bank 
performanceﬂ. These publications present the main Þ ndings of 
the monitoring by the BSC of the structure and stability of the 
banking sector, and are available on the ECB™s website.
The EU-wide stress test exercise was coordinated by the 3 Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in close 
collaboration with the ECB and the European Commission. 
Detailed descriptions of the methodology are available on 
the websites of the CEBS and the ECB, and the results are 
available on the websites of the CEBS and participating national 
authorities.
This interplay culminated in Ireland applying for an EU/IMF 4 Þ nancial support programme on 21 November.
1 FINANCIAL STABILITY
139ECBAnnual Report
2010Notably, developments in the euro area Þ nancial 
sector in 2010 pointed to signiÞ cant discrepancies 
between member countries, which to a large 
extent reß ected the ongoing process of correction 
of past imbalances in some countries. In such an 

environment, the timing and phasing of exits from 

remaining public sector support measures posed 

particular challenges for the euro area Þ nancial 
system. However, those measures will have to 

be withdrawn over the medium term; otherwise 

they would maintain an uneven playing Þ eld 
between banks and between countries. In the 

meantime, the main risks continued to include the 

possibility that concerns about the sustainability 

of public Þ nances would persist or even increase, 
with a potential for further adverse feedback 

loops between public Þ nances and the 
Þ nancial 
sector. Although the adverse interaction between 

vulnerabilities relating to economic growth, Þ scal 
imbalances and bank funding conditions was 

particularly prevalent in only a limited number of 

euro area countries, risks of contagion spreading 

to other euro area countries remained.Nonetheless, going forward, the central scenario 
for euro area Þ nancial stability is broadly 
favourable, supported in part by a more benign 

macroeconomic environment, by the increased 

transparency of Þ nancial institutions™ asset 
exposures and by additional Þ nancial backstop 
mechanisms set up by euro area governments and 

central banks. However, the degree of uncertainty 

surrounding this outlook remains high.The earnings of euro area large and complex 
banking groups (LCBGs) started to recover 

in the Þ rst three quarters of 2010, mainly 
driven by buoyant net interest income, lower 

(albeit still high) average loan loss provisions, 

and steady fee and commission income. 

Net interest income continued to be supported 

by the steep yield curve and the still relatively 

wide margins applied by banks to new lending. 

In addition, indications emerged that growth 

in bank lending for house purchase may have 

passed a turning point in mid-2010, albeit 

with substantial differences between member 

countries, while bank lending to non-Þ nancial 
corporations recovered far more sluggishly. 
Finally, LCBGs beneÞ ted from a signi
Þ cant 
decrease in the cost of risk, due both to a positive 

evolution of the credit cycle and to the economic 

recovery (e.g. a stabilisation of default rates 

and lower non-performing loans). However, 

LCBGs experienced a remarkable drop in 

trading revenues in the second quarter of 2010, 

which was only partially reversed in the third 

quarter. This was driven by lower trading 

volumes, and many institutions continued to 

post losses on some of their asset holdings. 

The solvency ratios of LCBGs improved further 

across the board in the Þ rst three quarters 
of 2010, supported by retained earnings and 

banks™ efforts to raise capital. A setback to the 

recent recovery in the proÞ tability of LCBGs 
would adversely impact the provision of credit 

to the real economy. Moreover, the recovery 

in the quality of banks™ credit risk exposures 

remains fragile in a number of countries. 
1.1.2 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Turning to other Þ nancial institutions, 
the condition of the euro area insurance sector 
stabilised in 2010. However, the performance 
across insurers was varied and the moderate 
economic activity continued to weigh on 
underwriting performance. Insurers™ Þ nancial results were, however, supported by relatively 
contained losses and stable investment income. 
All in all, the proÞ tability of large insurers 
remained stable throughout 2010. In addition, 
capital positions also remained steady and 
appeared, on average, to include a reasonable 
amount of shock-absorption capacity. Looking ahead, some risks and challenges for the euro area insurance sector remain, and this 
is contributing to some uncertainty about the 
outlook. In particular, the low levels of yields on 
AAA-rated government bonds continue to pose 
challenges for insurers (and pension funds) that 
have a large stock of guaranteed-return contracts 
with guaranteed rates close to or above current 
long-term risk-free rates. At the same time, 
the moderate recovery in economic activity, 
and the uncertainty surrounding it, is continuing 
to weigh on the underwriting performance of 
euro area insurers.140ECBAnnual Report
2010The hedge fund sector continued to recover in 2010. Average investment performances 
were not as impressive as in 2009, but investors 
continued to return to the sector and annual net 
ß ows became positive again. However, investors 
tended to prefer larger hedge funds, the growth of 
which may also imply higher concomitant risks 
to Þ nancial stability. Furthermore, amid low 
nominal interest rates and increasing tolerance 
of counterparty credit risk across prime broker 
banks, the limited data available on hedge fund 
leverage pointed to a gradual releveraging of 
the hedge fund sector with the associated higher 
vulnerability to various leverage-related risks.1.2 FINANCIAL STABILITY ARRANGEMENTS
In 2010 the EU launched a major overhaul 
of the EU framework for crisis prevention, 
management and resolution. The reform Œ 
covering a time horizon of a few years, as laid 
down in the ECOFIN Council conclusions of 
18 May 2010 Œ focuses on three main areas of 
work: i) the implementation of an EU policy 
coordination framework, ii) the enhancement 
of the EU regulatory framework, and iii) the 
establishment of mechanisms to ensure that the 
Þ nancial sector bears the net cost of 
Þ nancial crises. The ECB has participated actively in all 
three areas throughout the year.In particular, the ECB supported the implementation of a holistic EU-wide policy 
coordination framework for crisis prevention, 
management and resolution, implying a 
stronger coordinating role for the ECOFIN 
Council in Þ nancial stability policies, as well 
as the setting-up of coordination arrangements 
for the clear articulation of the roles and 
responsibilities of the various EU and national 
bodies. In that context, the establishment of 
cross-border stability groups (CBSGs) Œ 
as deÞ ned in the 2008 memorandum of 
understanding on cross-border Þ nancial stability 5 Œ for all large EU cross-border Þ nancial groups by mid-2011, accompanied 
by the signing of cross-border cooperation 
agreements (ﬁVoluntary SpeciÞ c Cooperation 
Agreementsﬂ), was considered useful for 
strengthening policy coordination on a bilateral/
multilateral basis.6 In the Þ eld of regulation, in February 2010 the 
Eurosystem contributed to the Commission™s 
public consultation on an EU framework 
for cross-border crisis management in the 
banking sector.7 The Eurosystem supported the Commission™s objective of taking the initiative 
to develop an EU resolution framework and to 
address obstacles to the effective management 
of crises affecting EU cross-border Þ nancial institutions. The Eurosystem also suggested 
several possible ways to address issues in 
the areas of early intervention tools, intra-
group asset transfers, ﬁbank resolutionﬂ8 and insolvency. In May 2010 the Commission published its ﬁCommunication on bank resolution fundsﬂ, 
suggesting the establishment of an EU-wide 
network of prefunded schemes as the best use of 
Þ nancial levies to ensure that future bank 
failures do not come at the cost of the taxpayers 
or destabilise the Þ nancial system. In the same 
vein, the European Council agreed in June that 
Member States should introduce systems of 
levies and taxes on Þ nancial institutions to 
ensure fair burden-sharing and to create 
incentives to contain systemic risk.9 In that context, the ECB acknowledged the need to See Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation 5 between the Financial Supervisory Authorities, Central Banks and Finance Ministries of the European Union on 
Cross-Border Financial Stability (ECFIN/CEFCPE(2008)
REP/53106), Brussels, 1 June 2008.
On 17 August 2010 the Þ rst CBSG Œ the Nordic-Baltic 
6 Cross-Border Stability Group Œ was set up with the signing 
of an agreement between the authorities of Denmark, Estonia, 
Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden.
On 20 October 2009 the European Commission launched a public 7 consultation on its communication entitled ﬁAn EU Framework 
for Cross-Border Crisis Management in the Banking Sectorﬂ, 
which addresses a range of issues in three main areas: i) early 
intervention, ii) bank resolution, and iii) insolvency.
ﬁBank resolutionﬂ refers to measures taken by national resolution 8 authorities to manage a crisis in a banking institution, to contain 
its impact on Þ nancial stability and, where appropriate, 
to facilitate an orderly winding-up of the whole or parts of the 
institution.
With the exception of the Czech Republic, which reserved the 9 right not to introduce these measures.141ECBAnnual Report
2010ensure the coordination of the various initiatives already undertaken by countries to mitigate the 
risk of competitive distortions arising between 
national banking markets and of cross-border 
cooperation being hampered during crises. For 
this purpose, the ECB has actively contributed 
to the work of the Economic and Financial 
Committee (EFC) ad hoc working group on 
crisis management by monitoring the different 
systems of levies in the EU and providing 
recommendations on possible options to address 
short-term issues, such as double taxation and a 
level playing Þ eld.In October 2010 the Commission released a 
communication on ﬁAn EU Framework for 
Crisis Management in the Financial Sectorﬂ 
which sets out the main elements of the 
reform that will be part of EU legislative 
proposals in 2011. Beyond the immediate 
priority of putting in place efÞ cient crisis 
management arrangements in all Member States, 
the communication also includes a ﬁroadmapﬂ 
providing a longer-term view of some of the 
major challenges which will need to be overcome 
in order to ensure the smooth handling of crises. 
The Eurosystem supports the proposal put 
forward by the Commission aimed at enhancing 
the EU regulatory framework for crisis 
management and resolution. A comprehensive 
crisis management framework would ensure, 
inter alia, that, ultimately, resolution would be 
a credible option, even in the case of a 
systemically important cross-border institution. 
The achievement of this goal requires not only a 
more effective toolkit for authorities, but also 
provisions that foster cooperation between 
Member States in crisis situations. A public 
consultation on the technical details of this 
proposal was launched by the Commission 
on 6 January 2011.10 In December 2010, in its conclusions on crisis prevention, management 
and resolution, the ECOFIN Council supported 
the Commission in its forthcoming legislative 
work, and invited the EFC to continue its 
monitoring of national systems of levies and 
taxes, in particular with regard to a level playing 

Þ eld and coordination.

20102 FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
2.1 BANKINGDuring 2010 banking regulation followed the agenda set by the G20 at the London 
and Pittsburgh summits in 2009 with the 
Þ nal objective of building a more resilient 
Þ nancial system that supports strong and stable 
economic growth. To this end, the Group of 
Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), 
the oversight body of the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision, agreed on a substantial strengthening of existing capital requirements 
and the introduction of global liquidity risk 
regulation.12 This reform package, commonly referred to as ﬁBasel IIIﬂ, is a cornerstone of the 
new international prudential framework. The Basel III package includes a new deÞ nition of regulatory capital which focuses on those elements with the highest loss-absorbing 
capacity, such as common equity and its 
equivalents for non-joint stock companies. 
In addition to this qualitative enhancement, 
the amount of capital required has also been 
increased signiÞ cantly. The new minimum 
common equity Tier 1 ratio has been set at 4.5% 
of risk-weighted assets, complemented by a 
capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to withstand 
future periods of stress. Together with other 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 equity elements, the effective 
total capital ratio will rise from the current 8% to 
10.5% of risk-weighted assets. An additional 
counter-cyclical buffer, to be activated in 
circumstances of excessive credit growth, could 
add up to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, 
depending on national developments in the credit 
cycle. In response to the Commission™s 
consultation on its proposal on counter-cyclical 
capital buffers, the Eurosystem supported work 
at the international and EU level with regard to 
developing a counter-cyclical capital buffer 
(CCB) mechanism and stressed the need 
for consistent implementation at the EU and 
international level. While ensuring a level 
international playing Þ eld by laying down the 
requirements for the setting of CCBs in as much 
detail as possible in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) itself, the ESRB and the 
European Banking Authority (EBA), in their 
respective roles within the European supervisory 
framework, could issue policy principles and 
technical standards to specify additional 
requirements that would allow the framework to 
be responsive to the evolution of the Þ nancial system and the different shocks it faces.13 Moreover, in line with the mandate of the 
G20, the risk-based requirements would 
be supplemented with a transparent and 
internationally comparable non-risk-based 
leverage ratio.The regulation of liquidity risk consists of two key quantitative standards, focusing on limiting 
misalignments in terms of short-term liquidity 
needs and imposing a structural, longer-term 
liquidity requirement with the aim of reducing 
banks™ dependence on wholesale and other 
volatile funding sources, and promoting 
stable longer-term funding. To facilitate 
the monitoring of the liquidity risks and the 
exchange of information between supervisors, 
the quantitative measures are supplemented 
with a set of monitoring tools.In line with these regulatory developments, 
the European Commission launched two 

consultations. The Þ rst was launched in February 
2010 and concerned proposed amendments 

to the CRD regarding liquidity standards, the 

deÞ nition of capital, leverage ratios, changes in 
the treatment of counterparty credit risk, counter-
cyclical measures (including through-the-cycle 

provisioning for expected credit losses), a single 

rulebook and systemically important Þ nancial 
institutions (SIFIs). The second consultation,

2010launched in October 2010, relates to the 
introduction of a counter-cyclical buffer. 
The ECB fully supports the GHOS agreement and considers it a crucial step towards 
successfully fulÞ lling the G20 mandate. 
The crisis clearly showed that measures to 
make the Þ nancial system more resilient should 
be a key priority. Notwithstanding the costs 
of regulatory reform, some of which are of a 
transient nature, the new framework will beneÞ t the global economy by substantially mitigating 
the risks associated with future Þ nancial crises.
Nonetheless, the ECB considers that the gradual 
implementation of the package, envisaged over 
the period 2013-19, will remain key and that 
any further development has to be evaluated 
against the set of measures already under way. 
During the transition period, capital measures, 
the liquidity ratios and the leverage ratio will 
require careful assessment with regard to their 
impact on particular business models, speciÞ c banking sectors, Þ nancial markets and economic 
growth. At the same time, special attention will 
have to be devoted to ensuring that the new rules 
are implemented consistently across different 
jurisdictions at the international level.In line with the G20 mandate, the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB) focused its efforts in 2010 

on another strand of work, namely developing 

a well-integrated framework to reduce the risks 

and externalities associated with SIFIs. The new 

framework will comprise the following building 

blocks: i) tools for the effective resolution of 

SIFIs, ii) more intensive and effective supervision 

and oversight, iii) robust core Þ nancial market 
infrastructures to reduce contagion risk, and 

iv) supplementary prudential and other 

requirements to enhance loss absorbency. 

In September 2010, in a press release following 

the agreement on the calibration of the new 

prudential regime, the GHOS remarked that SIFIs 

should have loss-absorbing capacity beyond the 

standards agreed in Basel III. 
The ECB welcomes and supports the work of the FSB in this important Þ eld. Given the 
global scale of the activities pursued by SIFIs, 
it remains crucial that the regulatory community 
cooperates closely, under the aegis of the FSB, 
to ensure a high degree of international 
consistency in this domain, in order to limit 
potential deviations from a level playing Þ eld and minimise the risks of regulatory arbitrage.2.2 SECURITIESIn 2010 work continued on hedge funds, credit 
rating agencies (CRAs) and short-selling 
regulation. The G20 reafÞ rmed its commitment 
to improving the oversight of hedge funds 
and CRAs.14 At the European level, concerns about the potential harm of short selling were 
addressed by the Committee of European 
Securities Regulators (CESR).15As regards hedge funds, agreement 16 on the Alternative Investment Fund Managers 
Directive (AIFM Directive) was reached in the 
Council in October, and on 11 November 2010 
the European Parliament voted in favour of the 
proposal. The objectives of the AIFM Directive 
are, inter alia: to ensure that all managers of 
alternative investment funds above a certain size 
are subject to appropriate authorisation and 
registration requirements; to improve risk 
management and governance safeguards; to 
enhance investor protection; and to design a 
frame work for monitoring macro-prudential 

risks. Subject to these requirements, AIFMs 
would obtain a passport allowing them to market 
funds to professional investors across the Single 
Market. The Eurosystem contribution to the 
European Commission™s consultation on hedge 
funds strongly welcomed more transparency and 
macro-prudential oversight of the hedge fund 
industry and stressed that the introduction of a 
comprehensive and harmonised regulatory 
framework for AIFMs in the EU could act The G-20 Toronto Summit Declaration14 , G20, 26-27 June 2010.

Committee.144ECBAnnual Report
2010as a Þ rst step towards a global consensus. 
Furthermore, it emphasised the importance of continuing the international dialogue in order to 
ensure a globally coordinated framework.17With regard to CRAs, the European Commission 
has issued a proposal to amend the existing CRA 
Regulation.18 In its opinion on the proposal,19 the ECB broadly welcomed the measures aimed 
at strengthening the regulatory framework, 
in particular that granting comprehensive 
powers to the European Securities and Markets 
Authority (ESMA) as regards the registration 
and surveillance of CRAs, and that concerning 
increased transparency and competition in 
the market for ratings of structured Þ nance instruments. In response to concerns regarding the impact of short selling in the extreme market conditions 
created by the Þ nancial crisis, regulatory 
authorities around the world adopted a series of 
measures. In Europe, the CESR proposed a 
pan-European disclosure regime in March 2010. 
The European Commission also published a 
consultation document on 14 June 2010. 
The Eurosystem™s reply of 5 August 2010 
welcomed the proposed transparency regime for 
EU shares. It was stressed that the ESMA, 
together with other appropriate authorities, 
should play a central role in emergency 
situations, and that short-selling bans or 

restrictions should be limited in time and scope 
to exceptional circumstances. The Eurosystem 
broadly supported their enforcement against 
settlement failures of uncovered short selling 
and the assignment of powers to competent 
authorities to allow them to restrict short selling 
temporarily. The Commission™s subsequent 
proposal for a regulation was aimed at increasing 
harmonisation, coordination and transparency, 
as well as reducing systemic risks, risks to 
market integrity and settlement risks.20 2.3 ACCOUNTINGThe main developments in 2010 related to the 
ongoing work of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in response 
to the request of the G20 to address weaknesses 
identiÞ ed in the wake of the 
Þ nancial crisis and 
to bring their standards more into line with one 
another.In response to the G20 request to improve the involvement of interested stakeholders in the 
standard-setting process, the IASB further 
increased its outreach efforts with a view to 
encouraging broad stakeholder involvement in 
standard-setting. In this context, on many occasions the ECB 
provided views to the IASB on several key 

accounting projects (notably the accounting of 

Þ nancial instruments) and, more generally, on the 
convergence efforts of the FASB and the IASB.In April 2010 the ECB provided comments on the IASB suggestion to accommodate regulatory 
concerns by introducing a ﬁregulatory income 
statementﬂ. The ECB stressed the importance 
of maintaining the good collaboration between 
the IASB and regulators on the issues of fair 
value measurement and forward-looking 
provisioning within the accounting framework. 
On the other hand, the ECB did not support the 
introduction of a regulatory income statement, 
since the disclosure requirements of the new 
capital framework (Basel III) already address 
the disclosure issues raised by the IASB in its 
proposal and a regulatory income statement 
could potentially create additional complexity 
and uncertainty, and might result in confusion 
on the market, which should be avoided.Both the FASB and the IASB strengthened their efforts to reduce the complexity of European Commission™s consultation on hedge funds Œ 17 Eurosystem contribution, ECB, 25 February 2009.Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and 18 of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies.Opinion of the European Central Bank of 19 November 2010 on 19 a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of

In 2010 the two boards continued their work on strengthening the accounting recognition 
of loan loss provisions (impairment). In this 
regard, the ECB repeatedly conveyed its clear 
support for a move towards an expected loss 
model. In addition, the ECB continued to 
contribute to the accounting work of the Basel 
Committee, which is aimed, among other things, 
at addressing the operational challenges posed by 
the introduction of an expected loss approach. 146ECBAnnual Report
20103 FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
The Eurosystem contributes to enhancing European Þ nancial integration by: i) raising 
awareness of and monitoring Þ nancial integration, ii) acting as a catalyst for private 
sector activities by facilitating collective action, 
iii) giving advice on the legislative and regulatory 
framework for the Þ nancial system and direct 
rule-making, and iv) providing central banking 
services that foster Þ nancial integration. 
RAISING AWARENESS OF AND MONITORING 

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
In April 2010 the ECB published its fourth 
annual report on ﬁFinancial integration in 
Europeﬂ.21 The main purpose of the report is to contribute to the advancement of European 
Þ nancial integration and to raise public 
awareness of the Eurosystem™s role in supporting 
this process, providing information about the 
state of integration and thus an empirical basis 
for policy measures to further foster Þ nancial integration. The report Þ rst assesses the state of 
Þ nancial integration, based on a set of indicators 
that are also published semi-annually on the 
ECB™s website. In 2010 these indicators were 
further developed to include, for example, risk 
indicators for the bond market. The report also 
contains in-depth analyses of selected issues: 
i) banking integration and supervision in the EU, 
ii) European covered bonds, iii) harmonisation 
in the post-trading sector, and iv) stability 
implications of Þ nancial market integration 
and development. The report concludes with 
an overview of the Eurosystem™s contribution 
towards the achievement of more integrated 
and developed Þ nancial markets in Europe 
during 2009.The ECB continued its involvement in the Research Network on Capital Markets and 
Financial Integration in Europe, which brings 
together academics, market participants, 
policy-makers and central bankers, and is 
run in cooperation with the Center for 
Financial Studies at the University of 
Frankfurt. The network™s 13th conference on 
ﬁMacro-prudential Regulation as an Approach to 
Contain Systemic Risk: Economic Foundations, 
Diagnostic Tools and Policy Instrumentsﬂ took place on 27 and 28 September 2010 in Frankfurt 
and was hosted by the ECB. As in previous 
years, the ECB awarded Þ ve ﬁLamfalussy 
Fellowshipsﬂ to young researchers in the context 
of the network. The network™s current priorities 
are: i) Þ nancial systems as risk managers, 
risk distributors and risk creators, ii) the 
integration and development of retail Þ nancial services and the promotion of innovative Þ rms, and iii) Þ nancial modernisation and governance 
and the integration of the European Þ nancial system into global capital markets. ACTING AS A CATALYST FOR PRIVATE 

SECTOR ACTIVITIES 
SEPAThe Eurosystem continued to support the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) initiative, 
which aims to allow individuals, corporations 
and public administrations to make cashless 
payments in euro throughout the participating 
countries from a single account using a single 
set of payment instruments as easily, efÞ ciently and safely as they can make them today at the 
national level.The Eurosystem published the seventh SEPA Progress Report in October 2010.22 This report provides an assessment of the progress achieved 
in the implementation of SEPA since the 
publication of the previous report in 
November 2008, highlighting accomplishments 
and pointing out deÞ ciencies. Furthermore, 
in the annex to the report, the Eurosystem has 
identiÞ ed a (non-exhaustive) list of milestones 
that need to be attained between the 
fourth quarter of 2010 and the end of 2013 in 
order to facilitate the Þ nalisation of SEPA 
implementation and migration. The main 
conclusions of the report relate to the migration 
towards SEPA credit transfers (SCTs) and SEPA 
direct debits (SDDs), cards, innovation and the 
security of retail payments. For the latter, among 
other things, the Eurosystem has established Financial integration in Europe21 , ECB, April 2010.

2010a forum for monitoring market developments and fostering the harmonisation of security 
expectations in Europe. Furthermore, the 
Eurosystem welcomed the European 
Commission™s initiative to impose an end date 
for migration by means of an EU regulation.23The SEPA credit transfer scheme accounted for 
13.9% of total euro credit transfer payments in 
December 2010. In addition to the euro area 
SCT indicator, national SCT indicators show 
that the take-up of SCTs in individual countries 
still varies considerably.24 Furthermore, since the launch of the SEPA direct debit scheme in 
November 2009, the use of SDDs has remained 
fairly modest, amounting to well below 1% of 
all euro direct debits in December 2010.The introduction of the SCT and SDD schemes has laid foundations on which further 
innovations can be built, e.g. pan-European 
online payment solutions, mobile payments and 
e-invoicing. In 2010 the Eurosystem discussed 
the status of the various initiatives in the Þ eld of 
innovative payments with market participants. 
To this end, the ECB conducted an eSEPA 
online survey in cooperation with NCBs to gain 
an insight into the different solutions available 
in various countries.Further progress needs to be made, in particular in the area of SEPA for 
cards. One of the building blocks is the 
completion of the migration of chip cards, 
automated teller machines and point-of-sale 
terminals to the EMV standard 25, for which the industry set itself a deadline of the end of 
2010. According to the SEPA card indicators, 
a large number of countries have already 
achieved 100% migration to EMV. In 2010 a 
second meeting was held with stakeholders to 
discuss a SEPA certiÞ cation framework for cards 
and terminals with a view to achieving a single 
evaluation and certiÞ cation process. Moreover, 
the Eurosystem provided further clarity on the 
principle of the separation of card schemes from 
processing entities. The Eurosystem expects at 
least one additional European card scheme to 
emerge which meets its requirements and the requirements of the other stakeholders to achieve 
a competitive card market in SEPA; several 
market initiatives are already under way and 
their progress will continue to be monitored.In March 2010 the Eurosystem and the European Commission agreed on the creation of the SEPA 
Council with the aim of addressing the need for 
proper governance of the SEPA project and 
increasing the involvement of end users. 
This new overarching body is co-chaired by the 
ECB and the European Commission and brings 
together high-level representatives from the 
supply and demand sides of the payments 
market.26SECURITIES MARKETSThe market for short-term paper in Europe 
is largely domestic in nature. Since 2001 the 
Short-Term European Paper (STEP) initiative, 
pursued by market participants under the 
auspices of the European Banking Federation 
(EBF) and ACI Œ the Financial Markets 
Association Œ and steered by the STEP Market 

Committee, has promoted the integration of 
the short-term debt securities market through 
a voluntary core set of market standards and 
practices which can be applied to issuance 
programmes on existing markets such as the 
Euro Commercial Paper (ECP) market or the 
French commercial paper (TCN) market.The Eurosystem has supported STEP in two ways. First, until June 2010, on the basis of a 
temporary arrangement, the Eurosystem assisted 
the STEP Secretariat with the STEP-labelling of 
programmes, although ultimate responsibility For further details, see the section entitled ﬁAdvice on the 23 legislative and regulatory framework for the Þ nancial system and 
direct rule-makingﬂ later in this chapter.A critical mass, i.e. a market share of more than 50%, has only 24 been achieved in Luxembourg and Cyprus. In a further three 
countries (Slovenia, Belgium and Spain), the market share has 
reached double Þ gures.The ﬁEMV standardﬂ is a set of speciÞ cations developed by 
25 the consortium EMVCo, which is promoting the global 
standardisation of electronic Þ nancial transactions Œ in particular 
the global interoperability of chip cards. ﬁEMVﬂ stands 
for ﬁEuropay, MasterCard and Visaﬂ.

2010for granting and withdrawing the STEP label always rested fully with the STEP Secretariat. 
Since July 2010 the STEP Secretariat has 
managed the labelling process on its own. 
Second, the ECB provides statistics on the STEP 
market (see Section 4 of Chapter 2). STEP debt securities came through the Þ nancial market turmoil relatively unscathed and the total amount outstanding in December 2010 
was •411 billion, slightly above the total 
amount outstanding one year earlier. The 
steady development of the market is due to 
the fact that STEP criteria can be applied to 
other existing market programmes and that 
STEP is accepted by the Eurosystem as a non-
regulated market for collateral purposes. The 
decision of the ECB™s Governing Council in 
October 2008 to temporarily expand the list of 
assets eligible as collateral in Eurosystem credit 
operations to include STEP securities issued by 
credit institutions, i.e. certiÞ cates of deposit, 
was discontinued as from 1 January 2011.The STEP label was introduced in 2006, and there were 173 active STEP-labelled 
programmes in December 2010. In 2010, to increase transparency in the area of 
asset-backed securities (ABSs), the Eurosystem 

launched a public consultation on introducing 

an eligibility requirement for ABS originators 

so as to provide loan-level data on the assets 

underlying such instruments. The response 

to the consultation was generally positive 

and the ECB has continued to work towards 

the implementation of such a requirement. 

In December 2010 the Governing Council of 

the ECB decided to establish loan-by-loan 

information requirements for ABSs in the 

Eurosystem collateral framework. A well-
functioning securitisation market, backed by standardisation and enhanced transparency, will 

contribute to the completeness of the European 

Þ nancial system and foster integration through 
the improved comparability of instruments 

across borders.ADVICE ON THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY 

FRAMEWORK FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 

AND DIRECT RULE-MAKINGThe ECB has continued to participate in 
the European Commission™s Clearing and 
Settlement Advisory Monitoring Expert 
Group II (CESAME II) and its successor, 
the Expert Group on Market Infrastructures 
(EGMI). The EGMI has a mandate to contribute 
to the development of an efÞ cient, safe and sound 
post-trade market in the EU. This will be done by 
giving advice to the European Commission on 
various issues in relation to post-trade services 
and market infrastructures in the EU. This work 
is closely linked to the implementation of 
TARGET2-Securities (T2S), the Eurosystem™s 
planned platform for core, borderless and neutral 

securities settlement services, and is 
aimed 
at fostering harmonisation in the post-trade 
environment.Since harmonisation of the European legal framework for payments forms the basis for 
SEPA, the Eurosystem takes a strong interest in 
EU legislation in this area. The Eurosystem has 
repeatedly drawn attention to the need for an 
ambitious but realistic end date to be set for the 
migration to the SCT and SDD schemes in order 

to reap the beneÞ ts of SEPA. The Eurosystem 
has supported the Commission™s proposal to 
impose an end date for migration to SCTs and 
SDDs by means of an EU regulation.27 The Eurosystem expects the SCT and SDD schemes 

to become the credit transfer and direct debit 
schemes used for euro payments in the EU. 
After the migration end date, they will have 
replaced national legacy credit transfer and 
direct debit schemes for euro payments. See the European Commission™s proposal for a regulation of the 27 European Parliament and of the Council establishing technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euros and 
amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 (COM(2010) 775 Þ nal), available on the Commission™s website (http://ec.europa.eu). 149ECBAnnual Report
2010PROVIDING CENTRAL BANKING SERVICES WHICH 
FOSTER FINANCIAL INTEGRATIONTARGET2, the second generation of the 
Eurosystem™s large-value payment system, 
is the Þ rst market infrastructure to be completely 
integrated and harmonised at the European 
level. The Eurosystem has continued to make 
enhancements to TARGET2 and implemented 
a new release of the system in November 2010 
(see Section 2.1 of Chapter 2). T2S will have an important impact on the harmonisation and integration of the post-
trading environment in Europe. T2S will remove 
many of the ﬁGiovannini barriersﬂ 28 to cross-border clearing and settlement by, among other 
things: i) providing a single IT platform with a 
common interface and a single messaging 
protocol, ii) introducing a harmonised timetable 
for all connected markets, and iii) extending a 
single harmonised settlement model comprising 
delivery versus payment in central bank money 
to all national and cross-border transactions. 
In 2010 several sub-groups of the T2S Advisory 
Group comprising Eurosystem and industry 
experts continued to work on the development 
and implementation of standards and market 
practices for the harmonisation of instructions 
and processes in the context of T2S. As work on 
implementing T2S has progressed, new areas 
have regularly been identiÞ ed in which 
harmonisation is required, and these have either 
been tackled directly within the scope of the 
project or referred to CESAME II or its 
successor, the EGMI (see Section 2.2 of 
Chapter 2), or to other relevant bodies.Finally, in the area of collateral management, work continued in 2010 on the establishment 
of a single platform, Collateral Central Bank 
Management (CCBM2), for euro area NCBs 
with a view to consolidating and increasing 
the efÞ ciency of the Eurosystem™s internal 
systems and enhancing counterparties™ liquidity 
management and collateral management 
(see Section 2.3 of Chapter 2). The ﬁGiovannini barriersﬂ are a number of barriers hindering the 28 integration of the EU clearing and settlement infrastructure as identiÞ ed by the Giovannini Group, a group of 
Þ nancial market 
experts advising the European Commission. The speciÞ c barriers 
identiÞ ed can be found in two reports by the Giovannini Group: 
Cross-border Clearing and Settlement Arrangements in the 
European Union, November 2001, and Second Report on EU 
Clearing and Settlement Arrangements, April 2003. See also the website of the European Commission (http://ec.europa.eu). 150ECBAnnual Report
20104 OVERSIGHT OF PAYMENT SYSTEMS 
AND MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE 
Payment and securities clearing and settlement systems are fundamental infrastructures that 
are necessary for the proper functioning of 
market economies. They are indispensable 
for the efÞ cient ß ow of payments for goods, 
services and Þ nancial assets, and their smooth 
functioning is crucial for the implementation 
of a central bank™s monetary policy and for 
maintaining the stability of and conÞ dence in the 
currency, the Þ nancial system and the economy 
in general. Promoting the smooth operation of 
payment systems is a key task of the Eurosystem. 
For the performance of this task, the Eurosystem 
applies three approaches: it takes on an 
operational role, conducts oversight activities 
and acts as a catalyst.Through its oversight function, the Eurosystem aims to ensure the safety and efÞ ciency of 
payment and securities settlement systems, 
central counterparties processing the euro 
and payment instruments, by monitoring 
and assessing them and, where necessary, 
inducing change.In September 2010 the ECB published a book entitled ﬁThe payment system Œ payments, 
securities and derivatives and the role of the 
Eurosystemﬂ which gives a comprehensive 
overview of key concepts in market 
infrastructure, the euro area landscape and the 
role of the Eurosystem, including, inter alia, 
its oversight function. 4.1 LARGE-VALUE PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE PROVIDERSLarge-value payment systems form the backbone 
of the euro area market infrastructure and play 
an important role for the stability and efÞ ciency of the Þ nancial sector and the overall economy. 
The Eurosystem applies a well-deÞ ned oversight policy framework to all large-value 
payment systems that settle euro-denominated 
transactions Œ both its own systems and those 
that are privately operated. This framework 
is based on the internationally accepted Core 
Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems (CPSIPS), deÞ ned by the Committee 
on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) 
and adopted by the Governing Council in 2001. 
The CPSIPS are complemented by the Business 
Continuity Oversight Expectations (BCOE) 
for systemically important payment systems 
which the Governing Council adopted in 2006, 
giving the industry a deadline of June 2009 for 
implementation. The overall operational performance and provision of services of the key payment 
systems settling euro-denominated transactions 
(TARGET2, EURO1 and the Continuous Linked 
Settlement (CLS) system) and infrastructure 
service providers (such as SWIFT) were stable 
and resilient in 2010. TARGET2 
In 2010 the Eurosystem™s TARGET2 overseers 
focused on the aspects of operational risk which, 

according to the Risk-Based Prioritisation
Tool, 29 most warranted oversight attention. Therefore, one of the main oversight activities 
was the Þ nalisation of the assessment against 
the BCOE, which conÞ rmed that the business 
continuity framework of TARGET2 is generally 

well-established and ensures that a sufÞ ciently high and consistent level of resilience is 
achieved, although improvements to some 
areas of the framework were recommended. 
The overseers also discussed with the operator 
the follow-up to the comprehensive assessment 
carried out in 2009 and, in particular, 
the recommendation related to the business 
continuity framework. Moreover, in the context 
of regular oversight activities, the methodology 
for incident monitoring was revised. In addition, a new TARGET2 software release went live on 22 November 2010. Prior to 
its launch, the overseers assessed the new 
functionalities and, in particular, the provision 
of internet access to TARGET2, against the 
applicable CPSIPS. The overseers concluded 
that, overall, the new release will not adversely The Risk-Based Prioritisation Tool allows overseers to 29 concentrate on the components and areas that pose the highest risks. The tool has been applied to TARGET2 since 2009.151ECBAnnual Report
2010affect the compliance of TARGET2 with the CPSIPS, and several of the changes eliminate 
certain weaknesses of the system and will result 
in better services for TARGET2 customers. The TARGET2 Simulator, an analytical tool based on payment data, was gradually rolled 
out to the Eurosystem central banks as of 
1 July 2010. Once Þ ne-tuned, the tool will 
enable overseers, in particular, to closely 
replicate and stress-test the settlement process 
of TARGET2, using a pan-European dataset of 
TARGET2 activity, including all transactions, 
liquidity information and participant 
information. EURO1 
EURO1 is a large-value payment system 
for cross-border and domestic transactions 
in euro between banks operating in the EU. 
It is operated by the EBA Clearing Company, 
which was set up by the Euro Banking 
Association. EURO1 works on a multilateral 
net basis. The end-of-day positions of EURO1 
participants are ultimately settled in central bank 
money via the TARGET2 system, with the ECB 
acting as the settlement agent.Three main oversight activities relating to EURO1 were performed in 2010. First, the 
assessment of the system™s compliance with 
the BCOE was completed. As a result of this 
assessment, a few minor recommendations on 
EURO1 were communicated to the EBA 
Clearing Company for action, in order to 
achieve full compliance with the BCOE. 
Second, the ECB, in close cooperation with the 
Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banco de España, 
the Banque de France, the Banca d™Italia and 
De Nederlandsche Bank, launched the process 
for a full assessment of EURO1 against the 
CPSIPS. Finally, the ECB, together with the 
Banca d™Italia, assessed one major change that 
was made to EURO1 in 2010. This comprised 
the migration of its end-of-day settlement 
process from the FIN-based Participant Interface 
to the XML-based Ancillary System Interface 
(ASI) in TARGET2. The oversight assessment 
concluded that this migration will not adversely affect the compliance of EURO1 with the 
CPSIPS. Since 7 June 2010 EURO1 has been 
successfully settling its daily activities via the 
ASI in TARGET2. Overall, the EURO1 system 
operated smoothly throughout 2010. CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM 
The Continuous Linked Settlement system was 
launched in September 2002 and is operated 
by CLS Bank International (CLS Bank). 
The system provides a multi-currency service for 
the synchronous Œ i.e. payment-versus-payment 
(PvP) Œ settlement of payment instructions 
relating to foreign exchange transactions. 
Through its PvP mechanism, CLS virtually 
eliminates the principal risk associated with the 
settlement of foreign exchange transactions. 
CLS currently settles in 17 of the world™s 
most traded currencies, including the euro, 
the US dollar, the Japanese yen, the pound 
sterling and the Swiss franc.Given that CLS Bank is established in the United States, the Federal Reserve System accepts 
primary oversight responsibility for CLS under 
a cooperative oversight arrangement involving 
the G10 central banks and the central banks of 
issue of currencies settled by CLS. The ECB, 
in close cooperation with the euro area NCBs, 
is part of this cooperative oversight arrangement 
and has primary oversight responsibility for 
settlement in euro by CLS.In 2010 CLS cooperative oversight activities focused mainly on the enhancement of CLS™ 
operational capacity (in response to the peaks 
reached in May 2010 in terms of the number of 
daily transactions) and the monitoring of new 
business developments and initiatives by CLS.SWIFT 
SWIFT is important from a Þ nancial stability 
perspective, as it provides secure messaging 

services to the Þ nancial community in more 
than 210 countries around the world. SWIFT 

is a limited liability cooperative company 

which is established in Belgium. Through its 

participation in the G10 cooperative oversight 

of SWIFT, the ECB contributes to various 
152ECBAnnual Report
2010oversight activities carried out by the cooperative 
oversight group, with the Nationale Bank 

van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique 

being the overseer with primary oversight 

responsibility. In 2010 the group™s activities 

focused on the implementation of the Distributed 

Architecture programme aimed at redesigning 

SWIFT™s technical architecture, mainly through 

the implementation of two messaging zones 

(European and transatlantic), the construction 

of an additional operations centre in Europe 

and the establishment of a new command and 

control centre in Asia. Other major activities 

performed in 2010 included reviewing the 

operational performance and availability of 

SWIFT™s services, monitoring new projects 

that could potentially have an impact on the 

conÞ dentiality, integrity and availability of 
SWIFT™s critical services and reviewing the 

possible impact on the resilience and availability 

of messaging services of a cost optimisation 

programme launched by SWIFT. The level of 

availability of the SWIFTNet FIN network in 

2010 was 99.99%.4.2 RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS 
AND INSTRUMENTSThe Eurosystem also has oversight responsibility 
for retail payment systems and payment 
instruments.STEP2 is a retail payment system for cross-border payments operated by the EBA Clearing 
Company, for which the ECB has primary 
oversight responsibility. The ECB continued to 
monitor STEP2 services in 2010, ensuring their 
availability and smooth functioning. One major 
development that took place in 2010 was the 
deployment of a new multi-cycle functionality 
for the SEPA credit transfer service that enables 
STEP2 banks to exchange and settle SEPA 
credit transfers several times a day.In 2010 the Eurosystem made further progress 
with the individual oversight assessments of 

card payment schemes operating in the euro 

area against its oversight standards for such 
schemes, which were adopted in January 2008. 

Following a peer review process, a report 

on the overall results of the assessments is 

expected to be published in 2011.The Eurosystem has published the Þ nal version 
of the oversight frameworks for direct debit 
and credit transfer schemes and will apply 

these frameworks to the SEPA credit transfer 

scheme and the SEPA direct debit scheme. 

Individual NCBs may also elect to apply 

these standards for the oversight of national 

(non-SEPA) payment instruments, if they deem 

it appropriate.4.3 SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES CLEARING 
AND SETTLEMENTThe Eurosystem has a strong interest in the 

smooth functioning of securities clearing and 

settlement systems because failures in the 

clearing, settlement and custody of securities used 

as collateral for Eurosystem operations could 

jeopardise the implementation of monetary policy, 

the smooth functioning of payment systems and 

the maintenance of Þ nancial stability. 
MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES FOR OTC DERIVATIVESIn response to the G20 commitments announced 
at the Pittsburgh and Toronto summits to ensure 
effective progress towards electronic trading 
and the use of central counterparties (CCPs) 
for standardised over-the-counter (OTC) 
derivatives, as well as the reporting of all OTC 
derivatives contracts to trade repositories, 
extensive follow-up work was conducted 
throughout 2010. This included legislative 
initiatives in major jurisdictions Œ including, 
notably, the EU and the United States Œ aiming 
to establish mandatory obligations for the 
central clearing of all eligible OTC derivatives, 
the effective reporting of all contracts to 
trade repositories and the establishment 
of requirements to ensure the safety and 
soundness of OTC derivatives infrastructures. 
In the EU, where the common framework 
for CCPs had previously been based on the 
non-binding recommendations of the ESCB 153ECBAnnual Report
2010and the Committee of European Securities Regulators, legislative efforts regarding OTC 
derivatives infrastructures were complemented 
by proposals for a broader set of common 
rules for EU CCPs applicable to all types of 
Þ nancial product. The European Commission 
issued a proposal for a regulation on OTC 
derivatives, CCPs and trade repositories on 
15 September 2010. The ECB was closely 
involved in the development of this legislative 
proposal. A Eurosystem contribution to a 
Commission consultation on this matter was 
issued in July 2010. In order to support the convergence of legislative 
approaches across jurisdictions, the international 

standard-setting bodies have worked intensively 

to develop common guidance for OTC derivatives 

infrastructures. In May 2010 the CPSS and 

the International Organization of Securities 

Commissions (IOSCO) issued two documents for 

public consultation: ﬁGuidance on the application 

of the 2004 CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations 

for Central Counterparties to OTC derivatives 

CCPsﬂ and ﬁConsiderations for trade repositories 

in OTC derivatives marketsﬂ. The results of this 

work, which was co-chaired by the ECB, will 

be incorporated in the CPSS-IOSCO general 

review of the international standards for Þ nancial 
market infrastructures, and a draft of the revised 

standards is expected to be issued for consultation 

in early 2011. Given the global nature of OTC 

derivatives markets and the consequent need 

to preclude any possible scope for regulatory 

arbitrage, it will be critical to ensure that all 

national and regional legislation is implemented 

in such a way as to ensure close congruence with 

the CPSS-IOSCO standards.To the same end, the Financial Stability Board has developed proposals to ensure that 
authorities take a common approach to the 
implementation of the G20 recommendations 
to promote standardisation, central clearing, 
organised platform trading and the reporting of 
OTC derivatives contracts to trade repositories. 
The ECB participated in the FSB working group 
that developed these proposals, which were 
issued on 25 October 2010.TARGET2-SECURITIES 
TARGET2-Securities aims to provide a single, 
borderless pool of securities and a core, neutral 
settlement process. More detailed information regarding the design 
and the operational and legal framework of T2S 

was published in the course of 2010, and the 

Eurosystem held workshops with participants 

from central banks and supervisors to explore 

the criticality of T2S for payment infrastructures 

and central securities depositories (CSDs) that 

will use T2S services. Moreover, since T2S will 

offer cross-border services to both euro area and 

non-euro area CSDs and payment infrastructures, 

a large number of supervisors, overseers and 

central banks of issue of the currencies eligible to 

be settled in T2S will have an interest in receiving 

T2S data so that they can perform their statutory 

duties. So far, all competent authorities have 

supported the idea of establishing a cooperative 

framework for the oversight and supervision of 

T2S services. The cooperative framework under 

discussion would not touch upon the statutory 

powers of individual authorities over national 

systems, or upon the enforcement of such powers. 

T2S stakeholders will be informed as soon as the 

details of the cooperative framework have been 

agreed. A preliminary review of the T2S design 

was launched during the development phase by 

all the authorities involved.4.4 OTHER ACTIVITIES
In September 2010 the ECB published a report 
that summarises the results of a comprehensive 
assessment of the implementation of the BCOE 
by systemically important payment systems 
operating in euro area countries. In addition 
to TARGET2 and EURO1, the assessment 
covered systemically important retail payment 
systems. The results conÞ rmed that the 
business continuity and crisis communication 
arrangements of the assessed systems are 
maintained at a high standard by the system 
operators. Recommendations were issued to 
address a number of identiÞ ed de
Þ ciencies which do not pose a signiÞ cant risk.
The Grossmarkthalle is to house a visitors™ centre, staff restaurant, cafeteria and conference rooms. These areas will be integrated into the former market hall as a separate house-in-house system, necessitating a new and stronger structural 
framework. The original hall ß oor and its substructures were therefore removed in 2010.
CHAPTER 5EUROPEAN ISSUES156ECBAnnual Report
2010In 2010 the ECB continued its regular contacts with European institutions and fora, 
in particular with the European Parliament, 
the Eurogroup, the ECOFIN Council and the 
European Commission. The President of the 
ECB participated on a regular basis in meetings 
of the Eurogroup, as well as in ECOFIN Council 
meetings when matters relating to the objectives 
and tasks of the ESCB were discussed. In 
addition, the President of the ECB was invited 
to attend meetings of the European Council, as 
well as informal meetings at the level of Heads 
of State or Government, when issues related to 
the EU™s policy response to the economic and 
Þ nancial crisis were addressed. The President 
of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner for 
Economic and Monetary Affairs attended 
meetings of the Governing Council when they 
deemed it appropriate. EU POLICY RESPONSE TO THE FINANCIAL CRISISThe economic and Þ nancial crisis entered a new 
stage in early 2010 as Þ scal imbalances in 
certain euro area countries began to be reß ected in increasing tensions in sovereign debt markets. 
In particular, the rise in Greek sovereign debt 
yields created a risk of negative spillover effects 
that threatened to endanger the wider stability of 
the euro area. In response, on 2 May 2010 euro 
area countries agreed to activate, together with 
the IMF, a three-year Þ nancial support 
programme for Greece.1 The Þ nancial package 
made available •80 billion of bilateral loans 
from euro area countries and an IMF Stand-by 
Arrangement of up to •30 billion. The 
disbursement of funds was made conditional on 
the Greek authorities implementing the 
ambitious programme of Þ scal adjustment and 
comprehensive structural reforms negotiated by 
the European Commission, in liaison with the 
ECB, and the IMF.2 The ECB participated in the related review missions to Greece together with 
the European Commission and the IMF. In spite of these measures, tensions in Þ nancial markets continued to mount and escalated abruptly on 6 and 7 May 2010. In response, on 
7 May the Heads of State or Government of 
the euro area countries mandated the ECOFIN Council to decide on a stabilisation mechanism 
to preserve Þ nancial stability in Europe. 
On 9 May Member States agreed to establish 
two general facilities to provide Þ nancial support 
to EU countries experiencing severe economic 
or Þ nancial disturbances. Firstly, the ECOFIN 
Council adopted a Regulation setting up the 
European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism 
(EFSM), which allows the European Commission 
to raise up to •60 billion on behalf of the EU for 
providing Þ nancial assistance to EU Member 
States experiencing or threatened with serious 
difÞ culties caused by exceptional circumstances 
beyond their control. Secondly, the euro area 
Member States, on an intergovernmental basis, 
established the European Financial Stability 
Facility (EFSF). The EFSF was set up as a 
limited liability company authorised to issue 
debt securities, guaranteed up to a total of 
•440 billion by euro area countries on a pro rata 
basis, for lending to euro area countries. Loans 
from the EFSM and the EFSF are subject to 
strong conditionality and take place in the 
context of joint programmes with the IMF, which 
is expected to provide Þ nancing amounting 
to at least 50% of the EU/euro area contribution 
to each programme. On 21 November Ireland requested Þ nancial assistance from the IMF, the EU and the euro area countries. The ECB welcomed this request 
and concurred with the European Commission, 
the ECOFIN Council and the Eurogroup that 
providing assistance to Ireland was warranted to 
safeguard Þ nancial stability in the EU and in the 
euro area. The programme was concluded with 
the Irish authorities by the Commission and the 
IMF, in liaison with the ECB, and is subject to 
strong policy conditionality.On 16 and 17 December the European Council agreed to establish a European Stability 
Mechanism (ESM) to replace the EFSF 
and the EFSM from June 2013. The European Slovakia decided not to participate in the programme.1 See Section 6.3 of Chapter 2 for the outstanding amount of loans 2 to Greece.1 POLICY ISSUES
157ECBAnnual Report
2010Council called for euro area Þ nance ministers 
and the Commission to Þ nalise work on an 
intergovernmental arrangement to establish the ESM by March 2011. Non-euro area countries 
will, if they so wish, be involved in this work. 
They may decide to participate in operations 
conducted by the mechanism on an ad hoc basis. 
The European Council agreed on the text of a 
limited Treaty change to reß ect this decision, 
which will be adopted via the simpliÞ ed revision 
procedure. THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT 
On 16 February 2010 the ECOFIN Council took 
decisions within the framework of Þ scal surveillance regarding two euro area countries 
(Greece and Malta) and Þ ve non-euro area 
countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland 
and Romania). The Council extended the 
deadline for correcting the countries™ excessive 
deÞ cits from 2010 to 2011 in the case of Malta 
and from 2011 to 2012 for Lithuania and 
Romania, on account of a worse than expected 
deterioration of their economies. With regard to 
the two latter countries, the Council found on 
19 October that action taken was adequate and 
no additional steps in the excessive deÞ cit procedures (EDPs) were needed at that stage. 
Moreover, the Council assessed the action taken 
by Latvia, Hungary and Poland and decided that 
all three countries had up to that point acted in 
accordance with the EDP recommendations and 
that no additional steps were necessary. 
Regarding Greece, the Council issued a 
recommendation referring to the Broad 
Economic Policy Guidelines and made it public. 
Furthermore, it identiÞ ed a list of structural and Þ scal measures that Greece should adopt to 
correct its excessive deÞ cit by 2012. Greece was 
also invited to submit to the Council and the 
European Commission a report spelling out the 
measures in greater detail and providing the 
implementation timeline for achieving the 2010 
budgetary targets. Finally, Greece was required 
to report regularly and publicly on the measures 
taken.3 In May 2010, following considerable volatility 
in sovereign debt markets, Member States expressed their strong political commitment 
to Þ scal consolidation. In their statement of 
7 May, the Heads of State or Government of the 
euro area countries stressed their commitment 
to ensuring the stability, unity and integrity of 
the euro area and agreed to take all measures 
needed to meet their Þ scal targets in line with 
EDP recommendations. In the conclusions of 
the ECOFIN Council of 9 May, the Member 
States reafÞ rmed their strong commitment 
to accelerating Þ scal consolidation, where 
warranted. On 13 July the Council decided that excessive deÞ cits existed in two further euro area countries 
(Cyprus and Finland), as well as two non-euro 
area countries (Bulgaria and Denmark), and 
set deadlines (2011 for Bulgaria and Finland, 
2012 for Cyprus and 2013 for Denmark) for 
them to bring their general government deÞ cits below the reference value of 3% of GDP. The 
Council also assessed the action taken by 11 euro 
area countries (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, 
Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, 
Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia) and two 
non-euro area countries (the Czech Republic and 

the United Kingdom) subject to EDPs. It decided 

that all countries had up to that point acted in 
accordance with the EDP recommendations 
and that no additional steps in the EDPs were 
necessary at that stage. However, in the case 
of Ireland, the Council decided on 7 December 
to extend the deadline for the correction of 
the excessive deÞ cit by one year, to 2015, 
in view of unexpected adverse economic events 
with major unfavourable consequences for 
government Þ nances. Following these decisions, all Member States, 
except Estonia, Luxembourg and Sweden, were 
subject to EDPs, with deadlines for correction 
ranging from 2011 to 2015. The ECB welcomes the decisions regarding the new EDPs. As for the assessment of effective 
action, the structural adjustment in 2010 for On 10 May 2010 the Council extended the deadline for the 3 correction of the excessive deÞ cit in Greece to 2014.

2010some countries was somewhat smaller than required in the Council recommendations, while 
planned structural efforts also fell short of the 
recommendations. EUROPE 2020 STRATEGY 
On 17 June 2010 the European Council 
adopted ﬁEurope 2020: a strategy for jobs and 
smart, sustainable and inclusive growthﬂ. The 
strategy aims at raising potential growth and 
provides a coherent framework for Member 
States to implement structural reforms and 
mobilise policies and instruments at the 
EU level. It builds on the experiences of its 
predecessor, the Lisbon strategy, and addresses 
some of the weaknesses of the latter, notably 
by strengthening the role of the European 
Council and relying to a greater extent on 
EU-level policy initiatives, in particular the 
seven thematic ﬁß agship initiativesﬂ. To guide 
policy-making, the European Council has 
set a number of quantitative targets to be 
reached over the strategy™s horizon related to 
employment, R&D, climate change and energy, 
education and poverty. The Europe 2020 
strategy will be implemented as of early 2011. 
The ECB welcomes the changes in governance, 
in particular the stronger role of the European 
Council and the introduction of the ﬁEuropean 
semesterﬂ. During the European semester 
(the Þ rst six months of a year), the European 
Council will identify the main economic 
challenges and give strategic advice on policies, 
which Member States should take into account 
in their policies. Moreover, the ECB welcomes 
the introduction of new instruments such as the 
EU-level thematic pillar, which will focus on 
structural reforms in the Þ elds of innovation and 
R&D, energy and climate change, employment, 
education and social inclusion. The EU-level 
thematic pillar is supported by seven ß agship initiatives proposed by the Commission, which 
aim to support the reform efforts of Member 
States in these areas, and should reinforce the 
surveillance framework for Member States and 
thus be conducive to achieving the strategy™s 
goals. However, not all elements emphasised 
in earlier discussions, such as the need to better 
communicate the strategy, have been equally fully developed. As before, the success of the 
strategy will eventually hinge on the forceful 
implementation of ambitious reform strategies 
by Member States. RELAUNCHING THE SINGLE MARKETEfforts to complete the EU Single Market 
gained fresh impetus in 2010. Mario Monti, 
a former member of the European Commission 
who was, inter alia, responsible for the internal 
market, Þ nancial services and taxation, was 
invited by the President of the Commission, 
José Manuel Barroso, to prepare a report on 
the future of the Single Market, which he 
presented in May 2010. The report called on the 
EU Member States to overcome the apparent 
ﬁintegration fatigueﬂ and to drive economic 
integration forward at the EU level. To this end, 
the report puts forward a number of proposals, 
including completing the Single Market for 
services and enhancing citizens™ support for the 
Single Market. Following up on Mr Monti™s report, the Commission in October 2010 proposed a 
series of measures designed to relaunch the 
Single Market in the form of a ﬁSingle Market 
Actﬂ. In line with the Europe 2020 strategy, 
the ultimate goal of the Act is to stimulate 
growth and boost employment in the Member 
States. Following a public consultation, the 
Commission is expected to present legislative 
proposals in spring 2011. Among the proposed 
priorities are the creation of an EU patent, 
the access of small and medium-sized enterprises 
to capital, and the mutual recognition of 
professional qualiÞ cations. Moreover, there are 
several initiatives that aim at reducing barriers to 
electronic commerce and stimulating growth in 
the digital economy. Together with the ongoing 
implementation of the Services Directive in 
Member States, these initiatives are important 
steps towards deeper economic union and are 
fully supported by the ECB. 159ECBAnnual Report
20102 INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
In November 2010 the reform of the EU supervisory architecture was adopted by 
the European Parliament and the Council. 
Three new European Supervisory Authorities 
were created to strengthen micro-prudential 
supervision in the areas of banking 
(the European Banking Authority), insurance and 
occupational pensions (the European Insurance 
and Occupational Pensions Authority), as well as 
securities and markets (the European Securities 
and Markets Authority), while the newly 
created European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) 
will reinforce macro-prudential supervision. 
The ECB is entrusted with the speciÞ c task of 
ensuring the performance of the secretariat 
function for the ESRB. Further information on 
these issues can be found in Chapter 6. 160ECBAnnual Report
2010The economic and Þ nancial crisis and the 
turmoil in sovereign debt markets also 
highlighted the challenges to the economic 

governance of the euro area and the EU. 

In response, the European Council, at its 

meeting in March 2010, mandated its President, 

Herman Van Rompuy, to establish, in cooperation 

with the European Commission, a task force 

with representatives of the Member States, 

the rotating Council Presidency and the ECB to 

make proposals to strengthen the EU surveillance 

framework, in particular that for budgetary 

surveillance, and to improve the crisis resolution 

framework. In June 2010 the ECB presented a 

number of proposals to strengthen decisively 

governance and enforcement structures in the 

economic policy framework of the euro area. 
The task force report put forward proposals in Þ ve areas: greater 
Þ scal discipline, broadening 
economic surveillance to encompass 
macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness, 
deeper and broader coordination (notably 
during the European semester), a robust 
framework for crisis management, as well 
as stronger institutions for more effective 
economic governance. In October 2010 the 
European Council endorsed the task force report 
and called for a ﬁfast trackﬂ approach in the 
adoption of secondary legislation needed for the 
implementation of its recommendations. In this context, the Commission had already issued proposals in September 2010 relating to 
the reform of the Þ scal surveillance framework 
and to the establishment of a new surveillance 
mechanism to identify and correct emerging 
macroeconomic imbalances within the EU and the 
euro area. Moreover, on 28 and 29 October 2010, 
the Heads of State or Government agreed on 
the need for the Member States to establish 
a permanent crisis management mechanism. 
A limited Treaty change is foreseen. While the proposals put forward by the 
Commission represent a strengthening of the 

existing framework for Þ scal and macroeconomic 
surveillance in the EU, they do not go as far as 

the ﬁquantum leapﬂ called for by the Eurosystem 
towards strengthening the institutional 

foundations of EMU, and thus towards a deeper 

economic union that is commensurate with the 

degree of economic integration and 

interdependency already achieved through 

Monetary Union.4 The Eurosystem is particularly 
concerned about insufÞ cient automaticity in the 
implementation of procedures and calls for the 

introduction of political and reputational measures 

on top of Þ nancial sanctions to foster early 
compliance with the surveillance framework. 

Moreover, the quality and independence of 

surveillance should be assessed by an independent 

advisory body at EU level. In the Þ eld of 
Þ scal 
surveillance, the room for discretion left to the 

Council when assessing the existence of an 

excessive deÞ cit or when assessing the debt 
criterion should be reduced and consideration 

should be given to reversing the changes to the 

Stability and Growth Pact made in 2005, which 

allowed Member States greater leeway under the 

Pact. Moreover, requirements to achieve a 

country™s medium-term budgetary objective 

should be ambitious, in particular in Member 

States with high government debt. To facilitate 

compliance with their obligations under the Pact, 

euro area countries should swiftly implement 

strong national budgetary frameworks and 

improve the quality of their government statistics. 
With regard to the macroeconomic surveillance 

procedure, the new system of mutual surveillance 

would need to focus Þ rmly on euro area countries 
experiencing large current account deÞ cits, 
signiÞ cant losses of competitiveness and high 
levels of public and private debt, as well as 

other vulnerabilities that could threaten the 

stability of the euro area. The mutual surveillance 

should involve transparent and effective trigger 

mechanisms. It would be essential that the 

assessments of macroeconomic imbalances and 

recommendations for corrective action be given 

broad publicity at all stages of the surveillance 

process. An earlier and more gradual application 

of Þ nancial sanctions is needed to provide clear 
incentives for appropriate macroeconomic policies.Opinion of the European Central Bank of 16 February 2011 4 on economic governance reform in the European Union (CON/2011/13).3 IMPROVING ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE IN THE EU

20104  DEVELOPMENTS IN AND RELATIONS 
WITH EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES 
The ECB continued its policy dialogue with the central banks of the EU candidate countries 
through bilateral meetings and within the overall 
institutional framework for the enlargement 
process set up by the EU. Accession negotiations with Croatia began in October 2005. Negotiations on the 35 individual 
chapters of the acquis communautaire were started in June 2006 and continued to advance 
towards their Þ nal stage; by the end of 2010, 
28 of them had been provisionally closed. 
The ECB continued its fruitful relations with 
the Croatian National Bank, in the context of 
bilateral staff visits and an annual high-level 
policy dialogue. After opening accession negotiations with Turkey in October 2005, the European 
Commission started negotiations on the 
individual chapters of the acquis communautaire in June 2006, provisionally closing one chapter 
in the same month. In December 2006 the 
European Council decided, owing to the lack 
of progress in the extension of the customs 
union to the EU Member States, to suspend 
talks for 8 out of the 35 chapters and to put the 
provisional closing of any further chapters on 
hold. At the end of 2010 negotiations were open 
on 13 chapters and provisionally closed on one 
chapter. The ECB continued its long-standing 
high-level policy dialogue with the Central 
Bank of the Republic of Turkey. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate status in 2005. In 
October 2009 the European Commission 
recommended the opening of accession 
negotiations. However, the starting date for 
formal accession negotiations remains open, 
as the European Council has postponed its 
decision twice: in December 2009 and in 
June 2010. Staff-level contacts between the 
ECB and the National Bank of the Republic of 
Macedonia remain strong. Iceland became a candidate country on 17 June 2010. Accession negotiations were 
formally opened on 27 July 2010 and the process of screening Iceland™s legislation started in 
November 2010. As Iceland is already a member 
of the European Economic Area, its legislation 
is already in line with EU legislation in several 
important areas. On 17 December 2010 the European Council decided to grant Montenegro the status of 
candidate country, as recommended by the 
Commission in its opinion of 9 November 2010. 
A decision on the date for opening accession 
negotiations has not yet been made. The foundation plate for the double ofÞ ce tower is about three metres thick. Approximately 4,200 tonnes of steel were required

THE FUNCTIONING OF 
THE EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC 
RISK BOARD (ESRB)164ECBAnnual Report
20101 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND MANDATEThe European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) was established on the basis of Regulation (EU) 
No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and 
of the Council on European Union macro-
prudential oversight of the Þ nancial system and 
establishing a European Systemic Risk Board 1 and Council Regulation (EU) No 1096/2010 
conferring speciÞ c tasks upon the European 
Central Bank concerning the functioning of the 
European Systemic Risk Board.2 The two regulations entered into force on 16 December 
2010, the day after their publication in the 
OfÞ cial Journal of the European Union.
Together with the European Supervisory 
Authorities (ESAs), established on 
1 January 2011, the Joint Committee of the 
European Supervisory Authorities, and the 
national supervisory authorities composing the 
ESAs, the ESRB is part of the European System 
of Financial Supervision (ESFS), the purpose 
of which is to ensure the supervision of the EU 
Þ nancial system. 
Within the ESFS, the ESRB is an independent 
body responsible for the macro-prudential 
oversight of the EU Þ nancial system. 
It contributes to the prevention or mitigation 
of systemic risks to Þ nancial stability that 
arise from developments within the Þ nancial system so as to avoid periods of widespread 
Þ nancial distress.
The ESRB is in charge of collecting and 
analysing all the relevant and necessary 
information, identifying and prioritising 
systemic risks, and issuing warnings and 
recommendations for remedial action in 
response to the risks identiÞ ed. Warnings 
and recommendations may be either public 
or conÞ dential. They may be of a general or a 
speciÞ c nature, and may be addressed to the 
Union as a whole or to one or more Member 
States, or to one or more of the ESAs, or to one 
or more of the national supervisory authorities. 
Recommendations may also be addressed to the 
Commission in respect of the relevant Union 
legislation.The addressees of the recommendations must 
communicate to the ESRB and to the Council 
the actions undertaken in response to the 
recommendations and must provide adequate 
justiÞ cation for any inaction (ﬁact or explainﬂ). 
If the ESRB decides that its recommendation 
has not been followed, it shall, subject to 
strict rules of conÞ dentiality, inform the 
addressees, the Council and, where relevant, 
the ESA concerned. ESRB STRUCTURE 
For the Þ rst Þ ve years of its existence, the 
President of the ECB is the Chair of the ESRB. 
The Þ rst Vice-Chair of the ESRB is Mervyn King, 
the Governor of the Bank of England, also for a 
term of Þ ve years. The second Vice-Chair of the 
ESRB is the Chairperson of the Joint Committee 
of the European Supervisory Authorities, i.e. 
currently Andrea Enria as Chairperson of 
the European Banking Authority, according to 
the annual rotational scheme foreseen by the 
legislation. The structure of the ESRB comprises: the General Board, the Steering Committee, 
the Advisory ScientiÞ c Committee (ASC), 
the Advisory Technical Committee (ATC) 
and the Secretariat. The General Board is the ESRB™s sole decision-making body. It had its inaugural meeting on 
20 January 2011. The Steering Committee, 
which prepares in particular the meetings of 
the General Board, and the ATC, which brings 
together the same institutions as the General 
Board and will provide advice and assistance 
on issues relevant to the work of the ESRB, in 
particular the regular review of Þ nancial stability 
conditions in the EU, have also started their 
activities. For the other advisory committee, 
the ASC, which will anchor the analysis of 
academics in the policy activity of the ESRB, 
the selection of members took place during the Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and 1 of the Council of 24 November 2010, OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 1.Council Regulation (EU) No 1096/2010 of 17 November 2010, 2 OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 162.165ECBAnnual Report
2010Þ rst quarter of 2011 following the publication of 
a call for expressions of interest in the OfÞ cial Journal of the European Union. The Secretariat is responsible for the day-to-day business of 
the ESRB. It provides high-quality analytical, 
statistical, logistical and administrative support 
to the ESRB. It took over the staff and work 
undertaken by the ESRB Preparatory Secretariat, 
which was established in March 2010 (see also 
Sections 2 and 3 of this chapter). ACCOUNTABILITYVarious channels foreseen in Regulation 
No 1092/2010 ensure the accountability of the 
ESRB as an independent body. Each year the ESRB Chair is invited to a hearing in the European Parliament, marking 
the publication of the ESRB™s annual report to 
the European Parliament and the Council. In the 
event of widespread Þ nancial distress, additional 
hearings can be held. All these hearings are 
conducted separately from the monetary 
dialogue between the European Parliament and 
the President of the ECB.The ESRB Chair holds conÞ dential discussions 
on the ongoing activity of the ESRB at least twice a year (and more often, if needed) with 
the Chair and Vice-Chairs of the Economic and 
Monetary Affairs Committee of the European 
Parliament. An agreement is to be concluded 
between both entities on the detailed modalities 
regarding these meetings, with a view to 
ensuring full conÞ dentiality. The Chair and Vice-Chairs of the ESRB must 
explain to the European Parliament, during a 
public hearing, how they intend to discharge 
their duties under Regulation No 1092/2010. 
The Chair participated in a hearing on 
7 February 2011. The ESRB will also report in several forms to the Council on warnings and recommendations 
and their follow-up.166ECBAnnual Report
2010The ESRB Preparatory Secretariat was set up on 1 March 2010, on the basis of a decision 
taken by the Executive Board, to prepare for 
the establishment of the ESRB as foreseen in 
the broad agreement reached by the ECOFIN 
Council in December 2009. At the end of 2010 
it had 22 permanent staff (of which 11 were 
seconded from NCBs). Preparatory work was 
conducted along the lines of a master plan with 
three main strands of work dealing respectively 
with procedures, policies and infrastructures.Working relationships were established with future ESRB members, including more than 
Þ fty national supervisory authorities and the 
three Level 3 Committees, the forerunners of 
the ESAs. Numerous exchanges took place 
with the latter at the levels of staff, managers 
and chairpeople. The Preparatory Secretariat 
contributed to the setting-up and initial work of 
two joint High Level Groups established by the 
ECB and the three Level 3 Committees on the 
cooperation between the ESAs and the ESRB, 
dealing respectively with data exchange and a 
range of tasks relevant to systemic risk.In terms of procedures, work focused on the preparations for the establishment of 
the Þ ve ESRB institutional components. 
This included the preparation of drafts for: 
i) a decision of the General Board of the ESRB 
establishing the Rules of Procedure of the 
ESRB, ii) a mandate for the Advisory ScientiÞ c Committee and modalities for the selection of 
its members, and iii) a mandate for the Advisory 
Technical Committee and modalities for the 
appointment of its Chair. The Preparatory Secretariat also launched preliminary work on a strategy to implement 
the mandate of the ESRB for macro-prudential 
oversight of the EU Þ nancial system. 
This included the preparation of a consultation 
paper distributed among ESRB members, with 
a view to facilitating a common understanding 
of key concepts relating to the ESRB™s policy in 
the important start-up phase, the organisation Œ 

in cooperation with the Directorate General 
Research Œ of seminars with high-ranking academics, as well as the contribution to the 
ECB™s positions on draft EU regulation. A third stream of work consisted of establishing the infrastructures for the analytical, statistical, 
logistical and administrative support to the 
ESRB. For instance, DARWIN (the ECB™s 
document management system) was rolled out 
to all the ESRB member institutions to allow 
them to participate in ESRB tasks via secure 
internet connections for more than 1,000 users. 
In the same vein, the necessary steps were taken 
to ensure that the ESRB, as soon as it started to 
operate, had its own website 3 and that a logo could be approved at the Þ rst meeting of the 
General Board.http://www.esrb.europa.eu3 2 ACTIVITIES OF THE ESRB PREPARATORY 
SECRETARIAT167ECBAnnual Report
2010ﬁThe ECB shall ensure a Secretariat, and thereby provide analytical, statistical, logistical 
and administrative support to the ESRBﬂ.4 This support will, in particular, focus on 
the regular monitoring, identiÞ cation and 
assessment of EU-wide systemic risks, which 
includes the development and enhancement of 
analytical tools and methodologies, as well as 
statistical efforts to Þ ll data gaps identi
Þ ed for 
the purpose of conducting macro-prudential 
analysis. Work was carried out in all these 
domains in 2010 in order to prepare for the 
establishment of the ESRB.ANALYTICAL SUPPORTThe ECB provides its main analytical 
contribution to the ESRB in the form of regular 
monitoring and identiÞ cation of systemic 
risks faced by the EU Þ nancial system and 
impact assessments of those risks, should they 
materialise. In addition, at the request of the 
ESRB, speciÞ c studies on systemic risk and 
macro-prudential issues may be conducted by 
the ECB on an ad hoc basis. This regular contribution is based on ECB 
expertise, building on the organisation 

and infrastructure adopted for performing 

the ECB™s Þ nancial stability tasks. 
The information base to support the analysis 

also includes information collected through 

stepped-up market intelligence efforts, 

in particular to support the systemic risk 

identiÞ cation process. Regular systemic risk 
surveillance and assessment work also relies 

on and beneÞ ts from information shared 
among ESRB members, as well as feedback 

and advice provided by its substructures 

(e.g. the Steering Committee and the Advisory 

Technical Committee). The main elements of 

a conceptual framework for macro-prudential 

oversight and the process that underpins these 

core activities have been described in issues 

of the ECB™s Financial Stability Review. 5 Preparatory work has been carried out to 

establish procedures within the ECB to ensure 

a smooth production process.Systemic risk indicators and early warning 
systems are important analytical tools 
aiding the risk surveillance work of the ESRB. 
The systemic risk assessment is supported, 
in particular, by macro-stress-testing tools 
and the analysis of propagation channels to 
assess the potential severity of speciÞ c risks. 
To provide the ESRB with the best possible 
information, the analysis conducted and the 
tools employed need to be of the highest quality. 
As part of the preparatory work in this area, a 
detailed stocktaking of available analytical tools 
for macro-prudential analysis was undertaken 
both at the ECB and at the ESCB level. In 
addition, procedures were put in place to 
coordinate the regular review of available tools, 
with the objective of continuously improving 
the analytical framework, and to develop new 
analytical tools and Þ ll identi
Þ ed analytical gaps. 
The ESCB Macro-prudential Research Network 
plays a key role in this regard (see Box 10). The ECB stands ready to provide technical input to the preparation of ESRB recommendations 
on regulatory matters or legislative initiatives, at 
the request of the ESRB. This could include the 
regular monitoring of developments in 
regulatory or legislative areas of interest for the 
ESRB. Moreover, the ESRB may request from 
the ECB on an ad hoc basis the preparation of 
analyses or studies regarding regulatory or legal 
issues relevant to its mandate and tasks. 
Furthermore, the ECB may provide technical 
advice in relation to requests from EU 
institutions and national authorities to the ESRB 
to examine speciÞ c issues of relevance.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO THE ESRB168ECBAnnual Report
2010Box 10THE ESCB MACRO-PRUDENTIAL RESEARCH NETWORKThe new function of macro-prudential oversight assigned to central banks as a consequence of the Þ nancial crisis and the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board have created 
an urgent need for research in support of this new responsibility. To respond to this need, 
the General Council of the ECB approved in March 2010 the establishment of the ESCB 
Macro-prudential Research Network.The objective of this research network is to conduct research on conceptual frameworks, models and tools supporting macro-prudential oversight in the EU and to share research results. 
The network has a mandate covering three broad areas of research.The Þ rst area of research is macro-
Þ nancial models linking 
Þ nancial stability and the 
performance of the economy. Standard macroeconomic models usually do not capture relevant 
features of Þ nancial instability (such as bank defaults, illiquidity, feedback effects, multivariate 
extreme events and related non-linearities) and therefore fail to describe such situations, a 

shortcoming that became evident during the recent Þ nancial crisis. Moreover, most available 
stress-testing models do not beneÞ t from frameworks that capture both sides of the two-way 
interaction between Þ nancial instability and economic performance, an important input for a 
proper assessment of potential feedback effects in systemic risk. Therefore, the development 

of models including these features would Þ ll a gap in the research literature. Such models 
may also provide the basis for developing frameworks to identify and assess macro-prudential 

regulations and supervisory approaches, to analyse interactions between macro-prudential 

supervision/regulation and other macroeconomic stabilisation policies and to strengthen 

stress-testing models.The second area of research deals with early warning systems and systemic risk indicators. The 
network will contribute to the development of operational analytical tools that could be directly 

used by the new macro-prudential bodies (such as the ESRB). Therefore, the work in this area has a 

short to medium-term horizon. Emphasis will be placed, in particular, on early warning indicators, 

models and systems taking into account differences in Þ nancial structures across countries. The 
research carried out in this area may also contribute to related initiatives at the global level.The third area of research focuses on contagion risks. This work seeks a better understanding of cross-border contagion risks in Europe. These risks may have increased signiÞ cantly over the 
last decade due to Þ nancial integration. Other objectives are to improve understanding of the role 
of non-bank Þ nancial institutions in contagion and spillovers (e.g. related to certain activities of insurance companies or money market funds) and to better capture feedback effects amplifying 
the transmission of instability. These effects may have been underestimated by existing bank 
contagion simulation approaches.The main deliverables of the network are research papers, workshops and conferences (including interactions with researchers outside the ESCB). A Þ rst conference related to the activity of the 
network, which was organised by the ECB, the Centre for Economic Policy Research and the 
Center for Financial Studies, was hosted by the ECB in September 2010. The network will report 
its results in 2012.169ECBAnnual Report
2010STATISTICAL SUPPORTAccording to Article 2 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1096/2010 conferring speciÞ c tasks 
upon the European Central Bank concerning the 
functioning of the European Systemic Risk 
Board, the ECB provides statistical support to 
the ESRB in accordance with Article 5 of the 
Statute of the ESCB. 7In view of the long lead times required to 
deÞ ne, collect, compile and disseminate 
harmonised statistics of sufÞ cient quality to 
allow the performance of the tasks assigned 
to the ESRB, the ECB started preparatory 
work in 2010. In particular, the ECB carried 
out a stocktaking exercise comparing data 
requirements derived from Þ nancial stability 
analysis with data availability in order to identify 
the data gaps and Þ ll them wherever possible. 
Moreover, the ESCB developed a procedure 
for conducting ad hoc surveys in order to allow 
timely responses to speciÞ c data requirements 
of the ESRB.This preparatory work had two objectives: Þ rst, to allow policy-relevant indicators to be 
prepared for the ESRB decision-making body 
and its committees, as from their establishment 
in early 2011, based on a core set of available 
statistics; and, second, to work towards the development of a wide range of statistics 
necessary from a longer-term perspective. To ensure such statistical support to the ESRB, close collaboration between the ECB and the 
ESAs is key. This collaboration was already 
intensive with the three Level 3 Committees, 
the predecessors of the ESAs. Such close 
cooperation aims to ensure a smooth and 
effective two-way information ß ow between 
the ESAs and the ESRB, which is also efÞ cient in terms of the reporting burden, data content 
and IT infrastructure. One of the key factors for 
success is allowing an exchange of appropriate 
and reliable information for the performance 
of the respective tasks in accordance with 
European legislation and strictly respecting the 
data protection rules that safeguard conÞ dential information. Article 5 of the Statute of the ESCB provides the ECB, assisted 7 by the national central banks, with the legal powers to collect statistical information for the performance of the ESCB™s tasks.The foundations for the double ofÞ ce tower were laid during 2010. At the same time the underground staff car park was 
constructed adjacent to the basement of the double ofÞ ce tower.

20101 KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY SYSTEMSURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES 
IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMYGiven the high degree of economic and 
Þ nancial integration, developments in the global 
economic environment are critically important 
for the conduct of economic policy in the 
euro area. As a result, the Eurosystem closely 
monitors and analyses macroeconomic policies 
and underlying developments in countries 
outside the euro area. The ECB also plays an 
important role in the process of international 
multilateral surveillance of macroeconomic 
policies, which takes place mainly at the 
meetings of international organisations such as 
the BIS Œ where the President of the ECB is a 
member of the Board of Directors and chairs 
several important meetings, and ECB Executive 
Board members and staff are involved in many 
working groups. The ECB also participates in 
the relevant meetings of the IMF and the OECD, 
as well as fora such as the G20 and G7 Þ nance ministers and central bank governors.The international economic environment 
in 2010 was characterised by an economic 

recovery that differed substantially across 

regions, with emerging Asia and Latin America 

in the lead. The reduction of external imbalances 

in surplus and deÞ cit economies observed 
since the start of the Þ nancial crisis and over 
the course of 2009 slowed down in 2010 and 

in some cases these imbalances began to grow 

again, sparking concerns about prospective 

protectionist tensions. The US current account 

deÞ cit increased from 2.7% of GDP in 2009 
to 3.2% of GDP in 2010, while oil exporters™ 

current account surplus increased from 5.2% 

of GDP in 2009 to 6.6% of GDP in 2010. 

China™s current account surplus continued to 

decrease relative to GDP, falling from around 

6% in 2009 to about 4.7% in 2010. However, 

in absolute terms, the 2010 surplus was close 

to the levels prevailing before the collapse of 

Lehman Brothers in September 2008. As in 

recent years, the euro area™s current account 

was close to balance in 2010. Finally, Japan™s 

surplus was equal to 3.1% of GDP in 2010, 

slightly higher than in 2009, when it was 2.8% 

of GDP.The reduction of global imbalances since the start 

of the Þ nancial crisis has largely re
ß ected cyclical 
and temporary factors linked to the crisis Œ such 

as global deleveraging, a fall in private demand, 

lower oil prices and corrections in Þ nancial asset 
prices Œ rather than structural factors. In terms of 

structural factors that would help in substantially 

reducing global imbalances, deÞ cit countries 
should reduce Þ scal de
Þ cits and complete the 
structural reform agenda. Similarly, surplus 

economies could also contribute substantially by 

increasing domestic consumption, by developing 

more extensive social safety nets, by undertaking 

Þ nancial market reforms and by increasing 
exchange rate ß exibility.On various occasions in 2010 the Eurosystem 
stressed the risks and distortions that would 
ensue if global imbalances were to increase 
again, and expressed support for a rebalancing 
of global demand patterns. In particular, the 
Eurosystem repeatedly called for policies 
aimed at increasing private and public savings 
in countries with current account deÞ cits, the 
implementation of further structural reforms in 
mature economies with relatively low potential 
growth, and measures to increase domestic 
demand in emerging market economies, 
including improved capital allocation and a 
better appreciation of risks. In the context 
of the ongoing reß ections on improving the 
international Þ nancial architecture (see the 
following section), the Eurosystem underlined 
that such an improvement should not only foster 
Þ nancial market discipline, but also enhance 
macroeconomic policy discipline. A strengthened 
multilateral economic surveillance framework 
should be able to ensure that economic policies, 
especially in systemically important countries, 
are stability-oriented and sustainable. Support for 
a rebalancing of the global economy also came 
from the G20 framework for strong, sustainable 
and balanced growth.Finally, the euro area itself is subject to international policy surveillance exercises. 
In 2010 the IMF conducted its regular review 
of the monetary, Þ nancial and economic 
policies of the euro area, as a complement to its 173ECBAnnual Report
2010reviews of the individual euro area countries. The IMF™s Article IV consultations provided an 
opportunity for useful discussions between the 
IMF and the ECB, the President of the Eurogroup 
and the European Commission. Following 
these discussions, the IMF produced a report 
assessing the euro area policies.1 Similarly, the OECD conducted its regular economic survey 
of the euro area, with a view to identifying 
the main economic developments in the area and 
analysing policy options to address them.2In 2010, for the Þ rst time, two euro area countries 
received assistance from the IMF. Major central 
banks continued to provide liquidity assistance 
to central banks of other countries, with liquidity 
and credit support aimed at avoiding market 
instability (see Chapter 2).REFORMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL 

SET-UP 
Since the outbreak of the global Þ nancial crisis, the set-up and functioning of the international 
monetary system have been an issue for the 
international community. The G20 forum of 
systemically important advanced and emerging 
economies Œ where the ECB is part of the EU 
membership Œ continued to foster international 
cooperation, with the aim of strengthening and 
safeguarding the global economic recovery 
and promoting stronger, more sustainable and 
balanced growth. At their fourth summit in 
Toronto in June 2010, G20 leaders followed 
up on the commitments made at their previous 
meeting in Pittsburgh, where they had launched 
the framework for strong, sustainable and 
balanced growth. The aim of this framework 
is to help manage the transition from crisis 
response to a strong, sustainable and balanced 
pattern of global growth, as well as to address 
the global imbalances that contributed to the 
Þ nancial crisis. The framework foresees a 
process of mutual assessment of how national 
and regional policies and policy frameworks of 
G20 members Þ t together and whether they are 
consistent with the framework™s objective. At 
their Toronto summit, the leaders completed the 
Þ rst stage of this process and agreed on a number 
of concrete commitments, e.g. by advanced deÞ cit countries to take actions to boost national 
savings and by surplus economies to undertake 
reforms to reduce their reliance on external 
demand and focus more on domestic sources of 
growth. Emerging surplus economies committed 
to undertake reforms to strengthen social safety 
nets to help reduce precautionary savings and 
stimulate private spending and to enhance 
exchange rate ß exibility to re
ß ect underlying 
economic fundamentals. Furthermore, all G20 
members pledged to embark on structural 
reforms to stimulate economic growth. In the 
area of Þ nancial regulation, G20 members 
identiÞ ed a number of priority areas for further 
work (see Chapter 4). At their Þ fth summit in Seoul in November 2010, 
G20 leaders agreed on the Seoul Action Plan with concrete policy commitments to make progress 
towards meeting the objectives of the framework. 
Moreover, they endorsed the outcomes of 
a number of important work streams that had 
been reached in preparation for this summit, 
notably a reform of IMF quotas and governance, 
as well as key building blocks for transforming 
the Þ nancial system by addressing the root 
causes of the crisis (one of the building blocks 
is the work of the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision). Furthermore, G20 leaders showed 
awareness that the G20 also has to address issues 
concerning the large, non-represented group 
of developing and low-income countries. Following up on the commitment made by G20 leaders at their London summit in April 2009 to 
increase resources available to international 
Þ nancial institutions, the IMF™s Executive Board 
approved on 12 April 2010 a reform and 
expansion of the New Arrangements to Borrow 
(NAB).3 This reform will make the NAB more Euro area policies: 2010 Article IV consultation Œ staff report1 , IMF Country Report No 10/221, July 2010.OECD Economic Surveys: Euro Area 20102 , OECD, December 2010.
The NAB are credit arrangements between the IMF and a number 3 of IMF member countries that provide supplementary resources 
to the IMF, i.e. in addition to the Fund™s quota resources, in 
circumstances in which there is a need for supplemental resources 
ﬁto forestall or cope with an impairment of the international 
monetary systemﬂ.174ECBAnnual Report
2010ß exible, broaden the participation from 26 to 
39 countries, and increase the overall amount of these credit lines to the Fund from SDR 34 billion 

to SDR 367.5 billion. In the course of 2009 
and 2010, a number of advanced and emerging 
market economies pledged to enter into bilateral 
borrowing and note purchase agreements with 
the Fund amounting to SDR 196 billion. 
Most bilateral agreements will be gradually 
incorporated into the new NAB after it comes 
into effect. Agreement was also reached to considerably increase the Fund™s quota resources. The 
doubling of quotas, which will be accompanied 
by a rollback of the NAB, is meant to ensure that 
the Fund remains a quota-based institution. The 
quota increase will also help to achieve a further 
shift in quota shares from advanced countries 
to dynamic emerging and developing countries, 
in line with the objective to align quota shares 
with members™ relative weight and role in the 
global economy. A consensus was also reached 
on the Þ rst elements of a broader governance 
reform. In that context, the IMF™s Articles of 
Agreement will be amended to provide for 
an all-elected Executive Board. In addition, 
European advanced countries committed to 
give up two seats on the IMF™s Executive Board 
to foster the representation of emerging and 
developing countries.As part of the measures to support countries during the Þ nancial crisis, the IMF undertook a 
number of signiÞ cant changes to its lending 
toolkit. In this context, programme access and 
the duration of the Fund™s Flexible Credit Line 
(FCL) Œ a precautionary lending facility 
introduced in 2009 for top-performing countries 
with strong policy track records, which entails 
only ex ante conditionality Œ were modiÞ ed in 
August 2010.4 The August 2010 lending reform also saw the creation of a new Precautionary 
Credit Line (PCL). The PCL is designed for 
Fund members with sound policies which 
nonetheless do not meet the FCL™s high 
qualiÞ cation requirements, thus being available 
to a wider Fund membership.5 As part of the review of its mandate, the IMF 
deliberated further on modernising surveillance 
and strengthening its multilateral and Þ nancial dimensions. In a pilot project, Þ ve economies 
are to be examined for the external impact of 
their policies, in ﬁspillover reportsﬂ. The euro 
area is one of these Þ ve economies (along with 
China, Japan, the United Kingdom and the 
United States). Further progress was made in 
strengthening Þ nancial sector surveillance with 
the decision to make the stability assessments 
under the Financial Sector Assessment Programs 
a mandatory part of annual IMF country 
surveillance reports (Article IV reports) for 
countries with systemically important Þ nancial sectors. 25 such countries have been identiÞ ed, including nine in the euro area (Belgium, 
Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria). 
Also on the Þ nancial side, the Early Warning 
Exercise Œ an exercise in risk identiÞ cation, born of the crisis and involving collaboration 
between the IMF and the Financial Stability 
Board Œ has become a regular feature of the 
spring and annual IMF meetings.As a result of the changes, FCL arrangements can now be 4 approved for either one year, or two years with an interim review of qualiÞ cation after one year. Previously, arrangements were 
either for six months, or one year with an interim review after 
six months. The previously implicit cap on access of 1,000% of a 
member™s IMF quota has been removed, with access decisions to 
be based on individual country Þ nancing needs. The procedures 
leading up to the approval of the arrangement have also been 
modiÞ ed, with earlier IMF Executive Board involvement now 
envisaged to assess the contemplated level of access and its 
impact on the IMF™s liquidity position. The nine qualiÞ cation criteria used by both staff and the IMF Executive Board to 
assess the merits of a country™s application for the FCL remain 
unchanged, but a number of relevant indicators have been 
added to each category in order to provide further guidelines on 
compliance.
QualiÞ cation will be assessed in 
Þ ve broad areas, namely: 
5 i) the external position and market access, ii) Þ scal policy, 
iii) monetary policy, iv) Þ nancial sector soundness and 
supervision, and v) data adequacy. While requiring strong 
performance in most of these areas, the PCL allows access 
to precautionary resources to members that have moderate 
vulnerabilities in one or two of these areas. Other features of 
the PCL include streamlined ex post conditions (which may or 
may not include performance criteria), with progress in reducing 
vulnerabilities monitored through semi-annual programme 
reviews, and frontloaded access with up to 500% of quota made 
available on approval of the arrangement, and up to a total of 
1,000% of quota after 12 months.175ECBAnnual Report
2010The international Þ nancial community also 
continued to promote mechanisms for crisis prevention and orderly crisis resolution. In this 
context, further progress was made by sovereign 
debtors and their private creditors and investors 
in implementing the ﬁPrinciples for stable 
capital ß ows and fair debt restructuringﬂ, which had been endorsed by G20 Þ nance ministers 
and central bank governors in 2004. The aim 
of these principles, which are market-based and 
voluntary, is to provide guidelines regarding 
information-sharing, dialogue and close 
cooperation. In an effort to increase further the 
usefulness of these principles, agreement was 
reached by the relevant parties in autumn 2010 
on the beneÞ ts of broadening their applicability 
beyond emerging market sovereign debtors and 
their creditors. 176ECBAnnual Report
20102 COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 
THE EUAs in previous years, the Eurosystem organised seminars and workshops with non-EU central 
banks in order to foster policy dialogue. 
In this respect, the ECB also actively participated 
alongside the European Commission in the EU™s 
macroeconomic dialogue with key emerging 
market economies (e.g. Brazil, Egypt, India 
and Russia) and EU neighbouring countries. 
In addition, the technical assistance provided 
by the Eurosystem remained an important tool 
for strengthening the administrative capacity of 
central banks outside the EU, especially in the 
EU™s neighbouring regions, and for enhancing 
compliance with European and international 
standards.POLICY DIALOGUE AND SURVEILLANCE 

OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES 

IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMYThe Eurosystem and the Bank of Russia held their 
sixth high-level seminar on 3-5 February 2011 in 
Frankfurt, hosted by the ECB. The purpose of the 
seminar was to further strengthen the dialogue 
and enhance relations between the Eurosystem 
and the Bank of Russia. Seminar discussions 
focused on the Russian economy, on the role 
of money and credit in the conduct of monetary 
policy and on the new supervisory architecture 
in the EU and Russia. Moreover, the President of 
the ECB participated in the conference marking 
the 150th anniversary of the Bank of Russia 
in June 2010.The sixth high-level Eurosystem seminar with Mediterranean countries™ central banks Œ 
co-organised by the ECB and the Central Bank of 
Cyprus Œ took place on 27 and 28 October 2010 

in Pafos. Governors reviewed challenges for 
monetary policy in Mediterranean countries on 
the way to economic recovery and discussed the 
experience of Mediterranean countries under 
Þ xed exchange rate regimes, as well as the 
impact of the global Þ nancial turmoil on banking 
sectors and Þ nancial stability. 
The Eurosystem held a second high-level 
seminar with central banks and monetary 
agencies of the member states of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC),6 which wasco-organised by the ECB and the Banca d™Italia 
and held on 29 and 30 June 2010 in Rome. 
The seminar topics were economic and Þ nancial developments in the GCC countries and the euro 
area, lessons from the Þ nancial crisis for 
Þ nancial stability and banking supervision, and challenges 
in monetary and exchange rate policy in 
the GCC.The Þ fth high-level Eurosystem seminar with 
Latin American central banks took place on 10 December 2010 in Madrid and was 
co-organised by the ECB and the Banco de 
España. The seminar participants discussed the 
following topics: global rebalancing, Þ nancial ß ows and global macro-prudential risks, and 
global policy cooperation.The ECB continued to deepen its cooperation 
with the Chinese authorities. The President 

of the ECB, the President of the Eurogroup 

and the Commissioner for Economic and 

Monetary Affairs (the ﬁeuro area troikaﬂ) met 

the Chinese authorities for the third time on 

5 October 2010 in Brussels. The discussion 

focused mainly on exchange rate policies and 

other issues of global importance. The relationship 

with the People™s Bank of China (PBC) was 

further strengthened. In 2010 the ECB-PBC 

Working Group discussed a wide range of topics, 

such as the rebalancing of global growth, asset 

price bubbles and associated risks, Þ nancial sector 
reform and other international monetary issues. 

The ECB also established contacts with China™s 

main planning agency, the National Development 

and Reform Commission, and with the Chinese 

Academy of Social Sciences, which is one of the 

most inß uential think-tanks in the country.
Finally, the Þ fth high-level seminar of central 
banks in the East Asia-PaciÞ c region and the 
euro area, organised by the ECB and the Reserve 
Bank of Australia, was held in Sydney on 
9 and 10 February 2010. The purpose of the 
seminar was to review economic policies in 
the aftermath of the Þ nancial crisis, including 
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United 6 Arab Emirates.177ECBAnnual Report
2010exit strategies, the shape and structure of global growth, the challenges posed by cross-border 
banking and the prospect of strengthening 
macro-prudential supervision. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCEWith regard to technical assistance, the ECB 
continued to deepen its relations with the western 
Balkans and Turkey. On 19 January 2010 the 
European Commission and the ECB, also on 
behalf of 14 euro area NCBs,7 signed an agreement to implement a two-year technical 
assistance programme for EU candidates and 
potential candidates. The aim of the programme 
is to strengthen macro and micro-prudential 
supervision in the western Balkans and in 
Turkey. The programme is being implemented 
by the ECB together with the partner NCBs and 
in cooperation with international and European 
institutions such as the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision, the Committee of 
European Banking Supervisors, the Financial 
Stability Institute, the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank. During the Þ rst phase 
of the programme, the Eurosystem organised 
an intensive regional training programme on 
macro and micro-prudential supervision for 
some 150 core supervisors from the beneÞ ciary institutions.8 The programme will also support the implementation of speciÞ c national 
measures, which were deÞ ned in agreement with 
the IMF and the World Bank, partner NCBs 
and beneÞ ciaries. Furthermore, region-wide 
technical simulations on home-host cooperation 
are foreseen.On 1 April 2010 the ECB and seven euro area 
NCBs 9 began an 18-month programme of 
technical assistance with the Central Bank of 

Bosnia and Herzegovina. The programme, 

funded by the EU, supports the Central Bank of 

Bosnia and Herzegovina in implementing EU 

central banking standards and EU requirements in 

preparation for the potential accession of Bosnia 

and Herzegovina to the EU. The areas covered 

are statistics, economic analysis and research, 

Þ nancial stability, legal requirements arising 
from the acquis communautaire, information 
technology and coordination of EU integration. 
The ECB and 21 NCBs 10 also started supporting the National Bank of Serbia on 1 February 2011 
with an EU-funded programme. During its 
two-year duration, the programme aims at 
bringing central banking procedures and 
practices closer to EU standards in the areas of 
Þ nancial sector supervision, legal harmonisation, 
liberalisation of capital movements, foreign 
exchange reserve management, monetary and 
exchange rate operations, consumer protection 
for Þ nancial services, EU accession support, 
economic analysis and research, statistics, 
payment systems and Þ nancial stability. 
The technical cooperation programme with the 
Bank of Russia, funded by the EU, continued. 
The ECB, in partnership with eight euro area 
NCBs 11 and in cooperation with the Financial Supervisory Authority of Finland, provides 
technical assistance in the areas of banking 
supervision and internal audit. The aim is 
to support the gradual implementation of 
Basel II in Russia and to support the Bank of 
Russia™s internal audit services with training 
and information on Eurosystem internal audit 
practices. The programme is running as planned 
and will end on 31 March 2011.Cooperation with the Central Bank of Egypt continued throughout 2010 on an EU-funded 
programme aiming at strengthening banking 
supervision in Egypt to achieve compliance with 
the basic components of the Basel II framework. 
The programme involves experts from the ECB 
and seven NCBs of the ESCB.12The NCBs of Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, 7 Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.
The central banks and supervisory authorities of Croatia, the 8 former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Montenegro, Turkey, Serbia and Kosovo under 
UN Security Council resolution 1244.
The NCBs of Germany, Greece, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, 9 Austria and Slovenia.
The NCBs of Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, 10 Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Cyprus, Luxembourg, 
Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, 
Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and the United Kingdom.
The NCBs of Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, 11 the Netherlands, Austria and Finland.
The NCBs of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, 12 France, Italy and Romania.Construction work is ongoing in the eastern wing building of the Grossmarkthalle. The former market hall will form an integral part of the new ECB premises. To this end, construction and restoration works started in spring 2010.CHAPTER 8ACCOUNTABILITY180ECBAnnual Report
2010Central bank independence has established itself over the past few decades as an indispensable 
element of the monetary policy regimes of 
both mature and emerging economies. The 
decision to grant central banks independence 
is Þ rmly grounded in economic theory and 
empirical evidence, both of which show that 
such a set-up is conducive to maintaining price 
stability. At the same time, it is a founding 
principle of democratic societies that any 
independent institution bestowed with a public 
function must be accountable to citizens and 
their elected representatives. Accountability is 
therefore an important counterpart of central 
bank independence. The Treaty lays down precise reporting requirements for the ECB, which include the 
publication of a quarterly report, a weekly 
Þ nancial statement and an annual report. 
The ECB goes beyond these statutory 
obligations in its regular reporting. For instance, 
it publishes a Monthly Bulletin, rather than the 
required quarterly report, and holds monthly 
press conferences following the Þ rst Governing 
Council meeting of each month. The latter 
continue to be a prime opportunity for the 
ECB to explain in depth its assessment of the 
economic situation and the rationale behind its 
interest rate decisions. The ECB™s commitment 
to accountability and transparency is also 
illustrated by the many publications it released 
in 2010 and the numerous speeches delivered 
by the members of the Governing Council, 
which dealt with a broad variety of topics of 
relevance to the ECB™s tasks, ranging from the 
extraordinary measures taken by the ECB in 
May 2010 to the need for Þ scal consolidation 
and for the reform of economic governance. The European Parliament, as the institution which derives its legitimacy directly from the 
citizens of the EU, plays the most important 
institutional role in holding the ECB to account. 
Since its establishment, the ECB has maintained 
a close and fruitful dialogue with the European 
Parliament. The President of the ECB continued 
to report on the ECB™s monetary policy and 
its other tasks during his quarterly hearings before the European Parliament™s Committee 
on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). 
In line with the provisions of the Treaty, he also 
appeared before the plenary session of the 
Parliament in November 2010 to present the 
ECB™s Annual Report 2009. Other members of the ECB™s Executive Board also appeared before the European Parliament 
on a number of occasions. The Vice-President 
presented the ECB™s Annual Report 2009 to 
ECON before it was presented in the plenary 
session. Jürgen Stark held an exchange of 
views with the members of ECON and 
representatives of national parliaments on the 
subject of economic recovery and exit strategies. 
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi participated in a public 
hearing organised by ECON on economic 
governance. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell also 
appeared before ECON to inform its members 
about payment issues. In line with past practice, 
a delegation from ECON visited the ECB 
on 13 December 2010, in order to exchange 
views with the members of the Executive 
Board. In addition, the ECB hosted a visit 
by the Special Committee on the Financial, 
Economic and Social Crisis and by the 
Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. 
Members of these two committees thus had 
the opportunity to discuss with Executive 
Board members a wide range of issues, such as 
recent economic and Þ scal developments, 
global imbalances and labour market reforms. Finally, ECB staff presented the ECB™s 2010 Structural Issues Report on energy markets and 
the euro area macroeconomy to European and 
national parliamentarians. 1 ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT181ECBAnnual Report
2010During the various exchanges of views between the members of the European Parliament and 
ECB representatives, a wide range of issues 
were addressed. Beyond macroeconomic 
developments and the ECB™s monetary policy, 
the main issues discussed concerned EU and 
euro area economic governance and legislation 
on Þ nancial regulation and supervision.
REFORM OF EU AND EURO AREA 

ECONOMIC GOVERNANCEThe reform of the economic governance 
framework in the EU (see Chapter 5) featured 
prominently in the discussions between the 
ECB and the European Parliament. In the 
own-initiative reports prepared by ECON 
and the Special Committee on the Financial, 
Economic and Social Crisis, the European 
Parliament put forward recommendations 
for measures and initiatives to be taken to 
enhance the existing rules and procedures. 
Among other things, it urged that the provisions 
of the Stability and Growth Pact be strengthened, 
and proposed the establishment of an effective 
incentive and penalty mechanism. The European 
Parliament debated the package of six legislative 
proposals put forward by the Commission 
on 29 September 2010 and, together with the 
Council, entered into the relevant legislative 
procedures in order to adopt them. During his appearances before the European Parliament, the President of the ECB called for 
a quantum leap forward in the strengthening 
of the economic governance of the EU, and in 
particular of the euro area. He expressed his 
full conÞ dence in the European Parliament™s 
ability and willingness to pursue a resolutely 
European approach to this matter. In addition, 
ECB representatives provided expert advice to 
the European Parliament on speciÞ c aspects of 
the economic governance package. EU FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMThe European Parliament and the ECB 
continued their intensive dialogue on matters 
concerning Þ nancial supervision and regulation. 
The European Parliament and the Council 
formally adopted the four legislative acts establishing the European Systemic Risk Board 
and the European Supervisory Authorities 
(see Chapter 4).1 During his appearances before the European 
Parliament, the President of the ECB welcomed 
the instrumental role played by the European 
Parliament in the pursuit of an ambitious 
Þ nancial supervisory reform with a true 
European perspective. He also stressed the 
importance of maintaining political momentum 
in order to further implement the Þ nancial regulatory agenda.As regards other Þ nancial sector legislation, 
the European Parliament™s activity Œ and its discussions with ECB representatives Œ focused 
on the Alternative Investment Fund Managers 
Directive and the third revision of the Capital 
Requirements Directive, as well as on legislation 
on Þ nancial conglomerates, deposit guarantee 
schemes, credit rating agencies, short selling, 
and over-the-counter derivatives and market 
infrastructures. On all these issues, the President 
of the ECB stressed the importance of 
achieving a level playing Þ eld and of avoiding 
regulatory arbitrage. The ECB™s legal advice 
on EU legislative proposals within its Þ eld of competence in the form of ECB opinions 
(see Section 6.2 of Chapter 2) also served as a 
source of technical advice to members of the 
European Parliament.In addition, the EU Council adopted a Regulation 1 (No 1096/2010) conferring speciÞ c tasks upon the European 
Central Bank concerning the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board. 2 SELECTED TOPICS RAISED AT MEETINGS 
WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTThe entrance building will create a functional and visual link between the Grossmarkthalle and the double ofÞ ce tower. It will 
intersect with the Grossmarkthalle to form a clearly identiÞ able entrance from the north side of the site on Sonnemannstrasse. 
It will also house the press centre.In preparation for the construction of the entrance building, three segments of the Grossmarkthalle™s roof were removed in August 2010, with the agreement of the historic preservation authorities. The three concrete shells that were removed were 
those that were damaged during the Second World War air raids and subsequently reconstructed in the 1950s.CHAPTER 9EXTERNAL 
COMMUNICATION184ECBAnnual Report
20101 COMMUNICATION POLICY 
External communication at the ECB aims to enhance the public™s understanding of the 
ECB™s policies and decisions and, as such, is an 
integral part of the ECB™s monetary policy and 
its other tasks. Two key elements Œ openness and 
transparency Œ guide the ECB™s communication 
activities. Both contribute to the effectiveness, 
efÞ ciency and credibility of the ECB™s monetary 
policy and its other statutory tasks. They also 
support the ECB™s efforts to give a full account 
of its actions, as explained in more detail in 
Chapter 8. The ECB™s concept of real-time, regular and comprehensive explanations of its monetary 
policy assessment and decisions, which was 
introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely 
open and transparent approach to central 
bank communication. Monetary policy 
decisions are explained at a press conference 
immediately after the Governing Council has 
taken them. The President delivers a detailed 
introductory statement at the press conference, 
explaining the Governing Council™s decisions. 
The President and Vice-President are then 
at the media™s disposal to answer questions. 
Since December 2004 decisions taken by the 
Governing Council other than those setting 
interest rates have also been published every 
month on the websites of the Eurosystem 
central banks. ECB legal acts are made available in all the ofÞ cial languages of the EU, as are the 
Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions, 
the decisions taken by the Governing Council in 
addition to decisions setting interest rates, and 
the consolidated Þ nancial statements of the 
Eurosystem. 1 The ECB™s Annual Report is also made available in full in all ofÞ cial EU 
languages. 2 The Convergence Report and the quarterly issues of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin 
are made available either in full or in summary 
form in all ofÞ cial EU languages.
 3 For the purposes of public accountability and 
transparency, the ECB publishes other 
documentation in addition to the statutory 
publications in some or all ofÞ cial languages, 
in particular press releases announcing 
staff macroeconomic projections, policy 

positions and information of relevance to the 

general public. The preparation, publication 

and distribution of the national language 

versions of the ECB™s key publications 

are undertaken in close collaboration with 

the NCBs.With the exception of Irish, for which a derogation is in effect 1 at the EU level.With the exception of Irish (by EU derogation) and Maltese 2 (by agreement with the Central Bank of Malta, following the 
lifting of the temporary EU derogation in May 2007).
See footnote 2.3 185ECBAnnual Report
2010The ECB addresses a variety of audiences Œ Þ nancial experts, the media, 
governments, parliaments and the general 
public Œ with varying levels of knowledge 
regarding Þ nance and economics. Its mandate 
and decisions are therefore explained through 
a range of communication tools and activities 
which are constantly being reÞ ned in order to 
make them as effective as possible, taking into 
account the different audiences and the relevant 
communication environments and needs. In 2010 the ECB™s communication activities focused, in particular, on explaining the events 
and consequences of the global Þ nancial and 
economic crisis and the measures taken by the 
ECB and the Eurosystem. The vast majority 
of all public speeches delivered by members 
of the Executive Board were related to this 
issue. This topic also dominated the questions 
and requests for information received from 
the press, the public and visitors to the ECB. 
The plans for setting up the European Systemic 
Risk Board and deÞ ning its objectives and tasks, 
including the ECB™s speciÞ c role in ensuring the 
performance of the secretariat function for the 
new body, also featured regularly in the ECB™s 
communication activities. The ECB publishes a number of regular and periodic studies and reports. These include: 
the Annual Report, which presents a review of 
the ECB™s activities in the previous year and 
thus contributes to the ECB™s accountability; 
the Monthly Bulletin, which provides regular 
updates on the ECB™s assessment of economic 
and monetary developments and detailed 
information underlying its decisions; and the 
Financial Stability Review, which assesses the 
stability of the euro area Þ nancial system with 
regard to its ability to absorb adverse shocks. 
The ECB also provides a wide range of statistical 
data, primarily by means of the Statistical Data 
Warehouse and interactive charts on the ECB™s 
website, but also in hard copy in the monthly 
editions of the Statistics Pocket Book.All members of the ECB™s Governing 
Council contribute directly to enhancing public knowledge and understanding of the 
Eurosystem™s tasks and policies by giving 
testimonies before the European Parliament and 
national parliaments, delivering public speeches 
and granting interviews to the media. In 2010 
the President of the ECB and other members 
of the Executive Board appeared before the 
European Parliament a total of eight times 
(for more details, see Chapter 8). Over the course 
of the year Board members delivered around 200 speeches to a variety of audiences and granted 
260 interviews to the media. They also had 
many articles published in journals, magazines 
and newspapers. The euro area NCBs play an important 
role in ensuring the dissemination, at the 
national level, of Eurosystem information and 
messages to the general public and interested 
parties. They address a variety of national and 
regional audiences in their own languages 
and environments. In 2010 the ECB organised 15 seminars for journalists aimed at enhancing the knowledge 
and understanding of the national and 
international media as regards the ECB™s 
mandate, tasks and activities. It organised 
seminars on its own and in cooperation with the 
NCBs, the European Commission, the European 
Journalism Centre and other public authorities 
and foundations. The ECB welcomed approximately 13,000 visitors 

to its premises in Frankfurt in 2010. Visitors 

received Þ rst-hand information in the form 
of presentations given by ECB experts and 

managers.All documents published by the ECB and other 
information about its various activities are 
available on the ECB™s website. In 2010 the 
website received 29 million visits (16% more 
than in the previous year), 231 million pages 
were viewed and 68 million documents were 
downloaded. In December 2010 the ECB 
launched, in cooperation with the NCBs, 
two educational tools on central banking and 
economics: ﬁ•CONOMIA Œ The Monetary Policy

languages.In 2010 the ECB replied to around 100,000 enquiries from the public requesting 
information on a number of issues related to the 
ECB™s activities, policies and decisions. A number of high-level international conferences were organised in 2010, including 
ﬁThe great Þ nancial crisis: lessons for 
Þ nancial stability and monetary policy Œ a colloquium in 
honour of Lucas Papademosﬂ and the Sixth ECB 
Central Banking Conference, which addressed 
the topic ﬁApproaches to monetary policy 
revisited Œ lessons from the crisisﬂ.To prepare for Estonia joining the euro area on 1 January 2011, a euro information 
campaign was organised in 2010 by the ECB 

and Eesti Pank to familiarise the people of 
Estonia with the visual appearance and security features of the euro banknotes and coins. The 
communication tools used in the campaign 

took into account the experience gained from 
past changeovers and included public opinion 
surveys, as 
many as 20 different types of printed publication (1.6 million copies in 
total) and dedicated internet pages. For the 
Þ rst time since the Euro 2002 Information 
Campaign, TV advertising was 
used (four adverts were aired between November 2010 and 
mid-January 2011). Several press and public 
relations events were held, including an ECB 
media seminar in Frankfurt, as well as an 
exhibition on the euro banknotes and coins 
and a Euro Conference in Tallinn. To mark the launch of the euro information campaign in 
Estonia, on 19 September 2010 a symbolic star 
containing euro banknotes was handed over by 
President Trichet to Governor Lipstok in Tallinn. 
In addition, as part of the communication 
activities on banknotes, an exhibition featuring 
a range of interactive elements and games was 
organised in Berlin, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, 
Warsaw and Tallinn, in cooperation with the 
NCBs and other institutions, such as museums.In 2010 the Cultural Days of the ECB were dedicated to the Netherlands and organised 
in cooperation with De Nederlandsche Bank. 
22 events reß ecting the cultural diversity of the 
Netherlands took place at well-known cultural 
locations in Frankfurt from 20 October to 
15 November. The Cultural Days initiative was 
launched in 2003 with the aim of raising cultural 
awareness and giving residents of the Frankfurt 
area and visitors a ß avour of the culture of a 
different EU Member State each year. On 19 May 2010 the ECB marked the ofÞ cial start of construction works for its new premises by laying the foundation stone 
at the site of the former Grossmarkthalle in Frankfurt am Main. Together with Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, the members of the Executive Board, the Governing Council and the General Council of the ECB, as well as Petra Roth, Lord 
Mayor of the City of Frankfurt am Main, and Wolf D. Prix of COOP HIMMELB(L)AU, Þ lled the foundation stone with a 
set of the building plans, newspapers from all 27 EU Member States, sets of euro coins from the then 16 countries of the euro 
area, a set of euro banknotes and a coin from the City of Frankfurt. The foundation stone was then sealed and moved into the 
excavation pit where the double ofÞ ce tower is to be built.

20101 DECISION-MAKING BODIES AND CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE OF THE ECBThe Eurosystem is the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the ECB and 
the NCBs of the EU Member States whose 
currency is the euro (17 since 1 January 2011). 
The term ﬁEurosystemﬂ, now enshrined in the 
Lisbon Treaty, had earlier been adopted by 
the Governing Council in order to facilitate 
understanding of the structure of central 
banking in the euro area. This term underlines 
the shared identity, teamwork and cooperation 
of all its members.The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the NCBs of all 27 EU Member States, i.e. it also includes the NCBs of the Member States which 
have not yet adopted the euro.The ECB is the core of the Eurosystem and the ESCB and ensures that the operations which 
form part of the tasks of the ESCB are carried 
out either through its own activities or via the 
NCBs, to which the ECB shall have recourse 
to the extent deemed possible and appropriate. 
The Executive Board implements monetary 
policy in accordance with the guidelines and 
decisions laid down by the Governing Council. 
It gives the necessary instructions to the NCBs.

2010international law. The Lisbon Treaty established the ECB as an EU institution. However, 
the institutional features of the ECB remain 
unchanged.Each NCB has legal personality according to the law of its respective country. The euro 
area NCBs, which form an integral part of the 
Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred upon 
the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules 
established by the ECB™s decision-making 
bodies. The NCBs also contribute to the work 
of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through 
their participation in the Eurosystem/ESCB 
committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). 
They may perform non-Eurosystem functions 
on their own responsibility, unless the 
Governing Council Þ nds that such functions 
interfere with the objectives and tasks of the 
Eurosystem. The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the 
Governing Council and the Executive Board. 
The General Council is constituted as a third 
decision-making body of the ECB, for as long 
as there are EU Member States which have not 
yet adopted the euro. The functioning of the 
decision-making bodies is governed by the 
Treaty, the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant 
Rules of Procedure.1 Decision-making within the Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised. 
However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs 
jointly contribute, strategically and operationally, 
to attaining the common goals of the Eurosystem, 
with due respect to the principle of 
decentralisation in accordance with the Statute 
of the ESCB. 1.2 THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
The Governing Council comprises the 
members of the Executive Board of the ECB 
and the governors of the NCBs of the Member 
States which have adopted the euro. Its main 
responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaty, are:to adopt the guidelines and take the decisions  Œ
necessary to ensure the performance of the 
tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem; to formulate the monetary policy of the  Œ
euro area, including, as appropriate, decisions relating to intermediate monetary 
objectives, key interest rates and the supply 
of reserves in the Eurosystem, and to 
establish the necessary guidelines for their 
implementation. The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice 
a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt 
am Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an 
in-depth assessment of monetary and economic 
developments and takes related decisions 
speciÞ cally at its 
Þ rst meeting of the month, 
while the second meeting usually focuses on 
issues related to other tasks and responsibilities 
of the ECB and the Eurosystem. In 2010 
one meeting was held outside Frankfurt, hosted 
by the Banco de Portugal in Lisbon. In addition 
to these meetings, the Governing Council may 
also hold meetings by means of teleconference 
or take decisions by written procedure.When taking decisions on monetary policy and on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, 
the members of the Governing Council do not 
act as national representatives, but in a fully 
independent personal capacity. This is reß ected by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ 
applied within the Governing Council. In 2008 
the Governing Council decided to continue its 
existing voting regime Œ as provided for by 
Article 10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB Œ and to 
introduce a rotation system only when the For the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, see: Decision ECB/2004/2 1 of 19 February 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 33, as amended

The Executive Board comprises the President 
and the Vice-President of the ECB and four other 
members appointed by the European Council, 
acting by qualiÞ ed majority, after consultation 
of the European Parliament and of the ECB. 
The main responsibilities of the Executive Board, 
which as a rule meets once a week, are:to prepare the meetings of the Governing  Œ
Council;
to implement the monetary policy of the  Œ
euro area in accordance with the guidelines 
and decisions laid down by the Governing Council and, in doing so, to give the 
necessary instructions to the euro area 
NCBs;
to manage the current business of the ECB; Œ
to exercise certain powers delegated to it by  Œ
the Governing Council, including some of a 
regulatory nature. The Executive Board is assisted by a 
Management Committee in matters relating to 
the ECB™s management, business planning and 
annual budget process. The Management 
Committee is composed of one Executive Board member, who acts as Chairperson, and a number 
of senior managers.Back row (left to right):Lorenzo Bini Smaghi,José Manuel González-Páramo,Jürgen StarkFront row (left to right):Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell,Jean-Claude Trichet,Vítor ConstâncioDivisions:Archives, Library and Records

The General Council is composed of the President and the Vice-President of the ECB 
and the governors of the NCBs of all 27 EU 
Member States. It mainly carries out those tasks taken over from the EMI which still have to be 
performed by the ECB on account of the fact 
that not all the Member States have adopted the 
euro. In 2010 the General Council had its four 
quarterly meetings, as well as one meeting for 
the adoption of the ECB™s Convergence Report.

2010The Eurosystem/ESCB committees have continued to play an important role in assisting 
the ECB™s decision-making bodies in the 
performance of their tasks. At the request of 
both the Governing Council and the Executive 
Board, the committees have provided expertise in 

their Þ elds of competence and have facilitated 
the decision-making process. Membership of the 
committees is usually restricted to staff of the 
Eurosystem central banks. However, the NCBs 
of the Member States which have not yet adopted 
the euro take part in the meetings of a committee 
whenever it deals with matters that fall within 
the Þ eld of competence of the General Council. 
Where appropriate, other competent bodies, 
such as national supervisory authorities in the 
case of the Banking Supervision Committee, 
may also be invited. On 16 September 2010 the 
Risk Management Committee was established 
to assist the Governing Council in ensuring 
an appropriate level of protection for the 
Eurosystem by managing and controlling the 
risks originating from its market operations. On 
16 December 2010 the Banking Supervision 
Committee was dissolved following the 
establishment of the European Systemic Risk 
Board (see Chapter 6). As at 31 December 2010, 
13 Eurosystem/ESCB committees had been 
established under Article 9.1 of the Rules of 
Procedure of the ECB. On 13 January 2011 the 
Financial Stability Committee was established, 
under the same article, to assist the Governing 
Council in the fulÞ lment of the ECB™s tasks 
relating to Þ nancial stability.
The Budget Committee, which was established 
under Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure, 
assists the Governing Council in matters related 
to the ECB™s budget. The Human Resources Conference was 
established in 2005 under Article 9a of the 
Rules of Procedure as a forum for the exchange 
of experience, expertise and information among 
Eurosystem/ESCB central banks in the Þ eld of 
human resources management.The Eurosystem IT Steering Committee was 
established in 2007 by the Governing Council, with a mandate to steer continuous improvement 
in the use of IT within the Eurosystem.1.6 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In addition to the decision-making bodies, the 
corporate governance of the ECB encompasses 
a number of external and internal control layers, 
two codes of conduct, an Ethics Framework 
and rules concerning public access to ECB 
documents. EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe Statute of the ESCB provides for two 
control layers, namely the external auditor, 
which is appointed to audit the annual accounts 
of the ECB (Article 27.1 of the Statute of the 
ESCB), and the European Court of Auditors, 
which examines the operational efÞ ciency of the 
management of the ECB (Article 27.2). 
The annual report of the European Court of 
Auditors, together with the ECB™s reply, is 
published on the ECB™s website and in the 
OfÞ cial Journal of the European Union. In order 
to reinforce public assurance as to the 
independence of the ECB™s external auditor, the 
principle of audit Þ rm rotation is applied.
 3 Good practices for the selection and mandate of 
external auditors, published on the ECB™s 
website, provide high-level guidance for each 
Eurosystem central bank when selecting external 
auditors and determining their mandate. 
The good practices also enable the Governing 
Council to formulate its recommendations to the  

Council on the basis of harmonised, consistent 
and transparent selection criteria.INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe internal control structure of the ECB is based 
on an approach in which each organisational 
unit (section, division, directorate or directorate 
general) is responsible for managing its own risks 
and controls, as well as the effectiveness and Following the conclusion of a tender procedure and in line with the 3 agreed practice of rotating audit Þ rms, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was appointed 
as the ECB™s external auditor for the Þ nancial years 2008-12.
199ECBAnnual Report
2010efÞ ciency of its operations. Each organisational 
unit implements operational control procedures within its area of responsibility in accordance 
with the risk tolerance set ex ante by the 
Executive Board. For example, a set of rules and 
procedures Œ known as a ﬁChinese wallﬂ Œ is in 
place to prevent inside information originating 
in the areas responsible for monetary policy 
from reaching the areas responsible for the 
management of the ECB™s foreign reserves and 
own funds portfolio. In 2010 the ECB further reÞ ned its approach 
to operational risk management and continued, together with the NCBs, to implement the 
operational risk management framework for 
Eurosystem tasks and processes. The business 
areas of the ECB also updated their operational 
risk assessments. The ECB regularly tests and 
reviews the business continuity arrangements 
for its critical operations. Furthermore, in 
2010 the ECB reviewed its crisis management 
framework and conducted a training programme 
for the crisis management team. Following the 
Governing Council™s approval of the roll-out of 
the Eurosystem business continuity framework 
in 2009, the procedures for a business 
impact analysis at the Eurosystem level were 
developed. Moreover, in December 2010 the newly established Risk Management Committee 
(RMC) met for the Þ rst time. One of its main 
tasks is to provide for an integrated assessment 
of all Þ nancial risks that the Eurosystem faces 
in its market operations, which include the 
Eurosystem™s monetary policy and intraday 
credit operations, foreign exchange operations, 
as well as operations related to the management 
of the ECB™s foreign reserves. Independently from the internal control structure and risk monitoring of the ECB, audit missions 
are performed by the Directorate Internal Audit 
under the direct responsibility of the Executive 
Board. In accordance with the mandate deÞ ned in the ECB Audit Charter,4 the ECB™s internal auditors provide independent and objective 
assurance and consulting services, bringing a systematic approach to evaluating and improving 

the effectiveness of risk management, control 
and governance processes. The ECB™s internal 
audit activities conform with the International 
Standards for the Professional Practice of 
Internal Auditing of the Institute of Internal 
Auditors. A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal Auditors Committee, which is composed of 
the heads of internal audit at the ECB and the 
NCBs, is responsible for coordinating the 
auditing of Eurosystem/ESCB joint projects and 
operational systems. An ECB Audit Committee further enhances the corporate governance of the ECB and 
the Eurosystem as a whole. It is composed of 
three Governing Council members, with Erkki 
Liikanen (Governor of Suomen Pankki Œ 
Finlands Bank) as Chairman.CODES OF CONDUCTTwo codes of conduct are applicable to the 
members of the ECB™s decision-making bodies. 
The Þ rst code of conduct gives guidance to, and 
sets ethical standards for, the members of the 
Governing Council and their alternates when 
exercising their functions as members of the 
Governing Council. It reß ects their responsibility 
to safeguard the integrity and reputation of the 
Eurosystem and to maintain the effectiveness 
of its operations.5 An Ethics Adviser has been appointed by the Governing Council to provide 
guidance to its members on aspects of 
professional conduct. The second code is 
the Supplementary Code of Ethics Criteria 
for the members of the Executive Board.6 It complements the other code of conduct by 
further detailing the ethical regime applicable 
to members of the Executive Board. This charter is published on the ECB™s website to foster the 4 transparency of audit arrangements in place at the ECB.See the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing 5 Council, OJ C 123, 24.5.2002, p. 9, its amendment, OJ C 10, 
16.1.2007, p. 6, and the ECB™s website.
See the Supplementary Code of Ethics Criteria for the members 6 of the Executive Board of the ECB, OJ C 104, 23.4.2010, p. 8, 
and the ECB™s website. 200ECBAnnual Report
2010On 1 April 2010 a comprehensive Ethics Framework for members of staff of the ECB 
entered into force.7 It consolidated and enhanced the ethical rules applying to staff of the ECB as 
laid down in the Conditions of Employment, the 
Staff Rules and the former Code of Conduct of 
the ECB.8 The Framework provides guidance and sets ethics conventions, standards and 
benchmarks. All staff are expected to maintain 
high standards of professional ethical behaviour 
in the performance of their duties, as well as in 
their relations with NCBs, public authorities, 
market participants, media representatives and 
the public in general. An Ethics OfÞ cer appointed by the Executive Board ensures a 
consistent interpretation of the rules applicable 
to Executive Board members and staff. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURESIn 1999 the European Parliament and the 

Council adopted a Regulation 9 to step up the Þ ght against fraud, corruption and any other 
illegal activity detrimental to the Communities™ 
Þ nancial interests. The Regulation provides, 
inter alia, for the internal investigation of 
suspected fraud by the European Anti-Fraud 
OfÞ ce (OLAF) within the EU institutions, 
bodies, ofÞ ces and agencies. The OLAF 
Regulation foresees that each of the latter adopt 
decisions in order for OLAF to be able to carry 
out its investigations within each of them. In 
June 2004 the Governing Council adopted a 
Decision 10 concerning the terms and conditions for investigations by OLAF of the ECB, which 
entered into force on 1 July 2004. INTERNAL ECB ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING/
COUNTER-TERRORIST FINANCING PROGRAMMEIn 2007 the ECB established its internal 
anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-
terrorist Þ nancing (CTF) scheme. The design 
of the AML/CTF provisions is in line with 
the 40 recommendations and nine special 
recommendations of the Financial Action Task 
Force (FATF), to the extent that they are applicable 

to the ECB™s operations. A compliance function 
within the ECB identiÞ es, analyses and addresses 
the risks associated with money laundering and 
terrorist Þ nancing for all relevant activities of 
the ECB. In particular, ensuring compliance 
with applicable AML/CTF legislation is part 
of the process of assessing and monitoring the 
eligibility of the ECB™s counterparties. In this 
context, particular attention is paid to restrictive 
measures adopted by the EU and public 
statements issued by the FATF. An internal 
reporting system complements the ECB™s 
AML/CTF framework to ensure that all relevant 
information is systematically collected and duly 
communicated to the Executive Board. PUBLIC ACCESS TO ECB DOCUMENTSThe ECB™s decision on public access to ECB 
documents,11 adopted in March 2004, is in line with the objectives and standards applied by 
other EU institutions and bodies with regard to 
public access to their documents. It enhances 
transparency, while at the same time taking into 
account the independence of the ECB and of the 
NCBs and ensuring the conÞ dentiality of certain 
matters speciÞ c to the performance of the ECB™s 
tasks.12 In 2010 the number of public access requests 
remained limited. See Part 0 of the ECB Staff Rules containing the Ethics 7 Framework, OJ C 104, 23.4.2010, p. 3, and the ECB™s website.See the former Code of Conduct of the European Central Bank 8 in accordance with Article 11.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the

2010ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS2 2.1 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
In 2010 the ECB continued to develop and implement human resources management 
policies in four areas: corporate culture, 
recruitment, professional development and 
employment conditions. CORPORATE CULTURE 
In 2010 developments related to the corporate 
culture of the ECB focused on diversity and 
professional ethics. A number of activities were 
initiated in order to raise awareness of the ECB™s 
gender diversity objectives and embed them 
more deeply in the regular human resources 
operations. To mark the ECB™s commitment in 
this respect, a public statement on diversity was 
published on the ECB™s website. With regard to 
professional ethics, an Ethics Framework for the 
members of staff of the ECB entered into force 
in 2010, as discussed in greater detail in the 
previous section.RECRUITMENTOn 31 December 2010 the actual full-time 
equivalent number of staff holding employment 
contracts with the ECB was 1,607 (1,563 on 
31 December 2009).13 A total of 53 new Þ xed-term contracts (limited in nature or convertible 
to permanent contracts) were offered in 2010. 
By contrast, 28 members of staff employed on a 
Þ xed-term or permanent basis left the ECB 
in 2010 (27 in 2009), following resignation or 
retirement. Furthermore, to cover for absences 
of less than one year, 128 short-term contracts 
were issued during 2010 (in addition to some 
contract extensions), while 140 short-term 
contracts expired in the course of the year.The ECB continued to offer short-term contracts to staff from NCBs and international 
organisations, thus fostering an ESCB-wide 
team spirit and cooperation with international 
organisations. On 31 December 2010, 
158 employees from NCBs and international 
organisations were working at the ECB on 
various assignments, 12% more than in 2009.In September 2010 the ECB welcomed the Þ fth intake of participants in its Graduate Programme. 
The participants, who are recent graduates from 
leading universities, have a broad educational 
background and are each assigned to two 
business areas on a rotational basis for a total 
period of two years. As in previous years, traineeship opportunities were offered throughout the year to students 
and graduates with backgrounds in economics, 
statistics, business administration, law and 
translation. The ECB published the rules 
governing its traineeship programme on its 
website in April 2010 in order to provide more 
clarity on the eligibility criteria, assignment 
duration, leave and medical coverage. 
On 31 December 2010, 92 trainees were being 
hosted by the ECB (12.8% more than in 2009). 
The ECB also offered four fellowships as part 
of the Wim Duisenberg Research Fellowship 
Programme, which is open to leading 
economists, and Þ ve fellowships to young 
researchers in the context of its Lamfalussy 
Fellowship Programme.PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
Mobility and staff development measures 
continued to be the main tools for professional 
development at the ECB.The ECB™s internal mobility policy enables the ECB to broaden staff awareness and to increase 
synergies across business areas. The ECB™s 
internal recruitment policy also aims to facilitate 
internal mobility by placing emphasis on broad 
competencies. In the course of 2010, 204 staff 
members, including 37 managers and advisers, 
moved internally to other positions, on either a 
temporary or a long-term basis.In addition to contracts based on full-time equivalent positions, 13 this Þ gure includes, inter alia, short-term contracts awarded to 
staff seconded from NCBs and international organisations and contracts awarded to Graduate Programme participants.202ECBAnnual Report
2010The ECB, like all ESCB central banks, actively participates in the external work 
experience scheme promoted by the Human 
Resources Conference, which enables the 
ECB to second staff to the 27 NCBs in the 
EU or to relevant international organisations 
(e.g. the IMF and the BIS) for periods of two 
to twelve months. A total of eight members 
of staff were seconded under this scheme 
in 2010 (new cases). In addition, the ECB 
granted unpaid leave, for up to three years, 
to 36 members of staff (new cases). The total 
number of staff members on unpaid leave at the 
end of December 2010 was 45 (compared with 
55 in 2009). The ECB continued to promote the acquisition and development of skills and the enhancement 
of the competencies of management and staff. 
In addition to numerous in-house training 
opportunities, staff and management continued 
to take up external training opportunities to 
address individual training needs of a more 
ﬁtechnicalﬂ nature. They also beneÞ ted from 
opportunities organised as part of ESCB training 
programmes or training offered by the NCBs.EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONSThe ECB™s employment conditions are 
designed to be attractive and to balance the 
needs of staff with those of the organisation. 
The ECB is reviewing some of its working 
time and leave provisions, with the aim of 
further facilitating the processing of part-time 
requests. At the end of 2010, 158 staff members 
were working part-time, 10% less than in 2009. 
The number of staff on unpaid parental leave as 
at 31 December 2010 was 24 (compared with 28 
in 2009). The teleworking pilot project launched 
in 2008 continued during 2010. On average, 
around 235 staff members teleworked each 
month. In 2010 as a whole, 662 staff teleworked 
at least once.The ECB continued to support staff in the areas of childcare and the reconciliation of work and 
family commitments. Policies for parents with 
children affected by serious illness or imperative educational needs were enhanced to include 
extended support for the parents of children 
with learning disabilities or neuro-behavioural 
development disorders. 2.2 STAFF RELATIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE 
The ECB fully recognises the importance of a 
constructive dialogue with its staff. In 2010 
the ECB consulted the staff representatives on 
remuneration, employment, working conditions, 
health and safety conditions, and pensions. 
It continued to have a regular dialogue with 
staff representatives on employment and 
social matters. A discussion with the recognised trade union on the memorandum of understanding between 
the ECB and the trade union is ongoing, with a 
view to further enhancing the social dialogue at 
the ECB. 2.3 NEW ECB PREMISES 
The ofÞ cial start of the main construction works 
for the ECB™s new headquarters in Frankfurt™s 
Ostend was marked by a ceremony on 
19 May 2010 in which the foundation stone was 
laid. In June the steel work for the foundations 
for the double ofÞ ce tower and the underground 
staff car park began, followed by the concreting 
works in July. By the beginning of 2011 the 
two storeys of the underground staff car park 
and the basement of the double ofÞ ce tower had 
been Þ nalised, and the structural works on the 
ground ß oor had started.
In parallel, the construction works began on the 
former Grossmarkthalle building. In preparation 
for the construction of the entrance building, 
the facade and the three roof segments in the 
western part of the former wholesale market 
hall were removed. The basement of the market 
hall was also removed, to be replaced by a 
waterproof basement which will be able to 
carry the weight of the new structural elements 203ECBAnnual Report
2010housing the ECB™s more public functions, i.e. a visitors™ centre, conference area, cafeteria 
and staff restaurant.In close coordination with the historic preservation authorities, the restoration works 
for the former Grossmarkthalle also began in 
spring 2010 with the careful restoration of the 
brick facade and the ribbed concrete ß oor of 
the eastern wing building. Thorough restoration 
works on the substance of the building are 
ongoing in order to preserve the structure of the 
Grossmarkthalle.In February 2011 the ECB awarded the contract for the structural works for the double 
ofÞ ce tower to a new construction company. 
The initial company Baresel GmbH completed 
the structural works up to the ground ß oor, with Ed. Züblin AG being engaged to carry 
out the remainder. All construction works are 
proceeding as planned. The date for completion 
of the new premises remains unchanged and is 
scheduled for the end of 2013, with the ECB 
moving in thereafter, i.e. in 2014.2.4 THE EUROSYSTEM PROCUREMENT 
COORDINATION OFFICE 
In 2010 the Eurosystem Procurement 
Coordination OfÞ ce (EPCO) 
Þ nalised two joint 
procedures initiated in 2009: air transport for 
ESCB meetings and global hotel agreements. 
In addition, EPCO coordinated a number of 
analyses initiated in 2009 which should either 
be Þ nalised or lead to joint procurements in 
the coming months. The areas covered by such 
analyses included market data providers and 
rating agencies, ofÞ ce supplies and standard IT 
software tools. EPCO also continued to promote 
the exchange of best practices in the Þ eld of 
procurement among central banks. At its meeting on 15 December 2010 the Governing Council took note of the document 
ﬁEPCO Œ Review of experience at the 
half-way stage of the mandate (2008-2012)ﬂ, which provided an opportunity to analyse the 
experience gained in the Þ rst half of EPCO™s 
Þ ve-year mandate and to reorient its activities 
for the remainder of the mandate. 2.5 ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
The ECB is an environmentally aware institution. 
It makes prudent use of natural resources in 
order to preserve the quality of the environment 
and to protect human health. In 2010 the Environmental Management System of the ECB was successfully certiÞ ed. It complies with the international standard 
EN ISO 14001 and the EU™s Eco-Management 
and Audit Scheme. The ECB aims to 
continuously improve the system and the ECB™s 
environmental performance. A comparison 
of the data for 2008 and 2009 revealed a 22% 
reduction in carbon emissions over this period. 
With the objective of further reducing the 
ECB™s ecological footprint, a new environmental 
programme has been launched for 2010-11.The ECB has published an environmental statement on its website providing detailed 
information on the environmental performance 
of the ECB. Furthermore, the voluntary objectives of the European Commission™s GreenBuilding 
Programme are being applied in the construction 
of the ECB™s new premises. This programme, 
which was launched in 2004, aims to improve  

energy efÞ ciency and extend the use of 
renewable energies in non-residential buildings 
in Europe. 2.6 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICE 
MANAGEMENT 
The Directorate General Information Systems 
completed the implementation of its new 
organisational structure in 2010. Particular 
attention was paid to strategy implementation, 204ECBAnnual Report
2010the work programme for 2010 and the continuous improvement of processes following 
the ISO certiÞ cations obtained in 2009.
Throughout the year, work focused on the 
preparation of the IT services needed to support 
the establishment of the European Systemic 
Risk Board and the smooth entry of Estonia into 
the euro area. As a consequence of the Þ nancial crisis, several applications underwent urgent 
changes and had to be operated over extended 
working hours and weekends. Various projects were initiated to strengthen the compliance of IT applications with 
ESCB security policies. Steps were also 
taken to modernise systems supporting the 
implementation of monetary policy decisions and 
to complete projects supporting administrative 
processes. 205ECBAnnual Report
2010The activities of the Human Resources Conference and its Task Force on Training and 
Development covered several aspects of human 
resources management in 2010, including ESCB 
mobility. The provision of ESCB training was further extended by the roll-out of: i) the ESCB 
Project Management Training Programme, 
which consists of several modules on project 
management methodology and soft skills 
needed in a project environment, and ii) a 
training course on audit report writing and 
communication. For 2011 the training calendar 
foresees a total of 57 sessions of ESCB training 
activities, hosted by 22 central banks. 3 THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE
206ECBAnnual Report
2010The ESCB Social Dialogue is a consultative forum involving the ECB and employee 
representatives from the central banks of the 
ESCB and from European trade union 
federations.14 Its purpose is to provide information and foster exchanges of views on 
issues that may have a major impact on 
employment conditions at the central banks of 
the ESCB. This information is provided in a 
biannual newsletter and at meetings held in 
Frankfurt twice a year. In 2010 the ESCB Social Dialogue meetings focused on Þ nancial supervision, the 
establishment of the European Systemic Risk 
Board and the actions taken by the ECB in times 
of crisis. Issues relating to banknote production 
and circulation, market operations and payment 
systems were also discussed. The ad hoc working group on banknote production and circulation continued to 
address technical issues complementing those 
discussed in the plenary meeting of the ESCB 
Social Dialogue. The working group on the 
ESCB Social Dialogue reconvened in May and 
September and, among other things, identiÞ ed possible items to be included in the agenda of 
the ESCB Social Dialogue meetings. The Standing Committee of European Central Bank Unions 14 (SCECBU), Union Network International Œ Europa (UNI-Europa Finance) and the European Federation of Public Service Unions

2010MANAGEMENT REPORT FOR THE YEAR 
ENDING 31 DECEMBER 20101 NATURE OF THE BUSINESS
The ECB™s activities in 2010 are described in detail in the relevant chapters of the Annual 
Report.2 OBJECTIVES AND TASKS
The ECB™s objectives and tasks are described 
in the Statute of the ESCB (Articles 2 and 3). 
An overview of performance against these 
objectives is included in the President™s 
foreword to the Annual Report. 3 KEY RESOURCES, RISKS AND PROCESSES
GOVERNANCE OF THE ECBThe Executive Board, the Governing Council and the General Council are the decision-making 
bodies of the ECB. The ECB™s governance framework includes a variety of controls and audit measures. 
For example, the European Court of Auditors 
reviews the operational efÞ ciency of the 
management of the ECB, while an external 
auditor is appointed to audit the ECB™s Annual 
Accounts. To reinforce the independence of the 
external auditor, the ECB appoints a different 
external audit Þ rm every 
Þ ve years. In order 
to further strengthen the ECB™s corporate 
governance, the Governing Council established 
the ECB Audit Committee in 2007. The ECB has, over time, established a set of internal rules regarding the business practices 
and standards of professional conduct to 
be followed by all ECB staff. For example, 
the Business Practice Handbook, which entered 
into force in 2007 and is regularly updated, 
provides information on business objectives 
and practices in an accessible and user-friendly 
manner, helping employees to meet their 
professional obligations.Within the internal control structure of the 
ECB, each organisational unit is responsible 
for managing its own risks and implementing 
its own controls, as well as for the effectiveness 
and efÞ ciency of its operations. In addition, 
independent audit missions are performed by 
the Directorate Internal Audit under the direct 
responsibility of the Executive Board. Further information relating to the governance of the ECB is provided in Chapter 10 of the 
Annual Report.MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARDThe members of the Executive Board are 
appointed from among persons of recognised 
standing and professional experience in 
monetary or banking matters by the European 
Council, upon a recommendation from the 
EU Council after it has consulted the European 
Parliament and the Governing Council.The terms and conditions of members™ employment are determined by the Governing 
Council, based on a proposal from a committee 
comprising three members appointed by 
the Governing Council and three members 
appointed by the EU Council.The emoluments of the members of the Executive Board are set out in note 32, 
ﬁStaff costsﬂ, of the Annual Accounts.EMPLOYEESThe ECB is fully cognisant of the importance of 
developing sound human resources management 
policies and of having a constructive dialogue 
with its staff. In 2010 developments related 
to the corporate culture of the ECB focused 
on diversity and professional ethics. A new 
comprehensive ethics framework for the staff 
of the ECB entered into force on 1 April 2010. 
The framework provides guidance and sets 
ethics conventions, standards and benchmarks. 
All staff are expected to maintain high standards 210ECBAnnual Report
2010of professional ethical behaviour in the performance of their duties, as well as in their 
relations with NCBs, public authorities, market 
participants, media representatives and the 
general public. Mobility and staff development measures continued to be the main tools for professional 
development in 2010. Moreover, the ECB 
continued to support staff in the areas of 
childcare and the reconciliation of work and 
family commitments.The average number of staff (full-time equivalents) holding contracts with the ECB 1 rose from 1,530 in 2009 to 1,565 in 2010. 
At the end of 2010 1,607 staff were employed. 
For further information, see note 32, ﬁStaff 
costsﬂ, of the Annual Accounts and Section 2 of 
Chapter 10 of the Annual Report which also 
describes developments in the area of human 
resources management in more detail.INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserves portfolio consists 
of foreign reserve assets transferred to it by the 

euro area NCBs in accordance with the provisions 

of Article 30 of the Statute of the ESCB. The 

main purpose of the ECB™s foreign reserves is 

to ensure that, whenever needed, the Eurosystem 

has a sufÞ cient amount of liquid resources for its 
foreign exchange policy operations. 
The ECB™s own funds portfolio reß ects the 
investment of (a) its paid-up capital; (b) the counterpart of the provision for foreign exchange 
rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks; 
(c) the general reserve fund; and (d) income 
accumulated on the portfolio in previous years. 
Its purpose is primarily to provide the ECB with 
income to contribute to covering its operating 
expenses.The ECB is exposed to Þ nancial risks arising 
in respect of both of the above-mentioned portfolios. They include credit, market and 
liquidity risks. The ECB closely monitors and 
measures such risks and, where appropriate, mitigates them through the implementation of 
a risk management framework that includes, 
in particular, a system of exposure limits.The ECB™s investment activities and its management of the associated risks are 
described in greater detail in Chapter 2 of the 
Annual Report.BUDGET PROCESSSpending against agreed budgets is monitored 
regularly by the Executive Board, taking 
into account the advice of the ECB™s internal 
controlling function, and by the Governing 
Council with the assistance of the Budget 
Committee (BUCOM). BUCOM, composed 
of ECB and euro area NCB experts, is a key 
contributor to the ECB™s Þ nancial governance 
process. In accordance with Article 15 of the 
ECB™s Rules of Procedure, BUCOM supports 
the Governing Council by providing a detailed 
evaluation of the ECB™s annual budget proposals 
and requests for supplementary budget funding 
by the Executive Board, prior to their submission 
to the Governing Council for approval. 4 FINANCIAL RESOURCES
CAPITAL 
Pursuant to the Statute of the ESCB, as well as Council Regulation (EC) No 1009/2000 of 
8 May 2000, the ECB decided in December 2010 

to increase its subscribed capital by •5 billion, 
from •5.8 billion to •10.8 billion. This decision resulted from an assessment of the adequacy of its statutory capital, which 
was launched in 2009. The capital increase 
was deemed appropriate in view of increased 
volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest 
rates and gold prices, as well as in view of the 
ECB™s exposure to credit risk. Staff on unpaid leave are excluded. This number includes staff 1 with permanent, Þ xed or short-term contracts and the participants 
in the ECB™s Graduate Programme. Staff on maternity or long-term sick leave are also included.211ECBAnnual Report
2010In order to smooth the transfer of capital to the ECB, the Governing Council decided that the 
euro area NCBs should pay their additional 
capital contributions of •3,489,575,000 in three 
equal annual instalments. On 29 December 2010 
the NCBs of the euro area (in its composition as 
at that date) paid •1,163,191,667 as their Þ rst instalment. The remaining two instalments will 
be paid at the end of 2011 and 2012. Moreover, 
the minimal percentage of the subscribed capital, 
which the non-euro area NCBs are required 
to pay as a contribution to the operational 
costs of the ECB was reduced from 7.00% to 
3.75%. Consequently, the capital paid up by 
the non-euro area NCBs was slightly adjusted 
and payments totalling •84,220 were made on 
29 December 2010. As a result of these payments, the ECB™s 
paid-up capital amounted to •5,306 million on 

31 December 2010, compared with •4,142 million 

on 31 December 2009. Detailed information 

on these changes is provided in note 17, 

ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ, of the Annual Accounts.PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, 

INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND GOLD PRICE RISKS 
Since most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities 
are periodically revalued at current market 
exchange rates and security prices, the ECB™s 
proÞ tability is strongly affected by exchange rate 
exposures and, to a lesser extent, interest rate 
exposures. These exposures stem mainly from 
its holdings of gold and foreign reserve assets 
denominated in US dollars and Japanese yen, 
which are predominantly invested in interest-
bearing instruments.In 2005, taking into account the ECB™s large exposure to these risks and the size of its 
revaluation accounts, the Governing Council 
decided to establish a provision for foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks. 
In 2009, following the establishment of the 
programme for the purchase of covered bonds 
(see note 5, ﬁSecurities of euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ, of the Annual Accounts), 
the Governing Council decided to extend 
the scope of the risk provision to also cover 
credit risk. As at 31 December 2009 this provision amounted 
to •4,020,445,722. In line with the Statute of 
the ESCB, the risk provision together with any 
amounts held in the ECB™s general reserve 
fund may not exceed the value of the capital 
paid up by the euro area NCBs. After taking 
the results of its risk assessment into account, 
the Governing Council decided to increase the 
size of the risk provision to •5,183,637,388, 
which, following the capital increase, represents 
the current maximum allowed ceiling.The size of and continuing requirement for this 
provision is reviewed annually, taking a range of 

factors into account, including in particular the 

level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent 

of materialised risk exposures in the current 

Þ nancial year, projected results for the coming 
year, and a risk assessment involving calculations 

of Values at Risk (VaR) on risk-bearing assets, 

which is applied consistently over time.5 FINANCIAL RESULTS
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTSUnder Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 
by the Executive Board, in accordance with 
the principles established by the Governing 
Council. The accounts are then approved by the 
Governing Council and subsequently published.FINANCIAL RESULT FOR 2010In 2010 the net income of the ECB prior 
to the transfer to the risk provision was 
•1,334 million, compared with •2,218 million in 
2009. The net proÞ t, amounting to •171 million 
after this transfer, was distributed to the euro 
area NCBs in March 2011.212ECBAnnual Report
2010In 2010 net interest income amounted to •1,422 million, compared with •1,547 million 
in 2009. The decrease in net interest income was 
mainly due to (a) the realisation of a net interest 
expense from TARGET2 balances in 2010; 
(b) lower net interest income on foreign reserve 
assets that was due mainly to lower average 
interest rates on US dollar-denominated assets 
in 2010; and (c) a decrease in interest income on 
the ECB™s share of euro banknotes in circulation, 
which reß ected the fact that the average rate for 
the Eurosystem™s main reÞ nancing operations 
declined. These factors were partially offset 
by the following: (a) additional income 
generated on the securities purchased under the 
Securities Markets Programme and the covered 
bond purchase programme; (b) lower interest 
expenses as a result of decreased balances with 
the Swiss National Bank; and (c) a decrease in 
the interest expense arising from the euro area 
NCBs™ claims in respect of the foreign reserve 
assets transferred by them to the ECB.Net realised gains arising from Þ nancial operations decreased from •1,103 million in 2009 to •474 million in 2010, owing mainly to 
(a) the fact that no gold sales were conducted 
by the ECB in 2010, and (b) lower net realised 
gains from security sales in 2010.Write-downs amounted to •195 million in 2010, compared with •38 million in 2009, mainly 
owing to unrealised price losses on security 
holdings which are shown on the Balance Sheet 
at their market value as at end-2010.As at end-2009 unrealised foreign exchange gains, mainly arising on the US dollar portfolio 
and the Japanese yen portfolio, amounted 
to •2,070 million, and unrealised gold price 
gains amounted to •8,418 million. In 2010 the 
depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the Japanese 
yen and the US dollar resulted in an increase in 
unrealised foreign exchange gains, which rose 
to •6,271 million, while the rise in the price of 
gold during 2010 led to unrealised gold price 
gains amounting to •13,079 million. In line with 
the Eurosystem™s accounting policies, these 
gains were recorded in revaluation accounts.Total administrative expenses of the ECB, including depreciation, amounted to •415 million in 2010, compared with •401 million in 2009.214ECBAnnual Report

Frankfurt am Main, 22 February 2011EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKJean-Claude TrichetPresident217ECBAnnual Report
2010FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTSThe Þ nancial statements of the ECB have been 
designed to present fairly the Þ nancial position 
of the ECB and the results of its operations. 
They have been drawn up in accordance with 
the following accounting policies, 2 which the Governing Council of the ECB considers to 
be appropriate to the nature of central bank 
activity.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have 
been applied: economic reality and transparency, 
prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet 
events, materiality, going concern, the accruals 
principle, consistency and comparability.RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAn asset or liability is only recognised in 
the Balance Sheet when it is probable that 
any associated future economic beneÞ t will 
ß ow to or from the ECB, substantially all of 
the associated risks and rewards have been 
transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of 
the asset or the amount of the obligation can be 
measured reliably.BASIS OF ACCOUNTINGThe accounts have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis, modiÞ ed to include the market 
valuation of marketable securities (other than 
those classiÞ ed as held-to-maturity), gold and 
all other on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency. Transactions in Þ nancial assets and 
liabilities are reß ected in the accounts on the 
basis of the date on which they were settled.With the exception of securities, transactions in Þ nancial instruments denominated in foreign 
currency are recorded in off-balance-sheet 
accounts on the trade date. At the settlement 
date the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed 
and transactions are booked on-balance-sheet. Purchases and sales of foreign currency affect 
the net foreign currency position on the trade 
date, and realised results arising from sales are 
also calculated on that date. Accrued interest, 
premiums and discounts related to Þ nancial instruments denominated in foreign currency are 
calculated and recorded daily, and the foreign 
currency position is also affected daily by these 
accruals.GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND 

LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency are converted into euro at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expenses are converted at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. 
The revaluation of foreign exchange assets 
and liabilities, including on-balance-sheet and 
off-balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a 
currency-by-currency basis.Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
is treated separately from the exchange rate 
revaluation.Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the year-end. No distinction is made between 
the price and currency revaluation differences 
for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is 
accounted for on the basis of the price in euro 
per Þ ne ounce of gold, which, for the year 
ending 31 December 2010, was derived from the 
exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar 
on 31 December 2010.The special drawing right (SDR) is deÞ ned in terms of a basket of currencies. To revalue the ECB™s holdings of SDRs, the value of the ACCOUNTING POLICIES1Decision ECB/2006/17 of 10 November 2006, OJ L 348, 1 11.12.2006, p. 38, as amended, containing the detailed accounting policies of the ECB, was repealed and replaced by Decision 
ECB/2010/21 of 11 November 2010, OJ L 35, 9.2.2011, p. 1, 
with effect from 31 December 2010.
These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 2 of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach 
to the rules governing the accounting and Þ nancial reporting of 
Eurosystem operations.218ECBAnnual Report
2010SDR was calculated as a weighted sum of theexchange rates of four major currencies (the 
US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound sterling) 
against the euro as at 31 December 2010.SECURITIESMarketable securities (other than those classiÞ ed as held-to-maturity) and similar assets are valued 
either at the mid-market prices or on the basis of 
the relevant yield curve prevailing on the balance 
sheet date, on a security-by-security basis. For 
the year ending 31 December 2010, mid-market 
prices on 30 December 2010 were used.Marketable securities classiÞ ed as held-to-
maturity and illiquid equity shares are all valued at cost subject to impairment.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the 
period in which they are earned or incurred. 
Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of 
foreign exchange, gold and securities are taken 
to the ProÞ t and Loss Account. Such realised 
gains and losses are calculated by reference to 
the average cost of the respective asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income but are transferred directly to a revaluation 
account.Unrealised losses are taken to the ProÞ t and 
Loss Account if, at the year-end, they exceed previous revaluation gains registered in the 
corresponding revaluation account. Unrealised 
losses on any one security or currency or on 
gold are not netted against unrealised gains on 
other securities or currencies or gold. In the 
event of an unrealised loss on any item taken to 
the ProÞ t and Loss Account, the average cost of 
that item is reduced to the year-end exchange 
rate or market price.Impairment losses are taken to the ProÞ t and 
Loss Account and are not reversed in subsequent years unless the impairment decreases and the decrease can be related to an observable event 
that occurred after the impairment was Þ rst recorded.Premiums or discounts arising on purchased securities, including those classiÞ ed as 
held-to-maturity, are calculated and presented 
as part of interest income and are amortised over 
the remaining life of the securities.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby 
the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase 
agreement or conducts credit operations against 
collateral.Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement 
to repurchase them from the counterparty at an 
agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase 
agreements are recorded as collateralised inward 
deposits on the liability side of the Balance 
Sheet and lead to an interest expense in the 
ProÞ t and Loss Account. Securities sold under 
such an agreement remain on the Balance Sheet 
of the ECB.Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous 
agreement to sell them back to the counterparty 
at an agreed price on a set future date. 
Reverse repurchase agreements are recorded 
as collateralised loans on the asset side of the 
Balance Sheet but are not included in the ECB™s 
security holdings. They give rise to interest 
income in the ProÞ t and Loss Account.
Reverse transactions (including security lending 
transactions) conducted under an automated 
security lending programme are recorded on the 
Balance Sheet only where collateral is provided 
in the form of cash placed on an account of 
the ECB. In 2010 the ECB did not receive any 
collateral in the form of cash in connection with 
such transactions.219ECBAnnual Report
2010OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 
exchange swaps and other currency instruments 
involving an exchange of one currency for 
another at a future date, are included in the net 
foreign currency position for the purpose of 
calculating foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation 

margin of open interest rate futures contracts 

are recorded in the ProÞ t and Loss Account. 
The valuation of forward transactions in securities 

and of interest rate swaps is based on generally 

accepted valuation methods using observable 

market prices and rates, as well as discount factors 

from the settlement dates to the valuation date.POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTSThe values of assets and liabilities are adjusted 
for events that occur between the annual balance 
sheet date and the date on which the Governing 
Council approves the Þ nancial statements, 
if such events materially affect the condition of 
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Important post-balance-sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the 
balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes.INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM 

BALANCESIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-border 
transactions that occur between two EU central 
banks. Intra-ESCB transactions in euro are 
primarily processed via TARGET2 Œ the 
Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross 
settlement Express Transfer system (see 
Chapter 2 of the Annual Report) Œ and give rise 
to bilateral balances in accounts held between 
those EU central banks connected to TARGET2. 
These bilateral balances are then assigned to the 
ECB on a daily basis, leaving each NCB with a 
single net bilateral position vis-à-vis the ECB 
only. This position in the books of the ECB represents the net claim or liability of each NCB 
against the rest of the ESCB. Intra-Eurosystem 
balances of euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB 
arising from TARGET2, as well as other 
intra-Eurosystem balances denominated in euro 
(e.g. interim proÞ t distributions to NCBs), 
are presented on the Balance Sheet of the ECB 
as a single net asset or liability position and 
disclosed under ﬁOther claims within the 
Eurosystem (net)ﬂ or ﬁOther liabilities within 
the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ. Intra-ESCB balances of 
non-euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB, arising 
from their participation in TARGET2, 3 are disclosed under ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area 
residents denominated in euroﬂ.Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem are included as a single net 
asset under ﬁClaims related to the allocation 
of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ 
(see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB by 
NCBs joining the Eurosystem are denominated 
in euro and reported under ﬁLiabilities equivalent 
to the transfer of foreign reservesﬂ.TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETSFixed assets, with the exception of land and works 
of art, are valued at cost less depreciation. Land 
and works of art are valued at cost. Depreciation 
is calculated on a straight-line basis, beginning 
in the quarter after acquisition and continuing 
over the period for which the asset is expected to 
be available for use, as follows:As at 31 December 2010 the non-euro area NCBs participating in 3 TARGET2 were    (Bulgarian National Bank), Danmarks Nationalbank, Eesti Pank, Latvijas Banka, Lietuvos bankas and Narodowy Bank Polski.Computers, related hardware 
and software, and motor vehicles 4 years Equipment, furniture and plant 
in building 10 years Fixed assets costing less than •10,000 Written off in the 
year of acquisition 220ECBAnnual Report
2010The length of the depreciation period for capitalised building and refurbishment 
expenditure relating to the ECB™s existing 
rented premises has been adjusted to ensure 
that these assets are fully depreciated before the 
ECB moves to its new premises. Costs incurred in relation to the ECB™s new premises are recorded under the heading 
ﬁAssets under constructionﬂ if they comply with 
the capitalisation criteria. These costs will be 
transferred to the relevant Þ xed asset headings 
once the assets are available for use. For the 
depreciation of the ECB™s new premises, costs 
will be assigned to the appropriate components 
and depreciated in accordance with the estimated 
useful lives of the assets.THE ECB’S RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER 

POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITSThe ECB operates a deÞ ned bene
Þ t plan for 
its staff. This is funded by assets held in a 
long-term employee beneÞ t fund.
On 1 June 2009 a new Pension Scheme for both 
existing staff and new entrants was introduced 
with a view to ensuring the plan™s long-term 
Þ nancial sustainability. Under this new scheme, the compulsory contributions of the ECB and 
the staff were increased from 16.5% to 18% and 
from 4.5% to 6% of basic salary respectively. 
As was the case in the past, staff can continue to 
make additional contributions under the new 
scheme on a voluntary basis in a deÞ ned contribution pillar that can be used to provide 
additional beneÞ ts. 4The previous Retirement Plan was frozen on 31 May 2009, and the related 
rights acquired by existing staff were preserved.BALANCE SHEETThe liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in 
respect of the deÞ ned beneÞ t plan is the present value of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation at the 
balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets used to fund the obligation, adjusted for 
unrecognised actuarial gains or losses. The deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation is calculated 
by discounting the estimated future cash ß ows using a rate which is determined by reference to 
market yields at the balance sheet date on high 
quality euro-denominated corporate bonds that 
have similar terms of maturity to the term of the 
pension obligation.Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience adjustments (where actual outcomes 
are different from the actuarial assumptions 
previously made) and changes in actuarial 
assumptions.PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNTThe net amount charged to the ProÞ t and Loss 
Account comprises: the current service cost of the de
Þ ned (a) beneÞ ts accruing for the year;
 interest at the discount rate on the de
Þ ned (b) beneÞ t obligation;
 the expected return on plan assets held 
(c) against the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation;
 any actuarial gains and losses arising from 
(d) post-employment beneÞ ts, using a ﬁ10% 
corridorﬂ approach; and any actuarial gains and losses arising from 
(e) other long-term beneÞ ts, in their entirety.
“10% CORRIDOR” APPROACHNet cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses on post-employment beneÞ ts which exceed the greater of (a) 10% of the The funds accumulated by a staff member through voluntary 4 contributions can be used at retirement to purchase an additional pension. This pension is included in the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation 
from that point on.221ECBAnnual Report
2010present value of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation 
and (b) 10% of the fair value of plan assets held against the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation, are 
amortised over the expected average remaining 
working lives of the participating employees.PENSIONS OF EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS AND 

OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS 
Unfunded arrangements are in place for the 
post-employment and other long-term beneÞ ts of members of the Executive Board of the ECB 
and for the disability beneÞ t provisions for staff. 
The expected costs of these beneÞ ts are accrued 
over the Executive Board/staff members™ terms 
of ofÞ ce/employment using an accounting 
approach similar to that of deÞ ned bene
Þ t pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in the manner outlined under ﬁProÞ t and Loss Accountﬂ above.These obligations are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the appropriate 
liability in the Þ nancial statements.
BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONThe ECB and the euro area NCBs, which 
together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro 
banknotes. 5 The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem 
central banks on the last working day of each 
month in accordance with the banknote 
allocation key. 6The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of 
the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, 
which is disclosed under the Balance Sheet 
liability item ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ. 
The ECB™s share of the total euro banknote 
issue is backed by claims on the NCBs. These 
claims, which bear interest, 7 are disclosed under the sub-item ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claims: claims 
related to the allocation of euro banknotes 
within the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra-ESCB 
balances/intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies). Interest income 
on these claims is included in the item ﬁNet 
interest incomeﬂ.INTERIM PROFIT DISTRIBUTIONThe ECB™s income on euro banknotes in 

circulation and income arising from securities 

purchased under the Securities Markets 

Programme is due to the euro area NCBs 

in the Þ nancial year in which it accrues. 
The ECB distributes this income in January 

of the following year by means of an interim 

proÞ t distribution. 
8 It is distributed in full 
unless the ECB™s net proÞ t for the year is less 
than its income earned on euro banknotes in 

circulation and securities purchased under the 

Securities Markets Programme, and subject to 

any decisions by the Governing Council to make 

transfers to the provision for foreign exchange 

rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks. 

The Governing Council may also decide to charge 

costs incurred by the ECB in connection with the 

issue and handling of euro banknotes against 

income earned on euro banknotes in circulation.OTHER ISSUESTaking account of the ECB™s role as a central 
bank, the Executive Board considers that the 
publication of a cash ß ow statement would not 
provide the readers of the Þ nancial statements 
with any additional relevant information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB, and on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Governing Council, 
the EU Council has approved the appointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the external 
auditors of the ECB for a Þ ve-year period up to 
the end of the Þ nancial year 2012.

20101 GOLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLES 
As at 31 December 2010 the ECB held 
16,122,143 ounces 9 of Þ ne gold (2009: 
16,122,146 ounces). This slight reduction was due 

to weight differences arising under a substitution 

programme that the ECB initiated in 2010. 

The euro equivalent value of this holding increased 

due to a signiÞ cant rise in the price of gold during 
2010 (see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and 

liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).2 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO 
AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN 

CURRENCY2.1 RECEIVABLES FROM THE IMF 
This asset represents the ECB™s holdings of special 

drawing rights (SDRs) as at 31 December 2010. 

It arises as the result of a two-way SDR buying 

and selling arrangement with the International 

Monetary Fund (IMF), whereby the IMF is 

authorised to arrange sales or purchases of 

SDRs against euro, on behalf of the ECB, 

within minimum and maximum holding levels. 

For accounting purposes, SDRs are treated 

as a foreign currency (see ﬁGold and foreign 

currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies).

1,032,964,073The increase in the euro value of these positions in 2010 was mainly due to the appreciation of 
the US dollar and the Japanese yen against the 
euro. Income received in 2010, primarily on 
the US dollar portfolio, also contributed to the 
increase in the total value of these items. The ECB™s net foreign currency holdings of US dollars and Japanese yen,10 as at 31 December  2010, were as follows: Currency in millionsUS dollars43,952

DENOMINATED IN EURO 
3.1 BALANCES WITH BANKS, SECURITY 
INVESTMENTS AND LOANSAs at 31 December 2010 this item consisted of a claim on a non-euro area central bank in 
connection with an agreement on repurchase 
transactions established with the ECB. Under 
this agreement the non-euro area central bank 
can borrow euro against eligible collateral in 
order to support its domestic liquidity-providing 
operations. 4 OTHER CLAIMS ON EURO AREA CREDIT 
INSTITUTIONS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
As at 31 December 2010 this item consisted 
mainly of an outstanding reverse repurchase 
transaction, conducted in the context of 
covered bond lending operations (see note 9,
 ﬁOther liabilities to euro area credit institutions 
denominated in euroﬂ).5 SECURITIES OF EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO5.1 SECURITIES HELD FOR MONETARY POLICY 
PURPOSESAs at 31 December 2009 this item consisted 
of securities acquired by the ECB within the 
scope of the covered bond purchase programme. 
Under this programme, the ECB and the NCBs 
purchased euro-denominated covered bonds 
issued in the euro area. The purchases under this 
programme were fully implemented by the end 
of June 2010.In May 2010 the Governing Council established 

the Securities Markets Programme. Under this 

programme, the ECB and the NCBs may purchase 

euro area public and private debt securities in order 

to address the malfunctioning of certain segments 

of the euro area debt securities markets and to 

restore the proper functioning of the monetary 

policy transmission mechanism. 
The ECB™s holdings of securities purchased under both programmes at the end of 2010 were 
as follows:2010 • 2009 • Change •Covered bond

The Governing Council decided to classify the 
securities purchased under both programmes as 

held-to-maturity securities (see ﬁSecuritiesﬂ in the 

notes on accounting policies). As a result of the 

impairment tests conducted as at 31 December 2010, 

no impairments were recorded for these securities.6 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM CLAIMS 
6.1 CLAIMS RELATED TO THE ALLOCATION OF 
EURO BANKNOTES WITHIN THE EUROSYSTEM 
This item consists of the claims of the ECB vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs relating to 
the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in 
the notes on accounting policies).224ECBAnnual Report
20107 OTHER ASSETS
7.1 TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
These assets comprised the following items on 31 December 2010:The increase in the category ﬁAssets under constructionﬂ is due mainly to activities related 
to the ECB™s new premises.In 2009 assets with a cost of •2.3 million were included in the category ﬁOther Þ xed assetsﬂ. 
In 2010 they were reclassiÞ ed under the heading 
ﬁAssets under constructionﬂ to reß ect their 
current status. The comparative balance for 
2009 has been adjusted accordingly. 7.2 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS
This item consists of the investment of the 
ECB™s own funds 11 held as a direct counterpart to the capital and reserves of the ECB, as well as 
other Þ nancial assets which include 3,211 shares 
in the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) 
at the acquisition cost of •41.8 million. The main components of this item are 
as follows:The net increase in this item was due mainly to the investment in the own funds portfolio of 
amounts received from the NCBs as a result of 
the increase in the ECB™s capital (see note 17, 
ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ) and income received 
in 2010.7.3 OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS 
REVALUATION DIFFERENCES 
This item is composed mainly of valuation 
changes in swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2010 (see note 23, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These valuation changes are the result of the 
conversion of such transactions into their euro 
equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing on 
the balance sheet date, compared with the euro 
values resulting from the conversion of the 
transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency on that date (see ﬁOff-balance-
sheet instrumentsﬂ and ﬁGold and foreign 
currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). Valuation gains on outstanding interest rate swap transactions are also included in this item 
(see note 21, ﬁInterest rate swapsﬂ). Repurchase agreements conducted in the context of the 11 management of the own funds portfolio are reported under ﬁSundryﬂ on the liabilities side (see note 14.3, ﬁSundryﬂ).2010• 2009• Change• Cost Land and buildings168,714,234168,811,800(97,566)

20107.4 ACCRUALS AND PREPAID EXPENSES
In 2010 this position included accrued interest receivable on the TARGET2 balances due 
from euro area NCBs for the Þ nal month 
of 2010, amounting to •364.7 million 
(2009: •261.6 million), and accrued interest 
receivable on the ECB™s claims related to 
the allocation of euro banknotes within 
the Eurosystem for the Þ nal quarter of the 
year (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies), amounting to 
•166.7 million (2009: •157.8 million).Also included in this item is accrued coupon interest on securities (see note 2.2, ﬁBalances 
with banks and security investments, external 
loans and other external assets; and Claims 
on euro area residents denominated in foreign 
currencyﬂ, note 5, ﬁSecurities of euro area 
residents denominated in euroﬂ, and note 7.2, 
ﬁOther Þ nancial assetsﬂ) as well as accrued 
interest on other Þ nancial assets.
7.5 SUNDRYThis item is composed mainly of positive 
balances related to swap and forward transactions 
in foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2010 (see note 23, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These balances arise from the conversion of 
such transactions into their euro equivalents at 
the respective currency™s average cost on the 
balance sheet date, compared with the euro 
values at which the transactions were initially 
recorded (see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ 
in the notes on accounting policies).A claim against the German Federal Ministry of Finance in respect of recoverable value added 
tax and other indirect taxes paid is also included 
under this heading. Such taxes are refundable 
under the terms of Article 3 of the Protocol on 
the privileges and immunities of the European 
Union, which applies to the ECB by virtue of 
Article 39 of the Statute of the ESCB. 8 BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION 
This item consists of the ECB™s share (8%) 
of the total euro banknotes in circulation 
(see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).9 OTHER LIABILITIES TO EURO AREA CREDIT 
INSTITUTIONS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
In 2010 the Governing Council decided that 
the euro area central banks would make 
available for lending bonds bought under the 
covered bond purchase programme. The ECB 
implemented these lending operations through 
matched repurchase transactions, whereby 
amounts received under repurchase agreements 

are fully and simultaneously reinvested with the 

same counterparty under a reverse repurchase 
agreement (see note 4, ﬁOther claims on euro 
area credit institutions denominated in euroﬂ). 
As at 31 December 2010 a repurchase agreement 

conducted in the context of the covered bond 
lending operations with a value of •33.4 million 

remained outstanding.10 LIABILITIES TO OTHER EURO AREA 
RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN EURO10.1 OTHER LIABILITIES
This item comprises deposits by members of 
the Euro Banking Association (EBA) which are 
used in order to provide the ECB with collateral 
in respect of the EBA™s payments settled through 
the TARGET2 system.11 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO 
As at 31 December 2010 these liabilities 
consisted mainly of balances held with the 
ECB by non-euro area NCBs arising from 
transactions processed via the TARGET2 system 226ECBAnnual Report
2010(see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).As at 31 December 2009 this item was composed mainly of a liability amounting to •4.5 billion 
arising from the temporary reciprocal currency 
arrangement with the Federal Reserve. Under 
this arrangement, US dollars were provided 
by the Federal Reserve to the ECB by means of 
a temporary swap line, with the aim of offering 
short-term US dollar funding to Eurosystem 
counterparties. The ECB simultaneously entered 
into back-to-back swap transactions with euro 
area NCBs, which used the resulting funds to 
conduct US dollar liquidity-providing operations 
with Eurosystem counterparties in the form of 
reverse and swap transactions. The back-to-back 
swap transactions resulted in intra-Eurosystem 
balances between the ECB and the NCBs. 
Given the improvements seen in the functioning 
of Þ nancial markets, the ECB con
Þ rmed in 
early 2010 the expiration of its temporary 
liquidity swap lines with the Federal Reserve 
on 1 February 2010. However, in response 
to the re-emergence of strains in US dollar 
short-term funding markets in Europe, the ECB 
and other central banks decided to re-establish 
the temporary US dollar liquidity swap facilities 
with the Federal Reserve on 10 May 2010. 
As a result of the reactivation of the US dollar 
liquidity-providing operations, a liability to the 
Federal Reserve, amounting to •57 million, 
was outstanding as at 31 December 2010.As at 31 December 2009 this item also included a liability to the Swiss National Bank 
amounting to •1.8 billion. Swiss francs were 
provided by the Swiss National Bank by means 
of a swap arrangement with the aim of offering 
short-term Swiss franc funding to Eurosystem 
counterparties. The ECB simultaneously entered 
into swap transactions with euro area NCBs, 
which used the resulting funds to conduct 
Swiss franc liquidity-providing operations 
with Eurosystem counterparties against euro 
cash in the form of swap transactions. The 
swap transactions between the ECB and the 
NCBs resulted in intra-Eurosystem balances. 
Against the background of declining demand and improved conditions in the funding 
markets, the ECB decided, in agreement with 
the Swiss National Bank, to stop conducting 
Swiss franc liquidity-providing operations after 

31 January 2010. Consequently, no related liability 

remained outstanding as at 31 December 2010.12 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY 
12.1 DEPOSITS, BALANCES AND OTHER LIABILITIES
This item consists of repurchase agreements 
conducted with non-euro area residents in 
connection with the management of the foreign 
currency reserves of the ECB.13 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM LIABILITIES 
13.1 LIABILITIES EQUIVALENT TO THE TRANSFER 
OF FOREIGN RESERVESThese represent the liabilities to the euro area NCBs that arose from the transfer of foreign 
reserve assets to the ECB when they joined the 
Eurosystem. No changes occurred in 2010. These balances are remunerated at the latest available marginal rate for the Eurosystem™s 
main reÞ nancing operations, adjusted to 
reß ect a zero return on the gold component 
(see note 26.3, ﬁRemuneration of NCBs™ claims 
in respect of foreign reserves transferredﬂ).

201013.2 OTHER CLAIMS/LIABILITIES WITHIN 
THE EUROSYSTEM (NET)In 2010 this item consisted mainly of the TARGET2 balances of the euro area NCBs 
vis-à-vis the ECB (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/
intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). The ECB had a net claim 
vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs at the end of 2009 
but a net liability at the end of 2010. This liability 
was due mainly to purchases of securities under 
the covered bond purchase programme and 
the Securities Markets Programme in 2010 
(see note 5, ﬁSecurities of euro area residents 
denominated in euroﬂ), which were settled via 
TARGET2 accounts. The reduction in the outstanding amount related to the back-to-back swap transactions 
conducted with NCBs in connection with US 
dollar liquidity-providing operations, as well 
as the discontinuation of Swiss franc liquidity-
providing operations (see note 11, ﬁLiabilities to 
non-euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ), 
also contributed to the decrease in the net claim 
and the creation of the net liability in 2010. In 2009 this item also included the amount due to euro area NCBs in respect of the interim 
distribution of the ECB™s income derived from 
banknotes in circulation. With respect to 2010, 
the Governing Council decided to retain the full 
amount of this income, as well as income earned 
on securities purchased under the Securities 
Markets Programme, and no related amounts 
were due at the end of 2010 (see ﬁInterim proÞ t distributionﬂ in the notes on accounting policies). 14 OTHER LIABILITIES
14.1 OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS 
REVALUATION DIFFERENCES 
This item is composed mainly of valuation changes in swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2010 (see note 23, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These valuation changes are the result of the 
conversion of such transactions into their euro 
equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing on 
the balance sheet date, compared with the euro 
values resulting from the conversion of the 
transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency on that date (see ﬁOff-balance-
sheet instrumentsﬂ and ﬁGold and foreign 
currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).Valuation losses on outstanding interest rate swaps are also included in this item 
(see note 21, ﬁInterest rate swapsﬂ).14.2 ACCRUALS AND INCOME COLLECTED IN ADVANCE 
As at 31 December 2010 the two main items 
under this heading were accruals on balances 
due to NCBs in respect of TARGET2, amounting

also reported in this item.Also included under this heading is a contribution 
to the ECB from the City of Frankfurt of 
•15.3 million for the preservation of the listed 
Grossmarkthalle building in connection with the 
construction of the ECB™s new premises. This 
amount will be netted against the cost of the 
building once it comes into use (see note 7.1, 
ﬁTangible and intangible Þ xed assetsﬂ). 
14.3 SUNDRYThis item includes negative balances related to 
swap and forward transactions in foreign currency 
that were outstanding on 31 December 2010 
(see note 23, ﬁForeign exchange swap and 
forward transactionsﬂ). These balances arise 
from the conversion of such transactions 
into their euro equivalents at the respective 
currency™s average cost on the balance sheet 
date, compared with the euro values at which 
the transactions were initially recorded 
(see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies).This item also includes outstanding repurchase transactions of •235.4 million 
(2009: •146.6 million) conducted in connection 

with the management of the ECB™s own funds 

(see note 7.2, ﬁOther Þ nancial assetsﬂ) and the 
net liability in respect of the ECB™s pension 
obligations as described below. THE ECB’S RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER 

POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
The amounts recognised in the Balance Sheet 
in respect of the ECB™s pension obligations 
(see ﬁThe ECB™s retirement plan and other post-employment beneÞ tsﬂ in the notes on

2010Up to 2009 actuarial gains and losses on other long-term beneÞ ts (i.e. disability and 
death beneÞ ts) were recorded in the Pro
Þ t and 
Loss Account in line with the ﬁ10% corridorﬂ 
approach. In 2010, owing to a change in 
methodology, these amounts were recognised 
in the ProÞ t and Loss Account in their entirety. 
Outstanding amounts in 2009 were not material 
and no restatement was considered necessary.Changes in the present value of the obligation are as follows:Changes in the fair value of plan assets, including those arising from voluntary contributions paid 
by plan participants, are as follows:The actuarial losses for 2009 on the deÞ ned beneÞ t obligation amounted to •97.0 million. 
This amount includes the effects of (a) the decrease in the discount rate from 5.75% to 5.50% that resulted in an increase in the liability 
value; (b) greater than expected growth in the 
value of the guaranteed beneÞ ts; and (c) the 
explicit inclusion of the obligation arising in 
connection with dependents™ beneÞ ts. Prior 
to 2009 the (net) liability for dependents™ 
beneÞ ts was assumed to be immaterial and was 
thus not explicitly included. However, as this 
liability has grown, it was decided to formally 
include it in the calculation of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation. Similarly, the explicit inclusion 
of the corresponding assets in the actuarial 
valuation resulted in actuarial gains on plan assets amounting to •42.1 million, out of the 
total actuarial gains of •65.7 million for 2009.The actuarial losses of •46.3 million arising on the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation in 2010 were 
primarily due to the decrease in the discount 
rate from 5.50% to 5.00% and an increase in the 
value of the guaranteed beneÞ ts. These factors 
were only partially offset by the reduction of the 
assumed future increase in pensions from 2.00% 
to 1.65%.As a result of the application of the annual Capital Guarantee on 31 December 2008, and given the loss of capital in the plan participants™ 
Core BeneÞ t Accounts, the Governing Council, 
acting on actuarial advice and in line with 
the rules of the ECB™s Retirement Plan, decided 
in 2009 to make a supplementary contribution 
of approximately •19.9 million out of the 
general assets of the ECB. This contribution 
resulted in an increase in the contributions 
paid by the ECB in 2009, compared with the 
respective Þ gure for 2010.
In 2009 amounts paid out of, as well as transfers 

into and out of, funds arising from the voluntary 

contributions of plan participants were 
included under ﬁOther net changes in assets

In 2010 these items were included for

230ECBAnnual Report
2010In preparing the valuations referred to in this note, the actuaries have used assumptions 
which the Executive Board has accepted for 
the purposes of accounting and disclosure. 
The principal assumptions used for the purposes 
of calculating the staff beneÞ ts scheme liability 
are as follows: 15 PROVISIONS 
This item consists of a provision for foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold 
price risks and other miscellaneous provisions. 
The latter include an appropriate provision for 
the contractual obligation of the ECB to restore 
its current premises to their original condition 
when they are vacated and the ECB moves to 
its new site.The Governing Council, taking into account the ECB™s large exposure to foreign exchange rate, 
interest rate and gold price risks, and the size of 
its revaluation accounts, deemed it appropriate 
to establish a provision as at 31 December 2005 
for these risks. In 2009, following the 
establishment of the covered bond purchase 
programme (see note 5, ﬁSecurities of euro area 
residents denominated in euroﬂ), the Governing 
Council decided to extend the scope of the risk 
provision to also cover credit risk. This provision 
will be used to the extent deemed necessary by 
the Governing Council to offset future realised 
and unrealised losses, in particular valuation 
losses not covered by the revaluation accounts. 
The size of and continuing requirement for 
this provision is reviewed annually, based on 
the ECB™s assessment of its exposure to the 
above risks. This assessment takes a range of 
factors into account, including in particular 
the level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent of materialised risk exposures in the 
current Þ nancial year, projected results for the 
coming year, and a risk assessment involving 
calculations of Values at Risk (VaR) on 
risk-bearing assets, which is applied consistently 
over time.12 The provision, together with any amount held in the general reserve fund, may 
not exceed the value of the ECB™s capital paid 
up by the euro area NCBs. As at 31 December 2009 the provision for the above risks amounted to •4,020,445,722. Taking 
the results of its assessment into account, 
the Governing Council decided to transfer, as at 

31 December 2010, an amount of •1,163,191,667 
to the provision out of income arising from 
securities purchased under the Securities 
Markets Programme (see note 26.4, ﬁOther 
interest income; and Other interest expenseﬂ), 
income on euro banknotes in circulation 
(see note 26.2, ﬁInterest income arising from the 
allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystemﬂ) and other net income earned in 
2010. This transfer reduced the ECB™s net proÞ t for 2010 to •170,831,395 and increased the size 
of the provision to •5,183,637,388, which, 
following the increase in the ECB™s capital 
(see note 17, ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ), equates to 
the value of the ECB™s capital paid up by the 
euro area NCBs as at 31 December 2010.13 16 REVALUATION ACCOUNTS 
These accounts represent revaluation balances 
arising from unrealised gains on assets and 
liabilities. See also Chapter 2 of the Annual Report. 12 The size of the risk provision as at 31 December 2009 and 13 31 December 2010, as well as the transfer to the risk provision in 2010, are presented rounded to the nearest euro. 2010 % 2009 % Discount rate 5.005.50

17.1 CAPITAL 
Pursuant to Article 28.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, as well as Council Regulation (EC) 
No 1009/2000 of 8 May 2000, the Governing 
Council decided to increase the subscribed 
capital of the ECB by •5 billion, from 
•5,760,652,403 to •10,760,652,403, with effect 
from 29 December 2010.14Pursuant to Article 28.3 of the Statute of the 

ESCB, the Governing Council decided that 

the euro area NCBs would pay their additional 

capital contributions of •3,489,575,000 in 

three equal annual instalments.15 Consequently, on 29 December 2010 the NCBs of the euro area 

(in its composition as at that date) paid 

an amount of •1,163,191,667 as their Þ rst 
instalment. The remaining two instalments 
shall be paid at the end of 2011 and 2012 

respectively. 
In addition, the Governing Council decided to reduce the percentage of the subscribed capital, 
which the non-euro area NCBs are required to 
pay as a contribution to the operational costs of 
the ECB, from 7.00% to 3.75%.16 Consequently, on 29 December 2010 the non-euro area NCBs 
paid up an amount of •84,220, which represents 
the difference between their contribution of 
3.75% on the increased capital and the amount 
paid up before the capital increase.There was no change in the ECB™s capital key as a result of the capital increase. The combined effect of the above decisions was an increase in the paid-up capital of the ECB 
amounting to •1,163,275,887, as shown in the 
table below:17Decision ECB/2010/26 of 13 December 2010 on the increase of 14 the European Central Bank™s capital, OJ L 11, 15.1.2011, p. 53.Decision ECB/2010/27 of 13 December 2010 on the paying-up 15 of the increase of the European Central Bank™s capital by the

18.1 ENTRY OF ESTONIA INTO THE EURO AREA
Pursuant to Council Decision 2010/416/EU of 13 July 2010, taken in accordance with 
Article 140(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning 
of the European Union, Estonia adopted the 
single currency on 1 January 2011. In accordance 
with Article 48.1 of the Statute of the ESCB and 
the legal acts adopted by the Governing Council 
on 13 and 31 December 2010,18 Eesti Pank paid up an amount of •12,572,592 as at 1 January 
2011 in respect of its capital subscription to the 
ECB. This amount takes account of the increase 
in the ECB™s capital with effect from 
29 December 2010, with due consideration of 
the extent to which the additional capital is 
paid-up (see note 17, ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ). In accordance with Article 48.1, in conjunction 
with Article 30.1, of the Statute of the ESCB, 
Eesti Pank transferred foreign reserve assets 
with a total value equivalent to •145,853,597 to 
the ECB with effect from 1 January 2011. 
These foreign reserve assets comprised amounts 

of Japanese yen in the form of cash, and gold, 
in proportions of 85 to 15 respectively. Eesti Pank was credited with claims in respect of the paid-up capital and foreign reserve assets 
equivalent to the amounts transferred. The latter 
is to be treated in an identical manner to the 
existing claims of the other euro area NCBs 
(see note 13.1, ﬁLiabilities equivalent to the 
transfer of foreign reservesﬂ).Decision ECB/2010/26 of 13 December 2010 on the increase 18 of the European Central Bank™s capital, OJ L 11, 15.1.2011, p. 53; Decision ECB/2010/34 of 31 December 2010 on the

18 February 2002, as last amended by Council 
Regulation (EC) No 431/2009 of 18 May 2009, 
the ECB continues to be responsible for the 
administration of the borrowing and lending 
operations of the EU under the medium-term 
Þ nancial assistance mechanism. Under this 
scheme, loans from the EU to Latvia, Hungary 
and Romania for a total amount of •12.1 billion 
were outstanding as at 31 December 2010.In the context of the loan facility agreement between the Member States whose currency is the euro 19 and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau,20 as lenders, the Hellenic Republic, as the

Articles 17 and 21.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
as well as Article 2 of Decision ECB/2010/4,21 the ECB is responsible for processing all related 
payments on behalf of the lenders and the 
borrower. Under this scheme, pooled bilateral 
loans for the beneÞ t of the Hellenic Republic 
amounting to •21 billion were outstanding as at 
31 December 2010.25 PENDING LAWSUITS 
An action for damages was brought against the 
ECB before the Court of First Instance of the 
European Communities (CFI) 22 by Document Security Systems Inc. (DSSI), alleging that the 
ECB had infringed a DSSI patent 23 in the production of euro banknotes. The CFI 
dismissed DSSI™s action for damages against 
the ECB.24 The ECB is currently pursuing actions to revoke the patent in certain national 
jurisdictions and has already succeeded in 
revoking it in a number of jurisdictions. 
Furthermore, the ECB Þ rmly maintains that it 
has in no way infringed the patent, and will 
consequently also enter a defence against any 
infringement action brought by DSSI before any 
competent national court.Other than the Hellenic Republic and the Federal Republic of 19 Germany.Acting in the public interest, subject to the instructions of and with 20 the beneÞ t of the guarantee of the Federal Republic of Germany.

2010NOTES ON THE PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT26 NET INTEREST INCOME
26.1 INTEREST INCOME ON FOREIGN 
RESERVE ASSETSThis item includes interest income, net of interest expense, in respect of the ECB™s net 
foreign reserve assets, as follows: The overall decrease in net interest income in 2010 was due mainly to lower net interest 
income generated on the US dollar portfolio.26.2 INTEREST INCOME ARISING FROM THE 
ALLOCATION OF EURO BANKNOTES 

WITHIN THE EUROSYSTEM 
This item consists of the interest income relating 
to the ECB™s share of the total euro banknote 
issue (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes 
on accounting policies). Interest on the claims 
of the ECB in respect of its share of banknotes 
is earned at the latest available marginal rate for 
the Eurosystem™s main reÞ nancing operations. 
The decrease in income in 2010 mainly reß ected the fact that the average main reÞ nancing rate 
was lower than in 2009. 26.3 REMUNERATION OF NCBS’ CLAIMS 
IN RESPECT OF FOREIGN RESERVES 

TRANSFERRED 
Remuneration paid to euro area NCBs on their 

claims on the ECB in respect of the foreign reserve 

assets transferred under Article 30.1 of the Statute 

of the ESCB is disclosed under this heading.26.4 OTHER INTEREST INCOME; AND OTHER 
INTEREST EXPENSEThese items include interest income of 
•3.8 billion (2009: •4.0 billion) and expenses

arising from TARGET2 (see note 13.2 ﬁOther 
claims/liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ, 
and note 11 ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area 
residents denominated in euroﬂ).These items also include net income of 
•140.4 million and •438.0 million on the securities 

purchased by the ECB under the covered bond

2010In 2010 this item included net realised price gains on sales of securities and net exchange 
rate gains on foreign currency outß ows. In 2009 net realised exchange rate and gold 
price gains arose, mainly owing to the sale of 
1,141,248 ounces of Þ ne gold in accordance 
with the Central Bank Gold Agreement. In 2010 
no such sales took place. 28 WRITE-DOWNS ON FINANCIAL ASSETS AND 
POSITIONS 
In 2010 this expense was due mainly to the 
write-down of the acquisition cost of a number 
of securities shown on the Balance Sheet to their 
market value as at 30 December 2010.29 NET EXPENSE FROM FEES AND COMMISSIONS 
In 2010 income under this heading consisted 
of penalties imposed on credit institutions for 
non-compliance with the minimum reserve 
requirements. Expenses relate to fees payable 
on current accounts and in connection with 
interest rate futures transactions (see note 20, 
ﬁInterest rate futuresﬂ).30 INCOME FROM EQUITY SHARES AND 
PARTICIPATING INTERESTS 
Dividends received on shares which the ECB 
holds in the BIS (see note 7.2, ﬁOther Þ nancial assetsﬂ) are shown under this heading. 31 OTHER INCOME 
Other miscellaneous income during the year 
arose mainly from the accrued contributions 
of the euro area NCBs to the costs incurred by 
the ECB in connection with a major market 
infrastructure project.32 STAFF COSTS 
Salaries, allowances, staff insurance and 
other miscellaneous costs of •167.7 million 
(2009: •158.6 million) are included under 
this heading. Also included in this item is an 
amount of •28.8 million (2009: •28.7 million) 
recognised in connection with the ECB™s 
retirement plan and other post-employment 
beneÞ ts (see note 14.3, ﬁSundryﬂ). Staff costs 
of •1.3 million (2009: •1.2 million) incurred in 
connection with the construction of the ECB™s 
new premises have been capitalised and are 
excluded from this item. Salaries and allowances, including the emoluments of holders of senior management 
positions, are modelled in essence on, and are 
comparable with, the remuneration scheme of 
the European Union.Members of the Executive Board receive a basic salary and additional allowances for residence 
and representation. In the case of the President, 
an ofÞ cial residence owned by the ECB is 
provided in lieu of a residence allowance.

goods and equipment of a non-capital nature, 
professional fees and other services and supplies, 
together with staff-related expenses including 
recruitment, relocation, installation, training and 
resettlement expenses.34 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION SERVICES 
This expense is mainly due to the cross-border 
transportation of euro banknotes between banknote
printing works and NCBs, for the delivery of 
new banknotes, and between NCBs, for the 
compensation of shortages with surplus stocks. 
These costs are borne centrally by the ECB.Staff on unpaid leave are excluded. This number includes staff 25 with permanent, Þ xed or short-term contracts and the participants

2010This note is not part of the Þ nancial statements 
of the ECB for the year 2010.INCOME RELATED TO THE ECB’S SHARE OF TOTAL 
BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION AND ITS HOLDINGS 

OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER THE 

EUROSYSTEM’S SECURITIES MARKETS PROGRAMMEIn respect of 2009 the full income earned 
on the ECB™s share of total euro banknotes 
in circulation, amounting to •787 million, 
was distributed to the euro area NCBs on 
5 January 2010, in proportion to their paid-up 
shares in the subscribed capital of the ECB. 
In respect of 2010, following a decision by the 
Governing Council, the full income earned on 
the ECB™s share of euro banknotes in circulation 
and securities purchased under the Securities 
Markets Programme, amounting to •654 million 
and •438 million respectively, was transferred to 
the provision for foreign exchange rate, interest 
rate, credit and gold price risks and therefore no 
interim proÞ t distribution took place.
PROFIT DISTRIBUTION/COVERAGE OF LOSSESPursuant to Article 33 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the net proÞ t of the ECB shall be transferred in 
the following order:an amount to be determined by the Governing (a) Council, which may not exceed 20% of the

reserve fund subject to a limit equal to 100% 
of the capital; and the remaining net proÞ t shall be distributed 
(b) to the shareholders of the ECB in proportion to their paid-up shares.In the event of a loss incurred by the ECB, the 
shortfall may be offset against the general 
reserve fund of the ECB and, if necessary, 
following a decision by the Governing Council, 
against the monetary income of the relevant 
Þ nancial year in proportion and up to the 
amounts allocated to the NCBs in accordance 
with Article 32.5 of the Statute of the ESCB.1The Governing Council decided on 
3 March 2011 to make no transfer to the general 
reserve fund and to distribute the proÞ t for 2010, 
amounting to •171 million, to the euro area 
NCBs, in proportion to their paid-up shares.Non-euro area NCBs are not entitled to receive any share of the ECB™s proÞ t, nor are they liable

ECB ANNOUNCES DETAILS OF REFINANCING 
OPERATIONS WITH SETTLEMENT 

UP TO 12 OCTOBER 2010In view of economic and Þ nancial market 
developments, the Governing Council of the 
ECB decided to continue the gradual phasing-
out of its non-standard operational measures.SpeciÞ cally, the Governing Council decided 
to continue conducting its main reÞ nancing operations (MROs) as Þ xed rate tender 
procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of 
this year™s ninth maintenance period on 
12 October 2010. This tender procedure 
will also remain in use for the Eurosystem™s 
special-term reÞ nancing operations with a 
maturity of one maintenance period, which 
will continue to be conducted for as long as 
needed and at least until the ninth maintenance 
period of 2010. The Þ xed rate in these 
special-term reÞ nancing operations will be the 
same as the rate used in the respective MRO.The Governing Council also decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the regular 
three-month longer-term reÞ nancing operations 
(LTROs), starting with the operation to be 
allotted on 28 April 2010. Allotment amounts 
in these operations will be set with the aim of 
ensuring smooth conditions in money markets 
and avoiding any signiÞ cant spreads between bid 
rates and the prevailing MRO rate. An indicative 
allotment amount will be pre-announced for 
each of the three-month LTROs at the start of the 
maintenance period in which the operation is to 
be conducted. The MRO rate will be used as the 
minimum bid rate in the three-month LTROs. 
This is a technical and transitional measure to 
avoid allotment rates below the prevailing MRO 
rate in the presence of ample liquidity.In order to smooth out the liquidity effect of the 12-month LTRO maturing on 1 July 2010, 
the Governing Council decided to carry out an 
additional six-day Þ ne-tuning operation with 
announcement, allotment and settlement on 1 July and maturity on 7 July, the latter date 
coinciding with the settlement day of the next 
MRO. The Þ xed rate tender procedure with full 
allotment will be used also in this operation, 
the Þ xed rate being the same as the prevailing 
MRO rate.Furthermore, the Governing Council also decided, in line with its decision on the 
12-month LTRO of 16 December 2009, to Þ x the rate in the six-month LTRO to be allotted on 
31 March 2010 at the average minimum bid rate 
of the MROs over the life of this operation.10 MAY 2010ECB ANNOUNCES MEASURES TO ADDRESS SEVERE 
TENSIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETSThe Governing Council decided on several 
measures to address the severe tensions in 
certain market segments which are hampering 
the monetary policy transmission mechanism 
and thereby the effective conduct of monetary 
policy oriented towards price stability in the 
medium term. The measures will not affect the 
stance of monetary policy.In view of the current exceptional circumstances prevailing in the market, the Governing Council 
decided:To conduct interventions in the euro 1. area public and private debt securities 
markets (Securities Markets Programme) 
to ensure depth and liquidity in those 
market segments which are dysfunctional. 
The objective of this programme is to 
address the malfunctioning of securities 
markets and restore an appropriate monetary 
policy transmission mechanism. The scope 
of the interventions will be determined 
by the Governing Council. In making this 
decision, note was taken of the statement OVERVIEW OF THE ECB’S COMMUNICATION 
RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY1PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY IN EURO 
Dates refer to the date of publication of the announcement. For 1 more details on the liquidity-providing operations conducted by the Eurosystem in 2010, see the ﬁOpen market operationsﬂ

Þ scal targets this year and the years ahead 
in line with excessive deÞ cit proceduresﬂ
 and of the precise additional commitments 
taken by some euro area governments to 
accelerate Þ scal consolidation and ensure 
the sustainability of their public Þ nances. In order to sterilise the impact of the above 
interventions, speciÞ c operations will be 
conducted to reabsorb the liquidity injected 
through the Securities Markets Programme.

2010PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY IN OTHER CURRENCIES 
AND AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS18 JANUARY 2010ECB DISCONTINUES THE SWISS FRANC 
LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONSThe Governing Council decided, in agreement 
with the Swiss National Bank, to stop conducting 
one-week Swiss franc liquidity-providing swap 
operations after 31 January 2010. This decision 
was made against the background of declining 
demand and improved conditions in the funding 
markets.27 JANUARY 2010ECB AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS DECIDE 
TO DISCONTINUE THE TEMPORARY SWAP LINES 

WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVEIn coordination with other central banks, 
the ECB conÞ rmed the expiration of its 
temporary liquidity swap lines with the Federal 
Reserve on 1 February 2010. These lines, which 
were established to counter pressures in global 
funding markets, are no longer needed given 
the improvements seen in the functioning of 
Þ nancial markets over the past year. Central 
banks will continue to cooperate as needed.In this context, the Governing Council decided, in agreement with the Federal Reserve, 
the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and 
the Swiss National Bank, to stop conducting 
US dollar liquidity-providing operations after 
31 January 2010.10 MAY 2010REACTIVATION OF US DOLLAR 
LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONSIn response to the re-emergence of strains in US 

dollar short-term funding markets in Europe, 

the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, 

the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve 

and the Swiss National Bank announced the 

re-establishment of temporary US dollar 
liquidity swap facilities. These facilities are 

designed to help improve liquidity conditions 

in US dollar funding markets and to prevent 

the spread of strains to other markets and other 

Þ nancial centres. The Bank of Japan will be 
considering similar measures soon. Central 

banks will continue to work together closely 

as needed to address pressures in funding 

markets.The Governing Council decided to reactivate, in coordination with other central banks, 
the temporary liquidity swap lines with 
the Federal Reserve, and resume US dollar 
liquidity-providing operations at terms of seven 
and 84 days. These operations will take the form 
of repurchase operations against ECB-eligible 
collateral and will be carried out as Þ xed rate 
tenders with full allotment. The Þ rst operation 
will be carried out on 11 May 2010.ECB ANNOUNCES DETAILS REGARDING 

THE REACTIVATION OF THE US DOLLAR

Council to reactivate the temporary swap line 
with the Federal Reserve, the ECB announced 
the operational details for its US dollar liquidity-
providing operations.The operations will be carried out as Þ xed rate 
tenders with full allotment and will take the form of repurchase operations against ECB-
eligible collateral.The ECB decided to conduct:Seven-day operations on a weekly basis. The  Œ
Þ rst operation will be held on 11 May 2010, with settlement on 12 May 2010 and maturity on 20 May 2010. Subsequent operations

LIQUIDITY-PROVIDING OPERATIONSThe Governing Council decided, in 
coordination with the Bank of Canada, the 
Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the 
Swiss National Bank, to extend the liquidity 
swap arrangements with the Federal Reserve up 
to 1 August 2011, and to continue to conduct 
US dollar liquidity-providing operations with 
a maturity of seven days. These Eurosystem 
operations will continue to take the form 
of repurchase operations against eligible 
collateral and will be carried out as Þ xed rate

detailed glossary can be found on the ECB™s website.
Balance of payments (b.o.p.): a statistical statement that summarises, for a speciÞ c period of time, 
the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The transactions considered are: those involving goods, services and income; those involving Þ nancial claims on, and liabilities to, the rest of the world; and those (such as debt forgiveness) that are classiÞ ed as transfers.
Bond market: the market in which longer-term debt securities are issued and traded.Candidate countries: countries for which the EU has accepted an application for EU membership. Currently, these are Croatia, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro 
and Turkey. Central counterparty (CCP): an entity that interposes itself, in one or more markets, between the counterparties to the contracts traded, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby guaranteeing the performance of open contracts.Central government: the government as deÞ ned in the European System of Accounts 1995, but excluding regional and local governments (see also general government).Central securities depository (CSD): an entity that: i) enables securities transactions to be processed and settled by book entry, ii) provides custodial services (e.g. the administration 
of corporate actions and redemptions), and iii) plays an active role in ensuring the integrity of 
securities issues. Securities can be held in a physical (but immobilised) form or in a dematerialised 
form (whereby they exist only as electronic records).Collateral: assets pledged or otherwise transferred (e.g. by credit institutions to central banks) as a guarantee for the repayment of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. by credit institutions to central 
banks) under repurchase agreements.Corporate governance: rules, procedures and processes according to which an organisation is directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure speciÞ es the distribution of rights and 
responsibilities among the different participants in the organisation Œ such as the board, managers, 
shareholders and other stakeholders Œ and lays down the rules and procedures for decision-making.Corporate proÞ tability: a measure of the earnings performance of corporations, mainly in relation to their sales, assets or equity. There are a number of different corporate proÞ tability ratios based on company Þ nancial statements, such as the ratio of operating income (sales minus 
operating expenses) to sales, the ratio of net income (operating and non-operating income, after 
tax, depreciation and extraordinary items) to sales, the return on assets (relating net income to total 
assets) and the return on equity (relating net income to shareholders™ funds). At the macroeconomic 
level, the gross operating surplus, based on the national accounts, for instance in relation to gross domestic product or value added, is often used as a measure of proÞ tability.Correspondent central banking model (CCBM): a mechanism established by the European System of Central Banks with the aim of enabling counterparties to use eligible collateral in a cross-border context. In the CCBM, NCBs act as custodians for one another. This means that each GLOSSARY267ECBAnnual Report

Þ nancial corporations (real):
 the cost incurred by non-Þ nancial corporations when taking up new external funds. For

ß ation expectations.Council of the European Union (Council): the institution of the EU made up of representatives of the governments of the EU Member States, normally the ministers responsible for the matters under consideration, and the relevant European Commissioner (see also ECOFIN Council).Counterparty: the opposite party in a Þ nancial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with a 
central bank).Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP): an ECB programme, based on the decision of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank of 7 May 2009 to purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area, in support of a speciÞ c Þ nancial market segment that

Such securities usually 
carry a speciÞ c rate of interest (the coupon) and/or are sold at a discount to the amount that will be repaid at maturity. Debt securities issued with an original maturity of more than one year are 
classiÞ ed as long-term.
Debt-to-GDP ratio (general government): the ratio of debt to gross domestic product at current market prices. It is the subject of one of the Þ scal criteria laid down in Article 126(2) of the 
Treaty to deÞ ne the existence of an excessive de
Þ cit.DeÞ cit (general government):
 the general government™s net borrowing, i.e. the difference between total government revenue and total government expenditure.268ECBAnnual Report
2010DeÞ cit-debt adjustment (general government): the difference between the general government budget balance (deÞ cit or surplus) and the change in debt.DeÞ cit ratio (general government):
 the ratio of the deÞ cit to gross domestic product at current market prices. It is the subject of one of the Þ scal criteria laid down in Article 126(2) of 
the Treaty to deÞ ne the existence of an excessive de
Þ cit (see also excessive deÞ cit procedure
). It is also referred to as the budget deÞ cit ratio or the 
Þ scal deÞ cit ratio.
Deposit facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use to make overnight deposits at an NCB. Such deposits are remunerated at a pre-speciÞ ed interest rate 
(see also key ECB interest rates).Direct investment: cross-border investment for the purpose of obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy (assumed, in practice, for ownership of at least 10% of the ordinary shares or voting power).

The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of current economic and Þ nancial developments and the implied short to medium-term risks to price 
stability from the perspective of the interplay between supply and demand in goods, services and 
factor markets at those horizons. Due attention is paid to the need to identify the nature of shocks 
affecting the economy, their effects on cost and pricing behaviour, and the short to medium-term 
prospects for their propagation in the economy (see also monetary analysis).Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a committee which contributes to the preparation of the work of the ECOFIN Council and the European Commission.

European Central Bank and the introduction of the euro. The cash changeover on 1 January 2002 completed the process of setting up EMU.Effective exchange rate (EER) of the euro (nominal/real): a weighted average of the bilateral euro exchange rates against the currencies of the euro area™s main trading partners. The European Central Bank publishes nominal EER indices for the euro against two groups of trading partners: the EER-20 (comprising the 10 non-euro area EU Member States and 10 trading partners outside 
the EU) and the EER-40 (composed of the EER-20 and 20 additional countries). The weights 
used reß ect the share of each partner country in the euro area™s trade in manufactured goods and 
account for competition in third markets. Real EERs are nominal EERs deß ated by a weighted 269ECBAnnual Report
2010average of foreign, relative to domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measures of price and cost competitiveness.EONIA (euro overnight index average): a measure of the effective interest rate prevailing in the euro 
interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest rates on unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by a panel of contributing banks.Equities: securities representing ownership of a stake in a corporation. They comprise shares traded on stock exchanges (quoted shares), unquoted shares and other forms of equity. Equities usually produce income in the form of dividends.Equity market: the market in which equities are issued and traded.ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II): the exchange rate mechanism which provides the framework for exchange rate policy cooperation between the euro area countries and the non-euro area EU Member States. ERM II is a multilateral arrangement with Þ xed, but adjustable, central rates and a standard ß uctuation band of ±15%. Decisions concerning central rates and, 
possibly, narrower ß uctuation bands are taken by mutual agreement between the EU Member State 
concerned, the euro area countries, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the other EU Member States participating in the mechanism. All participants in ERM II, including the ECB, have the right to initiate a conÞ dential procedure aimed at changing the central rates (realignment).

interbank deposits with different maturities of up to 12 months.Euro area: the area formed by the EU Member States whose currency is the euro and in which a single monetary policy is conducted under the responsibility of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. The euro area currently comprises Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, 
Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.Eurogroup: an informal gathering of the ministers of economics and Þ nance of the EU Member

 deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years, deposits redeemable at a period of notice of over three months, debt securities issued by euro area MFIs with an original maturity of more than two years, and the capital and reserves of the euro area MFI sector.MFIs (monetary Þ nancial institutions):
 Þ nancial institutions which together form the 
money-issuing sector of the euro area. These include the Eurosystem, resident credit institutions (as deÞ ned in EU law) and all other resident 
Þ nancial institutions whose business is to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for their own account (at least in economic terms), to grant credit and/or invest in securities. The latter group 
consists predominantly of money market funds, i.e. funds that invest in short-term and low-risk instruments, usually with a maturity of one year or less.Minimum bid rate: the lower limit to the interest rates at which counterparties may submit bids in the variable rate tenders.Monetary analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions. The monetary analysis helps to assess medium to long-term trends in inß ation, in view of the close relationship between money and prices over 
extended horizons. The monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of 
monetary indicators, including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures of excess liquidity (see also economic analysis).Monetary income: income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the Eurosystem™s monetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with guidelines established 
by the Governing Council and held against banknotes in circulation and deposit liabilities to credit institutions.274ECBAnnual Report
2010Money market: the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded, using instruments which generally have an original maturity of up to and including one year.Non-standard measures: measures taken by the ECB to support the effectiveness and transmission of interest rate decisions to the wider euro area economy in the context of a dysfunctional situation in some Þ nancial market segments and the 
Þ nancial system more broadly.OFIs (other Þ nancial intermediaries):
 corporations or quasi-corporations (other than insurance corporations or pension funds) that are engaged mainly in Þ nancial intermediation by incurring 
liabilities in forms other than currency, deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from institutional entities other than MFIs. OFIs include in particular corporations engaged primarily in long-term Þ nancing (such as Þ nancial leasing), securitised asset holdings, other Þ nancial holdings, securities and derivatives dealing (on their own account), venture capital and development capital.Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in the Þ nancial market. With regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, Eurosystem open market operations can be divided into four categories: main reÞ nancing operations
; longer-term reÞ nancing operations; Þ ne-tuning operations
; and structural operations. As for the instruments used, reverse transactions are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed in all four categories of operation. In addition, the issuance of debt certiÞ cates and outright transactions 
are available for structural operations, while outright transactions, foreign exchange swaps and the collection of Þ xed-term deposits are available for the conduct of 
Þ ne-tuning operations.Options: Þ nancial instruments that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
speciÞ c assets (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predetermined price (the strike or exercise price) on or up 
to a certain future date (the exercise or maturity date).Portfolio investment: euro area residents™ net transactions and/or positions in securities issued by non-residents of the euro area (ﬁassetsﬂ) and non-residents™ net transactions and/or positions 
in securities issued by euro area residents (ﬁliabilitiesﬂ). Included are equities and debt securities (bonds and notes, and money market instruments), excluding amounts recorded in direct investment or reserve assets.Price stability: the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem. The Governing Council deÞ nes price stability as a year-on-year increase in the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. The Governing Council has also made it clear that, in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inß ation rates below, but close to, 2% over 
the medium term.Projections: the results of exercises conducted four times a year to project possible future macroeconomic developments in the euro area. Eurosystem staff projections are published in June and December, whereas European Central Bank (ECB) staff projections are published in March and September. They form part of the economic analysis pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB and are thus one of several inputs into the Governing Council™s assessment of the risks to price stability.Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system: a settlement system in which processing and settlement take place on a transaction-by-transaction basis in real time (see also TARGET).275ECBAnnual Report
2010Reference value for M3 growth: the annual growth rate of M3 over the medium term that is consistent with the maintenance of price stability. At present, the reference value for annual M3 growth is 4½%.Repurchase agreement: the process of borrowing money by combining the sale of an asset (usually a Þ xed income security) with the subsequent repurchase of that same asset on a speci
Þ ed date for a slightly higher speciÞ ed price (which re
ß ects the borrowing rate).
Reserve base: the sum of the eligible balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) that constitute the basis for calculating the reserve requirement of a credit institution.Reserve requirement: the minimum amount of reserves a credit institution is required to hold with the Eurosystem over a predeÞ ned maintenance period. Compliance with the requirement is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balances in the reserve accounts over the maintenance period.Retained securitisation: a situation in which securities issued in the context of a securitisation transaction are bought back by the institution that originated the transaction (see also securitisation).Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.Securities Markets Programme (SMP): an ECB programme for conducting interventions in the euro area public and private debt securities markets to ensure depth and liquidity in dysfunctional market segments with a view to restoring an appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism.Securities settlement system (SSS): a system which allows the transfer of securities, either free of payment or against payment (delivery versus payment).Securitisation: the pooling of Þ nancial assets, such as residential mortgage loans, and their 
subsequent sale to a special-purpose vehicle, which then issues Þ xed income securities for sale to investors. The principal and interest of these securities depend on the cash ß ows produced by the 
pool of underlying Þ nancial assets.
Settlement risk: the risk that settlement in a transfer system will not take place as expected, usually owing to a party defaulting on one or more settlement obligations. This risk includes, in particular, 
operational risks, credit risks and liquidity risks.Stability and Growth Pact: intended to serve as a means of safeguarding sound government Þ nances in the EU Member States in order to strengthen the conditions for 
price stability and for strong, sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. To this end, the Pact prescribes that 
Member States specify medium-term budgetary objectives. It also contains concrete speciÞ cations on the excessive deÞ cit procedure
. The Pact consists of the Resolution of the Amsterdam European Council of 17 June 1997 on the Stability and Growth Pact and two Council Regulations, namely i) Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary 
positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies as amended by Regulation 
(EC) No 1055/2005 of 27 June 2005, and ii) Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on 
speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deÞ cit procedure as amended by 
276ECBAnnual Report
2010Regulation (EC) No 1056/2005 of 27 June 2005. The Stability and Growth Pact is complemented by the ECOFIN Council™s report entitled ﬁImproving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, which was endorsed by the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005. It 
is also complemented by a Code of Conduct entitled ﬁSpeciÞ cations on the implementation of the 
Stability and Growth Pact and Guidelines on the format and content of stability and convergence 
programmesﬂ, which was endorsed by the ECOFIN Council on 11 October 2005.Standing facility: a central bank credit facility available to counterparties at their own initiative. The Eurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility.Straight-through processing (STP): the automated end-to-end processing of trades/payment transfers Œ including, where relevant, the automated completion of conÞ rmation, matching and 
generation of orders, clearing and settlement.Systemic risk: the risk that the inability of one participant to meet its obligations in a system will cause other participants to be unable to meet their obligations when they become due, potentially with spillover effects (e.g. signiÞ cant liquidity or credit problems) threatening the stability of or 
conÞ dence in the 
Þ nancial system. That inability to meet obligations can be caused by operational 
or Þ nancial problems.
TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system): the Eurosystem™s real-time gross settlement system for the euro. The Þ rst-generation TARGET
 system was replaced by TARGET2 in May 2008.TARGET2: the second-generation TARGET system. It settles payments in euro in central bank money and functions on the basis of a single shared IT platform, to which all payment orders are 
submitted for processing.TARGET2-Securities (T2S): the Eurosystem™s single technical platform enabling central securities depositories and NCBs to provide core, borderless and neutral securities settlement services in central bank money in Europe.
