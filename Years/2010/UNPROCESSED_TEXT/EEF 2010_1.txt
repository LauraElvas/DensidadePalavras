KC-AR-10-007-EN-CThe European Commission publishes comprehensive macroeconomic forecasts twice-yearly in the spring and autumn. These are presented in the publication titled ‚European Economic Forecast™ (EEF), where the Commission discusses the economic situation and outlook for the euro area and the EU, its 27 Member States, the Candidate Countries as well as the EU™s main economic partners. The publication also includes thematic chapters which elaborate in greater detail on issues of relevance for the EU outlook.The autumn 2010 forecast foresees a continuation of the economic recovery currently underway in the EU. GDP is projected to grow by around 1¾% in 2010-11 (with a slight easing next year) and by some 2% in 2012. A better than expected performance so far this year underpins the signiÞ cant upward revision to annual growth in 2010 compared to the spring forecast. However, amid a softening 
global environment and the onset of Þ scal consolidation, activity is expected to moderate towards 
the end of the year and in 2011, but to pick up again in 2012 on the back of strengthening private demand. With the economic recovery taking hold in the EU, labour-market conditions are expected to slowly improve over the forecast horizon, as is the budgetary situation. The unemployment rate is projected to fall to around 9% in 2012, with the public deÞ cit declining to about 4¼% of GDP. The 
debt ratio is projected to continue increasing though. As for inß ation, prospects remain relatively 
subdued, with an average rate of around 2% expected over the forecast period. While the recovery 
is becoming increasingly self-sustaining at the aggregate level, developments across Member States remain uneven, more so than in the spring. The recovery is set to advance at a relatively fast pace in some countries, but to lag behind in others. This reß ects differences in the scale of adjustment 
challenges across economies and ongoing rebalancing within the EU and euro area.As Þ scal consolidation and structural reforms have important implications for the sustainability 
of public Þ nances and the growth dynamics of the EU economy going forward, the two thematic 
chapters presented in the EEF autumn 2010 publication focus on these issues.European Economic Forecast - Autumn 2010EUROPEAN ECONOMY 7|2010ISSN 0379-0991Price (excluding VAT) in Luxembourg: EUR 25European Economy (6 issues minimum per year): EUR 160The annual subscription runs from 1 January to 31 December of each year.Payments to be made only to sales agents on the list (see inside backcover for details).These are surface mail rates.

52 EDITORIAL vii 
The economic recovery in the European Union and th
e euro area is making progress. We see a welcome 
broadening of the basis for the recovery, with domestic demand coming to the fore, and the recovery 
increasingly becoming self-sustained. However, the growth
 spurt seen in particular in the second quarter 
of this year was exceptional and no
t likely to last. The overall pace of
 the recovery remains gradual and 
rather uneven across Member States.  
The shock of the global crisis still casts its shadow 
over the EU economy. As argued last year, it will take 
time therefore for our economies to work through the inevitable financial and economic adjustment, thus 

muting the prospects for employment, consumption and investment over the forecast horizon. However, 

the challenges and pace of adjustment differ across Member States. The German economy is leading the 

recovery. At the same time, growth
 is expected to remain subdued
 in those Member States where 
formidable adjustment challenges remain due to do
mestic macroeconomic and structural imbalances 
accumulated prior to the crisis.  
The level of uncertainty for our outlook continues to be very high. In particular, the risks to the global 
economic environment seem tilted to the downside. 
As the autumn 2010 European Economic Forecast 
(EEF) document is going to print, tensions in euro-area sovereign debt markets have re-emerged.  Indeed, 

a replay of the negative feedback loop between rising sovereign risk premia, banks' ability to lend and 

economic growth prospects cannot be excluded. It goes 
without saying that such a scenario, if it was to 
materialise, would throw a spanner in the wheels of 
the recovery. But is it likely? We do not think so. 
First of all, in contrast to the situation at the 
beginning of the year, with the European Financial 
Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Fi
nancial Stability Facility (EFSF) we now have the 
instruments in place to take emergency measures sh
ould they become necessa
ry. The recent decision to 
provide financial assistance to Ireland in the contex
t of an EU-IMF programme 
shows that the Union can 
move swiftly when risks for financial stability in the EU and the euro area set in. Second, the health of the 
European banking sector in autumn 2010 has recovered compared to a year ago. The capital ratios of 
banks have improved, money markets are showing signs of normalisation, and lending to the private 
sector has started to pick up. Third, important measures have been taken in Member States perceived as 
vulnerable to correct fiscal imbalances, foster economic adjustment and so improve the prospects for 
growth. And finally, the European economy is now more
 solidly on the path of recovery than was the 
case in Spring. 
Our autumn forecast highlights the importance of ma
king progress on a four-point policy programme to 
achieve fiscal sustainability, financial sector repa
ir and higher potential growth. First, determined 
implementation of fiscal adjustment is needed to put
 public finances back on sustainable footing. The 
thematic chapter on fiscal consolidation contained in this autumn's EEF shows that consolidation 
strategies can be designed as to minimise the inevitable short-term costs and maximise the longer-run 
gains on growth. Second, the banking sector needs further attention to strengthen its resilience to shocks 

where necessary and to ensure it is viable to meet
 increased credit demands 
and perform its allocation 
functions. Third, structural reform should be pursued with vigour to foster economic adjustment, 
revitalise economic growth in Europe and thereby help achieving fiscal consolidation. This is the focus of 
the second thematic chapte
r in this autumn forecast. And, finally
, the international community, including 
in particular the G20, must keep
 the cooperative process of multilateral policy coordination towards 
strong, balanced and sustainable global growth on track and protectionist tendencies contained.

OVERVIEW 1 The economic recovery in the EU, while still fragile and uneven across 
Member States, is proceeding at a somewh
at faster pace than anticipated in 
the spring. Real GDP has surprised on 
the upside so far this year and 
particularly in the second quarter, wh
en it picked up by an exceptional 1% 
(quarter-on-quarter) in both the EU
 and the euro area. This strong 
performance stemmed in large part from the ongoing export-driven industrial 
rebound, in line with the continued strong dynamics of global growth and 
trade in the first half of the year, 
most notably in emerging markets. 
Encouragingly, a revival in domestic demand, including private consumption 

and investment, also became evident, pa
rticularly in Germany. The spillover of some of this momentum into the second half of the year implies 
a significant upward revision to annual growth in 2010 compared to the 
spring forecast. 
Recovery gathered 
pace and broadened out in the first half of 
2010... 
Looking ahead, the pace of GDP growth in
 the EU is set to moderate into 
mid-2011, as the global economy goes through a temporary soft patch, 

dampening EU export growth. The p
ace of economic activity eased already 
in the third quarter, reflecting also th
e fading of the temporary factors that 
kick-started the recovery, such as the 
exceptional stimulus measures and the 
positive impulse from inventory adjustments that were particularly important 
in shaping short-run dynamics in the 
EU and globally in recent quarters. 
Another factor that is set to weigh on growth prospects in the short to 
medium term is the fiscal consolidati
on phase that many Member States are 
embarking on to put the fiscal situation onto a sustainable footing. 
...but is expected to 
moderate as the 
global economy goes 
thro
ugh a temporary 

soft patch and fiscal 
consolidation starts in 
the EU– 
On the side of financial markets, conditions in several segments have 
recovered somewhat from the acute te
nsions experienced last May. In 
particular, following decisive policy action, including the creation of the 

European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and the European Financial 

Stability Facility, and continued support provided by the monetary policy 
authorities stress in sovereign-bond markets has generally eased, though 
some tensions have reappeared lately. For the banking sector, the publication 
of EU-wide stress tests showed that the system as a whole is resilient, despite 
some pockets of vulnerability. Moreover, lending activity to the private 
sector appears to have turned positive in line with past patterns. As the 
economic recovery gains firmer ground and concerns about fiscal 
sustainability are addressed, financial-
market conditions should continue to 
gradually improve and provide support to the recovery. Yet, with balance-

sheet adjustments remaining incomplete in several sectors/countries and 

lingering concerns about developments in certain market segments, the 
situation remains generally tenuous and uncertainty is rife. 
...while financial 
markets gradually 
recover and provide 
support there is
 ... 
Notwithstanding the strong performance ear
lier this year, the EU recovery so 
far is more muted than the average of pr
evious upturns. This is in line with 
the pattern that has in the past charact
erised recoveries following financial 
crises. As argued since last autumn
, the EU faces significant legacy 
headwinds that are set to restrain domestic demand while the economy 
transits to a new steady state in 
the coming years. These include the 
downsizing of construction sectors, which is still ongoing in a number of 
Member States; the increase in unemployment, which following financial 
crises tends to be accompanied by higher structural unemployment; the surge 
in government deficits and debt, which,
 as seen recently, can threaten overall 
... sluggish (post-crisis) 
recovery ahead, as 
the EU grapples with 
legacy headwinds. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
financial stability; and the adverse impact of the financial crisis on potential 
output, which is estimated to remain well below pre-crisis levels over the 

forecast horizon. The two thematic chap
ters in this autumn forecast document 

provide a timely treatment of the latter two issues, with an assessment of the 

likely impact of fiscal consolidation 
on economic growth 
and an examination 
of how to restore the EU's growth potential. In keeping with the renewed 
emphasis on these two issues (e.g. via the Europe 2020 strategy), the chapters 
also consider how fiscal adjustment a
nd structural reforms can be used to 
underpin the sustainability of public finances and spur a more dynamic EU 
economy beyond the forecast horizon.. 
In terms of demand components, a broadening out of the recovery appears to 
be taking hold somewhat earlier than envisaged in the spring. The ongoing 

strength of export growth has brought forward the rebound of equipment 

investment, which is set to return to positive growth this year. The brighter 

prospects for equipment investment also reflect improved corporate profits 

and higher capacity utilisation rates. As for private consumption, the gradual 
strengthening has also been advanced, with a modest pick-up envisaged for 
this year. Further ahead, slowly improving labour markets, moderate income 
growth, subdued inflation and lower saving rates should underpin the gradual 
recovery of private consumption. However, the still ongoing deleveraging 
process in the corporate and household sectors, heightened risk aversion and 
the impact of fiscal consolidation are 
set to weigh on capital and consumer 
spending in the short term. 
A broadening out of 
the recove
ry is 
material
ising earlier 

than en
visaged in the 
spring– 
With private domestic demand gradually strengthening, the recovery is set to 
become increasingly self-sustaining ov
er the forecast horiz
on. Overall, EU 
GDP growth is expected to remain rather subdued over the next three 

quarters, and to regain ground from the second half of 2011, when external 

demand growth also picks-up, to reach a pace of some ½% quarter-on-quarter 

in 2012. Taking into account the significant upward revision to this year's 
growth and the above mentioned developments, annual GDP growth should 
ease somewhat next year, from about 1¾% in 2010 in both the EU and the 
euro area to about 1½% in the euro 
area and more marginally in the EU, 
before recovering to some 2% in 2012. This implies that the EU economy 

starts this year to slowly close the si
zeable output gap that opened up during 
the recession.  
...leading to GDP 
growth of about 1¾% 
in 2010, somewhat 
lower in 2011 and 
about 2% in
 2012 The aggregate picture masks marked 
differences in developments across 
Member States. Some countries, in 
particular Germany, but also some 
smaller export-oriented economies have registered a solid rebound in activity, 
while others, notably some peripheral countries are lagging behind. Factors 

explaining the divergences include trade orientation, the product mix of 
exportables, degree of openness, exposure to the financial-sector disturbances 
and the existence of sizeable internal 
and/or external imbalances. Looking 
forward, the expectation remains for a 
differentiated pace of recovery within 
the EU, reflecting the challenges individual economies face and the policies 
they pursue. Lingering concerns about fiscal sustainability, especially in 
some euro-area Member States that re
main under intense market scrutiny and 
differences in competitiveness positions appear among the most important 
challenges in this regard. 
Increasing differences 
across EU countries, 
particularly
 between 
core and periphery... 
Among the largest economies, the upturn is set to be notably strong in 
Germany, where economic activity is exp
ected to expand by 3.7% this year, 
more than double that of the euro area. Meanwhile France is just below the 
area average, Italy ½ pp. lower, and Spai
n is projected to remain in recession. 
...reflecting 
heterogeneity in 
individual challenges 
2 Overview 
Outside the euro area, the very strong 
German performance is nearly matched 
by Poland, the only EU economy to have
 escaped a recession last year, while 
the recovery in the United Kingdom is expected to match only the moderate 

EU average. Among the smaller economies, the rebound is particularly 

pronounced for Slovakia (4.1%) and 
Sweden (4.8%), the latter two posting 
the highest growth rates in the EU. In contrast, GDP is projected to contract 
in Greece, Latvia, Romania, 
and mildly in Bu
lgaria and Ireland. By 2011, all 
EU countries, with the exception of Gr
eece and Portugal, are expected to be 
out of recession. With the strong momentum in Germany pulling other 
countries, and a general gradual strengthening of domestic demand, GDP 
growth will tend to firm up in the course of 2011 and 2012 for most Member 
States. Labour-market conditions have starte
d to stabilise in recent months. The 
second quarter of 2010 saw job losses come to an end in the EU, while 
employment remained stable in the euro area (at 0% q-o-q). Similarly, the 

unemployment rate has more or less held steady since the spring, at 9.6% in 
the EU and at around 10% in the euro 
area. The situation is, however, highly 
differentiated across countries, with th
e rate of unemployment ranging from 
4-5% in the Netherlands and Austria to some 17-20% in Spain and the 
Baltics.  Labour market 
conditio
ns are 
stabilising, albeit with 
high unemployme
nt 
levels prevailing,... 
Looking ahead and taking into account the usual lag between output and 
employment growth, the outlook is for a gradual improvement in labour 

markets over the forecast horizon. Empl
oyment is now projected to contract 
by around ½% in the EU and ¾% in th
e euro area in 2010, some ¼ pp. less 

than envisaged in the spring, with modest growth expected thereafter in both 

regions. The outlook for unemployment is brighter than in the spring, also 
owing to the resilience shown in some Member States, with declines of some 
½ pp. expected over the forecast horizon
 in both regions. However, despite 
brightening since the spring, the outlook remains for a rather jobless recovery 
and (potentially persistent) high unempl
oyment ahead at the aggregate level.  
...and the outlook is for 
a gradual 
improvement though 
with a rather jo
bless 
recovery 
Consumer-price inflation has been on a moderate upward path so far this 
year, on the back of upward food and 
energy base effects, increasing global 

commodity prices and firming core inflation. Sizeable slack in the economy 
is nevertheless expected to keep both wage growth and inflation in check, 

partly offsetting expected increases in
 energy and commodity prices. HICP 
inflation is projected to average 2% in 
the EU both this year and next, before 
easing to about 1¾% in 2012
, and in the euro area to 
rise from 1½% this year 
to 1¾% in 2011-12.  
Economic slack keeps 
inflation in check 
After having been severely hit by the crisis, albeit to different degrees across 
countries, public finances are starting 
to adjust. About half of EU Member 
States are expected to post lower genera
l government deficits this year than 
in 2009. On account of stronger growth, the end of the temporary stimulus 

measures and the additional consolidatio
n efforts announced since the spring, 
the general government deficit in the EU
 (excluding Ireland where a one-off 
operation led to a deficit of some 32%) is
 expected to fall from about 6½% of 
GDP this year to around 5% in 2011 and 4¼% in 2012, with a broadly 
similar pattern but at a somewhat 
lower level for the euro area. The 
adjustment seems to be mainly expenditure-based in both regions. 
Public deficits start 
adjusting... 
The debt ratio, in contrast, remains on an increasing path over the forecast 
horizon, reaching some 83% of GDP in 
the EU and 88% in the euro area by 
2012. If not corrected in th
e years to come, the curren
t trends in public debt 
... while debt remains 
on an upward path

4 may jeopardise long-term fiscal sustainability given the combination of 
sustained large deficits, low(er) potential growth than in the past and, in the 
not too distant future, unfavourable demographic developments. 
Amid continued high uncertainty, the pr

As regards economic activity, the re
balancing of EU GDP growth towards 
domestic demand could prove stronger than
 assumed in the forecast with, for 
instance, the labour market surprising positively. Similarly, spillovers from 
the strong momentum in Germany to other Member States could materialise 
to a larger extent than currently expected. Moreover, policy measures to 

redress the fiscal situation could prove 
more effective than presently foreseen 
in dissipating market concerns (in both the EU and abroad) and thus further 
raising confidence among businesses and consumers. In contrast, a more 
pronounced slowdown in the global economy than included in the baseline is 
a risk to EU export growth. Related to this are risks from tensions in 
exchange rates and rekindled protectionist impulses. The fragility of financial 
markets, particularly of some sovereign-bond segments, remains a source of 

concern, with damaging negative feedback loops still possible. Finally, fiscal 

consolidation, given uncertainty on the timing of measures, may weigh more 
on domestic demand more than currently envisaged.

PART I Economic developments at the aggregated level 1. THE EU ECONOMY: A GRADUAL AND UNEVEN RECOVERY 7 The economic recovery in the EU appears tobe taking hold, with GDP growth surprising on the upside thus far in2010, both inmagnitude and composition. While activity is set to moderate towards the endof the year, the better than expected performance in the first half of 2010, and the spillover of some ofthis momentum into the second, imply a significant upward revision to annual growth compared to the spring forecast.  Further out, a number of forces are set to shape growthprospects. Whereas the projected softening ofthe global environment and fiscal consolidation are expected to have a dampening effect, especially nextyear, further improvements in financial-market conditions and the broadening out of the recovery are expected tosupport activityin2011 and 2012. Indeed, withprivate demandgraduallystrengtheningover the forecast horizon, the recovery is set to become increasingly self-sustaining. Developmentsacross Member States remain uneven however, more so than in the spring, with the recovery advancingat a relatively fast pace in some, but laggingbehind inothers. This reflects differences in the scale ofadjustment challenges across economies and ongoingrebalancing within the EUand euroarea. Overall, the EU economy is forecast togrow by around 1¾% in 2010-11 (with a slight easingnext year)and by some 2%in 2012. Risks to this outlook appear broadly balanced, though uncertainty remains high.  1.1. RECOVERY PROGRESSING Autumn 2009 saw a resurgence of economic growth in the EU, thus bringing to an end the deepest andlongest recession in the region's history. A year on and the economy appears to be on the mend;with the recoveryprogressing and evensurprising on the upside in2010 to date. Economic activity was especially strongin the second quarter, expanding by 1% or so (q-o-q) inthe EU and euro area. This solid performance followed largely from an export-led rebound in industry, in line with the dynamics of globalactivity and trade. However, reflecting a softening in the latter and the fading of the temporary factors that kick-started the recovery, the pace of growtheased in the third quarter (to around ½% q-o-q inboth regions). While the nascent recovery of last autumn hasgained some groundover the past year, thepick-upin economic activity has, on the whole, been rather modest. Indeed, apart from the initial rebound (which owed much to policy measures in the EU and abroad), this recovery is proving more muted than the average upturn (see graph I.1.1).(1) This is as expected, and in line with the characteristics of past recoveries following periods of financial(1)The previous recoveries referred to are those of the mid-1970s, early 1980s and early 1990s.distress.

The remaining sectionsof this chapter elaborate on the current situation andshort-term outlookfor the EU economy. (3)See chapter 1 in European Commission (2009) 'EuropeanEconomic Forecast Œ Autumn 2009'.Broadly favourable developments so far While the recovery this time round is set to bemore gradual and more subdued thanpastupturns,the chain of events should be much the same.Recoveries of the EU economy are typically export-led: witha pick-up in exports feedingthrough to (equipment) investment; investmentgrowth then leading to employment growthwhich,in turn, stimulates private consumption.(4)A year into the current recovery and available data show that export growthŒ the first stage of thetraditionalrecovery pattern Œ has been solidforsome time now. EU exports rose by a sizeable 4%q-o-q in the secondquarter of 2010, with euro-area exports also up by 4¼%. Moreover, there are signs that the economy is entering the next phase of the typical recovery sequence, whereby the pick-up inexports spurs (equipment) investment demand. Forinstance, the second quarter saw some rebalancingof GDP growth towards domestic demand, withthe broad-based nature of the latestsurvey(4)See chapter 1 in European Commission (2010) 'EuropeanEconomic Forecast Œ Spring 2010'.8 Economic developments at the aggregated levelreadings suggesting a similar outcome in the thirdquarter (see graphs I.1.2a-d).

However, a closer look at the data reveals marked cross-country differences. Excluding Germany, where recent developments have beenparticularly dynamic, the aggregate picture is moretentative.

LOOKING AHEAD Turning to the growth prospects for the EU economy over the forecast horizon, which now extends out to 2012. Given the important role played by global growthand credit in recoveriesfollowing financial crises, the startingpoint in this respect is the outlook for the external environment and financialmarkets.(5)Global recovery continues, though momentumsoftens – The solid export performance of the EU economyof late owes much to the strength of global activity and trade (excl. EU) in the first half of 2010. A softening in the paceof world growth ishowever in sight for the second half of the year, assupport from the inventory cycle and stimulus measures wanes. High-frequencyindicatorssuggest that this soft patch has already started tomaterialise. For example, the global Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI)for manufacturing recorded its highest reading in over six years inApril 2010, but eased back subsequently, pickingup again only recently. Similarly, CPB data show a slowing inthe rate of industrial production growth at the global level from June on.With momentum declining, global GDP growth(excl. EU) isprojected to moderate somewhat in2011-12, to around4½% compared tosome 5¼% (5)As discussed in IMF (2009) ‚World Economic Outlook',April 2009.Table I.1.1:International Environment(Real annualpercentage change)Autumn 2010   Spring 2010 forecast   forecast( a )20072008200920102011201220102011Real GDPgrowth  USA20.71.90.0-2.72.72.12.52.82.5  Japan6.02.4-1.2-5.23.51.31.72.11.5  Asia (excl.

Thus, the outlook is for a rather gradual recoveryof the world economy, with growthexpected to remain below pre-crisis levels over the forecast horizon. Developments across regions areset todiffer markedly though. For advanced economies, where temporarysupports are fading and the bulk of countries arestill grappling with the legacy of the crisis Œnamely weak labour markets, deleveragingon thepart of households and firms, as well as large fiscal deficitsŒ a more modest recovery is inprospect.US GDP is projected to grow by about 2¾% thisyear, but to fall back to just over 2% next year, before picking up again in2012 (to some 2½%). InJapan, GDP growthis forecastataround 3½% in2010, 1¼% in2011 and 1¾% in2012.  In emerging markets outside the EU and indeveloping countries, the outlook is decidedlybrighter. Emerging economies are expected toperform strongly over the forecast horizon on theback of buoyant domestic demand, trade and commodity price developments. Emerging Asia, for instance, is projectedto grow by some 8½% in2010 andby 7½% in 2011-12. Within this region, China continues to lead the way, with GDP growthof 10½% foreseenfor this year, and growthofaround 9¼% expectedin 2011and 9% in2012. Outside of Asia, the emerging economies of Russia and Brazil are projected topost solid growth in2010, with activity set to gradually pick-up thereafter in Russia, but tofall back in Brazil. World trade was also stronger inthe first half of2010 than anticipated at the time of the springforecast. Having staged an impressive rebound in the latter part of 2009, trade volumes rose by 5¾% q-o-q in the first quarter of this year and by 3½%in the second (CPB estimates). That trade is now back at pre-recession levels is attributable to a number of factors, inter alia, the recoveryof theglobal manufacturing sector, car-scrappingschemes and the inventory cycle, the reactivation of global supply chains andsome improvement intrade financing conditions.(6)Looking ahead, the global PMI for manufacturingand the OECD leading indicator for global developments have softened in recent months,suggesting some loss of momentum.(7) With(6)See the article ‚Recent developments in global and euro area trade™ in ECB (2010) ‚MonthlyBulletin™, August.(7)Indicator for the OECD region plus six large emergingmarkets.economic activity across advanced and emergingeconomies also set to slow in the coming period, the outlook is for a deceleration in world tradegrowth(excl.

Indeed, extra-euro-area exports (on a three-month over three-month basis) have beenon a broadly downwardtrend since the summer, as has the new export orders componentof the Purchasing Managers'Index. The extent of the impact on individualMember States will differ depending on their geographical and product specialisation, as well as on their competitive position(see graphs I.1.5a-b). The impactcould be quite pronounced forcountries where the share of exports going tothe US is high (e.g. Irelandandthe UK), given theprojected softening of the US economy in 2011, but less so for Member States whose exports are directed in large part towards emerging markets (e.g. Germany and Finland), where demand remains strong. For euro-area countries, part of theimpactmight also be offset via the exchange-rate channel, owing to lagged effects fromthedepreciation of the euro during the summermonths.(8) At the aggregate level, the share of theUS in EU andeuro-area exports has been falling inrecent years, whereas the share of emerging Asia has been growing. Nonetheless, as outlined inboxI.1.1, the strong influence of the US, not least through the trade channel,means that the EU /euro area is unlikely to escape unscathed fromthe expected slowdown in the US economy. (8)The technical exchange-rate assumptions for 2010-12, aswell as other external assumptions, are set out in box I.1.7.10 Economic developments at the aggregated levelBox I.1.1:What impact will developments in the US andChina have on the EU and euro area?While the Chinese economy continues to grow ata brisk pace over the forecast horizon, the USeconomy is in for a soft patch in 2011. Thisboxtakesa look at the impact of slowingUS demand on the euro-area economy via the trade channel,taking into account structural shifts in global tradeas well as the role of Asia, and in particular China,as a partial counterbalancing force.Emerging and developing economies(1) are takingan ever larger share in world growth and GDP (in PPP). They are expected to represent a larger shareofworld GDP than advanced economiesfor thefirst timeever in 2012.At the same time, the shareof the US in world GDP hasdeclined from an average of 24% over 1996-2003 to 21% in 2009 (for the EU, the figures are similar). These changes are also reflected in the changing composition ofEU exports. Table 1 shows thatexports to the USand, to a lesser extent, to other advanced economies have been shrinking as a share of EU (and euro-area) exports during the last decade. This contrasts with the growing role of China and oil-exportingcountries.

EU  and US; oil exporters (MENA + CIS + Norway); other emerging economiesWhile the shareof the US in EU exports has diminished by one third since 1999, three factorspoint to the still-large influenceof the US via thetrade channel: first, the above calculations are based on goods only, while theshare of the US isusually higherfor EU exports of services.Secondly, the picture changeswhen considering theshare in GDP. During the same period, openness has increased, thus exports to the US in terms ofEU GDP have decreased only graduallyfrom 1999to 2007. The trade slump, however, accelerated thisdecrease in 2008 and 2009. Thirdly, Dees andSaint-Guilhem(2) find evidence that "the increasing economic integration atthe world level is likely to (1)In our definition, the world excluding the EU, candidatecountries, the USA, Japan, Canada, Norway, Switzerland,Australia and New Zealand.(2)S.

As a result, euro-areaGDP would be little affected. In scenario 2, theoffsetting demand boost and exchange-rateflexibilityfromAsia is absent. In this scenario,euro-area GDP declines sharply in the firstfew years compared to baseline. The non-tradablesector performs better than the tradable, pullingtotal GDP gradually back towards the baselinescenario in subsequent years.This reflects thesignificant additional inflow of capital, which inparticular boosts demand for non-tradable goods.However, in reality the shift inresources fromtradable to non-tradable sectors would not happensmoothly, which is why scenarios with adjustment frictions (2a or 2b in Table 2) wouldbe more likelyto occur. While scenario 2a assumes frictions in theform of a temporary decline of averageproductivity in the non-tradablesector due tomismatches in resource allocation, scenario2badditionally assumes unchanged interest rates in theeuro area. On the other hand, the more benign scenario 2c presumes smooth adjustment with nonegative productivity effect during the restructuringphase and no binding restrictions on monetarypolicy. This scenario requires aproper functioningoffinancial markets and additional flexibility in theEU economy, underlining the importance of theEurope 2020 strategy of structural reform.

Over the forecasthorizon, commodity prices are generally projectedto increase; rebounding sharply in 2010, though risingby considerably less thereafter given stillsignificant spare capacity and inventories. Oil prices are now assumed to average USD 79.9/bl. in 2010, USD 88.9/bl. in 2011 and USD 90.8/bl. in 2012. – while financial-market conditions gradually improve Turning todevelopments on the financial front, markets have recovered somewhat fromthe sovereign-debt crisis of last May. Although progress has been unsteady, the past few monthshave seen equity-market indices edge-up and a normalisation in money-market rates, while corporate-bond spreads have, in the main, beenona broadly downward trend. On the backof policy measures Œ among them the establishment of theEuropean Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility Œ tensionsin sovereign-bond markets themselves eased, though some stress has reappeared lately. As discussed in box I.1.2, investors have started todifferentiate more clearly between sovereign issuers, with the result that benchmark yields have fallen significantly (reflecting their safe haven status), whereas government-bond yields remainhigh in a number of euro-area Member States (notably Greece, Ireland and Portugal). In the banking sector, the situation appears tobeimproving. For instance, the solvency position ofbanks has brightened since the spring, with the EU-wide stress test exercise carriedout in July 2010 finding that the system as a whole is fairly resilient, despite some pockets of vulnerability.(9)Banks have also reported strong profits in recent months, which should allow them to better cover potential future loan losses. Moreover, it seemsthat the rise in funding costs and difficulties inaccessing funding markets experienced in the second quarter of the year, due to concerns aboutthe sector's exposure to sovereign risk, eased in thethird.  As for lending activity, the latest ECB BankLending Survey (October 2010) points to a stabilisation in the tightening of credit standards for enterprises over the coming period, and to aneasing in standards for households. Lending to households has in fact been rising, albeit modestly, for some time in the euro area, though it is stilldeclining for non-financial corporations. The pace of the latter is moderating however, with the turning point even in sight (see graphI.1.6d).  As discussed last spring, recoveries in private sectorcredit growthtypically lag economic upturns by atleast a year.(10) With developments so far largely inline withpast patterns, support from the credit sideto the real economy can be expected to materialise towards the endof this year. (9)The detailed results can be found in CEBS (2010)'Aggregate outcome of the 2010 EU wide stress test exercise coordinated by CEBS in cooperation with the ECB'.

Overall, a further gradual improvement in financial conditions is expected over the forecast horizon, as economic activity strengthens and fiscal consolidation programmes are implemented. The road ahead is set to remain rough though, with periods of stress likely in light of still significant challenges.

Inparticular, sovereign yields provide thebenchmark interest rate, i.e. risk pricing reference, for the economyas a whole. Consequently, highergovernment-bond yields tend to translate intohigherfinancingcosts for financial institutions,households and corporations, although the evidenceon the strength of the linkage is mixed (see BoxI.2.1 in chapter I.2).Conversely, government-bond yields mayalso beinfluenced by private-sector developments. Forexample, during the financial crisis, manygovernments issued guaranteesfor bonds issued bybanks, thereby keeping the financing costs of banksartificially low. However, these guarantees effectively transferred risk from the banking sectorto the sovereign sector and created contingentliabilities for Member States. Asa result, investorshave started to price in this transferred risk into government-bonds' premia and, on thisbasis, havedifferentiated more clearly between euro-area sovereign issuers.0100200300400500Jan-08Jul-08Jan-09Jul-09Jan-10Jul-10FinancialNon-financialGovernmentGraph 1:Euro-area yield spreads vis-à-vis benchmarksbps.Source: Merrill Lynch, BloombergSince some sovereign bonds have started to beperceived as riskier than before, their yield spreads vis-à-vis the benchmark havewidened. In parallel,the price of risk offinancial assets has increased.Hence, the return on safe assets declined and spreads to riskier assets increased.This transfer of risk has not only had an impact on sovereign-bond yields. The new borrowing requirements of sovereigns havealso translated intoincreased bondissuance. Higher volumes ofsovereign issuance can lead to a crowding outofprivate sector financing, particularly in times ofhigh risk aversion. It should be noted, however,that the extent of such crowdingout(and wideningofyield spreads) is also a functionof perceivedrisk: for example, large international companies are often considered less risky than some sovereigns due to betterdiversified income sources, andthereby, continue to enjoy a relativelygoodstandingon capital markets in times ofmoreadverse conditions in financial markets.  02004006008001000050607080910Graph 2:Euro-area government-bond issuance(as of September 30, 2010)bn EURSource: BloombergWhile activity is set to moderate towards the endof2010, the better thanexpected performance in the first half of the year, and the spillover of someof this momentuminto the second, imply a significant upward revision to annual growthcompared tothe spring forecast. For 2010 asa whole, GDP is now expected to grow by around1¾% in both the EU and euro area. However, thisaggregate picture masks divergent developmentsacross Member States; for example, growth hasbeen revised markedlyup inGermany, but downin Greece. Indeed, despite signs thatsome adjustment isstarting to take place, imbalances within the euro area remain significant. These partly reflectstructural weaknesses, such as weaknesses in domestic demand (in surplus countries) and weak price and cost competitiveness (indeficit countries), often combinedwith high debt levels in the latter.(12)(12)See chapter 1 in European Commission (2010) 'EuropeanEconomic Forecast Œ Spring 2010' and European Commission (2010) ‚Quarterly Report on the Euro Area™, Volume 9, No 1. 14 Economic developments at the aggregated level-4-3-2-10123406070809101112Surplus countries Deficit countriesGraph I.1.8:Decomposition of the current account,euro areapps.forecastNote: Euro-areaMember States are identified as surplusordeficitcountries on thebasisof their current-account position in 2006.Thisiskeptunchangedover the entire periodAs for GDP growth further out, a number of factors are set to shape prospects for the EU and euro area. On the one hand, indications that therecovery is broadening out and the expected gradual improvementin financial-marketconditions bode well for real activity in 2011 and2012. There is also a possibility that recentimprovementsin Germanycould have knock-oneffects for other Member States. Model-based estimates presented in box I.1.3point topositive spillovers in this regard. On the other hand, the less buoyantexternal environment can be expected to weigh on activitygoing forward. With Member States also embarking on retrenchment programmes in the period ahead (if not already), an additional factorto be considered is the impact of fiscalconsolidation. As highlightedby the thematic chapter on this issue, the macroeconomic effect of such consolidation depends on its composition and perceived credibility. Stylised simulations show that a permanent consolidation amounting to 1% ofGDP, made upof spending cutsand tax rises proportional to their current budget shares, wouldlower GDP by about 0.3% in the first year, thoughthe long-run impact is positive. They also showthat growth-enhancing structural reforms can ease the burdenof fiscal adjustment (see also the thematic chapter on structural reforms).  These various forces are expected to play outthrough the main components of EU / euro-areaGDP. Somedifferentiation in their effect ishowever likely across Member States, reflecting, inter alia, differences in the export dependency ofeconomies and the scale of structural and budgetary adjustment challenges.

GDP surged by 2.3% q-o-q in the secondquarter (9.6% annualised), the highest growth ratesince German reunification. Beyond temporarycatch-up effects in construction activity due to thecold winter, exports remained the engine driving the German upswing. However, the quicker-than-expected recovery also benefited substantially from a revitalised domestic economy, with bothinvestment and private consumption displayingtangible positive growth contributions. What are the growth implications of the stronger-than-expected performance of the Germaneconomyfor the rest of the euro area and the EU?This box presents model-based estimates of the potential spillovers from upward GDP growthrevisions in Germany to growth prospectsin otherMember States. The exercise uses a four-regionversion of the Commission's QUEST III model.The four regions are Germany, the rest of the euroarea, the non-euro-area EU members, andthe restof the world.(1)Model-based estimates of spilloversThefirst, direct, spill-over effect fromGDP growth over a two-year horizon occurs via demand linkages.Growthin economic activity increases thedemand for intermediate inputs, which are partlyimported. It also increases income, consumption and investment, which partly impact on imports aswell. Themodel captures these trade linkages between Germany and its Europeanneighbours.The second, indirect, channel includes the stanceofmonetary policyin response to developmentsaffecting euro-area aggregates, and the reactionofcommon variables such as the euro exchange rate. Graphs 1a and 1b show estimates of spill-overeffects for thefollowing illustrative scenario. Global demand raisesGerman exports by 5%. Theincrease in exports comes via higher importdemand in the rest of the world that is fully targetedto German exports. As a consequence, Germandomestic demand rises by 1% in the sameyear.(2)The export demand shock lasts for two years, but dueto endogenousprice and policy responses itsimpact ondemand and activity weakens in 2012. It(1) For details on QUEST III andits application to policy analysis, seehttp://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/research/macroeconomic_models_en.htm.(2) In the absence ofmonetary tightening, higher export demanditselfcontributes tothe increase in domestic demand through the income effectfromhigher employment and the realinterest rate reduction.is assumed that policy interest rates in the euro area remain frozen in 2011 and public spending is heldconstant in real terms.  0.00.40.81.21.62.020112012DEEA excl. DEEU excl. EAGraph 1a:Spillovers toGDP%0.00.40.81.220112012DEEA excl. DEEU excl. EAGraph 1b:Spillovers to domesticdemand%Given these assumptions, the aggregate spill-overeffectfromGermany to the restof the EU and theeuro-area economy as awhole is substantial. Thefirst-year output effect of 1.8% in Germany raisesimport demand by 2.7%.  The stronger importdemand translates into higher exportdemand forother euro-area countries (1.2%) and fornon-euro-area EU economies (1.1%). In turn, thisgenerates higher domestic demand (0.3-0.4%) andGDP (0.6-0.7%) in these countries. Overall, theestimated spill-over effect froma 1% increase in domestic demand in Germany translates into a0.4% increase in domesticdemand in othereuro-area countries, and 0.3% in non-euro-area EUeconomies, in the first year. The impact of the export demand shockon German GDP and, via thedemand spillovers,on GDP in therest of the EU, is strongest in thefirst year in whichpolicy interest rates are assumed to remainconstant. Nominal rates increase in the secondyear,(Continued on the next page)16 Economic developments at the aggregated levelBox (continued) to the extent that EU central banks react toinflationary pressure from higher demand. Given the assumed change in the monetary stance in2012, real interest rates increase, and the euro and other EU currencies appreciate relative to the restof theworld in 2011-12. Inaddition, strongerdemand-driven pressureon production costs andprices in EU economies in 2011 contribute to theappreciationof the real effective exchange rate.Asa consequence ofincreasing interest rates and realappreciation,domestic and export demand weaken throughout the EU in 2012compared to 2011, butthey still remain above the original baseline. Possible spillovers from stronger domesticdemand in GermanyThe extent to which stronger export and domesticdemand in Germany could entail beneficialspill-over effects for the rest of theEU/euro areadepends strongly on four, interrelated, factors: trade(including its composition and competitiveness issues); financial and credit conditions; confidenceand policy implications.  The model estimates presented in the previoussection focussed on the first factor. The rest of the EU/euro area is set to benefit via the trade channelfrom higher domestic demand in Germany andassociated higher imports. Theimport content ofGerman exports and the German export share have increased in recent years. At the same timehowever, these trade linkages shouldnotbeoverestimated. On average, only about 13% ofFrench, Italian,Portuguese, Greek, Spanish and UKgoods exports go to Germany (see Graph 2).  Moreover, the extent to which individual countriescan benefit from strongerGerman imports dependsnot only on their geographical proximity but also on their competitiveness position. All things beingequal, positive spill-over effects via the tradechannel are likely to be more pronounced for thosecountries which have preserved theircompetitiveness (e.g. Central and East Europeaneconomies). Theymight be less significant forcountries thathave been sufferingfromcompetitiveness losses.  The overall impact of stronger domestic demand growth in Germany on the rest of the EU/euro areais also likely to depend on the nature andcomposition of this stronger demand. Arguably, spill-over effects could be larger in the case of stronger private-sector demand, whereas strongerpublic-sectordemand would boost domestic growth to a larger extent,giventhe low import content ofpublic investment and because currentpublicspending is to a large extent comprised of wages and benefits.  051015202530CZ, PL,SK, HU,SIAT, NL,LU, BE,DKRO, BGFR,IT,PT, EL,ES, UKLT, LV,EE, MT,CYFI, SE,IEGraph 2:Member States' sharesof exportsgoing to Germany (goods, 2009)%Improvingfinancial-market conditions can beexpected to reinforce transmission mechanismsbetween Germany and othercountries. Surveyevidence suggests that the attitude of banks tocredit risks has improved. This change in riskpreferences has partlyfed through to actual lendingbehaviour.The improved growth outlookforGermany can yield positive confidence effects, impacting on theprospects of the EU economy as a whole. Such confidence effects are partially captured by the model, but aredifficult to measure and can havea pervasive impact on real-sector activity across Member States. Most recent data are suggestive ofimproving confidence, especiallyin services, a sector more directly affected by domestic demanddevelopments than industry. Finally, the size of spill-over effects will depend onthe policy response. In particular, the monetarypolicy reaction to increased inflationary pressureon the back of higher domestic demand woulddampen the spill-over effect.  17 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Beginning with the outlook for exports, this demand component is expected to continuesupporting the recoverygoing forward, albeit toa lesser extent than in the first half of this year. Mirroring developments in global activity and trade, export growth is projected to decelerate over the forecast horizon, to around6½% in the EU in2011-12 from over10% this year; and to about6¼% in the euro area from some 10¾%.Graph I.1.9:Global demand, euro-area exportsand new exportorders-12-8-4048129900010203040506070809101112293643505764Exports (q-o-q%, lhs), forecast(y-o-y%, lhs)Output index (Global PMIcomposite, rhs)New export orders (Euro-area PMI, rhs)%forecast3-month moving averageAs discussed last spring, apick-up in exports isa necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for a self-sustaining recovery in the EU.(13) For this tocome about, a strengthening ofprivate demand isalso needed. Hence, growth prospects forgross fixed capital investment and private consumption are of key importance at the current juncture.

This reflects a relatively strong outlookfor equipment investment, but amore muted one forconstruction.Equipment investment is infact set toreturn to positive growth this year, somewhat earlier than envisaged at the time of the spring forecast (with a particularlystrong rebound foreseen for Germany,Italy andLuxembourg). Prospects for next yearhavealso beenrevised up, byalmost2 pps. intheeuro area, with growth of some 5¾% foreseen for 2012. In addition to the impetus from the export-led industrial rebound, this brighter outlook follows from improvements in the profit situation offirms and the capacity utilisation rate. The latter stood at around 77½% inthe euro area in the fourth quarter of 2010, not far off its long-termaverage (just above 80%). Conversely, corporatedeleveraging, along with fiscal consolidation, is setto act as a constraint on equipment investmentgrowth over the forecast horizon, especially inMember States where the indebtedness level of firms prior tothe crisis was high (e.g. Portugal). According to empirical research, balance-sheetadjustment in the corporate sector takes time,lastingon  average  eight  years.(14)This, together (14)Discussed in European Commission (2010) ‚Quarterly Report on the Euro Area™, Volume 9, No 3. The sample on which the findings are based includes the 27 EU Member States, the US and Japan, and covers the last three decades.Economic developments at the aggregated levelBox I.1.4:How muchdeleveraging has takenplace?The household and non-financial corporate sectorsin many EU Member States accumulated high volumes of debt in theyears prior to the financial crisis. Historicalevidence suggests that financial crises are most oftenfollowed by a protracted period of sizeable balance-sheet adjustments by the most heavily indebted economic actors.(1) Sucha deleveraging process usually translates intoreduced GDP growthover several years, due tosubdued growth in investment and consumption.This box highlights the state of the deleveragingprocess in the EU householdand non-financial corporate sectors, providing somemeasure of howfar into the adjustment process Member States are,and to what extent deleveraging is weighing oneconomic growth. Over the pastdecade, EU households haveincreased their borrowing steadilyand since 2002,debt accumulation has even accelerated,(2) inparallel with rising real estateprices. The grossindebtedness ofhouseholds, relative to gross disposable income (GDI), surged in the euro areafrom 75% in 2001 to 95% in 2008. As bankstightened creditstandards andnet credit growthslowed sharply in the wake of the crisis, EU households' debt accumulation has slowed down.However, due to a corresponding slowdown inGDI, the average debt ratio in the euro area continued to riseslightly in 2009 (to 96%). Thisaggregate debt level remains low compared to otheradvanced economies such as the US and Japan.Itmasks, however, significant differences among Member States. Household debt ratios areparticularly highin Denmark, the Netherlands,Ireland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal,Spain, Cyprus and Greece. In the course of2009,households in, for example, Ireland, the UK andSpain have started to deleverage. In countries withless severe housing market corrections, there are sofar no clear signs of debt reduction. The low levelof interest rates and the increased use of variable interest rates have eased the debt-servicingburden,(3) which may also have reduced pressure toadjust debt levels, implyinga significant risk of adjustment pressurewhen interest rates begin to rise. (1)See e.g. Tang, G. and C. Upper, Debt reduction after crises, BIS Quarterly Review,September 2010, pp. 25-38.(2)Anotable exception was Germany, where debt relative todisposable income declined to about 90%, see e.g.QuarterlyReport on the Euro Area, Vol. 9, No. 3, September 2010.(3)Since their peakin the third quarter of2008, households'interest paymentshave declined substantially.

Supportedby a strong rebound in earnings and subduedinvestment, thenet lending position of the non-financial corporate sector has become positivesince mid-2009. Consequently, a gradual decline indebt ratios isunderway. However, debt ratiosremain quite high in historical terms, and relative to countries like theUS. In the first quarter of 2010,the ratios of debt to GDP and gross entrepreneurialincomewereabout 67% and 334% respectively in the euro area.The deleveraging pattern is unevenly spread acrossMember States. While debt ratios are moving down in, for example,  Belgium, Denmarkand the UnitedKingdom, theywerestill trending higher Œ todifferent degrees Œ in,for example, France, Ireland,Portugal and Spain. Following the gradual recoveryin equity markets, debt-to-equity ratios have onaverage in the euro area declined from their peak inthe first quarter of 2009, but remain high (70%in the first quarter of 2010), and particularly so inGreece, Latvia andIreland.Subdued issuance ofnew equity in Europe compared tobond issuancehas not helped in making corporatebalance sheetsmore robust.  All in all, it would seem that the deleveraging process in both sectors is still at an early stage. Thisslow start to this process, compared to whathistorical evidence would suggest, may be partlyexplained by low interest rates and the relateddecline in thedebt-servicing burden. 19 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 with the limited progress in this respect to date (see box I.1.4), suggests that equipment investment will face headwinds on this front for quite a while yet. -24-16-808169900010203040506070809101112687276808488Equipmentinvestment (q-o-q%, lhs), forecast (y-o-y%,lhs)Capacity utilisationrate (rhs)Equipmentinvestment (y-o-y%, lhs) %%forecastGraph I.1.10:Equipment investment and capacityutilisation in manufacturing, euro areaGraph I.1.11:Housing investmentand buildingpermits, euroarea-12-8-40489900010203040506070809101112-40-30-20-10010

While leading supplyindicators such as building permits have recovered somewhat of late (e.g. the number of permitsissued in the EU was up by around 12% y-o-y in June 2010), the stock of unsold housing is set toact as a dragon investment activity for some timeto come. Moreover, price corrections are still ongoing in anumber of Member States, notablyIreland and Spain. Recent empirical work findsthat this adjustment process tends to be fairly slow, with most countries taking two to four years to halve house-price imbalances (with the exceptionof Ireland, where the adjustment has been much more rapid).(15) Finally, consolidation measures are expected toweigh on income growth, and thus onhousing demand in the periodahead.   Similarly, fiscal consolidation is set to havea dampening effecton public investment spendingover the forecast horizon, implying a weakeroutlook for the non-residential component of construction investment.  Turning toprivate consumption,where the impetus from the export-led industrial rebound has also materialised earlier than expected in the spring. Indeed, a modest pick-up inconsumer spending isnow foreseenfor this year. A gradual firming isexpected thereafter; supported by a slowlyimproving employment outlook, moderate incomegrowth and subdued inflation. The decline in the savingrate from its peakduring the crisis also augers well in this respect. Going in the opposite direction, deleveraging on the part of households issetto weigh on private consumption growth overthe forecast horizon. As outlined in box I.1.4, the process ofbalance-sheet repair is still at an early stage in many of the Member States withhigh household debt-levels inthe pre-crisis period(e.g. Denmark and the Netherlands), though it seemsmore advanced in some, namely Ireland, Spain and the UK. Likewise, fiscal consolidation is expectedto have a dampening effecton consumer spending, especially in 2011. To give an illustrative order ofmagnitude, the stylised 1%of GDP consolidation scenario mentioned previously would lower consumption by about 0.4% in the first year (see also the thematic chapter on fiscal consolidation). Overall, private consumption in the EU is forecastto expandby about 1¼% and 1½% in 2011 and 2012 respectively (and by close to 1% and 1½% in the euro area).

Compared to the spring forecast, the outlook for 2011 has been reviseddown in a numberof Member States, including theperipheral and some emerging economies (e.g. Slovakia and the Czech Republic). Another force set to constrain the recoverysomewhat is the estimated adverse impact of thefinancial crisis onpotential output, with growth rates in this respect possibly notreturning to pre-crisis levels.(16) As discussed in the thematicchapter on structural reforms, potential growth is expected to suffer from a much lower contributionfrom labour in the period ahead, owing to a rise inthe structural rate of unemployment, as well asfrom smaller contributions from capital accumulation and total factor productivity. Potential output growth in the euro area isprojected at around 1% over the forecast horizon,whereas prior to the crisis (2000-07), the rate was close to 2%.  As regards overall growth prospects for 2011and 2012, drawing the above elements together, economic activity is expected to soften next year, to around 1¾% in the EU and 1½% in the euro (16)For instance, growth rates of potential output may not return to pre-crisis levels on account of a permanent changein financing conditions and / or a sustained need fordeleveraging. As a result, capital accumulation will be slower. The impact of this may be reinforced by parts ofthe capital stock becoming obsolete even faster. This, in turn, would adverselyaffect total factor productivity growth. For further details, see European Commission(2009) 'The impact of the financial and economic crisis onpotential output', European Economy Œ Occasional Papers49.area; but to pick-up in2012 in both regions, tosome 2% and 1¾% respectively. Thus, realGDP isset to grow above potential over the forecast horizon, meaning that the negative EU / euro-areaoutputgap shoulddiminish in size, though it is notprojected to close by 2012. While this picture is largely unchanged at the aggregate level for 2011, an increased differentiation in the speed of recovery is projected among Member States compared to the spring forecast.  In sum, the recovery of the EU economyappearsto be takinghold. Indeed, thegradual strengthening of private demand over the forecasthorizon, and reduced reliance onexport growth, isindicative of a recovery that is becoming increasingly self-sustaining. That said, the EUeconomy still faces significant headwinds as it transits towards a new steady state. Moreover, developments across Member States remain uneven, with the recovery set to continueadvancing at a relatively fast pace in some, but to lag behind inothers. This reflects differences inthe scale of adjustment challenges acrosseconomies and ongoing rebalancingwithin the EUand euro area.

The second quarter of2010 saw job shedding come to an end in the EU, while employment remained stable in the euro area(at0%q-o-q). Similarly, the unemployment ratehas more or less held steady since the spring, at 9.6% in the EU and around 10% in the euro area.  21 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Box I.1.5:The resilience of the euro-area labour marketWhile historicalexperience suggests thatactivityrates decrease (sometimes persistently) aseconomic growth recedes, the euro-area labourmarket has shown remarkable resilience during therecent recession:activity rates increased slightly,spurred by theolder and femaleworkercomponents. While the lattermay be related to changes in thesocial attitude toward femaleemployment, policymeasurestaken during thecrisis to avoid early exit from the labour marketmay have played a role. There are considerable differences inunemploymentresponses across countries.Unemployment in Germany and the Netherlandsresponded verymildly to the recession, with anapparent elasticity of the unemployment rate togrowth from peak to trough of below 0.05 in bothcountries. A response more in line with standard"Okun-law" estimates was recorded in Italy andFrance (elasticities of 0.24 and 0.39 respectively), whereas major hikes in unemployment wererecorded in Spain, Greece and Ireland (1.88,0.79,and 0.55 respectively).The factors that explain cross-country differences in labour-market performance include: (i)thesectoral composition of output; (ii) capacityutilisation and firm profitabilityat the start of thecrisis; (iii) the characteristics of existinglabour-market institutions; and (iv) policymeasurestaken to contain labour shedding. It appears that thecountries most affected by house-price correctionsexperienced major employment losses and thelargest increasesin unemployment after the crisis(seeTable 1, which displays sectoral employment developments in selectedeuro-area countries).Conversely, in spite of a major drop in thedemand for durable manufactured goods, countries witha relatively high share ofmanufacturing output(notablyGermany) experienced more limited labour shedding. This could be related to strongerexpectations of a labour-demand recovery in the manufacturing than in theconstruction sector. Thismay havemotivated firms to use flexibleworkingtimearrangements, and governments to put inplace, for the first time in some cases, short-timeworking schemeswith a view to avoiding wasteful labour shedding.(1) In Germany, labour hoardingwas mostlya voluntaryresponseof firms with solid(1)For a description ofthese schemes see EuropeanCommission (DG ECFIN), LabourMarket and WageDevelopments in2009,European Economy No 5.financial positions. This followed a long period ofemployment restructuring, with emerging skill shortages before the crisis also playing a role. Thus,working-hour reductions were largely initiated byemployers, rather than being the result ofgovernment-sponsored short-time working schemes.(2)Table 1:Sectoral employment growth in selected euro-area Member StatesEADEIEESFRITNLManufacturing-1.4-0.4-2.0-3.3-0.8-1.1-0.Construction-1.70.1-5.8-4.90.0-0.4-0.5Market services-0.50.0-1.0-1.2-0.6-0.6-0.Manufacturing-1.0-0.9:-0.6-1.2-1.4-0.7Construction-0.90.1:-2.5-0.40.4-0.9Market services-0.10.1:0.10.00.1-0.4Peak to troughTrough to 2010Q287Looking forward, the question arises as to whetherthe current resilienceof the euro-area labourmarket can be sustained. Answers are largely country-specific, depending, inter alia, on possiblefurther job destruction related to sectoraladjustment, the extent of job shedding in the publicsector, and the phasing out ofgovernment-sponsored short-timeworking schemes.An analysis of job marketflows could provideindications of unemployment prospects. Incountries strongly affected by thebursting ofhouse-price bubbles (e.g. Spain and Ireland) theincrease in job destruction after thecrisis (inflowsinto unemployment) was much larger than in othereuro-area countries, especiallyGermany. Recent trends suggest a decline inunemployment inGermany and the Netherlands,duetoa combination of reduced job destruction andincreased job creation (outflows fromunemployment).  Changes in job destruction appear to offset those injob creation in France and Italy,with France experiencing lower entry into unemployment butalso lower exit rates, while Italy is exhibiting theopposite pattern. An analysisof labour-marketflows(3) suggestsgrimmer unemployment prospectsin Spain, with a persistently high job destructionrate not compensated for by improvements in exit rates from unemployment.

Curci, 'EUlabour market behaviour during the Great Recession',European Economy Economic Papers, no. 405,2010.22 Economic developments at the aggregated levelSurveyindicators of firms'employment expectationspoint to moderate job creation goingforward, as does the PMI employment index whichcrossed the 50-mark in the EU last April. Taken together with the strong upward revisionto economic growth, it seems that the labour market may hold up somewhat better this year thanpreviously expected. And indeed, employment is now projected tocontractbyabout ½% in the EU and ¾% in the euro area in 2010, some ¼ pp. lessthan envisaged at the time of the spring forecast. Modest growth is expected thereafter, of close to ½% in 2011 and ¾% in 2012 in the EU (andofsome ¼% and ½% respectively in the euro area).    While the outlook is for a gradual improvement over the forecast horizon, labour-market conditionsare set to remain relatively weak for a number of reasons. First, as noted above, there isusually a time lag of around 2-3 quarters between cyclical developments in activity and the labour market. Second, policy measures implemented in responseto the recession are expected to be unwound, atleast in part, over the coming quarters. Third,structural adjustment is still takingplace across sectors and firms, with fiscal consolidation alsoexpected to lead to somerestructuring and jobshedding in the public sector in a number ofMember States in the period ahead.

Thus, the unemployment rate is projected tograduallyfall, from around9½% this year in the EU to justover 9% by 2012. Likewise, a ½ pp. decline isexpected in the euro-area rate, from about 10% to9½%. This outlook is also brighter than the spring forecast due to the resilience shown in someMember States to date. For example, the Germanunemployment rate is projected to be the same thisyear as in 2008, in sharp contrast to the situation inSpain, where the unemployment rate is expected tobe around 8¾ pps. higher than two years ago. Asdiscussed in boxI.1.5, such cross-countrydivergences in labour-market performance followfrom, inter alia, the sectoral composition ofoutput,capacity utilisation and firm profitability at the outset of the crisis, the characteristics of labour-market institutions and the policy response. 6789101100010203040506070809101112Actual unemployment rateNAWRU%forecastGraph I.1.16:Actual and structuralunemployment rates, euro areaWhile the labour-market situation is expected toimprove overall, a rather jobless recovery still seems in sight, with(potentially persistent) highunemployment. The unemployment rate in the EU and euro area is in fact set to stay above the structural rate (NAWRUi.e. the non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment) over theforecast horizon.However, recalling the thematic labour-market chapter that accompanied the 2009 autumnforecast, EU labour markets have becomemoreflexible and resilient on the backof reformsenacted over the last decade, implying that increases inunemployment could be less persistentthan in the past.(17)– and inflation remaining subdued – On the nominal side, consumer-price inflation hasrisen moderately in 2010 so far, on the back ofupward food and energy base effects, as well as increasing global commodity prices. As already mentioned, oil and metal prices have been firming for some timenow, while the sharppick-up in the price of some agro-commodities during the summer has given rise tofears of a generalised hike in foodprices, akin to the crisis of 2008. However, as discussed in box I.1.6,marketconditions are very different now compared to two(17)See chapter 2 in European Commission (2009) 'EuropeanEconomic Forecast Œ Autumn 2009'.23 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 ince turning positive inthe spring, producer-price On the wage front, the two main indicators for the Weighing upthese developments, inflation Inflation expectations offer further support to this years ago. For instance, food stocks are muchhigher at present. The headline rate of inflation currently stands at 2.2% in the EU and 1.8% in the euro area (September 2010), whereas the core rate (i.e. HICPinflation excluding energy and unprocessedfood) is some ¾ pp. lower in both regions. Sinflation has alsobeen on a broadly upward trend.Industrial prices in the euro area were up by 4.2%y-o-y inSeptember, due to a combinationof baseeffects and increases in the price of energy and intermediate inputs.euroarea have shown some divergence of late, though the overall picture is oneofrelativelymuted wage growth. While the annual growth rateof hourly labour costs slowed in the second quarterof the year, to1.6% from 1.9% in the first, nominal compensation per employee accelerated (rising by 2% compared to 1.5% inthe previous quarter).With continuing labour-market slack set todampen upward pressures somewhat, wage growth isprojected to remain moderate over the forecasthorizon. Partly because of this, but alsobecause ofimproving labour productivity, unit-labour cost growth is expected to turnnegative this year, withonly a modest rebound foreseen thereafter, to around 1¼% in the EU and to almost 1% in the euro area in2012. The outlook in thisrespect isgenerallymore muted for peripheral economies,reflecting the steps being taken to restore lost competitiveness.  prospects appear rather subdued. The remaining slack in the economy, along with fairly moderatewage and unit-labour cost growth are expected tokeep inflation in check goingforward,notwithstanding slightly higher commoditypricesand increases in indirect taxation and administered prices in some Member States. The latter come on the backof fiscal consolidation efforts, for example, the VAT rate in the UK is due to rise from 17.5% to 20% in January 2011 as part of the Government™s adjustment programme.  outlook, remaining well-anchored according tostandard measures (see graph I.1.8).

Apart from buoyant economicgrowth, the food-price boom was driven byacombination of adverse weather conditions andthe diversion ofsomefood commodities to theproduction of biofuels. Moreover, government policies (including export bans and prohibitivetaxes) brought global stocks of manyfoodcommodities down to levels not seen since theearly 1970s. The weakening and/or reversal ofthese push-factors, coupled with the financial crisis that erupted in September 2008 and the subsequentglobal economicdownturn, induced sharp pricedeclines across most commodities (see Graph 1).75125175225275 Jan07 Jul07 Jan08 Jul08 Jan09 Jul09 Jan10 Jul10FoodMetalsEnergyGraph 1:Commodity-price developments, 2007-10Index 2005=100Commodity prices bottomed out in February 2009and rebounded quickly thereafter. The pattern ofcommodity prices over the past two yearscontrastswith previous global downturns and recoveries,especiallygiven the severity of the globalrecession. According to the IMF (WEO April 2010), commodity prices rebounded more quicklydue to strong growth in energy-intensive emergingAsian economies, smaller increases in stocks, andthe US dollar depreciation, together with continuedaccommodative monetary policy in advancedeconomies.Oil prices (Brent) have largely remainedwithinarelatively narrow range of 70-80 USDper barrelsince the fall in 2009. According to supply anddemand estimates by the IEA, high OPEC sparecapacity and OECD inventories, as well as non-OPEC supplygains, suggest that upward pricepressures should remain moderate for some time.  In contrast to oil prices, non-energy commodityprices have beenmore volatile and have shown marked increases in recentmonths. Metal priceshave nearly doubled since their trough in February2009. The sharp recoverywas mostly driven byrising Chinese demand. Large idle capacity andsoftening demand growth from China (althoughless than initially expected) are expected to limit future price increases (perhaps with the exception of rare earth commodities).  Agricultural commodity prices havefallen lessduring the downturn and have recently become lessresponsive to changing global economic conditions.Supply conditions have beenthe dominantdeterminant of agricultural-pricedevelopments. During the summer of 2010, some agriculturalcommodities, including wheat, sufferedadversesupply shocks, leading to sharp price increases. This has had someknock-on impacts to possiblesubstitutes such as rice, barley and maize. Yet, the spillovers to most other agricultural commodities have so far been relatively limited.   The spike in the prices of several food commodities over the summer of 2010 was reminiscent of the 2008 food crisis. However, the current food-pricespike is smaller in size (see Graph 2), less broad-based across commodities, and is driven bydifferent factors compared to 2008. It is tightlylinked to supply side shocks in specific grains, rather than broader global commodity price pressures and export restrictions. In addition, thestocks are much higher than theywere in 2008.Nevertheless, prices ofsome grains are nearing their previous heights, andthere are increasingrisks that low-income countries will again havemajor difficulties in coping with higher food prices. 80901001101201301401501601357911131517192123Months2007-082009-10Graph 2:Comparison of 2007-08 and 2009-10food-price increasesIndex Jan 07 =10025 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 – while public finances start to adjust As noted earlier, a common legacy of the recentrecession in the EU has been the shadow cast on public finances. That said, the deterioration in the budgetary position has been more marked incertain countries (i.e. the peripheral and someemerging economies, e.g. Latvia and Lithuania,along with the UK) than in others (such asSweden). A year into the recovery and someadjustment seems to be taking place on the fiscal side, witharound half of EU Member States settopost a lower generalgovernment deficit this yearthan in 2009. A notable exception in this respect is Ireland.(18)Net of the one-off intervention in Ireland, the general government deficit in the EU is projected to fall from some 6½% ofGDP this year to just over 5% in2011. This represents a downwardrevision compared to the spring forecast (of roughly ¾ pp. in 2010 and 1½ pps. in2011),mainly due to stronger than expected economicactivity this year and the additional consolidation measures (mostly on the expenditure side) adoptedsince, including the budget proposals for2011 inmost countries. A further decline in the deficit, toabout 4¼%, is foreseen for 2012 as the recoverygains ground. This downward trend is alsoevident in the euro area, where a deficit of some 6% ofGDP is expected this year, falling to around 4½% in 2011 and slightly below 4% in2012.(19) The picture here is also somewhat brighter than in the spring. In terms of the components, a more pronounced decline in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio is now projected in the EU, while the revenue ratio is expected to slowly converge towards its pre-crisis level from 2011on.  With the stimulus measures taken by severalMember States to promote investment, supporthouseholds' purchasingpower, help enterprises and sustain labour markets (in line with the European Economic Recovery Plan) coming to anend, and the consolidation phase increasingly (18)The exceptional intervention by the Irish Government tosupport Anglo Irish Bank and two smaller building societies (in the form of promissory notes amounting toapproximately 31 billion euro) is expected to temporarily increase the deficit, to around 32¼% of GDP in 2010.(19)In accordance with the usual no-policy-change assumption, these projections exclude any budgetary decisions that Member States may take but which are not yet sufficiently known and/or spelled out at this point, including furthermeasures in line with the recommendations ofongoingExcessive Deficit Procedures. taking hold, the fiscal stance is set to turnrestrictive in2011 in the EU and euro area. In other words, fiscal conditions will act as a dragonGDP growth.

The pace of the increase is set tomoderate somewhat though, largely on the back of less negative primary balances goingforward (see table I.1.5).(20) In the EU, the gross debtratio is projected torise to a level of over 83% of GDP by2012; and to almost 88% in the euro area.

The stock-flow adjustment includes differencesin cash and accrualaccounting, accumulation of financialassetsand valuation and other residual effects 1End of period(20)Note that the exceptional magnitude of the stock-flow adjustment in 2008 largely reflects the sizeable financialsector rescue interventions. Public money amounting toabout 2.1% of EU GDP has been injected into this sector in the form of recapitalisation since 2008. These measuresaffect government debt, but not the deficit. Moreover, guarantees to the financial sector of around 24½% of EUGDP have been approved by the European Commission, ofwhich 6% of GDP has actually been granted so far.Impaired asset relief and liquidity support to the bankingsector, similar in nature to guarantees, amount to almost 4% of GDP (approved). Guarantees represent contingent liabilities which affect the government deficit (and debt) only once they are called on.26 Economic developments at the aggregated levelWith high debt ratios projected at the aggregate level and for many Member States, debt could alsoact as a drag on economic activity in the period ahead. According to research findings, high levelsof debt relative to GDP are associated with significantly lower growth outcomes in bothadvanced and emerging economies.(21) As discussed in the fiscal consolidation chapter, thereare three main channels through which this effectcan come about; namely higher savings on the partof households, the financing of deficits via distortionary taxation and increases ingovernmentrisk premia.   1.3. UNCERTAINTY REMAINS HIGH While the recovery of the EU economy appears to be taking hold, uncertainty at the current juncture is high. The growthoutlookpresented here is thus subject to non-negligible risks. These risks go in both directions, but appear broadly balanced for2010 and 2011-12. On the upside, the rebalancing of GDP growthaway from exports and towards domestic demandcould prove stronger than assumed in the baseline.Additional support in this respect may come fromthe labour market, should it continue topositivelysurprise Œ as it has done for some time now. Thematerialisation of these risks would addto the self-sustainability of the economic recovery in the EU. Likewise, the spillover expected from thepick-up in activity in Germany to other Member States could turn out to be larger than envisaged atpresent, further strengthening the recovery.Another upside risk relates to the policy measures being taken,or yet to be implemented, to tackle high fiscal deficits and debt. These may provemore effective than assumed to date in dissipating market concerns, as well as in boosting confidence amongbusiness and consumers. As aresult, domestic demand could be stronger than expected.Indeed, research findings suggest that in countries where perceived sovereign risk ishigh, thecontractionary effect of fiscal consolidation ismilder, consistent with the notion that confidence or credibility effects help alleviate the negative impact of consolidating.(22)(21)See Reinhart, C.M.and Rogoff, K.S. (2010) 'Growth in a time of debt', American Economic Review, May 2010,Vol. 100, No. 2.(22)For a detailed discussion, see IMF (2010) ‚WorldEconomic Outlook', October 2010.On the downside, softening global demand in thesecondpart of this year and next Œbeyond that allowedfor in the baseline Œ poses a risk for EU export growth. Also on the external front, tensions regarding exchange-rate developments and globalimbalances may trigger an increase in protectionistmeasures,thus weighing on the global recovery.  Moreover, the relatively fragile financial-market situationremains a concern. Tensions in sovereign-bond markets have reappeared in someeuro-area countries of late, withthe potential for broader effects. For instance, renewed turbulencein sovereign-debt markets, or stress insystemicbanks, could give rise toadverse feedback loopsbetween the two. In addition, any softeningofbankprofits (e.g. due to a decline innet interestearnings) could undermine credit provision, withadverse consequences for economic activity. Thepossibility of a crowding-out ofprivate sectordebt by sovereign-debt issuancealso cannot be ruled out. A further downside risk relates to the fiscal consolidation underway in a number of Member States. In so far as the nature and timing of such measures is uncertain, they may weigh more on domestic demand in the short term than currently envisaged.  Graph I.1.21quantifies the various risks in termsof the possible deviation ofoutput growth from the central forecast. It shows the impact that different combinations of risks could have on euro-areaGDP growth in 2010-12, the outcomes beingweightedby the probability of their occurrence.  -5-4-3-2-101234506070809101112%upper 90%upper 70%upper 40%lower 40%lower 70%lower 90%actualcentral scenarioGraph I.1.21:Euro-area GDP forecasts-Uncertainty linkedto thebalance ofrisks27 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
Regarding the inflation outlook, risks also appear 
broadly balanced over th
e forecast horizon. On the 
one hand, higher oil and other commodity prices 

could pose an upside risk to the outlook, as could 

increases in indirect taxation and administered 

prices, to the extent that
 they are larger than 
anticipated at present. On the other hand, the 
remaining slack in the economy should keep 
inflationary pressures subdued going forward. 
1.4. ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 
The outlook presented in 
this autumn forecast 
points to the scale of the economic challenges 
policymakers need to addr
ess in order to sustain 
the recovery and ensure a return to a balanced 

growth path. As characteristics and priorities vary 

across Member States, co
untry-specific challenges 
are discussed in the accompanying country 
chapters.  
At the aggregate level, one economic challenge 
stands out as particularly urgent at this time, that of 

the need to tackle sovereign-debt tensions and 

break the negative feedback loop between 
developments in sovereign-bond markets, the 
banking sector and economic growth. Doing so 
requires action on eac
h of these fronts.  
Starting  with   sovereign-debt   markets,   a   first 
challenge is to secure the long-term sustainability 
of public finances, with the crisis of last May and 

recent developments pointi
ng to a need for some 
countries to deal with large fiscal deficits and debt 
in a credible way in the near term. 
On the banking front, the challenge is to ensure the 
soundness of the system so th
at it is in a position to 
withstand any future stress and meet increased 
credit demand, and thus support economic activity.
As for growth, the main challenge is to mitigate 
the adverse impact of the financial and economic 
crisis on potential output, along with ensuring 
a more dynamic EU economy; inter alia, by 
undertaking the necessary restructuring and 
structural reform of
product and labour markets 
under the Europe 2020 strategy. Measures aimed at 
raising employment and productivity will be 

indispensible for growth prospects and the 

sustainability of public finances further out, and 

could positively affect expectations in the short 

term. They should also help prevent a return to the 
hysteresis experienced by Europe in the past. 
A final challenge relates to adjustment within the 
euro area, with the reappearance of tensions in 

sovereign-bond markets and the differentiation in 

the speed of recovery across Member States 

reinforcing the need to correct persisting 
imbalances.  
28 Economic developments at the aggregated level 
Box I.1.7: 
Some technical elements behind the forecast
The overall cut-off date for taking new information 
into account in this
 update of the Commission's 
macroeconomic outlook was 15 November. The 

fo
recast also incorporates validated public finance 
data from Euro
stat's News Releases 157/2010, 
dated 22 October 20
10, and 170/2010, dated 
15 November 2010. 
External assumptions 
This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions
, reflecting market expectations at the 
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions 

from possible volatility during any given trading 
day, averages fr
om a 10-day reference period 
(between 1 and 12 November) were used for 
exchange and interest rate
s, and for oil prices.  
Exchange and interest rates 
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates 
was standard
ised using fixed nominal exchange 
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption 
leads to implied average USD/EUR rates of 1.33 in 
2010 and 1.39 in 2011-12. The average JPY/EUR 
rates are 116.54 in 2010 and 113.25 in 2011-12. 
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. 
Short-term interest rates for the euro area are 
derived from futures contracts. Long-term interest 
rate
s for the euro area, as well as short- and 
long-term interest rates for other Member States are 
calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the current spread be
tween the 
inte
rest rate and swap rate. In cases where no 
market instrument is
 available, the fixed spread 
vis-à-vis the euro-area interest rate is taken for both 
short- and long-term rates. As a resu
lt, short-term 
interest rates are expected to be 0.8% on average in 

2010, 1.4% in
 2011 and 1.7% in 2012 in the euro 
area. Long-term inte
rest rates are assumed to be 
2.7% on average in 2010, 2.6% in 2011 and 2.8% 
in 2012. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as 
possible, based on market conditions. According to 
futures ma
rkets, prices for Brent oil are projected to 

be on averag
e 79.9 USD/bl. in 2010, 88.9 USD/bl. 
in 2011 and 90.8 USD/bl. in
 2012. This would 
correspond to an oil price of 60.1 EUR/bl. in 2010, 

64.0 EUR/bl. in
 2011 and 65.3 EUR/bl. in 2012. 
Budgetary data  
Data up to 2009 are based on data notified by 

Me
mber States to the European Commission on 
1 October and validated
 by Eurostat on 22 October 
2010 for all Member States but Greece. Data for 
Greece we
re validated on 15 November 2010, with 
Eurostat lifting the rese
rvation on Greek data 
expressed in its News Release 55
/2010 of 22 April 
2010. Eurostat and the Helle
nic Statistical 
Authority have addressed all of the issues identified 
in the last reservation during a series of EDP 
methodological visits.  
As usual, government deficit data notified by the 
UK for the years to 2009 have
 been slightly 
amended fo
r consistency with Eurostat's view on 

the recording of UMTS licences proc
eeds.  
For the forecast, measures in s
upport of financial 
stability have been recorded in line with the 
Euro
stat decision of 15 July 2009.

 Unless 
reported otherwise by the Memb
er State concerned, 
capital inject
ions known in sufficient detail have 
been included in the forecast as fina
ncial 
transactions
, i.e. increasing the debt, but not the 
defi
cit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and 
deposits are not included as
 government 
expenditure, unless there is 
evidence that they ha
ve 
been calle
d on at the time the forecast was closed. 

Note, however, that
 loans granted to banks by the 
government, or by other entities classified in the 
government sector, usually add to government debt. 
For 2011, budgets ad
opted or presented to national 
parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For 
2012, the 'no-policy-change' assumption used in the 
forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and 
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures 
that are known in sufficient detail.  
The general government balances that are relevant 
for the Excessive Deficit Procedure may be slightly 
different from those published in the national 
accounts.
 The difference concerns settlements 
under swap
s and forward rate agreements (FRA). 
Accord
ing to ESA95 (amended by regulation No. 
2558/2001), swap
- and FRA-related flows are 
financial tran
sactions and therefore excluded from 
the calculation of the government balance. 

However, for the purposes of the excessive deficit

procedure, such flows are recorded as net interest 
expenditure. 
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output 
gaps The number of working days may differ from one 
year to anothe
r. The Commission's annual GDP 
forecasts are not adjusted for the numbe
r of 
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
 However, the working-day effect in the EU and the 
euro area is estimated to be limited over the 
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and 
unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally. The 
calcu
lation of potential growth and the output gap 
does not ad
just for working days. Since the 
working-day effect is considered as temporary, 
it should not affect the cyclical
ly-adjusted balances.

13 July 2010 on the adoption by Estonia of the eu

, in line with past practice, all 
forecast numbers (i.e. for 2010-12) for the euro-area 

aggregate include Estonia. For the sake of 
comparability, all reference forecast numbers from 
the sp
ring (2010-11) and all historical numbers for 
the euro-area aggregate ha
ve been recalculated and 
refer to EA-17 aggregate.
 Consequently, all the 
graphs in Chapter 1 displaying annual data for the

Following the decision of the Economic Policy 
Committee in December 2009, DG ECFIN has 
replaced the previously used Hodric
k-Prescott (HP) 
method fo
r detrending TFP with a new Kalman 
filter (KF) based approach which exploits the link 
between TF
P and capacity utilisation. This step has 
been
 taken to address a number of problems with 
the HP filter method, especially its tendency to 
produce imprecise estimates at the end of the 
sample period, most notably close to turning points. 
Th
e new KF method is expected to address some of 
these shortcomings. In particul
ar, it should lead to 
more precise trend TFP estimates whic
h are less 
frequently revised over time.
 As in the previous approach
es, the new method 
breaks the TFP series into a trend and a cyclical 

co
mponent. Its non-standard element is an 
additional equation that serves to extract 
information on the TFP cycle that is present in the 
data on over or underutilisation of resources in the 
economy.
 The industry capacity utilisation index 
and the economic sentiment indicator (industry and 
servic
es) are used for this purpose; both series are 
collected as pa

Business and Consumer Survey Programme.  The 

econometric equations are estimated using

2. THE IMPACT OF FISCAL CONSOLIDATION ON 
EUROPE'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 31 2.1. INTRODUCTION Public finances in the European Union have 
deteriorated sharply in r
ecent years. The aggregate 
government budget deficit in the EU increased 

markedly in the crisis, from less than 1% of GDP 

in 2007 to almost 7% of GDP in 2009. This has led 

to a strong rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio for the 
EU, to more than 80% of GDP projected in 2011 
(see Graph I.2.1). With high primary budget 
deficits and rising interest expenditure, debt-to-
GDP ratios are projected 
to increase further. 
Mechanical projections for the debt ratios based on 
unchanged-policy assumptions suggest that debt-

to-GDP ratios could rise to above 100% of GDP 

by the end of the decade if no action is taken, 

which would leave Member States ill-prepared for 

the future costs of ageing populations.  These 
concerns about the long-run sustainability of 
public finances in certain countries have fed 
tensions in government bond markets and led to 
steep increases in sovereign-bond yields for the 
Member States concerned.  
The dramatic deterioration in public finances is 
partly cyclical and the consequence of the 'normal' 
operation of so-called automatic stabilisers. One 

can expect this to be reversed when the economy 

recovers, although the financial crisis has had 
ongoing negative effects on potential growth and 
this could put further pressure on public 
finances.
(23) But the deterioration in underlying 
fiscal positions dates back to well before the crisis. 

In many countries, credit and asset price booms 

had led to improvements in fiscal positions in the 

years preceding the crisis, 
and this partly obscured 
the deterioration in underlying positions. The 
failure to fully account for the direct and indirect 
effects of strong asset prices on fiscal positions led

European governments will have to make significant fiscal retrenchments in the coming years. The 
crisis has drastically reversed the favourable economic and financial conditions that prevailed until 

2007 and made clear that windfalls accumulated during good times have not been sufficiently used to 

create room for manoeuvre when times turned bad. Very sizeable budgetary consolidation will be 

necessary in most Member States to brin
g public debt again on a declining path. 
The major concern at the present juncture is what the impact of these consolidation measures will be on 

economic growth. Given the uncertainty about the underlying strength of the economy, it is feared that 

output losses caused by large scale fiscal retrenchments could derail the recovery. Economic conditions 

matter, as model simulations indicate that fiscal multipliers are larger when more households are 

credit-constrained and when the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding. A withdrawal of 

stimulus measures and a rapid introduction of fiscal 
consolidation measures would thus be more costly 
if credit conditions remain tight and/or monetary po
licy is constrained by the interest rate floor. 
However, prolonging stimulus measures to support the recover
y and delaying consolid
ations is difficult 
for governments that now face punitive sovereign-b
ond spreads. Financial market pressures force 

governments to announce far-reaching consolidation pl
ans. Model simulations presented in this chapter 
indicate that fiscal consolidations that are credible and perceived as permanent lead to short-term falls 

in GDP and employment but these effects are significantly smaller than multipliers for temporary fiscal 

policy changes. The impact on GDP can be larger at the zero interest rate floor. But reducing 
government debt levels can give pos
itive GDP and employment effects in
 the longer run, as lower debt- 
servicing costs will create fiscal space for reducing distortionary taxes. The short and long run output 

effects depend crucially on the fiscal instrument used, and, hence, on the composition of the adjustment. 
Consolidations can be designed so as to minimise the short term costs and maximise the long run gains. 
Consolidations that reduce pension transfers by raising the retirement age can reverse the upward trend 
in age-related expenditure and simultaneously increase the labour force and raise potential output.

EU Member States implemented countercyclical fiscal measures under the common framework provided by the EuropeanEconomic Recovery Plan (EERP), launched by the European Commission back in December 2008. On average the fiscal stimulus in 2009 amounted to slightly more than1% of GDP in the EU andslightly less than that in2010, with a considerable dispersion of package sizes across Member States. The discretionary stimulus measures were called for as automatic stabilisers were considered insufficient to stem the collapse in demandfollowing the financial crisis and conventionalmonetary policy was constrained by the zero lowerbound. Discretionary fiscal policy was deemed tobe more effective in the economic crisis due to two specific conditions: the significant tightening of credit conditions, and the zero lower bound onnominal interest rates.(24)There is no broad consensus about the efficacy of discretionaryfiscal policy. Empirical evidencefrom structural VAR approaches shows that much uncertainty exists about the size of spending andtax multipliers, with estimates rangingfrom smallor even negative numbers to values larger than one.  Structural general equilibriummodels showoutput effects can be large for temporarystimuli when the zero lower bound is binding.(25) TableI.2.1 shows fiscal multipliers for temporary shocksin the Commission's QUEST model.(26) Multipliers can be large, in particular for spending shocks and targeted transfers, and are higher in thepresence of credit-constrained households and at the zero interest rate floor. This is a robust finding in macroeconomic models, as results from a model comparison exercise of various structural modelsused bypolicymaking institutions showed.(27)There is considerable agreement across models on both the absolute and relative sizes of differenttypes of fiscal multipliers. More generally, thefiscal multiplier is found tobe larger 1)for direct government spending and targeted transfers (as opposed to tax cuts and general transfers); 2) if the share of liquidity-constrained (or 'rule of thumb') and/or credit-constrained consumers is larger; 3) ifmonetary policy supports fiscal policy by (24)For an analysis of fiscal policy in the presence of creditconstrained households and a binding zero lower bound onnominal interest rates, see Roeger W., in 't Veld J.(2009),ﬁFiscal Policy with Credit Constrained Householdsﬂ,European Economy Economic Paper no.357.

If measures are part of a crediblypermanent consolidation plan, the short termimpact on economic growth cannot be gaugedfrom a simple reversal ofstimulusmultipliers, but couldbe significantly less detrimental, as will be discussed in this chapter.

This indicates the importance of(28)Non-conventional monetarypolicymeasures mayindependently support growth, but their impact on the size of fiscal multipliers is not a priori clear.

THE REQUIRED FISCAL CONSOLIDATIONEFFORTS IN MEMBER STATES There are significant differences in fiscal positions across Member States and the fiscal effortsrequired to bring positions back on a sustainable path will therefore also vary. In the short to medium run, under the Excessive DeficitProcedures the deadlines for correction and required structural efforts have been differentiated across Member States, taking into accountcountry-specific circumstances. In particular, someMember States, whose margin of budgetarymanoeuvre as determined by fiscal and macro-financial risks is considered to be large (such as Germany), have been encouraged to still run a fiscal stimulus in2010, while others have beenurged to start consolidatingduring the same year.Even when EDP final targets have been met, Member States are committed to gradually bring their deficits in line with the medium-term objectives for budgetary policy, which couldbea small deficit or surplus (depending on agreedparameters, essentially, the level of debt and the projected cost of ageing). Graph I.2.2 below showsthe structural deficits projectedfor 2010 andthe MTOs set for each of the Member States. Thedifference between these two shows the structural effort that Member States are required to make. On average for the EU as a whole, the structural effort amounts to almost 5% of GDP. Measures foreseenover the current forecast horizon go some way 33 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 towards meeting this target, but an equally large effort will berequired in the following years.Graph I.2.2:Structural deficits and MTOs-11-9-7-5-3-11BEDEEEIEEL

MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF HIGHERDEBT In many EU Member States government debt-to-GDP ratios are on a strongly increasing path. The economic and budgetaryeffects of ageing populations will put further upward pressure on future debt developments.  This raises concernsabout the longrun sustainability ofpublic finances. This sectiondiscusses the possible macroeconomiceffects ofhigher governmentdebt. A much-cited study by Reinhart and Rogoff (2010)shows evidence of a link between growth and debtwhen debt-to-GDP levels are high.(30) The authors use an extensive database of forty-four countries and about 200 years ofobservations. They findthat the growth impact of government debt isnegligible forlevels of debtbelow a threshold of90% of GDP, but above that threshold mediangrowthrates fall by 1%, and average growth fallsconsiderably more. Kumar and Woo (2010) alsofind higher debt has negative consequences for subsequentgrowth, based on growth regressionson a panel of advanced and emergingeconomies.(31)The causal interpretationof this correlation has been questioned, and it has been argued it partly reflects the fact that countries with low growth are more likely to have encountered debt sustainability problems.(32) But even if therelationship is bidirectional, concerns about the(30)Reinhart, C. M., Rogoff, K. S., 2010. "Growth in a Time of Debt", American Economic Review, May 2010, Vol. 100,No. 2. pp. 573-578.(31)Kumar, M., Woo, J., 2010. ﬁPublic Debt and Growthﬂ, IMFWorking PaperWP/10/174, July.(32)Iron, J., Bivens, J., 2010. ﬁGovernment Debt and Economic Growthﬂ, Economic Policy Institute Briefing Paper 271.  impact of higher debt on future growthcannot easily be dismissed.(33)There are three main channels through whichgovernment debt can affect long term growth:1)an effect on national savings/interest rates; 2) an effectof distortionary taxes; 3) an effecton riskpremia. Savings/interest rates The Ricardian equivalence proposition (Barro,1974) states the conditions under which government debt would not have an effect on thelevel of output in the longrun.(34) Thisproposition essentially states that no such link exists withinfinitely-lived consumers (or finitely-lived consumers with highlydeveloped bequest motives) with only non-distortionary (lump-sum) taxes anda zeroprobability that the government defaults onits debt. Under these conditionshouseholds will anticipate that taxes on government debt willeventually have to be paid. Government debt thenonly affects the composition ofspending(i.e. lower private consumption) but notthe level ofoutput. However, to the extent that the abovementioned conditions are violated in the real world, government debt canhave an effecton realeconomic activity. One departure from Ricardian equivalence relates to the assumption of infinitely-lived households(or bequest motives ofhouseholds caring about thewell-beingof their children). In an overlappinggenerations environment (where households leave no bequests to their descendents), government debtwill be associated with a less thanfully offsetting decline in private consumption and, hence,aneffect on interest rates andon the level ofoutput. However, for realistic life expectancies the effect onthe interest rate in an OLG framework is negligible.(35) In QUEST model simulations, simulated either as an infinitely-lived-agentmodel(33)Reinhart, C.M.,Rogoff, K. S., 2010. "Debt and growthrevisited", VoxEU.org, 11 August 2010.(34)Barro, R. J. (1974), "AreGovernment Bonds Net Wealth?",Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 82 (6), pp. 1095-1117.(35)Kumhof, M., Laxton D. (2009), "Fiscal Deficits and Current Account Deficits", IMF WP/09/237, show there isno difference in the interest rate response between a 50 year OLG model and an infinitely-lived-agent model. Significant interest rate effects emerge from OLG models only with very short time horizons, but this leads tocounterfactual implications of very high marginal propensity to consume out of financial wealth. Empirical estimates suggest values in the range between 0.02 and 0.04 which is roughly in the range of models with planninghorizons above 50 years.34 Economic developments at the aggregated levelor as anOLG model with a realistic lifeexpectancy of 50 years, the savings channelof government debt isnegligible.(36)Distortionary taxation Another departure fromthe Ricardian equivalence proposition relates to the assumption of lump-sumtaxation. Financing of deficits via distortionarytaxes leads toa negative impact of debt on GDP. Higher government debt implies higher interestcharges andgovernment revenuewill need to behigher (for given expenditure levels) to service this debt. The larger thedistortionsof taxes are, the larger  the negative effect onpotential GDP.  In the QUEST model the distortions are largest forcorporate profit taxes, due totheir negative impact on capital accumulation. Labour taxes distort employment decisions and have a negative impact on potentialoutput. Property taxes on housing discourage residentialinvestmentbut have no direct negative impact on other factors ofproduction and have smaller negative long runoutput effects. Taxes on consumption (VAT) areleast distortionary in the model. The servicing costs associated with higher debt also havedistributional consequenceswhichdepend on the tax instrument used. Labour incometaxes mostly hit workers, and constrained 'rule ofthumb' households withno other sources of income will be most affected. Corporate profit taxes hurt capital owners most, but also reduce employment and affectworkers. Consumption taxes depress consumption of allincomegroups. Risk premia Empirical evidence suggests that higher government debt is associated with an increase in real interest rates on government bonds. Laubach(2009)reports an effect rangingfrom a 1 to6 basispoints increase in interest rates on government bonds for a 1 pp. increase of the government debt-to-GDP ratio.(37) There is (36)In the model simulations presented here only a fraction ofhouseholds has an infinite planning horizon. Liquidityconstrained households have a zero planning horizon and credit (or collateral) constrained households have an effective planning horizon of about 10 years. However,what matters is that savers (no matter how large their sharein the total population) have an infinite planning horizon.Mankiw, N.G. (2000), The Savers-Spenders Theory ofFiscal Policy,American Economic Review 90(2): 120-25.(37)Laubach, T, 2009. "New evidence on the interest rate effects of budget deficits and debt".Journal of the European Economic Association,7(4): 858-85.however no consensus on whether this increase isconfined to government bonds or whether it affects the general level of interest rates in the respective country. It may well be that for countries which rely heavily on foreign financing of investment anincrease ingovernment debt could lead toa general increase in the risk premium for thecurrency and raise interest rates for bothgovernment and private bonds. However, evidencefor the US shows that an increase in Treasury debt heldby the public leads to a decline in yield spread of AAA corporate debt over Treasuries.(38) This suggests that an increase in government debt may raise the sovereign spread but reduces the spreadbetween government and corporate bonds.(39)Graph I.2.3:10ygovernment-bondyields,selected Member States23456789101112Jan-08Jul-08Jan-09Jul-09Jan-10Jul-10DEFRITESNLIRLGRBEPT% (monthlyaverages)Graph I.2.3 shows 10-year government-bondyields of selected Member States.

The rise in taxes cannot avoid the debt-to-GDP ratio increasing bymore than 10 pps.

THE MACRO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF FISCAL CONSOLIDATIONS This section explores the macroeconomiceffectsof permanent consolidations, using theCommission's QUEST model. First, permanentchanges in individual revenue and expenditureinstruments are considered separately to highlighttheir different impacts on the economy. The effectsof a credible general 'across-the-board' fiscal consolidationis then compared to an alternative where credibility is lacking and agents do initiallynotbelieve consolidation measures are permanent. The effect of the zero interest rate floor isconsidered, as well as the effects in case of a synchronised global consolidation. Finally, targeted consolidations combining expenditure cuts with tax cuts are shown.2.4.1.By expenditure and revenue instrument The impact of fiscal consolidations depends crucially on their composition. Graph I.2.5 showsthe effects for individualrevenue and expenditureinstruments. Scenarios are presented as standardisedreductions in the ex-ante government deficit-to-GDP ratio by 1 pp. In each scenario thisis achieved by an adjustment in the respective instrument that equals ex-ante 1% of (baseline) GDP.(40)With the gradual de-cumulation ofgovernment debt, lower interest payments create space for reductions in labour taxes, and this raisesemployment and boosts GDP in the medium and long run.Expenditure measures On the expenditure side, the main difference isbetween productive and unproductivespending. Government investment has a productivity-raisingeffect and a permanent reduction leads to the largest GDP losses, in both the short and long run.Transfers are unproductive in the model andonly serve distributional purposes. Reducing such transfers Œ and loweringdistortionary labour taxes in the medium/long run Œ leads rapidly to positive output effects in the model. However, cuts intransfers hit proportionally more those constrained 'rule of thumb' households who are more dependenton such transfers and have limitedaccess to financial markets. Consumption of thosehouseholds declines sharply. An example ofa transfer shock is a reduction in pension benefits,but an alternative option of pension reformthatraises the retirement age is discussed in Box I.2.2. Governmentpurchases have no productivity-raising effect and a reduction in this instrument hasonly a short-term negative GDP effect when it is compensatedby cuts in labour taxes in the medium/long run.(40)At first consolidations in the EU only are considered.The model assumes a continuing relevance of credit constraintsin the economy. The labour tax rule that stabilises debt in the model is turned off in the first 15 years and then targets a 25 pps. lower debt-to-GDP ratio, consistent with a 1% ofGDP permanent reduction in the government deficit andthe assumptions on nominal growthrates in the model. The sovereign risk premium declines by75 bps. in the long run.37 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Graph I.2.5a:Government purchases-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.60123456789102030%yearsGraph I.2.5b:Government investment-3.0-2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00123456789102030%yearsGraph I.2.5c:Government wages-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20123456789102030%yearsGraph I.2.5d:Government transfers-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.60.80123456789102030%yearsGraph I.2.5e:Consumption taxes-0.2-0.10.00.10.20.30.40123456789102030%yearsGraph I.2.5f:Property taxes-0.3-0.2-0.10.00.10.20.30123456789102030%yearsGraph I.2.5g:Labour incometaxes-0.3-0.2-0.10.00.10.20.30.40123456789102030%yearsGraph I.2.5h:Corporate profittaxes-1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00123456789102030%yearsGraph I.2.5:GDP impact of 1% of GDP fiscal consolidation38 Economic developments at the aggregated levelBox I.2.2:Pension reform: raising the retirement ageExpenditures on age-related support will increase significantly over the comingyears. Based oncurrent policies, for the EU27, age-related expenditure (pension provision, health care andlong-term care)is set to increase by 4½% of GDP between 2010 and 2060. These growing costs will put further pressure on the long run sustainability of fiscal balances.Reforms in the area of pension provisions are therefore considered priority for fiscalconsolidation and long-term sustainability.Reforms that reduce pension benefits by cutting average replacement rates will decrease transferpayments to households, andyield positive output effects in the medium term, as shown in Graph 1.2.5.d. An alternative option of pension reform is raising the statutory retirement age, and this is thepathtaken by manymember states (e.g. inGermany from 65 to 67, in France from 60 to 62). Such reforms can have both favourable public finance implications and positive labour market effects. By reducing the number of people entitledto a state pension, they reduce public transfers paid to households and, as more workers stay longer in employment, raise social security contributions. The improvement in public finances helps to bring down government debtand lower government interest payments will then create additional fiscalspace in the future that could be used for reducingdistortionary taxes. By extending working lives the reforms increase the labour force, put downwardpressure on wages and raise the employment rate. This can give a direct boost to potential output and raise growth over a prolonged period. A model simulation can illustrate the effects of lifting the retirement age. In this scenario thenumber of pensioners are graduallyreduced by 10%, roughlycorresponding to an increase inthe age of retirement bytwo years, phased in overa 10-year period. After a decade the pension rate has fallen byalmost 2 pps. The reform puts downward pressure on wages and raises employment. The employment rate increases by1½ pps. after 10 years, and almost 2 pps. in the long run.(1) There is initially a negative impact on consumption of constrained households as wages decline, but the positiveemployment effect raises (1)Note that this is not based on anyexogenousassumption on the un/employment status during theextended working lives, and indeed, during thetransition there may be a small increase in the share of unemployment benefit recipients.permanent income, and consumption of non-constrained households rises. Aggregateconsumption and corporate investment are higherafter ten years. Government budget balancesimprove due to lower transfer payments and the debt-to-GDP ratio declines by14 pps., and more than 30 pps. in the long run.  The scenario assumes average productivityis not affected by the reform. A larger share of older workers in the labour force may reduce average labour productivity, but it is unlikely that this effect would eliminate the long run GDP gains from this reform.

Lowering government wages however has a direct 
impact on aggregate GDP as defined in the 

national accounts.
(41) Public sector wage cuts put 
downward pressure on wages in the private sector 

(spillover) and the reduction in incomes leads to 

a fall in consumption. This again particularly hits 

constrained households who depend on current 

disposable income for their consumption 
expenditure and their consumption falls. Lower 
wages in the private sector help to boost 
competitiveness though, and this, as well as 
expectations of lower future taxes, raises 
employment. These effects gradually increase 
value added in the private sector and more than 
offset the reduction in the public sector in 
aggregate GDP.
(42)Revenue measures Raising taxes has generally negative short and long 

term output effects, but in these scenarios tax 

increases are compensate
d in the long run by 

reductions in labour taxes as the debt burden 

declines. Thus the scenarios show the dynamic 

adjustment to partial tax shifts from labour taxes, 
to the extent that this is made possible by lower 
debt in the steady state.  
Short-term effects of tax increases depend partly 
on adjustment costs in capital and labour. An 
increase in corporate profit tax may, with relatively 
high adjustment costs on capital, only have 
a relatively small short-term impact but GDP 

losses build up over following years as investment 

is depressed and the capital stock declines. 

It generates the largest long-run GDP loss of all 

tax-based consolidations. A consolidation through 
labour taxes also yields an initial GDP loss. In the 
long run, however, labour taxes can be reduced 
due to the fiscal space th
at becomes available as 
a result of the reduction in government debt, and 

GDP eventually turns positive. Taxes on 
consumption and housing property are less 

distortionary in the model. Increasing these taxes, 

compensated by future reductions in labour taxes, 
(41) Output of general government is valued at costs and 
a government wage cut implies a decrease of value-added 
and GDP not only in nominal terms, but, in the absence of 
other productivity measures for government services, also 
in volume terms. This is a pure accounting effect on the 
definition of GDP and does not in itself reflect any 
reduction in government services
 (Roeger and in 't Veld, 
2010). Using alternative productivity measures can partly 
overcome this effect, but these have not yet been widely 
implemented.  
(42) See also the simulations reported in Box I.2.3 of German 
fiscal consolidation measures, which rely heavily on 

reducing the governme
nt wage bill. yields smaller short term negative impacts, with 
GDP falling by around 0.2% below base. Output 

gradually recovers and in the long run there are 

positive output gains.  
Tax increases also have different distributional 
consequences. Increases in labour taxes hit the 
consumption of constrained 'rule of thumb' 
households proportionally harder. Increases in 

consumption taxes affect all households, but 

constrained households are not able to smooth 

their consumption in anticipation of lower future 

taxes and are more affected. Property taxes reduce 
residential investment of credit-constrained and 
unconstrained households and lead to 
a permanently lower housing stock. GDP as 
defined in national accounts falls, as output of 
services of owner-occupied dwellings declines. 
In the medium to long run this is offset by an 
increase in production due to the reduction in 
labour taxes.  
2.4.2. Across-the-board expenditure- and 
revenue-based consolidation scenario 
The previous section looked at individual 

instruments, this section describes the 

macroeconomic effect
s and the dynamic 
adjustment to an across-
the-board consolidation, 
through an adjustment in spending and taxes, 

roughly proportionally to their respective shares in 
the government budget.
(43)The combined reduction in spending and increase 

in taxes lowers output on impact, by approximately 
0.3% in the first year (Graph I.2.6). It leads to 
a gradual decline in the stock of debt, and the costs 
of servicing this debt also fall. The additional 
fiscal space that this creates is used to gradually 
reduce labour income taxes, offsetting the initial 

increase in taxes that was part of the consolidation 

package. In the long run, labour taxes are lower 

than in the no-consolidation baseline, and this 

boosts employment and output. 
(43) On the expenditure side cuts
 in transfers of 0.15
% of 
(b
aseline) GDP, government wages 0.1%, government 
employment 0.1%, government
 pu
rchases 0.1% and in 
government investment 0.05%
, and on the revenue side 
increases of 0.2% of GDP in labour taxes and VAT each, 
and 0.05% in corporate profit taxes and house property 
taxes. The tax rule targets a 25 pps. lower debt-t
o-GDP 
ratio in the long run, similar as described above.

Higher taxes on labour income (in the short run) and taxes on consumption further depress consumption spending. But whileemployment initially declines, lower wages gradually stimulate employment growth in the private sector as competitiveness improves, and consumption also gradually recovers. The currentaccount improves as imports decline due to lower domestic demand and exports increase.Consolidations when lacking credibility The scenarios shown here assume the measures arepart of a credible permanent consolidation plan, which is believedby agents to permanently reduce government debt and leads to anticipationsofa lower taxburden in the future. Consolidation measures that lack this credibility can have more detrimental effects, as suggested by the difference between the impact of permanent governmentspending shocks shown in the previous section andthe multipliers for temporary fiscal shocksreportedin Table I.2.1. The second scenario shown inGraph I.2.6 assumes that the consolidation measures lack credibility in the first two years and are instead perceived as temporary. Only after the second year do the measures gain credibility andagents start to believe the consolidation is permanent. This initial credibility gap leads toGDP losses in the first two years that are more than twice as large, while the long term positive effects are delayed till later.(44) This indicates the importance of designing fully credibleconsolidation measures. Consolidations that are notperceived as permanent but expected to be reversed at a later stage may have significantly larger output and employment costs. Asa consequence, enacting legislation or changes inlegislation that will takeeffect even several years down the road could be very useful to maximise the benefits from often painful reforms. (44)A multiplier of 0.7 is roughly the average of fiscal multipliers of temporary shocks in spending and tax components. See Table I.2.1 41 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
Box I.2.3: 
Country-specific effects of consolidation and the German package
The scenarios discussed in this chapter treat the EU 
as one aggregate region. However, there is 
a generally agreed need for differentiation across 
Me
mber States. As shown in section I.2.2, there are 
significant differences in the order of magnitude of 
the re
quired structural consolidation effort across 
Me
mber States. The macro-economic effects of 
a given fiscal consolidation will also be different 
across countries. Model simulations described in 
this chapter give an indication of likely 
macroeconomic impacts of 
consolidations, but the 
scenarios are of an illustrative na
ture, stylised with 
a constant
 permanent profile, and based on 

simulations of a model of the EU and the rest of the 
world as aggregate regions. One important aspect 
in which consolidations in a single Member State 
differ from the scenarios shown here is the 
potential monetary polic
y response. Monetary 
policy is not likely to be able to support 
a consolidation in a single euro-area me
mber state 
to the same degree, and the im
pact will thus be 
more closely related to those shown here at the zero 
intere
st rate floor. However, one has to keep in 
mi
nd that there is a euro-area-wide need for fiscal 
consolidation and this argum
ent relates more to the 
extent
 that fiscal retrenchments will be asymmetric. 
The degree of openness is another important factor 
behind di
fferences in fiscal multipliers. Small open 
economies will have a smaller negative GDP 
impact as the reduction in dema
nd will have 
a larger effect on imports. In the model version 
simu
lated here it is assu
med government debt is 
held by domestic residents, which is for individual 

euro-area member states certainly not a valid 
assumption. The fact that a large share of 
government debt is held abroad means there are 
current account implications, as illustrate
d in 
Box 1.2.1. However, the costs of consolidations 
will still have to be borne by domestic resident
s.  To illustrate the effect
s of consolidation plans in an 
individual Member State, Graph 1 below shows 
results from a QUEST model simulation of th
e 
Ge
rman consolidation measures.

government spending: the largest share of the 
intended EUR 32.1 bn deficit reduction by 2014 
shall come
 from lower expenditure. The package is 
split over 4 years, but frontloaded with 60% of the 
volume to be impl
emented in 2011-12.
(2)The items on the expenditure side take 

predominantly the character of lower government 
employment, government wages and
unemployment benefits. These measures re
duce the 
disposable income of and the demand from 
liquidity-constrained households. The measures 
have however a positive supply-side effect, 

reducing reservation wages in the private sector 
and raising labour supply. The reduction of 
government consumption 
has a direct negative 
impact on aggregate demand, but all these 
me
asures also reduce expected future tax liabilities. 
Most revenue-side items take the form of lump-
sum taxes Œ equivalent to a reduction of lump-sum 
transfers Œ for non-constrained intertemporally 
optimising households that own the firms and 
receive the fi
rms' profits. In particular it is assumed 
that taxes imposed on the nuclear energy sector are 
non-distortive as it only ta
xes rents accruing to 
firms from extending the time of operation of 
existing nuclear plants. Lump-sum taxes affect 
households' wealth without distorting their 
investment and consumption decisions. Only the 
planned bank levy is modelled as a distortionary
 measure that is passed on to firms and households, 
raising financing costs and leading to a fall in 
corporate and housing investment. Based on the 
amount of outstanding bank credit, firms are 
assumed to pay 60% and households 40% of the 
EUR 2 billion extr
a revenue.  
The consolidation package achieves a la
sting fiscal 
consolidation. The government deficit declines by 
1.0% of GDP by 2014 and public debt by 9% of 
GDP after 10 and 21% of GDP after 20 years. The 
consolidation has positive output effects in the 
medium to long run. Real output is 0.1% above the 
no-consolidation baseline after 10 years and 0.8% 
after 20 years. The positive medium and long te
rm 
effect
s of consolidation come with costs in the 
short to medium term but
 the negative GDP impact 
is small. In fact, th
e 2.5% reduction in public wages 
has a direct impact on GDP as measured in national 

accounts of almost
 0.2%, and this is a pure 
accounting effect, not rela
ted to any reduction in 
government services.  
(2) It should be noted that in 2010 there is still a sizeable 
fiscal stimulus. 
(Continued on the next page) 
42 Economic developments at the aggregated levelBox (continued) Value-added in the privatesector increaseson impact. The reduction in publicemployment, publicwages and reservation wages puts downward pressure on realwages and the resulting wagemoderation leads to falling production costs and lower product prices. Employment is shifted from the public sector to the private sector. The average multiplier of the consolidation on real GDP isaround 0.4-0.5 in the first year(2011) and drops to around 0.2 in 2014, not dissimilar to the multiplier reported in the chapter for the EU as a whole. Germany's competitiveness improves and net exportsincrease as a consequence, which further improves the country's current account. In the context of intra-euro-area current-account imbalances, improving Germany'strade competitiveness increases the pressure on other euro-area economies to follow with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.Graph 1a:GDP and value-added private sector-0.40.00.40.81.21.6101112131415161718192030%Real GDPValue added in private sectoryearsGraph 1b:Government debt to GDP ratio-30-20-100101112131415161718192030% of GDPyearsGraph 1:Impact of German consolidation measuresConsolidation when interest rates are near zerointerest rate floor Graph I.2.7a:EU only-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40123456789102030%GDPGDP zlbyearsGraph I.2.7b:Global consolidation -0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40123456789102030%GDPGDP zlbyearsGraph I.2.7:Impactof 1%of GDP fiscal consolidation: effectof zero interest rate floor andsynchronisation43 It is assumed in the above scenario that monetarypolicy operates in normal fashion, and centralbanks cut interest rates in response tonegative output and inflation gaps. However, at presentpolicy rates in the euro area and in many other economies are near the zero interest rate floor. Ifmonetary policy is constrained by this zero lower bound for nominal interest rates the impact onGDP can be larger. The left hand panel of GraphI.2.7 illustrates this for the same across-the-board consolidation package as described above, whenpolicy rates are near the zero lower bound.(45) The GDP impact in the first year rises from 0.3 to 0.5.This suggestsfiscal consolidations could be more painful in the short term when policy rates are near the zero interest rate floor. (45)In this scenario, the Taylor type interest rate reaction function is switched off for one year and gradually reactivated in following periods. As noted earlier, even at the zero interest rate floor, central banks can still resort to non-conventional monetary policymeasures.European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
Consolidations when globally synchronised The scenarios described above relate to 
consolidations in the European Union alone. 

However, at present ma
ny countries around the 
world face the need to
 consolidate and are 
embarking on a simultaneous fiscal retrenchment. 

The negative spill-over effects of this could further 
raise the costs of fiscal retrenchments. The right 
hand panel in Graph I.2.7 illustrates this. The GDP 
impact of the same 1% of GDP consolidation rises 
in the first year from 0.3 to 0.4 in case not only the 
EU embarks on consolidation, but if this is done 
across the world (global consolidation). The 
effects become even larger when central banks are 
constrained by the zero interest rate floor. In this 

case the GDP impact rises from 0.5 to 0.7. The 

larger impact effect is due to two factors. First, the 

fiscal consolidation abroad reduces demand for EU 

exports and this has a negative impact on EU GDP. 
Second, in case of only th
e EU consolidating, the 
depreciation vis-à-vis the (non-consolidating) rest 

of the world can play a cushioning role in the short 
term. In case of a synchronised global 

consolidation, the absen
ce of such a cushioning 
exchange rate depreciation 
implies a larger short- 
term GDP impact.  
In the medium/long run the positive demand 
spillovers from the rest of the world boost EU 
GDP by more. The second channel mentioned 
above also reverses the effects. The depreciation in 
the case of the EU acting 
alone has only a short- 
term mitigating output effect, but a negative effect 

on output in the medium term. Hence, the short- 
term pain is larger, but the medium- and long-term 

effects are more positive under a global 

consolidation.  
2.4.3. Fiscal consolidations combined with tax 
reform The differences in short- and long-run effects of 

different instruments indicate a consolidation 

package can be designed that minimises the short 

term losses in GDP and maximises the long run 

gains. Such a package coul
d consist of reductions 
in unproductive spending 
(purchases, transfers) 
and increases in the least distortionary taxes 
(consumption, housing), while at the same time 
reducing the most distortionary taxes (on labour 
and capital). This would combine the positive 
effects of structural reforms raising potential 
output with the necessary
 fiscal retrenchment. 
Graph I.2.8 shows an example of such a package 

which combines selective tax increases and 
expenditure cuts with reductions in distortionary 
taxes, and compares this to the 'across-the-board' 
consolidation scenario de
scribed in the previous 
section.
(46) Reducing tax distortions boosts 
employment   and    helps     to    minimise  the 
short-term  output  costs  of    the    consolidation. 

The decline in private consumption is more 

persistent, as consumption taxes are raised by more 

to finance the labour tax cut, but positive 
employment effects boost incomes and mitigate 
the impact on consumption in the medium run. The 
fall in GDP is short-lived and output rises above 
baseline in following years. Corporate investment 
increases as corporate profit taxes are reduced, 
raising capital accumulation and boosting potential 
output. This scenario illustrates that composition 
matters: well-designed measures that combine 

expenditure cuts with tax cuts can reduce the 

negative effects of fiscal consolidations on GDP 

and raise output by more in the long run. 
(46) On the expenditure side cuts in transfers of 0.3% of 
(b
aseline) GDP, government wages, employment and 
purchases of 0.1% each, and on the revenue side increa
ses of 0.5% of GDP in consumption and property taxes and 
reductions of 0.3% each in 
labour and corporate profit 
taxes.  44 Economic developments at the aggregated levelGraph I.2.8a:GDP -0.4-0.20.00.20.40.60.80123456789102030%GDPGDP tax reformyearsGraph I.2.8c:Employment-0.4-0.20.00.20.40123456789102030%EmploymentEmployment tax reformyearsGraph I.2.8b:Consumption-0.40.00.40.81.21.60123456789102030%ConsumptionConsumption tax reformyearsGraph I.2.8d:Debt toGDP ratio-30-20-1000123456789102030pps.Debt/GDPDebt/GDP tax reformyearsGraph I.2.8:Impact of 1%of GDP fiscal consolidation combined with tax reform2.5. CONCLUSIONS European governments will be undertaking extensive fiscal consolidations in the coming years to reverse persistently high primary deficits andtrend increases in debt-to-GDP ratios. Somecountries already face punitive sovereign-bond spreads and are forced to take immediate and rapidaction. Model simulationspresented in this chapter show fiscal consolidation measures are likely tohave negative GDP and employment effects in theshort run. But these effects can become positive inthe medium run by reducing government interestpayments and creating space for future tax reductions and so raise potentialoutput.The challenge policymakers now face is to design consolidation measures in sucha way as to minimise the short-run costs and maximise the long-run gains. Model simulations suggest fourbroad lessons. First, full credibility of the permanent nature of the consolidation plans isimportant. If economic agents were to believe measures would be reversedin the future, outputlosses could be considerably larger. This indicates consolidations should be part of a wideragendathat deals convincingly with long-runsustainability ofpublic finances, external imbalances and promoting long-rungrowthpotential. Enacting changes in legislation, even ifonly taking effect several years down the road, could helpmaximise the benefits from often painful reforms. Second, if monetary policy is ableto support the economy by reducing interest rates in response tothe fiscal retrenchments, this couldsignificantly reduce the negative short-term impact on output and employment. In this context, it isalso important that the financial systemis working properly so as to pass the effects of low policy rates through to lending rates and other creditconditions. Third, the composition of consolidation measures should focus on those measures thatmaximise long-runoutput effects. Reductions inunproductive spending, such as governmentpurchases and transfers, yield generally the largestlong-term gains inGDP, but measures that rely too much on instruments like cuts in transfers canhave distributional consequences and may undermine the long-run credibility of consolidation packages. If one were to resort to revenuemeasures, the focus should be on shifting the burden towards less distortionary taxes, like consumption and property taxes. Finally, consolidations shouldaddress the underlying fiscal problem of increasing age-related expenditure. Pension reform that raises the retirement age can achieve these objectivesby reducing transfer payments and simultaneously increase potential output. 45 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
Box I.2.4: 
Non-Keynesian effects of fiscal
 consolidations
Th
e simulations reported here show fiscal 
consolidations can have 
positive output effects in 
the long run, but they generally have contractionary 
effects in the short run. The possibility that fiscal 
cons
olidations may in certain cases have 
expa
nsionary effects already 
in the short run
 has 
attracted some attention among economists.  The 
impetus was given by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990), 
who, looking at the fiscal consolidations that 
occu
rred in Denmark in 1983-86 and in Ireland in 
1987-89, documented in both cases an acceleration 
in growth just after governments put in place 
measures that drastically reduced budget deficit. 

This has gi
ven rise to a literature on so-called 
non-Keynesian
 effects of fiscal consolidations.
(1)
Theoretical considerations  
Certain theoretical considerations can rationalise 
non-Keynesian
 effects. A permanent consolidation 
that credibly reduces public sector borrowing may 
lead to an increase in aggregate consumption 
al
ready in the short run if it generates expectations 
of permanently lower future distortionary taxes and 
lead to an expected increase in perm
anent incomes, 
and if the sh
are of unconstrained consumers is 
sufficiently high. For these confidence and wealth 
effects the role
 of consumers™ expectations 
becomes crucial in determining the impact
 of fiscal 
consolid
ations on the short-run behaviour of 

consumption and such impact, in turn
, could be 
affected by the size of consolidations and by the 
state of public
 finances.

In the model simulations reported in this chapter,

constrained and cannot smooth their consumption 

in this way.
 Consolidation can exert downward 
pressure on
 wages and this may boost profits and 

investment spending. But on the whole,
 these 
effects are not strong enough to offset in the 
simulations the im
mediate negative impact of the 
fiscal consolidatio
n on GDP, and do not generate 
a non-Keynesian effects in the short run. Although 
an effect on sovereign risk premia
 is present in the 
simulations, debt decumulates only gradually, 
delaying the significance of this
 effect. But if 
cons
olidations were to eliminate risk premia that 
had arisen due to higher indebtedness,
 as described 
in Box I.2.1, then exogenous changes in such risk 
premia would yi
eld larger GDP gains in the model. 
Empirical evidence 
There is a large empirical literature investigating 
ep
isodes of expansionary fiscal consolidations. 
Different methodologies have been adopted in 
these case studies, but mo
st studies have focussed 
on chan
ges in the primary cyclically-adjusted 

budget balance to identify discretionary 
consolid
ation periods.  
A number of results
 are common to almost all 
studies:   

1) There have been episodes of fiscal 
consolid
ations that coincided with expansionary 
effects. (3) Alesina, A., S. Ardagna, R. Perotti, and 
F. Schiantarelli, (2002), ‚Fiscal policy, profits, and

2) Such coinciding expansionary effects are more 
likely for cons
olidations leading to a permanent 
reduction
 in debt (‚successful™). 
3) But the policy envi
ronment in which fiscal 
consolidations are undertaken matters. In 
particul
ar, monetary policy, exchange rate and 
wage policies accompanying consolidations have 
played cushioning roles.
(1)
Several papers find composition matters, with 
expe
nditure cuts rather than tax increases having 
a higher probability of showing expansionary 
effects. Other studies found th
at fiscal adjustments 
with expans
ionary effects are more likely when the 
size of cons
olidation is large (Giavazzi and Pagano, 
1996). There are also studies that empha
sise the 
initial stat
e of public finances, with consolidations 
more likely to have non-Keynesian effects when 
they occur in countrie
s and periods where debt-to-
GD
P ratios are high (Alesina and Ardagna, 1998, 
Pero
tti, 1999). This may suggest risk premia effects 
play a role
. 
Although these empirical studies can shed light on 
several features of fiscal consolidation episodes, 
there are a numbe
r of reasons why the results 
arising from such cross-country empirical analyses 

need to be interpreted with caution. Fi
rst, there are 
problems in measuring and defining fiscal 
consolidation episodes. In particular, relying on 
deficit-based measures tends to exclude fiscal 

reforms with a limited impact on current budget 
balances but potentially large effect
s on long-term 
public finances and on perman
ent income, such as 
pension reforms.
 Second, it is difficult to take 
properly into account other relevant factors, such as 
developments
 in monetary and exchange rate 
policies, which mi
ght have driven positive short 
run growth effect
s. Third, when interpreting the

Relevance at current juncture 
It is clear from this literature that, although 
generally fiscal consolidations have had 
contractionary output effects, there have been 
exceptions to this rule. The question though is 
whethe
r cushioning factors can play a role at the 
cu
rrent juncture. Historically, expansionary 
epis
odes have often been associated with real 
depreciations, achieved either through monetary 

policy actions or th
rough wage moderation that 
improved competitiveness. A decline in the 
exchange rate could cushion the short term impact 
on growth, but this is not a channel that ca
n be 
relied up
on at present given the synchronisation of 
consolidation efforts globally and the general 
uncertainty that surrounds
 global exchange rate 
developments. Monetary policy is at
 the current 
junctu
re constrained by the zero interest rate floor, 
which

 GD
P effects of fiscal changes. 
Simultaneous structural refo
rms could however 
play an
 important supporting role. The case of 

Denmark in the 1980s illustrates the role of wage 
moderation. Fiscal consolidatio
n coincided with not 
only wi
de-ranging financial liberalisation, but also 
with the abolition of automatic indexation,
 which 
led to an improvement in competitiveness. This 
suggests cons
olidations that are accompanied by 
co
mprehensive structural reforms in labour and 
product markets that boost domestic demand and 
improve competitiveness can help to soften the 
negative impact of fiscal consolidations. 
3. RESTORING GROWTH POTENTIAL IN THE EU: THE 
ROLE OF PRODUCT AND LABOUR MARKET REFORMS 
48 Historical evidence shows that economic recoveries after financial crises tend to be slow and sluggish; 
typically, the need for financial deleveraging, demands for higher
 risk premia, inevitable fiscal 
consolidation to restore sustainable public finances and persistent labour market weaknesses weigh on 

growth for a prolonged period of time. All these factors must be expected to impact on potential growth 
in the EU over the coming decade. Without bold reforms, a medium-term scenario presented in this 
chapter projects the average potential growth rate over the period 2011-2020 to be around 1½% in the 
EU27. This is significantly lower than the rates observed in the EU in the past two decades, which 

already were much lower than those recorded in the US. Over the forecast horizon (until 2012), 

potential growth in the EU27 is expected to particularly suffer from the lower utilisation of labour, 

manifest in a rise in structural unemployment, and slow capital accumulation due to historically low 

investment rates in the wake of the crisis. This goes hand-in-hand with slow total factor productivity 
growth, only gradually recovering from the crisis 
and converging to the lacklustre pre-crisis path. 
The chapter then discusses the potential of different structural reforms to boost long-run growth 
performance as well as their capacity to support th
e ongoing recovery. A stylised comprehensive reform 
scenario, which combines effects of 
several structural reforms, demons
trates that reforms can generate 
significant gains in terms of additional output and employment, a small part of which materialises 

already relatively soon following their implementation. It emphasises that while some reforms indeed 
carry non-negligible short-run budgetary or adjustment costs, positive effects of others come with 
a relatively short delay. Overall, 
it needs to be recognise
d, however, that the short-run effects of 
structural reforms are ambiguous. In practise, the magnitude of reform effects will be closely tied to the 

credibility of reform a
nnouncements and capability of Member States 
to accelerate their reform agendas. In addition, the existing diversity among 
the EU countries regarding their macro-structural 
bottlenecks calls for a differen
tiated approach when designing 
appropriate reform agendas. 
3.1. INTRODUCTION The economic and financial crisis has caused 
a significant drop in the level of potential output. 

According to the estimates of the European 

Commission (2009)
(47), the loss of potential output 
in the EU accumulates to around 4% in the 

medium run. The present forecast does not suggest 

that these losses can be quickly recovered as the 

crisis leaves a heavy le
gacy on trend growth.  
Historical evidence suggests that economic 

recoveries after financial crises tend to be slow and 

sluggish. The typical factors weighing on growth, 

such as the need for financial deleveraging and 

fiscal consolidation, demands for higher risk 

premia, and persistent weaknesses in the labour 

market, must be expected to be at work again. 
From a supply-side perspective, potential growth 
in the EU27 is expected to
 particularly suffer from

economic and fi
nancial crisis on potential output",

the lower use of labour and slower capital 
accumulation over the forecast horizon (2010-12); 

as the evidence presented below will suggest, in 

the absence of policy chan
ge the average potential 
growth rate over the period 2011-20 may only 

amount to about 1½%.    
Growth-enhancing structural reforms are thus now 
needed more than ever 
to address the existing 
"bottlenecks" to growth and stimulate the 

adjustment capacity of the economy.  A substantial 

part of their effects typically materialises only over 

the medium- to long-run. Many reforms involve 
fairly long implementation lags due to 
administrative, institutional or policymaking 
constraints. Once implemented, the effects of 
reforms often trickle gradually into the real 
economy, as it takes several years before the 
economy converges to the new steady state. Some 

reforms may even have a negative impact on 

economic activity in the short-run due to 

adjustment costs of resource reallocation in the 

economy. Last but not leas
t, there may also be 
upfront budgetary costs of certain growth-
Economic developments at the aggregated level 
enhancing reforms that need to be borne in the 
short-run. Some structural reform measures, nevertheless, 
have a material impact 
already within the short 
term. While some reforms indeed carry short-run 

budgetary or adjustment costs, positive effects of 
others come with a relatively short delay and can 
have non-negligible macroeconomic effects 

already in the early period after their 
implementation. Structural
 reforms also contribute 
to generating favourable expectations of future 

growth and facilitate the necessary fiscal 
consolidation. The magnitude of these effects is, 
however, closely tied to the credibility of the 
reform announcements and depends on the 
capability of Member Stat
es to accelerate their reforms agenda, together with implementation 

lags. 
This chapter explores the potential of structural 
reforms in product and labour markets to affect the 
growth outlook in the EU over the following 

decade, putting emphasis on their time profile and 

capacity to contribute to the ongoing recovery. It is 

structured in the following way. The next section 

discusses the main growth drivers in the EU and 
the outlook for potential growth in the short- to 
medium-run in the EU and 
the euro area in the 
absence of policy changes. Section 3 then provides 
a broad assessment, largely based on multipliers 

from modelling simulations, of the potential short- 

to medium-run effects of 
structural reforms and 
section 4 concludes. 
3.2. GROWTH PROSPECTS IN THE EU IN THE 
SHORT TO MEDIUM RUN The lacklustre growth perf
ormance in the EU over the past decade suggests that there are various 

structural weaknesses, 
market distortions and 

"bottlenecks", which hold back the potential for 

growth in Europe. Standard growth accounting 

reveals that before the crisis (2001-07) labour 
productivity was the main driving force behind 
growth, while improved labour utilisation and the 
increase in working-age pop
ulation only accounted 
for around one fourth of to
tal growth; in particular, 
decreasing labour market participation of youth 
and prime-age men and a reduction in hours 
worked per persons were dragging growth down in 
the EU27 (see graph I.3.1). The crisis lead to 

a contraction of GDP, w
ith a sharp increase in 
unemployment and a drop in total factor 
productivity (TFP), mostly explained by the strong 
decrease in capacity utilisation.  
Over the 2010-15 period, the crisis is anticipated to 
impact potential growth via both productivity 
growth and labour utilisation. Regarding 
productivity, the crisis might adversely affect the 
pace of capital accumulation as the timing and 
extent of the recovery in investment activity hinges 
upon the need for rebuilding of capital stocks, the 
prospects for global and domestic demand and the 
size of capital costs. The negative effect of slower 
capital accumulation can be magnified by the fact 
that the depreciation rates of the capital stock 
might increase due to the ongoing economic 
restructuring which will make some capital 

vintages obsolete. Total factor productivity (TFP) 

might also be affected by 
the crisis to the extent 
that the long-run drivers of TFP such as physical 

investment or R&D and innovation are affected. 

For example, investment may suffer further from 

a timid recovery, changes in attitudes towards risk 
leading to the tightening of credit conditions. 
As investments in private R&D are markedly 
pro-cyclical, the crisis might result in a slowdown 
in the pace of technolo
gical progress. A slow 
process of industrial restructuring caused either by 

credit constraints, possibly due to delayed 

adjustments in the banking sector, or by 

entrenched structural rigidities, can also hurt the 
growth rate of TFP growth by locking resources in 
relatively unproductive activities. 
Labour utilisation is expected to be affected as 
a result of the crisis through reductions in average 
hours worked and labour participation as well 
as an increase in the 
rate of structural unemployment (NAIRU). Past experiences show 
that rises in NAIRU during and in the aftermath of 

crises tend to be persistent. Lasting increases in 

capital costs, arising from the shifts in attitudes 

towards risk brought about by the financial 
turmoil, have a potential to raise the NAIRU 
permanently as firms would increase their mark-up 
to recoup the higher cost
 of capital. Moreover, 
long unemployment spells may cause a permanent 

destruction in human capital, leading to an 
irreversible rise in the NAIRU (the so-called 

'hysteresis effect') and further losses in potential 

output growth in the medium-term.

As explained indetailin Box I.3.1, potentialgrowth corresponds to a concept of sustainable trend growth compatible with supply-sideconditions, correctingfor the short-term cyclicalfluctuations in actual GDP growth. As suggestedby Graph I.3.2.a potential growth in the EU27 is expected tobe particularly low (1.1%) over the forecast horizon (2010-12). The situation is expected tobe even more lacklustre in the euro area, withbroadly similar but more acute patterns.It is likely to suffer from the lower use of labour, which is attributable to the significant rise in NAIRU but also the further decline in averagehours workedperworker and the slow contraction of working-age population. It will also be affectedby the slower capital accumulation due to historically low investment rate in the wake of thecrisis. This would be combined with slow total factor productivity growth, gradually recoveringfrom the crisis but still converging to the weakpre-crisis path. Beyond the forecast horizon, in absence of resolute policies, potential growth is likely to remain weak:over the period 2011-20, the average potential growth rate is projected to be around 1½% in the EU27. This is significantly lower than the rates observed in the EU in the past two decades, which were, moreover, much lower than those recordedin the US. This is accounted for by the pronounced underutilisation of labour in the wake of the crisis, combined with the contraction of labour due to population ageing at the end of the period andfairly slowproductivity growth in the EU27. The picture for productivity growthwill be particularly gloomy for the euro area, as the former will standat around 1¼% on average. Most countries havebeen stronglyaffected by the crisis, through both capital accumulation and labour utilisation, and are expected to record a reduction of their labourresources at the end of the decade owing to the population ageing.

Nonetheless,experiences from past economic and financialcrises indicate that policy responses matter greatly.For example, the deep recessions which started in50 Economic developments at the aggregated level 
1991 in Sweden and Finland were relatively short 
lived and did not result in a reduction in potential 

output growth. 
This was inter alia
 thanks to significant 
restructuring of their economies. On the other 
hand, an insufficiently resolute policy reaction to 
the financial crisis, combined with mounting 
competitive pressures from emerging economies, 

contributed to the slowdown in long-run potential 

growth in Japan in the course of 1990s.  
3.3. THE IMPACT OF REFORMS ON GROWTH: 
HOW MUCH AND WHEN CAN THEY 
DELIVER? The following discussion focuses on reforms in 
labour and product markets. Obviously, future 

growth prospects will also be shaped by other 

types of policies such as the regulatory efforts in 

financial markets and the progress in financial 

market repair, policies to 
meet the climate change 
targets or policies aimed at promoting social 
cohesion. As regards financial market policies, the 
growth effects of the ongoing efforts to redesign 
the regulatory environment (e.g. enhanced 
supervision, improved prudential regulation for 
banks and insurance company) are ambiguous. 
Progress on financial repair and improvements in 
the functioning of financial markets can have very 

significant implications for short- to medium-run 

growth through reductions in risk premia on 

capital; on the other hand, stricter regulation could 

increase the cost of capital in historical 
comparison; thus, the net impact is still unclear.   
The efforts to meet the cl
imate change targets can 
also generate costs and reduce, at least 
temporarily, growth. However, recent ECFIN 

analysis demonstrates that a well-designed "green" 

growth agenda might allevi
ate the costs associated 
with reducing the carbon emissions.

literature (see for example Benabou, 1997
(49)), 
there is no conclusive evidence on the growth 
effects of cohesion policies, partially owing to the 

multiple and complex channels at work. It is not 

possible to exclude that there will be some 

trade-off between equity and efficiency and hence 
growth, at least in the short- to medium-run. 
However, that may not be inevitable given that 
there are many countries with relatively low 
income disparities among the 20 richest countries 
in terms of GDP per capita. 
3.3.1. Macroeconomic effects of structural 
reforms  This section explores the macroeconomic effects 
of different structural reforms, both in terms of 

their potential to stimulate long-run growth and 

their dynamics. It builds on simulations undertaken 

with the QUEST III model.
(50) These are 
complemented with findings from empirical 

literature. It is important to recall that the 

modelling results focus on the EU as a whole and 

do not consider the specific situations of individual 

EU countries. In practice, policies will operate 
against the backdrop of a large diversity among the 
EU countries in terms of their main economic 
challenges to growth. The different starting 
conditions across Member States will inform 
different policy prioritie
s, which will crucially 
influence the design of concrete reform agendas 

and potential effects of specific reforms. 
While the strategy of reforms should be 
tailor-made for each country, this section only 
discusses some relevant reform ingredients that 
could be considered and on which model 
simulations are available. It focuses on some 
specific types reforms and, by no means, covers 
the full variety of growth-enhancing reforms in the 

labour markets, product markets and the wide 

array of measures to promote knowledge and 

innovation. The following discussion deals with 

the potential impact of some structural reforms

Box I.3.1: 
Potential growth: the concept and its components
In a standard production function framework, 
potential GD
P can be represented by a combination 
of fact
or inputs (labour and capital), multiplied 
with the technological level or total factor 
productivity (TFP).
(1)
 Given that potential output is 
an unobs
erved variable, it is necessary to clearly 

define the 
potential use
 of each factor of production 
and the trend (i.e. normal) le
vel of 
efficiency 
of 
factor inputs.
  First,
labour input
 is defined in terms of total hours 
worked. Determining the trend of labour input 
involves several steps. We start from the actual 
population of working age. We obtain the trend 

labour fo
rce by mechanically detrending (using an 
HP filter) the participat
ion rate. In a next step, we 
cal
culate trend un/employment to be consistent 
with stable
, non-accelerating, (wage) inflation 
(NAWRU). Finally, we obtain trend hours wo
rked 
(potential labour supply) by multiplying trend 
employment with the trend of average hours 
worked. One of the advantages of this
 approach is 
that it generates a potential employment series 
which is relatively stable whilst at the same time 
also providing for year-to-year changes clos
ely 
linked to long-run demo
graphic and labour market 
developments
 in areas, such as the actual working 
age population, trend participation rates and 
structural unemployment.

010), "The production function methodology for 
calculating potential growth rates & ou
tput gaps", 
Econ
omic Papers 420, July 2010, European 
Commission. 
Second, with respect to 
capital
, this task of 
defining potential factor use is straightforward 
since the maximum potential output contribution of 
capital is given by the full utilisation of the existing 
capital stock in an economy.
 Since the capital stock 
is
 an indicator of overall capacity, there is no 
justification to smooth this series in the production 
function approach. In addition, the unsmoothed 
series is relatively stable for EU economies since 
net investment in any given year, which is quite 
volatile Œ represents only a tiny fraction of the 
capital stock. In terms of the measurement of 
the capital stock,
 the perpetual inventory method is 
used which requires an initial assumption regarding 
the size of the capital / output ratio.  
Third, potential output embeds a 
trend efficiency 
component
, al
so called trend TFP. Potential output 
refers to the level of output wh
ich can be produced 
with a "normal" level of efficien
cy of factor inputs. 
This trend efficiency level is measured using 
a bivariat
e Kalman filter model which exploits the 
link between the TFP cycle and the degree of 
capaci
ty utilisation in the economy.  
Finally the production function allows fo
r deriving 
future potential output growth from the growth in 
individual factor inputs.
 Potential output growth is 
calculated as the sum of trend TFP growth, 
potential labour supply growth we
ighted by the 
share of labour in total value-added, and the 
increase in total capital stock multiplied by 1 mi
nus the labour share.

P and the investment to potential 
output ratio. 
a desired composition of reform packages to be 
implemented. 
Overall, the model simulations and econometric 
estimates confirm that structural reforms deliver 
important benefits in terms of increased output 
(see table I.3.2). While the reforms reported in the 

table should not be interpreted as any sort of 

"priority list", a broad assessment of these results 

indicates that both labour and product market 
 reforms will have an important role in boosting 
potential output in the coming decade.
(51)(51) The stylised nature of the policy shocks in these 
simula
tions makes the comparison of the effects of 
On the product market side, reforms leading to 
reductions in final goods market mark-ups 

(e.g. services), to smarter network industry 

regulation and to reductions in administrative 
individual reform measures difficult. A possible way of 
making different types of shocks (with different units) 
broadly comp
arable is to apply the structural reform 
multipliers to the actual cross-country dispersions or, 
similarly, to reflect the existing scope for improvement 
vis-à-vis a specific benchmark, i.e. performance gap. The 
results shown in Table I.3.1, therefore, provide, where 
possible, two measures to ease the comparison: (i) the 
effects of improving the po

52 Economic developments at the aggregated level 
burden will improve allocative efficiency in the 
economy. Structural reforms that promote 

knowledge and innovation, albeit being essential 

for boosting potential growth, imply important 

reallocation of resources in the economy and yield 

output gains only in the long-run. Moreover, they 
often require substantial initial investments. 
Amongst the surveyed labour market reforms, 
measures to increase labo
ur supply via activation 
measures, including reductions in the long-term 

benefit replacement rate, and tax reforms that 
reduce the tax burden on 
labour, especially the 
low-skilled, could bring about significant GDP 
increases. While the major share of gains from 

structural reforms typically materialises in the 

longer-run, there are re
form measures that 
potentially yield benefits already relatively rapidly. 

This can be seen from graph I.3.3, which shows 
the time profiles of the selected reforms measures 
based on different assumptions on the speed of 
their implementation, ranging from periods of two 
to ten years. Taking into account the necessary 

implementation gaps demonstrates that, in practise, 

the short-term impact of reforms crucially hinges 
upon a swift implementation.  
The results in graph I.3.3 indicate that product 
market reforms, particul
arly those increasing the 
level of competition in the services sector or 

network industries, can deliver benefits already 

over a relatively short horizon. Also, removal of 
the existing regulatory and administrative barriers 
for businesses is likely to generate non-negligible 
gains. Some of these reforms have relatively 
limited budgetary costs which improves their 
attractiveness in face of
 the existing budgetary 
constraints. However, slow implementation will 

considerably delay the gr
owth effects of these 
measures. Labour market reforms are crucial to 
support the reduction of the high unemployment 

levels and to prevent unemployment from 

becoming structural. Their benefits could start 

materialising within a reasonable timeframe, but 
significant short-run adjustment costs and even 
temporary increases in unemployment cannot be 
fully excluded. They, moreover, have important 
distributional effects with a possibly prolonged 

decline in real wages. On the other hand, the 

positive impact of reforms could potentially be 
supported by confidence-boosting and signalling 
effects. Overall, it need
s to be emphasised that, 
contrary to their long-run benefits, short-run 
effects of structural 
reforms are sometimes 

ambiguous and should not be overestimated. In 

particular, the existing approaches to estimating 
the impact of reforms might not fully capture all 
the short-run costs associated with reforms.  
Both product and labour market reforms typically 
aim at improving allocat
ive efficiency, implying 
an upward shift in the level of output. Thus, they 
tend to raise growth rates only temporarily, albeit 
over a considerable peri
od of time. Permanent 
increases in output growth rates, through 

improvements in TFP growth, typically rely on an 
increased pace in generating and exploiting 
knowledge and innovations. As stressed above, 

permanent increases in TFP growth will be 

essential to counter the secular declining trend in 

growth of labour productivity. 
A closer look at effects of measures to 
promote knowledge and innovation, – Policies promoting innovation and human capital 
formation have a capacity to permanently increase 

potential growth rates. Nevertheless, their 

short-run effects tend to be very small and could 

even be slightly negative. This is due to the 

substantial structural adjustment that they unleash 
in the economy, as we
ll as the associated 
budgetary costs. The mode
l simulations show that 

measures to boost R&D 
through tax credits or 
wage subsidies to research personnel start 

generating fruits only in the very long-run, i.e. at 
least a decade.  
Similarly, policies to upgrade human capital by 
improving the educational composition of the 
labour force deliver very substantial long-run 
growth dividends but take a very long time to 
materialise. Increases in public spending on 
education have some short-run positive demand 
effects which are comparatively higher than other 
non-productive government spending due to the 

high return on this type of investment. In this 

context, efficiency of education spending is 

important. 
For example, St. Aubyn et al. (2009) suggest that 
the strength of the link between the resources used 
in tertiary education and broader economic 
outcomes, like productivity, crucially depends on 
efficiency of spending.
(52) Moreover, policies that 
increase efficiency are high
ly relevant in view of 
the existing severe budgetary constrains in most

Educational policies take verylong time before they cansignificantly affect theskill levels of the workforce as a whole. Butunderinvestment in these types of productive expenditures could undermine the futurecompetitiveness and growth performance of the European economy, also in view of increasing global competition and substantial investments thatare being undertaken bythe maincompetitors. The generation and exploitation of innovations canalsobe effectively boosted by improvements inframework conditions (e.g. improved market entry,more favourable business environment, more effective IPR regime or availability ofventure capital). Measures that deliver better framework conditions can, in many cases, be implementedquickly andwith limited budgetary costs.  –product market reforms – Product market reforms generally have highpotential to boostoutput and employment. Theyoften comprise measures to strengthen the businessenvironment by improving regulatory conditionsor reducing administrative burdens on companies, to facilitate market entry in specific shieldedsectors, to allow for effective exit frommarkets, toput in place efficient pro-competitive frameworks or to improve the availability of credit for businesses. Increased competitive pressures and(threatof) entry of new firms typically boostsproductivity; it improves the allocation ofresources, both between different sectors towardsthose with better growth perspectives andwithin sectors, and induces internal restructuring at firmlevel leading tohigher productive efficiency. Someof these effects start unfolding already ina relatively short time horizon after their implementationwhile full benefits are typicallylinked to the progress insectoral restructuringwhich is a long-run phenomenon. Looking ataggregate product market regulation indexes,Mourougane and Vogel (2008)(53) report that correlations between changes in structuralunemployment and productmarket reforms are significant already in the first years following their introduction. Some of thesemeasures also have comparatively limited Œ budgetary, administrative or political Œcosts. For example, unlike in the case of labour market reforms, costs of product market reforms are usually concentrated on a relatively narrow groupof economic agents, which limits their political costs. Product market reforms may alsoincrease the incentives of firms to innovate.(54)Moreover, there are possibly spillovers between product market and labourmarket reforms. For example, Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003)(55) takea political economy perspective and argue that product market reforms can help implementlabour market reforms as they tend to reduce opposition to the latter by reducing the rents to bedistributedbetween the workers and firms. The simulationssuggest that measures to increase competition in product markets which lead to reductions inprice-cost mark-ups deliver important output gains.These gains materialise rather quickly and areaccompanied by increases inemployment and real(53)Mourougane, Annabelle and Lukas Vogel, 2008.

Furthermeasures that improve the framework conditionsfor innovative firms are those that ease access to financing, i.e. through better access to venturecapital (modelled as a reduction inriskpremium on intangible capital). Also these measures deliver benefits witha significantdelay. On the other hand, they have a potential to quickly increase R&D intensity. wages. For example, reducing mark-ups in the model's final goods sector (roughly corresponding to the services sector in the real economy) by 1 pp. increases GDP by around ½% by 2020 (to put thisinto perspective, average mark-ups in the EU areroughly 4 pps. above those in the US, with the largest roomfor improvement in the servicessector). In reality, though, policy measures are likely to translate with (possibly non-negligible)timelags intohigher levels of competition and, in turn, reductions in mark-ups. Similarly, policy initiatives to cut red tape, especially for SMEs, are shown to bring significant output gains, which could materialise rapidly. These measures typically reduce the overhead costs that firms need to bear. A 10% drop in administrative burden oncompanies, modelled as a reduction in fixed costs, boosts GDP by0.6%.(56)Reductions in entry barriers for (high-tech) start-ups strengthen the adaptive capacity of the economy, facilitate structural change and, at the (56)Some of the regulatory reforms, which essentially depend on an adoption of a legal act, can be brought to life withoutprolonged implementation lags. On the other hand, reductions in administrative burden can come throughintroducing e-government projects which could imply relatively important costs of setting up the necessary infrastructure. As these costs are not considered in thesimulations, the short- to medium-run output effects couldbe biased upwards.– and labour market reforms. The effects of labour market reforms generallymaterialise through improvements in labourutilisation, either due to increased labour supply or reduced structural unemployment. For instance, policies that promote active inclusion in the labour market, foster real andnominal wageflexibilityand cut labour taxes contribute to increasing laboursupply, reducing structuralunemploymentandboosting competitiveness and adjustment capacity.  (57)Aghion et al. (2007) argue that financial frictions (for start ups) are at least as important as labour market rigidities forexplaining productivity differences between countries.55 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Labour market activationpolicies also support the protection of the most vulnerable groupsthreatenedby long-term exclusion from the labourmarket. The modelling approachof cutting theunemployment benefit replacement rate is onlyillustrative ofa wider andmore complex set ofpolicies aiming at activating labour supply. An integrated flexicurity approachhelps to reduce moral hazard associated with more generous social security systems. In theory, an increase in unemployment benefits is positively correlatedwithunemployment, especially its duration, as it tends to increase reservation wage, workers™ wagebargaining power and reduce job search intensity. But the generous provision of unemploymentbenefits could be compatible with low unemployment and high labour supply, providedthat it is accompanied by effective active labourmarket policies (ALMP), inparticular efficient jobsearch support and work incentives toensure a balance between rights and duties and toeliminate potential adverse impacts onunemployment. A declining profile ofbenefits over time and strict job-search conditionality ofbenefits can provide proper incentives. The success of some Northern European countries is toa large extent attributed to reforms whichunderlined the more active approach in labour market policies with a clear job search and employment focus.(58) By providing (re)training and efficient job placement services, ALMP could also favour the mobility of labour across firms, sectors and regions. There are also strongcomplementarities between different labour market institutions,(59) for example between the generosity of unemployment benefits (including their timeprofile andconditionality) and the level ofemployment protection legislation (EPL).  The impact ofthese reforms onproductivity is notstraightforward. As labour market reforms increasing labour supply typically result in a drop of the capital-to-labour ratio, they tend to temporarily lower productivity growth. On the other hand, smoothly functioning labour markets allow for better matching between workers and jobs, which improves average productivity levelsandprevents losses inhuman capital due to long(58)Andersen T. and M.Svarer (2008), Flexicurity inDenmark, CESifo Dice Report, Vol. 6, No. 4, CESifoGmbH.(59)See for example Coe, D.a D.

The simulations show thatlabour market measures which increase participation and labour demand can deliverhighbenefits (Table I.3.2). They consider in particular measures that increase labour supply throughreducingthe reservation wage(e.g. bytighteningeligibility criteria), or strengthen labour demandthrough reducing the mark-ups of wages over the reservation wage (e.g. by reinforced matching of skills and jobs orreforms in wage-bargainingorwage-setting frameworks) or decreasing taxburden on labour (in general or specificallylow-skilled labour). This is partially given by the fact that there exists an important scope forimproving policy settings ina number ofMember States. The estimates of OECD(2010)(60) also suggest an important long-run impact of adjustingthe levels of EPL, whichreduces the segmentation of the labour market and facilitates the adjustmentprocesses in the economy. Pension reforms that increase the effective retirement age or reduce thereplacement rates also have a favourable impact for the functioningof the labour market as well as long-run sustainability of public finances (for a more detailed discussion see the discussion in the previous chapter in box I.2.2 in Chapter 2). Part of the effects of labour market reforms materialises already in first two to three years after their implementation, although their full benefits come after much longer time (see graph I.3.3).(61)These measures can in principle be implemented relatively quickly as long as there exist politicaldeterminationand, ideally, broad social consensus on their necessity. Therefore, it is plausible toconsider the trajectories in graph I.3.3, whichassume phasing in of reforms over two or possibly five years. (60)Dougherty, S.,S.Barnes, P. Briard,R. Bouis and M. Eris(2010), ﬁThe GDP Impact of Structural Reform: A Simulation Frameworkﬂ, OECD Economics Department Working Papers, forthcoming.(61)Mourougane and Vogel (2008) find a high and statisticallysignificant correlation between structural unemployment and reforms reducing tax wedge already shortly after their implementation. The correlations for other labourmarket reforms are considerably lower (e.g. EPL) or reach theirmaximum later (e.g. average replacement rates). While the model simulations donot point to significant short-run costs of these reforms, it must be acknowledged that some labour market reformsmay have considerable upfront budgetary costs (e.g. spending on ALMPs or uncompensated labour tax reductions) and other adjustment costs in the early stages after their adoption.(62) Inparticular,  measures that increase the adjustment capacity of labour markets can lead, in the short-run, to a temporary drop inreal wages (Blanchardand Giavazzi, 2003) or an increase in unemployment. Indeed, themodel simulationsconfirm that these measures generally result ina reduction in real wages, especially for the lower-skilledworkers, which take a long time to recover. Despite boosting long-runcompetitiveness and outputgrowth, wage moderation policies thus cansuppress demand in the short-run and generatea slowdown in economicactivity. These findingsare in line with empirical evidence assembled in IMF (2004), which also suggests that labour market reforms can have a significant negative impact on growth in the short run. However, despite a temporary increase in unemployment,they relatively quickly turn positive and succeed in reducing the unemployment rate. Tax reforms were found to bring a rather immediate benefit,boosting growth and reducing unemployment. 3.3.2. Potential gain of reforms Œanaggregated stylised scenario Using the stylised simulation results discussed in the previous section, this section explores the possible magnitude of aggregated gains fromstructural reforms. It presents a stylised reformscenariocombiningreforms from the mainpolicy areas, which have a potential to stimulate both employment growth and productivity growth. The description of reform policies included in the reform scenario is shown inTable I.3.2. (62)See for example Deroose, S. and A. Turrini (2005), "The Short-term Budgetary Impact of Structural Reforms. Evidence from a Panel of EU Countries", CEPR Discussion Paper,5217.Table I.3.3:Description of the stylised reform scenarioProduct markets and knowledge & innovationLabour marketsIncreasepublic R&D by0.1% GDP through tax creditsTax shift from labourto VAT (1/3 gap)Reducemark-ups (1/3 gap)Reduce benefitreplacement rate(1/3gap)Reduce administrative burdenby10%57 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
The results of this exercise clearly demonstrate 
that progress with an 
integrated package of 
structural reforms can bring substantial dividend. 

But obviously, such a scenario should be seen as 

purely stylised and illustrative and cannot serve 

as a blueprint for a reform policy agenda.  
The scenario combines QUE
ST III multipliers of 
different reforms to obtain the growth dividend 
of reform. Such an approach can be justified by the 

broadly linear nature of the simulation results. 

However, it does not capture potential synergies or 

trade-offs between specifi
c reforms; indeed, there 
may be economic or political economy trade-offs 
between some reforms, which should be taken into 
account when designing reform agendas. 
The results are to a large extent dependent on the 
assumptions about the extent and pace of structural 
reforms, as  the magnitude of economic benefits is 
obviously conditional on the policy efforts made.  

The scenario assumes that reform gains 

momentum across the EU countries and important 

progress will be achieved across all the main 

policy areas. It feeds in 
significant increases in 

knowledge-oriented expenditures as well as bold 

reforms in product and labour markets. It generally 

assumes that the EU, on av
erage, proceeds to close 
 of the performance gap 
in specific policy areas 
with the three best EU performers. It is assumed 
that implementation of reforms starts in 2011. In 
order to capture the gradual implementation of 
growth-enhancing policies, the gap in the policy 
variables is reduced gradually within a period of 

five years. The policy assumption of closing a third of the 
performance gaps with three "best performers" in 
the EU appears reasonably ambitious and realistic 
at the same time broadly achievable in historical 
comparison; the existing performance gaps for the 

policy variables included in this scenario are 

provided in Table I.3.3  
As Table I.3.3 documents, the reform efforts 
necessary to partially close the performance gaps 
have been witnessed in the past (e.g. net 
replacement ratios). On th
e other hand, (public) 
spending on R&D or education has not increased 

substantially in the past and future increases would 
clearly need to reflect a political decision on 
(re)allocation available 
budgetary resources. 
Similarly, the tax burden on labour (measured as 
implicit tax rate on labour) has stayed relatively 

stable over the past decade. As regards mark-ups 
in the services sector, the past evidence is more 
mixed but indicates that the implied reductions, 
while significant, might not be excessive. For 
example, Badinger (2007)
(63) estimated that mark 
ups in the services sector increased from 30% to 
37% in the course of 90s, which points 

to important obstacles to competition in this sector. 
The scenario developed in this chapter assumes 
that progress in completing the Single Market and 
improvements in the business environment could 
help reduce mark-ups in 
the services sector by 

2 pps. and lower administrative burden for 

companies by 10%.
(64) It further assumes that 
labour market reforms stimulate labour supply and  

increase incentives to work; this is implemented in 

the model via a reduction in long-run net 

replacement ratios by 5 pps.
(65) Moreover, tax 
reforms are assumed to shift part of tax burden, in 

an order of roughly 2.5% of GDP, from labour to 

consumption taxes. Finally, the scenario feeds in 

an arbitrarily selected in
crease in public spending 
on R&D of 0.1% GDP which would bring the EU 
spending to 0.7%, i.e. the current level recorded in 
the US.   
(63) Badinger, Harald (2007), "Has the EU's Single Market 
Programme Fostered Competitio
n? Testing for a Decrease 
in Mark-up Ratios in EU Industries," Oxford Bulletin of 
Economics and Statistics, Department of Economics, 
University of Oxford
, vol. 69(4), pages 497-519, 08. 
(64) This assumption is arbitrary and does not rely on estimates 
of a "performance gap" as there are no reliable estima
tes of 
the extent of administrative burden and the scope for its 
reductions available. Efforts to cut red tape feature high on 
policy agendas of EU countries. In
 January 2007, the 
Commission adopted an action programme aimed at 
reducing administrative burdens on businesses in the EU 
by 25% in 2012. The EU and Member States have made 
some progress toward
s this benchmark though it difficult to 
devise a quantitative measure. The scenarios therefore 

assume that these efforts will be continued and that it will 
be possible to reduce administrative burden by up to 10% 
between 2011 and 2020. 
(65) In policy terms, it is in essentially the long-run replacement 
rates that should be a concern of reforms to make work
 pay. Th
e long-run unemploymen
t benefit replacement rates 
play a key role in determini
ng job-search intensity. In the 
short-run, unemp
loyment benefits play an important social 
role as they allow the unemplo
yed to search for a suitable 
job and hence the short-run replacement rates rather refl
ect the extent to which dismissed workers are supported in the 
periods of job transitions. As the model features only 
average replacement ra
tio, the shock is scaled 
appropriately.

A non-negligiblepartof these gains accrues already soon after the startof the implementation of the reform package. The level ofGDP in the EU increases by around ½% inthe second year compared to the baseline and the outputgains rise to around1½% in 2015 and close to 3½% in 2030(table I.3.4). Around 15% of the long-run dividends thusmaterialise in the second year after theimplementation of the reform package.(66)Employmentgains would also be substantial:rising from around ½% in 2012 to a levelof 1½%in 2015 and onwards. Not surprisingly, a dominantpart of employment gains is due to labourmarketreforms with product markets and particularlyR&D and innovation measures contributing onlymodestly. Table I.3.3 shows the contribution ofindividual reformmeasures as specified in thescenario. (66)These figures need to be treated with caution as the short-run effects of reforms are rather uncertain as discussed above and the simulations might not fullyaccount for the possible short-run costs.Table I.3.4:Macroeconomic effectsof individual structural reforms2012201520202030GDP effectsReduction ofmark-up0.20.70.90.6Reduction in administrativeburden 0.10.30.30.6R&D tax subsidy0.00.00.00Reduction in benefit replacement rate0.10.30.51.7Tax shiftfromlabour to VAT0.10.30.50.3Total0.41.52.23Employment effectsReduction ofmark-up0.20.40.20.1Reduction in administrativeburden-0.1-0.1-0.1-0.1R&D tax subsidy0.00.00.00Reduction in benefit replacement rate0.10.50.80.8Tax shiftfromlabour to VAT0.10.40.60.7Total0.31.21.51.1.3.0.4Output as well as employment gains are driven byproduct market and labour market reforms. In theinitial stages, a somewhat larger share of outputincreases would come from product marketreforms (graph I.3.4). In the medium- to long-runthe contribution from productmarket and labourmarket reforms would roughly be equal. Thecontribution from knowledge-oriented measureswouldbe slightly negative in the first decade and turn positive only in the long-run. Not surprisingly, the employment gains are predominantly due tolabour market reforms. Increased employment dueto labour market reforms induces a drop inproductivity as the capital-to-labour ratio decreases, partially counteracting the productivity-enhancing effects of product market reforms. Consequently, the overall effects of the reform package initially materialise to a large extentthrough increased labour utilisation withproductivity improvements takingholdonly in the later stages. 3.4. CONCLUSIONS The growth performance in the EU over the pastdecade has been lacklustre, suggesting that there are various structural weaknesses or market distortions that hold back the potential for growthin Europe. Potential growth is expected tobeparticularly low (close to 1% on average) over the forecast horizon in the EU27. The situation is expected tobe even more lacklustre in the euro area. The driving forces would be the lower use of labour Œ owing to the rise in NAIRU and a furtherdecline in average hour worked Œ and a slowercapital accumulation due to historically low investment rate in the wake of the crisis. This would be combinedwith slow total factor productivity growth, gradually recoveringfrom the crisis but still converging to the weak pre-crisis 59 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
60 path. Beyond the forecast ho
rizon, in absence of 
resolute policies, potential growth is likely to 
remain weak: over the period 2011-20, the average 

potential growth rate is projected to be only around 

1½% in the EU27. This is significantly lower than 

the  rates  experienced  in  the  EU  in  the past 
twodecades. This is accounted for by the 
underutilisation of labour in the wake of the crisis, 
combined with the contraction of labour due to 
population ageing at the end of the period and 
fairly slow productivity growth in the EU27.  
Structural reforms can boost GDP level in the

much more uncertain due to the important

PART II Prospects by individual economy 
Member States 1. BELGIUM Gradual recovery in an uncertain environment 64 An open economy recovering from the crisis thanks to a revival of exports Real GDP growth is expected to be positive againin 2010 after contracting sharply by 2.8% in 2009,in the context of the global economic and financialcrisis. In the second quarter of 2010, it increasedby 1%q-o-q, after havingstagnated in the firstquarter. This strong performance was partly due toa rebound inconstruction activity after the bad weather conditions, which had negatively affectedthis sector at the beginningof 2010. Activity alsobenefited from a strong increase innetexports, thanks to the spectacular economic recovery in Germany ŒBelgium™s main tradingpartner. However, a moderation of GDP growthis foreseenfrom the second half of2010, due to a smallersupport of inventory building and weaker export performance compared to the first half of the year. Exports may be expected to slow down aseconomic growth subdues in Belgium's maintradingpartners in the wakeof the phasing out of stimulus measures and the need for fiscalconsolidation in many EU countries. Furthermore, weaker-than-expected world trade developmentscouldhave negative spillovers in Europe and Belgium, and a resumption of tensionson the financial markets might also play a dampeningrole.Gradual recovery ahead Due to the above-mentioned strong rebound and still relatively good prospects for the secondhalf of the year, GDP growth in2010 should reach 2%, which is better than foreseen in the Commissionspring 2010 Forecast. Growth this year should besupported by positive contributions fromboth net exports anddomestic demand.  In general terms, however, domestic demand willremain relatively subdued in 2010 because: (i) companies will prefer to absorb existing excess capacity, which acts asa deterrent tonew investment; and (ii) limitedgrowth in realdisposable income Œ due to still increasing unemployment, less buoyant wagegrowth anda pick-up inHICP inflation (to 2.3%) Œ will have a dampening impact on consumption.  On the other hand, better prospects on employmentcontribute to the improvement in consumerconfidence, so that private consumption growthwill reach positive territory, together with a sharp decline of 1.7pps. in the saving rate(to 16.6%).  GDP is projected to expandby 1.8% in2011 and by 2% in2012, which is higher than the euro-areaaverage. Private consumption is expected to grow less than GDP in 2011 on the back of a moderate increase indisposable income, while the saving rate remains stable. Higher growth inprivate consumption is expected for 2012 as job creation accelerates. Graph II.1.1:Belgium - GDP growth andcontributions-4-3-2-10

The high growth in total investment expected for 2011 is linked to a projectedacceleration of government investment due to thelocal elections in 2012, as observed on previousoccasions.   In 2009, housing investment in Belgium declined less than in the euro area, since there weremuch more limited excesses in the residential real estatemarket and also because of the temporary reduction in the VAT rate for residentialconstruction.In2010, housing investment isforecast to continue to contract, albeit at a slowerpace. Nevertheless, at the end of 2010, the slowdown in the housing market now seems to be over and house prices are tending torise again. Member States, Belgium The competitive position weakened in recentyears and little improvement is expected– After a sharpdecline in exports and imports, the recovery in2010 is being export-led. For 2011 and2012, high export and import growth are stillforeseen. However the contribution of net trade toGDP growth will belower. It is not sure, however, whether Belgiumwill be able tofully benefit from a rebound of the world economy. Over the past years, there has beena structural loss of market share for Belgian exports forbothgoods and services.(67) Since 2005, unit labour costs (ULC) have increased more in Belgium than in the euro area, mainly as a resultof the slowdown inproductivity growth in Belgium and higher wage increases compared to the three neighbouring countries. More generally, export performance also seems to be suffering from an adverse geographical andproduct market orientation. Indeed, exports are mainly oriented towards other euro-area countries,whose imports have been less dynamic than worldtrade. In addition, Belgium's productspecialisation,in goods with relatively low technology content, has appearedlessadvantageous than for the euro area as a whole. Looking forward, the demand for those products may continue to underperform, while pricecompetition is likely to become even stronger, posing challenges to the sustainability ofexport growth and firms' profitability. The rapidrise in ULC in 2009 and stabilisation in2010 are mainly due to the cyclical profile of productivity and the effect of wage indexation, reacting with a lag tohigher inflation in2008 anda fall in2009. After a decrease in 2009, labour productivity is expected togrow again over theforecast period, though only moderately. Theslowdown in productivity growth together with the increase inwages, will cause ULC to rise again in 2011-12.  –while labour utilisation is set to remain low– The impact of the economic recession on domesticemployment was relatively contained. A temporary decline inhours workedŒ thanks to the temporaryunemployment schemes Œ and labour productivityper hour fulfilled a buffer function. Hours worked (67)As calculated by the growth differential between Belgian export markets and Belgian exports.and productivity are expected to increase again over the forecast period. Employment would riseagain from2010 onwards, by0.4%in 2010 and 0.3% in2011, while a slightly faster growth is expected in 2012(0.6%). The number ofunemployed is expected toincrease faster than theincreasein the labour force in 2010 and 2011, causing a further rise in the unemployment rate before it startsdecreasing again in2012(to 8.7%).In the longer term, the major risk is that part of the cyclical rise in unemployment becomes a structural increase (known as the hysteresis effect).

However, this had animportant effect on Belgium's budgetary situation, which had been progressing substantially until2007.  The general government deficit, which increasedto 6%of GDP in 2009due to the automaticstabilisers andto a lesser extent recovery measures in the aftermath of the crisis, is expected to start decreasing again, althoughnot verydynamically asyet.  Despite higher than previously expected GDP growth in 2010, the deficit will not come outbelow the target specified in the StabilityProgramme (4.8%). This is due to the counterbalancing effect of both positive and 65 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Table II.1.1:Main featuresof country forecast - BELGIUM2009Annual percentagechangebn EURCurr. prices% GDP92-05200720082009201020112012 GDP 339.2100.02.12.91.0-2.82.01.82.0 Private consumption177.852.41.61.81.5-0.31.41.31.9 Publicconsumption83.724.71.62.12.30.61.41.21.4Gross fixed capital formation72.321.32.26.52.9-5.3-1.12.62.9 of which :  equipment30.08.82.49.43.1-9.80.14.04.5 Exports (goodsand services)247.573.04.84.41.7-11.69.65.76.0 Imports (goods and services)238.270.24.54.73.0-11.18.55.56.1GNI (GDP deflator)342.3100.92.13.01.5-3.32.01.82.0Contribution to GDP growth :Domestic demand1.72.71.9-1.20.91.51.9Inventories0.10.20.1-1.00.10.00.0Net exports0.40.0-1.0-0.51.00.30.1 Employment0.71.61.7-0.40.40.30.6 Unemployment rate(a)8.47.57.07.98.68.88.7Compensation of employees/head2.93.43.61.81.52.32.3 Unitlabourcosts whole economy1.52.14.44.3-0.10.71.0Real unit labour costs-0.4-0.22.43.2-1.8-1.2-0.9Savingsrate of households (b)--17.018.316.616.616.8 GDP deflator1.92.31.91.11.72.01.9 Harmonised index of consumer prices1.91.84.50.02.31.91.9Terms of trade of goods-0.40.3-2.93.5-2.20.0-0.1 Trade balance(c)3.11.6-1.60.1-0.4-0.2-0.3 Current-account balance (c)4.53.91.12.01.72.02.0 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-)vis-à-vis ROW(c)4.33.60.61.61.41.71.8General government balance (c)-2.2-0.3-1.3-6.0-4.8-4.6-4.7Cyclically-adjusted budget balance(c)-2.4-1.6-2.1-4.6-3.7-3.7-4.1Structural budget balance (c)--1.6-2.2-4.0-3.8-3.7-4.1General government gross debt (c)113.284.289.696.298.6100.5102.1(a)Eurostat definition(b) gross saving divided bygross disposable income (c) as a percentageofGDP66 negative factors. On the positive side, the evolution of the deficit benefitted from a decrease in interest rates (stable interest payments in 2010),and the extra revenues from banks of about 0.1% ofGDP (dividends, interests paid on loans, contributions to the depositguarantee fund)  andhigher VATreceipts due to higher private consumption. On the other hand, corporate tax receipts have turned out to be lower than foreseen, and the speeding-up in the enrolment(68) of personal income taxes still has a negative effect in 2010.  Our forecast is basedon the no-policy-change assumption, wherebyno consolidation measureswill be taken. In reality Œ as there is currently onlya caretaker government Œ there is not yet a new budget for 2011 under preparation. Shouldthis situation continue, no new expenditure decisionscan be made in2011 and the budget is likely torely on the ﬁprovisional twelfthﬂ rule, which wouldlead to a somewhat better outcome than projected.  Under the no-policy-change assumption, the headline deficit should decrease to 4.6% of GDP in2011, as VAT income will increase (partly due to the phasingout of VAT reducing measures) and (68)The government decided in 2009 to fasten the settlement of income taxes. As the federal government usually has to refund money, this measure lowers revenues.income taxes will behigher as a result of the reversal effect of the faster enrolment in theprevious year. For 2012, the deficit is expected to worsen again slightly, mainly due tohigher interestpayments and the lack of consolidation measuresspecified sofar, while the effect of ageingwill come in at a faster pace.(69)The governmentgross debt ratiois projected toincrease over the forecast period, although to a slightly lower extent than forecast in spring dueto lower interest rate assumptions in2010 and 2011. In 2010 it will reach 98½%, while in 2011 and 2012 it will surpass 100%.  The main challenges for Belgium's public financesare the correction of the excessive deficit, the reduction ofthe governmentgross debt ratio andthe improvement of the long-term sustainability ofpublic finances. Budgetary consolidationaccompanied by labour market reforms, boosting employment, should address these challenges.   (69)Age-related expenditure will increase by 0.4% of GDP in 2012 compared to 2009.2. BULGARIA Growth drivers reverse but external imbalances keep unwinding 67 Domestic demand keeps dragging economicrecovery in 2010 Bulgaria entered intorecession relatively latecompared with its neighbours. Economicactivitycontracted by 4.9% in 2009 andthedeteriorationcontinued into the first quarter of 2010, when the recessionis expectedto have bottomedout. Growth resumed in the second quarter andwill gain momentum by the end of the year. Thisunderlying growth profile would result in broadly flat real GDP for 2010as a whole. The main driving forces behind the economic turnaround includea continuedstrong export pick-up andreplenishingof inventories, while domesticdemand is expected to contract. Despite the healthy export demand, industrial output remainedat low levels. In addition, retail trade and constructionare still depressed,while credit growth isonly minimal.Graph II.2.1:Bulgaria - Inflation, current-account balance andcontributions to GDPgrowth-20-15-10-505101503040506070809101112pps.-30-20-10010% ofGDPDom. demand, excl. invent.(lhs)Inventories (lhs)Net exports (lhs)Inflation (%, lhs)Current-account balance(rhs)forecastAll components of domesticdemand are expectedto have continued to contract in 2010. The highest,albeit sharply decelerating, decline is again expected in gross fixed capital formation. Privateandgovernment consumption expenditure will belower for the year as well, decliningby3.6% and2.4%, respectively. The overall tight credit market conditions, fallingFDI inflows and continuinghousehold and corporate sector balance sheetadjustments are some of the main factors behindthe enduring negative domestic demand dynamicsin 2010.  Net exports are expected to have beenthe maingrowthdriver in 2010. Together with a build up ininventories, these should almost compensate for the negativecontribution of domestic demand.Indeed, inthe first half of 2010, exports of goods to non-euro-area and thirdcountries were veryhigh and close to their pre-crisis peaks, while exports of goods to some ofthe main EU trading partners such as Germany, Greece, and some other Member States in the region (i.e. Romania,Hungary and the Czech Republic) reached all-timehighs. As a result of exports picking upfaster, earlier and stronger than imports, the current-account deficit will continue to decline, reaching 3¼% of GDP in2010. By end-March 2010 the accumulated budgetdeficit increased to 2.4% of the full-year GDP projection under the impactof lower tax revenue(as a resultof the changinggrowth composition aswell as higher VAT and excise tax refunds) and increased social expenditure. In April-September, however, total expendituredecelerated and were1.1% lower y-o-y at the end of the third quarter, while the contractionof total revenues gradually narrowed to 6.3% y-o-y. As a result, the budget deficit is expected to improve from 4.7% of GDPin 2009 to3.8% ofGDP in 2010. Thanks to itsstrongfiscal positionprior to the crisis, Bulgaria is one of the few EU countries which plan to correcttheir excessive deficit by2011. This will beachieved without substantial increases in the tax burden (except for the increases in social security contributions and excise tax rates to comply withEU requirements) or cuts in wages and pensions. Rebound of domestic demand in 2011 After the economy's stagnation in 2010, the recovery is set to accelerate and gradually become broad-based in 2011 and 2012, with real GDPgrowth reaching 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively,underpinned by both external demand aswell as a pickupof domestic demand. With the growthcontribution of domestic demand turningpositiveagain and outpacing by far that of net exports, growthdrivers are expected to reverse and returnto a more traditional pattern for Bulgaria. The shift from external to domestic demand as the main growthdriver will stimulate imports. After collapsing by21.5% in 2009, imports of goods and services are expected to have turnedmildlypositive in2010 and to start growingfaster in2011-12. Import growth is, however, projected toEuropean Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 trail behind that of exports, resulting in a positive contribution ofnet exports togrowthover the forecast period. Investment andprivate consumption will return to positive growth next year and accelerate later on in 2012, when balance sheet adjustments of thecorporate and household sectors are at a more advancedstage. Supporting factors would besomecredit easing, improved outlook as well as higheremployment by the end of the forecast period. Theincrease in infrastructure investment, mainly dueto the absorptionof EUfunds, is expected to playa stabilisingrole and mightpartially compensate for subdued corporate investment and construction. With the rebound of real GDP growth in 2011 and importsrising once again, projected gains incompetitiveness stemming fromfurther deceleration in nominal wages and the only partial recovery in employment will prevent the trade deficit from widening again. After the massive correction of external imbalances in 2009-10, the current-account deficit is expected to remainbroadly unchanged or to slightly decline furtherover the rest of the forecast period. Given themonetary regime in place, the sustainability of this adjustment will depend crucially on the supply-side response and the ability of the economy toshift from the non-tradable to the tradable sector.

The subsequent gains in employment over the forecast period are expected tohelprecover less thanone-thirdof the crisis-inducedlosses. After decelerating considerably in 2009, real wage growth is set todecline further in2010-12. As a result of the significant fall inemployment against the backdrop of stagnatingoutput, productivity is expected to rebound strongly in 2010. The adjustment incompetitiveness should continue over the rest ofthe forecast period, albeit at a slower pace, whereby real wagegrowth is projected to be broadly in line withproductivity gains. HICP inflation should remain subdued over theforecast period at around 3% on average. However, once the global recovery gainsmomentum, the prices of oil and othercommodities in international markets couldbea further source ofpressure. In addition, core inflation is set to remain above the euro-area average over the forecast period, reflecting a certain degree of price rigidity in productmarkets.With domestic demand still contracting in 2010and recovering only gradually towards the end ofthe forecast period, a further moderate correction of the current-account deficit is projected. This, together withincreasing capital inflows linked to enhanced absorption of EU funds, should bring theeconomy's netborrowing position vis-à-vis the restof the world to slightly below ½% of GDP by2012. However, given the challenges tocompetitiveness inrecent years, it remains tobeseenhow sustainable these adjustments will be and how far they will go. The country's gross external debt, at above 100% of GDP, remains high, despitethe fact that the current-account deficit has beenfully financed through FDI. Risks to this baseline scenario are broadly balanced. Foreign capital inflows may turn out tobe larger than expected, either through a partial recovery in FDI, or through higher EU funds absorption, which would support domesticdemand and the recovery in investment. On the negativeside, given the worsening of fiscal balances, thecountry might be in a less favourable position towithstand persistent negative dynamics or further adverse shocks, should theymaterialise. At the same time, a milder-than-expectedpick up inexternal and domestic demand would result ina less pronounced reboundof economic activity. In addition, within the context of tight credit market conditions, the servicing of the economy™s high external debtmight crowd out domestic investment and spending.

Catching up is expected to slowdown While the recovery might be slightly stronger thanin other EU countries, growth in2011-12 will remain well below the pre-crisis average, thustemporarily slowing the catching-up process. Given the projected lower contribution ofFDI-driven investment to economic growthand theprotracted recovery of domestic demand, theeconomic adjustment would have to involve a shifttowards a more export-oriented growth pattern.In addition, real convergence could be enhanced byimproved competitiveness and structural reformsto boost potential growth, i.e. in the sectors of healthcare, education, pensions and publicadministration.Returning to a sounder budgetary position in 2011-12 The changing growth composition has adverselyaffected the government revenue, while the functioning of the automatic stabilisers and the accumulation of arrears has led to expenditureoverruns. The planned gradual fiscal consolidationin 2011-12 mostly relies on revenue increases induced by the expected economic recovery andthe freezing of many public expenditure items such as public sector wages and pensions, as well as cuts in some current non-interest and capitalexpenditure. Under a no-policy-changeassumption, the general government budget deficitwould be contained at 3.8% in 2010, while in 2011and 2012 it would decline to slightly below 3%and 2% of GDP, respectively. Generalgovernmentgross debt is expected to increase moderately from18¼% of GDP in 2010 to20¾% of GDP in 2012, butstill to remain one of the lowest in the EU. The risks to the budgetary projections in 2010-12are broadly balanced. The 2010 budget execution could turn out better than expected if somerecentimprovements in revenue collection andexpenditure restraint continue until the end of the year. The 2011 fiscal outcome, however, could benegatively affected if some downward risks to theunderlying growth scenariomaterialise. On therevenue side, the impact of some revenue-raising measures may be lower than expected. On theexpenditure side, social spending could increasefurther, while the envisagedcuts in items such as capital expenditure could affect the economy™smedium term potential and growthprospects.3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC Gradual recovery alongside consolidation effort 70 Former sound economic performance interrupted by the crisis The Czech economy enjoyed buoyant economicgrowth ofaround 6% onaveragein 2004-07.However, given its high degree of trade openness at the onset of the crisis, with exports representing more than 75% of GDP, the plunge in external demand had a large detrimental effect on the Czech economy. In parallel, tighter credit conditions for households and non-financialcorporations, dwindling inflows of foreigncapital and uncertain growth prospects triggered a sizeabledecline in investment. In line with the gradually improving globaleconomic environment, real GDP growth turnedpositive in the thirdquarter of2009, supportedbyrebounding exports, fiscal stimulus measures andmonetary easing. Despite the large shock to the real economyand severe stress in global financialmarkets, the Czech banking sector has remained strong. This reflects the good liquidity situation ofCzech credit institutions and low dependence on cross-border lending. A moderate economic recovery ahead The economic performance of the Czech Republic inthefirst half of 2010 was influenced by severalfactors. Firstly, the unexpectedly vigorous growthof its trading partners, Germany and Slovakia inparticular (representing more than 40% of Czech export markets), supporteda rebound in Czech export performance. Secondly, the contribution ofdomestic demand turnedpositive on the backofsignificantly higher inventory accumulation and relatively robust growth in private consumption.The Czech economy is expected to keep these growthdynamics in the second halfof 2010, alsosupported by a recovery in private investment and continuing inventory accumulation. In 2011, economic growth isnevertheless expected to slow down slightly, reflecting the impact of the consolidation measures planned in the 2011 budget and the expected deceleration of growthperformance in the Czech Republic's main trading partners. Looking further ahead, somewhat moreresilient growth is expected in 2012, fuelledmainly bystronger pick-up in households' consumption expenditure, investments andrenewed trade dynamics. Overall, real GDP isprojected to increase by 2.4% in 2010 and 2.3% in2011, and to gather pace in 2012 with growth of 3.1%. While positive, these figures are much lowerthan those of the boom phase. Given the improving conditions on the labourmarket, coupled with positive growth of disposableincome, household consumption is expected toincrease by 1.3% this year. A slight deceleration isprojected for 2011, reflecting inparticular the planned reduction in the public sector wage billand cuts in social expenditure. However, these are to be partlyoffset byafurther decrease intheunemployment rate andpositive real wagegrowthin the private sector. Investment activity continued todecrease in the first three months of 2010, with a steep decline ofmore than 5% compared to the last quarter of2009. This coincides withnegative creditgrowth in the business sector. Nevertheless,a strong rebound is expected for the rest of this year. This will be mainly driven by a temporary boom in investment into photovoltaic powerplants. The main reason for the exceptionally high investment in this sector is thatgenerousconditions in the form of a state-guaranteed price for electricity produced from solar energy willexpire at the end of this year. Overall, investment is projected todecline by 1.8% in 2010. A modest rebound inprivate investment is expected in2011, reflecting the current growth in capacityutilisation; the projected investment recovery isalso expected to be sustained by the current pick-up innew orders in industry.

The dynamics of exports are projected to slow in2011as external conditions worsen slightly, while imports will becontained by somewhat weaker domestic demand.One of the underlying assumptions of the forecastis that the Czech Republic will gradually return tothe pre-crisis pattern of gaining share on itsexportmarkets, although to a lesser extent. The current-account deficit is projected to fall slightly from itspeak in 2010 close to 2% of GDP over the forecast horizon (with a concurrentslight deterioration ofincome balance) and is not expected to pose any significant problem for the macroeconomicstability of theCzech Republic.  The forecast is subject to several risks. In particular, any unexpected developmentsconcerning the pace of recovery in the country'smain tradingpartners might result in potentiallylarge changes in export performance in both directions. A stronger-than-expected impact of consolidation measures envisaged in2011mighthave negative implications especially forhousehold consumption expenditure.Labour market gaining some momentum Following the crisis in 2009, the Czechlabourmarket experienced one of the highest increases inthe unemployment rate in the EU, rising from4.4% in 2008 to 6.7% in2009. However, the unemployment rate seems already to have peaked in the first quarter of 2010 and is expected to reach 7.3%for this year. Nevertheless, conditions on the labour market are expected to be slightly worsened in 2011 by fiscal austerity measures, inparticular by cuts in the public sectorwage bill. This will beimplemented partly via a reduction in the numberof public sector employees at the centralgovernment level. Labour demand in theprivate sectorwill also remain fragile. Unemployment istherefore projected todecline only moderately, to around 7% in 2011. Further improvement isexpected in2012, supported by strongerdomesticeconomic activity and improvement in external conditions. Furthermore, the government currently envisages several labour market reforms with the aim ofincreasing its flexibility. If properly designed and implemented, these could contribute to limiting the risks of post-crisis hysteresis effects and help to lower long-term unemployment.  Inflation driven by administrative changes in2011 Following a sharp one-off increase in 2008, HICP inflationdecelerated substantially in 2009, to0.6%, alsodue to a decline in core inflation during the economic downturn. The gradual economicrecovery is set to drive inflation to about 1.2% in 2010. In the following years, price pressures will be contained by the generally low pressuresstemming from the demand side, moderate wagegrowth and the likely further appreciation of the Czech currency. Nevertheless, somepro-inflationary pressures will stem from the expected increase in electricity prices as a result of the above- mentioned state guaranteed price for solar energy and an increase in natural gas prices. At the same time, food commodity prices are set to continueto rise in 2011.Overall, HICP inflation is projected to rise to 2.1% in 2011, whereas the core inflation is expected to be rather subdued. For2012, improvingdomestic demand will result in only a slight increase in the inflation rate to2.2%, also due to lower expected contribution of administrative and regulatory changes whencompared with 2011.  Further steps towards correcting the fiscal
imbalances The situation of the Czech public finances is expected to improve over the forecast horizon, duelargely to the relatively significant consolidation efforts made by the government.

Budgetary execution in2010 has so far developedbroadly in line with plans, with a few exceptions. These occurred mainly on the revenue side: thecentral budget revenue from income taxes and social contributions appears to be lower thanexpected. Central government expenditure hasbroadly followed the budgetary plans but higher-than-expected deficits in local governments and social security funds are likely to add some ½ pp. to the general government deficit in 2010. Faced with these revenue shortfalls and expenditure slippages, the government took additionalconsolidation measures in the course of the year, amounting to around 0.5% of GDP.These mainly included cuts in centralgovernment operational expenditure. On the other hand, better thanexpected developmentsinsovereign risk premiatook place throughout 2010, resulting in lower interest expenditure than originally planned. Consequently, the generalgovernment deficit is projected todecrease to 5.2% of GDP in2010. The consolidation effort is set to continue in 2011, focusing predominantly onthe expenditure side.Expenditure growth is projected tobe significantlylower than nominal GDP growth, resultingina reductionof the expenditure-to-GDP ratio byaround 1 pp. Revenue growth, while lower than in2010, will broadly mirror nominal GDP growth. The forecast takes into account the consolidation measures taken into account in thebudget submitted to the Parliament. The mainconsolidation measures for 2011include cuts in the public sectorwagebill, cuts in some social benefits, reduction of government subsidies toconstruction savings and further cuts incurrentexpenditure bythe public sector. In 2011, the general government deficit is expected to fall to4.6%of GDP. The deficit is likely to decrease further in 2012, as the government plans tocontinuefiscal consolidation in line with the recommendations under the excessive deficit procedure. While the overall expenditure ceilingshave already been set, concrete measures on theexpenditure andrevenue side are not yet known.Therefore, under the no-policy-change assumption,the government deficit is forecast to decreasefurther to 4.2% of GDP in 2012, on the back ofaccelerating economic activity. Consolidation measures will furthermore contribute to reducing the pace of public debtincrease. The debt-to-GDP ratio was 35½% GDP in 2009 and is expected to reach approximately45% of GDP in 2012. 4. DENMARK Domestic demand drives the recovery 73 The recovery remains on track– After contracting by 5.2% in 2009, the Danisheconomy has rebounded strongly, with real GDPgrowth expected to reach2.3% in2010. Therecovery has been driven mainlybydomesticdemand and a strong inventory rebound.Government interventions to cushion the negative effect of the crisis on the labour market and on confidence contributed to the rather swift turn-around.  The recovery is expected to lose somemomentumin the secondhalf of this year. Real GDP growth is then forecast to revert to a more moderate path, with annual rates of 1.9% in 2011 and 1.8% in2012.  –supported by domestic demand– Income tax cuts have lifted household realdisposable income in 2010(whichfell in 2009) and have started tofeed into private consumption,which is expected to increase by about 2% per year until 2012. The household saving rate, which increased in 2008-10, is set to revert gradually towards pre-crisis levels. Consumer confidence hasimproved markedly since the end of last year and already exceeds its long-termaverage.  The improvement in investment is forecast to be gradual. Following the slump in 2009, investmentgrowth is expected to remain negative in 2010 asgovernment stimulus measures will not fullycompensate for lacklustre private investment.Investment growth rates will be close to 2% in2011 and3%in 2012. Rising capacity utilisationand the restoration of corporations' profitabilityfollowing the sharp contraction in2009 will lendparticular support to higher investment inequipment. The situationon the Danish housingmarket is also expected to improve gradually overthe next two years. After the slump in2009 and this year, housing investment is projected tobeflat in 2011 and toturnpositive only in2012.  Gradual fiscal consolidationwill lead to a decline in the growth rate of government expenditure. Following a 1½% rise this year, governmentexpenditure is forecast to shrink slightly in 2011 and rise only modestly in 2012 as the government has announced its firm intention to keep a tight lid on expenditure and toprevent spending overruns.Inparticular, amendments to the waymunicipalitiesare financed and their expenditure is controlled shouldhelp to ensure a closer matchbetween budgeted and disbursed amounts.

The rapid and robust recovery inGermany and Sweden, Denmark's main trading partners, bodes well for the export sector, and inparticular for producers of intermediate goods that feed into international value chains. The agricultural and pharmaceutical sectors, although less exposed to cyclical fluctuations, are also likelyto face higher demand. Overall, despite a decreasing trend over the medium-term, themerchandise trade balance is expected to remainpositive. At the same time, Denmark's competitivemaritime transport sectorwill provide a platformfor a strongrebound in services exports, as worldtrade volumes continue topickup after the crisis.  On the back of a positive trade balance and increasing revenues onforeign investments, thecurrent-account surplus is substantial andprojectedto remain around 4% of GDP over the entire forecast horizon, i.e. close to the 2009 level. However, the current-account surplus masks theincreasing divergence between the declining merchandise and the risingservices trade balances. In particular, the apparent deterioration inDenmark's cost competitiveness position vis-à-vis its main tradingpartners is weighing on goods European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
exports. Relatively weak total labour productivity 
growth over the past decade and sharp wage 

increases during the boom years have led to 

soaring unit labour costs. The fall in unit labour 

costs forecast for 2010, due to wage moderation 
and a rebound in productivity, will be insufficient 
to counterbalance the sharp 
rise recorded in 2009. 
Moreover, with the gradual improvement in the 

economy over the coming years, wage growth is 
expected to approach hist
orical averages in 2011 and 2012. These projected productivity and wage 

developments will exert upward pressure on unit 
labour costs over the fo
recast horizon and hence 
hold back the restoration of Denmark's external 
cost competitiveness.  
Against this backdrop, further euro appreciation Œ 
and thus of the Danish krone Œ might have 
additional negative short-term effects on the export 
sector, even though the well-diversified export 
product mix reduces the sensitivity of exports to 

exchange rate fluctuations.  
Inflation is set to decelerate Measures introduced earlier this year Œ higher 

indirect taxes, penalising the consumption of high 

energy and unhealthy products (tobacco, high-

sugar-content soft drinks, high-fat foods, etc.), 

a rise in several environmental taxes and 

a reduction in the number of transactions under the 
reduced VAT rate Œ will have a significant impact 
on headline inflation. Inflation is forecast to rise 
from 1.1% in 2009 to 2.2% in 2010 with the effect 
of higher indirect taxes assumed to contribute 
more than ½ pp. to headline inflation in 2010. As 
the tax effect on inflation will peter out in the 
course of 2011, inflation will fall marginally and 
stabilise around 2% in 2011-12.  
Overall, services inflation is assumed to be the 
most important contributor to the headline rate, 
also as a result of relatively lower competition in 
the services sector. Core inflation is set to increase 
to almost 2% in 2011 from 1½% this year, before 
receding slightly
 in 2012.  Unemployment is forecast to decrease in 2011 The Danish labour market has performed far better 

than expected at the onset of the crisis. 

Unemployment has increased from 3½% in 2008 

to just below 7% in 2010 but is expected to peak at 

the end of 2010. Although the rise in 

unemployment has been substantial, the flexible 
Danish labour market system and active labour 
market policies are expected
 to limit the risk of 
a rise in long-term and structural unemployment.  
Population ageing, with fewer people in the 
working age group, will reduce the size of the 

labour force already this 
year. The composition of 
the labour force will also change, with a growing 
share of people with lower employment rates, such 
as older and younger worker
s as well as workers of 
foreign origin. Looking forward, demographic 
trends might put pressure on the labour market in 

the years ahead.   
Public finances still expansionary in 2010– The fiscal consolidation 
and structural reforms 
implemented before the onset of the crisis 

provided the authorities with room for manoeuvre 

to support the economy during the crisis through 

expansionary fiscal policy and financial sector 

stabilisation measures.  
The budget deficit is for
ecast to increase to about 
5% of GDP in 2010, as automatic stabilisers are 

allowed to work freely, stimulus measures from 

the 2010 fiscal bill are implemented and the tax 

cuts from the latest tax reform lower income taxes, 

negatively affecting revenue.  
–but consolidation is set to start from 2011 As the recovery gets under way in 2011 and the 

extraordinary high level of public investments 

normalises, the government expenditure ratio is 

expected to decline. Th
e recovery should also 
trigger an increase in government revenues as 

some of the financing elements from the 2010 tax 
reform, including increased green taxes and 
business taxes, become operational and the growth 
in private consumption leads to higher revenue 
from indirect taxes.  
On top of the phasing out of the temporary 
measures introduced to counter the negative effects 
of the crisis, the Danish government has secured 
parliamentary support for a set of fiscal 
consolidation measures designed to decrease the 
budget deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2013. The 
consolidation measures are set to work from 2011 
to 2013, and include spending adjustments, 
suspension of automatic
 adjustments of the 
thresholds for income taxes, postponement of 
income tax cuts and the reduction in the duration

GERMANY Rebalancing under way as the upswing keeps momentum 76 Sound fundamentals support a speedy andbroad-based recovery The German economy has recovered remarkably swiftlyand vigorously fromthe crisis, posting six consecutive quarters of above-potential growth. In spring 2010, real GDP advanced by over 2%, thehighest rate since unification followedby a further gainof ¾% in the thirdquarter. The value of exports is back topre-crisis levels. Employmentgrowthhas been only temporarily dentedby thedownturn. Capacity utilisation has almost returned to its long-term average. Most of the output loss incurred during the crisis has beenalready reversed. Moreover, the initially predominantlyexport- and inventory-driven recovery has given way to a broad-based upswing, withprivate consumption and investment contributing more strongly togrowth in the secondquarter than netexports.

First and foremost, Germany was hit bythe economic crisis primarily in the form of an exogenous, temporary trade shock, whereas its economic fundamentals were essentially soundafter an extended period of structural adjustments. Unlike other countries, Germany had notexperienced any domestic housing, assetor creditboom prior to the crisis. Moreover, major structural reforms had been carried out in the2000s, rendering the German labour market more flexible, improving competitiveness andstrengtheningthe profitability of companies. As a result, the German economy has been able to fully benefitfrom the incipient globalrecovery. It is not being held backby the need to address domestic imbalances or to repair private and publicbalance sheets. Finally, with its specialisation incapital goods, the German export sector wasparticularly well placed to benefit from thedemand boomin emerging markets. Even though export dynamics are assumedto slowdown after the growth spurt in 2010, the economic upswing is expected to largely maintain its momentum. Fiscal consolidation will start in 2011, but is likely to imply only a limited moderation of growth. With a buoyant labour market and favourable financing conditions, domestic demand can be expected to react much more dynamically tothe export-led upswing than was previously the case. This would also lead to a more balanced growth composition and imply a steady decline in the current-account surplus. Private consumption and investment sustain growth momentum Apart from a temporary soft patch in the secondhalfof2009 following the expiry of the carscrappage premium, private consumption was an important stabilising factor during the crisis,benefiting from past employment gains, higherwage growth and household relief measures as part of the fiscal stimulus. A vibrant labour market and a steady decline in unemployment will continue to boost private consumption,as will a pick-up in wagegrowth and still-contained inflation. The household saving rate is not expected torise anyfurther, given that its drop inthe wake of the post-unification consumption boom has largely beenreversed. Hikes in social security contributions andother fiscal consolidation measures are projected to moderate private consumption growth onlytemporarily in the beginning of 2011. Rebounding strongly in2010, investment isprojected to remain buoyant in the coming years.Corporate spending on equipment is catching upfrom the severe slump in2009. Many companies had put investment plans onhold during the crisis. Given the stronger-than-expected rebound, manyof these projects are now being implemented.Structural shifts in demand associated with the crisis, for example in the car industry, require additional investment in the modernisationofproduction facilities. The sharp rise in capacityMember States, Germany utilisation has also increased the need to extend existing capacities. Capital formation alsobenefits from relatively favourable financing conditionsand the strong financialposition of the corporate sector. The expiry of favourable depreciation rulesfor companies at the end of 2010 is set to give an extra push to equipment investment, followed,though, by a correction in the beginning of nextyear.  A decline in real interest rates in Germany andlower capital exports from Germany after the end of asset and housing boomsabroad shouldfurtherhelp overcome the protracted period of weak domestic investment. This could also buoy housinginvestment, especially as many alternativeinvestment opportunities have become relativelyless attractive in the aftermath of the crisis. The favourable labour market outlook and rising household incomes should further support stronger housing investment in the future. With bothhousehold and corporate savings projected tomoderate somewhat over the forecast horizon, thispick-up inhousing and corporate investment would also imply a gradual reduction in the current-account surplus. Lower growth contribution from net exports  The swift turnaroundof the German economy after the crisis is largely due to the quick recovery ofworld trade and the strong competitiveness ofGermany's export sector. Strong export growth in2010 has laid the basis for improved capacity utilisation, resilience of the labour market and more dynamic private consumption and investment growth going forward. Somemoderation of exportgrowth is projected for 2011 and 2012, reflecting still relatively weakdemandfrom some key trading partners which are exiting the crisis more slowly and a certain normalisation of the situation after the sharp post-crisis bounce-back in global trade.  
Given the rising import content of German exportsand a noticeable pick-up indomestic demand,imports are projected to growfaster than exports in 2011-12. As a result, the growth contribution of net exports would move close to zero and thebalance of trade in goods and services wouldgradually approach a surplus of around 4¼% by2012. Given the importance of the export sector, thecontinued recovery of world trade will remaincrucial to sustain the upswingof the Germaneconomy, including domestic demand. A sharper-than-expected deceleration of foreign demand, disruptive exchange rate developments or a surge in protectionist  tendencies pose downside risks tothe current growthoutlook and could imply a setback to the ongoingrecovery.

To a large extent thishas been dueto enhancedworking-time flexibility at companylevel and the increased use of short-time workschemes. In addition, past labour market reformsand severalyears of wage moderation havearguably reduced the level of structural unemployment in Germany andhave facilitatedmore dynamic employmentgrowth, especiallyinsome lower-wage and service sectors.Consequently, employment and unemploymentdynamics inGermany have very quickly and seamlessly returned to pre-crisis trends, with the unemployment rate havingfalling below its pre-crisis level already by mid-2010. The stronggrowthoutlook for 2011 and 2012will translate into further falls in unemployment Œapproaching a rate of 6% towards the end of the forecast horizon Œ and further employment creation. Especially in 2010and Œ to a lesser extentŒ also in 2011, the rise in headcount employment will be mitigatedby a rebound in average working hours. In the light of negative demographic trends andoverall stagnation in terms of educational77 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 outcomes, the projected strong labour demandcould lead to shortages at least in certain sectors and especially for high-skilled workers. Considerable regional differences inunemployment rates also contribute to an increasedtightness in the German labour market. This will imply stronger wage pressure, but can also becomean increasingly important bottleneck to growth and constitutes a non-negligible risk factorfor the growthoutlook. Increased labour market tightnesscould also entail a shift tomore capital-intensive production and therebyunderpin the expectedsurge in investment. Wage growth picking up, while inflation remains contained In line with stronger economic growth and a progressively tightening labour market, wage growth is projected to accelerate. In 2010, higherper-capita wage growth is still, to a large extent, driven by higher average working hours withunderlying wage agreements remaining fairly moderate. Recent wage agreements, however, also point to a pick-up in collectively-agreedwage rates from 2011 onward. As a result, nominal unitlabour costs are projected to rise by around 1% per year in2011 and 2012. HICP inflation is projected topick up from 2011onwards but to remain relatively contained at around 1¾% and 2% in 2011 and 2012. Higherinflation in 2011 reflects in particular a hike inenergy prices due to lagged effects from higher oilprices in 2010 and higherelectricity prices. Rising wage pressures and a progressive closing of theoutputgap are also expected to contribute tosomewhat higher inflation in2012. Strong upswing Œ but growth bottlenecks are looming As argued above, the economic upswing inGermany is supported by sound economicfundamentals and the lack of any major domesticimbalances and balance sheet problems. Furtherstabilisation of the banking sector Œ especially inlight of new regulatory requirements Œ and completing the restructuring of the Landesbankenremain important near-term challenges, especially with a view to ensure adequate access to finance for the household and corporate sectors.Emerging shortages in the labour market are proneto become a major bottleneck to growth in the medium term. Further rises in participation andemployment rates, especially among womenand older workers, would help counternegative demographic trends. Moreover, improvements inaccess to, and quality of, education as well as an increase inhigher educational attainment rates would contribute to providing a pool ofhigh-skilled workers sufficient to underpin Germany's comparative advantage in high-value-added industries. This could also help reverse thetrendoffalling productivity growth inGermany  Government deficit rises in 2010 but less than
expected The generalgovernment deficit is projected toincrease further to 3¾% of GDP in2010, stilldrivenby the measures undertaken to support the economic recovery. While some of the discretionary measures undertakenin 2009havealready expired (e.g. car-scrapping premium),others have continued in 2010 generating an evenstronger budgetary impact. For example, thereduced contributionrate tohealth-care insurance, initially introduced as of mid-2009, will reveal its full impact only in 2010. Moreover, somemeasures have come into effect with a lag, e.g. additional infrastructure investment, or have only been introduced as of 2010, e.g. tax deductibilityof contributions to health-care and long-term care insurance. In addition, the German authoritiesintroduced new fiscal measures as of 2010 (around ¼% of GDP), including increased child allowanceand child benefit, modification of parts of thecorporate tax reform, changes to the inheritance tax and a reduced 7% VAT rate on hotels and restaurants. The impact of one-off measures Œdeficit-increasingfinancial market stabilisationmeasures and deficit-decreasing revenue fromthe UMTS auction Œ is likely tobalance out.

Moreover, as of 2011, the German government isto start fiscal consolidation at federal level, as implied by the new constitutional budgetary rule, which prescribes astructural deficitceiling of0.35% of GDP for the Federal government from2016onwards and balanced structural budgets for the Länder as of2020.  In 2011, the general government deficit is forecast to diminish to below 3% ofGDP benefiting frommore favourable cyclical conditions and federal fiscal consolidation measures (around¼% of GDP), the expiry of certain stimulus measures(around ¼%of GDP) and health-care reform(around ½% of GDP), including a 0.6 pp. increase in the contribution rate to finance rising health-care costs. Based on the no-policy-changeassumption, the forecast does not take into account measures that have not yet been fully specified. The major 2011 measures encompass reducedsocial benefits for long-term unemployed, cuts in public sector wages, as well as a new tax on thenuclear energy sector and anair traffic charge. The deficit is set to decline further in2012, tobelow 2% of GDP, also onthe back of the expiryof certain stimulus measures, e.g. additional investment. Gross debt is projected to increasefrom 73¼% of GDP in 2009 to76% ofGDP in 2011, alsodue to the asset transfer from one of the Landesbanken into a bad bank.(70) Establishment of further bad banks might additionally burdenGermany™s public finances in the short- andmedium-term.The debt-to-GDP ratio will fall to75¼% of GDP in 2012, mainly due to a favourable denominator effect.  The envisaged federal consolidation appears to be largely growth-friendly Œ e.g. previously agreedincreases in the R&D and education expenditure have beenring-fenced. However, the increase in the health-care insurance contribution rate would add to the already high tax wedge. Reconciling fiscal adjustment with raisingpotential growth, includingby further improving the composition ofgovernment budgets, will therefore constitute a challenge for public finances in the years ahead. (70)The establishment of the "bad-bank" for one of the Landesbanken is assumed to have a direct impact on the debt. This treatment follows the practice currently used by the German statistical authorities. The forecast does not take into account the effects of another "bad-bank"establishment due to the lack of sufficient details.  6. ESTONIA Post-crisis acceleration of growth 80 Robust growth since end-2009– Following seven consecutive quarters of decline, the Estonian economy turned to positive quarterly growth at the end of 2009 and reachedpositive annual growthrates by mid-2010. Quarterly growthwas particularly robust in the secondquarter of 2010, whenitreached 1.9% (seasonallyand working day adjusted), the fastest since early 2007, while annual growth reached 4.7%in thethird quarter of the year, according to the latest available information. The prospects of euro adoption in 2011, confirmed in July 2010, havebeen clearly supportivefor overall confidence in the Estonian economy. So far the main contribution to growthhas comefrom external trade, as Estonia's main exportpartners Œ inparticular Sweden, but also euro-areaeconomies, the other Baltics and Russia Œhavebeengrowing more strongly than previouslyexpected. The flexible nature of the Estonian economy and the availability of factors ofproduction allowed Estoniato benefit promptly fromthis rebound. The adjustment in costs thattook place in 2009 also contributed to the improved competitiveness of the economy,allowing Estonia to increase its share in globaltrade.  While exports provided the main growth stimulus, domestic demand continued to act as a drag on the economy until mid-2010, with the exceptionofstocks. The latter, extensively run downduringcrisis years, were rebuilt to support expandingexternal demand, contributing strongly to overall growth in the first half of 2010. Resumption of growth in fixed investment has been uneven, witha firmer recovery in investment in equipment. Onthe other hand, government investment was lower than expected in the first halfof 2010. –is expected to continue in the short term, with stronger demand contributing to somereversal in the current account– External demand is expected to remain one of theprincipal determinantsof growthin 2011and2012, with exports growing broadly in line withdemand growth in Estonia's main export markets. Private consumption is projected to startsupporting the recovery towards the endof 2010, even though the full-year contribution will likelyremain negative. While positive annual growth is expected to resume in 2011-12, it will remainsignificantly below levels observed inpre-crisis years. Nevertheless, private consumption is set tobenefit from demand that has been postponed due tohighprecautionarysaving during the crisis, inparticular in 2009, while growth in householddisposable incomeis expected to turn positive from 2011. The household saving rate, whiledecreasing, shouldremain positive over the forecast horizon, contrary to the pre-crisis trend, as households continue torepay accumulatedliabilities. Uncertainty around the saving behaviour ofhouseholdsconstitutes one of major risks to the forecast, both on the upside and on the downside.

The growth in investment is expectedto accelerate in2011 and remain robust in 2012. Increasing external and domestic demand can be satisfied partly by redeploying existing capacity: although the utilisation rate reached its long-term average by the third quarter of2010, surveys stillpoint to availability of spare capacity. However, itis likely that some available capacity, which will notbe suitable to support the new growthphase givenongoingshifts in the output mix, will need to be replaced.  This implies an acceleration inequipment investment in the short term, inparticular for new product lines. The extent towhich fixed investment rebounds following theenormous contraction in 2008-2009 depends Member States, Estonia 
largely on financial sector confidence and lending 
policy, as well as on the firming of the economic 

outlook, thus constituting another uncertainty in 

the forecast. 
Recovery in both external and internal demand has 
led to a pickup in import growth rates. This trend 
is expected to continue in 2011 and 2012, reducing 
somewhat the high level of current-account surplus 

recorded in 2009. Moreover, recovering 

profitability of companies in foreign ownership 

will lead to a larger income account shortfall, with 

a significant part of these profits being reinvested. 
Overall this is expected to lead to annual GDP 
growth higher than what was predicted in the 

previous forecast, at 2.4%
 in 2010, accelerating to 4.4% in 2011 and at 3.5% in 2012. This growth 

acceleration reflects a re-employment of available 

production capacity, both capital and labour, but 
also new investment.  
–but can it be sustained in the medium and 
long term? The current growth accelerat
ion largely relates to the closure of the significant negative output gap 
that emerged as a result 
of a combination of the 

global financial crisis and reversal of the domestic 

cycle. The negative output gap is estimated to be 

over 10% of GDP in 2009, twice the level reached 
during the recession in the late 90s. However, the 
question remains of how much spare potential is 
left in the economy, given that part of the existing 
production capacity may no longer be usable after 
the crisis and the readju
stment of the economy. 
The crisis also probably 
impacted on the level of 
potential growth. The extent to which the current 
high level of unemployment becomes structural 
will be a significant determinant of potential 
growth in the medium and long term.  In addition, 
the contribution to potential growth from capital 
accumulation, while gradually rising, will remain 
substantially lower than during the peak years of 
the previous cycle, including due to servicing 

accumulated liabilities. The contribution to growth 

from improvements in technology, which was 

likewise very high during the peak years of the 

cycle, is highly uncertain looking forward. Overall, 

this implies that potential growth will stay rather 

subdued in Estonia in th
e coming years, reaching 
barely a third of its pre-crisis rate in the medium 
term. 
Further challenges: labour market– After peaking at 20.4% in early 2010, 
unemployment (15-64) started to decline very 

rapidly to 19.2% by the spring and 15.7% at end-

September. Job creation has been high since March 

2010, highlighting the flexibility of the labour 

market and the quality and speed of job 
intermediation. The fall in unemployment is 
expected to decelerate du
ring the winter months, 
before gaining pace again 
later in 2011, in line 

with the projected accelera
tion in growth. In 2009, 
nominal hourly wages contracted by around 3% 

for the whole economy, while hourly wages in 
public administration declined by around 5%. This 
decline has, however, reversed in 2010 and 

moderate nominal wage growth can be expected in 

both 2011 and 2012. 
Efforts are being made to further raise the 
effectiveness of active labour market policies, in 
particular: job mediation and job search guidance 
efforts; measures to support job creation and 

recruitment; and measures to preserve or restore 

employability. Nevertheless, structural 

unemployment is set to continue to rise in Estonia 

over the forecast horizon, potentially leading to 

premature wage pressures. In addition, the 

availability of employment opportunities in other 

EU countries could lead to a fall in the 
economically active po
pulation, exposing 
bottlenecks as labour demand rises. 
–and rising prices After a very low consumer 
price increase (0.2%) in 2009, HICP inflation has been on an upward trend 

since the beginning of 2010. While initially the 

increase mostly related to surges in energy prices, 

including hikes in excise duties from July 2009 

and January 2010, food prices have also started to 
increase since early 2010. The latter reflected not 
only a rise in global food prices, but increasingly 
also a magnified domestic response to global 
trends, possibly related to corporate intentions of 
restoring profit margins after substantial losses, 
small market size and the prevalence of short-term 
contracts. Furthermore, growing food exports to 
Russia, following adverse weather conditions there 

in summer 2010, have reduced domestic supply in 

Estonia.  
Overall, global commodity price developments and 
more limited domestic price pressures are expected 
to lead to inflation of 2.7% in 2010, which is 
expected to accelerate to
 3.6% in 2011 before

Domestic factors areset toplay anincreasingly prominent role inprice developments in2011 and 2012.Given thehistoryof relatively high inflation in Estonia prior to the last downturn, there is a risk that current inflationdevelopmentsmay affect expectations and,hence,weigh on private consumption and recovery.Public finances: uneven pattern in comingyears but overall sound As a result ofadverse economic developments in 2008 and 2009, tax revenue fell, while general government expenditure as a share of GDPincreased by over 10 pps. in two years, reaching a highof 45% of GDP in 2009. Comprehensivefiscal consolidation, implemented especially from the secondhalf of 2009, helped to limit thedeterioration of public finances and was achievedthough a combination of permanent measures, which constituted around two-thirdsof totalconsolidation, and some temporary measures to deal with the more extreme Œ but also temporary Œ effects of the crisis. As the economy improves, some of these temporary measures will start toexpire. This in particular relates to the resumptionof state contributions to the funded mandatory pension scheme and to lower dividends from state-owned companies in 2011 and 2012, compared totheir level in 2009 and 2010. However, this reversal is not expected to lead to a pronounceddeterioration in public finances. The near-term fiscal outlook is markedly affected by sizeable sales of so-called "Kyoto units".(71)These transactions, signedin the course of 2010, considerably improve the outlook for public finances in that year, while environmental investments funded by the sales will have anopposite impact in 2011 and2012. Without the impact of those sales, the headline generalgovernment deficit would have been fairly stableover the forecast period, at2.0% of GDP in 2010, 1.6% in2011 and 2.1% in 2012. The outlook for the general governmentdebtlevel, which increases to 11.7% of GDP in 2012, reflects an assumption that the deficit will be fully financedby new borrowing, although inpractice part of the deficit could be financed throughrunning down existing reserves. (71)An Assigned Amount Unit (AAU) is a tradable 'Kyoto unit' or 'carbon credit' representing an allowance to emit greenhouse gases. AAUs are issued up to the level specified in Annex 1 Party to the Kyoto Protocol. Due to the initial comparison basis, Estonia received a higher quota amount than needed given the current structure of the economy, and is able to sell the surplus of the CO2 quota allocated for the 2008-12 commitment period.7. IRELAND Painful but necessary adjustment to facilitate gradual recovery 
83 Domestic real estate boom turned into 
financial sector crisis Ireland is currently undergoing a period of 
unavoidable and severe adjustment after the crisis 

brought to an end the build-up of imbalances 

during the preceding boom years. These had been 

marked by high domestic demand-driven growth 

on the back of an unsustainable housing boom, 
financed through rapid credit growth. This also 
entailed a sharp expansion in banks' balance sheets 
and high private sector indebtedness. 
A light touch regulatory framework tolerated 
a concentration of lending to residential 

construction and property development resulting in 
an over-exposure of some Irish banks to these 
sectors. The rapid credit expansion also led to high 
dependence of Irish banks on international 
wholesale financing, implying vulnerabilities on 
the liabilities side of banks' balance sheets.  
A sharp adjustment in the Irish real estate market 
started after the 2006 peak and has since spread to 
the wider economy. This development has been 
amplified by the decline in global demand and 

especially by the recession in the main trading 
partners (euro area, US and UK) of the very open 
Irish economy, as well as by the international 
financial crisis. Between the end of 2007 and the 
end of 2009, employment fell by nearly 12% and 
real GDP declined by over 14%, despite being 
buoyed by net exports. The crisis has also led to 
a dramatic deterioration in the Irish public 

finances, with a double-digit general government 

deficit emerging and feeding into a steep increase 
in the debt ratio from its low pre-crisis level 
despite considerable consolidation efforts.  
Moreover, in the course of 2010, the extent to 
which Irish banks' excessive exposure to the 

construction sector has weakened them after the 

bursting of the real estate market bubble led to 
drastic valuation losses has become increasingly 
visible. Starting in 2008, the Irish authorities had 
put in place several measures
 to support the sector, 
including a blanket guarantee, large capital 

injections, the full nationalisation of one bank, and 
the establishment of the National Asset 
Management Agency (NAMA), a "bad bank" to 
deal with banks' property
-related impaired assets. 
The need to support the vulnerable financial sector 
has greatly exacerbated the deterioration in the 
public finances. Uncertainty about the total cost of 
the support and its implications for the 
sustainability of public finances led to increasing 
nervousness in bond markets in the second half of 
2010, reflected in soaring Irish sovereign-bond 

spreads. In response, the Irish authorities presented 

in late November their detailed and comprehensive 

four-year fiscal consolidation plan to stabilise debt 

developments and reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP 
by 2014. While inevitably imposing some pain, 
this plan aims at restoring confidence Œ 
a prerequisite for the return to sustainable growth Œ 
and will thereby shape economic developments 
over the forecast horizon.  
Strong exports lead return to economic growth In 2010, a further small decline in GDP is 
expected. Thereafter, the economy is projected to 

return to moderate grow
th, with some acceleration 
expected in 2012. By hist
orical standards (which are inflated by Ireland's
 successful catching up 
process and the unsustainable real estate boom), 
the projected growth is very modest. This reflects 
the drawn-out adjustment process, during which 
domestic demand is expected to continue to act as 
a drag on growth, while exports should continue to 
drive the recovery.  
Following the historic drop in household 
consumption in 2009, further moderate declines 
are expected over the forecast horizon. 
Households' deleveraging efforts should continue 

to weigh on their demand throughout the forecast 
period, while the declines in consumption would 
also reflect reductions in disposable income on 

account of subdued labour market developments in 

2010-11. Albeit partly offset by positive 

confidence effects, fiscal
 consolidation measures 
should also have a dampening impact. 
Gross fixed capital formation is expected to have 
further declined by around one fifth in 2010. It 
should see another smaller reduction in 2011 and 
stabilise in 2012. While softening, the ongoing 
drastic downsizing of the construction sector is 
only expected to come to 
an end in 2012, also on 
the back of planned further reductions in public 
investment. This should be progressively offset by 

a moderate pick-up in equipment and machinery 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 investment once confidence has been restored and prospects improve.  Net exports are expected to make strongpositive contributions to growth throughout the forecast horizon.In2009, Irish exports haddeclined only modestly, mainly reflecting their composition,notably a large share of a-cyclical chemicals,notably pharmaceuticals, in goods exports. In the first half of 2010, they benefitted strongly from thepick-up inglobal trade and should expand byaround 5¾% for the year asa whole. On the backof continued growth in export markets and theongoing recovery of past competitiveness losses through domestic price and wage adjustments, exports should continue to grow markedly in2011Œ12. Imports should be heldback by subdueddomestic demand developments over theforecast horizon, implying stronggrowth contributionsfromthe external sector and a return to a moderate current-account surplus by the end of the forecast horizon.Graph II.7.1:Ireland- GDP growth andcontributions-14-12-10-8-6-4

On the external side, Ireland's position as a price-taker in international markets implies that export prospects are strongly influenced by exchange rate developments especially vis-à-vis USD and GBP(36% of Irishgoods exports in 2009 went to theUS and the UK). Domestically, there is uncertaintyonhow quickly and strongly positive confidence effects of fiscalconsolidation could kick in, eventually supporting domestic demand. Further, a domestic upturn is conditional on the ability ofa viable banking sector toextend credit to theeconomy. Subdued lending activity on account of slower-than-expected restructuring in the sectorcould have a detrimental impact on investment. At the same time, a faster-than-assumed pace of sectoral adjustmentmight provide support toconsumption and investment demand.  Correction of imbalances key for recovery While the government's four-year strategyclearly sets out plans to consolidate the public finances, the pace of recovery will also depend on the speed of correction of other imbalances accumulated inthe past. Notably, the forecast assumes progress in the domestic rebalancing of economicactivityfrom construction to more productive sectors, inthe clean-up of household and corporate balance sheets as well as further regaining ofcompetitiveness. At the peak of the housing market cycle in 2006, the construction sector accounted for over 13% of total employment, nearly double the average share in the euro area. The shrinking of the constructionsector and the wider recession have been reflected in a large decline in employment, whichhas hit young and low-skilledworkers hardest. The rise inthe unemployment rate has been limited bya marked fall in the participationrate and the return to net outward migration after over a decade of significant inflows. Even after the projectedpeak in the unemployment rate at close to 13¾% in 2010, further sizeable net emigration is expectedover the forecast horizon. The export-led recoveryand capital-intensive production inkey exportsectors imply a very gradual improvement inlabour market conditions, lagging more than usual next year's expectedreturnto positive economicgrowth.

TheIrish price level was among the highest in the euroarea in recent years. A downward adjustment of 84 Member States, Ireland prices is underway; at around -1½% for the GDP deflator and HICP, disinflation continued in 2010. While inflation is projected to return to positive territory in 2011-12, it should remain subdued in the absence of strong demand pressures. Nominal wage adjustment is also taking place, led by corresponding cuts in the public sector now feeding through to the private sector. Wagedevelopments are projected to be very moderate in 2011-12, thereby helping to recover pastcompetitiveness losses and facilitating sectoral adjustment.  Balance-sheet adjustments are likely to continue toweigh ondomestic demand over the next few years. After the steep increase in 2009, thehousehold saving rate is expected to decline onlygradually over the forecast horizon. While confidence should improve and reduce precautionary savings, the highly indebtedhousehold sector's need for further deleveragingfollowing the endof the housing boom willpreventa more marked drop. Further deleveragingand restructuring in the banking sector will alsobenecessary following past excessive exposure to the construction sector and over-reliance on international wholesale funding. While this mightweigh on credit supply in the short term, the non-financial corporate sector's demand for investment credit should also remain subdued overthe same period. The measures put inplace by thegovernment, including guarantees and NAMA,shouldhelp facilitate a further orderlyrestructuring.Ambitious but realistic consolidation plans The Irish public finances have been hit hard by the economic and financial crisis. The sharp deterioration of the generalgovernment balance from a smallsurplus in2007 to a double-digitdeficit ratio in 2009 reflects several factors: a shift away fromtax-rich domestic demand drivengrowth; the rigidity of the expenditure plans giventhe sharpdecline in revenue; as well as a large costof one-off financial rescue measures. The large consolidation packages adopted since mid-2008, amounting to some 9% of GDP in2009-10, have barelyhalted the deterioration of the underlying general governmentbalance.Thedeficit ratio reached14.4% of GDP in2009 and is estimated at 32.3% in 2010.

In 2010, capital injections intoAnglo Irish Bank and two smaller building societies in the form ofpromissory notes account foralmost 20% of GDP.While the full amount ofpromissory notes isincluded in the government deficit and debt in2010, the actual borrowing needs related to the notes are spread over a period of 10 years. The four-year plan published in late Novemberincludes detailed measures for 2011 and broad measures for 2012-14. The budget that will besubmitted to parliament on 7 December will include a consolidation package of almost EUR 6billion (3.7% ofGDP). Based on this, the deficit is expected tonarrow tosome 10¼% of GDP nextyear which issomewhat higher than that projected by the national authorities due to the assumption of less favourable nominal GDP growth. Consistentwith the preliminary viewof Eurostat on the matter,(73) this figure reflects zero interest paid onthe promissory notes issued to banks in 2011-12 torestore their capital positions. Three-quarters of the measures for 2011 areon the expenditure side,including cuts in capital expenditure (1.1% of GDP), savings on purchases (0.6%), lower socialtransfers (0.5%) and a reduction in public sector employment (0.2%). A reform of personal incometax system is initiated accounting for most of the measures on the revenue side (0.8% of GDP). The disposal of non-financial assets is estimated tohave a one-off deficit-reducing effect of 0.3% ofGDP in 2011. (72)One-off measures for 2009 include a deficit-increasing capital injection into Anglo Irish Bank (2.5% of GDP) and a deficit-reducing transfer ofpension fund assets to the general government (0.6%).(73) See: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/methodology/advice_member_states85 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Table II.7.1:Main featuresof country forecast - IRELAND2009Annual percentagechangebn EURCurr. prices% GDP92-05200720082009201020112012 GDP 159.6100.06.85.6-3.5-7.6-0.20.91.9 Private consumption81.050.75.66.3-1.8-7.2-1.4-1.8-1.0 Publicconsumption31.419.74.87.32.8-4.1-2.2-5.7-0.8Gross fixed capital formation24.715.58.32.8-14.3-31.1-21.1-10.00.0 of which :  equipment6.84.38.117.2-17.4-22.5-7.0-3.23.8 Exports (goodsand services)144.890.711.78.2-0.8-4.15.74.54.5 Imports (goods and services)120.475.411.17.8-2.9-9.72.30.92.5GNI (GDP deflator)132.683.16.44.4-3.5-11.4-2.7-0.30.3Contribution to GDP growth :Domestic demand5.34.9-3.9-11.3-4.4-3.2-0.6Inventories0.00.0-0.7-1.40.70.40.0Net exports1.71.11.53.83.43.72.6 Employment3.83.7-1.1-8.2-4.0-0.80.6 Unemployment rate(a)8.24.66.311.913.713.512.7Compensation of employees/head5.35.43.40.0-1.90.50.1 Unitlabourcosts whole economy2.33.45.9-0.6-5.6-1.3-1.2Real unit labour costs-1.42.37.53.6-3.9-1.6-1.9Savingsrate of households (b)--9.316.316.315.815.1 GDP deflator3.71.1-1.5-4.0-1.70.40.8 Harmonised index of consumer prices-2.93.1-1.7-1.50.40.6Terms of trade of goods-0.3-2.0-5.94.9-0.10.00.0 Trade balance(c)20.410.513.220.322.925.126.7 Current-account balance (c)0.6-5.5-5.6-3.1-1.11.52.7 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-)vis-à-vis ROW(c)1.0-5.6-5.9-3.4-1.11.42.6General government balance (c)0.60.0-7.3-14.4-32.3-10.3-9.1Cyclically-adjusted budget balance(c)0.3-1.7-7.3-11.8-30.2-9.1-8.9Structural budget balance (c)--1.7-7.3-9.8-11.1-9.3-8.9General government gross debt (c)54.325.044.365.597.4107.0114.3(a)Eurostat definition(b) gross saving divided bygross disposable income (c) as a percentageofGDP86 In2012, the deficit ratio is projected todecrease to9.1% of GDP taking into account broadconsolidation measures of2.2% of GDP.

A sharp increase in the gross-debt-to-GDP ratio from 65%in 2009 to97% in2010reflects the large primarydeficit, including bank rescue measures, risinginterest expenditure andfalling nominal GDP. Inparticular,promissory notes contribute almost 20 pps. to the increase in the debt ratio in 2010. However, the government deficit and debt issubject to further risks related tobanking sectorrecapitalisation needs. Gross debt is projected to rise to 114% ofGDP by 2012. 8. GREECE Rebalancing growth amidst ongoing fiscal consolidation 87 Economic adjustment is supported byrestrictive fiscal policy A decade of expansionary fiscal policies resulted in the build-up of unsustainably high fiscal (highgeneral government deficitand gross debt stock, rising interest payments) and macroeconomic (high current-account deficit and external debt, outflow of income) imbalances.  Following the escalation of the debt crisis inspring2010 and the setting-up of the three-year Economic Adjustment Programme, Greeceadopted comprehensive fiscal consolidation measures. They are expected to have a dampening impact on domestic demand in2010 and the firsthalfof 2011. However, successful and crediblefiscal adjustment efforts should boost confidenceand improve sentiment. Credibility gains are expected to compensate for the economic cost ofadjustment and lead to thebeginning of a recoveryin the second halfof 2011. Sustained fiscal consolidationwould support the muchneededrebalancing of the economy towards a higherpositive contribution to growth of the externalsector. Recession deepens as the downward 
adjustment in domestic demand accelerates–  The recent downward revision of annual real GDPdata for 2009(almost -2½% compared with-2%previously) will have an adverse impact on realGDP dynamics in 2010. Moreover, the sharp dropin domesticdemand (investment and private consumption in particular) inthe first nine months of 2010 points to a significant contraction in economic activity. Despite the recovery in the thirdquarter, negative average exports growthso faralso weighs on this year's economic performance.  Marketpressures and high spreads have beenkeeping up the cost of and limiting private sectoraccess to financing. Credit expansion has been decelerating on the back of tighter credit conditions and highhousehold indebtedness. High-frequency and leading indicators suggest that the economy will lose further steam in the currentyear, before the recovery kicks induring thesecondhalf of 2011. For the year as awhole, economic activity is set to contract by -4¼% in2010. In the short term, fiscal tightening will have a strong contraction impact on economic activity,on the back of cuts in public wages, an increasing tax burden and ensuing declining disposableincome andpublic spending. Real GDP is expected to further decline by 3% in2011 Œ mainly due to carry-over effects Œ whilegrowth is expected to turn around positively during the second half of the year, with the recovery gaining further momentum in 2012. Thecontraction of economic activity, reflected in weakening labour demand from the retail, wholesale and construction sectors, is weighing heavily on employment which is set to fall bymore than 5% over the forecast horizon. Reducedemployment opportunities in the private sector, along with the recruitment freeze and cuts in short-term contracts in the public sector will pushthe unemployment rate up to just below 15% in2012. Negative employment growth and declining wages should weigh on disposable income over themedium-term, dampening realdemand. Thehouseholds savingrate wouldturn positive already in 2010. As a result, private consumption isprojected to contract by around4% in2010 andfurther 4¼% in 2011, before returning toa moderately positive growth rate at the end of the forecast horizon.

Tightercredit conditions and subdued domestic demandEuropean Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
should lead to a further strong decline in 2010, 
before a gradual q-o-q improvement takes course 

in the second half of 2011.  
–while the recovery is entirely driven by the 
external sector The contraction in domestic demand will be 
sustained over the forecast horizon, mirrored also 

by shrinking imports. Total exports, which started 

to recover already in 2010, will be further 

enhanced in 2011-12 by labour cost developments 

and favourable external de
mand factors. Exports of 
goods should rise by around 5½% in 2011 and 
increase further in 2012, wh
ile exports of services 
Œ in particular world trade sensitive merchant 

shipping and tourist recei
pts Œ should recover at 
a similar pace. All in all, the contribution of net 

exports to GDP growth should be highly positive 
in 2010-12, due to both th
e accelerating pick-up in 
exports and the ongoing contraction in imports.  
The risks to this baseline scenario are broadly 
balanced. On the positive side, the resurgence of 
both consumer and business confidence and the 
gradual improvement of liquidity and 
capitalisation of Greek banks may help to sustain 
credit expansion at modest levels, which could 

underpin private consumption and foster 

investment. In addition, the contribution of net 

exports to GDP growth may turn out to be stronger 

than projected, should th
e impact of ongoing and 
planned structural refo
rms materialise more 
swiftly. On the negative side, the contraction in 

imports may prove to be more transitory and less 
pronounced than expected (especially towards the 
end of the forecast hori
zon). If tighter credit 
conditions persist, external financing to the private 
sector could prove less buoyant and so the 
servicing of Greece's high external debt might 
crowd out domestic spending.  
Despite high (tax-driven) inflation– Inflationary pressures have built up in the course 

of 2010, fuelled by the VAT-rates rises in March 

and July and the increas
e in excise duties on 
alcohol, tobacco and fuel. Based on price 

developments in the first ten months of the year, 

annual inflation in 2010 should exceed 4½% on 
average. The large impact of taxes on inflation, in 
the context of a severe recession, calls for strong 
and frontloaded structural reforms targeting the 
existing inflexibilities in domestic markets. 
Looking forward, both headline and core inflation 
should decline, as base effects and tax effects fade 
out, and slack in the economy and wage 

moderation start feeding through. 
–external imbalances are decreasing at a fast 
pace and competitiveness is starting to 
recover  Higher-than-expected tax-driven inflation has not 
produced any evidence so far of an adverse 

wage-price spiral that could push labour costs 

higher. In fact, the competitiveness losses 

accumulated in recent years will start to be 

reversed over the forecast 
horizon, mainly due to 
a faster-than-expected la
bour market adjustment. 
This will spur labour reallocation and hasten real 
wage adjustment. The wage cuts in the public 
sector, their expected spill-over effect in the 
private sector and the moderate recent private 
sector minimum wage agreements (the minimum 
wage will be frozen in 2010 and will increase by 
1.5% in July 2011 and 1.7% in July 2012) are 

expected to push unit 
labour cost down, after 
a long period of rapid growth. Private sector 

average wages are projected to respond 

accordingly to the strong downturn and the fall in 
employment, thus contributing to partial recovery 
of the competitiveness losses. 
Developments in the external sector have already 
kick-started a partial correction of the external 

deficit in 2010. Further improvement over the 

medium term is expected, driven by accelerating 

exports growth and falling imports. The 

current-account deficit is expected to decline to 

8% of GDP in 2011 and to move closer to 6% of 
GDP in 2012, down from 10½% of GDP in 2010. 
Expected competitiveness gains and the benefits 
from ongoing structural reforms may result in an 
even faster adjustment
 of the current-account 
balance. 
Ongoing fiscal consolidation to be further 
strengthened in 2011 The 2009 general government deficit notified by 
the Greek authorities in November 2010 stands at 

15½% of GDP, 1¾ pps. higher than the previous 

notification made in April 2010. Eurostat has lifted 

the reservations on Greek deficit and debt figures 

expressed in October 2009 and April 2010
(74) and (74) Eurostat (News Release 149/2009) has expressed 
a reservation on the data re

The major elements of the revisionconcerned the sector reclassification of public enterprises and their inclusion ingeneralgovernment, the significantly worse-than-expected fiscal position of the social security sectorand the accounting of off-market swaps. At the same time,generalgovernment grossdebt in 2009wasrevised upward by 11¾% of GDP, reaching almost 127%of GDP.For 2010, the official general governmentdeficitestimate stands at around9½% of GDP (EUR22.3bn), 1½% of GDP above the original target of8% of GDP (EUR 18.5 bn).About one third of the shortfall is explained by propagation effects of Eurostat revisions of the 2009 fiscal statistics. The remaining two-thirds would be explained byrevenue underperformance of some 1¾% of GDP (EUR 4 bn) comparedwith the initial revenue target. At the same time, additional sizeablereservation was expressed on 22 April 2010 (News Release 55/2010).(75)Eurostat has lifted the reservation on Greek data (NewsRelease 170/2010 of 15 November 2010). Eurostat and the Hellenic Statistical Authority have addressed all of the issues identified in the last reservation during a series of EDP methodological visits.spending retrenchment has been undertaken ascompared to the May programme targets.(76)The 2011budget (as submitted to Parliament on18November) foresees additional measures amounting to2½% of GDP, which should be sufficient toreach the 2011 deficit target of 7½% ofGDP. This would bring total fiscal consolidationmeasures in 2011 Œ including those agreed in May Œ to 5¾% of GDP. About two-thirds of the agreed new measures are on the expenditure side, and most of them are structural in nature.They include cuts in unproductive and untargeted spending,a reduction in short term contracts in the public sector, better targeting of universal household subsidies, and better management and use of state assets, particularly in the collectionof arrears.  Taking into account the consolidation measures for 2012 agreed under the Economic Adjustment Programme in May (but no additional ones) and onthe back of the discontinuation of one-offmeasures tobe implementedin 2011, the headline deficit should exceed 7½% of GDP in 2012. Debt would increase from 126¾% of GDP in2009 to156%of GDP in2012. (76)Subject to a positive compliance assessment by the Council, the third loan disbursement under the Economic Adjustment Programme is planned for December (IMF) and mid-January (euro-area Member States).9. SPAIN Prospects for a slow recovery while external imbalances recede 90 The economy is stabilising after the sharp adjustment in 2008-09  Robust growth between the mid-90s and 2007(above 3½% per year on average) was accompanied by growing imbalances: unsustainable private sector indebtedness, excessive expansion of residential investment, large andpersistent cost competitiveness lossesand wide external deficits. The financial crisis struck the Spanish economy at a time when a gradual adjustment of these imbalances appearedto have started. The correction became sharp,leading to a severe economic contraction between the second quarterof2008and the end of2009. GDP fell by a cumulative 4.7% over thisperiod and only stoppedfalling at the beginningof2010.  The counterpart to the endof the credit boom wassudden shifts in sectoral balance sheets. Thehousehold saving rate increased sharply and thesector moved from being a net borrower until mid2008 to being a large net lender in the secondquarter of 2010. The net borrowing position of thecorporate sector also shrank very rapidly.Conversely, the impact of the crisis and thediscretionary stimulus turned the pre-crisisgovernment surpluses into a large net borrowingposition. The external deficit halved to less than 5% in the secondquarterof 2010 from the 2007 peak, due mainly to a sharp import retrenchment.  Overall, the economy appears to have stabilised in 2010 Œ withstill shrinking constructionactivity compensated for by the contribution of other sectors Œ but it has not yet embarked on a robustrecoverypath. For the year as a whole, GDP isprojected to fall by ¼%, following a contraction of 3.7% in2009. Private consumption was buoyant inthe first two quarters of 2010, partially drivenbyfront-loading of consumption in anticipation of the VAT-rate increase on 1 July. Construction investment is projected to continue to contract ata rapid pace, reflecting the ongoing adjustment in housing investment. However, equipment investment is set to recover due tofavourable developments in private consumption and exportsin the first half of this year.  As a result, domestic demand shoulddragGDP growth downby 1¼ pps. this year, compared to a negative contribution of almost 6½ pps. last year. A better-than-expected external demand situationis underpinning a vigorous recovery in exports. However, higher imports,driven by the significantincrease indomestic demand in the first half of2010 and higher oil prices, are expected to lead to a fall in the contribution of net external demand to GDP to 1 pp., from 2.7 pps. in 2009. Further adjustment needs and policy action setthe scene for the future The need for further adjustmentand deleveragingwill shape the economy over the comingyears. Household and corporate debthas broadly stabilised since the beginning of 2008, albeit at high levels. Low interest rates are facilitatingdebtservicing. Netexternal debt also remains high, butit has been refinanced smoothly. While financial asset prices have recovered, thus supporting private sector wealth, house prices are stilldeclining, although at a slower pace and with much regionaldifferentiation.With the adjustment in the labour market takingplace principally on the employment side, productivity accelerated during the crisis (in contrast to other countries), sustaining profitabilityonce the wage adjustment followed belatedly. Wage growth has moderated significantly in the first semester of2010.  Graph II.9.1:Spain -GDPgrowth andcontributions-8-6-4-20246
806Q107Q108Q109Q110Q111Q112Q1pps.Domestic demand, incl. inventoriesNet exportsGDP (y-o-y%)forecastSpain has experienced a period of market tensions in the context of increasingfinancial marketfragilities. In response, the government has accelerated and expanded its fiscal consolidation and structural reform agendas. In May 2010, Spainadopted a consolidation package, which Member States, Spain frontloaded the fiscal consolidationefforts foreseen in the February 2010 update of the Stability Programme. In June2010, it implementeda labour market reform aimed at reducing theduality of the labour market and increasingflexibility for firms. The wide-ranging restructuring process in the savings banks sector,supported by the Fund for Orderly BankRestructuring ('FROB'), was stepped up and a newgovernance regimefor savings bankswas introduced. Other important reform items are being discussed in parliament or are under preparation Œsuch as reforms ofpensions,collective bargaining, product markets and innovation. Once fullyimplemented, the combined effects of thesereforms should lift potential growth andemployment and facilitate the reallocation of the excess resources that poured into the construction sector during the boom years.  The fiscal consolidation package and the results of the comprehensive stress testof banks in July 2010helped to decouple Spain from the group ofeuro-area Member States consideredmost vulnerable by financial markets. However, government bond spreadsagainst the Germanbenchmark widened again in mid-October/earlyNovember in the wake of increasing market tensions.  A slow recovery in 2011-12 will support limitedjob creation Looking forward, the continuingdeleveraging process, very high unemployment and the short-term demand impact of fiscal consolidation are all expected to lead to more muted GDP growth than in some other euro-area countries. GDP is forecast to grow by¾% in 2011 and by1¾% in 2012.  The contribution of domestic demand togrowth isprojected to remain slightly negative in2011, before turningpositive in 2012. Specifically,private consumption is setto grow modestly in2011, and to accelerate moderately in 2012 asdisposable income picks up and the repair ofhousehold balance sheets will have advanced further. The projected evolution of consumption takes into account the impactof the fiscal austerity measures in 2011on disposable income and the fact that both demand for, and access to, credit areexpected to remainmore restrained than in the past. The household savings ratio is expected tocontinue to fall gradually over the forecast horizon from the peak of 18.1% reached in the last quarterof 2009, but toremain above pre-crisis levels.  Gross fixed capital formation is expected to continue todecline in 2011, due to the ongoing reduction of capacity in the construction sector and significant cuts in public investment, which areonlypartially offsetby a mild recovery inequipment investment amidst improving economicprospects. Although the stock of unsold dwellings is expected to remain large in some regions, production capacity in housing construction at the national level is forecast to stabilise by 2012. In addition,non-residential construction is expected to recover on the back of improving economicprospects, thus partly offsetting the projected fallin infrastructure investment. All in all, construction investment should grow moderately in 2012. Thiswould allow the rate of growth of total gross capital formation to turnpositive in2012.  Net exports are projected tocontinue contributing positively to growth over the forecast period, in particular in 2011. Against a backdrop of negative domestic demand growth, imports are expected toexpand only slowly in2011, beforerebounding in 2012. As the downsizing of domesticdemand during the crisis is likely to be partly structural andlasting, the share of imports in GDP is expected to remain lower than in the years preceding the crisis. Growth of exports is projected to continue tooutpace that of imports, with Spanish exportersexpected to maintain their market shares. However, the softening of world demand growthand the limited correctionofpast cost-competitiveness losses is expected to reduce the dynamism of exports relative to 2010.

moderately in 2012. The unemployment rate is set 
to rise further, to 20% of the labour force in 2011, 

before falling to around 19% in 2012. The full 

implementation of the recent labour-market reform 

is expected to reduce the 
degree of labour market 
segmentation and to contribute to reducing 
structural unemployment over time. 
A further narrowing of the current-account 
deficit is expected to lead to a levelling off of 
net external debt  The long period of large external deficits has 
added to net external liabilities, which surpassed 

90% of GDP in 2009. The servicing of these 

liabilities will continue to absorb a non-negligible 

share of income. The pr
imary income deficit, 
including net current transfers, is expected to 
continue to increase and to reach 3% by 2012. 
Overall, the current-account 
deficit is set to narrow 
to 4¾% of GDP in 2010 and to 3¾% in 2011-12, 

supporting a levelling-off 
of net external debt
. Unit labour costs set to decrease further in 2011 
and inflation to remain moderate  The crisis has shown that inadequate wage 
bargaining mechanisms, including indexation 

clauses, prevent nominal wages from adjusting in 

a timely manner, even 
when job losses and 
unemployment rise sharply. The relaxation of 

employment protection legislation for permanent 
contracts and the possibility to opt out of collective 
bargaining agreements, introduced with the recent 
reform of the labour mark
ets, could however exert 
a constraining effect on wage growth in the future. 
The pace of growth of real compensation per 
employee is projected to fall to 1¾% in 2010, after 
recording 3¾% growth in 2009 in the midst of the 
crisis, but it is expected to increase again by 2012.  
Productivity growth in Spain has been sluggish 
during the last decade (½% on average in the 
period 1998-2008), partly as a result of the 
allocation of a large amount of resources to 
investment in the construction sector and to some 
low-productivity services. The recent apparent 
surge in productivity growth is mainly due to the 

sharp contraction in these activities rather than to 

improvements in the structural drivers of total 

factor productivity. By 
the end of the forecast 
period, productivity is expected to fall back to 

a growth rate of around ½%, pointing to the need 

for efforts to enhance innovation and investment 
by firms, strengthen human capital and foster 
competition. Due to these diverging patterns of 

wage and productivity developments, unit labour 
costs are projected to dec
line only marginally in 
2011 and to return to positive growth in 2012.  
After the slightly negative rate recorded in 2009, 
inflation is projected to exceed 1½% on average in 
2010, mainly driven by a temporary surge in 
energy prices and increas
es in indirect taxes. 
Notwithstanding the uncertainty related to the 
prices of oil and other commodities in international 

markets, headline inflation is forecast to remain 

close to 1½% over the forecast horizon on the back 

of gradually rising core inflation.  
Significant but balanced risks to the baseline scenario  Private consumption could receive an extra 
impulse if the household saving rate, which is still 

at historically high levels, fall faster than expected 

as a result of low interest rates. The effective 

implementation of the recently adopted structural 

reforms could spur economic dynamism and 
bolster confidence. The swift adoption of other 
reforms under preparation could pave the way for 
a better performance of the economy by reducing 
the transmission of inflation shocks to wages and 
by producing a better alignment between wages 
and productivity. On the other hand, the still-
subdued employment prospects and high 
unemployment rate might erode confidence and 

lead households to hold back on expenditure. 

Further substantial and protracted falls in house 

prices could lead to a deeper-than-expected 

adjustment in construction, dent household wealth 
and sap consumer confidence. With net exports 
providing a major contribution to short-term 
growth, worse-than-expected growth in external 
demand would weigh heavily on economic 

activity. Finally, downside risks stemming from 

a reappearance of stress in financial markets 
remain present.  
Safeguarding the long-term sustainability of 
public finances The departure from the highly tax-rich growth 
composition of the boom and increased social 

protection needs stemming from the crisis resulted 

in a sharp deterioration 
in the public accounts in 2008-09. 
The frontloading of fiscal consolidation is 
expected to start to deliver a significant correction 
92 Member States, Spain this year. In2010, total revenues are estimated toincrease by  1¾ pps. of GDP. This  figure  includes GDP, mostly due to cuts inpublic investment and government public consumption. The deficit isprojected at 9¼% of GDP in 2010, down from11.1% of GDPin 2009.

The government has committed itself tothe implementation of additional measures if deviations from the expected budgetary execution are observed. The 2011 budget tightens the procedures to enforce the respect of targets by sub-national entities. Based on the customaryunchanged-policy assumption, the 2012budgetdeficitis forecastto be 5½% ofGDP.

FRANCE Consolidation to start in earnest 94 Domestic demand picked up in thesecondand third quarters of 2010 The French economy came out of the recession in the second quarter of 2009 thanks both toa rebound inexports and to improved domestic consumption as the recovery plan got underway. The plan, which amounted toaround 1¼% of GDPfor 2009-10, supported purchasing powerandhouseholds' consumption.Somemeasures hada very high multiplier: the car scrappingpremium sustained private consumption significantly, also on the backof one-off social transfers, which supported households' disposable income. All inall, both private consumption anddisposableincome growth remained positive throughout 2009and the first three quarters of 2010. Cash-flow support tobusinesses probably kept numerouscompanies afloat and limited the impact of thedownturn on the French production system.Nevertheless, investment was subject to a strongcorrection which only stopped in the secondquarter of 2010 after 8 consecutive quarters in negative territory. On the latest developments, activity accelerated in the second quarter of 2010, when GDP increasedby 0.7% q-o-q, the best performance since early2007. It slowed in the third quarter, growing by0.4%. Economic expansion was exclusively drivenby domesticdemand, as in the second quarter.Destocking began tofade, after large negativecontributionsof stocks togrowth in the previoussix quarters. Total investment edged up in the second quarter and continued to support activity, thanks to a rebound in business investment and a stabilisation ofinvestmentin housing. Private consumptionwas also on the rise in line with disposable incomethanks to improvements in the labour market, deceleration in taxes and moremoderate prices. At the same time, net trade was a drag on growth, withimportsoutpacingexportsin both the second and the third quarter.  Inthe final quarter of2010, GDP issetto grow by0.4%, implying an annual growth rateof 1.6% for the year. The composite index for business climatein France, which is based on survey data fromindustry, services, construction and retail trade is above its long-term average and suggestsa continued pace of expansion for the comingquarters. In particular in the industry and servicessectors, business climate indicators improved again in October and are now above their long-term average.

This situation is not comparable withthe 1995 benchmark, inwhich with 22days of strike without ﬁservice minimumﬂhad a 0.2 pp. impact on quarterly GDP.Modest recovery in exports French exports benefited from the pick-up in worlddemandand posted positive growthrates fromthethird quarter of 2009, strengthening in 2010 withquarterly growth of 4.4%, 2.6% and 2.5% inthefirst three quarters. This recovery was led by Asian markets and investment in intermediary goods. Inaddition, French exports benefited from the verygood showofGermany in the secondquarter.  Limited economic expansion in 2011; recovery to gain strength in 2012  Economic expansion is again expected torely onbothprivate consumption and investment in 2011. Past experience with deep financial crises hasshown that there will be no major acceleration ofgrowth so soon after the trough:domestic demandwill not be dynamic enough to strongly support economic expansion. Private consumption growth is expected to remainpositive in 2011but should not come back to Member States, France 
pre-crisis rates of expansion: rather, it is set to 
remain subdued in line with the evolution of 

disposable income growing by around 1½% as 

compared to 2½% in the past. In more detail, the 

temporary measures that supported income in 

2009/10 will be phased out. In particular, the 
car-scrapping scheme is e
xpected to expire by the 
end of 2010. Consolidatio
n measures included in 
the draft budget law will also have an adverse 

effect on purchasing power. Tax increases on 
households will have a 0.3 pp. impact on revenue 
growth (mainly through reductions in tax 
expenditure). The slowdown of compensation of 
public employees, through a reduction in 

employment and a limited increase in salaries, will 

also contribute to the weakness of households' 

disposable income, especially given the size of 

public employment in France.  
Total investment is not expected to pick up 
strongly and sustain growth in a significant way. 

After being hit hard during the crisis, corporate 

investment has gradually increased and eventually 

returned to positive growth rates in mid 2010. 

However, the combination of a slowdown in world 

trade and weak domestic demand brings about 

rather limited production expectations. 

Concomitantly, the latest available information 
shows that the production capacity utilisation rate 
is still well below its long term average. 
Productive investment is therefore projected to be 
limited and should mainly concentrate on 
replacement investment. It is also worth 
highlighting that from the supply side, investment 

prospects are equally subdued. The need for firms 

to strengthen their balan
ce sheets in a context of high indebtedness and low 
self-financing capacity 
suggests little room for a surge in productive 
investment. In addition, while financing conditions 
are less tight, they are not yet favourable. In 
particular, interest rates have fallen but spreads on 
corporate bonds have increased and credit 
conditions remain stricter than before the crisis. 
Finally, fiscal policy will not be as supportive as it 

was during the crisis with most of the 

consolidation measures targeted to enterprises.  
As regards investment in construction, the sector 
has stabilised after putting a heavy and continuous 

drag on growth for the last two years. The upturn 
in permits and construction starts together with the 
slight contraction of stocks of unsold homes seem 
to indicate a gradual recovery of housing 
investment. In addition, public investment will 
stabilise after declining in 2010. All in all, growth 
in construction investment is expected to be 
positive as of 2011. 
Concerning developments of the external sector in 
2011, the growth of international demand for 
French products might almost halve if the 

projected slowdown of import appetite in the 

French trading partners finally materialises. 
In general, unlike in the past, domestic demand 
will not be strong enough to dynamically support 
economic activity and consolidation measures will 
somewhat limit the expansion. GDP growth is thus 

expected to grow moderately in 2011 by 1.6%. In 

2012, quarterly GDP growth is projected to be 

slightly above potential as the large output gap 

closes gradually. Economic activity is expected to 
expand by close to 2% on average, supported by 
domestic demand.  
Several uncertainties surround this scenario. In 
particular, inventory levels are judged to be lower 
than their long-term average and businesses could 
run down stocks less extensively or even restock, 
which would be more favourable to growth. On the 

other hand, GDP growth could be hindered by 

further market share losses. 
World demand: start me up? While France's relativel
y low degree of trade openness has helped it to weather the storm, 

because of the lack of st
ructural adjustment means 
that the French economy has not fully benefited 

from the pick-up of worl
d trade. The combination 
of a rather sustained domestic demand, feeding in 
turn relatively dynamic imports, and continuously 
declining market shares, leads to increasing 
external imbalances and 
a sluggish recovery. In 
2010, while world trade was booming, net trade 

was only a small contributor to growth. The 
geographic specialisation of France's exports could 
explain part of this performance, as 70% of its 
exports go to European economies, which grew 

and are expected to grow at a much slower pace 

than emerging econo
mies and Asia.  
Net trade has hampered
 French growth in 
a significant way over the last few years. This can 
be explained on the basis of a series of weaknesses 
on the supply side. A decomposition of French 

exports clearly points to the medium-high 

technology positioning of French products, which, 

together with relatively low investment in R&D 

and underperformances as
 regards the education 
95 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 system, is placing the country in a situation of innovationfollower. Against this background,French exporters have reduced their profit marginsin order to contain the loss in terms of price competitiveness. However, compressed profitmargins havebeen insufficient to limit the rapidloss of market shares, given the pressure on prices from competitors in emerging economies. Inaddition, France's net exports are held back by the size and the number of exporting firms. For a largemajority of firms, exportsrepresent a verylimitedshare of their turnover, compared with German companies for example.  Increasing labour utilisation Œ key for a sustainable recovery With the strong deterioration in economic activity,the French labour marketadjusted sharply. Sincethe first quarter of 2010, employment has started torise again gradually. Mirroring whathappened during the crisis, job creations have been so farlimited to temporary employment ("interim"). Job creation is set to continue throughout the forecasthorizon but at a slow pace (0.5% and 0.7%respectively in 2011 and2012). Indeed, growthprospects are not good enough to trigger a significant improvement in the labour market. Inaddition,subsidized contracts would nolonger support public employment as observed during the crisis. The unemployment rate is likely to decrease slowly until the end of 2012, not yet reaching its pre-crisis level. The employment rate will remain low at around 65% in 2012. This could add to the historicallyinsufficient utilisation of labour, which is one of the main bottlenecks of the French economy. Poorlabour-market functioningin France manifests itself in a rather low participation rate at both endsof the age spectrum (young and older workers), a highunemployment rate, and a low number ofaverage hoursworked. During the crisis, the unemployment rate of the younghas jumped froman already high level compared to Europeanstandards (24.4% in 2009 from 19.4% in 2007, vs.15.4% in theEU as a whole). This may be linked to insufficient wagedifferentiation at the lower end of the wage scale as a result of the minimum wage. Additionally, it seems that many employers are currently actively encouraging early retirement.Furthermore, tax cutsonovertime hours couldincite employers to favour overtime over new recruitment and thus limit job creation. On theother hand, the pension reform is expected to havea gradual but positive impact on the total labourforce and employment in the coming years. Deficit decline but level still high In 2010, the budget deficit is projected to almoststabilise compared to2009 at around7¾% of GDP. The balance of discretionary measures in2010 is broadly neutral: the positive impact of thephasing-outof the recovery plan (some ¾% ofGDP) is projected to offsetthe new discretionarymeasures adopted in the 2010 budget, among which the reform of the local business tax(loweringrevenues by around ½% of GDP) and the decrease of VAT in the catering sector (around 0.1% of GDP).Graph II.10.2:France - Publicfinances01234567891000010203040506070809101112% of GDP505560657075

The measures consist mainly of tax increases andwould lead toa rise inthe tax burden byaround¾% of GDP. Onthe expenditure side, the phasing out of theremaining measures taken in the context of therecovery plan, together with a freeze in valueterms of spending at the central government level (excluding pensions for civil servants and interestpayments) and the reform of the pension system, would improve the deficit by around ½% of GDP. Those measures would more thanoffset the budgetary impact of the public loan (the so-called "Investissements d'avenir", notably consisting inpublic investment), which would deteriorate the 2011 budget deficit byaround 0.1% of GDP (and publicdebt by around¼% of GDP).96 Member States, France Table II.10.1:Main featuresof country forecast - FRANCE2009Annual percentagechangebn EURCurr. prices% GDP92-05200720082009201020112012 GDP 1907.1100.02.02.40.2-2.61.61.61.8 Private consumption1112.858.32.12.60.50.61.51.41.7 Publicconsumption469.824.61.51.51.72.71.50.40.4Gross fixed capital formation392.120.62.26.00.5-7.1-1.72.43.5 of which :  equipment99.35.23.19.13.5-9.62.83.14.5 Exports (goodsand services)439.623.05.22.5-0.5-12.49.55.96.2 Imports (goods and services)476.625.05.35.60.6-10.78.25.75.7GNI (GDP deflator)1922.8100.82.02.60.1-2.81.71.71.8Contribution to GDP growth :Domestic demand1.93.10.8-0.60.91.41.8Inventories0.00.2-0.3-1.90.60.30.0Net exports0.0-0.9-0.3-0.20.1-0.10.0 Employment0.61.60.7-1.20.00.50.7 Unemployment rate(a)10.08.47.89.59.69.59.2Compensation of employees/f.t.e.2.72.32.41.62.01.71.8 Unitlabourcosts whole economy1.31.52.93.00.30.50.7Real unit labour costs-0.3-1.00.32.5-0.1-1.1-0.8Savingsrate of households (b)--15.116.015.915.715.7 GDP deflator1.62.52.60.50.51.61.5 Harmonised index of consumer prices1.81.63.20.11.71.61.6Terms of trade of goods0.01.5-1.22.3-3.50.5-0.2 Trade balance(c)0.4-2.1-2.8-2.2-3.0-3.0-3.0 Current-account balance (c)0.6-2.2-2.7-2.9-3.3-3.4-3.5 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-)vis-à-vis ROW(c)0.6-2.1-2.7-2.8-3.8-3.1-3.0General government balance (c)-3.4-2.7-3.3-7.5-7.7-6.3-5.8Cyclically-adjusted budget balance(c)-3.7-3.7-3.5-5.8-6.0-4.6-4.4Structural budget balance (c)--3.8-3.6-5.8-5.8-4.6-4.4General government gross debt (c)57.163.867.578.183.086.889.8(a)Eurostat definition(b) gross saving divided bygross disposable income (c) as a percentageofGDP97 The general government deficit would continue itsdecreasing trend in 2012. Social benefits would be held in line with the economic recovery and somediscretionarymeasures would contribute toimproving the deficit; these include the reform ofthe pension system and some tax increasespresented inthe Draft Budget for 2011 witha budgetary impact in 2012. The impact of thepublic loanwould be the same as in2011. Thisdeficit projectionwould still be significantly above the government™s target of 4.6% included in the pluriannual budget. Indeed, the improvementofthe 2012deficit projectedby the French authorities is foreseen to bebackedby additional measures that still need to be further specified and could therefore not be taken into account in the Commission'services forecast. In addition, the economic environment in 2012 anticipated by the French authorities would bemore conducive toimproving the situationof public finances.  The debt-to-GDP ratio would continuously riseover the forecast horizon due to the high expecteddeficits; it would reach almost 90% of GDP in2012.  The  increase  indebt-service requirements,  already the secondbudgetary spending at thecentral government level, right after public spending on education, could crowd outmore productive expenditure necessary to furtherstimulate growth. This underlines the need for fiscal consolidation.  The consolidation strategy announcedby theFrench authorities is backed by some structural reforms, targeting long-term sustainability and the overall budgetary framework. The reformof thepension system would balance pension accounts in2018. In particular, it includes a gradual lift of the minimum retirement age fromthe current 60 to 62, as well as an increase in the age at which a full pension can be received (fromthe current 65 to 67). As regards the budgetary framework, theFrench authorities havenotably announced measures aiming atbetter monitoring and reaching the objective set for healthcare spending. A constitutional reform aimed at compelling each newly appointed government to setout a five-yearconsolidationpath and to commit to a deadline for reaching a balanced budget in structural terms, wasalso announced.11. ITALY Back to moderate growth 98 An export-led recovery in 2010 Over the forecast horizon, the Italian economy is 
expected to return to the moderate growth rates 

experienced before the crisis. The structural 

weaknesses behind the unsatisfactory productivity 

growth over the last decade are also set to weigh 

on the economy's ability to recover swiftly from 
the severe output loss recorded during the 
recession. After falling by more than 6% over 
2008-09, Italy's real GDP expanded by around ½% 
in quarterly terms in the first two quarters of 2010; 
according to preliminary 
estimates, GDP growth 
eased to ¼% in the third qua
rter and is projected to keep the same pace in the 
last quarter of the year. 
Overall, Italy's real GDP is forecast to grow by 

1.1% in 2010. 
The industrial sector, wh
ich drove the contraction 
in output from late 2008 to mid-2009, is leading 
the ongoing moderate recovery of the Italian 

economy, mainly thanks to the rebound in exports. 

Despite the deceleration in global demand 

anticipated for the second half of the year, export 

volumes are set to rise by almost 8% in 2010 as 

a whole, with exports of
 goods expected to be 
significantly more dynamic than those of services. 

Import volumes of goods are also projected to 
increase in 2010 due to
 the mild upturn in 
domestic demand, especially in investment in 

equipment, while imports of services are set to 
decline. As a result, net exports provide a positive 
contribution to GDP growth in 2010. 
The upturn in external demand in the first half of 
2010 supported investment in equipment, which 
also benefited from tax incentives. In the second 
half of the year, however, the anticipated less 
buoyant external environment and the expiry of the 

tax incentives at the end of June are set to dampen 
growth in machinery investment. Investment in 
construction is projected to remain subdued, due to 
the protracted weakness of
 the property market and 
the planned contraction in government capital 

spending.  
Private consumption stagnated in the first half of 
2010. Expenditure on durable goods, which had 
until the end of 2009 benefited from incentives to 
the purchase of energy-efficient goods, in 
particular vehicles, has been declining. The still 
fragile labour market situation is set to weigh on 
private consumption for the rest of the year, 

despite improved financial market conditions and 
a slight overall increase in real disposable income. 
Real GDP growth continues to be moderate in 
2011-12 In 2011, real GDP is foreca
st to grow at the same 
pace as in 2010, while in 
2012 it is expected to 
accelerate to 1.4%, around ½ pp. below the 
euro-area average. 
Exports are again expected 
to be the main growth 
driver in 2011-12. However the outlook for 
exports, given their geographical orientation, 

mainly depends on growth prospects in euro-area 

partners and thus prevents Italy from fully reaping 

the benefits of the more vigorous growth prospects 

in emerging markets. As imports are assumed to 

grow slightly less than exports in 2011-12, on the 
back of the still slow dynamics of domestic 
demand, net exports are projected to make 
a positive contribution to real GDP growth in both 
years.  The export channel is 
expected to support 
investment in equipment, which will also benefit 
from improved profitability conditions. However, 
capacity utilisation in industry, which plummeted 
at the worst of the crisis and is anticipated to 

continue recovering slow
ly throughout the forecast 
horizon, as well as the further need for 
balance-sheet adjustments, notably for small and 
medium-sized enterprises, may limit the scope for 
new investment plans. Investment in construction 
is projected to return to moderate positive growth 
in 2011-12. While investment in residential 
building is expected to pick up under the 

assumption of an improved housing market and 

better credit conditions, government infrastructure 
spending is bound to remain constrained by the 
planned consolidation of public finances. 
A slow recovery in labour market conditions and 
a moderate increase in real disposable income are 

expected to improve private consumption 

prospects only gradually in 2011-12.  
Risks to the outlook for the Italian economy appear 
broadly balanced. On the upside, global demand 
could prove stronger than anticipated, with further 
positive spillovers, first on investment and then 
Member States, Italy also on employment and private consumption. Onthe downside, possible renewed tensions and uncertainty in financial markets might affect economic agents' confidence. Real GDP growth prospects are set to be only marginally affected by the consolidation strategyplanned over the forecast horizon, as its directnegative impact on domestic demand is expectedto be partly offset bypositive confidence effects. The full implementation of the plannedconsolidationwill help to prevent a surge in Italy™s sovereign risk premium and its likely negative impact on the cost of capital for the entire economy. Current-account deficit narrows gradually Italy's losses in competitiveness over the decadebefore the crisis determined a steady worseningofthe current-account balance, which moved froma surplus to a deficit. An increase in the deficit inthe balance of primary income with the rest of the world, mainly due to the collapse in capitalrevenue inflows, further deteriorated thecurrent-account balance in2008-09. In2010, the merchandise trade balance is expected tomove froma small surplus to a moderate deficit because of worsened terms of trade, mainly related to the rebound in energy prices. By contrast, the services balance is set to reduce its deficit, thanks to falling imports. Notwithstanding the resulting overall deterioration in the external balance of goods and services, the current-account deficit isforecast to remain stable, thanks to a less negativebalance ofprimary incomes. In 2011-12, the external balance of goods and services is assumedto record a lower deficit, thanks to slightlymorefavourable terms of trade. As the balance of primary incomes is not anticipated tochangesignificantly, the current-account deficit is set todecline to 2½% of GDP by 2012. A short-lived rebound of productivity Throughout the crisis, firms chose tohoard labour, through a wider use ofthe wagesupplementation scheme (CIG), whereby employees stop workingor reduce hours workedbut keep their job atreduced pay.The effectof this scheme is visible when comparing full-time equivalent employment with headcount employment: according to national accounts figures,thenumber of full-timeequivalent employees declined by 2.7% in 2009,significantly more than the fall inheadcount employees (1.3%). In 2010, the requests to access the scheme continued to rise. However, thecomposition shifted fromordinary benefits to special ones supporting longer-term inactivityspells andworkers otherwise ineligible byreason of sector, firm size or type of employment contract.  As in2009 the contraction in real GDP was muchsharper than the fall in employment, the decline inlabour productivity alreadyunderway since 2008intensified. As the crisishas been affecting the labour market with some lag, further job losses are expected in2010. The gradual recovery inoutputis thus assumed to translate first into a reboundof productivity, then into an expansion of hoursworked, and only at a later stage in additionalheadcount employment, which is set to start risingmarginally in 2011 and accelerate in 2012. Productivity is then forecast to rise only mildly in 2011-12, in line with its pre-crisis trend.Reflecting the more moderate decline inheadcount employment and a shrinking labour supply inresponse to the depressed labour marketconditions, the unemployment rate increased only gradually over 2009, peaked at 8.5% between March and May 2010 and started declining duringthe summer. It is set to remain slightly above 8%across the forecast period on account of the stillmoderate recovery inheadcount employment.

The newly-reformed bargaining framework started tobe applied extensively in 2010. Contractual wages are thus set to increase in line with projected inflation excluding imported energygoods, while 99 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 the weak labour market conditions andproductivity developments are poised to leave littlescope for further increases at the level of firms or sectors. As a result, unit labour costs are expected to remain broadly constant in 2010 and increasemoderately in 2011-12, after the significant rises recordedover the last decade due to stagnating labour productivity and wage increases slightlyabove the euro-area average. The projectedunit labour cost dynamics over the forecast horizon would allow Italy to avoid further deterioration incompetitiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area.  After declining markedly in 2009, HICP inflation picked upin the firsthalf of2010, due tothe fadingout of favourable baseeffects fromenergyprices. In 2010 as a whole, it is projected torise to 1.6% on average, while coreinflation is forecast to remain considerably above the euro-area averagedue to a more sustained dynamics of service andnon-energygoods prices. Under the assumption of higher oilprices and moderately recoveringdomestic demand, HICP inflation is then expected to increase broadly in line with the euro-area average in 2011-12.  Fiscal consolidation leads to lower deficits in2011 and 2012 After closingat 5.3% in2009, thedeficit-to-GDPratiois projectedto decline to 3.5%by 2012. This forecast incorporatesboth the 2009-11 consolidationpackage adopted in summer 2008 and the 2011-13 consolidation package adopted inMay 2010, including the planned expenditure restraint at the lower government levels, but with a less optimistic ex ante assessment of the effectiveness of some of the measures to combat tax evasion.In 2010, the deficit is expected to fall slightly to5.0% of GDP. Revenues are set to growmoderately, broadly in line with nominal GDP. Indirect taxes are expected to pick up strongly,mainly thanks to the larger-than-anticipatedproceeds of a measure adopted in 2009 thatprohibits the offsettingof tax dues withunaudited tax credits above EUR 15000. Direct taxes are bound to follow the recovery at a slower pace, dueto the negative impact of falling interest rates in2009on withholding taxes onbankand postal saving interests. Capital taxrevenues are projectedto decline substantially this year, on the backof the expiry ofone-off measures that boosted 2009 revenues by¾ pp. ofGDP. In2010, primary expenditure in nominal terms isexpected tostabilise at the 2009 level, while its current component is estimated to growby just 1%, as against the 4½% average annual growthover the previous decade. Public wage dynamics are assumed to remainmoderate thanks to the measures tofreeze wages and restrict recruitment in the public sector, as part of the expenditure-restraint strategy adoptedwith the summer 2008 package. Alsoas part of that strategy, intermediateconsumption is expected tofall slightly in nominalterms, after two years of sizeable increases. Social transfers are assumed to grow more moderatelythan in 2009 as some temporary recovery measures expire. Capital spending is set to fall substantially in 2010, after the rise recorded in 2009, again related to the recovery measures. Finally, interestexpenditure in 2010 still benefits from historicallylow short-term interest rates and is thus anticipatedto remain broadly stable.

In2011, total revenues are expected to rise by justover 2% y-o-y, i.e. less than nominal GDP. Asa result, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is set todecrease relative to 2010. Indirect taxes are set toincrease at a faster pace thanprivate consumption, thanks to the new measures to fight tax evasion.Income taxes paidby households are projected togrow very moderately, also due to the plannedpostponement of some self-assessed tax payments from 2011 to2012, while corporate income taxes are set to increase only marginally as someone-off taxes on corporate assets expire in 2010.  Public expenditure in 2011 is set to increase significantly less than revenues and nominal GDP,thanks to the plannedrestraint in most primarycomponents. This entails a 1pp. reduction in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio relative to 2010. On the current side, the wagebill is bound tofall byalmost 1% y-o-y, while intermediate consumption is expected to increase only slightly. Socialbenefits are set to rise by around3%, as additionalresources have been earmarked for the wagesupplementation scheme (CIG). On the capital side, the retrenchment of public investment andsubsidies is set to continue, also as a consequence of the planned cuts to local authorities' spending. The contraction in capital spending, however, ismagnified by the one-off sale of broadbandlicences, worth around0.2% of GDP, adopted bythe government with the budget 2011-13. Interest expenditure isset torise as from 2011, alsodue tothe still increasingdebt.  The deficitisprojected to go downfurther to3.5%of GDP in2012. Revenues are expected togrow slightly more thannominal GDP, thanksto the additional payment ofpersonal income taxes postponed from 2011. Indirect taxes are insteadprojected to rise in line with the assumed growth in their tax bases. As a result, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise slightly. Expenditure developments are expected to remain quitesubdued, mainly thanks to persistent wagemoderation which, combined with the envisaged continued restriction to recruitment in the public sector, is assumed to keep the total wage bill unchanged. Capital expenditure isprojected todecrease further in2012, though at a slower pace. The expenditure-to-GDP ratio is thus set to fall further. After rising to116% in2009, the debt-to-GDPratio is projected to rise to almost 119% in 2010.The debtratiois set to continue increasing in2011, peak at around 120% and start declining in2012. 12. CYPRUS Economic recovery constrained by domestic and external imbalances 102 The recession has bottomed out– The global economic and financial crisis hitCyprus through a slump in external demand. Afterfive quarters of contracting activity, moderategrowth resumed in the first half of 2010. Assumingthat current trends continue, the economy willgrow by ½% this year.Domestic demand,hitherto the key driver of growth, continued to shrink in the first half of theyear. High household indebtedness, together withtighter lending conditions, a worsening labour market outlook and negative confidence effects, resulted in a further decline in private consumption,  albeit at a slower pace than in 2009. Public consumption, which was expansionary in2009 driven by fiscal stimulus measures in line with the European Economic Recovery Plan(EERP), is estimated to have levelled off. With lacklustre foreign demand for housing and therestructuring of corporate balance sheets,investment is set to remain on a correction path.  Givenhigh import elasticities, contractingdomestic demand was reflected in shrinkingimports. In contrast, the improvement of the external environment led to a pick-up in export growth, especially in financial and businessservices. Inparticular, banks benefited frominflows of deposits, largely owing tounfavourable conditions in Greece. The growth contribution of the tourism sector was marginal, as receipts weresimilar to last year's levels. Overall, the recovery from the crisis brought a welcome adjustment of the external imbalance. The current-account deficit is estimated to have narrowed from a historical high of 17¾% of GDP in2008 to about 6% in2010. The recession has taken a heavy toll on public finances. The government deficit was 6% of GDPin 2009 froma surplus the previous years, on theback of the fading away of the asset boom, a lesstax-rich compositionof growth and the expansionary stance of fiscalpolicy. The deficit is estimated to stabilise close to this level in 2010, while the debt ratio is on a rising trend and expected to exceed the 60% of GDP referencevalue.

In the first twoquarters of 2010, the unemployment rate rose to an averageof 6.8% from 5.2% in 2009. A turnaround since the springof the current year may signal that the worst has passed. –but growth prospects remain subdued The economic recovery that started in 2010 is setto continue into 2011 and to gain momentumin2012, moving towards a more balancedcomposition of growth. Domesticdemand isprojected to expand moderately, driven byrecovering private consumption, on the back ofrising consumer confidence and an improving labour market outlook. However, the constructionsector is set toexperience some further downsizingin the years ahead. Both foreign and domesticdemand for dwellingsshould remain subdued, dueto strong growth of prices in recent years and the high indebtedness of domestic households. Whileother construction, including infrastructure projects, should support investment, it is unlikely that this would be sufficient to fully offset the impact of the fall in housingdemandon total construction investment. Likewise, equipment isset to remain on a downwardtrend.As regards the external sector, imports areprojected torecover and toresume growthin linewith domestic demand, after two years of correction. Exports of goods and services, mainly financial and business services, are set to pick up with the rebound in global trade and an improved Member States, Cyprus 
outlook in Cyprus' main trading partners. All in all, 
the contribution of net exports to GDP growth is 

expected to be positive over the forecast period.  
The Cypriot labour market 
is expected to improve 
gradually over the forecast period, in line with 
strengthening economic activity. Thus, 
employment is projected to rise while 
unemployment should ease from its peak at the end 

of the current year. Nevertheless, moderate growth 

prospects are set to weigh on further inflows of 

low-skilled foreign workers, hitherto employed 

primarily in labour-intensive activities.  
Overall, the balance of risks appears to be neutral. 
Total demand may strengthen beyond expectations 

should growth of Cyprus' major trading partners 

surprise on the upside. Furthermore, improved 

confidence and wage growth could lead to higher 

private consumption. Investment, for its part, may 
be sustained by the implementation of various 
announced construction and infrastructure projects. 
On the other hand, risks associated with adverse 

spillovers from Greece, particularly in view of the 

large exposure of the fina
ncial sector to the Greek 
market, are not negligible. At the same time, 

a tightening of credit conditions, coupled with high 
indebtedness of private agents, could delay the 
rebound in consumption. Furthermore, in a context 
of low growth in both real and nominal terms, the 
rising external debt could become more severe.  
Imbalances weigh on recovery Within this economic outlook, the challenge for 

the Cypriot economy is to return to a balanced 

growth path, leading to further correction of the 

external imbalance in a context of higher potential 

growth. 
The downturn in economic activity was 
accompanied by a significant reduction in the 
current-account deficit of almost 11½ pps. of GDP 

in 2008-10. This improvement occurred despite the 

parallel deterioration in the fiscal position by 

6¾ pps. Overall, this implies an improvement in 

private sector's savings of about 18¼ pps., after 
five years of rising indebtedness and rapid credit 
expansion. The substantial savings of the private 
sector are reflected in subdued consumption and 
shrinking investment and consequently, lower 
growth. 
However, even at around 6% of GDP, the 
current-account deficit is still relatively large and 
likely to constrain economic growth over the 

medium-term. High public sector dissavings need 
to be financed by either foreign debt or higher 

domestic private savings. Thus, the adjustment of 

the current-account deficit would require either 
higher cost of debt-financing or higher private 
sector savings. The latter would imply lower 
output growth by crowding out private 

consumption or investment. In the medium term, 

the deficit is set to continue to improve but at 

a moderate rate. 
Developments in Cyprus' competitiveness, 
especially regarding wage developments, will be 
crucial in determining how sustainable the 

adjustment of the external imbalance will be. In 

particular, nominal compensation per employee is 

projected to increase by about 3% annually on 

average over the forecast period, which exceeds 
projected productivity grow
th. Even in case of no 
or negligible wage increases in the forthcoming 

sectoral collective agreemen
ts, particularly in the 
public sector, the wage drift and indexation 
mechanism (Cost of living allowance; COLA), 
which adjusts wages to inflation over the previous 

6 months, would exert upward pressure on wage 

levels. Productivity growth is expected to remain 

subdued in line with moderate activity and rising 

employment. As a result, unit labour costs should 

rise modestly, although by more than the average 

in the euro area. All in 
all, the gap between wage 

growth and productivity gains is undermining the 

competitiveness of the Cypriot economy.  
Inflation is projected to rise over the forecast 
horizon in line with prices of imported oil, on 
which Cyprus is highly dependent, and the gradual 

recovery of domestic demand. Core inflation is 

likely to remain above the euro-area average, 

mainly reflecting domestic cost pressures. 
Fiscal deficit in need of correction Public finances in Cyprus have deteriorated 

substantially as a result of the crisis and 

discretionary fiscal stimul
us measures, as well as 
rather large composition effects due to a much less 

tax-rich GDP growth pattern. As the economy 

shifts to a more export-oriented pattern, growth 
composition would likely be less tax-intensive, 
thus complicating consolidation efforts.  
The budget deficit appears to have stabilised in 
2010 at a level similar to last year, since 

a marginal increase in revenues is set to be fully

On the one hand,the slowdown of activity and reduced corporate profitability appears toweigh on taxreceipts. In particular, direct tax revenues declined further, dragged down by lower income-tax receipts. Only social contributionsposted positive growth, possibly benefiting from the rise of contributionrates adopted in the first half of the 2009. On the other hand, current expenditure continued to rise, despite the fall in interest payments, on the back of increases in the public wage bill, social outlays and subsidies. Given that revenues benefitedfroma one-off factor of almost ¾ pp. of GDP,associatedwith the profit on an interest swapagreement and a transfer of higher-than-usualCentral Bank profits, the budgetary outcome could have been worse on the basis of underlying fiscaltrends. For 2011, the Draft Budget Law targets a deficit of almost 5½% of GDP, on the basis of an estimated deficit for 2010 of just below 6%ofGDP. On the revenue side, the draft budget does not incorporate any additional measures, apart from thephasing-outof the tax-relief, which was part of thestimulus measures and the harmonisation of excise duties  on petroleum  products,  in effect since lastJuly. Nevertheless, these effects are partly offsetby a reduction in other current revenues. On theexpenditure side, the draft budget aims at savings through a reduction ofoperational expenditure, aswell as restraint inpublic investment and employment. However, these elements are fully offset by a rise in the public wage bill, interest payments and in social outlays.  The present projection is for a deficit of 5¾% of GDP for2011. This incorporates a more prudentassessment of revenue prospects, given a lesstax-richgrowth composition, and on the expenditure side, given past trends onkeyitemssuch as the wagebill andsocial transfers. Measures which are still under discussionwith anuncertainoutcome, orwithno information on the modalities or the timing of implementation are notincorporated in this forecast.  Based on the customary no-policy-changeassumption, the deficit is set to remain at 5¾% of GDP in2012, as gradually rising revenues are offset by higher expenditure. With still moderate growth and an increasing deficit, the debt-to-GDPratiowill rise and reach about68½% by 2012. 13. LATVIA Export driven recovery gains momentum 105 Growth returns sooner than expected Following a very steep contraction in 2009, the Latvian economy recorded three consecutive periodsof quarter-on-quarter growth in 2010 and technically went outof recession. In annualisedterms, outputis recovering at a faster pace thanpreviously expected, although the growthrate in2011 and 2012will remain significantly belowpre-crisis levels and the unemployment rate willstay in the double-digit zonefor years ahead.Exports rose significantly, helped by a global traderesurgence and strong demand from allmajor trade partners. Reduced labourcosts and favourable movements in the real effective exchange rate alsosupported the country's export-driven recovery.Domestic demandremained relatively weak in the first halfof2010, but spillovers from export gains influenced consumption and investment indicators in the third quarter, notably through the rebound in imports and retail trade. The basket of growthcontributors is expected tobe more balanced in future, although exports will maintain a leadingrole for some time.

The service sector reported a rather mixed picture across different sub-sectors with overall modest improvement as key statistics about ports andrailways were still onthe downside. Consumer, investment confidence improves Consumer and business confidence improved inthe course of 2010, but with somemoderation inthe autumn, possibly reflecting uncertainties over the composition of the new government and the forthcoming budgetary consolidation. After a steep fall inhouseholds' incomes in 2009, drivenby lower wages and employment as well as a high debt burden, consumer behaviour shifted toa lower saving propensity than the one recorded atthe heightof the crisis. Private consumption regained momentum through2010 as industrial activity picked up substantially and contraction effects from the fiscal consolidation were largely offset by improved confidence. In the medium run,consumer demandwill be supportedby jobcreation effects as well as gradual moves towardsthe pre-crisis model of a higherspending propensity, although at an aggregate level this willbe somewhat offset by less favourable demographics. In the meantime, increased energyprices, with a high seasonal impact in the winter period, are expected to limit households'purchasingpower and tooffset the risks of a veryquickreturn todemand driven growth, whichcould lead toinflationary pressures and a loss ofcompetitiveness. Fiscal policies will be alsoofkey importance for avoiding such risks and reducinguncertainty. In the corporate sector, the steep rise in salesorders moved capacity utilisation rates close topre-crisis levels in many industries. Nevertheless,investments remained relatively weak inview of the debt repayment efforts,more conservativebank lending policies, and lingering uncertainties in relation to political developments and fiscalreforms. However, many export-orientedmanufacturers are looking to upgrade production capacities and investment demand is expected topick upsubstantially in 2011, supportedby more favourable conditions in the banking sector. Labour market weighs on potential growth The recent shock to the labour market will have lasting effects on potential growth and social policies as significant structural adjustments areneeded inorder to overcome deficiencies. Unemployment declined to 19.4% in the secondquarter of 2010 from an all-time high of 20% inEuropean Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 the first quarter of the year, according to theEurostat seasonally adjusted statistics. The projected economic recovery will continue to support job creation although the process will toa large extent be restrained by the need of export oriented firms to prioritise productivity gains inorder toremain competitive. Therefore employment indicators are likely to rise at amuch slower pace than production output. Nevertheless, the combination of a decreasing and ageing population, as well as migration flows, will have contractionary effects on the labour force and relatively small job creation rates could still have a big positive effect on unemployment in the medium run,which could be further strengthenedby policy actions to eradicate bottlenecks in the labour market. The current estimates show that unemployment could decline by about1½ pps. peryear but this scenario suggests that the job losses in 2008-09will only berecovered over a muchlonger period, running beyond 2015.

Adjustments to the stateregulated energy prices will continue toweighonthe annualised rates until the springof2011, along with the recent recovery of domestic demand and further inflationary impacts fuelled byinternational agricultural prices. Although inflation is expected to accelerate, it should remain below the EU average in 2011 and around the EU average in 2012. Nonetheless, pricesarehighlysensitive to both external factors and changes to domestic demand given existing bottlenecks, making inflation a key challenge in maintaining external competitiveness. The implementation of a further significant fiscal consolidation should be an effective tool for containing inflation risks. External balance signals new readjustment The current-account balance remained in positive territory in 2010, pushed by booming merchandiseexports and large net inflows in income transfers. Exports of goods were still rising faster thanimports but the growthrates' margin contractedsignificantly in relation to2009. Moreover, the current account is now forecast to move back todeficit as early as 2011 in contrast with earlier expectations that the surplus will stay for severalyears. The overall performance in the current account will also depend on the income statements of foreign owned companies, where thelosses booked in2010 have a positive effect on netincome transfers, but the ongoing economicrecovery could reverse the impact as early as 2011. While the current account is not expected to lead to significant external imbalances in the nearfuture, authorities need to keep focusing on the country's competitiveness in order to extend this favourable outlook to the medium and long run.The financial account remained in deficit in the firsthalfof 2010 but the stock of foreign reservescontinued to increase helped by the EU/IMF financing. The net inflow of FDI was very weakduring the same period, while gross FDI inflowsshowed signs of improvement. Given that the latterremain far below the pre-crisis benchmarks, thereis a good chance of rebound as uncertainties on thecountry prospects diminish. Fiscal consolidation at the crossroads  As, so far, the implementation of the 2010budgetseems satisfactory overall, this should allow the authorities to comply comfortably with the 8.5%of GDP deficit ceiling. After three quarters, taxrevenues are better than expected, mostly thanks to value added tax. The final deficit outcome remains subject to uncertainties, given potential overruns and a possible acceleration of spending by the end of the year, including efforts for full absorption ofEU structural funds. Some unsettled commitments, arrears and financial sector costs may also lead to a somewhat higher 2010 ESA outcome, althoughabout 1% of GDP is already included in the forecast deficit of 7.7% of GDP. 106 Member States, Latvia Table II.13.1:Main featuresof country forecast - LATVIA2009Annual percentagechangemio LVLCurr. prices% GDP92-05200720082009201020112012 GDP 13082.6100.01.810.0-4.2-18.0-0.43.34.0 Private consumption8053.861.6-14.8-5.2-24.1-0.53.24.0 Publicconsumption2566.819.6-3.71.5-9.2-4.0-2.6-2.0Gross fixed capital formation2806.821.5-7.5-13.6-37.3-24.89.515.0 of which :  equipment--------- Exports (goodsand services)5741.743.9-10.02.0-14.18.66.06.4 Imports (goods and services)5935.345.4-14.7-11.2-33.57.66.08.5GNI (GDP deflator)14081.2107.61.59.7-2.0-10.8-4.8-1.02.7Contribution to GDP growth :Domestic demand-13.5-8.4-30.7-7.13.55.3Inventories-1.6-4.1-1.56.50.00.0Net exports--5.18.214.20.2-0.1-1.3 Employment-1.73.60.9-13.6-5.60.50.6 Unemployment rate(a)12.56.07.517.119.317.716.2Compensation of employees/head-35.115.7-11.7-4.00.71.8 Unitlabourcosts whole economy-27.222.0-7.0-9.0-2.1-1.5Real unit labour costs-5.86.6-5.6-6.2-2.7-2.5Savingsrate of households (b)------- GDP deflator30.320.314.4-1.5-3.00.61.0 Harmonised index of consumer prices-10.115.33.3-1.31.11.8Terms of trade of goods-7.2-1.8-2.90.00.10.0 Trade balance(c)-13.8-23.9-17.7-7.1-7.7-7.8-8.9 Current-account balance (c)-4.6-22.3-13.18.63.9-0.5-2.9 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-)vis-à-vis ROW(c)-2.2-20.4-11.611.16.41.9-0.6General government balance (c)--0.3-4.2-10.2-7.7-7.9-7.3Cyclically-adjusted budget balance(c)--4.4-6.2-7.2-5.1-6.5-7.0Structural budget balance (c)--4.4-6.2-7.8-6.0-7.1-7.6General government gross debt (c)-9.019.736.745.751.956.6(a)Eurostat definition(b) gross saving divided bygross disposable income (c) as a percentageofGDP107 For 2011, the forecast of 7.9% of GDP does not include new fiscal measures since the draft budgetwill only be adoptedby the government on 7 December 2010 and its measures are still under discussion. Hence, as was the case last year, the forecast represents a baseline before consolidation. Thanks to a better thanexpected macroeconomicenvironment, the consolidation need for 2011hasbeen revised significantly downwards in consultation with the lenders, from 3.0-3.5%ofGDP identified in June 2010, to slightly more than2% of GDP. Ifadopted, this shouldleadto a 2011 deficit below 6% of GDP. It shouldbe noted that the figures mentioned for 2011 and 2012 (and theforecasts) exclude the impact of financial sector measures, for which the temporal distribution isstill difficult to predict at this stage. In the short run, the main risks relate to consolidation fatigue, given the magnitude of theadjustment already implemented over the past two years (15% of GDP), and the possible impact ofthe fiscal consolidation on the economy. The latteris expected tobe at least partially offset bymore sustained investment which is still withheld inview of uncertainties on the ambition of the fiscal course. Over  the  next  two years,  risks  relate  to  financial sector measures and possible arrears or unbudgeted social needs. Financial sector measures may affect the fiscal balance in ESA terms, as already happened with the upward revisionof the 2009 deficit in October (10.2% of GDP instead of 9%, mostly due toa methodologicalchange related to one capital injection). Given current trends, the adjustmentneed to bring the 2012 deficit below 3% of GDP, taking account ofpotential financial sector costs, remains large. Estimates on public debt developments are subjecttosignificant uncertainty. Onthe onehand, risks relating to the financial sector, while more limitedthanoriginally expected, are still difficult toquantify and their temporal distribution remains unclear. On the other hand, a significant part of the amounts committed by bilateral lenders will now be treated as credit facilities and may not be fullydrawn. In addition, the ongoing work towards the definition ofa strategyon the management ofstate-owned firms could possibly lead to theprivatisationof some non-core assets. Overall, public debt would evolve in a more favourableway than previously envisaged, with a peakbelow 60% of GDP.14. LITHUANIA Recovery gathers momentum and becomes broad based 108 Gradual recovery in 2010, supported by export growth Lithuania is recovering from a deep economicrecession. After contracting by nearly 15% in 2009, economic activity is projected to expandbyabout 0.4% in 2010. Growth has been driven by external demand asexports expanded across sectors throughout 2010. Positive export developments havebeen supported by improved cost competitiveness, aided by strongwage disinflation. Moreover, the mainexportpartners Œ inparticular Germany, the otherBaltic states and Russia Œ have been growing more strongly thanpreviously expected. Inflation fellsignificantly to around 1% in 2010 and wageadjustment continued (-5.4% in the secondquarter of 2010) while the current account recordeda surplus for the second year in a row.

The unemployment rate is expected to peak in2010 at close to18%. Non tradablesectors have been most strongly affected. Youthunemployment is particularly high and reached37% in the secondquarter of 2010, resulting ina fresh emigration surge. However, investment has been showing some signs of recovery and depletedinventories are being rebuilt. The absorption of EU structural funds has also picked up. Recovery broadens to domestic demand and gathers pace in 2011 Real GDP grow is expected to accelerate in 2011 as strong export dynamics progressively spurinvestment and ultimately consumption.  After contracting for two years in a row, domesticdemand is projected torebound in2011, reflectingan upturn inprivate investment on the back ofa more favourable business outlook and improved credit flows.At the same time, the real estatemarket seems to have bottomed out in 2010.Moreover, public investmentshould remain strongamid continued commitment to frontloading of EUco-financed projects, related inparticular toinfrastructureand energy efficiency enhancing investments. The labour market is expected to improve progressively, especially during the second half of 2011. Consumer spendingis set toexpand, supportedby employment and wagegrowth, though less strongly than private investment, as households' disposable incomecontinues tobe affected by the ongoing fiscal consolidation. Skill mismatches seem tohaveemerged insome sectors, which may putupwardpressure on private wages over the forecasthorizon.Graph II.14.2:Lithuania - Current-accountbalance-20-15-10-5051000010203040506070809101112%GoodsServicesIncome balanceCurrent transfersCurrent accountbalanceforecastThe external balance is likely to contribute negatively togrowth in2011.

On the other hand, the current-account balance is set to remain positive due to continuinginflows of EUfunds and private sector transfers.  Inflation should increase to2.3% in2011 as oiland other commodity prices on internationalmarkets are expected to increase further. Higher food prices and excise duty increases on tobacco and fuel (as from the beginningof 2011) as well as the expiry of the reduced VAT rate on heating (currently planned in September 2011)will alsoadd to inflation dynamics. The extentofsecond-roundeffects, related to the pass-throughof higher production costs to consumer prices,however, remains uncertain. Core inflation is projected to accelerate only very gradually over the forecast horizon, albeit from very low levels, asdomestic demand gathers momentum.   Following its peak of close to 18% of the labourforce, unemployment is set to moderately decreaseover the forecast horizon, in part due to highemigration. The major challengewill be to ensure that unemployment does not become structural.Labour market mismatches need to be tackled and the restructuring of the economy from non-tradable to tradable sectors, including the diversification towards higher-value added production processes, facilitatedtounderpin future growth prospects.

This expansion is projected to rely on domestic demand as the trade balance deficitwidens further.Domestic demand is set to strengthen towards the end of the forecast horizon as positive expectationsunderpin private investment as well as employment prospects. Public investment growthis also expected to remain positive, while increases in disposableincome triggered by brighter wageand employment outlooks shouldsupportconsumption. Over the medium-term, growthprospects will crucially dependon the depth and speed of the ongoing economic restructuring.Risks related to this baseline scenario seembalanced. On the one hand, stronger-than-expectedgrowth in global trade would support Lithuanian'sexports, facilitating the structural shift towards the tradable sector. An improvedbusiness outlook might also trigger stronger-than-projectedcapital inflows, whichwould further underpin outputgrowth. On the other hand, downside risks relate toslower-than-expected improvement in the labourmarket, insufficient fiscal consolidation as well assetbacks tofinancial stability.  Fiscal outlook Fiscalmeasures amounting to around 8% of GDPin 2009 and 3.7% in 2010helped limitthe public sector deficit, which is expected to narrow to 8.4%in 2010 after reaching 9.2% of GDP in 2009. Themeasures have partlycorrected for the high pre-crisisgrowthof expenditure and thesubsequent sharp fall in revenues as the domestic bubble collapsed in 2009, reinforced by the globaleconomic crisis. Revenue collection in the first eight months of2010has exceeded thegovernment's expectations, even though central government revenue is nearly 5% lower than in thesame period in 2009. In July 2010 the government extended some temporaryexpenditure-reducingmeasures. These include reduced wages for politicians, lawyers andgovernment officials(extendedfor one more year, until the end of 2011) as well as reduced transfers of contributions to the second pillar pension funds (extended until theeconomic situation improves). Moreover,maternity benefits have beensignificantly reducedand some sickness leave benefits are tobepermanently paid by the employers rather than thesocial security fund. However, some other expenditure items, including interest payments,healthcare spending, capital expenditure, and social benefitshave increased in2010. On the whole, fiscal risks are increasing asconsolidation fatigue is reinforced by the electoral 109 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Table II.14.1:Main featuresof country forecast - LITHUANIA2009Annual percentagechangebn LTLCurr. prices% GDP92-05200720082009201020112012 GDP 91.5100.01.29.82.9-14.70.42.83.2 Private consumption63.068.8-12.13.7-17.7-5.92.94.0 Publicconsumption20.121.9-3.27.3-1.9-1.30.02.5Gross fixed capital formation15.717.1-23.0-5.2-40.0-8.513.08.5 of which :  equipment3.74.0-21.9-17.1-49.80.015.010.0 Exports (goodsand services)50.054.6-3.011.6-12.711.06.36.6 Imports (goods and services)51.356.1-10.710.3-28.47.88.18.4GNI (GDP deflator)91.8100.4-8.03.5-10.10.12.74.2Contribution to GDP growth :Domestic demand-14.22.3-22.2-5.83.84.5Inventories-1.31.4-5.34.50.10.0Net exports--5.7-0.712.71.6-1.2-1.2 Employment-0.92.8-0.7-6.8-5.61.12.1 Unemployment rate(a)9.54.35.813.717.816.915.1Compensation of employees/head-13.914.3-11.1-0.21.24.4 Unitlabourcosts whole economy-6.510.4-2.8-6.1-0.43.3Real unit labour costs--1.80.50.9-7.1-2.20.8Savingsrate of households (b)------- GDP deflator40.28.59.8-3.71.11.82.5 Harmonised index of consumer prices-5.811.14.21.22.32.8Terms of trade of goods-0.93.6-5.91.20.10.4 Trade balance(c)--15.0-13.0-3.1-1.1-2.2-3.2 Current-account balance (c)--15.1-13.12.62.61.31.0 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-)vis-à-vis ROW(c)--12.9-11.27.06.95.44.9General government balance (c)--1.0-3.3-9.2-8.4-7.0-6.9Cyclically-adjusted budget balance(c)--3.6-5.5-7.0-6.5-6.0-6.5Structural budget balance (c)--3.0-5.5-7.4-7.1-6.6-7.1General government gross debt (c)-16.915.629.537.442.848.3(a)Eurostat definition(b) gross saving divided bygross disposable income (c) as a percentageofGDP110 cycle and some temporary fiscal consolidation measures are set to expire in the coming years. The2011budget relies onstrong revenue growth tomeet budgetary targets. The draft 2011budgetadopted by the government targets a deficit of 5.8%ofGDP in 2011, in line with the excessivedeficit procedure. In the budget, the governmentexpects better tax compliance and improvedefficiency of state-owned enterprises. Measures toensure the effectiveness of these goals remain to be specified. Tax changes are limited to increases in excise duties on tobacco and fuel according to EU legislation, and some increases in non-tax revenue,which mainly relate to a higher inflow of EU structural funds. The personal income tax rate for the self-employed is to be reducedfrom15% to5%as of2011. The 2011 draft budget foresees a     4.6%  nominal     increase    in  government  expenditure compared to the 2010 budget due tohigher debt service costs and increased social expenditure. General government investment isalso planned to decrease. A contingency provision,in case the budgetary revenue falls short of expectations, has been included in the draft budget. It requires a supplementary budget that would ensure that the 5.8%of GDP target is met.  In2012, some of the temporary consolidation measures includinggovernment wages and reduced social benefits, inparticular pensions, will expire. Hence, on the basis of the customary no-policy-change assumption, the generalgovernment deficit is expected to narrow to 7.0%ofGDPin 2011and 6.9%in 2012. Government debt is expected to increase from over 37% ofGDP in 2010 to around 48% in2012. 15. LUXEMBOURG Strong rebound but future prospects remain exceptionally uncertain 
111 After a severe recession, economic activity is picking up strongly The recession has been severe in Luxembourg but 
the recovery is rather robust too: from peak to 

trough (from the second quarter of 2008 to the 

second quarter of 2009), real GDP fell by 8.0%. 

Since then, it has recovered around two-thirds of 

the loss, rising by 5.4% y-o-y in the second quarter 
of 2010. Like in most other member states, the fall 
in GDP in 2009 was chiefly caused by a collapse 
in investment (-19%) and in exports (-8% of which 
-20% for exports of goods), partially compensated 
by a correlative drop in imports (-10% of which 
-22% for imports of goods). Similarly, the 

recovery in 2010 is essentially being generated by 

investment and exports, wh
ich are expected to rise 

by about 8½% and 10% respectively, while 

imports should increase by about 12%. Private 
consumption, which slowed down from 4.8% in 
2008 to 0.3% in 2009, probably as a side-effect of 
the strong rise in unemployment and the 
deterioration in consumer confidence, is 

strengthening again and should increase by more 

than 2% in 2010. In total, real GDP should grow 
by about 3¼% this year after falling by 3.7% in 
2009. 
This rather strong growth momentum is expected 
to continue in 2011-12 as domestic demand will 
strengthen and external trade will probably remain 
rather supportive. In total,
 real GDP growth should 
decelerate somewhat in 2011 and slightly 
reaccelerate in 2012, followi
ng the general trend of 
the EU, while remaining in the neighbourhood of 

3%. Although such growth rates are substantially 
higher than those currently
 expected for most other 
Member States, they are 
also significantly below 

the average rates recorded in Luxembourg before 

the crisis. In a longer perspective, future prospects 

are very unclear for the Luxembourgish economy. 
The financial sector, which has been the country's 
main growth engine in recent decades and now 
represents almost 30% of 
total value added, seems 
to have withstood the crisis rather well, but the 
future of financial activity at the world level is 
exceptionally uncertain. Moreover, the sector is 

extremely internationalised in its ownership and 

activities, which makes it particularly sensitive to 
developments abroad.      
Employment has been exceptionally resilient but unemployment will not decline much in the 
coming years Employment performed particularly well during 
the recession and its resilience surprised even the 

most optimistic observers. 
It decelerated strongly 
from the very high growth rates recorded in 2008 

(4.8% over the year) to about 0.1% y-o-y in the 

autumn of last year but it never decreased in 
absolute value and, in yearly average, it still rose 
by 0.9% in 2009 Œ the highest figure in the whole 
EU, where it declined by 
1.9% on average. This 
massive labour hoarding was probably due to 

a large part to the reluctance of firms to lay off 
people whom they had found difficult to hire 

during the boom years, but it was also helped by 

a systematic recourse to short time working 

encouraged by the government. Employment is 

growing strongly again, 
by about 2¼% a year in 
recent months. It is expected to rise by about 1¾% 
this year and to contin
ue to accelerate over the forecast period, growing by 2% in 2011 and 
slightly more in 2012.  
Unemployment has risen significantly in recent 
years, from about 4.2% of the active population in 

the spring of 2008 to around 6% in the first half of 

2010. It strongly accelerated 
in the autumn of 2008 
but began to slow down in the course of 2009; it 
has been broadly stable since the beginning of this 
year. However, the stro
ng job creation expected 
over the forecast period will probably not result in 

a significant decline in unemployment. Indeed, 
unemployment has an increasingly structural 
character in Luxembourg (even though its large 
increase since 2008 is clear
ly a consequence of the 
recession). Evidence of this 
is the fact that it hardly 
declined during the good years 2004-07 despite the 
very strong employment growth recorded at that 

time: it took employment to rise by more than 

3½% a year for unemployment to decrease 
marginally and relatively briefly, from the 
beginning of 2007 to the spring of 2008. Like in 
the previous boom period, job creation is thus 
expected to most benefit non-resident workers, 
whose number has once again been rising faster 
than national employment in recent months (by 

more than 2½% a year, compared with about 2% 

for residents' employment).

It reached 2.8% on averageover the first three quarters of2010 and will probably amount to the samefigure for the year asa whole. Inflation is projectedto decelerate slightly in 2011 and more strongly in 2012, reaching about2% and 1½% respectively, provided thefactors behind the acceleration observed this year, inparticular, the surge in the prices of oil and other basic commodities, weaken as expected. Wages had risen by3.5% a year on average during the good years 2004-07. They sloweddown to 2.0%on average in2008 and 2009 and are expected torise by a similar amount in 2010-11. They shouldslightly accelerate in 2012due to an indexation threshold foreseen at the end of 2011 and theprojected acceleration in job creation.  The government balance deteriorated substantially but the deficit remains contained The generalgovernment balance, which hadamounted to a surplus of 2.9% in 2008, turned intoa 0.7% deficit in 2009, the lowest deficit recordedin 2009 in the EU, in large part thanks to the favourable situation of public finance before the crisis. The deficit will increase to about 1¾% of GDP this year because, partly as a result of the delayed impact of the crisis, government revenues are still forecast to rise more slowly thanexpenditure even though they are recovering aftera slight decline in 2009. In 2011, the deficit isprojected to decrease to about 1¼% as a result of the consolidation package decided by the government in the spring of this year. Revenues, in particular taxes paidby households, shouldaccelerate, while expenditure will slow down after three years of strong growth (about 8.5%a yearon average from 2008 to2010). Governmentinvestment, notably, is planned to decrease byabout 2½% of GDP next year. In 2012,at unchanged policy, the deficit is forecast to stabilise at around1¼% of GDP. The public debt, which amounted to 14.5% ofGDP in 2009, it is expected to rise to around 20% of GDP atthe end ofthe forecasting period,which is still one of the lowest in the EU. The increase isessentially a result of the financing of the deficits of the central government. The social security system, on the other hand, should continue to runsubstantial surpluses, which, like in the past, willbe used to increase its reserves, the amount ofwhich is now estimated at more than30% of GDP. 16. HUNGARY Recovery firming up, yet fiscal challenges remain 113 The crisis impact was severe in 2009  In autumn 2008, Hungary was hit markedly hardby the global financial crisis, culminating with theloss of market access. As the government implemented its adjustment programme supportedby a joint EU-IMF financial package, the situationstabilized and market access was regained in July. Nonetheless, credit conditions tightenedsignificantly, as banks struggled todeleverage.Declining real wages and growing unemployment in the context of large exposure to foreign currency debt and the depreciating forint boostedprecautionarysavings in the household sector anddepressed consumption. Firms trimmed investmentback reflecting uncertainty about future demandand ample unused capacity. In the event, economicactivity declined by around 6¾% in 2009, despite a large positive contribution from netexports(mostly as a result of the sharpdecline in imports). A moderate recovery is underway Since early in 2010, financial market conditionshave continued to improve, uncertainty about therecoveryhas gradually subsided, and investorconfidence has picked up, as shown by severalnew flagship investments by large multinationals(benefiting in particular the auto industry, with car production capacity  now set to expand tomatchthat of Slovakia).

9101112GDP growth (lhs)Unemployment rate (rhs)forecast% of labour forceThe pick-up in economic activity has beensupported mostly by recovering exports reflecting better than expected global trade demand. Thehealthy performance of the German manufacturing sector has inparticular led to an upward revisionfor GDP growth, now expected to reach 1.1% in2010.  In contrast toexports, domestic consumption hasremained predictably subdued. Highunemployment and, more recently, higher interestcosts on Swiss franc-denominated mortgages due to the depreciation of the Hungarian forint have kept a lidondisposable income and consumption.  Looking forward The dichotomous nature ofthe recovery that has taken place so far will be mediated by the effects of severalrecently announced policy measures. Household consumption is expected to receivea boost from the personal income tax (PIT) reforminstituting a combination of a 16% flat tax with substantial tax credits for those with children.The positive current income effect of the lower PIT taxes for most wage earners is nevertheless likelyto be tempered by: (i) the fact that the tax cutmainly supports those households  with  higherwages and a lower marginal propensity toconsume; (ii) the fact that roughly 40% oftaxpayers are childless and without a high enoughincome to benefit from the tax reform;(77) and (iii) likely higher precautionary savings in response to the diversionof pension contributions withoutclear prospects of compensation and concerns about increasingpublic debt in the long term.  Unemployment will also start to modestly decline over the course of2011. Labour supply (especiallyfor high-skilled individuals) is expected to beboosted by the declining labour tax wedge, whileemployment and, especially, investment willreceive a further boost fromthe corporate incometax cut and fromthe significant FDI projectsannounced in the autumn of2010. At the same time, the temporary levies that havebeen announced inorder tobring the budgetdeficitbelow the 3% of GDP threshold may have anunfavourable impact on investment andconsumption.The financial sector levy is likely todampen credit to corporations and tohouseholds.The further extra levies on energy, telecoms and retailmay have a negative impact on the business(77)Calculations by the Fiscal Council published on November 8, 2010.European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
environment through increased institutional 
uncertainty, and are also likely to keep inflation 

above target (as the incipient recovery increases 

firms' pricing power). 
Temporary improvement of the fiscal stance In the autumn notification, the 2009 budget deficit 

was revised up to 4.4% of GDP from the previous 

estimate of 4% of GDP mainly due to higher than 

expected investments. The revised outcome is well 

above of the target of 3.
9% of GDP for that year. 
Although the central government cash deficit of 
3.5% of GDP was better than expected, this largely 
reflects factors that have no impact in national 
accounts terms (such as the advance payments of 
dividends and late payments of certain tax 
refunds). 
In 2010, the headlin
e budget deficit target of 3.8% 
of GDP is expected to be met, despite expenditure 
slippages of 1½% of GDP and revenue shortfalls 
of 1% of GDP compared
 to the budget. These 
slippages partly reflect (i) a lack of tight 
expenditure control, (ii) a larger than foreseen 
participation in the Pathway to Work Programme, 
(iii) a sharper than expected drop in revenues as a 
result of the economic downturn in 2009, as well 

as (iv) unfavourable court decisions. Moreover, 

a corporate income tax cut and the abolishment of 

some smaller tax items lowered revenues by ¼% 

of GDP. Beside the cancellation of budgetary 

reserves of ½% of GDP, the new government 

implemented deficit-decreasing measures of close 

to 2% of GDP.
(78) In June, it introduced a first 
consolidation package comprising an extra levy on 

financial institutions of 0.7% of GDP and saving 

measures of 0.4% of GDP. In October, it decided 

on additional extra levies of 0.6% of GDP on 

selected sectors and to divert for 14 months 
(through the end of 2011) to the public pension 
fund the part of pension contributions normally 
transferred to the private pension pillar. The latter 
decision is expected to result in additional revenue 
of 0.2% of GDP in 2010. 
In 2011 the headline deficit 
is expected to increase 
to around 4¾% of GDP). On the revenue side, this 
forecast incorporates (i) 
the personal income tax 
(78) Lower than budgeted interest expenditure and one-off 
revenue from the switch of people from the second pillar to 
the first pillar of the pension system also lowered the 
deficit by ½% of GDP. The currently higher expected 
economi
c growth in 2010 vs. 
the forecast in the budget 
hardly results in higher budgetary revenues since it mainly 
reflects the boom of relatively tax-poor net exports. 
cut of 1.8% of GDP compared to 2010 and (ii) the 
additional revenue loss of ¼% of GDP stemming 

from the corporate income tax cut implemented 

from mid-2010, partly offs
et by (iii) the temporary 
diversion of the pension contributions of 1.3% of 

GDP. Moreover, this forecast assumes that the 
extra levies of 1.3% of GDP introduced in 2010 
will be maintained and 
takes into account the 
positive impact of the economic recovery. On the 

expenditure side, the forecast includes: 
(i) a decrease in real terms of the public sector 
gross wage bill and of the social benefits;
(79)(ii) lower local government sector investment by 
0.3% of GDP relative to 2010 (an electoral year); 
and (iii) a  budgetary reserve of 0.4% of GDP.  In 
addition, the absorption of the EU funds is 
expected to be accelerat
ed, resulting in higher 
co-payments, but this will partly offset investments 
from own resources. On the other hand, the draft 

budget does not includ
e plans for significant 
structural reforms (e.g. in the public transport 

sector, price subsidies, the local government sector 

or social benefits) and therefore no savings are 
expected from this source. 
Moreover, in contrast to 
the draft budget, our forecas
t also does not include 
the possible effects of the recent opening of the 
option to switch from the private pillar back to the 
public pension scheme. Assuming a 20% take-up 
of this offer, as in the draft 2011 budget, the 

headline deficit would be lower by 2% of GDP, 

and thus close to the deficit target in the draft 

budget of 2.94%. The public debt could decline by 

around 1% of GDP since about half of the private 
pension funds` assets are invested in Hungarian 
government bonds.
(80)Deteriorating medium-term fiscal outlook In 2012 the headline defic
it is forecast to increase 
again above 6% of GDP mainly due to the 
phasing-out of the temporary divergence of the 

pension contributions, the planned decrease of the 

extra levy on the financial institutions to around 

% of GDP and the further personal income tax 
cut of 0.8% of GDP adopted by Parliament. These 
deficit increasing eff
ects are only partly 
counterbalanced by th
e forecast impact of 
accelerating economic growth.  
(79) In part this reflects the expected savings from the 
restructuring of the public work scheme and the 
elimination of the complementary salary in the public 
sector. (80) The transfer of the other assets will increase the public 
sector wealth and decrease the net public debt but not 

automatically the gross public debt.

MALTA A stronger than expected recovery 
116 A stronger than expected rebound in the first 
half of 2010– The recession in Malta st
arted at the end of 2008 
and lasted three quarters. Its total impact in terms 
of real GDP contraction over 2009 was one of the 

mildest in the euro
 area, at 2.1% compared to 4.1% 
for the euro-area average.
 The decline in exports, 
together with the sharp retrenchment of 
investment, mainly machinery and housing 
construction, and the depletion of inventories were 
the key drivers of the dec
line in real GDP in 2009. 
However, the high import-intensity of exports and 

investment led to the fall in imports being steeper 
than that in exports. Fu
rthermore, private and 
government consumption had a broadly neutral 

impact on GDP developments in 2009.  
The first half of 2010 witnessed a stronger than 
expected rebound in economic activity. 
Year-on-year real GDP 
growth until the second 
quarter is estimated to reach 4%, mainly resulting 
from a strong rebound in external demand. The 

steep increase in exports, 
primarily of machinery, 
was only partly offset by the increase in imports, 

of mainly industrial supplies. Domestic demand, 

however, remained more subdued.  
–is expected to soften in the latter part of the 
year The slower growth of real GDP in the second 
quarter this year Œ 0.1% q-o-q compared to 1.4% 

in the first quarter Œ may be indicative of 

a slowdown in the momentum of economic 

recovery. Real GDP growth in 2010 as a whole is 

in fact forecast to expand
 by 3.1%, as the positive 
contribution of net trade is expected to moderate in 
the second half of the year. This is due to a less 
buoyant external environment outlook for the latter 
part of the year, also related to the phasing out of 
the recovery measures in a number of EU member 
states, and a stronger euro 
than in the first half of 
the year.  Domestic demand is expected to pick up strongly 
during the course of the year. This is mainly due to 
a sharp increase expected for public investment, 
partly financed from EU grants, in the latter half of 
the year. Notwithstanding 
a moderate increase in 
real disposable income as a result of weak wage 

growth and higher energy prices, private 
consumption is forecast to
 start growing again, 
mainly due to the more favourable labour market 

conditions already seen in the second quarter this 

year. Government consumption is expected to 

rebound, also due to the temporary recovery 

measures adopted with the 2010 Budget.   
In 2011-12, domestic demand is expected to 
continue to be the main contributor to real GDP 
growth. Investment growth is again expected to be 
particularly strong. Incr
eases in machinery and 
non-residential construction will underpin private 
investment, while residential construction is set to 

pick up in 2012. However investment dynamics 

are likely to be driven by public investment 

resulting from the expected increased absorption of 
EU grants, as mentioned earlier. As households' 
disposable income and consumer confidence are 
expected to improve further due to the anticipated 
better labour market conditions, private 
consumption growth is set to accelerate. As 
a result of the pick up in both consumption and 

investment, imports are ex
pected to grow faster 
than exports, with the contribution of net trade 

expected to turn slightly negative. 
Also, labour market conditions are improving 
faster than expected– Labour market conditions improved significantly 
in the first half of this year. Employment was seen 

to grow faster than labour supply, which has led to 

a decline in the unemployment rate from its peak 

of 7.2% at the end of 2009 down to 6.2% in 

September this year. Employment is expected to 
expand by 1.1% this year, and to rise at a slightly 
higher rate in 2011-12. Malta's unemployment rate 
is expected to fall to 6.5% on average in 2010, 
remaining broadly stable in the coming two years 
on the back of an increase in labour supply in line 
with that in employment.  
Yearly wage growth in 
Malta averaged 4.3% over 
the last decade. For 2010, 
wage growth is expected 
to remain relatively subdued, picking up towards 
the end of the year and becoming more dynamic in 
2011 in line with employment developments. 
A further acceleration is an
ticipated for 2012, also 
explained by the anticipated higher pressure from 

the cost-of-living adjust
ment mechanism (COLA). 
Member States,Malta Labour productivity is set to rebound in 2010following the strong economic recovery experienced in the first half of the year and a lagged adjustment of employment to economicgrowth. Productivity gains are expected tomoderate over the forecast horizon in line withpasttrends. Againstthis background, unitlabourcosts are expected to fall in2010, after the steeprise recorded in 2009, and to increase again by an average of2% over 2011-2012. –with inflation expected to be energy-driven  HICP inflation is expected to average 1.9% in 2010, remainbroadly stable in 2011 and increaseto 2.3% in 2012, as private consumption accelerates.  After decelerating in 2010, food inflation is again expected to become an important contributor toHICP inflation, given the assumed increase inglobal food commodity prices over theforecast horizon. An increase in excise duties on alcohol and tobacco is also expected to have a relatively strong impact on processed food inflation.  Services inflation is expected to be one of thedriving factors behind the rise in inflation in thefinal months of the current year and throughout theforecast horizon, partly reflecting improved demand conditions as well as the announcedincrease in the rate of VAT for hotel and private accommodation from 5% to 7% as from 2011.  Graph II.17.1:Malta - HICPand itscomponents-101234500010203040506070809101112pps.ServicesProcessed foodUnprocessed foodEnergyNon-energy industrial goodsHICP (y-o-y%)forecastVarious factors are at play in driving energy inflation over the forecast horizon. Dynamicenergy prices have highly characterised HICP inflation inMalta in recent years. Besides the changes in international oil prices, the gradualremoval of electricity and, more recently, gas subsidies, has resulted in the energy componentsubstantially contributing tothe changes in HICP inflation. The recent commitment by thegovernment to keep electricity tariffs in 2011 fixed at the 2010rate will help to partly compensate for the expected pick up in fuel prices, which areaffected by the announced increase in excise duty. In2012, energy inflation is expected to bedrivenagain by electricity given the expected reversal of the measure implemented in2011.  The need to restore public finances Malta maintained a relatively sound budgetary position in the years following EU accession in2004. The general government deficit, however,widened markedly in 2008 to 4.8% of GDP, mainly due to some exceptional expenditure-increasing items related tothe liquidation of the shipyards and temporary subsidies to the energyprovider. The deficit ratio narrowed in 2009 to3.8% of GDP, mainly due to the expiry of the above-mentioned exceptional expenditure items, lower public investment and one-off tax receipts resultingfroma tax amnesty. In2010, the deficit is expected to widen to4.2% of GDP, mainly due togrowth of currentprimary expenditure outpacing that in tax collection. On the expenditure side, compensation of employees is set to increase moderately, helpedby favourable baseeffects related to the liquidation of the shipyards. By contrast, intermediate consumption is projectedto increase markedly, mainly because of the additional temporary recovery measures in the 2010 budget. Socialtransfers other thanin kindareprojected to keep increasing at a fast pace due to the dynamics of age-related entitlements. Capitalspending is also expected to increase substantially mainly thanks to public investment projects inenvironment and infrastructure and support toprivate investment, partly financed withthe EUfunds.  Tax revenue is expected to remain relativelymoderate in 2010. Indirect taxes are affected by still weak consumptiondynamics. The overall moderate increase in wages and the one-off effect of the tax amnesty in 2009 are both anticipated to weigh on direct tax dynamics in 2010. Finally, social contributions are set to increase by morethan the economy-wide wage bill after the buoyant outturn recorded in the first half of the year. 117 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Table II.17.1:Main featuresof country forecast - MALTA2009Annual percentagechangemio EURCurr. prices% GDP92-05200720082009201020112012 GDP 5749.7100.03.53.72.6-2.13.12.02.2 Private consumption3636.063.2-0.94.40.01.01.62.1 Publicconsumption1246.721.7-0.012.8-0.72.40.41.9Gross fixed capital formation848.614.8-5.9-27.5-16.39.68.23.3 of which :  equipment--------- Exports (goodsand services)4265.174.2-2.7-3.0-7.619.06.36.2 Imports (goods and services)4234.773.7--0.8-2.9-10.618.16.56.3GNI (GDP deflator)5369.393.42.84.32.4-4.94.12.52.6Contribution to GDP growth :Domestic demand-1.9-0.8-2.72.42.32.3Inventories--1.63.3-2.50.10.00.0Net exports-3.40.03.10.6-0.3-0.1 Employment1.03.22.6-0.51.11.21.4 Unemployment rate(a)6.56.45.97.06.66.66.5Compensation of employees/head5.02.03.72.30.62.03.0 Unitlabourcosts whole economy2.51.53.83.9-1.41.22.1Real unit labour costs-0.1-1.41.51.6-4.3-1.4-0.4Savingsrate of households (b)------- GDP deflator2.63.02.22.33.02.72.5 Harmonised index of consumer prices-0.74.71.81.92.02.3Terms of trade of goods--0.21.1-1.84.91.30.7 Trade balance(c)-18.3-17.9-21.4-16.5-14.8-14.9-15.2 Current-account balance (c)--6.2-5.6-6.1-3.9-2.9-2.2 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-)vis-à-vis ROW(c)--5.2-5.1-4.8-2.1-0.9-0.2General government balance (c)--2.3-4.8-3.8-4.2-3.0-3.3Cyclically-adjusted budget balance(c)--2.4-5.0-2.9-3.9-2.9-3.5Structural budget balance (c)--3.0-5.3-3.5-4.5-3.3-3.5General government gross debt (c)-61.763.168.670.470.870.9(a)Eurostat definition(b) gross saving divided bygross disposable income (c) as a percentageofGDP118 The deficit is projected to narrow substantially in2011, to 3.0% ofGDP. Partof the deficit reduction (around ½ pp. of GDP) is related to the expiry ofsome temporary support measures adopted withthe 2010 Budget. Another ½ pp. of GDPimprovement is due to the assumed strict implementation ofthe 2011 budget. Finally, anexpected marked acceleration in tax collection related to the ongoing economic recovery explains the remaining ¼ pp. of GDP adjustment.Meanwhile, the forthcoming restructuring of AirMalta may entail additional governmentexpenditure and thus represents an upward risk for the 2011 deficit forecast.  Regarding expenditure, current primary expenditure is expected to decelerate in 2011, mainly due to the expiry of some recoverymeasures, the assumed moderation in public wagesand the projected efficiency gains. After the rebound anticipatedfor 2010, capital expenditure is set to continue to increase strongly due to the expected improvement in EU funds absorption. Onthe  revenue  side, direct  taxes are set to accelerate on the back ofboth improved corporate profitability as well as higher households' income.Indirect taxes will benefit fromthe increase inexcise duties adoptedwith the 2011 budget and the acceleration in private consumption, while social contributions are set to increase more moderately.   In 2012, basedon a no-policy-change assumption,the deficit is anticipated towiden again to 3.3%ofGDP mainly due to the projected lower impact of one-off measures and still-substantial increases expected incapital spending, although partly financed with EU funds. Current primaryexpenditure and current revenues are set to grow at a similar pace. After increasing by nearly 7 pps. of GDP in2008-09, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected tocontinue on an upward path over the forecasthorizon, increasing from 68.6% to around 71% by2012. This is partly explained by the need tofinance the rescue loan provided to Air Malta that implies an increase of more than ¾ pp. ofGDP in the debtratio as from 2010.  18. THE NETHERLANDS 
A slow-paced recovery sets in 
119 The recovery that started in the second half of 
2009– The Dutch economy has been recovering from the 
global financial and economic crisis since the 

second half of 2009, initially mainly as a result of 

the favourable developments in world trade. As 

one of the most open economies in the European 

Union, the Netherlands benefitted from a strong 
rebound in exports, which entailed a very positive 
contribution of net exports to GDP growth. On the 
other hand, domestic demand growth remained 
weak throughout 2009. Lagged effects of the 
financial and economic crisis continued to impact 
both private consumption and investment. The 

latter was also affected by the low capacity 

utilisation rate.  
Domestic demand turned around sharply in the 
second quarter of 2010, resulting in the economic 
recovery gaining significant momentum, with 
quarter-on-quarter GDP growth of 0.9%. Domestic 

demand in the second quarter benefited from 

a strong upswing in th
e inventory cycle and 
a rebound of investment, in particular in 

equipment. Net exports however, put a drag on 

growth, as imports significantly outperformed 

exports in both the first and the second quarter of 

2010. 
Despite the significantly positive contribution of 
domestic demand to GDP growth in the first half 
of 2010, private consumption growth remained 
subdued.  The decrease in 
real disposable income 
in 2009 in combination with lagged negative 

wealth effects, in both fi
nancial and non-financial 
assets and residual negative confidence effects 
prevented households from increasing 
consumption. A surge in households' energy 
consumption in the first quarter, related to the 
relatively low temperatures, briefly interrupted this 
negative pattern. 
–is expected to become more moderate in 
the coming period The outlook points to a moderation of economic 
growth, as a result of an 
expected slowdown in the 
external environment, co
mbined with a planned 
restrictive fiscal policy 
stance starting in 2011. 
With respect to the latter, the government will end 

the stimulus package that was implemented in 
response to the crisis and enact a strong budgetary 

correction throughout the government's term of 
office up to 2015. The plans of the new 
government are expected to have a non-negligible 
impact on economic 
activity, especially on 
government and private consumption and 

investment.  
With the rebound in investment in the first half of 
2010 being mainly based on replacement 
investment and no urgent need as yet to increase 
capacity, the strength of its recovery is expected to 
be more moderate over the forecast period than 
may be assumed by the strong surge in the second 
quarter of 2010. 
The less buoyant outlook for world trade and the 
projected appreciation of th
e euro are expected to 
have a dampening impact on Dutch exports. This 
should largely counterbal
ance an improvement in 
Dutch competitiveness coming from the downward 
adjustment of unit labour costs in 2010. All in all, 
net exports are foreseen to
 moderately contribute 
to economic growth in 2011-12. In line with the 

net contribution of exports, the current account is 
foreseen to improve agai
n to a surplus of around 
8% of GDP in 2012.  
Private consumption is not expected to take 
over the role as growth driver Following the normal sequence of events in the 
aftermath of a recession, 
a significant rebound of 
net exports followed by a robust increase in 

investment would be followed by rising private 

consumption. The outlook for private consumption 

however, does not point to a buoyant recovery. 
Private consumption growth is expected to remain 
subdued throughou
t the forecast period. Recent 
wage agreements already point to a strong and 

rapid decrease in wage growth. For the short to 
medium run, the government envisages a policy of 
wage moderation in the public sector, which may 

also have some spill-over effects on private sector 

wage dynamics. Additionally, only limited support 

for private consumption is expected to come from 

labour market developments, in spite of the latter 
having outperformed expect
ations in the recession.  
However, a positive impetus on private 
consumption in the short run may come from the 

decision by the previous government to unblock 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 savings by employees, which are held on a blockedbank account, and total aroundEUR 4 bn. This effect is however expected tobe rather small and to affect mainly 2010. Furthermore, in the short run, private consumption could benefit from anincrease in consumer confidence and thefading out of negative wealth effects. Wealth and confidence effects can have a strong impact on private consumption, as was witnessed during thecrisis, whengross disposable income turned onlyslightly negative in 2009, but private consumption fell by2.5%.  The moderate growth of the Dutch economy,combined with subdued wage growth and a modest outlook for private consumption, is expected tokeep core inflation at relatively low levels in the next two years, at 1.2% and 1.3% in2011 and 2012, respectively. As regards HICP, energypricesare expected to positively contribute to inflation as the oil price in euro is assumed tobeon the upthroughout the forecast period. Processed food prices including alcohol and tobacco are expected to be positively influenced by the planned increase in taxes on tobacco in 2011, but its overall effect is expected to be limited. Overall, HICP inflation is projected to increase from 1% in 2010 to1.5% and1.6% in2011 and 2012, respectively.  This scenario is subject toboth positive and negative risks. On the positive side, developments in the labourmarket could turn out to bemore favourable and/or growth inemerging economies stronger than foreseen. However, on the negativeside, lower than expectedglobal demand may poserisks to the growth outlook. Furthermore, risks tothe stability of the financial sectorhavenot yetfully disappeared.  Labour market continues to surprise on the upside, but no strong rebound expected The Dutch labour market has weathered the crisis relatively well. Despite the severe economic crisis, the unemployment rate increased by only 0.6 pp. to3.7% in 2009, therebyremaining one ofthe lowestin the EU. Data on unemployment developments at the start of the second half of2010 point towards a stabilisation of the unemployment rate at around 4½%. One of the main elements explaining the relatively limited increase in unemployment over the pastyears stems from the demand side. At the dawnofthe crisis, the labour market in the Netherlandswas extremely tight, with the number ofunfilled vacancies matching the number of unemployed. In these circumstances, it proved to be very difficultfor employers to attract and retainqualifiedpersonnel. When demanddecreased inthe recession, employers were reluctant to fire personnel,which led to a strong policy of labourhoarding. On the labour supply side, the effects ofthe crisis onthe unemployment rate were alsomitigated through the effect of discouraged workers. This effect most notably affected young persons who decided to continue studying. After a decrease of employment in 2010, it is notexpected that employment will pick up in line withthe recovery of the economy, as corporations will first increase the hours worked by their employees, for instance by reversing the measures that wereintroducedduring the crisis, such as the part-timeworking scheme. A secondelement supporting theview of a modest recovery in employment in thecoming years stems from the consolidation policyof the new Dutch government aiming to reduce thesize of government, which is expected tohavea negative impact on employment growth. On theother hand, the discouraged worker effect isexpected to diminish, also on the back of a positive, although moderate, expected growth in employment starting in2011 and continuingin 2012.

In 2010, the deficit is expected todeteriorate further to a deficit of 5.8% of GDP. The most important reason for the further deterioration, besides the continuation of the stimulus package, is the impact of various laggedeffects of the economic crisis, in particular the expectedfurther increase inunemployment. The new government has committed itself toa significantly frontloaded consolidationof public finances. This consolidation effort is mainlyconcentrated on government administrative expenditure, subsidies, international cooperation and income transfers. A strong improvement in the general government balance is foreseen in 2011, with the deficit decreasing to 3.9% ofGDP from 5.8% of GDP in 2010. This sizeable improvement is partly the result of the consolidationmeasures already presented in the Budget for 2011, amounting to½% of GDP as well as the start ofthe consolidation plans foreseen in the new coalition agreement amounting to ¼% of GDP in 2011. For the remainder the improvement isprimarily the result of the ending of the stimuluspackage already decided by the previousgovernment in the Budget for 2011, a positive contribution of cyclical conditions and somewhat higher gas revenues. For 2012, the government foresees a further consolidation effort of ½% of GDP, leading to an additional improvement in the general government balance, which is forecast torecorda deficitof 2.8% ofGDP.

AUSTRIA Steady recovery facilitating fiscal consolidation 122 Rebound in 2010 driven by exports Having stagnated inthe first quarter of 2010, GDPgrew by 1.2% and 0.9% q-o-q in the second andthirdquarters respectively, reflecting the improved situation in the world economy. Growth wasdriven, onthe onehand, by net exports benefiting from stronger economic activity in Germany(Austria'smain trading partner) and, on the other hand, by the returnof gross fixed capital formationto positive growth in spring2010 after sevenquarters of decline. Industrial production reacted strongly to the rebound in world trade and dynamic external demand. Austria was the first country in the EU inwhich capacity utilisationin the manufacturing sector surpassed its long-termaverage after the crisis. However, the negativetrend in construction investment continued toprevail. Moderately growing private consumption was a stabilisingfactor, as households took advantage ofadditional elements of the 2009 tax reform (in particular, relief for families with children and tax cuts for the self-employed). Overall real GDP growthis expected to reach around 2% in 2010. It is expected that the maincontribution to growth will come from net exports, although there are signs that the momentum may be slowing. In spite of the continued growth ofinvestment inequipment since the second quarterof this year, the latter will still fall inannualaverage terms in2010 because of a substantial negative carry-over from the previous year. A small positive contribution is expected from the inventories cycle. 2011 and beyond: shift towards domesticdemand forces GDP is forecast togrowby about 1.7% in2011and 2.1% in 2012. Whereas the recovery in2010 relied heavily on external demand, growth in the remaining forecast years is predicted to be more broad-based. Investment in machinery and equipment is set to return topositive yearly growthagainst the background of the revival in industrial production and rising capacity utilisation, andunderpinned by an improvement in corporatebalance sheets. The advanceddepreciation allowance, introduced as a part of the fiscalstimulus package, is likely to encourage companiesto invest in new production facilities, while alsoreplacing old capital stock vintages. However, the continued decline in the number of buildingpermits suggests that investment in constructionwill remain subdued.In 2011, private consumption may be affected bythe withdrawal of the temporary stimulus measuresand phasing in of the fiscal consolidation measuresdescribed below. However, as the householdsaving rate is expected toedge down somewhat andpositive developments in the labour marketshould boost consumer confidence, only a slightdeceleration in private consumption growth isforecast for 2011. It is assumed that public consumption growth will come to a halt in 2011 in the context of the fiscal consolidation efforts, but will resume thereafter.

In particular, the projected deceleration of Germany's goods imports is of key importance toAustria, as one-third of the country's exports aredestined for its northern neighbour. In addition,Italy and Switzerland, respectively Austria'ssecond and third most important trading partners,are facing moderate domestic demand growth. Last butnot least, demand from the Central and EasternEuropean Countries, whose importance as Austria's tradingpartners grew significantly in thelast decade, is also expected toslacken. Nevertheless, as the trade balances forboth goods and services is expected to gradually improveduring the forecast period, the current-accountsurplus is likely to returntoits pre-crisis level of about 4% ofGDP in 2012. Member States, Austria Moderate inflation and wage growth Consumer prices rose by1.6% on averagein the first three quarters of 2010 and were mainlydrivenby higher energy prices. Some dampening effectshave come from slower wages growth than in the previous year. Overall, inflation is forecast at 1.7%in 2010. In2011, the inflation rate is expected to rise slightly above 2% on the backof the increase in the taxes on fuel and cigarettes agreed on by the government coalition partners as part of the consolidationpackage. Inflation is likely to fallonce again below 2% in the following year. It isassumed that oil prices will continue to exert upward, yet diminishing, pressure throughout the forecast period. The profile for industrial goods prices is expected toremain flat. Overall, inflation should be driven somewhatmore by servicesprices aswages pickup slightly and previousenergy prices increases are translated into costs.  Improvement in the labour market In the wakeof the crisis, employment fell byalmost 1% in 2009, pushing the unemployment rate up to almost 5% (from around 4% a yearearlier). Short-time work and extended training inparticular helped reinin job losses that otherwise would have been more severe inview of the scaleof the contraction in activity. More recently, labour market developments surprisedon the positive side, especially in comparison to other euro-areacountries. Annual employment growth resumed inMarch 2010. Despite labour supply growing inparallel, the unemployment rate has been decliningsteadily. With 4.3% inAugust 2010, Austriaregistered the lowest unemployment rate in the EU.

One factor adding uncertaintyto the forecast is that foreign labour supply may rise with the expiry in2011of the seven-year-longtransition period during which access by citizens of the new EU Member States to the Austrian labour market was restricted. However, there areconflicting views as to what impact this changewould have.Fiscal consolidation helped by business cycle The general government deficit rose to 3½% ofGDP in2009, as a result of the free operation ofautomatic stabilisers and the stimulus packages adoptedby the Austrian authorities (in the context of the European Economy Recovery Plan). In2010, the deficit is set to widen further, risingabove 4% ofGDP, mainlydue to discretionarymeasures. Inparticular, parts of the 2009 taxreform, namely relief for families with children and tax cuts for the self-employed, came into force only in 2010 and are expected to burden the budgetby about ¼% of GDP. The accelerated depreciationprovision, adopted in January 2009, will alsoweigh somewhat on the budget in2010.  Fiscal consolidation, facilitated by the favourable economic developments, is set to begin in2011, and is projected to result in a narrowing of the deficit to around 3.6% ofGDP in2011 and3.3%in 2012. At the end of October2010, the government coalition partners came to an agreement on the measures to be introduced in order tobring Austrian public finances back ona sustainable path. The agreedconsolidationpackage, involving both revenue and expendituremeasures, is scheduled to be approved by theParliament towards the endof the year.  The biggest item in the above-mentionedconsolidation package on the revenue side isa bank levy (0.2% of GDP), designed in responseto the latest global financial crisis and intended tocollect a contributionfrom financial institutionstothe costs of stabilising the financial sector borne by the Austrian authorities. Its effect will bemitigated, however, bythewithdrawal ofa fee onloans. Another substantial element in the package is a rise in the fuel tax and in the taxon cigarettes (combined effect of around 0.2% of GDP). Apartfrom this, the set of agreed measures comprises inter alia: introductionof a tax on airline tickets, a rise in the tax on property sales by private foundations, an increase in registration feesfor less 123 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Table II.19.1:Main featuresof country forecast - AUSTRIA2009Annual percentagechangebn EURCurr. prices% GDP92-05200720082009201020112012 GDP 274.3100.02.23.72.2-3.92.01.72.1 Private consumption149.054.31.70.70.51.30.90.80.9 Publicconsumption54.619.92.02.14.00.40.80.00.5Gross fixed capital formation58.021.11.43.94.1-8.8-2.62.72.9 of which :  equipment22.08.01.56.67.5-14.5-2.34.75.3 Exports (goodsand services)138.650.56.18.61.0-16.19.06.36.5 Imports (goods and services)126.246.05.07.0-0.9-14.46.45.65.5GNI (GDP deflator)271.498.92.23.62.0-3.61.91.72.1Contribution to GDP growth :Domestic demand1.71.61.8-1.10.11.01.2Inventories0.00.7-0.6-1.00.30.00.0Net exports0.51.31.1-1.81.60.70.9 Employment0.51.51.6-1.60.70.70.8 Unemployment rate(a)4.24.43.84.84.44.24.0Compensation of employees/f.t.e.2.73.03.22.31.62.22.1 Unitlabourcosts whole economy0.90.82.74.80.31.20.8Real unit labour costs-0.6-1.20.83.9-0.3-0.4-0.5Savingsrate of households (b)--16.516.016.115.715.9 GDP deflator1.62.11.90.80.61.61.3 Harmonised index of consumer prices1.92.23.20.41.72.11.8Terms of trade of goods-0.1-0.5-2.12.1-2.1-0.2-0.3 Trade balance(c)-2.20.4-0.2-0.8-0.4-0.30.1 Current-account balance (c)-0.54.03.72.63.03.54.1 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-)vis-à-vis ROW(c)-0.64.13.72.73.03.54.1General government balance (c)-2.6-0.4-0.5-3.5-4.3-3.6-3.3Cyclically-adjusted budget balance(c)-2.5-1.6-1.8-2.3-3.4-2.9-2.9Structural budget balance (c)--1.6-1.8-2.3-3.4-2.9-2.9General government gross debt (c)64.759.362.567.570.472.073.3(a)Eurostat definition(b) gross saving divided bygross disposable income (c) as a percentageofGDPNote:Contributions to GDP growth may notadd up due tostatistical discrepancies.124 environment-friendly vehicles, the total effect ofwhich should have only a modest budgetaryimpact. There are still some remaining items fromthe 2008/09 stimulus package operating in 2011(e.g. accelerated depreciation provision), but their combined effect is forecast to be less than 0.1% of GDP. Whereas the measures on the revenue side of theconsolidation package are well defined,there is still some uncertainty as to what measures will betaken onthe expenditure side. This forecast is based on the assumption that the package willmainly contain cuts in family allowances(equivalent to about 0.1% of GDP) and pensionentitlements (0.1% of GDP) as well as somesaving in the area of long-term care (less than 0.1% of GDP).The effect of these expenditure measures willcoincide witha drop in spendingon labour market relief as the short-time work scheme is being phased out (0.1% of GDP). However,the consolidation effort will partly be offset byadditional spending on education, R&D and energy-saving renovation of buildings (0.1% of GDP) agreedby the government coalitionpartners in  the  consolidation   package.  Nevertheless,   the  general government deficitfigures for 2011 and2012 might turn out lower, should the package to be adoptedby the Parliament in December 2010 contain more consolidation measures on theexpenditure side.  Gross government debt went up by 5 pps. in 2009,reaching 67.5% of GDP. Apart from the increasein the deficit and the decline in GDP growth, a significant stock-flow adjustment, primarilyreflecting bank-rescue operations, contributed tothe rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Throughout the forecast period, the debt ratio is projected to risecontinuously, from almost 70.5% ofGDP in2010 to over73% of GDP in2012. Risks and uncertainties in the short-term outlook mainly derivefrom external developments, notably the pace of the recovery in Austria's major trading partners, the euro exchange rate and oil prices.From the domestic side, further positive surprises from business conditions and the labourmarketmay lead to mutually reinforcing stronger consumption and investment possibly adding toprice pressure. On the other hand, any adverse(external) shock may be amplified bydomestic fiscal restraint weighing on private sectorconfidence and spending. 20. POLAND Restrained rebound turns into solid, domestic-demand driven recovery 125 Moderate recovery as some growth factorspeter out In the crisis year 2009, Poland was the only country in the EU to record positive growth(1.7%). The rebound after the crisis has however been much less pronounced than inother MemberStates with the rate of growth picking up by 1.8 pps. between 2009 and 2010. The subdued rebound is the mirror image of the strongperformance seen in 2009. In particular, the low degree of openness to trade, which shielded Poland from the effects of the slump in external trade in2009, now limits the effects of the brisk rebound in international trade. Fiscal stimulusmeasures, which supported growth during the crisis, are being replaced by fiscal retrenchment in view of the deteriorating fiscal position.  Last but not least,improved market sentiment has led to the appreciation of the Polish currency and much moreimport-rich growth, contrasting with the sharp depreciation and import contraction of 2009.In the firsthalfof 2010, realGDP grew by3.3%y-o-y, increasingly driven by private consumption and restocking. After a sharp drop in the firstquarter of 2010, investment rebounded, stronglysupportedby a sizeable inflow of EU funds,increasing capacity utilisation levels and improvedprofitability, despite constrained credit supply. Improving labour market prospects underpinned private consumption. Rebounding external demand fuelled the domesticmanufacturing sector andstrengthened the turnaround in the inventories cycle.  The overall contribution ofnet exports togrowth was, however, neutral as the appreciating currency resulted in accelerating import demand. Overall, real GDP is expected to increase by 3.5%in 2010.  Continued improvement in 2011 and 2012 onthe back of strengthening domestic demand  The recovery is expected to strengthen further in 2011 and2012. Real GDP is projected to increase by 3.9% in 2011 and 4.2% in 2012. The maindrivers of this recovery are: a gradually improving labour market, rebounding consumer and businessconfidence, and increasedforeign capital inflows.  Public investment is set to accelerate further asseveral infrastructure projects are expected to be finalised before the Euro 2012 footballchampionships. Government plans to consolidate public finances by cutting investment will however curb the investment growth rate.  Private grossfixed capital formation is forecast to speed up considerably in 2011 after two years of sluggishgrowth. In particular, the corporate sector is set toinvest again, as capacity utilisation reachlong-term averages, large and medium sized companies hoard cash and there are tentative signsof credit supply pickingup in the low costenvironment. Real disposable income and consumptionwill benefit from the improvingsituation of the labour market and returning consumer confidence, though the increase in indirect taxes will somewhat limit this positive impact. Overall, private consumption growthwill gradually increase overthe forecast horizon, though it will remain below pre-crisis levels.  The impact of external trade on growth is likely tobe slightly negative, as accelerating domesticdemand may stimulate imports, outweighing the effects ofongoing strongexport growth. -4-2024

further acceleration in private investment on the 
back of projected loosen
ing of credit conditions.  
The current-account defic
it, which temporarily 
tightened to 1.9% of GDP in 2009, is expected to 
widen again to 3.7% of GDP over the forecast 
horizon. It reflects in 
particular the projected 
rebound in domestic demand and transfers due to 
improved profitability of foreign-owned 

companies.  
This scenario is subject to broadly-balanced upside 
and downside risks. On the upside, a stronger 
rebound in global demand and risk appetite would 
boost exports and investments. On the downside, 
a delayed loosening of credit conditions could 

hamper investment and consumption in the 

quarters ahead. In addition, delayed consolidation 

of public finances could affect market sentiment 

adversely, and increase th
e costs of borrowing for 
the private sector also.   
Inflation gradually picks up in the medium term  The effects of the depreciating domestic currency 

petered out and the rate of HICP inflation 

decreased from 4% in 2009 to below 2% by 

mid-2010. It is expected to rebound moderately 

exceeding 2½% towards end of 2010, fuelled by 

elevated food and energy prices. In 2011 it is 
forecast to grow further to 2.9%, reflecting 
developments in non-core components of the index 
and a rise in administered prices and indirect taxes.  
The rapid slowdown in wage growth in 2009, 
despite relatively modest productivity increases, 

resulted in limited ULC rises during the crisis. 
Going forward, labour productivity is expected to 
increase stronger over th
e forecast period, while 
wage growth in 2010 and 2011 will remain 
subdued, not least due to 
a freeze in public sector wages, curbing ULC growth until 2011. However, 

a limited supply of labour in the outer year of the 
forecast horizon and cont
ained wage pressure 
during the crisis are expected to result in an 
accelerating wage growth in the private sector in 

2012, which is likely to fuel core inflation and 

affect unit labour costs.  
Increasing unemployment masks resilient labour market performance  After 6 years of continuous decline, the 2009 crisis 
resulted in only a moderate rise in the 

unemployment rate, amid increasing labour supply 
benefiting inter alia from recent structural reforms. 

The sharper-than-an
ticipated downward 

adjustment of real wages 
mitigated the effects of 
the downturn on employment. Thus, employment 
kept growing during the crisis (by 0.5% between 
the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 
2010), especially in the 
services sector (except 

transportation), while manufacturing and 

agriculture experienced substantial falls in 

employment.  
Overall, employment growth is expected to remain 
in positive territory (0.7%) in 2010. Hiring is 
muted due to the effect of labour hoarding during 

the crisis. Increasing labour market participation 

will result in unemployment peaking at 9.5% 

in 2010.  
Going forward, employment growth is projected to 
accelerate gradually, leading to a moderate 
decrease in the unemployment rate to 8.5% 
in 2012. Against this improved outlook and 

mounting demographic pressures, further reforms 
favouring dynamic employment creation and 
higher labour market participation focusing on the 
extreme ends of the age distribution would help 

sustain a permanent recovery of domestic demand 

without undermining the competitiveness of the 

economy. 
Slow consolidation of public finances The Polish public finances have deteriorated 

considerably during the economic and financial 

crisis which hit Poland in 2008-09. A substantial 

stimulus package helped Poland to stay on 

a growth track; however,
 it resulted in a sizeable 
increase in the headline deficit from 3.7% in 2008 
to 7.2% of GDP in 2009. In 2010, despite higher 
than projected growth and a few consolidation 
measures, the headline deficit is expected to reach 
almost 8% of GDP. This further deterioration can 
be explained mainly by lower revenues from 
Corporate Income Tax (due to the authorisation to 
carry over the losses accumu
lated during the crisis 
to the subsequent years), higher consumption and 
investment expenditure by local government 

entities and higher interest expenditure.  
In 2011, the headline deficit relative to GDP is 
expected to fall by around 1
 pps. This 
improvement is due to consolidation measures 
enacted by the government
 which are expected to 
amount to about 1% of GDP. It also benefits from 

a positive growth outlook. The revenue ratio is 
126 Member States, Poland forecast to increase, drivenby the strong growth intax revenues(a 1 pp. VAT rate increase and rebound in income taxes drivenby furtheracceleration in GDP growth and stronger public investment). The expenditure ratio is set to drop,mainly due to a nominal freeze in public sector wages (with the exception of teachers) and a relatively slow increase in social transfers, related to an expected improvement in labour market situation.A further deficit reduction of about ½ pp. isforecast for 2012. Under the no-policy change scenario the deficit forecastmainly improves on the back of close-to-potential GDP growth. Further increases in tax revenues and social contributionsare expected to be accompanied by a considerable slowdown in public investment expendituregrowth and limited growthin social transfers.Given a small negative output gap, the structuraldeficit does not deviate considerably from theheadline deficit and is relatively high incomparison to other EU Member States.

PORTUGAL Fiscal consolidation and private sector deleveraging 128 In the spotlight of sovereign debt markets  In the first half of 2010, the economy recovered,following a severe recession that hit the country during the global economicand financial crisis. This growthspurt was due to a strong turnaround in domestic demand, inparticular private and public consumption, and mildly positive contributions from external trade. Privateconsumption arguably benefited fromlow interestrates and anticipatory effects of the VAT rateincrease, which has taken effect on1 July 2010. Positive growth rates in the first half of the year merely sloweddown the shedding ofjobs, asinvestment activity remained subdued. With the continued weakness of the labour market, unemployment became more entrenched.  The recession, the subsequent deterioration inlabour market conditions, and the halt in fiscal consolidation attempts observed up to early 2008 have taken a heavy toll on public finances. Thisspring, Portugal along with some other Member States came under increased scrutiny from sovereign debt markets, and increases ingovernment bond yields put additional pressure onpublic finances. In an attempt to alleviate thispressure, the Portuguese authorities announced fiscal plans inMay and September that weremore ambitious than those set out in the March 2010Stability Programme, with the new fiscal targets being underpinned by consolidation measures, partof which implemented in mid 2010.  The underlying growth trend remains weak The intensified fiscal consolidation, whilehavingan important impact on raising confidence levelsand lowering yield spreads,shapes the short-term outlookforeconomic growth through theirimmediate impact on private and public consumption expenditure. Atthe same time, a highlevel of private sector indebtedness will force households and companies to undertake balance sheet corrections. In order to attenuate the high external indebtedness, economic activity needs to be rebalanced by strengthening exports and investment activity and restraining public andprivate consumption. Fiscal consolidation shapes short-term outlook Real GDP is expected to increase by 1¼% in 2010and todecline by about 1% in 2011. In 2012, GDP is forecast to recover at a rate of ¾%. The growthpattern in 2010 is shapedby the strong activityrecorded in the first half of this year and the expected subsequent drop in GDP in the secondsemester due to the impact of the VAT hike and cuts in social transfers that came into effect in July. Fiscal consolidation will continue to weighonprivate consumption once the new fiscal measures come into effect in January. In addition,private households are expected to continue their balance sheet repairamidst a subdued labour marketoutlook and tightened financial conditions. As a consequence, private consumption is expected todecrease substantially in both 2011 and2012. Graph II.21.1:Portugal - GDP growth andcontributions-4-3-2-1012

In 2011, real government consumption is forecast to fall by about 6¾% in 2011 and by a further 1¼% in 2012. Gross fixed capital formation is projected to continue its longstandingdownward trenduntil the endof 2011, weighed down byweak domestic demand and deleveraging by the corporate sector.A mildrecovery in machinery and equipment investment and business construction is, however, expectedfor 2012 as accelerating exports are likely torequire additionalproduction capacity. Housing investment, in contrast, should continue todecline during the forecast period. Member States, PortugalStronger exports in line with the expected recoveryin Portugal's export markets and a deceleration inimportsdue tothe contraction indomestic demandshould lead tosignificant reductions of the deficits in the trade and current-account balances. Servicing external liabilities will continue to absorb a significant share of income over themedium-term, mirrored in the deficit in theprimary income balance, which is expected to increase from3½% of GDP in recent years to 4%of GDP in2012. As a result, the gap between grossdomestic product and gross national income shouldcontinue towiden. Labour market conditions weigh on wagegrowth– Unemployment recorded a sharp increase when theeconomic and financial crisis unfolded at the end of 2008and has since become entrenched with more than half of the unemployed now being outofworkfor longer than one year. At the same time,the NAIRU has increased torecord levels. Labour market conditions are expected to improve onlytowards the end of 2012, on the back of therecovery in private investment activity.Employment is forecast todecrease in each year between 2010 and 2012. Against this background and in the wake of a reduction innominal publicsector wages, private sector wage growth isexpectedto be moderate in the forecast period, thereby containingunit labour costs and improving price competitiveness.  –and dampen price developments HICP headline inflationreached 2% y-o-y in September 2010, partly as a result of the VAT hikein July. A further increase is to be expected when another VAT increase comes into effect at the beginning of 2011. HICP is forecast to increase by 1½% in 2010 and to further accelerate to 2¼% in 2011, before it falls back in2012. After a strongincrease in 2009, unit labour costs are expected to stagnate or even slightly decline in the forecastperiod. There are upside and downside risks to the forecast. On the positive side, an earlier-than-expected improvement of labour market conditionscould mitigate the contractionary short-termimpact of the fiscal consolidation and triggera faster recovery ofdomestic demand. On thenegative side, anyunfavourabledevelopment would notonly put public finances at immediate risk, but higher riskpremia on the bondmarket could also raise the funding costs of domesticbanks and negatively impact on the provision ofcredit to the private sector.  Challenge of fiscal consolidation in a low GDPgrowth environment In 2010, the government deficit is expected tobe7.3% of GDP, downfrom 9.3% of GDP in 2009. The lower 2010 deficit outcomeis due to higherrevenue, reversing the sharp falls recorded in 2009.The revenue increase partly reflects somehousehold consumption buoyancy as well as discretionarymeasures taken in the middle of the year, especially a one percentage point increase in all VAT rates and, to a lesser extent, increases indirect taxes. In addition, the 2010 budgetary outcome will benefit from a one-off revenue item worth 1.5% of GDP, linked to the transfer ofa private pension fund to the government sector,which takes responsibility for the payment of futurepensions. This transaction reduces the 2010 deficit butis neutral in terms of fiscalsustainability insofar as the one-time payment to the government is the actuarial value of future pension payments.

Measures on the expenditure side include anaverage cut of 5% in government wages,reductions in government employment,cuts insocial transfers such as unemployment benefits and family allowances, and a freeze of essentially all other socialoutlays. Additional measures are targeted at reining in spending in a numberofother areas, including, for instance, the health sector, and transfers to state-owned enterprises orpublic investment. Consolidation efforts on therevenue side consist mainlyof an additional rise of 2 pps. in the standard VAT rate. In addition,revenue proceeds will reflect the carry-over effect of the tax hikes of mid-2010. In all, with such a large fiscal consolidationeffort, the 2011 deficitmay cometo under 5% of GDP,also taking into account the fact that the fading of the large one-off revenue recorded in2010 willlimit the deficit reduction in 2011. The currentfiscal outlook hinges, on the one hand, upon the assumption that the ambitious expenditure plans outlined in the 2011 Budget Law will largelymaterialise and, on the other hand, upon a GDPoutlookwhich is only mildlymore subdued than the contraction of0.7% underlying the taxprojectionsof the  2011  Budget.  Thus, there are risks to this fiscal scenario. Notably, should the macroeconomic outlook turnout to be bleaker thancurrently expected, fiscal prospects will beaffected by lower tax revenues. Indeed, given theuncertainty on a number of external and financialvariables, it cannotbe excluded that the evolution of demand stays below the present scenario. Based onunchanged policies, the governmentdeficit is expected to remain essentially constant in2012. Revenue is expected to continue tobeaffected by the weak economic momentum, while expenditure is projected to grow in excess ofsluggish nominal GDP. In particular, interestspending isexpected to increase rapidly. Measuresput in place in earlier years to rein in spending areexpected to work towards expenditure containment, but they will not yield a marked fall in the primary-spending-to-GDP ratio in a context of rather low nominal GDP growth.  Government debt is projected to attain 92% of GDP in 2012, up from 83% of GDP in2010. Therisingdebt levels should lead to a rapid increase ininterest spending, which is expected tobe the fastest-growing spending item and a major factorhindering improvements in the government balance in the coming years. 22. ROMANIA Economy not out of the woods yet 131 Domestic demand prolongs the recession After a major slump in economic growth in 2009(-7.1%), the Romanian economy remains mired byweakdomestic demand in 2010. The longdurationof the recessionaryperiod is mainly due to theunsustainabledevelopments in the economy beforethe international crisis. The economic boom in the pre-crisis period Œ with real GDP growthaveraging 6.8% in 2004-08 Œ was underpinned bystrong domestic demand. The latter was fuelled bya pro-cyclical policy ofgenerous increases in public wages and pensions, and also by banklending, most of which was in foreign currency. As a result, Romania entered the recession with a budget deficit of 5.7% of GDP anda current-accountdeficitof 11.4%. This vulnerable position created additional stress in local financial markets and limited the scope for anygovernmentstimulus topropup the economy. With the onset of the crisis, Romania asked for medium-term financial assistance in the form of amultilateral loan package totalling EUR 20 bnfromthe EU, the IMF, the World Bank, the EIBand the EBRD. This assistance is still ongoing andloan disbursements are conditional onimplementing an adjustment programme whichaims to bring down the budgetdeficit, promote structural reforms and restore stability in financial markets. The key economic reforms include a new pension system, a unified wage law for theemployees in the budgetary sector and a fiscalresponsibility law to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances. Thanksto theprogramme, pressures on the exchange rate havebeen reduced, financial stress has eased,and the international reserves position has improved.Industrial activity decoupled from weakdomestic environment Real GDPgrowth is expected to decline by 1.9%in 2010, mainly due to faltering domestic demand.Private consumption recovered somewhat in the second quarter, but fell again after the increase in the standardVAT rate, cuts in public wages andlayoffs in the budgetary sector. Retail sales haveplummeted and consumer sentiment now stands athistorically low levels. Government spending is also falling inorder tokeep in line with the targets agreed in the context of the multilateral assistanceprogramme. Investment spending has beenhard hitby the political uncertainty and the still highriskpremia associated with the country and the region.This is likely to have an impact on the rate ofpotential growth of the economy in the short-term as its productive capacity has beenreduced and will take some time to recover. On the other hand, industrial activity is benefittingstrongly from therecovery in the main tradingpartners, and seems tobe sheltered fromthe weak domestic environment.Exports increased robustly in the first half of this year, with importsrising in tandem but at a slowerrate. The current-accountdeficit is projected to deteriorate somewhat this year to5.5% of nominal GDP, from 4.5% in2009, primarily due to lower workers' remittances. Still, this ratio represents a substantial improvement from the double-digitrates recordedin 2006-08. -20-15-10-5051015200506070809101112pps.Domestic demandNet exportsGDP growth(y-o-y%)Graph II.22.1:Romania - GDP growth and contributionsforecastThe economy is expected toturn around in 2011, with real GDP forecast toincrease by 1.5%. After falling severely in 2009 and 2010, investment shouldpick upbya vigorous 4.2% andisexpectedto be a main driver ofgrowth as companies re-adjust their production lines to meet the increased external demand. Exports have maintained their strong momentumthroughout 2010, and, togetherwith the jump in industrial orders, this development is expected to reassure companies,even if risk spreads remain somewhat elevated. Moreover, increased absorption of substantial EU funds would provide a fillip for infrastructure investment. After having declined considerably in2009 (-10.6%) and 2010(projected to decline by 1.6%), household consumption will pick-up marginally next year by 1.8%, as wages re-adjustupwards. It will however be suppressedby the European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
continuing fiscal retrenchment and the high debt-
service-to-income ratio, which is also leading to 

high non-performing loans (ratio close to 12% as 

at September). After having an overall positive 

impact in 2009 and 2010, 
net exports are expected to make a negative contribution to growth next 
year as imported capital goods increase, feeding 
into investment growth. As Romanians living 
abroad benefit from improving labour market 
conditions abroad, workers' remittances should 
pick up again in 2011. 
The current-account deficit 
is projected to stabilise at 5.6% of GDP. 
The economy is then expected to close the output 
gap faster in 2012, as it grows by 3.8%, above its 
medium-term potential growth rate of around 3%. 
By then, wages are proj
ected to accelerate from 
their very low levels (compared to its main trading 

partners), especially in the industrial and 
professional sectors. This development will in turn 
have a positive impact on restoring household 

balance sheets and will lead to a higher growth rate 

in private consumption. Growth will thus be more 

broad-based, with domestic demand again playing 

a decisive role in uplifting the economy. 

Government consumption will however remain 

subdued as the government is expected to continue 

with fiscal consolidation.   
Higher unemployment and declining wages– The protracted economic 
recession led to higher 
unemployment in 2010 and a substantial correction 

in wage growth. The unemployment rate has been 

declining somewhat since the second quarter, but 

most of this could be statistical, as those who lose 

their unemployment benefit do not seem to have an 
incentive to register fo
r work. The unemployment 
rate is projected to averag
e 7.4% in 2010, up from 
6.8% last year, and then to diminish slowly in 
2011-12. The recovery in total employment will be 
delayed Œ employment growth is expected to be 
negligible in 2011, after negative growth this year 
Œ due to the lack of flexibility in the labour market 
and also because of further layoffs in the public 

sector. Improving labour market legislation 

remains a key challenge as the country grapples 

with its huge informal economy, low employment 

and activity rates, and strong emigration. In the 
meantime, growth in average gross monthly 
earnings went into negative territory in the third 
quarter after the 25% cut in public wages, but are 
expected to increase as fro
m next year as layoffs 
will leave some space for upward wage adjustment 

in the public sector. 
–while inflation increased on the back of the 
VAT increase The purchasing power of households has been hit 
not only by the reduction in gross wages, but also 

by elevated levels of inflation. The declining trend 

in inflation since mid-2008 was halted by the 5pps 

increase in the main VAT rate in July. VAT and 

higher food prices will push CPI inflation towards 
8% by year-end, compared to 4.6% last year. In 
view of these inflationary pressures, the National 
Bank of Romania maintained its policy rate at 
6.25% since May 2010. Annual inflation is 
projected to be within the central bank's targeted 
tolerance band of 3% +/-1 pp. in end-2011 and 
throughout 2012. 
Fiscal consolidation to continue, but substantial 
risks of reversing measures remain The fiscal situation deterior
ated further in the first 
months of 2010, due mostly to substantial revenue 
underperformance. During the multilateral 

financial assistance review in May 2010 it 

appeared that the 2010 deficit target of 6.4% of 

GDP would be missed by around 3 pps. of GDP 
under unchanged policies. The 2010 government 
deficit target was revised upward to 7.3% of GDP 
to accommodate for a deterioration in economic 
conditions. To reach the revised target, the 
authorities took additional consolidation measures 
including a temporary 25% reduction in public 
wages, a 15% reduction in social spending 
excluding pensions and an increase in the main 

VAT rate from 19% to 24%. In addition, the 

authorities decided to cut spending on goods and 

services by 10% and early retirements were frozen 

from 1 June 2010 until after the pension reform is 
in effect (1 Janu
ary 2011). Social contributions and 
personal income tax bases were broadened and the 

authorities also committed to further reduce 
personnel in the last part of the year, on top of cuts 

in the first half of 2010 exceeding 25000 jobs. The 

fiscal consolidation measures have put Romania on 
track to achieve the defic
it target of 7.3% of GDP 
for 2010. However, Romania continues to be 
plagued by recurring arrears, particularly in the 

health sector. Despite the fact that 2 billion RON 

were given to the sector to pay back arrears in 

September, trends would suggest a new build-up of 

arrears at the end of the 
year due to structural 
problems (the health fund can make expenditure 
commitments exceeding its budget which 
translates into arrears). The authorities have 
reallocated funds within th
e budget to pay the new 
accumulated arrears and would use any budget

Theyhave alsoagreed to measures within the multilateral financialassistance programme to prevent a further accumulation of arrears in the health sector in thefuture. The 2011 budget deficit is forecast to decrease further to4.9% of GDP given the carry-over fromthe 2010 fiscal consolidation measures and the additional savingson the expenditure sidedecided by the authorities. The latter include a reduction in energy subsidies, a freeze in pensions in nominal terms, a further reduction in public employment bycontinuing toapply the policy of only replacing1 of 7 departing workers, implementation offurther health-sector reforms, andanimprovement in revenue and expenditure controls. For 2012,under the no-policy-change assumption, the budgetdeficit is forecast todecrease to 3.5% ofGDP.  While the forecast assumes that the authorities donot reverse the fiscal consolidation measures taken in July 2010there are substantial risks that can endanger the fiscal consolidation path. In particular, there is heavy pressure on theauthorities to reverse the fiscal consolidationmeasures implemented in July 2010 and to revertto policies ofunsustainable spending. While this may provide some short-term stimulus in terms of domestic demand, it will come at a cost ofseverely reduced growth potential inthe medium- to long-run. 23.

Faster growthisalso beinghamperedby the tight credit conditionsin the indebted corporate sector and slow adjustment inthe construction sector, which may take until late2011or 2012 to complete. A moderate rebound Slovenia has seen real GDP fall more abruptly and for longer than fellow euro-area countries. Bymid2010, six consecutive quarters of economicturbulence left real GDP around 9% below thepeak reached in the third quarterof2008. In2009, gross capital formation was the biggest contributorto negative growth, as both construction andinvestment in equipmentwent into freefall. Pronounced destocking throughout the year alsodraggedgrowth down. Despite declining trade, a smaller fall in merchandise exports compared toimports helped to attenuate the recession.

While the drag on growth from private consumption has persisted, destocking has given way to renewedinventoryaccumulation. The strengthening pullfrom external demand belatedly brought the recovery to life in the secondquarter of2010, when real GDP grew by 1.1% q-o-q. Merchandiseexports, particularly to the EU, are the engine of growthhere, while the trade surplus in services has in factnarrowed.  Graph II.23.2:Slovenia - Breakdown ofinvestment-30-20-1001020300506070809101112y-o-y%Non-residential constructionDwellingsConstructionEquipmentforecastExtrapolating these trends, net exports are expected to contribute 1.2 pps. to real GDP growthin 2010, while gross fixedcapital formation and household consumption continue to subtract fromgrowth. Underlying these figures onthe supplyside, there is a healthy recovery in high and medium-technology manufacturing and certainservices, undercut by a continuing decline inthe construction sector, particularly inresidential housing. These trends are, overall, likely tocontribute to the improvement in the trade balance in 2011-12.  Domestic demand is expected to contribute 1 pp.to real GDPgrowth in 2011, as revived private consumption and equipmentinvestment outweighthe drag from construction and publicconsumption. As private consumption strengthens in 2012, the contribution of domestic demand is projected torise further. Uncertain prospects in the construction sector  Notwithstanding efforts to increase exports of construction services, the highly indebted construction sector, notably civilengineeringand housing, is likely to account for a significantlyreduced share of GVA in Slovenia's post-crisiseconomy. The onset of the crisis coincided withthe end of major civil engineering projects, notablyhighways, while housing construction underwenta sustained decline in the secondhalf of 2009 and has yet tobottom out. The number of new Member States, Slovenia 
dwellings sold is down by half while the 
corresponding prices remain far closer to their 

peak. Under current market conditions, indebted 

construction firms would only be able to sell their 

stocks of finished housing units by adjusting 

prices, so they prefer 
to await a rebound in 
demand. Banks appear to be facilitating this 
situation by allowing loans to roll over rather than 
forcing further price adjust
ments to take place. In 
this context, orderly deleveraging is not a foregone 

conclusion.    
Slovenia's net borrowing is set to decline further, 
from 1.3% of GDP in 2009 to 0.7% in 2010, as 
a result of some continued balance sheet repair in 
the corporate sector, im
proved absorption of EU 
funds and low interest rates. Except for the latter, 

these trends are forecast to be stable over 2011 and 
2012, sustained by the minor improvement in the 
external balance of goods and services. Household 
finances are expected to remain sound, due to low 

indebtedness and traditionally high saving rates.  
Inflation, which declined markedly over 2009, is 
running at a higher rate in 2010, largely due to 

successive hikes of excise duty rates on energy 

products, alcohol and tobacco, and high prices in 
utilities services. These temporary factors, which 
should fall out of the cal
culation in 2011, account 
for most of the inflation differential vis-à-vis the 
euro-area average in
 2010. In 2011-12, the reversal 
of price falls in non-energy industrial goods and 

gradually increasing cost-pressures in the service 

sector are expected to sustain HICP around 2%. 
A flat labour market Considering the severity of the output shock, 

employment has remained rather resilient during 

the recession, with labour productivity taking 

a large part of the adjustment. Subsidies for 

temporary lay-offs and reduced working hours 

were a supportive factor. These are expiring but 
adverse effects are expected to be contained as the 
number of beneficiaries has already declined 
substantially. Furthermore, the labour market has, 
according to early indicatio
ns, adapted well to the 
2010 minimum wage increase, which applied to 

fewer people than initially expected due to earlier 
job losses in the relevant wage bracket. 
Employment fell in the first half of the year, albeit 
at a diminishing rate, and further slight declines in 
the second half of the year can be expected due to 
continued difficulties in construction and some 
bankruptcies, leaving employment for 2010 as 
a whole lower than in 2009.  
As regards the projected employment dynamics in 
2011-12, the upturn is expected to mirror the 
downturn, in that increased output will initially 

raise labour productivity, with employment growth 

occurring with a considerable lag. Moreover, 
ongoing employment losses in construction, many 
of them affecting foreign workers, are unlikely to 
be completely reversed if, as expected, the sector's 

share in gross value added settles at a more 

sustainable level. 
Wage growth in 2010 is forecast to be somewhat 
higher than might be expected at the current stage 
of the cycle, due to th
e minimum wage increase, 
the continuing composition effects from job losses 
in low paid sectors and occupations, and higher 

wages for employees returning to work or full 

hours after a spell on one of the wage subsidy 

schemes. As these temporary factors recede, wages 
are expected to moderate somewhat in 2011, 
before picking up again in 2012 as the economic 
recovery gathers pace. Wage increases will be 
concentrated in the priv
ate sector due to the 
planned restraint in the public sector. After edging 
downwards in 2010, unit la
bour costs are expected to rebound as wages growth overtakes productivity 

growth in 2011.  
This baseline scenario could prove optimistic or 
pessimistic depending on the strength of foreign 

demand, particularly in the EU. Similarly, the 
gathering pace of domestic recovery over the 
forecast horizon is contingent on the construction 
sector completing its adjustment. Significant 

economic dislocation and financial contagion 
could emerge if the orderly unwinding of high 
corporate debts, not least in the construction 

sector, cannot be accomplished. 
From containment to consolidation For 2010, the government has adopted measures to 

restrain primary expenditure growth, confirming 

its intention to pursue an expenditure-based fiscal 

consolidation. These measures include an agreed 

postponement of public sector wage increases and 

a halving of the usual indexation of social benefit 
rates, including pensions. Last June, in light of 
worsening economic and budgetary developments 
since the adoption of the budget, the government 
adopted additional consolidation measures in

The general governmentdeficit is estimatedtostabilise at around5.8%of GDP in2010. This exceeds the national target of 5.6%, largely because of lower projected growth in indirect taxes. The primary balance is expected to improveby ¼% ofGDP. Revenues are expected to be boosted by higher excise duties and current and capital transfers while expenditure is drivenhigher mainly by growth in intermediate consumption andthe number of recipients of social transfers Œ particularly new pensioners in anticipationof the pension reform. These developments drive up boththe revenue and expenditure ratios in2010.For 2011, public sector wage restraint willcontinue, with, in addition, a freeze on promotions and less generous wage indexation. Indexation of social transfer rates, includingpensions, will be further reduced. Nevertheless, the projectedreduction of the general government deficit to5.3% of GDP is somewhat less than that planned by the government (4.8% of GDP). In addition tothe lower starting base for indirect taxes from2010, the Commission services™ forecast incorporates the expectation that public employment will be reducedby less than the extentplanned and that departures into retirement will continue above trend until the pension reform enters intoforce. In 2012, increased domestic demand is expected tosupport revenue growth, while on the expenditureside, this forecast does not take account of the announcedbut not yet adopted consolidation measures, due to the usual no-policy-changeassumption. Notably, any prolongation of thefreeze in promotions to 2012 is still to be agreedand the less generous indexation in public wagesand social transfer rates, including pensions,currently only applies until 2011.  The gross government debt ratio is expected to riseto 40.7% of GDP in 2010, up from 35.4% in 2009, drivenby the primary deficit and the increasinginterest burden. The debt ratio is projected to growfurther, reaching 47½% in2012, as a result ofpersisting primary deficits. The governmentexpects to finance the announced recapitalisation of the country's foremostbanking group and international obligations out of funds deposited with banks in 2009. As the deposits are already reflected in the government gross debt, these operations are not anticipated tofurther increase debt over the forecast horizon. 24. SLOVAKIA An externally-driven recovery137 Buoyant growth interrupted by the crisis Given its large degree ofopenness to, withexports representing over 80% of GDP in 2008, Slovakia was strongly exposed to the contraction in external demand in 2008 and 2009. At the same time, alsobecause of the extremely uncertain outlook at that time, investment plunged by 20%. Moreover, firms simultaneously reduced their inventories at an unprecedented pace, which acted as an "accelerator" of the contraction. As a result, real GDP fell by 4.8%.In order to sustain domestic demand and in linewith the European economic recovery plan, theSlovakgovernment let the automatic stabilisersoperate freely. It also adopted several anti-crisis measures totalling roughly ½% GDP in 2009.These policies helped to retainhousehold consumptiona slight positive growthin 2009. Despite the large shock to the real economy and severe stress in global financial markets, the Slovak banking sector has remained solid. Thisreflects the good liquidity situation of credit institutions and low dependence on cross-border lending. More subdued GDP growth following strongrebound in 2010 In 2010, real GDP is projected to increase by around 4%, followingan unexpectedly strongrebound in economic activity, especially inGermany, Slovakia's largest tradingpartner, in the first half of 2010. Economicgrowth is expected tobe more subdued in 2011, taking into accountconsolidation measures envisaged in the budget forthat year and the expected deceleration of Slovakia's main trading partners, returning again toan average annual rate close to4% in the final year of the forecast period. Given the rapidlydeteriorating labourmarket conditions in 2009-10, household consumption expenditure is expected to turnnegative in 2010,as suggested by continuouslydeteriorating consumer sentiment indicators over the lastmonths. For 2011, an increase of 1.5% is expected,reflecting improvements on the labour market combined withmore sustained growth inreal wages and a decline inhousehold saving rate. Onthe other hand, some of the implementedconsolidationmeasures, in particular the reduction of the wagebill in the public sector, will dampendisposable income of households,. After an unprecedented slump in 2009, investment growth is expected to return topositive territory as soon as 2010 (1.7%) given the need to replace fixed capital in the follow-up of the crisis, and tofurther accelerate to 5.1% in 2011. In the short term, the current low capacity utilisation and rather subdued industrial confidence will pose some drag on private investment growth. Nevertheless, forboth 2011 and 2012, it isassumed thata better drawing ofEU funds, together with a revival of highway projects and gradually improving global economic prospects, will have an overall positive impact on investment growth. Moreover, on theback of a sharppick-up in exports, for2010 and to a lesser extent 2011, strong re-stocking is assumed,following the drop in2009which contributed substantially to the contraction in real GDP.

15040506070809101112pps.Dom. demand, excl. invent.InventoriesNet exportsGDP (y-o-y%)forecastTurning to the external side, Slovakia is expectedto benefit from a rebound in externaldemand, fuelled in particularby the strong growth performance of the Germaneconomy in the firsthalf of 2010. With external conditions slightly worsening in 2011, both export and import growth are projectedto decelerate.Net trade is forecast to contribute togrowthby over ½ pp. this year and0.9 pp. onaverage in2011-12. One of the underlying assumptions is that Slovakia will also continue togain export market shares also in 2011-12, albeit at a slower pace than in 2010.  European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 The baseline scenario is subject to a number of risks. In particular, any unexpected developmentsin the pace of recovery in the country's maintrading partners might result in potentially large changes in export performance inboth directions. From the domestic demand side, a stronger-than-expected impact of consolidation measures for 2011 mighthave implications, especially for households' consumption expenditure. Persistent underperformance of the labour market After several years of above-potential economicgrowth, the unemployment rate in Slovakiadeclined significantly, but at its low point of 9.5%in 2008 it was still one of the highest in the EU.The reactionof the Slovak labour market to thedownturn in 2009 was strong and almostimmediate: the unemployment rate is now expected to reach about 14½% in 2010, despite improving economic conditions, which points tofragile labour demand fromthe private sector inthe aftermath of the crisis. The situation is expected toimprove progressively in2011, although fiscal austerity measures, inparticular cuts in the public sectorwage bill whichwill beimplemented partly via a reduction in the numberof public sector employees at the centralgovernment level, will weigh on the labour market, albeit marginally. More substantial improvement isforeseen in2012, coupledwith the general increase in economic activity. However, a number ofpersistent structuralproblems in the labourmarket, which has the highest rate oflong-termunemployed among all the EU Member States, andprofessional-skill mismatches, which led to significant labour shortages at the end of theprevious expansion, could hamper the adjustment. HICP inflation driven also by administrative changes in 2011 After years of modest increases in price levels, HICP inflation further decelerated in2009 to0.9%, following the economic downturn. Gradualeconomic recovery is set todrive inflation in 2010 only modestly, to around1%, also taking intoaccount the decrease in excise duties on diesel fuels implemented at the beginningof2010. In the following years, although the generally lowpressures stemming fromthe demand side andmoderate wage growth are projected to containprice pressures, increases in the VAT rate and excise taxes as part of the fiscal package will result in HICP inflation rising by3.2% in2011, whereascore inflation is expected to be rather subdued. Inflation in 2012 will decelerate as the effects of the administrative measures wear off, butwill besustained byimproving household consumption. Strong emphasis on the consolidation of publicfinances The vulnerable state of the public finances, causedby years of procyclical fiscal policies, whenstrongeconomic performance had been accompanied by an increasing structural deficit, has been fully revealed during the economic downturn. In 2009,when Slovakia's economic activity plunged by anunprecedented 4.8%, the general government deficitreached 7.9% of GDP.A drop intaxrevenues andfull operationof automatic stabilisers were the main reasons behind the significant deterioration. Nevertheless, other factors such asthe subsidising of loss-making companies and the inefficient healthcare sector also contributed to an increase in the headline deficit.  In view of the worsening state of the public finances, the government adopted the 2010 budget,which included several consolidation measures, focusingprincipally at the reductionof the generalgovernment expenditure on goods and services andcapital. However, given lower-than-projected revenues, higher-than-planned expenditure andunexpected events (e.g. floods), the deficit isprojected toremain high in2010 at 8.2% ofGDP.

The measures on the revenue side include hiking VATby 1 pp. to 20%, increases in excise taxes (i.e. beer, tobacco,etc.), broadening of bases forpersonal income tax and social contributions andextra non-tax revenues such as receipts from saleof emission allowance quotas and special fees of electricity distributors. Implementation ofthese measures isexpected to lead to a significant reduction in the general government deficit to5.3% of GDP in2011. Asso far nospecific measures have been announced for 2012, the deficit is projected toreach around 5% ofGDP under the no-policy-change assumption. While the general government debt is projected toremain at relatively low levels (42%, 45% and 47% of GDP in 2010, 2011 and2012respectively)the speed of the increase is non-negligible. A projected increase in thedebt-to-GDP ratio of almost 20 pps. in 2008-12 would be close to the reduction achieved in2000-08. Unsuccessfulconsolidationcould signify a further increase inpublic debt. In order to improve the budgeting process, thecurrentgovernment intends to introduce a number of changes to the existing fiscal framework. If thoroughly implemented, these measures (whichcould notably include binding expenditure ceilingsand better specification of rules for budgeting oflocal governments and itsmonitoring) couldsignificantly improve the quality of the budgetary framework and increase the credibility ofgovernment's budgetaryplans.25. FINLAND Strong domestic demand boosting recovery 140 Recovery gathering strength in 2010 While GDP declinedin 2009 by 8%, led bythe collapse of foreign demand,the economy hasgenerally preserved its solid fundamentals. The global crisis had a relatively small negative effect on the health of the Finnish financial sector, the labour market proved resilient and consumerconfidence recovered rapidly to levels evenexceeding the pre-crisis peak. The sizeable fiscal stimulus ofover3%of GDP extending over2009 and 2010 also boosted economic activity. GDP growthremained subdued in the first quarter of 2010 and was also affected by an exceptionallycoldwinter and a strike closing major Finnishseaports for several weeks. In contrast, GDP grewrapidly in the second quarter of the year on theback of a recovery in foreign trade and robustdomestic demand. The economic crisis only hada temporary disruptive effect on the real-estate market. Real-estate prices have already recovered to above pre-crisis levels and housing constructionis booming after a temporary drop during thecrisis. Compared with last year, investment inhousing shotup by about a third in the second quarter of 2010, having returnedtothe highlevelsof construction activity seenprior to the global crisis. Since the other main investment categories were still contracting in the secondquarter, the overall slight growth in investment was solelydriven byhousing. Graph II.25.1:Finland- Contributions toinvestment growth-15-10-50510150506070809101112pps.Residential housingNon-residential constructionEquipmentOtherforecastThe labour market has remained resilient in the face of longer-term effects from populationageing The crisishas had a more limited impacton thelabourmarket than was initially expected based onpast experiences. Annual average unemployment isforecast to peak at 8½% of the labour force in 2010, which is a 2 percentage point increase fromthe low-point in 2008. During the crisis in 2009, temporary lay-offs and various schemes to reduce working time were widely used, amounting toabout 2%of the labour force, which limited the increase in unemployment.In 2010, reduced working time arrangements have beenlargelyreversed, with the majority of the affected employees having moved back to full timeemployment. During the economic crisis, the activity rate of the labour force alsodeclined notably, as people increasingly opted for studies ordomestic work, when labour market conditionsdeteriorated. Finlandwill be one of the first Member States tobe affected by population ageing. Reflecting theretirement of a large baby-boom generation, the working age population is projected todecline byabout 140,000 people in 2010-20, representing over5%of the current labour force. Beyond 2020, this demographic shift will level off. The impacton the labour market will already becomeevident over the current forecast period. Labour shortages and wagepressures will probably increase in somesectors, even though unemployment would remainrelatively high due to existing labour market mismatches.  Strong recovery going forward, led bydomestic demand and exceptional growth inhousing investment Given that the economy has already gainedmomentum over the course of 2010, and forwardlooking indicators show strong consumer andbusiness confidence coupled with solid macroeconomic fundamentals, economic growth is expected to exceed the EU average over theforecast period. The difference with the EU average is forecast to narrow in 2012, as GDP growth inFinland moderates to rates closer topotential, which is suppressedby the adverse demographic trends.  Member States, Finland Past economic crisis episodes in Finland have beenfollowed by an export-led recovery. In contrast,the current recovery process will be morebalanced, with domestic demand growing fast aswell. While foreign trade has also rebounded in2010 from the exceptionally sharpdrop in2009(when export volumes declined by about 20%), the contribution togrowthfrom foreign trade is forecast to be broadly neutral over 2011-12, asbuoyantdomestic demand also drives rapid growthin imports. Apart fromthe global economic cycle,the main Finnish export industries (metalengineering, electronics, and forestry products) areaffectedby longer term global production shifts. The traditionally high share of industry in the Finnish economy and in employment has alreadybeen declining over the past decade, while that of services has increased. While the globalisation trends imply a shift in goods production to cheaperlocations, it is compensated for by higher value-added jobs remaining in Finland (headquarters, R&D, sales) which is recorded in foreign trade asservices exports. The current account is forecast to maintain a surplus position of about 1½% of GDP in 2010-12. During the acute phase of the economic crisis, consumers' purchasing power was strongly supported by tax cuts and by relatively generous wage increases settled by previous centralisedwage agreements. Nevertheless, the aggregate wage sum, which accounts for the contraction inemployment and hours worked, shrank in 2009,although it has already rebounded during2010.

The apparently strong financialpositionofhouseholds, coupled with a healthy banking sector and some regionalhousingshortages, is driving the real-estate market towardsa new peak, both in terms of price levels and housing supply. Household indebtedness has already risen to a historically high level of over 100% of annual disposable income. Nevertheless, it is still around the average for euro-area countries. The relatively highhouseholdindebtedness level, coupledwithvariable interestrates and the currently booming real-estate market, implies a vulnerability going forward if the base interest rates were to rise substantially. The main risk factor for Finland's economicprospects is the global economic and trade outlook.The Finnish economy has traditionally been highlydependenton the strength of externaldemand.Adverse developments in the exporting industries would also have a significant and immediate impact on the domestic sectors, notably byaffecting consumer and corporate confidence.  Moderate wage growth and inflation  Wage increases, largely negotiated at sector level, are set to remainmoderate in response to the economic crisis. Nevertheless, the growthof unitlabour costs is projected to turn positive in 2011, with wage growth forecast to somewhat exceed labour productivity growth in2011-12.Consumer price inflation is forecast to pick up slightly from1½% in 2010. In 2011, the increase in energy tax is projected to add somewhat lessthan ½ pp. toheadline inflation, affectingprices inseveral product categories. Changes in excise duties on several food categories are expected to have a more limited effect in 2011. HICP inflationis forecast to remain slightly above the euro-areaaverage inboth2011 and 2012.

Additionally, the government, in cooperation withsocial partners, has already decided on changes to pension, health,and unemployment insurance contribution rates,improving the general government balance by0.1%of GDP in2011 and 0.4% in2012.  Expendituregrowth is also expected to moderateas some of the investment projects coming fromthe earlier stimulus package run out and local governments (accounting for a third of generalgovernment expenditure) are likely toreact tofinancing constraints by making savings in theirbudgets. Both the central and local governments  are continuing to implement long term programmes to boost public sector productivity, which shouldalso yield some savings inpersonnel costs. Even though the general government debtlevel is currently increasing relatively quickly, debt servicing costs are being countered byexceptionally low effective interest rates on Finnish sovereign debt. The forecast assumes anormalisation of interest costs in 2012 towards thelong term average, adding to expenditure growth. Overall, the deficit is forecast to narrow to 1.6% of GDP in 2011 and further to 1.2% of GDP in2012.Driven largely by centralgovernment borrowing,the general government debt ratio is forecast to increase from about 43.9% of GDP in2009 to53.0% by2012. 26. SWEDEN Broad-based recovery helps to bring public finances back to surplus 143 The economy bounces back after recession After a period of anaemic growth following the sharp recessionof 2008-09, the recovery of theSwedish economy accelerated in the first half of 2010. Real GDP growthreached 1.9% (q-o-q s.a.) in the secondquarter after 1.5% in the first quarter. While a significant part of the acceleration was dueto the turning of the inventory cycle, all domesticdemand components contributed to GDP growth.Notably, investment activity recoveredmuch earlier and stronger than previously foreseen,despite remaining spare capacity in industry. Indicators for the third quarter pointto continuedstrong momentum in the second half of 2010.Industrial production andneworders strengthened during the third quarter and business and consumer surveys indicate high levels of optimism in allsectors, inparticular services. Followingalready strong figures for August, retail sales surged aheadin September at an annual real rate of 5.5%. Inparticular, consumer durables sales increased at an annualrate of9.5% in September, a pacenot seensince 2007. Consumer optimism is underpinned bya decisive turnaround in the labour market and continued increases in equity and house prices. Oncurrent trends, real GDPgrowth for 2010 asa whole looksset to reach 4¾%. Graph II.26.1:Sweden - GDPgrowth andcontributions-6-4-20

The improving labour market outlook should support household consumption.Investment should continue to expand, as spare capacity is gradually absorbed and also helped by continued optimism inthe construction sector. Stronger investment isalso supported bya significantimprovement in corporateprofitability, which is explainedby a stabilisation offinancial markets, the recovery of productivityand continued wage restraint.At the same time, several headwinds are likely tobe felt over the forecast period, notablya continued normalisation of the monetary policy stance, less support fromfiscal policy, and slower exports growth, withthe strengthening ofthe Swedish krona likely to exert a certain drag in the nearfuture. Since its trough in early 2009, the Swedish currency has gained around20% ona trade-weighted basis. Overall, net exports arelikely to contribute only marginally to real GDP growthover the forecast period. Also taking intoaccount a more neutral contribution from inventories, annual real GDP growth is forecast toreach 3¼% and 2¼% in 2011 and 2012, respectively.  Risks to growth appear broadly balancedIt cannot be excluded thatprivate consumption inSweden will grow faster than foreseen, given the current upsurge in consumer confidence. While the household saving rate has comedown fromitspeak of 2009, it is still at a high level relative tothe pre-crisis period. The wealth effect from risinghouse and stock prices could prove stronger, inparticular since survey data indicate that households foresee house prices continuing to rise over the coming year. Moreover, with public finances under control, consumers may expectfurther fiscal stimulus increasing their disposableincome. On the other hand, as was evident in the recent recession, Sweden's strong export dependence makes it vulnerable to any set-back in global trade. With uncertainty about prospects insome important trading partners' economies, Swedish exports could expand at a slower pacethan predicted. There is also some uncertainty withregardto the size of the output gap and,related to that, the likely pace of monetary policy tightening. On the one hand, reforms undertakenby the government aimed at making workpay should have stimulated increased labour force participation. On the other hand, the recession led to a sharp increase in European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 
unemployment, which has only been partly 
reversed. It is therefore possible that there will be 

persistent negative effects on labour supply as 

a result of the recession. Uncertainty regarding the 

magnitude of these factors makes it more difficult 

than usual to assess how fast the economy can 
grow without stoking inflation.   
The strong recent dynamics of household debt and 
house prices represents a further source of 

uncertainty in the near future. So far, low interest 

rates and a benign outlook for the labour market 

have underpinned strong demand for housing, 
which has translated into rising house prices 
(by around 10% over the last year). With 
household indebtedne
ss exceeding 160% of 
disposable income and continuing to rise, 

households have probably become more sensitive 
to changes in interest rates, in particular since most 
mortgages are at variable interest rates. 
A continuation of current price and mortgage debt 

trends for an extended period would increase the 

risk of an abrupt correction.  
Inflation likely to remain below target While core inflation remained high throughout the 

recession, as productivity continued to decline and 

a weakening Swedish currency fed through to 

higher import prices, ample spare capacity and 

a strengthening krona have since had a dampening 

effect. The short-term outlook is one of continued 
subdued inflation. The wage bargaining round 
covering a large majority of Swedish wage earners, 
which was conducted earlier in 2010 (before the 
turnaround in the labour market had taken hold), 
yielded modest nominal wage increases. This 
should help to keep unit labour costs under control 
over the forecast horizon. However, the wage 
agreements signed covered a somewhat shorter 

period than the usual three years, with many 

contracts expiring already in early 2012. If the 

labour market continues to improve as forecast, the 

next round of wage negotiations will take place in 
tighter labour market conditions. This could lead to 
some upward wage pressure towards the end of the 
forecast period. Overall, an
nual HICP inflation is 
expected to remain below the 2% target level 

throughout the forecast period, but should 

gradually rise from 1.4% in 2011 to 1.9% in 2012.  
Current-account surplus to remain large While the current-account surplus is forecast to 

narrow somewhat over the forecast horizon, 
decreasing from 7.3% of GDP in 2009 to 6.1% of 

GDP in 2012, the 
forecast implies that the long 
series of uninterrupted large current-account 

surpluses recorded since the mid-1990s looks set 
to continue in the near fu
ture. Over the last decade, 
all sectors have contributed to the surplus. The 

public sector's 1% surplus target over the cycle is 
expected to remain in place for at least the coming 

ten years. The household saving rate is forecast to 

come down from its peak in 2009, but to remain in 

surplus over the forecast period, as is the corporate 

sector's surplus.  
Flexibility of labour market put to the test As a result of the recession, the situation in the 

Swedish labour market deteriorated significantly, 

with unemployment rising from an average level 

of 6.2% in 2008 to above 9% in early 2010. The 

manufacturing sector bore the brunt of labour-

shedding, whereas the public sector and the private 
service sector fared much better. With the strong 
recovery in GDP growth in the first half of 2010, 
employment has started to grow again and 
seasonally adjusted unemployment has fallen to 
8.2% in September 2010. The relatively large 
improvement in employment 
at this early stage of the recovery is somewhat surprising given the 
degree of labour hoarding during the crisis. 

It contrasts with past 
experience of "job-less 
growth" in the aftermath of the previous recession 

earlier in the decade. Comp
anies' hiring plans as 
expressed in business surveys also bode well for 
continued employment growth in the near term. As 
the recovery continues, unemployment is projected 
to fall further to 8.0% and 7.5% in 2011 and 2012, 
respectively. A key challenge is to prevent bottlenecks from 
arising in some sectors while unemployment 

remains high in other sectors. According to 

a recent business survey
, a large number of 
companies in the construc
tion sector are already 
having difficulties finding staff with the required 
qualifications. At the same time, some segments of 
the population, such as immigrants and people 
with poor education, are finding it difficult to gain 
a foothold in the labour market. Preventing 
structural unemployment from rising depends 

crucially on the flexibility of the labour market and 

on how well the skills of job-seekers match the 

requirements of employers.

StrongerGDP growth together with the clear improvement in the labour market situationshouldcontribute to bringing publicfinances almost back to balance by2011, in spiteof additional stimulus measures of about 0.4% of GDP announced in October as part of the 2011 Budget Bill. The announced measures consist mostly of lower taxesfor pensioners and additional resources for localgovernments. Withunemployment still high, the deficit relatively contained and a strong recoveryunderway, it is possible that further measures may be consideredin the SpringBudget Bill, althoughthe  government  has  stated  that   it   is  aiming  to  return to surpluses as fast as possible. As the recovery continues into2012, the fiscal balance is expected tofurther improve and show a surplus of1% of GDP that year. The return of deficits, combined with negative orslow nominal GDP growth, halted the previoustrendtowards a lower governmentdebt ratio, withthe debt ratiorising from 38% in 2008 to 42% in2009. With the economic recovery and theimprovement in the government balances, grossdebt should resume its downward pathover the forecast period. This development is expected tobe further supported by a resumption of thegovernment's privatisation programme, withproceeds from this expected to reach about 0.8% of GDP per year as of 2011. The grosspublicdebtratio is forecast to fall to around 37½% in 2012. 27. THE UNITED KINGDOM External demand and private investment to support recovery 146 Recovery gaining momentum but intocontinuing headwinds The UK recovery started late andslowly relative to most peers but has quickened considerably in 2010with growth in the second and thirdquarter wellabove trend. However, although a return torecession seems improbable, the impact of fiscal consolidation,coupledwith a fading of temporaryfactors which have contributed strongly in 2010,make it unlikely that growthwill remain this highfor verylong. A few questionswill act as central determinants ofthe UK's progress towards recovery. A first is the impact of the required cuts in public spending, particularly whether the positive effects ofstrengthened confidence in the soundness of public finances andlower interest rates dominate the negative shock to aggregate demand. Asecond,closely connected, is the ability ofmonetary policy to support demand and offset the fiscal squeeze. A third is the exchange-rate-driven rebound innet exports which, althoughseeming for some time tobe just around the corner, has not yet materialised.A fourth is private sector investment. An eventual investment rebound seems inevitable given thehuge drop in 2009, strengthening corporatebalance sheets and improving credit availability,but timing remains uncertain. A fifthuncertainty, perhaps the largest, is the size of the output gapand hence the potential for a sustainedgrowthspurt as spare capacity is takenup. While traditional measures suggest a large amountof spare capacity, persistentinflation and survey evidence ofhigh capacity utilisation at the firm level point the other way. On balance, evidencefavours a positive conclusion on these dilemmas,especially now the big political decisionsonbudgetary consolidation have been taken, but theuncertainty around each is indicative of the size ofthe upside anddownside risks toUK performance. GDP figures a nice surprise The UK recovery began slowly but steadily in the last quarter of 2009 with two quarters of 0.4% growth, slightly below the long-term trend. This gaveway to a surprise 1.2% spurt in the secondquarter of2010, with further unexpected strengthin the following quarter yielding 0.8% growth. The third-quarter output was 2.8% higher than theprevious year, the first above-trend year-on-year growth of the recovery. Although recent figureshave been distorted by activity delayed by poorweather in the first quarter, underlying growthappears strong. Quarterly growth is forecast to slow in 2011 asvarious headwinds remain. A reduced contributionfrom stock building, falling government expenditure and the impactof the January 2011VAT rise are likely to hold back demand. On theproduction side, a slowing of the rapid expansion in construction, which has accounted for a third ofgrowth so far this year, looks imminent. However,a gradual re-employment of spare capacity focused on an improvement in net exports will support GDP throughout the forecast period, leading to a marginal acceleration in 2012. Overall, GDP growthof around1.8% is expected for 2010,followedby 2.2% in2011 and2.5% in2012. Graph II.27.1:The United Kingdom - Outputgap and contributions to GDP growth-8-6-4-202403040506070809101112pps.Output gapDom. demand, excl. invent.InventoriesNet exportsGDP growth (y-o-y%)forecastDomestic demand will grow slowly in 2011 and2012, with modestconsumption growthandrebounding private sector investment offsetting falling government spending. In the external sector, after subtracting around 1pp from growth in2010, net exports will contribute positively in2011-12. Export growth will accelerate as sterling's relative stability since the 2008 depreciation increases confidence among exportersthat the currency's weakness will persist. This will encourage incumbents to build market share and new entrants to join the fray. Import growthwill bemoderated by substitutionaway from importedgoods andweak consumption growth, although the high import content of some exported goodswill Member States, The United Kingdom 
be an upward influen
ce. The second-quarter 
figures suggest that the turning of the inventories 
cycle has been faster than expected, implying that 
some of 2010's growth was brought forward from 

2011 and 2012. Stock building will therefore make 

a small contribution to growth in 2011 and none in 
2012. 
The outlook for private consumption remains 
muted. The fact that recent weakness in disposable 

income growth has shown through more in lower 

household savings than in falling consumption 

implies that households are prioritising 
consumption over the paying down of debt and 
building of precautionary saving which appear 
necessary in the long run. Consumption growth is 
thus unlikely to be pulled into negative territory by 
a flight to prudence by households. Equally, any 
future strength in disposable incomes will not be 
fully reflected in consumption as consumers 
backfill deferred savings. Consumption growth 

should therefore remain steady but fairly weak.  

There will be some uplift to consumption in the 

fourth quarter of 2010 from consumers anticipating 

purchases to beat the VAT rise. However, given 

that the largest impact of this effect tends to be 

increased purchases of household durables and 

cars, the effect is likely to be smaller this time 
around with many households already having 
made these infrequent purchases in anticipation of 
the January 2010 VAT increase. 
Corporate investment has begun to recover after 
2009's collapse. Given that UK investment was 

low by international standards even before the 
recession, an eventual 
rebound at least to 
pre-recession levels seems inevitable. There are 

positive signs, including improving credit 
conditions, the growing corporate cash pile and the 
expected shift towards tradeables which should 
require new investment. Capacity tells a more 

ambiguous story. Production function output gap 

measures show significant spare capacity, 
implying much slack to be taken up before new 

investment becomes necessary. However, 
firm-level surveys of capacity utilisation show 
a much tighter picture. If this discrepancy is 
explained by firm closures during the recession, 

a positive shock to investment appears more likely 

as markets re-expand. However, high 
unemployment and low wage growth imply 
a continued incentive for 
a labour-heavy factor 
mix in new output. While the arguments are finely 

balanced, private sector investment growth looks 
set to accelerate rapidly enough to offset big cuts 
on the government side. 
Private sector job creation partially offsetting public sector cuts  Unemployment in the UK has stayed relatively 
stable with the ILO rate at 7.7% in June to August 

2010. A feature of this rate is however the rise in 

part-time employment. There were 350,000 more 

part-time workers in June to August 2010 than in 

the same period in 2009, with an increase of 
150,000 in the numbers saying they worked 
part-time because they co
uld not find full-time 
work. The claimant co
unt fell steadily from 

January 2010 before stabilising since June; 
it currently stands at just under 1.5 million. 
Inactivity increased from the previous year but has 
fallen in the intervening months to 23.3% of the 
working age population. With planned public 

sector job cuts of around half a million over the 

next four years, private sector job creation may not 

be sufficient to drive large falls in unemployment. 

Migration adds additional uncertainty, with 
insufficient statistical 
evidence to draw firm 
conclusions on whether a large number of migrant 

workers have returned home.  Although better 
employment performance could ordinarily be 

expected given strengthening GDP, employment 

growth is likely to lag the overall recovery. Rapid 
falls in labour productivity during the recession are 
more likely to be explained by under-utilisation of 
employed labour than by real productivity losses, 

implying potential for catch-up without much 

employment growth. A reversal of forced shifts 

into part-time employment may act in the same 

direction.  
Households' finances to be tighter In 2009 household income was supported by 

higher benefits and lower taxes. However, this is 

likely to suffer a squeeze as VAT rises and public 

spending and welfare cuts loom. Pay growth 

between the third quarter of 2009 and the same 

period in 2010 was 2%. 
With a freeze in public 
sector pay and increasing competition for 
vacancies from public sect
or job cuts, pay will stay 
weak. Contrary to previous UK recessions, the 
saving rate will dip in the short-term as weak 
disposable income forces consumers to prioritise 
consumption.

Growth in lending to non-financial corporations has remainednegative. Weak corporate lending had previously been linked to reducedbank willingness to lend. However indicators, not least the corporate sector'sgrowing cash pile, suggest weak credit demand may be the most significant factor, with the large corporations which conduct the bulkof UK fixed investment having the option of bypassing banks by issuing corporate bonds.  Credit availability nolonger appears a central constraint on the recovery. Inflation: long awaited falls from spare capacity by 2012 Inflation has consistently surprised on theupside, remaining above the 3% top end of the Bank ofEngland's target range. The 2011 VAT increasewill prevent significant falls during 2011, althoughweak consumption should ensure less than totalpass through.  As high inflation persists, theassumption that it is driven by temporary factors becomes harder to maintain.  However, there are good reasons to believe it will fall substantially in2012 once the 2011 VAT rise has passed through the annual comparison. Spare capacity is the main one, particularly if temporary restraints oncapacity utilisation imposed byhigher working capital costs begin to lift. Second, input cost pressures, fromsterling's depreciation and commodity prices, looklikely, based onprevious lag structures, tomoderate significantly in 2011. Unemployment should also restrain unit labour costs keepinginflation around2¾% in2011 and1½% in2012. Ambitious expenditure-led consolidation plans Following the large deterioration in the budgetary position in2009/10,(82) in2010/11 the governmentlaunched an ambitious plan toput the publicfinances backon a sustainable path. The deficit isexpected tofall from 11.5% of GDP in2009/10 toaround 6.0% of GDP by 2012/13, with theadjustment frontloaded. The structural deficit should fall byan annual average of around 1½% of GDP during the forecast period. The consolidationis drivenby unprecedentedrestraint indiscretionary expenditure. These plans, which theforecast assumes will be adhered to, are backed by departmentalspending limits for 2011/12 to2014/15. More details are expected shortly with the publication ofdepartmental business plans. The deficit in 2010/11 isprojected at 9.9%of GDP, around ¼ pp. lower than forecast in the June2010 Budget, primarily due to stronger-than-expectedgrowth in 2010. In2010/11, the primary deficit is expected to fall by2½% of GDP, thoughthe reduction in the total deficit Œ at 1½% of GDP Œwill be smaller because of higher debt servicing costs. The reduction in the deficit in 2010/11 is driven by a nominal revenue increase of 6½%, almost a third of which is due to the increase inVAT in January 2010 to its pre-stimulus level and the further increase from January 2011 from17½%to 20%.

CROATIA Recovery in the offing after two years of recession 152 A severe recession in 2008-10 The recession in Croatia started in the spring of 2008 when economic activity began to contract ona seasonally adjusted basis. The level of output fell by 8.7% over the two-year period to thesecond quarter of 2010. Although most of this contractionoccurredbefore mid-2009, GDP still declinedby2.5% between the second quarter of2009 and the second quarterof 2010.  Before thedownturn, Croatia had enjoyed growthabove 4%per year drivenby domestic demand,fuelledby large capital inflows and strong credit growth. But the global financial and economiccrisis hit the economy hard, particularly in 2009, whenGDP dropped by 5.8%. Investment declinedby almost 25% in the course of the recession. The sharp decline in domestic demand was partly offsetby improving net exports (see graph II.28.1) as imports declined more than exports. The current-account deficit narrowedfrom around 9% to 3% of GDP. Employment reacted relatively slowly to the decline inoutput. But in the first half of2010 the unemployment rate surged toa level above 12% ofthe labour force. Inflation has dropped by about 5pps. over the past two years toaround 1%. Graph II.28.1:Croatia - GDP growthandcontributions-12-8-404812040506070809101112pps.Net exportsPrivate consumptionPublic consumptionInvestmentGDP growth(y-o-y%)forecastThe economy at a turning point Recent data indicate that the recession bottomed out around mid-2010 and that a recovery hasbegun. Mostnotably, industrial production has started to show anupward trend. Retail trade has also increasedon a year-on-year basis. Netexports, which had already softened the recession, are apparently continuing to contribute positivelyto GDP growth in the second half of this year. Exports rose in annual terms in the first two quarters of the year whereas imports continued tofall. Physical indicators of tourism in the 2010-season have beenstrong. There are signs of an upturn in consumer confidence. Private consumption is getting some impetus from the gradual lifting of the so-called "crisis tax" which was imposed in 2009. Aturnaround inhousehold sentiment and spending is also suggested bya modest revival in bank lending to this sector.Although investment activity, in particular in construction, continues to be very subdued, the available datapoint to a slow expansion of overalleconomic activity in the thirdquarter.  The upturn is likely to remain moderate Although economic activity seems to be gatheringsomemomentum, it is unlikely that the economy will return to pre-recession growth rates, at least in the short term. The weak labour market continues to exert downward pressure on incomes and spending. Not only is employment still falling, butaverage gross wages in the private sector have embarkedon a declining trend over the past year. The high level of indebtedness ofhouseholds andcompanies and their need to deleverage areweighing on domestic demand. Credit availabilityis likely to remain relatively restricted. Investorconfidence has taken a severe beating during the recession andwill take some time to recover. The export performance is falling short of growth in major export markets.  Overall, these headwindsare bound to restrain the recovery. The banking sector has demonstratedresilience during the crisis and is well-capitalised andprofitable. Maintaining soundness in the financialsectorwill be crucial for a sustained recovery. The quality of loan portfolios has continued todecline in 2010, reflecting in particular a strongrise in non-performing loans and continuing liquidityproblems in the non-financial corporate sector. Thegovernment's credit programmes through theCroatian Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment have shown mixed results so far and may not provide the hoped-for boost tooveralllending to the corporate sector. The levels ofinterest rates in lending to households and firmsremain relatively high inview of financial marketCandidate Countries, Croatia 
conditions. Together with the general credit 
restraint, this will continue to hold back business 

and consumer spending. 
The government has announced a set of public 
investments projects, but they have not yet been 
budgeted for. Their ev
entual impact on overall 
investment activity remains uncertain, not least in 
view of the existing budgetary constraints. For the 
same reason, the recovery is expected to get only 

limited support from government spending. 

Nevertheless, public consumption is projected to 

make a positive Œ though small Œ contribution to 
growth over the forecast period. The still-rising 
number of unemployed will lead to higher 
disbursement of unemployment benefits into 2011. 
An increased number of pensioners will also result 
in higher transfer payments. Furthermore, public 
wages are set to show some increase next year.  
Net exports provided a significant offset to 
faltering domestic demand during the recession. 
This will still show in the annual GDP data for 

2010 as imports are relatively slow to recover at 

the beginning of the upturn (see Graph II.28.1). 

But given the structure of the economy, imports 

are bound to pick up soon as the recovery takes 
hold. Although export growth is set to continue, it 
will probably happen at lower rate than in 2010 
since import growth among trading partners is 
projected to soften. Furthermore, Croatia 

is currently losing market share and this is likely to 

continue over the next two years. Going forward, 

net exports are therefore pr
ojected to exert a small 
drag on growth, as was the case prior to the 
recession. Annual GDP will still register a significant decline 
in 2010 (-1.8%) 
since output contracted until 
mid-year on a seasonally adjusted basis. 

Subsequently, the recovery is projected to result in 

annual average growth rates of 1.5% in 2011 and 
2.1% in 2012.  Private consumption and 
investment, including a renewed build-up of 
inventories, will emerge as the main drivers of this 
modest growth performance. Upside risks to this 
forecast are mainly related to a faster-than-
projected economic recovery in the EU. The 
approaching accession to th
e EU may also provide 
some additional impetus to the economy through, 

inter alia, stronger net FDI inflows. But more 
importantly, there are significant downside risks 
related to the speed of private sector deleveraging 

and dependence on external financing. 

Furthermore, the delay in fiscal consolidation may 
hurt both investment and consumption via higher 
borrowing costs. 
Current-account deficit to widen again As a result of the recession, the high external 
deficits underwent severe adjustments. Reduced 

capital inflows and sharply lower domestic 

demand resulted in much lower trade and 

current-account deficits. In 2010, the latter is 

projected to fall to 2.8%
 of GDP, compared to 
9.2% two years earlier. At this stage of the 
business cycle, the external balances are not only 
benefitting from still declining imports, but also 
from the turnaround to growth in exports of goods 
and services. As for the upcoming years, total 
exports are expected to continue to increase, albeit 
a somewhat slower rate than in 2010. However, 
import growth is projected to slightly outpace 

export growth. This widens the current-account 

deficit to 3.7% of GDP for 2011 and to 4.7% for 

2012. The risks around this projection are 

significant. On the one hand, the declining trend in 
unit labour costs could improve international 
competitiveness to an extent which is not factored 
into the projected export performance. On the 
other hand, the pent-up demand for foreign goods 

and services could also lead to a stronger than 

expected increase in imports. 
Inflation pressures to remain low The recession was associated with a disinflationary 

process which lowered inflation to around 1% by 

mid-2010. It was primarily driven by the growing 

slack in the use of resour
ces transmitted to price- 
and wage-setting. Additional reasons were the 

sharp declines in energy 
and food prices following 
the spikes in 2008. Notwithstanding the rebound in 
energy prices, disinflation has continued in 2010 
helped by declining gross average wages. Core 
inflation has even turned slightly negative.  
Inflation pressures are expected to remain low over 
the forecast horizon in spite of the upturn in 
economic activity. Cost push pressures from the 
domestic side should be insignificant as unit labour 
costs will continue to decline. There will be some 
pass-through from higher import prices, 
particularly from energy 
and energy-related prices. 
Much of this will be transmitted via increases in 

administratively-set prices
. The recent rise in 
agricultural raw materials can also be expected to 
find its way into the cons
umer basket. The forecast 
projects an uptick in consumer price inflation from

Labour market improving with a lag The unemployment rate has increased from anannual average of 9.1% in2009 to12.4% in the secondquarter of2010. As employmentcontinues its declining trend inthe second half ofthe year, the annual average for 2010 isprojected toreach 12.5%. The labour market is only expected to see a turnaround towards increasing employment in the course of 2011.However, asthe labour force is projected todecline even faster than employment, theunemployment rate will show a small decrease. As the recovery takes a stronger hold in 2012, the unemployment rate should fall more significantly, to around11%. In spite of the highlevelof unemployment, wages are likely toshow some downward "stickiness" Œmore in the   public    sector,    less   in   the private sector. A sharply higher fiscal deficit The recession put public finances under severepressures   and   necessitated   adjustments   to   theoriginal budget plans in the course of2009 and2010. Last year, the government adopted threebudget revisions. This year, a significant budget revisionwas adopted in August, taking into account weaker-than-expected economicactivity and providing for some limited fiscalmeasures. Asa result, the planned general government deficit increasedby almost 2 pps. of(the revised) GDP.The forecast projects a deficit corresponding to 5.7%ofGDP in 2010. There is little chance that the fiscal deficit will narrow significantly over the next two years. The upcoming parliamentary elections constitute a major hurdle for near-termrebalancing.It is projected that the deficit willwiden somewhat in 2011before falling back toaround the current level in 2012when the recovery will boost tax revenues more decisively. General government debt is setto increase sharply fromaround 35% in2009 to almost 50% in2012. 29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA From a mild recession to a modest recovery 155 External demand supported recovery so far – After a rather moderate output decline in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, economic activity appears to have gainedmomentum in the secondquarter, registering year-on-year output growth of 0.4%. However, due to a weak first quarter, output in the first half of 2010 was still about ¼% lower than a year before. The main positive contribution to growth came from exports, while all domesticdemand components werelower than a year before, inparticular investment, which in realterms is reported tobe some 20% lower than in the first half of 2009. However, imports declined in line with domestic demand, which prevented a significantly sharper output decline. Private consumption declined by more than3% in the firsthalf of2010, despite slightly increasingprivate transfers rising to nearly 19% of GDP and increased public transfers which also helped to stabilise domestic income anddemand.On the supplyside, publicadministration and financialservices were the main growth-supporting sectors,while manufacturing andagriculture had the biggest negative growth contribution. The financialsector's lending sloweddown markedly in 2009but resumed in 2010. However, due to a minimal exposure to toxic assets, the direct impact of thefinancial crisis has remained minor sofar.  Consumer-price inflation accelerated to 2.7% in October, bringing average headline inflation to 1.3% during the first ten months of 2010. Energyprices, which rose by 8.8% during this period, were important contributors to the price acceleration.  Graph II.29.1:The former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia - Labourmarket-5-3

Employmentdeclined byabout 1%y-o-y, compared to an increase in employment by3.5% in 2009. The numberof unemployedcontinued todecline, however, as a result of a shrinking labour force, the unemployment ratenevertheless increased slightly, from 31.9% in the second quarter of 2009 to 32.1 in the secondquarter of 2010. About 20% ofthe unemployedarebetween 15-24 years old. Unemployment in thisage group remainedlargely unchanged at some55%. Nominalwage growth slowedto 0.3%inthe second quarter. The exchange rate of the Denar has remainedlargely unchanged against the euro at a level of 61.4 MKD/EUR.  In the near term, domestic sources for growth will be key ... In the second half of2010, economic activity isexpected togain momentum, benefitting not only fromimproved consumer confidence but also froma recovery of export markets. Thus, despite a weakfirsthalf year, annualGDP growth could increaseto slightly above 1% in 2010. In the remainingforecast period, the global demand dynamics isexpected to decelerate, leaving the generation of output growth mainly to domestic factors. The forecast expects a moderate acceleration in private consumption, driven by improved consumer confidence and stable private transfers fromabroad. Investment, and inparticular construction, shouldbenefit from improved access to foreign financing, which could help toalleviate domesticfinancing constraints and would allow longdelayed infrastructure investments to be realised. Overall, in 2011-12, output growth is likely toaccelerate, albeit at a modest pace, reaching slightly above2% in2011 and about2½% in2012.  Overall, real disposable income is expected toremain fairly stable, benefiting from relatively low inflation andthe stabilising impact of workers' remittances. In recent years, workers' remittances and other private capital inflows have increased tomore than 18% of GDP. During the forecast period, these inflows are expected to return to previous levels of some 15% ofGDP, reflectingthe more difficult labour market situations in hostEuropean Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 countries. As long as international prices for energy and raw materials remain moderate, inflation will probably remain low during the forecast period. This should support the realincome of households. Labour income is likely tostagnate in the near future because of low growthof employment and wages. During recent years, employment growth has beenrather high at around 3% annually. However, a significant share of thoseadditional jobs appears to be the result of a stricter registration procedure and do not necessarilyreflect newly created employment. In view of the likely still difficult international environment in 2011-12, the country's potential for creating employment or raising real wages will remainlimited. Improving the country's labour income isthus closely linked to improving productivity bymodernising and deepening the capital stock.

Public finances are likely to remain undercontrol  Based onthe country's track-record ofrespectingfiscal targets, the forecast expects publicsector deficits to decline from 2¾% of GDP in2009 to2½% in 2010and to 2¼% of GDP in 2012. The budget for 2011 and programmes for 2012 envisage a significant increase in public spending. Accelerating domestic activity and improvedefficiency in tax collection shouldhelp toachievethose targets. The forecast expects that in case ofspending constraints, the authorities will reduce capital spending, as has happened in the past onsimilar occasions. However, the quality of public spending might deteriorate further.

ICELAND Domestic debt overhang impedes economic recovery 157 Iceland went into a long and deep recession– Following the banking sector crisis inOctober 2008, economic activity and domestic demandstarted todrop sharply, leading to a marked fall in real GDP of 6.8% in 2009. The recession wasstrongly driven bya 50% dropininvestments, which was particularly pronounced in the construction and the services sector, and a 16%decline inprivate consumption.  The economy contracted further in the first half of 2010, when real GDP fell by 7.3% y-o-y.Moreover, the quarterly growth rate (in seasonallyadjusted terms) deteriorated from -1.2% in the first quarter to -3.1% in the second quarter, also indicating that the recessionhas not yet bottomedout.–and a swift recovery is impeded by a huge private sector debt overhang,– The recession is expected to have reached bottom some time during the second half of2010, laterthaninitially expected. However, highfrequencyindicators provide mixed evidence as to whether a recovery process has started. Prospects fora marked pick-up in domesticdemand appearweak. Household and corporate sector confidenceis likely to remain underminedby a significant private sector debt overhang. Currently, a significant share of private households issuffering fromsharp increases of inflation-indexed and forex debt. Also the corporate sector issuffering from financial problems and many firms would need to repair their balance sheets to be able toplanand finance new investmentprojects. At the same time, while general principles of debtrestructuring have been adopted, the process hasbeen slow due to its complexity. Many householdsappear tohave beenreluctant to make use ofexisting debt restructuring schemes, possibly in the expectation of a more generous debt relief.Corporate debt restructuring may only re-gain pace once remaining legal uncertainties have beensolved, in particular on the treatment of corporatesector loans followingConstitutional Court decisions onthe illegality of foreign-exchangeindexed loans. To this end, the government iscurrently preparing a legislative package. –subdued disposable incomes –  The scope for householdconsumption growthwill remain constrained. The level of unemployment, althoughdeclining, is projected to stay far above pre-crisis levels. Disposable incomes are unlikely to increase strongly over the short term. In theupcoming wage negotiations, many unions are likely to demand higher wages to partlycompensate for sharp real wage declines during therecession. But wage demands are generally expected to remain relatively modest under the current circumstances. Also, social partners seemto prefer a multi-annual agreement which mayinclude a modest wage rise in the first years. Moreover, indirect tax increases and announcedcuts onsocial transfers and family support will continue toput a lidondisposable incomes. Somelimited supportfor private consumption growthcould result from further withdrawals fromindividual pension savings.

There is someevidence that investment activity in energy-intensive sectors have beenstronger thaninitially estimated. Survey results and strong imports of investment goods also point topotentially stronger investments. On theother hand the forecast assumes that corporate sector debtproblems anduncertainties with regardtogovernment tax policies will continue to havea bearing on firm's investment plans. Oncecorporate sector debt restructuring gains pace and uncertainty abouttax measures vanishes, investment activity is likely to unfoldslowly. European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 A boost to investment could potentially come fromlarge projects in the energy and aluminiumsectors.However, it seems that these large investmentprojects are being further delayed due to technical,financial and political problems. The forecast projects that a pick-up in private investments growth is only to be expected in the second half of2011 at the earliest. At the same time, public investments are projected todecline in the contextof the government's fiscal consolidationprogramme.  The global outlook has somewhat improved. Stronger economic growth in Iceland's maintradingpartner countries will improve the conditions for a strengthening of external demand.At the same time, the growth of a large share of merchandise exports will continue tobe subject to technical constraints (fishing quotas, capacity ofaluminium smelters). The growthofservices exports remains limited by a relatively short tourism season. Net exports are projected to add only small contributions toGDP growth over theforecast period. Overall, the forecast projects a further contraction of GDP of around3.5% for 2010 a whole, largely driven by a further annualdecline in investments. The fall indomestic demand is partly compensated for by a positive, thoughsmall, contributionofnet exports. For the 2011-12, the forecast projectsa very mild recovery, mostly drivenby domesticdemand with stronger investment growth.  Inflation risks are balanced– Annual inflation gradually came down to6.6% inJanuary 2010, from its peak of18.6% inJanuary2009. It temporarily accelerated slightly to 8.5% inMarch on theback of increases in energy prices, indirect taxes and government fees, but continued to decelerate to 3.3% inOctober. Inflation expectationshave stabilised and inflation risks appear relatively balanced over the forecast period. Relatively high unemployment, limited wage increases, low disposable income and domesticdemand as well as the recent strengthening of theISK are all expected to support the process of disinflation. The policy regime with a strong focuson exchange rate stabilisation is assumed to continue overthe forecast period, limiting risks ofhigher inflation through pass-through effects. Onthe other hand, somemild price pressures could result from further tax increases, price rises by utility companies, potential wagepressures in the tradable sectors and a recovery of the real estate market in some areas. Overall, the forecast projects annual average inflation to decline toaround 2-2.5% in2011-12. –and the trade balance will remain in surplus– External deficits have shrunk markedly followingthe recession. The sharp contraction indomesticdemand and depreciation of the exchange rate(around 50% during the crisis) contributed to a substantial improvement in the trade balance. The forecast projects a slight reduction of the trade surplus as of 2011, as even a slowlygrowing economy willimply growing imports due to the highdependency rate while export growthwillremain constrained, reflecting the low degree ofdiversification. In line with these trends, the current-account deficit is set to widen somewhat over the forecast period.  Graph II.30.2:Iceland - Public finances-15-12-9-6

This, together with a gradual fall in the number of unemployed will bring the unemployment rate down toaround 6% at the endof the forecast period. However, this is still far above the average pre-crisis rate.  Public finance consolidation continues–  Public finances suffered a marked deterioration inthe wakeof the October 2008 crisis. Following budget surpluses in earlier years, the general government balance turnedinto huge deficits in2008 and2009, prompting the government to launch a series of fiscal adjustment measures in thecontext of the IMF programme which continuedinto 2010. The 2010 budget comprised a series ofrevenue enhancing measures (VAT, excise duties, energy taxes, social contributions) as well as cuts in currentand capital spending. Budgetimplementationin the first half of 2010 has beenlargely in line with the plan; delays inimplementing spending cutswere compensated byhigherone-off revenues and lower interest costs. The forecast projects that the 2010 deficit target for the general government budget will bebroadly achieved.  –but the 2011 budget is based on optimistic assumptions The 2011 budget canbe considered as an expression of the government's commitment tocontinued fiscalconsolidation.In order to achieve a primary surplus, the budget contains fiscalmeasures equivalent to around 2.5-3% of GDP,including freezes on wages and transfers andsignificant cuts in spending, which may however be difficult to implement. Moreover, the budget is based on optimistic growth and revenueassumptions. A budget revision is currently in the pipeline and is likely to lead to a higher budgetgap, unless the governmentintroduces additional spending cuts or tax increases, posing furtherchallenges. Against this background, and on the basis of less optimistic assumptions, the forecast assumes a reduction of the fiscal balance byaround 2 pps. in 2011. The general government debt ratio is set to gradually increase to above 90%by theend of 2012. Fiscal risks are primarily related to significant financial sector contingentliabilities.  31. TURKEY Robust growth driven by domestic demand 160 Return to positive and robust growth The Turkish economyis recovering strongly afterhaving severely contracted in 2009. GDP tumbledby 4¾% last year, a sharp contrast to the 6%average annual growth rate in 2004-08. The globalfinancial crisis hit the economy hard, therebyreducingfixed investment and external demanddramatically. Fiscal and monetary stimuli, combined with a healthy banking sector, helped tocushion the blow. Graph II.31.1:Turkey -GDP, consumption andinvestment growth-20-15-10-505101520070809101112y-o-y %-8-6

The Commissionforesees a return to positive androbust annual growth in 2010. Exports growth maysuffer from a more gradualrecovery in Turkey'schief export markets, but GDP growth could be close to 7½% in 2010, helped Œ in particular in thefirst halfof the year Œ by strong base effects.Monthly datapoint to a loss of momentum in theeconomy in the thirdquarter of 2010. Seasonally adjusted industrial outputrose only 1.2% on thequarter Œ the smallest increase seen in the recoveryso far, the unemployment rate stopped falling (sticking at 12%) and the current-account deficitdid not show its usual seasonal improvement. However, some pause-for-breath was expectedafter the rapid recovery of the previous fivequarters.Ultimately, a lasting global recovery would be instrumental in sustaining the upturn ingrowth. Due to strong base effects, which in part reflect the severity of the 2009 downturn The trough of the current cycle came in the first quarter of 2009 when GDPtumbled by14.5% y-o-y. The economy has since shown steadyimprovement and grewby 11% in the first halfof2010, helpedby stimulus measures and a solid banking sector. Growth in the second halfof theyear is expected to slow down, in line with the subsiding of base effects. Whilefixed investment is booming and recouping the losses of previous years, all components ofdomestic demand are expectedto show positive year-on-year growthin 2010( in part due to strong base effects) and tocontinue todrive growth, though at a more moderate pace, over the forecasting period. In contrast to emerging European peers,Turkish banks are relatively less reliant on external funding(the sector™s loan-to-deposit ratio is well below 100%), and have only experienced limited assetquality deterioration.And consumption and investment as thedriving forces behind the recovery Labour market developments, credit growth, capacity utilisation, and consumer andbusiness confidence point to a gradual recovery inconsumption in 2010. The jobless rate rose to 14% in 2009 from 11% in 2008, but decreasedto 12% in the first half of 2010. Disposable income isbenefiting substantially. Both consumer and business confidence indices seemto confirm that a recovery inconsumption isunderway. Graph II.31.2:Turkey -Labour market-6-4-20246810040506070809101112y-o-y%-9-6-303691215Unemployment rate(rhs)Employment growth (lhs)GDP growth (lhs)% oflabourforceMeanwhile, credit growth started to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009, albeit from very low levels,Candidate Countries, Turkeyand was even above the double-digit credit growthof the previous year. The banking data indicate that business lending is growing significantlyfaster than consumer lending,pointing to stronginvestment growth. A recovery in investment is therefore expected to be significantly strongerthanin the other expenditure categories.  Industrial production trends and Turkey™sPurchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) confirm the positive picture. Industrial production surprised on the upside in the first ten months of 2010, as it rose at double digit rates. The most recent PMI increases indicate a marked improvement of business conditions and significantgrowthof neworders in theTurkish manufacturing sector. Aside fromthe structural boosts to growth, activity is stillbeing supported by a very expansionary monetary policy, while the tightening in fiscal policy has been overwhelmingly focused on raising indirecttaxes rather than curbing spending growth, and anymove on the latter is unlikely until next year™s general election is out of the way.Fiscal rebalancing may be challenging– Compared tothe fiscal consolidation that took place in 2001-08, the budgetary performance hasdeteriorated markedly in 2009. The generalgovernment budget deficit increased to5½% ofGDP from 2% in 2008, while the public debtstock rose from39½% of GDP to 45½%. The maincontributors to the deteriorationof the deficit were the acceleration of public spending, in particular of transfers to social security institutions, whichrecorded a deficit of 3% of GDP, and the impact of the various stimulus packages.  Graph II.31.3:Turkey - Publicfinances-6-4-2024680506070809101112% ofGDP-60-40-20020406080General governmentdebt (rhs)General governmentdeficit (lhs)forecast% of GDPMost of these stimulus measures have already been withdrawn. In addition, the strengthening economyhas been positively affectingbudget revenues. It istherefore forecast that the budget deficit willnarrow to around 3½% of GDP in2010 and2% of GDP in 2011 and 2012. However, onlya credible, strong and binding fiscal rule may leadto the forecast fiscal outcome. Downside risks may also stem from increased expenditure. The government™s Pre-accessionEconomic Programme for2011-13points toreal expenditure remaining high even as growthreturns. A specific concern is that the government might ramp up spending ahead of2011 parliamentary elections in a bid to shore upsupport. Such a ramp-up would likely pressure interest rates anddent investor confidence, thereby slowing or evenundermining the recovery.  – while monetary policy may affect the recovery prospects The conduct of Turkey™s monetary policy iscomplicated by strong capital inflows fromthemuch slower growing developedeconomies. Withthe ongoing Turkish Lira appreciation and thecurrent-account deficit widening markedly, the central bank may be reluctant to place further upward pressure on the exchange rateby raisinginterest rates.  The country™s dramatic economic contraction inthe fourth quarter of2008 and the first halfof 2009year spurredthe central bank to cut the total overnight rates by 1025 bps to an all-time-low of6½% in the first quarter of 2010.  The near doubling in inflation between October2008 and October 2010 Œ from 5 to 9% Œ may urgethe bank to back away from overly relaxedmonetary policies. However, this is unlikely as long as core inflation remains relatively subdued, below 4% by October 2010. Food-price inflation constitutes the main risk factor. Against this backdrop, inflation is expected to be close to8½%by December 2010, exceeding the central bank'sinflationary end-year target of 6½%. A keyquestion is how the inflationary developments willbe reflected in monetary policy, inparticular in2011-12. In addition, anymajor cutback in investors™ appetite for emerging market assets maynegatively affect Turkey™s recoveryprospects.  External imbalances widening again The correction inexternal accounts represented thesilver lining of the recession.

With  the  recoveryunderway,  the  current-account deficit is likely to widenfurther in2011-12. However, the outlook for exports remains somewhat mixed. Exports declined by5% in 2009and are forecast to increase by5%in 2010. Ofparticular importance is the automotive sector, Turkey™s top export earner. Roughly three-quarters of vehicles manufactured inTurkey are exported to Europe. Special schemes supporting car sales in EU markets, which have now expired, broughtforward future sales.  Other non-EU Countries 32. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A return to a new normal? 164 After the fiscal stimulus and inventory building: a return to a new normal?  Real GDP growth was strong in the last quarter of2009 and the first quarterof 2010, at 1.2% and 0.9% q-o-q respectively. However, thislargelyreflected inventory rebuilding,which contributedrespectively 0.7 pp. and 0.6 pp. to growthinthesequarters. In the second and thirdquarterof 2010, growth was more subdued, at 0.4% and 0.5% q-o-qrespectively. Despite the official ending of therecession in June 2009 (according to the National Bureauof Economic Research), the economy remains historically weak in the absence ofa strongpick-up in private demand. Private consumption has been growingmodestlyover recent quarters, due to weak labour incomegrowth and the ongoing process of deleveraging byhouseholds. The recovery of investment inequipment and software has been the bright spot,supported by improved profitability as well asreplacement demand, which was postponed during the recession. On the other hand, the housing market remains fundamentally weak. The end of the tax credit for first-home buyers broughtresidential investment forward to the secondquarter (6% q-o-q), at theexpense of the third (-8% q-o-q). Whileexport growth was healthy, imports outpaced exports by far in the second and thirdquarters. As a result, the current-account deficit, which narrowed to 2.7% of GDP in 2009from 5.2% in 2007, iswidening again ona quarterlybasis (from a low of 2.4% of GDP inthe second quarter of 2009 to 3.4% in the secondquarter of 2010). The recovery in employment has been veryshallow, withprivate payrolls increasing by only 1.1 millionduring the first ten months of2010. This makes up only a small share of the private job losses during the recession (-7.5 million). Notwithstanding weak employment growth, the unemployment rate has moved sideways since the start of 2010, due to a continued decline inlabourforce participation.The weak momentumin the economy has led to an unusually low inflation rate, which has caught the attention of the monetaryauthorities. Headline inflationwas 1.1% in September, while core inflationfell to 0.8% Œ the lowest in many years. The fiscal deficit of the general government peaked at 12.2% of GDP in the second quarter of2009 and has since remained very large. Notwithstanding receipts growing twice as fast asexpenditure (6.8% y-o-y vs. 3.3% y-o-y), the deficit was still 11.2% of GDP in the secondquarter of 2010. Developments in labour and housing markets crucial to the recovery The persistent weakness in the labour market is one of themost important headwinds to the recovery. Unemployment insurance claims remainstubbornly high and the duration of unemploymentis at a record level. The latter may point to a structural element in unemployment, which may be linked to sectoral shifts and the extension of unemployment benefits coverage. In addition, the ongoing problems in the housing market could hamper labour mobility. More than a fifthofhomeownershave mortgage loans which arehigher than the worth of their houses. As a result unemployed workers cannot easily relocate to places where prospects of finding a job are better. Graph II.32.1:US -Labour-marketdevelopments234567891011050607080910105107109111113115117Unemployment rate (lhs)Private employment (rhs)mio%of labour forceThe weakness of the housing market has beenhighlighted by the sharp drop in housing starts andsales, following the withdrawal of the homebuyers' tax credit inspring 2010. In autumn 2010, a legal investigation started on whetherbanksthatforeclose on bad loans failed to review documents properly or submitted false information to evict delinquent borrowers. This caused some banks totemporarily suspend foreclosures. The main risk inthis respect is that it postpones the clearing of the overhang of the housing supply, and as a resultOther non-EU Countries, The United States of America causes further delays in the recovery in the housing market.Policies will also play a crucial role Monetary and fiscal policies have kick-started andaccelerated the recovery from the crisis. A balance now has to be found between unwinding the largestimulus and continuing support to the economy.On the monetary side, the Fed has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0-0.25% since late 2008. In April 2010 the Fed started towind down some of its extraordinary liquiditymeasures. However, in view of signs of weakness in the economy, the Feddecided inAugust to maintain the size of its balance sheet byreinvesting the proceeds of maturing mortgage andagency debtholdings into US treasuries, bringingthe gradual shrinkingof its balance sheet to a halt.  At its 3 November 2010 meeting, the Fed launched a new roundofquantitative easing ("QE2"), as progress towards its objectives of full employment andprice stability had beendisappointingly slow. The Fed plans to buy USD 600 bn oflonger-term Treasury securities by the middle of 2011, at a pace of USD 75 bn a month. Through this operation, the Fed aims at lowering long-term interest rates and encouraging investment in stocksand corporate bonds. Moreover, it boosts the amountof money in the economy and shouldraise inflation expectations as a result. As a side effect, ceteris paribus, the exchange rate of the dollar weakens.  Fiscal policy has given the neededsupport to the economy, but this comes at a cost. The fiscal deficit of general government remains very large. In the short-term, a decision is needed on theso-called Bush tax cuts, which refer to income taxcuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 and are set to expireat the end of this year. While even a temporaryextensionof the tax cuts will make it very difficultfor the government to reach its medium-term fiscal goal Œ stabilising the fiscal deficit at 3% of GDP by 2015 Œ letting all the tax cuts expire would beundesirable inview of the faltering recovery. Thisforecast assumes an extension for middle-incomeearners.  The composition of growth improves over theforecast horizon  Economic recoveries following financial crises are typically slow, because balance sheets have to berebuilt. Deleveragingby households, the financialsector and the government (following unprecedented fiscal stimulus) takes time and implies a dragon growth in the forthcoming years.  Real GDP growth is expected to slowdown to justabove 2% in 2011 and then to reaccelerate to 2½%in 2012. Inventory building will contribute more than half of the GDP growth in 2010 and fade away afterwards. Domestic demand will fill thegap, withits growth contribution increasing from1.8 pps. in 2010 to 2.6 pps. in 2012. Employment growth will be positive again in 2011, but only in 2012 it will be strong enough (at 1.1%) to bring the unemployment rate down to 9%. The acceleration in GDP as well as the expiration of stimulus measures will bring the fiscal deficitdown to7¾% in 2012, from about11% in 2009and 2010. Graph II.32.2:US- GDP growth andcontributions-101234101112pps.InventoriesDom. demand,excl. invent.Net exportsGDP(y-o-y%)Slow growth of income and employment imply that private consumption growthwill remainfairly subdued, accelerating to close to 2% in 2012 after 1½% in 2010 and2011. Consumption will get some support from a gradualdecline in the savingrate. Growth in investment in equipment is expected to remain healthy, but no longer buoyant,in view of the low capacity utilisation (at 72.4% inSeptember, 6½ pps. below its 1992-2006 average).The housing supply isexpected toremainsubstantial due to the large amount of homes thathave yet to be foreclosed. At the same time, housing demand is expected to remain soft due tothe weakness in the labour market. As a result, housing prices are likely to fall further.

From 2.7%ofGDP in2009, it willincrease to3½% this year and 4% in 2011 (4¼% in 2012). The output gap will shrink over the forecastperiod, from -2.3% in 2010 to -1.2% in 2012. Thiswill keep a lid on consumer price inflation, whichwill shrink to 1.1% in 2011 (partly due to carry-over effects) andreturnto 1½% in 2012. Risks are tilted to the downside In the aftermath of the crisis, risks are tilted to the downside.  On the upside, stronger-than-expected external demand could give additional support to growth. The main  upside  risk  is the  possibility  ofa  fast  reduction in domestic fiscal uncertainty, in particular with relation to a timely decisionon the extensionof the income tax cuts. A clear path for medium-term fiscal consolidation would alsosupport confidence. Such a reduction inuncertainty could helpbusiness confidence, whichcould lead to a faster recovery in hiring.Downside risks mirror the upside ones. Globalrisks such as exchange rate volatility and increasedprotectionism would affect US growth ina negative way. The same is true for lingeringdomestic uncertainty, specifically regarding short- and medium-term fiscal policy plans. A high rateof long-term unemployment might hamper therecovery in employment. Finally, the recovery inthe housing market could turn out tobe slower than expected, for example as a result of the present problems with foreclosures. 33. JAPAN Weak growth ahead 
167 The economy made a strong start in 2010. GDP 
grew by 1.6% q-o-q (5.0% y-o-y) in the first 

quarter of the year. By that time the economy had 

recouped almost half of the output losses which 

had hit Japan during the crisis (between the second 

quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 the 
output loss was 8.8%).  The second quarter of 
2010 inaugurated a much more gradual pace of 
recovery. GDP growth accelerated in the third quarter of 2010 (0.9% q-o-q), but growth was 

mainly driven by temporary factors. The recovery 
is likely to take a pause in the final quarter of 

2010, as a payback for strong consumption in the 

third quarter is expected. In addition weaker 

leading indicators also suggest a setback.  
Private investments likely to take the baton 
from net exports and consumption   Net exports and private consumption are now 
significantly higher than in early 2009, as these 

factors drove the strong recovery in the year up to 

the first quarter of 2010. Net exports contributed 

more than 3 pps. to growth in  the five quarters up 

to the second quarter of
 2010 combined. But both 
components are expected to contribute less to 
growth in the future. In the final quarter of 2010, 
inventories also might deduct from growth. 
Private consumption grew by 3.3% y-o-y in the 
first quarter of 2010, Private consumption in the 

third quarter of 2010 was well above the level of 
the first quarter of 2009 and even higher than at the 
previous peak in the first quarter of 2008. Given 
the negative income trend since early 2008 and the 
already low household saving rate in 2007 it looks 
unlikely that consumption can strongly support 
GDP growth further. The strong consumption 

growth in the third quarter was driven by special 

factors like the recent hike in the child allowance 
and tax-incentives for ca
r purchases. Against this 
backdrop, durable goods consumption was up by 

11.1% q-o-q and by 24.8% y-o-y, which is 

unlikely to recur. Consumption is expected to 

become negative in the final quarter of 2010 as 
these fiscal incentives fo
r durable goods purchases 
and weather conditions cease to have an impact. 

Looking ahead, and against the backdrop of the 
strong yen, which will affect the GDP path with 
a lag, net exports are expected to contribute only 
marginally to growth in 2011.  
The outlook for private investments is relatively 
more favourable. In the second half of 2009, 
private investment as a share of GDP was weaker 

than at the trough of th
e previous cycle in 2002. 
Non-residential investments finally started to grow 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 while residential 

investments went up only in the first and third 
quarter of 2010 so far.  
With Japanese companies profiting from falling 
unit-labour costs, sound balance sheets, solid 

profits, easy financing conditions and strong 

external demand, in particular from Asia, it is 

plausible that non-residential investments will be 
a major source of growth in the coming quarters. 
As a result, non-residential investments might 
contribute more to growth than private 
consumption in 2011. This also implies that 
confidence-instilling measures, the business 
climate, the tax environment as well as the fiscal 
outlook, will become more important for the 
growth outlook, as they have a large impact on 
business investment.  
Residential investment declined almost 30% since 
the crisis started. Given easier financing conditions 
for households and increasing wages, residential 
investments are expected to grow moderately in 
the remainder of 2010 and in 2011. After 19 years 
of decline there are indications that residential 
property prices are bottomi
ng out, at least in some 
important segments of the market. Also, Japanese 
residences normally have a life-span of only 20-30 

years and therefore must 
be replaced at a higher 
rate than elsewhere. This implies a relatively large 

potential catch-up for invest
ment after an extended 
period of low building activity.   
Fiscal policy Œ the big unknown The government's agenda, increased entitlements 

and age-related spending make a moderate growth 

in government consumption likely. The 

government's intention to finance increased 

spending in some areas with the elimination of 

wasteful spending has proven to be impossible. 
The elimination of wasteful spending simply did 
not generate enough savings.  
In spring the urgency of fiscal consolidation had 
increased, after turbulence in the sovereign debt 

markets occurred in a number of countries around 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 the world. The government announced a fiscal adjustment package and promised not to increase debt issuancein the next three fiscal years. Thegovernment also vowed to halve the primary balance until Fiscal Year 2015, to around 3.2% of GDP. In the plan, all additional spending was expected to befinanced by additional savings or byincreased revenues. This implied that windfallprofits by higher tax receipts or unused funds were to be used to speed up fiscal consolidation.  Such concerns seemto have beenput on thebackburner again after the economic recoveryslowed markedly this summer and concerns aboutthe short-term economic prospects increased.  In September 2010 the government put forwarda new stimulus package worth JPY 915billion(less than0.2% of GDP). On 26October the Cabinet approved a second and much larger stimulus programme, which has yet to pass the Diet. This package is worth JPY 5.09 trillion(almost 1% of GDP), although the real additional spending elementmight be closer to JPY 3.8trillion. The package will be mainly fundedvia a supplementary budget using greater-than-forecast tax revenues, savings from debt servicing andunspent money from the currentbudget. The rest ofthe money will come from cost cuts and frontloading of public works projects. The bulk of the spendingis targeted at revitalising regionaleconomies, developing infrastructure, supporting SMEs and upgrading medical and socialwelfareservices. The government does notplan to issue new bonds tocover the cost. If the package finallypasses the Diet, it would likely boost publicspending significantly in the first half of 2011. Public spending further ahead would be somewhatlower, so that the medium-term net effect would beless significant.Because it is politically uncertain whether or not the package will pass the Lower House and the Upper House (approval is needed for theimplementation laws) and what the eventual shapeof the package will be, this package was not takeninto account in this forecast. GDP growth in 2011 could be stronger by almost ½ pp. however, if the package were implemented.  Supportive labour market  In 2012 growthis expected to accelerate. Privateconsumptionwill be stronger than in 2011 on the back of rising wages and increasing confidence. Net exports will make a slightly larger contribution to growth and private investments will continue togrow.  The Japanese labour market has recently strengthened somewhat. InSeptember 2010 the number ofemployees increased by 0.7%y-o-y, the highest since January 2009. The biggest gainoccurred in education and in medical services and health care (+ half a million new jobs in the lastyear).However, the number of self-employed workers andfamily workers declinedby300 000since September 2009. Althoughthe working age population is currently shrinking at anannual rateof about 0.6%, there is still room for an increase inthe labour force.  Deflation has proved to be more resilient thanwidely assumed several months ago. With the outputgap gradually closing and monetaryaggregates expanding, on balance it appears likely that deflationwill ease somewhat in 2011 andwill be overcome in 2012.(83)Risks around the forecast for the Japanese economy are tilted to the downside. Muchwilldepend on the gyrations of the yen and on the impact on the competitiveness of Japanese exports.

There are several other downside risks. A suddenincrease in long-term interest rates in caseinvestors lose confidence in the long-term fiscal sustainability of Japan could make debt servicingmore expensive, although this is unlikely tomaterialise in the forecast horizon. A suddendeterioration in the financing conditions couldcause investments to develop less than forecast. Wages could increase less than forecast asunemployment is still relatively high by Japanese standards and employers might continue to replace regular workers with lower-paid temporaryworkers. The relatively high unemployment of youngpeople combined with the ongoingretirement of relatively wellpaid employees born in the baby boom years in the late 1940s and early1950s might contribute to amore anaemic wagegrowth than thought and could negatively affectconsumption. Such a development would alsofurther prolong deflation and deteriorate sentiment.There are also upside risks. Income growth in largeemerging markets could bring about a sharpincrease indemand  for durable goods such as cars or electronic goods, inwhich Japan is a leading supplier. Ample cash combined with easy financing conditions could result in investments growing faster than assumed in case profitopportunities improve. Another upside risk wouldstem from a depreciated yen relative to other Asian currencies. This would have positive effects for Japanese trade and would also imply a positive wealth effect and increasing income from the vast Japanese investments in Asia.Residential investments could bounce back more strongly than expected, as sentiment and affordability improve. Government policy topromote more environment-friendly housing could play a role in increasing residential investment. Last but not least, consumption could benefit fromrising property income and relatively high realyields due to the zero -bound and deflation. Thiscouldwell lift consumption growth above the limited growth foreseen for 2011. Given the shrinking working age population andthe declining labour force, even a relatively minorimprovement in employment could havea significant impact on the unemployment rate and therefore bring about somewhat higher-than-anticipated wage growth. 34. CHINA World locomotive powering ahead 170 Strong performance in 2010 Following a growthrateof 9.1% in2009, GDP inthe first three quarters of 2010 was up by 10.6% y-o-y, with growthslightly decelerating in annualterms from 11.9% in the first quarter to9.6% in the third quarter.In the first three quarters of 2010, growth wasprimarily driven by private consumption and investments, with theGDP contribution ofnetexports diminishing, compared to the first three quarters of 2009. In the first three quarters,nominal retail sales increased by 18.3% on theyear. When deflated by the corresponding rise in consumer prices (2.9%), this implies a real growthrate of private consumptionof around 15%, very close to the one observed in 2009. Asthe nominaltrade surplus in the firstnine months declined byUSD 14.9 bnto USD 120.6 bn, the contribution of net exports to growth must have declinedsomewhat (China  publishes a real figure for overall GDP and nonominal or real figures forGDP components). Growth infixed asset investments rose by 24%y-o-y. Investment in real estate was up   by36.5% on the year (in the first ten months of 2010).As a result, there was renewed concern about a possible bubble scenario in this market. According to China's National Bureauof Statistics,real estate prices were up by 8.6% y-o-y inOctober compared to a rise of 12.8% in May, although there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that house price developments in large cities likeShanghai have been much more volatile than implied by Chinese statistics. However, since May, it seems that prices have started todecline moderately insome cities as a consequence of the policy measures introduced by thecentral government inlate April.In the first tenmonths of 2010, exports were up by32.7% y-o-y, while imports rose by 40.5% (in value terms). China's imports of petrol were up by19.5% on the year involume terms and by 61.2%in value terms.China's trade surplus in the first ten months of 2010 reached USD 147.8 billion (down by 6.7%on the same period of 2009).In the first ten months of 2010, EU imports fromChina were up by33.3% on the year, while EU exports to China rose by 32.2% and the EUremains China's largest trade partner. The EU's bilateral trade deficit with China reachedUSD 117.1 bn (compared to USD 150.5 bn for the US).While the EU and the US run a large trade deficitwith China, East Asian countries andAustralia runa trade surplus with China, and this surplus iscontinuing to rise. In 2009 exports to China accounted for more than 10% of GDP in South Korea and Taiwan, and this share is increasing (compared with less than 1% of GDP of the EUand the US). Graph II.34.1:China- Tradein goods, forecast010002000101112bn USDExImIn the remaining months of 2010, export growth islikely to decelerate primarily due to the expected slowdown in the US. Import growth is also likely to continue to slow down as China's companies had used the low prices of commodities early this year to build upinventories. At the end of the third quarter of2010, China'sholdings of foreign exchange reserves reached USD 2648.3bn compared toUSD 2454.3bn at theend of the secondquarter, the highest nominal quarterly rise ever registered. Since the trade surplus inthis period was USD 65.6 bn, a substantial part of the increase inreserves was due to the inflow ofhot money in the expectation ofRMB appreciation. However, so far RMB appreciation against the US dollar has been only moderate. Since the 19 June announcement byChina's central bank on the increased flexibility ofthe RMB exchange rate, on a nominal effective basis, the RMB has even depreciated by around 6%. Other non-EU Countries, China China's current-account surplus, which had reached USD 426.1 billion in 2008, declined to USD 284 billion, i.e. 6% of GDP in 2009 and to 4.8% of GDP in the first half of 2010. In light ofthe accumulating foreign exchange reserves, China is recording an increasingly large investment income, which, combinedwith the ongoingrise inthe trade surplus, will drive the current-account surplus up again in the second half of2010. Developments on the price front are notin line with the targets which the central bankhas set itself. Due primarily to food and commodityprices, consumer pricesŒ which were originally projected topeak in May Œ edged up to3.3% y-o-yin July and to 4.4% y-o-y (0.7% m-o-m) inOctober, increasing the risk that consumer priceinflation for the year 2010 as a whole will behigher than the declaredtarget of 3%.  There is increasing evidence that official statistics are underestimating realprice developments. Monetarypolicy, which had turned very loose in2009 (broadmoney supply M2 was up by 27.7% on the year endof 2009)has become lessaccommodative since early January.(84) However,with money supply M2up by 18.96% y-o-y inSeptember and new credits up by RMB 6.9trillionon the year in October (compared to a target ofRMB 7.5 trillion for the year as a whole), thePeople's Bank of China (PBoC) on15 November raised the reserve requirement ratio for all banksby another 50 basis points (and by 100 basis pointsfor some large lenders). Since increasingly loosemonetary policy in the United States has already started to increase hot capital inflows into China, the PBoCfaces a considerable challenge: while increasing price pressures demand further monetary tightening, further interest rate hikes could induce even stronger inflowsof hot speculative capital.  Annual growth figures likely to come in slightlyweaker in the short and medium-term In the period from 2007 to 2012, China's contribution to global GDP growth is likely to bethe highest in the world.(85) In the fourthquarter of this year China is likely to show lower growthrates as a consequence of the fading of thestimulus measures, theweaker-than-expected(84)Since then, the PBoC has raised the reserve requirementratio for banks bya total of 200 basis points.(85)In the second quarter of 2010, China surpassed Japan as the second-largest economymeasured at market exchange rate.expectedUSrecovery, the moderate monetarytightening initiated by the PBoC and the measures taken in the real-estate sector to avoid the building up ofa generalised bubble. China's GDP growthrate is now likely to reach 10½% in 2010 and to decelerate moderately to around 9% in both 2011 and 2012.

Privateconsumption is likely toremain resilient and the contribution of investment to GDP growth is expected to decline somewhat compared to theextremely high contribution in 2009 and 2010. With the strong focus of the stimulus package on the promotion of investments, the share ofconsumption in GDP has been decliningfurther,while the share of investment has reached anunsustainable level (around 50% of GDP).  On the fiscal side, the general government deficitin 2009 (2.3% of GDP) was lower than the official target of 3%of GDP. In the current year, the deficit is likely to fall to around1% of GDP. A downside risk is that the financing ofmanycrisis measures via the banking system mightcause the ratioof NPLs to rise in the medium-term and require a bail-out of banks by the centralgovernment. Local governments might also end upwith fiscal problems, if projects yield less than what was optimistically anticipated.  Another domestic downside risk is a potentialbursting of the housing bubble in some cities,(although on the basis of public Chinese statisticsthis risk is hard toquantify).

The rebalancing of China's growth model One of the main challenges to the growth outlook in China in the medium-term is the rebalancing of the economy. The large current-account surplustestifies China's imbalanced growth.  The high (nominal) current-account surplusreflects imbalances in the savings and investment composition of Chinese growth, where investmentfuels export-led growth and where the rate ofnational savings is high. This is due to Chinese households trying to compensate for the country'sthin social safety net, limitedoptions to finance major expenditure such as education, and few investment options other than bank deposits. A rebalancing of the economy would require anongoing improvement of the social welfare system(old age pensions, medical care, and unemployment) and of the education system, especially   in the   rural   areas.   Savings  by  the corporate sector and inparticular bymany state-owned  enterprises  are  also  high,  due to thelack of coherent taxation of those enterprises. Inorder to avoid a misallocation of resources and to deepenfinancial intermediation, further financial liberalisation is needed.In 2009, China implemented somemeasures in these areas, for example introducing 9-year-freecompulsory education and the three-year programme toextent provision of basic health carealso into the countryside. These fosteredhousehold consumption to some extent. However, compared with the huge spending implied by the November 2008 stimulus package, the amounts earmarked forsocial issues remain relatively small.  In the absence of a more ambitious approach tosocial security and financial sector reform and a liberalisation of the service sector, China's growth trajectory looks more and moreunsustainable in the medium-term. Against this background, the new 12th Five-Year-Plan starting in 2011 will be of paramount importance. 35. EFTA Faring well 173 Liechtenstein,Norway and Switzerland are covered in this section, whereas Iceland's outlookcan be found in the section on candidate countries.EFTA countries haveweathered the crisis relatively well, with the exceptionof Iceland.During the crisis EFTA economies were activelysupported through fiscal stimulus packages which are due to be unwound during the forecast years,albeit at different pace across countries. Government spending inthe EFTA states isexpected to be more restrained in the forecast years and domesticdemand to be mostlydriven bythe private sector. While in Norway higher household spending is expected, Switzerland is relying onincreased investments to drive growth indomesticdemand.  The traditionally positive contribution to growth from external trade is likely to resume. Growth inboth exports and imports isprojected to reboundsignificantly for all EFTA countries, and mostly inthe case of Switzerland. High unemployment rates continue to be the common challenge to all EFTA economies. Althoughremainingwell below EU levels, these are likely to remain significantly above pre-crisis levels in the forecast years. The outlook for the forecast period shows moderate growth in Switzerland (86) and Norway. GDP growth driven by consumer spending in Norway... Real GDP contracted by 1.4% in2009, withdomestic demand shrinking through all itscomponents (exceptgovernment spending) andexternal trade also contributing to the contraction.The return to growthin 2010 is forecast at 1.9%. The challenge for Norway will be to maintain itsgrowth momentum as the fiscal stimulus fades away towards the end of the forecast period. The expansionary fiscal policy exercised during thecrisis is expected to becomemuch more restrained in the coming years. The fiscal stance is expected to turn less expansionary from 2011 onwards as the fiscal stimulus package is envisaged tobe halved comparedwith this year. GDP growth is likely to accelerate somewhat in 2011, to 2.1%and 2.2% in 2012. The rebound of (86)Switzerland's outlook includes Liechtenstein.growth ismostly driven by domestic demand. The decline in investments in Norwegian mainlandindustries that started in 2009 is expected tocontinue into 2010. Investment in the mainlandindustries is expectedto increase in 2011 and onwards, though investment levels should still staywell below the (record high) levels of2008. Even though investments inpetroleum fell somewhat inthe first half of this year, on an annual basis they are set to increase slightly this year and toremainstable during the forecast period.  Export growth should be driven by services and traditional goods, such as woodproducts, industrial machinery and transport equipment rather thanNorway's oil exports. Oil production is expected to fall slightly in the forecast period. As this decrease is more thanoffset by the exportof traditional goods, exports are likely to grow byaround 1.3% this year and further to around1.5%by the end of the forecast period. However, as import growthis expected to outpace the growth of exports, the external net contribution to GDP growth should be decreasing towards the endofthe forecast period albeit remaining (slightly) positive.

Low interestrates, increased incomes, increased wealth and better prospects all contributed to stabilise household consumption in 2009, after havingdeclined for a year. A return to growthofEuropean Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 consumer spending of around 3.7% annuallyisexpected in 2010 and growth should remain above 3% throughout the forecast period, despite planned higher policy interest rates. However, the relativelyhighly indebted Norwegian households could posea downside risk tohousehold spending. Taken together, the fact that the vast majority of the loansdepend on flexible interest rates, incombination with the gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus measures, could negatively impact consumer'sspending capacity and limit consumer spending.  Norway's housing market on a solid foundation... House prices are expected to continue to increase in 2010 and 2011. The improvement in the housing market is expected tocontribute to increased investments, thus turning the decline of the pasttwo years into a possible upswing in the next twoyears.  Graph II.35.2:EFTA vs EU Net lending-10-505101520020406081012 % GDPSwitzerlandNorwayEUforecastInflation remains moderate... Consumer inflation declinedto an annual average of 2.3% in2009 and strengthening of the NOK isexpected to contribute to putting a lid on inflation, resulting in rates around 1.8% this year. In the remainder of the forecast period the inflation rate will likely remain just below 2%. The recent slumpin the Norwegian economy is partly responsiblefor a fall in wage growth. Wage growth is expectedto slow down further in the forecast period which should also limit the pressure from the labourmarket.–while unemployment remains low Unemployment in Norway is relatively low as compared to the EU. However, it is expected torise slightly this year to around 4%of the totalwork force. In the next two years unemployment should ease to3.5% by the end of 2012. Current account remains positive... Norway™s current account is expected to remain positive throughout the forecast period. Althoughthe trade surplus narrowed in 2009, as a result oflower oil prices, it is likely to widen again this year drivenby higher oilprices. In 2011-12, thecurrentaccount should further benefit fromthis development supported bya surplus ofthe service's balance.  Switzerland's economy is rebounding Switzerland's economy is reboundingfrom theworst recession in over three decades with the global economic slump hitting its exporters hard. While the economy contracted by1.9% in2009 itis expected to pick up strongly this year. GDP growth is forecast at 2.6% in 2010, decelerating to 1.8% in2011, due to decreasing growth ingovernmentspending. GDP growth should remainaround that level in 2012 at 2.0% of GDP. Overallexternal trade has turned from a positive netcontribution into a negativecontribution in 2009, but is expected to turnpositive again in 2010. After stabilisation in2012, the external sector is foreseen topost a slight positive contribution togrowth again in 2012 mostly due to stronglyincreasing exports.  With increasing saving rates and low consumerconfidence, household consumption dropped in2009 but is expected toresume moderately in 2010and 2011. Growth inpublic investment is alsoexpected tobe modest in the forecast years despite increased government focus on infrastructure investments. In 2009, exports of goods, a key economic factor for Switzerland, declined by 11.5% whilst imports of goods were downby 5.4%.  Exports are picking up again in Switzerland Exports rebounded stronglyin the secondquarterof this year, mostly due to stronggrowth in pharmaceutical and machineries exports to Asia, where Switzerland's exports are likely to gain a growing market-share. Real growth in exports ofgoods and services is expected to continue strongly this year and more moderately in 2011-12.

Overall, imports will grow in a similarway, albeit slower than exports, and subsequently,the net external contribution to Swiss GDP growthshould be slightly positive towards the end of the forecast period. Swiss inflation... The Swiss National Bank is expected to maintainthe course of its expansionary monetary policy in2011 and 2012. The key interest rate, the three-month Swiss-franc Libor, is likely tobe keptlow, at around 0.25% this year. For next year and 2012 a small rise of the key interest rate rise is likely, still leaving it however below 1% (this would still represent an expansionary monetarystance). Recent robust domestic credit growth does not seem too alarming, as the private sector is notburdenedby high debt levels. Inflation continues to be low, especially on the core measures, which are close to deflation in the second half of 2010. For the forecast years, inflation is expected to remain low. Inflation rates are expected to remainclose to1%, with a slight increase towards the end of the forecast period. In2009 Switzerlandbegan to intervene in the currency markets, buying up large amounts ofeuros between March 2009 and June 2010.However, the interventionsmerely slowed down the appreciation of the Franc somewhat, leaving the Swiss Franc in its relatively strong positiontowards the euro. For the forecast period theNational Bank is likely to continuefightingconcerns about deflation and the strongFranc, using all available means, including currencyinterventions.  Low unemployment... The unemployment rate is slightly on the rise andwill bearound 4.2% by the end of 2010, which has nothappened since the mid-nineties. For 2011unemployment is expected to remain high todecrease to a level of around 3.0% in2012. Wagegrowth is expected todiminish significantly in the same period, adding a decreasing impact oninflation subsequently.   Swiss current account The current-account surplus improved to around 12.7% of GDP in 2009. The trade and services balances should continue to recorddecreasinglylarge surpluses during the forecast years. Theincome balance is forecast to deflate gradually fromthe estimated surplus that it bounced back toin 2009. Overall, the current account is forecastto remain significant positive, at an annual averageof around10% of GDP in2010-12.36. RUSSIAN FEDERATION Below pre-crisis growth 176 The Russian economy started to recover during thethird quarter of 2009. Inthe first two quarters of2010, real GDP grewby 3.1% and 5.2% (y-o-y).Economicgrowth has beenincreasingly led byrecovering domestic demand rather than externaldemand, with export growth decelerating significantly in recent months. Growth in thesecondhalf of 2010 is likely to be somewhatdentedby the impact of the heat wave and drought, and the damage will beconcentrated in the agricultural sector. These factors will likely limitGDP growth in2010 to3½%. Subsequently, the recovery will gain more traction and growth isexpected toaccelerate to 3.8% and 4.0% in2011-12.-10-505101500010203040506070809101112Graph II.36.1:Russia- GDP growth forecasty-o-y%Growth has returned to positive territory The returnto positive GDP growthin 2009was initially underpinned by an upturn in external demand, the large stimulus package adopted inApril 2009 and monetary policy easing.While growth in the first quarter was mainly exportdriven, in the second quarter it has been led byrecovering domestic demand. Bothprivate consumption andfixed investmentmade a positive contribution. In contrast to many other economies, the return todomestic demand growth is unconstrained by the need for households todeleverage. The recovery took a hit in the thirdquarter of 2010 fromthe unusual hot weather. Agricultural output fell significantly. Developments inother sectors signala deceleration in activity in the third quarter.  The rise incommodity prices and recovering external demand has led to amarked improvement in the current-account balance, rising from 4% of GDP in 2009 to6% in the secondquarterof2010. However, exportgrowth slowedsharply in thesecondquarter. The headwinds to export growth from rapid rouble appreciation and stabilisation of energy commodity prices have proved tobe strong. Meanwhile, a large part of the domesticdemand-driven reboundhas leaked through higherimports; import growth has continued to growrapidly. As a result, the current-account surplus is projected to contract from5.1% of GDP in2010 to4.7% and 4.2% in both 2011 and 2012,respectively.  Against the backdropof the return to positive growth, the labour market improved. The unemployment rate, which shotup from 5.8% inAugust 2008 to 9.4% in February 2009, has been coming down rapidly toaround7% in the thirdquarter of2010. After a crisis-induced decline inrealwages in 2009,real wage growth has resumed. Amid a large outputgap,falling food prices until the secondquarterof 2010, and continuousroubleappreciation, inflation fell for twelve consecutive months, from12% in July 2009 to a post-Soviet-era low of 5.5% a year later. Inflation edged up to7% in September, largely driven by higher foodprices, as a result of the heat wave.(87)The strong monetary response The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) manages the rouble against a dollar/euro basket, inwhich the dollar has a 55% weighting and the euro a 45%weighting. During the crisis, in late 2008 and early 2009, the CBR intervened to manage therouble'sdepreciation against the basket. The central bank sold around USD 200 bn in hard currency reserves. In2010, as the exchange rate stabilised, the CBRscaled back its intervention in currency markets and started replenishingforeign exchange reserves. Hard currency reserves are currently at around USD 450 bn. More recently, and in contrast toother emergingeconomies, the CBR has not prevented the rouble (87)Food prices represent about 40% of the CPI basket in Russia. Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation from appreciating. The rouble now lies within the centralbank's range of33.4-36.4 against thebasket. Since early 2009, the rouble has strengthened, driven by rising oil prices. The real effective exchange rate of the rouble is now close to where it was on the eve of the crisis.  010020030040050060070000010203040506070809100100200300400

USDAfter ten interest rate cuts inthe last seven monthsof2009, the CBR further reduced its refinancing rate four times in 2010from8.75% in February toa record-low 7.75% in June. Since then, theovernight rate has been kept unchanged and theCBR has signalled that it has put anend tomonetary easing. The CBR has alsobegun towithdraw liquidity measures introduced duringthe crisis as financial markets stabilised. Spurred by the aggressive monetary easing, domestic credit to the private sector has started torecover in 2010. Non-performing bank loans haverisen during the crisis, but appear tohave peakedin the summer. The Russian banking sector appears in a relatively soundposition tomanagethese non-performing loans,as the average capital adequacy ratio rose from around 13% in mid-2008to around 19% by July 2010. The recent increasein inflationhas pushed real interest rates intonegative territory, which may slow down the growth in bank deposits, and thereby constrainbank lending. Growth will remain below pre-crisis levels The Russian economy is recovering after a deeprecession, but the recovery is fragile. Over the forecast horizon, the strengthening of the labour market andrelatively subdued inflation, coupled with revived bank lending, are expected to spurdomestic demand. However, growth is unlikely toreturn to pre-crisis levels as the contribution fromnet exports will be constrained by capacity in the energy sector and strong import growth. The current upturn in inflation is expected to betemporary as the spillover from foodprices to the rest of the CPI basket has been limited and the stillsubstantial outputgap dampens pricing power. Annual average inflation is forecast to ease toa yearly average of around 6-6½% in 2011-12.The room for manoeuvre for fiscal policy was large beforethe recessionand has been used tooffset the shortfall of private demand. In2009, the general government deficitcame in at 5.9% of GDP. For 2010, only a modest reduction toa deficit of 5.4% of GDP is foreseen. The keypolicy challenges will beto withdraw the large fiscal stimulus and avoid excessive exchange ratevolatility andhigh inflation.Fiscal consolidation started in 2010 andwill gather pace in 2011-12 through the winding down of some of the stimulus measures. According to theMedium TermExpenditure Framework, the budgetbalance would return by 2015. Under the recently revisedbudget proposals for 2011-13, the deficit is set to shrink to 3.6%ofGDP in 2011 and to less than 3% of GDP by2013. This is inline withthe forecast, which projects a deficit of 3.2% in 2012. Fiscal consolidation helps to maintain fiscalsustainability anddecreases the high vulnerability of the public finances to swings inoil prices byensuring a better starting position incase ofa negative terms-of -trade shock. The Reserve Fund, which was set up to save part of the oil windfall and to reduce the vulnerabilityofthe budget against oil-price volatility, isgradually being depleted. Reserves went downfrom USD 130 to 60 billion in 2009 as they were used to finance the budget deficit. In 2010, theReserve Fund has continued to decline, toUSD 40billion in September and may be used to finance the 2010deficit. With few funds left in the Fund atthe end of 2010, the 2011-12 budget deficits willincreasingly be financed through issuingdomesticdebt. Increased domestic public borrowing posesthe riskof increasingdomestic interest rates and crowding out private investment. To ease the financing needs, the government has approved a list of state-owned enterprises in which it willsell part ofits shareholdings, while retaining majority ownership. The government aims to raise USD 30 billion out of privatisation proceeds. Drawing down the Reserve Fund implies less 177 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2010 Table II.36.1:Main featuresof country forecast - RUSSIA2009Annual percentagechangebn RUBCurr. prices% GDP92-05200720082009201020112012 GDP 39063.6100.0-8.15.6-7.93.53.84.0 Private consumption21317.854.6-13.810.7-7.64.14.34.5 Publicconsumption7867.320.1-3.72.92.02.21.92.1Gross fixed capital formation8387.521.5-21.110.4-15.75.94.37.8 of which :  equipment3140.98.0----5.00.98.0 Exports (goodsand services)10847.127.8-6.30.6-4.75.14.94.5 Imports (goods and services)7960.520.4-26.615.2-30.411.67.76.9GNI (GDP deflator)37808.896.8-8.85.0-8.23.24.13.9Contribution to GDP growth :Domestic demand-11.27.9-6.93.93.54.4Inventories-------Net exports--3.5-3.15.2-1.0-0.1-0.1 Employment-1.30.6-2.90.41.92.9 Unemployment rate(a)-5.77.07.38.27.97.7Compensation of employees/head------- Unitlabourcosts whole economy-------Real unit labour costs-------Savingsrate of households (b)------- GDP deflator-14.418.02.312.17.14.0 Harmonised index of consumer prices-9.014.111.77.56.56.0Terms of trade of goods------- Trade balance(c)-10.110.89.19.89.18.6 Current-account balance (c)-6.06.24.05.14.74.2 Net lending(+) or borrowing(-)vis-à-vis ROW(c)-5.26.23.1---General government balance (c)-----5.4-3.9-3.2Cyclically-adjusted budget balance(c)-------Structural budget balance (c)-------General government gross debt (c)----11.311.110.7(a)as % of total labour force(b) gross saving divided by gross disposable income  (c) as a percentageof GDP178 fiscal space in the future, although public debt is expected to remain relatively low over the forecasthorizon. The weakening of the current-account balance and the sizeable output gap reduced the trade-off between the potentially conflicting objectives ofmaintainingprice and exchangerate stability.Hence the rouble isbeing given somewhat higherexchange rate flexibility against the basket. The CBR scaleddown interventionson the exchangemarket and increased the role of the policy rate in slowing inflation. The recent pick-up in inflation iscurrently largely seen as a temporary shock withlimited second-round effects. Wagegrowth is expected to continue butremainmoderate anddefinitely slower than before 2009. As a result, the inflation rebound has not prompted monetarytightening. However, should upward pressures onthe rouble intensify; there is a risk that priority might again be given to exchange rateconsiderations.  GDP growth is expected to reach 4% towards theend of the forecast period and to remain well below the rates achieved before the crisis. The assessment of risks remains highly correlated to changes in oil prices. Higher oil prices would solve many of the challenges. There are several downside risks. The economy™s high (andincreasing) dependence on the hydrocarbonsectormay negatively impact the outlook. Sizeable energyoutput growth through increasedproduction is unlikely to materialise, as existing fields are depleting and extraction becomes more complicated as well as more expensive. Recoveryin investments ismild and unlikely tobe strongenough to meet Russia™s large investment needs insupport of higher potentialgrowth. Witha contributionto GDP in2010of around20%, Russian investments remain well belowmanyother emerging economies. Despite improvedfiscal rules and continuous budgetary surpluses inthe years preceding the crisis, the gradual pace of consolidation poses the risk that fiscalpolicy could become pro-cyclical. Whilst unemployment is foreseen todecline below 8% again towards the end of the forecast period some risks remain. Regional governmentsstimulated employment during the crisis(underpressure of the central government) bykeeping industrial workers on the payroll. However, they may well lose the ability to continue supporting the labour market in the forecast years. Federal resources allocated last year to support regional governments are depleting and therefore there will be fewer incentives for local businesses to continue paying for an excessive supply of workers.

 (http://publications.europa.eu/others/agents/index_en.htm).doi:10.2765/37293KC-AR-10-007-EN-CThe European Commission publishes comprehensive macroeconomic forecasts twice-yearly in the spring and autumn. These are presented in the publication titled ‚European Economic Forecast™ (EEF), where the Commission discusses the economic situation and outlook for the euro area and the EU, its 27 Member States, the Candidate Countries as well as the EU™s main economic partners. The publication also includes thematic chapters which elaborate in greater detail on issues of relevance for the EU outlook.The autumn 2010 forecast foresees a continuation of the economic recovery currently underway in the EU. GDP is projected to grow by around 1¾% in 2010-11 (with a slight easing next year) and by some 2% in 2012. A better than expected performance so far this year underpins the signiÞ cant upward revision to annual growth in 2010 compared to the spring forecast. However, amid a softening 
global environment and the onset of Þ scal consolidation, activity is expected to moderate towards 
the end of the year and in 2011, but to pick up again in 2012 on the back of strengthening private demand. With the economic recovery taking hold in the EU, labour-market conditions are expected to slowly improve over the forecast horizon, as is the budgetary situation. The unemployment rate is projected to fall to around 9% in 2012, with the public deÞ cit declining to about 4¼% of GDP. The 
debt ratio is projected to continue increasing though. As for inß ation, prospects remain relatively 
subdued, with an average rate of around 2% expected over the forecast period. While the recovery 
is becoming increasingly self-sustaining at the aggregate level, developments across Member States remain uneven, more so than in the spring. The recovery is set to advance at a relatively fast pace in some countries, but to lag behind in others. This reß ects differences in the scale of adjustment 
challenges across economies and ongoing rebalancing within the EU and euro area.As Þ scal consolidation and structural reforms have important implications for the sustainability 
of public Þ nances and the growth dynamics of the EU economy going forward, the two thematic 
chapters presented in the EEF autumn 2010 publication focus on these issues.European Economic Forecast - Autumn 2010EUROPEAN ECONOMY 7|2010ISSN 0379-0991Price (excluding VAT) in Luxembourg: EUR 25European Economy (6 issues minimum per year): EUR 160The annual subscription runs from 1 January to 31 December of each year.Payments to be made only to sales agents on the list (see inside backcover for details).These are surface mail rates.
