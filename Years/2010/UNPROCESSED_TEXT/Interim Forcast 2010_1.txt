   September2010EU recovery progressing within an   uncertain global environment The economic recovery in the EU, while still fragile, is pr
ogressing at a faster pace than previously envisaged. 
In particular, real GDP growth for both the EU and euro area surprised markedly on the upside in the second 

quarter of 2010. This strong performance stemmed from an export-driven industrial rebound, in line with the 
continued strong dynamics of global growth and trade in the first half of the year. Encouragingly, signs of 
a revival in domestic demand, including private consumption, also became evident, particularly in Germany. 
While a moderation of EU GDP growth in the second half 
of the year is still foreseen, some momentum from the 
second quarter should feed-through to the following quarters, lifting the previously expected quarterly profile 
somewhat. This improved outlook is supported, inter alia, by sentiment indicators for the EU pointing to 
continuing expansion of activity in the months ahead, with signs that the recovery is also broadening across 
sectors. However, the global economy is still expected to go through a soft patch in the second half of the year, 
implying a dampening effect on EU ex
port growth. In addition, although fi
nancial-market conditions have partly 
recovered from the acute tensions experienced last Ma
y, the situation remains tenuous, and adverse effects on 
bank credit provision to the economy cannot be ruled out.  
Based on an update for th
e seven largest EU Member States focusi
ng on growth and inflation this year, the 
economic outlook for the EU has been revised up from the Commission's spring 2010 forecast. Real GDP 

growth is now projected at 1.8% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro area in 2010. Upward revisions are reported 
for all seven Member States consider
ed in this interim fo
recast and notably so for Germany, where the 
underlying dynamics appear to have gained much more strength than earlier anticipated. Notwithstanding 

exchange-rate developments and 
the recent weather-related price increase
s of some agro-com
modities, slack in 
the economy, subdued wage growth and low inflation expectations are keeping inflation in check. The inflation 
forecasts for 2010 are broadly unchanged, with HICP inflation projected at 1.8% and 1.4% in the EU and euro 

area respectively. 
Amid continued high uncertainty, ri
sks to the EU growth outlook rema
in elevated, even if they are broadly 
balanced.

r 2010 
Global recovery loosing momentum The world economy
 recovered by more than 
expected in the first half of 2010, led by strong 

growth in emerging market economies, particularly 
in Asia. World trade also performed strongly, with 
trade in goods returning to pre-recession levels by 

mid-year. Despite some loss of momentum in the 
second quarter, annual growth in global trade (excl. 
EU) is now expected to 
average around 12% in 
2010 in volume terms, up from about 10% in the 
spring forecast. 
Looking ahead, the global economy is set to 
moderate somewhat in the second half of 2010, 

although a 'double-dip' seems unlikely. This follows 
from the expected weaker support from inventory 
building going forward and the phasing out of 
stimulus measures. Leading indicators, such as the 
global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for 

manufacturing, though remaining in expansion 
territory, have declined in recent months, 
suggesting that the global
 manufacturing cycle has 
peaked in the second quarte
r. Despite the expected 
soft patch, global GDP (excl. EU) is projected to 
grow by some 5% in 2010, up by ¼ pp. compared 

to the spring forecast.

Analysis, European Commission 

 The global recovery is still expected to be uneven 
and is surrounded by major uncertainties. On the 
one hand, growth in emerging economies remains 
robust, supported by the rebound in global trade, 
commodity price developments and solid domestic 
demand. On the other hand, the recovery is still 
fragile in several advanced economies. While 

investment in equipment should continue to benefit 
with some lag from the increase in global demand, 
consumption remains constrained in these 

economies. Moreover, the 
resurfacing of global 
imbalances, high debt levels and lingering tensions 
in sovereign-debt markets are also weighing on the 

outlook.  
 Financial markets affected by a retreat from risk  Over the last few months, 
financial markets
 have 
partly recovered from the sovereign-debt crisis, 
though signif
icant challenges rema
in in place. With 
concerns about the strength of the economic 
recovery increasing in some parts of the world, 
a retreat from risk has become a key determinant 

of financial-market developments. 
While sovereign-bond spreads in most European 
countries have narrowed somewhat since May 
2010, they are still significantly above the levels 

seen at the beginning of
 the year. More recently, 
benchmark sovereign-bond yields have fallen to 
historic lows in the EU, with spreads vis-à-vis 

German bunds widening again in some Member 
States. Similarly, corporate-bond spreads have 
narrowed since May, but also remain substantially 

above their levels of early 2010. New bond 
issuance has resumed on the back of mostly better-
than-expected corporate results. With concerns 
about sovereign debt receding, markets' attention 
has shifted from banks' solvency positions to banks' 

refinancing risk. 
Bank credit provision to the economy has come into 
focus over the past months. So far lending growth 
to households has remained very moderate in the 

euro area and the UK, whereas bank credit to 
non-financial corporations continued to shrink over 
the summer. The latest 
ECB survey provides 
evidence of renewed tightening of bank credit 
standards, at least for enterprises. The reported 
factors behind this are renewed constraints in banks' 

access to funding and liquidity management, owing 
to tensions in sovereign-debt markets. These 
developments suggest that
 support from the credit 
side to the economic recovery could materialise 
somewhat later than envisaged in the spring.

Improved prospects for the EU economy The recovery of the 
EU economy
 gained ground in 
the second quarter of 2010. GDP growth picked up 

sharply, by 1.0% q-o-q in both regions, after growth 
of just 0.3% in the first quarter. This outcome was 
above the consensus estima
te (which was 0.6% for 
the euro area) and the Co
mmission's spring forecast 
(0.4%).  
While exports continued to support the recovery, 
expanding by a sizeable 4%
, the second quarter also 
saw a rebalancing of growth towards domestic 
demand. Indeed, the contribution of private 
investment and consumption to GDP growth 

(0.6 pp. in the EU and euro area) exceeded the 
combined contributions of inventories and net 
exports (0.3 pp.). As exp
ected in the spring, the 
second quarter figure also partly reflects temporary 
factors, such as a techni
cal rebound in construction 
activity following the harsh winter.

 Looking ahead, GDP growth is set to moderate in 
the second half of the 
year. This stems from the 
expected softening in the global economy, along 

with the fading of the temporary factors that 
kick-started the recovery. 
Based on an update of the outlook for the seven 
largest Member States, GDP is now expected to 
expand by 0.5% in the EU and euro area in the third 
quarter, and by 0.4% and 0.3% respectively in the 

fourth. This represents a slight upward revision 
compared to the quarterly 
profile presented in the 
spring forecast, on account of some spill-over of the 
momentum from the second quarter.  
High-frequency indicators support the improved 
outlook for the EU economy. For instance, the 

Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) 
has recovered from the adverse impact of tensions 
in financial and sovereign-bond markets in May-

June, to currently sta
nd above its long-term 
average. Similarly, the composite PMI remains 
firmly in the zone that indicates expansion, despite 

a slight easing in August. 
As for sectoral patterns, 
the broad-based nature of the latest survey readings 
is also encouraging. It 
suggests that the expected 
spill-over from the export-led industrial rebound to 
the rest of the economy is gradually materialising.

 Further support to the view that the recovery is 
broadening can be found in data that are closely 
correlated with developmen
ts in private investment 
and consumption. For example, the degree of 
capacity utilisation is approaching a level (just 
above 80) which traditionally implies expanding 
equipment investment in the euro area. At the same 
time, the profit situation of firms has improved. 

On the consumption side, while disposable income 
remains weak, the decline in the household saving 
rate from its peak during the crisis, subdued 

inflation and stabilising labour-market conditions 
bode well for consumer spending in the near term.

  Growth forecast for the EU economy revised up For 2010 as a whole, GD
P growth is now forecast 
at 1.8% in the EU and 1.7%
 in the euro area. This 
represents a sizeable upward revision compared to 
the spring forecast (1.0% for the EU and 0.9% for 
the euro area), reflectin
g a higher carry-over from 
the first half of the year 
and the elements discussed 
above. However, this 
aggregate picture masks 
uneven developments across Member States, 

confirming the Commission's expectation of 
a multi-speed recovery within the EU. This is not 
surprising given differences in the scale of 

adjustment challenges and ongoing rebalancing 
within the EU and euro area. 
 Inflation in the EU to remain moderate Consumer price
 inflation
 increased moderately in 
the first half of 2010. This upward trend reflected 

an increase in global comm
odity prices, as well as 
the impact of upward base effects from the food 
and energy components.  
Euro-area headline HICP inflation rose to 1.5% in 
the second quarter of 2010, in line with the spring 
forecast. Core inflatio
n (i.e. HICP inflation 
excluding energy and unprocessed food) appears to 

have bottomed out at 0.8% in the same period, 
decreasing from 1.5% one 
year earlier. In the EU, 
headline inflation was 2.0% in the second quarter, 
0.3 pp. higher than in th
e spring forecast, largely 
due to a surprise in the UK.  
Weak labour-market conditions kept 
wage growth
 subdued in the euro
 area in the first quarter of 2010. 
At the same time, annual unit-labour-cost growth 
was negative, reflecting improving productivity and 

only modest growth in compensation per employee. 
 Looking ahead, the headline inflation rate for 2010 

is expected to hold at 1.8% in the EU, while in the 
euro area it is marginally revised down to 1.4% 
(-0.1 pp. compared to 
the spring forecast). 
However, within the 
euro area, projected 
developments are somewhat divergent, with France 
being the only Member State with an upward 

revision, following increases
 in administered prices. 
Outside the euro area, inflation has been revised up, 
in particular in the UK
 on account of a stronger-
than-expected pass-through 
to the headline inflation 
rate from exchange-rate and commodity-price 
developments, as well as due to changes in indirect 

taxation.

  Despite revisions at the Member State level, the 
underlying inflation trends identified in the spring 
forecast remain valid. The remaining slack in the 

economy and weak labour 
market conditions are 
expected to keep core inflation at historically low 
levels, while the headline rate may prove to be 

volatile in the second half of 2010, driven both by 
changes in commodity prices related to the outlook 
in advanced economies and base effects. 
     5Interim forecast Se
ptembe
r 2010
Brighter growth outlook bodes well for the 
labour market and public finances  In keeping with the usual pattern Œ whereby labour- 
market developments follow those of GDP with 

a time lag of half a year or more Œ the 
labour-
market
 situation has started to stabilise in recent 
months. The first quarter of 2010 saw job shedding 

ease to 0.2% q-o-q in the EU (from some 0.8% 
a year earlier) and come to an end in the euro area. 
Similarly, the unemployment rate has held steady 

since the spring, at 9.6% 
in the EU and 10.0% in 
the euro area.  
As for the outlook, survey
 indicators of firms' 
employment expectations point to moderate job 
creation going forward, as does the PMI 
employment index which crossed the 50-mark in 

May. Taken together with the strong upward 
revision to economic growth in 2010, it seems that 
the labour market may hold up somewhat better this 

year than expected at 
the time of the spring 
forecast. Nonetheless, conditions are set to remain 
weak, reflecting, inter alia, the partial unwinding of 

support measures and ongoing
 structural adjustment 
across sectors and firms. At Member State level, 
a continuation of the divergence observed to date in 

labour-market performance is also expected.  
Turning to 
public finances
, additional consolidation 
measures taken since the publication of the spring 
forecast and the better-than-expected growth 

outlook will help improve the 2010 budgetary 
position in the EU and euro area.  
A full assessment of prospects for public finances 
and the labour market will be carried out in the 
Commission's upcoming autumn forecast. 
 High uncertainty, but broadly balanced risks Uncertainty at the current juncture is high, with 
non-negligible risks to the EU 
growth outlook 
clearly evident. While th
ese risks go in both 
directions, they appear broadly balanced for 2010. 
 On the 
upside
, the impetus from the export-led 
industrial rebound to private consumption could 
prove stronger than assume
d in the baseline, as was 
the case in the first half of the year. The broad-
based improvement in sentiment indicators of late 
bodes well for a similar outcome in the period 

ahead. Moreover, in so fa
r as the labour market 
continues to surprise on the upside Œ as it has done 
for some time now Œ the feed-through to private 
consumption could be even more pronounced. The 
materialisation of these risks would add to the 

self-sustainability of the EU recovery. Likewise, the 
spill-over to be expected from the pick-up in 
activity in Germany to other Member States may 

materialise to a greater 
extent than expected 
at present, further strengthening the recovery. 
 
On the 
downside
, softening global demand in the 
second part of 2010 Œ beyond that allowed for in 
the baseline Œ poses a risk
 for EU export growth. 
Second, the still relatively fragile financial-market 
situation remains a concern. While markets have 
recovered somewhat from the recent crisis, renewed 

turbulence in sovereign-debt markets could trigger 
further increases in funding costs and additional 
credit tightening, with adverse consequences for 

confidence and economic activity. A third 
downside risk relates to the fiscal consolidation 
underway in a number of Member States. This 
should help dissipate market concerns about fiscal 
sustainability, but may weigh more on domestic 

demand in the short term than currently envisaged.  
 Regarding the 
inflation outlook
, risks also appear to 
be broadly balanced for 2010. While strengthening 
activity and a weaker than previously assumed euro 
represent upside risks,
 weak labour-market 
conditions, as well as low inflation expectations, 
suggest that these pressures are likely to be offset in 
the near term.

r 2010 
Growth and inflation prospects in the seven 
largest Member States  1. Germany Œ strong recovery becoming more 
broad-based The German economy has rebounded vigorously 
from the crisis, posting five consecutive quarters of 

robust growth since the second quarter of 2009. 
Despite the harsh weather conditions around the 
turn of 2009-10, the underlying growth momentum 

remained largely intact and turned out considerably 
stronger than projected in the Commission's spring 
forecast. A brisk reboun
d in world trade and 
expansionary monetary and fiscal policy were the 
main driving forces behind this turnaround. The 
initially largely export-driven recovery is 

increasingly becoming more broad-based with 
domestic demand contributing more strongly to 
growth in the second quarter than net exports. 
In the second quarter of 2010 real GDP growth 
culminated at over 2%, th
e highest quarterly rate 
since reunification. A par
ticularly sharp increase in 
exports and a surge in construction activity Œ 
reflecting a rebound after the impact of severe 
winter weather and the 
kicking-in of public 
infrastructure projects as part
 of the fiscal stimulus 
Œ contributed to this exceptionally brisk pace. The 
weaker economic outlook 
for the US and a possible 
moderation of growth in Asia are likely to imply 
a softening of the export
 dynamics in the second 
half of the year. However, domestic demand 

components are set to gather further strength and to 
sustain a relatively lively recovery. The robust 
labour market which, despite the scope of the 

downturn, was barely affected should boost 
household confidence. Thus, private consumption 
will continue to be buoyed by falling 

unemployment, stronger wage growth as working 
hours are being extended again, still moderate 
inflation and fiscal relief measures. Rising capacity 
utilisation, low interest rates and the strong 
financial position of the corporate sector should 

support private investment activity, which will 
additionally be boosted by the expiry of favourable 
depreciation rules at the end of the year. Hence, 

despite some slowdown in the quarterly growth 
rates, real GDP is projected to grow by close to 
3½% in 2010. 
Despite higher energy pri
ces and a depreciation of 
the euro, HICP inflation has remained contained so 
far and is expected to accelerate only moderately in 
the coming months. Annual average HICP inflation 

is projected at just above 1.0% this year. 
 2. Spain Œ temporary setback in mid-2010 Economic activity in 2010 is forecast to decline by 

0.3% following a fall of 3.7% in the previous year. 
Specifically, the first and second quarters of 2010 
recorded positive quarterly growth, largely driven 

by temporary factors, t
hough these positive effects 
will fade over the second half of the year. 
 
The VAT-rate increase which became effective on 
1 July, led to a front-loading of consumption plans 
from the second to the first half of 2010, which 

seems consistent with the deterioration observed in 
retail sales in the third quarter. After growing 
significantly in the beginning of the year, car sales 
are also dropping sharply in the third quarter, 
reflecting the end of the car-scrapping schemes. 

Thus, private consumption is
 projected to contract 
in the second half of the year. Investment will 
remain weak: while the ongoing adjustment in the 

housing sector is projected to continue, public 
investment is set to fall as a result of the cut in 
public spending scheduled for the second half of 

2010. Therefore, quarterly GDP growth is expected 
to record a temporary fall in the third quarter, but 
should turn positive in the fourth. For the year as 

a whole, domestic demand is set to lower GDP 
growth by nearly 1¼ pps. 
 
In the external sector, e
xports recorded better-than-
expected growth at the beginning of 2010, 
consistent with the recovery of world demand. 

However, the growth contribution of net exports is 
expected to be close to 1 
pp. compared to 2.7 pps. 
in 2009 as a result of an important rebound 
of imports in 2010, driven by a positive evolution 
of final demand. 
The inflation rate continued to increase, to 1¼% 
and above 1½% in the two first quarters of 2010 
respectively. It is expected 
to rise to 1¾% at the end 
of the year, with an annu
al average of just above 
1½% for 2010, on the back of higher oil prices and 
the VAT hike. After a signi
ficant increase in 2009, 
real wages are expected to stagnate in 2010,

  3. France Œ gradual recovery on the back of 
subdued demand The French economy has been gradually recovering 
from recession since the se
cond quarter of last year. 
For 2009 as a whole, 
however, it experienced 
a significant decline of GDP (-2.6%), though less so 
than the euro area (-4.1%). This was mainly due to 

the absence of major domestic imbalances, 
relatively large economic stabilisers, the 
comparatively low degree of openness of the 
economy, combined with the limited size of the 
manufacturing sector, as well as the resilience of 

private consumption. Unlike the case in several 
other EU countries, there has been almost no 
acceleration in growth in the 
first half of 2010, with 
GDP expanding at an average quarter-on-quarter 
rate of 0.4%. In the second quarter of 2010, activity 
grew by 0.6% q-o-q. As before, domestic demand 

was the main driver of growth, complemented by 
the impact of a decelerati
on in destocking. In spite 
of the recovery in world trade and the depreciation 

of the euro, net trade 
was a drag on growth, 
as imports expanded strongly.  
The same structural features
 that partly shielded the 
French economy during the 
crisis will continue to 
contain the pace of expansion. Although business 
climate indicators are cl
ose to their long-term 
average, they have recently levelled off and remain 
below their historical recovery levels. This suggests 
a slowdown of economic expansion compared to 
the second quarter of 2010. Domestic demand is 

also set to grow at a moderate pace because the 
inventory cycle is becomi
ng less supportive. Private 
consumption will mirror the weakness of disposable 

income and the after-effects of the car-scrapping 
premium. Investment growth should be limited 
given still large spare capacity. The still favourable 

developments in world trade combined with the 
euro depreciation are expected to have a positive 
but limited effect
. All in all, GDP is likely to grow 
by 0.4% and 0.3% in the third and fourth quarter 
respectively, implying an annual growth rate of 
1.6% for 2010 as a whole.
  HICP inflation reached 1.
8% in the second quarter 
as the rise in oil prices was amplified by a base 
effect from last year. In
 2010, inflation is set 
to average 1.6% while core inflation is expected to 

remain subdued. The high unemployment rate and 
the need for firms to remain competitive in an 
export-led recovery are likely to weigh on prices. 
 4. Italy Œ exports contribute to a moderate 
upturn Italy's real GDP expanded by almost ½ pp. in both 
the first and the second quarter of 2010 and is 
expected to grow by 1.1% 
in the year as a whole. 
The 0.3 pp. upward revision compared with the 
Commission's spring 2010 forecast is explained by 
the better-than-anticipated growth impulse from 

external demand and a revised 2009 quarterly 
growth profile.  
The moderate recovery of the Italian economy is 
projected to be mainly driven by the industrial 

sector, thanks to the rebound in exports after the 
collapse recorded in 2009.
 The upturn in external 
demand is providing some support to investment in 

equipment, which also benefited from tax 
incentives that expired at the end of June. By 
contrast, investment in construction is expected to 

remain weak in the coming quarters. Finally, the 
still fragile labour-market situation is set to 
continue weighing on the dynamics of private 

consumption. 
As regards the quarterly profile of GDP growth, the 
most recent data on industrial production and 
  8 Interim forecast Se
ptembe
r 2010 
business confidence suggest economic expansion in 
the third quarter of 2010 to continue at broadly the 
same pace as in the first two quarters of the year. 
The recovery is then proj
ected to ease somewhat in 
the last quarter of 2010, due to the expected 
deceleration in global demand.  
The short-term outlook for the Italian economy 
appears subject to both upside and downside risks. 

On the one hand, global demand could prove 
stronger than anticipated, with positive spillovers 
also for firms' investment. On the other hand, 

possible renewed tensions and uncertainty in 
financial markets might affect economic agents' 
confidence.  
After declining markedly in 2009, HICP inflation 
picked up in the first half of 2010, due to the fading 
of favourable base effects from energy prices. In 
2010 as a whole, inflation 
is projected to increase to 
1.6% on average. This is 0.2 pp. lower than in the 
Commission's spring 2010 fo
recast, mainly because 
of less dynamic commodity prices. 
 5. The Netherlands Œ maintaining moderate 
momentum The recovery of the Dutch economy, which started 
in the second half of 2009, gained momentum in the 
first half of 2010, resu
lting in quarter-on-quarter 
GDP growth of 0.5% and 0.9% in the first and 
second quarter, respectively. Economic activity 
benefitted from a strong upswing in the inventory 

cycle and a rebound of investment in the second 
quarter, due mainly to a replacement of equipment. 
Although exports proved to be an important growth 

driver again Œ taking advantage of the acceleration 
in world trade and reflecting the sensitivity of the 
Dutch economy to external demand Œ net exports 

were a drag on growth, as imports posted even 
stronger growth in both the first and the second 
quarter of 2010. Private consumption showed some 

signs of recovery, especially in the first quarter, but 
this was in large part due to the low temperatures 
boosting households' energy consumption.   
The momentum of economic growth created in the 
second quarter is expected to continue partially in 
the third quarter, leading to quarter-on-quarter 
growth of 0.4%. With the fading of some temporary 

growth drivers, such as stock building, real GDP 
growth is expected to weaken again in the fourth 
quarter to 0.3% q-o-q, so
 that annual real GDP 
growth is projected to r
each 1.9% in 2010. Private 
consumption is likely to remain subdued throughout 
the second half of 2010, given a strong and rapid 

decline in wage growth, as reflected in recent wage 
agreements. Additionally, limited support for 
private consumption is expected to stem from 

labour-market developments, in spite of the latter 
having outperformed expectations. The positive 
growth dynamics of investment displayed in the 

second quarter are likely to
 slow down, especially 
towards the end of 2010, reflecting a loss of 
demand momentum and a below-average capacity 

utilisation. Net trade is most likely to contribute to 
growth only moderately, given the expected 
softening of world-trade growth.  
The annual HICP inflation rate was historically low 
in the first half of 20
10, reaching 0.4% in the 
second quarter. It is projected to increase in 
the third quarter, mainly as a result of a positive 

contribution of energy prices coming from a base 
effect. Overall, for 2010, 
inflation is expected to 
reach 1.1%.

  6. Poland Œ manufacturing sector leads the 
recovery  Economic activity continued to be strong in the 
second quarter of 2010, w
ith GDP growth reaching 
1.1% q-o-q. The upswing was driven by a strong 
manufacturing sector (industrial production (s.a.) 
grew by 10.5% y-o-y in the second quarter of 2010) 
    9Interim forecast Se
ptembe
r 2010
and a sharp rebound in world trade that brought 
Polish exports to their pre-
crisis levels. Moreover, 
domestic demand increased on the back of 
rebuilding inventories and accelerating private 

consumption, fuelled by improving confidence as 
the recovery becomes firmer, and the overall 
resilience of the labour market. However, private 

investment continued to suffer from uncertainties 
regarding the global recovery and low capacity 
utilisation levels.  
In 2010 real GDP growth 
is expected to accelerate 
to 3.4%, ¾ pp. higher 
than expected in the 
Commission's spring forecast. This follows from 
the better-than-expected result in the first half of 

2010.  
Quarterly real GDP growth
 is projected to slow 
somewhat in the third quarter of 2010 and remain 
stable in the final quarter of the year. The recovery 

is likely to be mild in the second half of the year, as 
the impetus from stock-building is likely to peter 
out and employment growth will remain sluggish 
towards the end of 2010. Although part of the 
labour-market adjustment was achieved through 

real wages, labour hoarding during the slowdown 
will imply less employment-rich growth and some 
re-adjustment of wages in the years to come. 

Stagnating employment and real wages will weigh 
on real disposable income and, combined with 
necessary fiscal consolidation, limit the potential 

for a strong rebound of domestic consumption. 
Investment growth will mainly reflect robust public 
spending in capital expenditure, while tight 

financing conditions and excess capacity in certain 
sectors will hamper growth in private investment.  
The annual HICP inflation rate reached 2.5% in the 
second quarter of 2010, a notch higher than in the 

spring forecast. It is expected to remain below 
the central bank's inflation target of 2.5% within the 
forecast horizon, reflecti
ng the remaining slack in 
the economy.
   7. The United Kingdom Œ inventory build-up 
helps sustain economic recovery In the second quarter of 2010, the UK's quarter-on-
quarter GDP growth accelerated sharply and 
unexpectedly to 1.2% fro
m 0.3% in the preceding 
quarter. The rate of growth was the highest since 
2001 and more than twi
ce that projected by the 
Commission services in spring 2010. Output 
growth was primarily driven by the turning of the 
inventory cycle and resilient household spending, 
which contributed 1.0 pp. and ½ pp. to growth 

respectively. Net trade, which had contributed 
negatively to growth in th
e previous three quarters, 
made a neutral contribution to second quarter 

growth, with export performance strengthening.  
Economic growth is expected to slow down in the 
second half of 2010. Although inventory 
investment is expected to
 increase further, the 
extraordinary boost to second quarter growth from 
the turning of the inventory cycle will not be 
repeated in the third quarter. The announced 

increase in the VAT rate in January 2011 should 
encourage higher private c
onsumption in the fourth 
quarter of 2010. This is expected to lead to some 

acceleration in growth in the fourth quarter, 
although it will also curtail economic activity in the 
first quarter of 2011.  
Investment spending by businesses is expected to 
remain constrained by weak demand expectations 
and tight credit conditions. Export growth relative 

to that of imports is expected to generate 
a moderate contribution to growth in the second 
half of 2010, in part supported by improving 

economic conditions in some of the UK's European 
export markets. In 2010 as a whole GDP is 
expected to increase by 1.7%, up by ½ pp. when 

compared to the spri
ng 2010 forecast.  
Annual HICP inflation in the second quarter of 
2010, at 3.4%, was 0.8 pp. higher than projected in 
spring 2010. The greater part of the inflation 

overshoot was due to higher retail energy prices and 
a stronger pass-through from the sterling 
depreciation and the VAT rise to consumer prices. 

The inflation rate is expected to decelerate in the 
third quarter as a result of the large amount of spare 
capacity, although price in
creases pre-empting the 
VAT rise in January 2011 could prevent a further 
moderation of inflation in the fourth quarter.

BOX: TECHNICAL BACKGROUND TO THE INTERIM FORECAST
 Technical background In February 2006, the Commission presented the first of 
what are now twice-yearly interim forecasts with the 
objective of updating its comprehensive spring and 
autumn economic forecasts (w
ith the next fully-fledged 
forecast scheduled for 29 November 2010). This interim 
forecast updates the outlook of the spring 2010 economic 
forecast of 5 May 2010. The cut-off date for this interim 
forecast to take new information on board was 
6 September 2010. 
The interim forecast updates the outlook for the largest 
seven EU Member States, i.e. Germany, Spain, France, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Po
land and the United Kingdom 
(which are the largest in the EU based on an average of 
the ranking in terms of both population and nominal 
GDP). The update covers real GDP growth and HICP 
inflation for the current year
. These updates are prepared 
using indicator-based fore
casting models and/or 
judgemental forecasting techniques.  
Estimates for the European Union and the euro area are 
prepared using the nominal GDP-weighted updates for 
the largest Member States. In terms of nominal GDP, 
these countries account for 79% of the European Union, 
while the five euro-area Member States account for 83% 

of the euro-area aggregate. The outlook for the smaller 
Member States has not been individually updated. The 
Commission has made projections for the euro area and 
the EU using the updates for the five and seven largest 
Member States respectively, and assuming that the 
revisions to GDP and inflat
ion for the smaller Member 
States are proportionate to those of the larger ones. 
Quarterly data are updated with the latest available 
information. When comparing quarterly with annual GDP 
growth it must be kept in mind that, whenever possible, 
quarterly data are adjusted for both seasonal influences 
and the number of working days while annual data is 
presented in unadjusted form. Calendar factors are, 
however, relatively small in 2010. 
External conditions  This forecast is based on a 
set of external assumptions. 
Technical assumptions are used for exchange rates, 
interest rates and oil prices. These assumptions are based 
on market expectations at the time of the forecast. To 
shield these assumptions from possible volatility during 
one specific trading day, averages from a 10-day 
reference period have been used.  
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates has 
been standardised using fixed nominal exchange rates for 
all currencies. They are kept constant based on the 
averages from 10 days up to
 3 September, implying 
e.g. an annual average of USD/EUR of 1.30.  
Interest-rate assumptions are, since spring 2007, 
market-based instead of expert-based. These assumptions 
should be interpreted with caution, as market-based 
assumptions do not only reflec
t policy rate expectations, 
but also liquidity conditions in a period of market 
uncertainty. Short-term interest rates for the euro area are 
derived from futures contracts.
 Long-term interest rates 
for the euro area, as well as 
short- and long-term interest 
rates for Poland and the UK are calculated using implicit 
forward swap rates, corrected for the spread between the 
3-month interbank interest rate and the 3-month 
swap-rate. In this forecast, the short-term rate is assumed 
to be at 0.8% and the long-term interest rates at 2.6% in 
2010 for the euro area. 
The outlook for oil prices is based on futures prices. The 
price per barrel of Brent crude oil is projected at 77.1 
USD/barrel in 2010 (corresponding to 58.9 EUR/barrel). 
This would be 7.4 USD/barre
l lower (or 3.2 EUR/barrel lower) than assumed in the spring 2010 forecast.  
Global demand in 2010 is revised upwards, following the 
somewhat stronger-than-expected growth in the first half 
of 2010, specifically in emerging economies, and 
a rebound in world trade and industrial production. 
Global GDP growth, excluding the EU, is now forecast to 
accelerate to around 5% in 2010, about ¼ pp. higher than 
expected in the spring forecast. World trade is set to rise 
substantially in 2010, with growth in export and import 
volumes (excluding the EU) estimated at around 12% (up 
from about 10% in the spring forecast).
