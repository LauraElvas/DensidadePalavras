May 11, 2015

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As central, eastern, and southeastern Europe (CESEE) continues to recover, lower oil prices,
stronger euro area growth, and geopolitical tensions are affecting countries differently,
resulting in three-speed growth in the region:


In the Baltics, central and eastern Europe (CEE), and Turkey, growth is expected to remain solid—
ranging from 2.6 to 3.6 percent in 2015–16—supported largely by private consumption boosted
by cheaper oil and stronger euro area recovery.



In southeastern Europe (SEE), recovery is projected to be muted (real GDP growth at 1.9 percent
in 2015 and 2.4 percent in 2016), with debt overhang and other structural weaknesses, as well as
a less supportive fiscal stance outweighing a modest boost from lower oil prices and stronger
euro area growth.



Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries are expected to contract in 2015, with the
largest output declines in Russia (–3.8 percent) and Ukraine (–5.5 percent)—reflecting lower oil
prices and sanctions (Russia) and the fallout from geopolitical tensions and ongoing
macroeconomic adjustment (Ukraine).

Most CESEE countries outside the CIS continue to grapple with downward price pressure.
Lower oil prices and downward inflation revisions in the euro area have significantly dampened the
inflation outlook in CEE and SEE. Persistently lower prices and economic slack increase the risk of
second-round effects through lower wages, which could entrench deflation pressure.
Despite many differences, in most CESEE countries private investment and growth remain
below precrisis levels. This reflects uncertainties about the strength of global and euro area
recovery, but also private sector balance sheet weaknesses in a number of CESEE countries. Before
the 2008–09 global financial crisis, private debt stocks across CESEE increased much faster than GDP,
opening up credit gaps, whereby the debt-to-GDP ratios are lifted well above their long-term
trends. In the aftermath of the crisis, many countries came under pressure to realign their debt levels
with economic fundamentals, resulting in simultaneous deleveraging, which exacerbated the overall
decline in economic activity.
How large are the remaining credit gaps and are private balance sheet weaknesses holding
back recovery? To answer this question, this report studies the post-2008 adjustment

CESEE REI SPRING 2015

in private non-financial sector debt and its impact on economic activity:


How much deleveraging took place? Despite significant deleveraging efforts—as measured by
the adjustment in private sector net saving-investment balances—relatively few countries
managed to reduce their private-debt-to-GDP ratios below precrisis levels. This largely reflected
weak debt repayment capacity and lack of debt restructuring. In some cases, debt burdens
increased because of foreign exchange valuation effects.



What is the economic cost of deleveraging? While deleveraging is necessary, it tends to be more
protracted and entails larger output losses if the debt problem is pervasive, macroeconomic
policies are not sufficiently supportive, and institutional frameworks are less flexible. Financial
sector resilience and the external environment matter as well. Compared with the SEE countries,
the Baltic countries adjusted faster not only because they had more flexible institutions, but also
because of their stronger trade and financial links to countries less affected by the crisis.



Where are the remaining credit gaps across CESEE countries? Postcrisis deleveraging has not been
sufficient to align private debt with economic fundamentals in a number of countries. Bulgaria,
Croatia, and Ukraine stand out as requiring further adjustment, and debt-related risks in their
corporate sectors are still elevated, which is also the case in Latvia and Slovenia.



How can CESEE countries grow out of debt? Highly indebted CIS and SEE countries may not be
able to grow out of debt without significant institutional reforms. A comparison with
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries shows that CIS and
SEE countries are lagging in key areas of structural reform.

In order to revive investment and ensure robust recovery, policies should aim at supporting
domestic demand and completing the repair of private sector balance sheets.


Macroeconomic policies should be mindful of the credit gaps: In countries where excessive debt
continues to weigh on the economy, supportive macroeconomic policies are essential. Fiscal
consolidation, although needed in many CESEE countries, should not derail the recovery.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative in countries facing deflation risk.



Structural and institutional reforms are critical to lifting potential growth, especially for countries
that still face private sector debt overhang:

2

o

A lack of efficient debt-resolution frameworks and of capacity or incentives for banks to deal
with nonperforming loans (NPLs) delays the necessary adjustment in non–financial sector
balance sheets.

o

Less flexible labor markets may prevent overleveraged firms from carrying out the necessary
labor shedding, thereby forcing them to disproportionately cut back on investment.

o

Many CIS and SEE countries also face the long-standing task of improving the investment
environment, raising productivity, and reducing structural unemployment.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

Activity has begun to recover at a relatively solid pace across much of the region. However, with few
signs of a rebound in private investment, growth remains far below precrisis levels in most countries,
especially in SEE countries. CIS economies are facing particular difficulties from tighter financing
conditions amid weak confidence and spillovers from Russia’s slowdown.1 Going forward, lower oil
prices and better prospects in the euro area will be the main tailwinds.
Much of the region continues to recover. While growth is taking firmer root in the Baltic and CEE
economies, activity in SEE remains subdued (text figure). Still-high indebtedness, slow labor market
adjustment, strong trade links with weaker euro area economies, a tighter macroeconomic stance,
and a lack of structural reforms compared with Baltic and CEE countries underlie the subdued
activity in SEE. In addition, SEE countries experienced several country-specific negative shocks in
2014—that is, floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In Turkey, growth softened in response
to monetary tightening in early 2014.

The CIS economies are slipping into recession. Falling oil prices on top of Western sanctions
compounded Russia’s underlying structural weaknesses, halting growth. Recession also deepened in
Ukraine, partly reflecting declining activity in the eastern conflict zone. These developments had
major adverse spillovers on activity in other CIS economies.

Private consumption remains the key growth driver in most of the region, as investment is
held back by crisis legacies:


Falling unemployment, higher real wages, and improved consumer credit growth have
contributed to further strengthening of private consumption in most Baltic, CEE, and SEE
countries (text figure). Lower oil prices are beginning to support real incomes. In contrast,
consumption in the CIS declined further as a result of the worsening economic environment,

Inflation continued to drift downward, reflecting mostly economic weakness, including
abroad, except in the CIS, where large exchange rate depreciations boosted inflation. Headline
and core inflation declined further in most of the CEE and SEE (text figure), in line with lower food
and energy prices, euro area price developments, and economic slack (Box 1). Hungary, Kosovo, and
Poland fell into deflation in the second half of 2014, joining Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Montenegro, which were already in
deflation. Since November, lower oil prices have eased headline inflation in Turkey. In contrast,
exchange rate depreciation and higher domestic food prices caused inflation to increase further in
Russia and Ukraine.

Box 1. Low Commodity Prices: Risks of Second-Round Effects in Central, Eastern, and
Southeastern European Countries1/
The pass-through of a commodity price shock to consumer prices can be broken down into first- and
second-round effects. First-round effects capture (1) changes in energy and unprocessed food prices; and (2)
the impact on other prices via input costs. Second-round effects
Figure 1. CESEE EU: Disinflationary Drivers, 2012-14
(Contributions in percent1)
reflect the impact channeled through inflation expectations via:
100
(1) softening of contemporaneous demand as economic agents
attempt to take advantage of the expected future price cuts; and
80
(2) wage- and price-setting behavior, effectively embedding the
60
expectation of disinflation in the evolution of future wages and
prices. It is the latter channel that at the extreme can trigger a
40
deflation trap—a self-feeding vicious feedback loop between
20
inflation expectations and prices.
The importance of first- and second-round disinflationary
effects from lower commodity prices is estimated using the
open economy New Keynesian Phillips curve, in which the
effect of inflation expectations is separated from that of the
autonomous dynamics of actual inflation. Regression-based
variance decomposition based on a sample extended until the
end of 2014 confirms the findings shown in Figure 1 of the
October 2014 Regional Economic Issues report.

 Disinflationary spillovers from the euro area have been an important additional factor for euro peggers,
whereas for inflation targeters, nominal effective exchange rates predominated.
The updated results point to the presence of second-round effects, as measured by the impact of inflation
expectations, which may account for about 10 to 15 percent of observed inflation variance. Their overall

Financial conditions remained favorable outside the CIS. Net capital flows stayed positive but
slowed in the second half of 2014, in line with broader emerging market trends. Market indicators of
implied volatility suggest that investor risk aversion has risen from historically low levels amid
increasingly divergent monetary policy stances in advanced economies and volatile oil prices. Risk
premiums remained within the range of their May 2013 pre-taper-talk levels for countries outside

The Swiss National Bank’s recent decision to remove the cap on the value of the Swiss
franc (CHF) and the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) Quantitative Easing (QE) announcement
had roughly offsetting effects on financing conditions outside the CIS:


The Swiss National Bank’s decision placed downward pressure on currencies in countries with
significant Swiss franc–denominated mortgages, broadly commensurate with their level of
exposure to such mortgages (Box 2). Currencies have regained some of the lost value since the
initial depreciation, and the overall economic impact is expected to be limited, since banks are
capable of absorbing associated losses and the pass-through is somewhat offset by lower
interest rates on Swiss franc mortgages.



The ECB’s QE announcement on January 22, 2015, has had a positive impact on risk premiums
and currencies in the region as investors have started to rebalance their portfolios in search of
higher yields. The impact has been, on average, comparable to that experienced after other
unconventional policy announcements by the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve (text figure).
Reflecting the size and sophistication of financial markets, the impact varied across CESEE
countries.

CIS economies, notably Russia and Ukraine, saw large increases in risk premiums and capital
outflows. The ruble depreciated by almost 45 percent against the U.S. dollar between June and
December 2014, when companies were effectively cut off from external financing. In response,
Russian authorities took strong policy measures,2 which helped dampen downward pressure on the
exchange rate and stem deposit withdrawals (text figure). Meanwhile, faced with large debt
redemptions and cut off from external financing, Russian companies were forced to rely on domestic
borrowing from banks and bond markets to meet maturing debt obligations. The spillovers from
Russia and Ukraine meant that the currencies of most CIS countries also depreciated sharply.3

Following an emergency 650 basis point rate hike, the Central Bank of Russia announced temporary bank
regulatory forbearance to provide additional foreign exchange to banks and doubled the limit of insured retail
deposits. In addition, the authorities announced a recapitalization program of about 2 percent of GDP and issued a
directive to large government-owned companies to repatriate foreign exchange receipts.

Box 2. Swiss Franc Borrowing in Central and Eastern Europe1/
Swiss franc loans were popular in the mid-2000s, but exposure has since decreased. At the time, these
loans were considered a cheaper alternative to loans denominated in domestic currency or in euros. They came
under scrutiny following appreciation of the Swiss franc in 2010–11, which revaluated these loans by up to 30
percent and triggered a relative increase in nonperforming loans. In response, some countries limited household
debt payments by capping interest rates and/or lengthening loan maturities. In late 2014, Hungary mandated
the conversion of foreign exchange mortgages—mostly in Swiss francs—to domestic currency loans.
The economic and financial stability impact of the recent removal of the cap on the Swiss franc–euro
exchange rate is expected to be small. Initially, currencies in affected countries depreciated by about 20
percent against the Swiss franc, but they have regained some ground since then. The impact on the broader
economy is expected to be limited. Although for a 25-year mortgage contracted in 2006, principal revaluation
can now amount to almost 50 percent, about half of the impact on the monthly payment burden is offset by
lower Swiss franc interest rates. In all countries, supervisors view banks as well able to absorb associated losses.
Thus, the impact on growth is likely to be small.

The near-term economic outlook in the CESEE region is shaped by three external shocks.


A steep decline in oil prices: Oil prices fell by about 50 percent during the second half of 2014.
With the share of fuel in total consumption ranging from 2.5 to 8.2 percent, lower oil prices are
expected to continue to provide a modest boost to growth, except in Russia.



The European Central Bank’s decision to embark on an expanded, open-ended asset purchase
program (QE): The QE that started in March 2015 is expected to help lower borrowing costs
across the euro area and boost inflation. Among the Baltic and CEE economies, the impact on
inflation may be up to 0.5 percentage point. Activity in euro peggers will benefit from the more
depreciated exchange rate, while floaters will have more room to ease monetary policy without
risking capital flow reversals.



A dramatic slowdown in Russia: Western sanctions, weak confidence, and a negative terms-oftrade shock are expected to cause Russia’s GDP to contract by 3.8 percent in 2015—a more than
4 percentage point downward revision relative to the October 2014 Regional Economic Issues
report (REI). Given strong links to Russia, the recession will have significant spillovers on other
CIS and Baltic countries (text figure). For the rest of the region, spillovers from Russia are
deemed to be limited.

Overall, the external shocks and domestic developments are projected to result in more of the
same in 2015; that is, activity at three different speeds (text table).


Solid growth in the Baltics, CEE, and Turkey: Growth projections were revised upward marginally
for CEE and Turkey and downward slightly for the Baltic countries relative to the October 2014
REI. Continued labor market improvements will support private-consumption-led growth in
Baltic countries dented by spillovers from Russia. More favorable external developments will
contribute to a slight upward growth revision in CEE. Turkey will benefit from lower oil prices,
although somewhat countered by reduced export demand from Iraq, tighter fiscal policy, and
weaker consumer confidence.



Sluggish growth in SEE: Growth projections have been revised downward by 0.4 percentage
point for the SEE subregion relative to the October 2014 REI. Slower-than-expected
reconstruction after floods and a less supportive fiscal stance are expected to outweigh a
modest boost from lower oil prices and slightly better euro area growth. These economies
continue to struggle with high debt and are lagging the Baltics (which saw similarly strong
investment in the precrisis boom) with respect to deleveraging (Chapter II).



Recession in CIS countries: All CIS economies are expected to contract in 2015: Russia and
Ukraine are expected to face the largest drop in output. Large downward revisions in Russia and
Ukraine reflect the fallout from geopolitical tensions, ongoing macroeconomic adjustment, and
in Russia’s case, lower oil prices and a loss of confidence. Growth projections for Belarus and
Moldova have also been revised downward by about 4½ percentage points for 2015 relative to
the October 2014 REI.

Most CESEE countries outside the CIS will continue to grapple with downward price pressure
in 2015. Lower oil prices and downward inflation revisions in the euro area have significantly
dampened the inflation outlook not only in CEE and SEE, but also in Turkey, although it is somewhat
countered by the lira depreciation and monetary easing. Persistently lower prices and economic
slack have also increased the risk of second-round effects in EU members through lower wages,
which could entrench deflation pressure (Box 1). In contrast, inflation in Russia is projected to stay
above the central bank’s target during 2015–16; projections have also been revised upward for other
CIS countries as a result of the exchange rate depreciation pass-through and inflation inertia.

protracted period of slower growth in the euro area still cloud the outlook for CESEE countries.
Staff simulations show that a deeper contraction of activities in Russia could result in a fall in
GDP level between 0.1-3 percent relative to the baseline, with the CIS countries feeling the
largest impact (text chart above). If the situation in Greece were to deteriorate, it could cause
negative spillovers on Balkan countries where Greek subsidiaries account for a sizable part of the
banking system (see Box 3).
Box 3. SEE Links with Greece
Some SEE countries may be affected by a worsening situation in Greece through banking links.
Financial links between Greece and SEE economies are more significant than trade channels:



Trade linkages: The share of exports to Greece relative to GDP is fairly small in SEE countries, with the
highest exposure in Bulgaria, at 3.5 percent of GDP. This share has declined since 2008, reflecting
weaknesses in the Greek economy (see figure below).



Financial linkages: The banking sector exposure—though weaker than at the beginning of the financial
crisis—is still significant in a number of countries. SEE subsidiaries of Greek banks account for 14 to 22
percent of banking sector assets (see figure below). The loan-to-deposit ratios in Greek subsidiaries have
also declined over time, reflecting weak domestic demand for loans and less reliance on parent bank
funding. Higher nonperforming loans in some subsidiaries, however, pose additional risks.

If the situation in Greece gets worse, it could cause spillovers to the financial sectors of some SEE countries
through a loss of confidence, deposit outflows, and possibly pressure on the currencies—particularly in
countries with pegged exchange rate regimes and high euroization.



Since the October 2014 REI, some upside risks have emerged. The ECB’s QE could produce
stronger and more sustained gains in growth in the euro area, with positive spillovers to the
region. In addition, it could trigger larger-than-expected capital inflows, particularly for CESEE
countries with stronger fundamentals and more developed domestic debt and equity markets.
Similarly, recent declines in oil prices could support domestic demand more than envisaged,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

CESEE REI SPRING 2015

lifting CESEE growth above current projections. However, given large uncertainty regarding the
future path of oil prices and its drivers, this upside risk is somewhat balanced by downside risk
of an earlier-than-expected rebound in oil prices.
The following table highlights the key downside risks and the IMF staff’s assessment of the relative
likelihood and impact of these risks on the region.

II.

CENTRAL, EASTERN, AND SOUTHEASTERN
EUROPE: WEIGHED DOWN BY DEBT OR TURNING
THE CREDIT CYCLE?

CESEE countries have undergone a process of financial deepening since the early 1990s. This
process was facilitated by sizable capital inflows, which helped fund the rapid growth in credit,
consumption, and investment and led to widening current account deficits and a buildup of external
debt (Figure 1). Much of this debt was in the form of loans from western European banks and
intercompany loans.4 From 2003 onward, the credit deepening in some CESEE countries morphed
into increasingly unsustainable credit booms.
The 2008–09 global financial crisis triggered a sudden stop in capital inflows, causing sizable
current account adjustments across the region. As a result, credit growth came to a halt, and
domestic demand collapsed. Investment rates, in particular, plummeted across the region in the
wake of the crisis, except in Russia (Figure 1).
Investment rates have, since, remained weak despite supportive macroconomic policies. On
the one hand, the precrisis boom in many instances resulted in overinvestment, particularly in real
estate. On the other hand, private sector balance sheets became overextened in the run-up to the
crisis, and the sharp drop in incomes and asset prices, together with the rise in risk premiums in the
immediate aftermath of the crisis, made private debt unsustainable. This forced companies to curtail
borrowing and thus to shelve investment. Households needed to do the same with respect to
durables consumption and housing investment. At the same time, external demand slumped, and
negative feedback loops pushed the region into a deep recession.
The question now is to what extent weak corporate and household balance sheets still hold
back the recovery in CESEE. To answer this question, this chapter studies the post-2008 adjustment
in private non–financial sector debt and its impact on economic activity. The analysis is structured as
follows: Section A asks how much private sector deleveraging has already taken place across the
region; Section B aims to gauge the real cost of private sector deleveraging; Section C reviews the
remaining debt-related risks facing CESEE countries; Section D examines the dynamics of the
fundamental determinants of private credit to estimate remaining credit gaps between the level of
private debt and its secular trend and between the growth rate of private credit and its typical path
over the credit cycle; Section E concludes by considering how the countries that are still suffering
from debt overhang (that is, with positive credit gaps) can grow out of the debt problem over the
medium term.

A. How Much Deleveraging?
Despite significant deleveraging efforts—as measured by the adjustment in the private sector net
saving-investment balances—relatively few of the countries with a sizable buildup of debt before the
crisis managed to noticeably reduce their private-debt-to-GDP ratios after the crisis.
Figure 2. CESEE: Change in Private-Debt-to-GDP Ratios
before and after 2008–09 Crisis
Change in private debt-to-GDP between 2008 and 2013 (ppt)

A larger stock of private sector debt has
generally entailed larger deleveraging in
the aftermath of the crisis. A comparison of
the changes in private-debt-to-GDP ratios
during 2003–08 and 2008–13 shows that
countries that reduced their debt-to-GDP
ratios between 2008 and 2013 were among
those that experienced a significant buildup
of debt in the precrisis period—at least a
30 percentage point of GDP increase between
2003 and 2008 (Figure 2). However, not all
high-debt countries managed to bring down
their debt-to-GDP ratios. Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania,
and Ukraine, whose private-debt-to-GDP
ratios in 2008 were well above 2003 levels,
subsequently stabilized at their peak values or
increased further.

Since 2008–09, most CESEE countries have undergone significant correction of private sector
net saving-investment balances. When an economy is hit by a sudden stop, the correction of the
debt metrics typically occurs through reductions in consumption, implying higher saving and/or
cutbacks in investment. Indeed, the economy-wide net saving-investment balances improved
notably in much of the region (Figure 3).5 In some cases, large adjustments transformed the private
sector from a net borrower to a net creditor. The corrections were largest in exchange-rate-targeting
CESEE countries, where the precrisis external imbalances were among the biggest, and in Hungary.6

5

For the economy as a whole, domestic sectors’ net lending/borrowing is equal to the sum of current and capital
account balances, except for statistical discrepancies. The net lending (+)/net borrowing (-) broadly equals gross
saving and net capital transfers minus gross capital formation (that is, saving-investment balance). When positive, it
captures the excess savings that go toward principal debt repayment and asset accumulation. By construction, this
measure does not capture “automatic” savings generated by revaluation effects on assets, which are recorded
directly in the financial accounts.
6

In Hungary, the postcrisis depreciation of the forint exacerbated the burden of the foreign-exchange-denominated
debt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

CESEE REI SPRING 2015

In addition, in all CESEE countries except Belarus, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and
Russia, the adjustment was achieved in part by large declines in the private sector investment rate.

foreign-exchange-denominated liabilities experienced an increase in their debt burdens in the
immediate aftermath of the crisis due to valuation effects. For example, foreign exchange
devaluations have increased the debt burdens for households in Hungary and Poland (Figure
6b). Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine, which have significant debt exposures in U.S. dollars, were also
affected by exchange rate depreciation—but later on, in 2014. On the other hand, write-offs or
restructuring of debt has lowered debt burdens in some cases. Available data for EU CESEE show
that debt restructuring was applied more widely in the case of corporate than household loans.
The biggest declines in corporate debt burdens attributable to revaluations and reclassifications
were in Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovenia (Figure 6a).7 Households benefited the
most in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Romania, and the Slovak Republic (Figure 6b).


Inflation: Higher inflation (growth of GDP deflator) helped bring down debt-to-GDP ratios in
some countries (Figure 5).



Growth: Real incomes facilitated reductions in the debt-to-GDP metrics to a lesser extent,
reflecting the severity of the 2009 contractions and the weakness of subsequent recoveries
(Figure 5). In some countries, stronger external demand helped lower their private-debt-to-GDP
ratios in the postcrisis period (see Section B).

In the case of Bulgaria, the recorded revaluation and reclassification effects are mostly on account of the closure of

Private debt reductions reflected declines in both household and corporate debt. In the Baltics,
Hungary, and Ukraine, a significant share of the adjustment was carried out by households, while
corporate debt stocks were reduced in Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Serbia, and Slovenia (Figure 7).
Within corporate debt, intercompany loans from abroad have fallen only in a few countries,
reflecting the fact that such loans are typically more stable, but also that they are disproportionately
affected by valuation effects from depreciation of floating currencies.

Firm-level data show that among continuously reporting viable firms, those with relatively
higher leverage experienced the largest postcrisis adjustment (Figure 8):8

Among viable firms, the most indebted have undertaken the largest adjustments. Nonviable firms
had much higher median leverage in 2008 than continuously operating viable firms and in most
cases ceased operations or reported irregularly in subsequent years. Nonviable firms accounted
for about 10 percent of total sales of firms in the sample.

The analysis is based on a sample of firms that had non-zero debt in 2008 and continuously operated as viable
entities (with nonnegative equity) during 2008–13. Given data availability, the sample includes Bulgaria, Croatia, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Serbia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Turkey, and
Ukraine.

Note: Sample excludes firms that ceased operations or reported irregularly during 2008–12. These nonviable firms had excessive
leverage in 2008 and mostly closed down in subsequent years. Including these firms in 2008, the median leverage of the top 25
percent of firms by leverage would be close to 710 percent instead of the current 450 percent. The remaining quartiles would
remain practically unchanged. Industrial sectors are agriculture and mining (AG), manufacturing (MF), utilities (UT), construction and
real estate (CR), wholesale and retail trade (WR), and market services (MS). Size buckets are small, medium, and large.



Sectors dominated by small or highly leveraged firms deleveraged the most during 2009–12. The
wholesale-retail trade and market services sectors reduced their median debt-to-equity ratio by
close to 20 percentage points from 80-90 percent in 2008. Construction, manufacturing, and
agriculture have scaled back leverage by close to 10 percentage points. In contrast, leverage in
the utilities sector—which is dominated by larger and least indebted firms—did not change
much.



In countries with highly leveraged corporate sectors before the crisis, continuously operating viable
firms experienced the largest reduction in leverage during 2008–12. This was most notably the
case in the Baltics, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Ukraine. In contrast, in countries with
relatively low corporate leverage in 2008, such as the Czech Republic and Poland, firms reduced
leverage only slightly. Also consistent with the aggregate-level evidence (Figure 7b), the upleveraging by Turkish firms contrasts with the deleveraging trend in the rest of the region.

B. What Determines the Economic Cost of Deleveraging?
A smooth repair of private nonfinancial sector balance sheets—with minimal output losses—requires
supportive macroeconomic policies and flexible institutions. The scale of debt overhang, financial
sector resilience, and external environment matter as well. A less favorable combination of all these
factors, as in the case of SEE, would result in more protracted private sector deleveraging, with higher
real costs for the economy.
The repair of private balance sheets may take longer and entail larger output losses if


The debt overhang is pervasive: If both firms and households are highly leveraged, the
adjustment will likely be more difficult and/or more protracted.



Macroeconomic policies are not sufficiently supportive: the private sector balance sheet
adjustment could deepen the economic downturn if the government does not have fiscal space
to accommodate private sector deleveraging and/or if the central bank lacks monetary policy
space or flexibility to counter deflationary forces.



Institutions are not sufficiently flexible: A lack of efficient debt-resolution frameworks would make
it more difficult for firms and households to deal with the debt stock problem and make a fresh
start. In addition, more rigid labor market regulations (such as high hiring and firing costs) would
prevent firms from carrying out necessary labor shedding, thereby forcing them to
disproportionately cut back on investment, which could further delay the recovery in corporate
profitability and dampen growth prospects.



The financial sector is not sufficiently resilient: This means that banks are less able to absorb
losses stemming from nonperforming loan exposures and to facilitate debt restructuring.



External demand is weak: This happens if many countries must adjust at the same time.

Corporate Debt Overhang and Financial Accelerator
The extent of balance sheet weaknesses determines the impact of corporate deleveraging on
the economy. In response to falling demand, firms adjust production and costs to maintain
profitability and reduce payouts to shareholders in order to be able to service debt and protect
equity. Besides cutting investment and wage costs, they also sell off assets, particularly inventories
and noncore fixed assets. As firms demand fewer inputs for their new lower production, they need
less working and investment capital, leading to net repayment of debt. The intensity of the financial
accelerator depends on the prevalence of balance sheet weaknesses that can increase firms’
sensitivity to demand, income, and interest rate shocks (Bernanke and Gertler, 1989).
For a given decline in sales, more leveraged firms tend to react with larger cutbacks in
employment and investment. As a result, the greater the share of overleveraged firms the larger
the overall decline in aggregate demand. Figure 9 shows the average sensitivity of employment and
investment of firms in different CESEE countries to a 10 percent decline in sales. In countries with
larger corporate sector debt-to-GDP ratios, investment declines, on average, were larger than in
other countries for a given shock to sales or demand.9 Our analysis also confirms that for a given
decline in sales, more leveraged and/or smaller firms across CESEE countries tended to react by
relatively larger cutbacks in employment and investment (see Box 4).

The firm-level investment analysis for CESEE implies the elasticity of investment to GDP growth in the range of 1.6
to 2.5, which is similar to the elasticity range estimated for advanced economies (see Annex Table 4.3.1 in the April
2015 World Economic Outlook).

Box 4. Firm-Level Analysis of Adjustment in Response to Aggregate Shock
For a given decline in sales, more leveraged and/or smaller firms tend to react with relatively larger cutbacks in
employment and investment (see Annex VII, Table 3, for details):



The adjustment is larger in more leveraged firms. Such firms have lower free cash flow buffers and thus
tend to be more sensitive to declining demand than less leveraged firms. This is in line with the evidence
in studies for the United States and Canada (Sharpe, 1994; Heisz and LaRochelle-Côté, 2004). In the case
of investment, when testing determinants of the standard investment intensity, leverage appears to have
negatively affected investment in the aftermath of the 2008–09 crisis, but was not statistically significant
before the crisis (Annex VIII, Table 4). This is similar to findings that firms’ financial positions affected
investment in the euro area in the aftermath of the crisis (Martinez-Carrascal and Ferrando, 2008; Goretti
and Souto, 2013).



The adjustment is larger in smaller firms. This is in line with the findings in the literature that larger
manufacturing firms tend to hoard labor (Fay and Medoff, 1985; Sharpe, 1994) and that small firms are
less able than large firms to adjust by selling fixed assets (Heisz and LaRochelle-Côté, 2004) when they
face declining sales. Highly leveraged small firms tend to cut back investment disproportionately more
than employment.

Large-scale repair of corporate balance sheets complicates deleveraging efforts of
households, with negative feedback effects on firms. To put it simply, as firms cut back
investment and fire workers, they depress household income, which weakens household debt
metrics. This lowers consumption, in turn further weakening firms’ balance sheets. Analysis based on
sectoral accounts for CEE EU countries confirms that reductions in wages and salaries paid by firms
have eroded incomes of households, except in Bulgaria and Slovenia, likely undoing much of the
effect of higher corporate savings on firms’ balance sheets (See Annex VI). When debt overhang
afflicts both corporate and household sectors, the adjustment is even more painful.

The lack of flexible institutions could amplify

Labor markets: Countries with more flexible

have bigger adjustments in their savingsinvestment balances (Figure 11). Using firmlevel data, we are able to show that firms in
countries with more flexible hiring and firing
labor codes adjust more in economic
downturns and upturns (see Annex VII for
details). The results further expose the tradeoff facing small and medium enterprises
(SMEs), in particular between the investment
and labor adjustment—greater labor market

larger adjustment in employment but smaller adjustment in investment.
Debt-resolution framework: Weaknesses in the debt-resolution framework mean that firms are
less able to address the debt stock problem, which would also affect the overall economic cost
of adjustment. SMEs, in particular, face a number of unique challenges, including lack or
inadequacy of a fresh start and high fixed restructuring costs.11



Financial Sector Resilience
Stronger balance sheets put banks in a better position to absorb losses and facilitate
reallocation of credit to healthy sectors of the economy. Given the size of the 2008–09 shock
and the depth of subsequent recessions, many CESEE banking systems were saddled with sizable
nonperforming loans. The share of these loans in total loans rose above 10 percent in many CESEE
countries and even exceeded 20 percent in some cases (Figure 12a). The need for increasingly larger
provisions amid the lack of loan growth has further undermined banks’ profitability, thereby
reducing their capacity and willingness to lend and to facilitate restructuring of non–financial sector
balance sheets (Figure 12a). Furthermore, many of the euro area cross-border banking groups with
operations in CESEE tended to have overall weaker balance sheets than their peers, reflecting asset
quality deterioration both at home and abroad (Figure 12b), and they were therefore less able to
support their subsidiaries in CESEE.

External Environment
Having strong trade and financial links with countries that were less affected by the crisis helped
some CESEE countries in their postcrisis adjustment. Notably, the growth rates of trading partners
during 2008-14 tended to be higher for the Baltics than for the SEE countries (Figure 13a). Also, the
Baltics benefited from the presence of Nordic banks that had relatively stronger balance sheets than
many of the euro area banks (Figure 13b).

To sum up: given the large size of private debt before the global financial crisis, some of the Baltic
and SEE economies faced significant deleveraging pressure, which was partly offset by fiscal
accommodation (as many of these countries lacked monetary policy flexibility). In contrast with SEE
countries, the Baltic countries were able to adjust faster, resulting in a quicker recovery in investment
and economic activity (see Figure 1). This appears to have been largely due to their more flexible
institutions, but also to strong trade and financial links with countries that were in better shape in
the aftermath of the crisis.

C. What Are the Remaining Debt-Related Risks Facing CESEE?
A more granular analysis of aggregate and firm-level data suggests that debt-related risks remain
elevated in some corporate sectors (notably in Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, and Ukraine) and in some
industries (notably, construction and real estate).
Aggregate Debt Risk Metrics
The postcrisis adjustment has helped put external debt on a more sustainable path across
most countries. Based on the IMF staff’s external debt sustainability assessments, only in Belarus,

ratios (Figure 14). External debt developments reflect
12

both public and private balance sheet adjustment.
On aggregate, private-sector-debt-related risks are
now lower. The EU Macroeconomic Imbalances
Procedure (MIP) monitors economy-wide exposure to
debt-related risks by comparing the ratio of private sector
debt to GDP with the cutoff point of the top quartile of
the EU-wide distribution over 1995–2007 (EC, 2012). By
this metric, only Bulgaria breaches the MIP indicative
threshold of 133 percent of GDP.13
But sector-level risk metrics for CEE countries reveal
some weaknesses.14 CEE countries with the highest
number of sectoral debt risk metrics exceeding the cutoff
points of the top quartile of their precrisis EU-wide
distributions include Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Slovenia,
and the Slovak Republic (Figure 15; see Iossifov and
Zumer (2015) for details).



Liquidity risk—measured by debt-to-income and interest-expense-to-income ratios—reflects the
potential inability of borrowers to service debt obligations out of their current income.
Corporate liquidity risks are high in Bulgaria and Slovenia.



Solvency risk—proxied by the debt-to-equity ratio—measures the potential inability of borrowers
to keep the value of their assets above that of liabilities. Solvency risks are elevated in the
corporate sectors of Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, and Slovenia as well as for households in Croatia,
Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. CEE countries perform relatively worse on
solvency- than on liquidity-debt-risk metrics in EU-wide comparisons, signaling that the gap
between their sectoral net worth levels and that of the euro area is wider than the respective
gap in incomes.

Bulgaria and Estonia. The last column shows the latest available data (2012 data for Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, and

13

The level of indebtedness of the corporate sector in Bulgaria may be overestimated by the risk metrics, as a large
share of it is attributed to intercompany lending in the form of foreign direct investment, which is often used in tax
optimization strategies. Bulgaria’s corporate tax rate is the lowest in the European Union.



The risk of unfavorable debt dynamics—measured by the interest rate–income growth
differential—reflects the likelihood that debt may be put on an unsustainable path relative to
income. This metric has been above the cutoff point of the top quartile of its precrisis EU-wide
distribution in the corporate sectors of the Czech Republic, Romania, and Slovenia, as well as for
households in all CEE countries except Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland. On one hand, this reflects
the steep declines in household incomes and their relatively slow recovery across CEE (except in
Poland), which more than offset the positive effect of the postcrisis decline in nominal interest
rates. On the other hand, it captures the generally higher country risk premiums of CEE
countries, compared with other non-euro-area EU countries and nonstressed euro area
countries.

The debt-related risks are interlinked through negative macro-financial feedback loops.
Negative real shocks erode the debt-servicing capacity of firms and households, increasing their
exposure to liquidity risk. The slower income growth and higher demand for liquidity can then result
in an increase in the risk to autonomous debt dynamics, as the interest rate—–income growth
differential widens. Lower disposable incomes and higher interest rates can, in turn, trigger deflation
of asset price bubbles, eroding sectoral net worth and raising solvency risks.

Firm-Level Risk Metrics15
Firm-level analysis shows a broadly similar picture of debt-related risks for CESEE firms
(Figure 16). Both flag solvency risks for firms in Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, and Slovenia. In addition,
the average solvency-risk metrics constructed from firm-level data (average debt-to-equity ratios)
for Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey are also elevated, being above the 2013 average across sample
countries. Using the same criterion, firm-level data suggest high liquidity risk in the corporate
sectors of Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Ukraine.
Furthermore, corporate data shed light on risk concentrations that could exacerbate debtrelated weaknesses. The concept that is often used to assess risk concentration is debt-at-risk.
Debt-at-risk is defined as the share of debt owed by the most vulnerable firms. We identify
vulnerable firms as those that are facing high solvency risks, as measured by the debt-to-equity
ratio, or those facing high liquidity risks, as measured by debt-to-income (debt-to-EBIT [earnings
before interest and taxes] in the firm-level data) and interest coverage ratio (ICR). The debt-at-risk

15

The analysis in this section is based on firm-level data from the ORBIS database for all CESEE countries except
Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, and Montenegro (due to insufficient
data). While caution should be exercised in deriving conclusions based on aggregation of firm-level data, the ORBIS
data set generally has good coverage—total debt owed by the firms in the sample on average accounts for 35
percent of total corporate sector debt as recorded in national statistics. See Annex V for details.

Note: For aggregate-level data, debt to income is the ratio of stock of debt to gross disposable income, and debt to equity is the
ratio of stock of debt to firms’ equity. For better compatibility between sectoral and firm-level data, debt stock data are
unconsolidated within the corporate sector and no adjustments are made to gross disposable income, which is different from the
construction of sectoral risk metrics in Figure 15. The aggregate-level gross disposable income data for Bulgaria, Poland, and
Romania are available only until 2012. For firm-level data, debt to income is the ratio of firms’ total financial debt to earnings before
interest and taxes, and debt to equity is the ratio of firms’ total financial debt to shareholders’ funds. Firm-level data refer to the
weighted average of all firms covered in ORBIS. ORBIS data for Serbia do not include firms reporting negative equity. ICR = interest
coverage ratio.

thresholds are based on statistical data analysis and firm-level credit risk studies.16 The share of
debt-at-risk in total debt based on the ICR exceeds 40 percent in most CESEE countries and in some
cases is higher than 50 percent. This is comparable to, or higher than, the level in Portugal and Spain
in 2008-2009, and much higher than around 20 percent in Germany and France (see the IMF’s
October 2013 Global Financial Stability Report).
The debt-at-risk analysis reveals relatively high risk concentration in some countries,
including some that are not flagged based on aggregate data (Figure 16):


Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Ukraine have a relatively larger share than
other CESEE countries of debt concentrated in firms with elevated liquidity risk, based on
available firm-level data;



Croatia, Latvia, Russia, and Ukraine show the largest share of debt concentrated in firms with
elevated solvency risk, including a significant share of debt owed by firms with negative equity.



In countries with high debt-at-risk, risks tend to be more acute in SMEs and certain industries (for
example, construction and real estate—see Box 5.)

To sum up, risks stemming from corporate sector indebtedness appear elevated in a number of
countries, based on available aggregate and firm-level data:

The cutoff values are generally chosen in reference to the distributions of the financial ratios across all countries.
The debt-at-risk calculated using the debt-to-equity ratio refers to the share of debt owed by firms with a debt-toequity ratio below zero or above 5. The debt-at-risk using the debt-to-income ratio refers to the share of debt owed
by firms with a debt-to-EBIT ratio below zero or above 8. These thresholds are approximately equal to the cutoff
values of the 95th percentile of the distributions of the ratios across all sample countries. The threshold for the ICR is
1, which is widely used in financial analysis, and it corresponds approximately to the cutoff value of the 30th
percentile of the ICR distribution.

Box 5. Firm-Level Analysis of Debt-at-Risk of CESEE firms by Industry and Firm Size
Risks tend to be more acute in certain sectors and size groups:
 The construction and real estate as well as market services sectors in most countries exhibit a relatively high
concentration of debt in the most vulnerable firms. Even in countries with relatively modest overall debt-atrisk, such as Poland, these two sectors tend to exhibit high risk concentration.



Debt-at-risk is generally higher among small and medium enterprises than among large firms. This is
particularly true for solvency risk, because small and medium firms tend to have less equity than large firms.
Hungary and Poland appear to be exceptions, showing higher debt-at-risk levels among larger firms in the
sample.17

D. What Are the Remaining Credit Gaps across CESEE?
Postcrisis deleveraging has not been sufficient to align private debt with its fundamentals in a number
of CESEE countries, suggesting further adjustment in the years ahead that will continue to weigh on
growth.
What are the remaining credit gaps across CESEE? To answer this question, we compare the
current level of private sector debt to a time-varying benchmark derived from the estimated longterm relationship between private sector debt and its fundamental determinants.18 Under this
approach, CESEE countries can be grouped into four classes, based on the combinations of positive
or negative credit gaps between the current level of private debt and its secular trend and between
the growth rate of private credit and its rate implied by the model (Figure 17 and Annex IV).

This is done using data for 36 European countries for 1995–2013. Annex IV presents the results of the estimation of
the stylized, reduced-form, demand and supply system for private sector debt. Explanatory variables include per
capita GDP (in purchasing-power-parity U.S. dollars) as a proxy for debt-servicing capacity that positively affects both
the demand for and supply of debt and the nominal interest rate on private debt, which has a negative effect on
demand and a positive effect on supply. The model also includes country-specific constants that may reflect
differences in the quality of institutions across countries, as well as other country-specific factors.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CESEE REI SPRING 2015

The analysis suggests that postcrisis deleveraging has not been sufficient to align private debt
with its fundamentals in a number of CESEE countries. As of 2013, countries with positive credit
gaps (that is, where private debt exceeds the model-based values)19—though with a rate of growth
below the speed of adjustment predicted by the model—include Bulgaria, Croatia, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Romania. At the same time, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine stand
out with debt above the level consistent with fundamentals and growth of debt higher than
predicted by the short-term dynamics of the model. In the model, the debt overhangs weigh on
credit growth because positive credit gaps must be gradually closed through reduction in debt
stocks (Annex IV). One important caveat is that the model assumes the credit gap to be zero, on
average over the sample period (1995–2013) in each country. In reality, it is possible that the initial
debt levels were already too high in some cases. A comparison between country-specific constants
and the fitted trend line with these countries’ relative institutional strength suggests that in some
cases debt levels are indeed notably higher than one would expect given their institutional quality
(see Annex IV for details).
Recovery in corporate sector profitability tends to lead recovery in GDP growth. Rising
profitability encourages investing, hiring, and borrowing and thus accelerates domestic-demanddriven growth. Borrowing increases leverage, which boosts profitability further and strengthens the
upturn in the business cycle. The upturn phase lasts until growth and borrowing reach unsustainable
levels. Then profitability starts to weaken and the economy cools down (Figure 18). The analysis of
quarterly national accounts data for the CESEE EU countries during 2005–14 shows that in the
current cycle, net leverage above 40 percent signals the need for adjustment.
Further balance sheet adjustment is needed to create conditions for resumption of the new
credit cycle. Although the region as a whole shows signs of turning a corner, in many instances
legacy debt burdens remain above their fundamentals-consistent values (Figure 17), acting as a drag
on credit growth. Some CEE EU countries appear to have entered a phase of so-called economic
bounce-back (McKinsey Global Institute, 2012), characterized by leverage reduced to levels that
would allow resumption of credit, investment and output growth. Countries with lower levels of
corporate leverage already see some positive credit growth, while credit continues to fall where
leverage is still high (Figure 19, right panel). For others, past episodes of deleveraging (Tang and
Upper, 2010) seem to suggest that deleveraging may continue through real growth and inflation
over a number of years, with real credit gradually growing again—but by less than the equity gains
from improved profitability (Figure 19, left panel).

19

Defined as private debt overhang in excess of 10 percent of GDP, which is also the threshold for statistical
significance. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed the same threshold, as a trigger for a
countercyclical capital buffer add-on, but based on the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its long-term trend
(BCBS, 2010). The regression analysis in Annex IV develops this concept further by using only the component of the
long-term trend that can be explained by developments in the fundamental determinants of private debt.

CESEE REI SPRING 2015

To sum up, private sector balance sheet repair is not yet complete in some CESEE countries:


Bulgaria, Croatia, and Ukraine stand out as requiring further adjustment in order for credit and
investment growth to resume; in Latvia and Slovenia corporate sector risks remain elevated
despite progress in recent years. Romania also had a large positive credit gap in 2011, but this
gap has likely narrowed since then on the back of monetary policy easing, strong performance,
and efforts to facilitate debt restructuring through sales of nonperforming loans, write-offs, and
higher provisioning.



Belarus, Russia, and Turkey are in the upswing of the credit cycle, which raises the risk that
balance sheets may become overextended. Similar risk exists in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia as well.



Other CESEE countries appear better positioned for an upturn in the credit cycle.

Consistent with this assessment, credit developments during 2014 show a robust pickup in credit
growth only in CEE countries. At the same time, CIS countries were facing tighter financing
conditions, and experienced significant deceleration of corporate credit growth throughout 2014
(Figure 20).

How Can CESEE Countries Grow out of Debt?

Growing out of debt may be challenging for some SEE and CIS countries without major structural
reforms.
Over the medium term, growth is projected to remain at about half of its precrisis potential,
slightly below 2½ percent in the CESEE region. While labor markets in CESEE countries have seen
considerable improvement (see Chapter I), limited support from improving labor market conditions
for a consumption-driven recovery may well become increasingly evident, if investment does not
rebound or reforms do not tackle low productivity and structural unemployment. A comparison with
OECD countries shows that CESEE countries, particularly those in SEE and the CIS, are below the 25th
percentile in many key areas of structural reform, including of labor markets (Figure 22).

Growing out of the debt problem will likely remain a challenge for some CESEE countries.
Simulation of the gap between actual and long-term, fundamentals-consistent values of private
sector debt in 2020—carried out by dividing the 2013 gap between actual and fundamentalsconsistent values of private debt by the IMF’s 2015 April World Economic Outlook forecast for
nominal GDP in 2020—suggests that absent a policy response, the debt burden will remain a drag
on credit and by extension on domestic demand in Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia, and Romania, as well as in Turkey and Ukraine (Figure 21). In other countries,
especially those where growth has picked up recently, the private sector is in a better position to
grow out of the debt problems.

III. POLICY PRIORITIES
Supporting domestic demand and completing the repair of private sector balance sheets are the key
near-term priorities.
Despite some progress, the repair of private sector balance sheets remains a work in progress
in several CESEE countries. While most countries improved saving-investment balances, the
accompanying reduction in absorption has eroded national incomes, only marginally lowering
private-debt-to-GDP ratios. In some cases, the debt-related problems are pervasive, afflicting both
firms and households, while policy space to accommodate private sector deleveraging is limited,
further complicating and raising the economic cost of the adjustment process.
Macroeconomic developments may pose new challenges for balance sheet repair:


Low inflation—driven by falling world oil prices—has boosted households’ purchasing power,
freeing up funds for debt service. But persistent disinflation and particularly deflation can
complicate the process of deleveraging by heavily indebted firms and households, because it
increases their real debt burden.



Tightening of global financial conditions (for example, as the United States begins to normalize
its monetary policy) are also a downside risk to debt dynamics, particularly for countries with
large participation by nonresidents in domestic financial markets, large external and/or shortterm and/or U.S. dollar–denominated debt. However, to the extent that they accompany higher
U.S. and euro area growth, the effects on funding costs will be mitigated by better prospects for
exports.

Macroeconomic policies should be mindful of the credit gaps. Countries whose private debt
does not exceed a level consistent with fundamentals (for example, in CEE) are well positioned for
balanced growth, with positive contributions from both investment and consumption. In the rest of
the region, debt-related risks may continue to weigh on demand, and supportive macroeconomic
policies are therefore essential. Among CESEE countries still afflicted with private debt overhang and
subpar credit growth, the Bulgarian, Croatian, and Slovenian economies are exhibiting symptoms of
balance sheet stagnation. The economies of Latvia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and
Romania are more dynamic, but may still need to do more to complete balance sheet repair in order
to ensure robust recovery and resumption of income convergence. Ukraine is currently in the
process of restructuring of privately held external debt.
Fiscal consolidation, while needed in many CESEE countries, should not derail the recovery. In
the aftermath of the crisis, many governments helped accommodate the deleveraging of firms and
households. The flip side was a significant increase in public debt levels, which now need to be
brought back on a sustainable path in a number of countries, notably in Croatia, Serbia, and
Slovenia, (Figure 23a). Countries with high public debt levels have been pursuing fiscal consolidation
mostly via expenditure reductions. Yet further consolidation is needed for these countries to reach

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CESEE REI SPRING 2015

their medium-term fiscal targets (Figure 23b). In CEE and SEE, fiscal consolidation needs to be
mindful of the fragile recovery and could be partly offset by bringing forward public investment, as
envisaged in Poland and Romania, supported by higher absorption of EU funds. A tighter fiscal
stance in Turkey—in line with the new medium-term program—will contribute to a gradual
narrowing of external imbalances. In Russia, although fiscal consolidation would likely be required to
stabilize debt over the medium term, cyclical considerations and fiscal space permit some easing in
the short run.

Monetary policy should remain accommodative in countries facing deflation risks. Monetary
conditions are appropriately supporting recovery of domestic demand in CEE and SEE countries.
Additional policy action may be necessary to return inflation to target in inflation-targeting CESEE
countries, should inflation expectations continue to decline or interest-rate differentials widen,
resulting in unwarranted upward pressure on the exchange rate. In Turkey, further easing of
monetary conditions should only be considered once inflation expectations are well anchored and
real interest rates are firmly in positive territory. In Russia, the speed of monetary policy easing

should be tied to developments in core inflation and inflation expectations to ensure that inflation
will come down to target over the medium term.
Financial sector policies should encourage further strengthening of bank balance sheets and
ensure that banks have adequate capacity and incentives to deal with large stocks of NPLs. A
comprehensive strategy of dealing with NPLs and debt overhang would combine stricter supervisory
standards, reforms to speed insolvency procedures, and efforts to jump-start distressed debt
markets, where feasible. A robust debt-restructuring framework is particularly important for
countries where the stock of debt is high, institutional frameworks are weak, and current baseline
growth projections do not allow them to escape the debt overhang over the medium term (see
Figure 21 and Annex IV).

Labor Market Regulations, 2012
(Index, 10 = least restrictive)

Institutional reforms are critical to lifting potential growth and facilitating balance sheet
repair. Potential growth in the region is estimated to be half of what it was during the precrisis
years. To lift growth potential in light of much lower capital flows and aging populations, improving
productivity and competitiveness through deep structural reforms will be key. These include the
long-standing tasks of improving the

proportional to the ratio of private debt to GDP. The score shown on
the horizontal axis is an average of the two scores (enforcing
contracts and resolving insolvency).

For countries experiencing rapid credit
growth (for example, Turkey) further
targeted macroprudential policies could be considered to maintain the quality of credit, control
risk exposures, and ensure adequate capital to absorb potential losses. In Russia, macroprudential
measures taken in 2013 to curb unsecured consumer lending by increasing applicable risk weights
and provisioning requirements have cooled the credit boom. In addition, sizable external
deleveraging is already taking place in Russia amid sanctions and uncertainty surrounding
conditions for resumption of access to international capital markets.

Annex IV. Estimation of the Private Sector Debt Level Consistent with Fundamentals1
The relationship between private sector debt and its main determinants is cast as a single
equation, autoregressive-distributed lag (ADL) model. The latter can be interpreted as a stylized,
reduced-form, demand and supply system expressed in semi-loglinear form:
(1)
– Per capita private sector debt stock in thousands of 2005 purchasing-power-parity
U.S. dollars (see note to Figure 7 for details);
– Per capita GDP in thousands of 2005 purchasing-power-parity U.S. dollars (source:
IMF’s World Economic Outlook database), used as a measure of debt-servicing
capacity that affects positively (+) both the demand and supply of credit;
– nominal interest rate on private sector debt (fraction)2, which has opposite effects
on demand (-) and supply (+);
– country index, – time index.
The demand-side effect of changes in interest rates is expected to dominate the supply-side impact
in the reduced-form equation, in line with the findings in the existing literature (Cottarelli,
Dell’Ariccia, and Vladkova-Hollar, 2003; Schadler and others, 2005; Iossifov and Khamis, 2009). Lack
of data on private sector net worth for CESEE countries outside the EU prevents us from including
that variable in the regional regressions.
The long-run relationship between private sector debt and its main determinants is then
given by the long-run solution of the ADL model, under the stability condition (
, where

For EU countries, the implicit interest rate is calculated using sectoral accounts data as the ratio of interest
payments (including financial intermediation services indirectly measured) over the average of the beginning and
end-period combined stock of debt of firms and households. For other countries, data are mostly for the lending
rate, published in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics database, with gaps in country coverage filled with data
for the short-term interest rate published in the OECD’s Economic Outlook database and from national data sources.

All variables entering equation (2) are assumed to be either (trend) stationary or integrated of order
one and cointegrated (that is, there is a linear combination of the variables in levels that is
stationary). In the latter case, the long-run coefficients inferred from the short-run regression
specification lie in the cointegration space of the dependent and explanatory variables (Hendry,
1995).
The equilibrium-correction (EC) model isomorphic to the reduced-form demand and supply system
(1) is then given by:
(3)
Regression findings
The long-run relationship between private sector debt and its main determinants is estimated
with data for 36 European countries during 1995–2013.3 The use of a broad sample of European
countries is valid under the assumption that all countries share the same long-term elasticities with
respect to fundamentals. Restricting the sample to CESEE countries is not appropriate because it
increases the risk of contaminating the long-term equilibrium path with credit-boom dynamics. All
series are time demeaned by subtracting the mean across all countries in a given period from the
individual country values. This removes nuisance cross-sectional dependency that creates size
distortions and makes inference based on two-stage generalized method of moments (GMM)
estimates unreliable (Roodman, 2009). Exploratory data analysis suggests that all variables are panel
stationary.
The static and dynamic versions of equation (1) are evaluated using different estimation
methods (Table 1). Model 2 in Table 2 represents the full ADL model. The static and dynamic
regression specifications are first evaluated using pooled and within-group (fixed-effects) ordinary
least squares. While these estimators have the advantage of computational ease, both are
inconsistent in the presence of endogenous explanatory variables and/or a lagged dependent
variable. Therefore, in the final stage of analysis we use the Arellano-Bond dynamic-panel system
GMM estimator (GMM-SYS). It is consistent in these circumstances, with the caveat that its
asymptotic properties require a cross-sectional unit dimension of the data that is large relative to its
time dimension. The latter condition is only partially met in the case of European panel data studies.
Regression analysis confirms the importance of the identified demand and supply factors in
determining the path of the stock of private sector debt. The magnitudes of the coefficients of
real per capita GDP in purchasing-power-parity U.S. dollars and the nominal interest rate are sizable,
and their signs are consistent with theoretical priors (Table 1). The per capita debt stock exhibits a

Albania, Belarus, Iceland, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Norway, and Serbia are dropped from the sample, due to lack
of data or data free of major structural breaks for the typical duration of a full business cycle (eight years). For all
CESEE countries, data prior to 1998 are discarded, due to structural breaks in the early stage of transition.

the instruments used.5According to the Arellano-Bond dynamic-panel GMM estimates of
Model 2, the long-run relationship between private sector debt and its fundamentals is
(4)
Our preferred modeling approach is to include country-specific intercepts in the long-run
relationship, equation (4), and partially incorporate common time effects:


Country-specific intercepts—included to ensure that the actual series and their fundamentalsconsistent counterparts have the same means for each country in the sample.6 The underlying
assumption is that CESEE countries may not converge to a common equilibrium path from
different starting points. This is in line with the thesis in Barajas and others (2013) that countries
contend with different, constrained, optimum levels of financial development.



Common time effects—included but only to the extent that they can be explained by common
time effects in the right-hand variables. The underlying assumption is that the dynamics of
fundamentals have the same impact on the “equilibrium” debt burdens, whether or not they are
driven by common time effects or country idiosyncratic factors. This provides a midrange
estimate of the misalignment between actual private debt burdens and their long-run,
fundamentals-consistent values.7

Equation (4) can then be used to calculate the long-run, fundamentals-consistent values of
real per capita private sector debt in CESEE countries. Using equation (3), countries can be
further classified into four broad classes, depending on their positions relative to the secular trend in
private sector debt and the phase of the credit cycle:
1. Level of debt above its long-run value consistent with fundamentals and growth of debt higher
than predicted by the short-run dynamics of the model.
2. Level of debt above its long-run value consistent with fundamentals and growth of debt lower
than or close to the value predicted by the short-run dynamics of the model.
3. Level of debt below or close to its long-run value consistent with fundamentals and growth of
debt lower than or close to the value predicted by the short-run dynamics of the model.

5

As seen from the statistical insignificance at the 10 percent level of confidence of the Hansen test of overidentifying
restrictions (whether the instruments, as a group, appear exogenous).
6

The alternative is to use a common intercept for all sample countries.

7

The alternatives are to exclude the common time effects altogether or to fully include the common time effects in
the left-hand variable in its long-run equilibrium values.

4. Level of debt below or close to its long-run value consistent with fundamentals and growth of
debt higher than predicted by the short-run dynamics of the model.

However, other idiosyncratic effects
may be present as well. In particular, in
some cases the initial debt levels may be
higher than expected given the quality of
institutions in these countries. The
empirical relationship between the
country-specific intercepts and
institutional quality could be used to
separate the country-specific-level effects
unexplained by institutional quality. Then,
if the credit gaps obtained from the
regression analysis were adjusted to
include the country-specific-level effects
unexplained by institutional quality, the
credit gaps would be even larger in a
number of countries (see Figure 2). This
further underscores the importance of
structural reforms to increase countries’
capacity to support financial deepening.

Differences in Country-Specific-Level Effects in Private Debt
Regressions
Distance of Country Intercepts from Average Advanced
Europe Country Intercept in Private Debt Regression

Differences in country-specific
intercepts in the regression of private
debt may reflect differences in the
quality of institutions across countries,
as well as other country-specific
factors. This conjecture is indeed
supported by evidence, as countries with
weaker institutions (compared with the
euro area average) tend to have lower
country-specific constants (compared with
the euro area average), implying that they
would, on average, be expected to have
lower debt levels (see Figure 1). Thus, the
differences in country-specific intercepts
could be interpreted as capturing the
potential for further financial deepening
after controlling for differences in interest
rates and per capita incomes.

Annex V. Firm-Level Debt-at-Risk Analysis1
To examine the distribution of corporate sector debt, the analysis uses disaggregated, firmlevel annual data from the ORBIS database, covering about 2 million firms in 14 countries for
the period between 2008 and 2013. The coverage of sample firms for each country varies, but on
average total debt owed by sample firms accounts for about 35 percent of countries’ aggregate
corporate sector debt calculated using sectoral accounts.

3

Firms are classified as small, medium, or large, depending on their number of employees and the size of the total
balance sheet. The classification is based on the ceiling defined by ECB (2013): medium firms are defined as firms that
employ fewer than 250 people and whose annual balance sheet does not exceed 43 million euros; small firms are
firms that employ fewer than 50 people and whose annual balance sheet does not exceed 10 million euros.

1 All cash flows identified in the chart typically represent net outflows for corporates and as such a positive contribution to the saving rate signify a reduction in the corresponding
outlays. The net inflow is the gross value-added, which also appears in the denominator of the saving ratio and as such does not contribute to the percentage point difference in saving
rates before and after the crisis.
2 For households, positive cash flows typically are wages and salaries, self-employment income, net interest payments and other distributions. A positive contribution to the saving rate
by these inflows signify increase in the corresponding revenues. The share of indirect taxes paid by households is calculated as the ratio of household consumption to the sum of
household consumption and government consumption, the latter being net of compensation of employees.
3 Government's gross value added is measured as the sum of public sector wages and benefits and depreciation. Public sector wa ges and benefits are also part of government final
consumptions, with the two entries cancelling each other. Government's gross disposable income is equal to total revenues minus social benefits other than social transfers in kind.

Annex VII. Firm-level Analysis of Employment and Investment4
Following a large body of firm-level studies, we estimate the accelerator-style model. Such a
model was used by Cantor (1990), Sharpe (1994), Heisz and LaRochelle-Côté (2004), and ChodorowReich (2014) to test the procyclicality of firm-level employment and investment in relation to
differences in leverage and size of companies. In addition, we add a country-specific variable
measuring flexibility of hiring and firing labor market regulations and test its significance for an
average firm, and specifically for small firms. For a firm i in time t and country j, the whole model can
be expressed as follows:

The dependent variable Y is alternatively employment or investment. Investment is measured as a
change in fixed assets. S stands for sales; A for assets (measuring size); L is leverage (debt to total
assets); R is the index of flexibility of hiring and firing labor market regulation of the Fraser Institute’s
Economic Freedom of the World database; and D is a dummy variable equal to one if a firm has
fewer than 50 employees. Following the literature, the choice of the lag structure minimizes
endogeneity issues. The model is estimated using an Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data two-step
estimator with robust Windmeijer-adjusted standard errors. Residuals are assumed to be
independent and identically distributed.
Results suggest that leverage and size of firms as well as flexibility of hiring and firing
regulation influence firms’ responses to shocks in sales. According to the results in Table 3, firms
respond to falling sales by cutting employment and investment.


A 10 percent decline in sales calls for cost reductions between 2 and 4 percent (since value
added typically ranges between 30 and 50 percent of sales and profits account for a third of
value added) to restore profitability.



Firms of average size and leverage respond by about 2 percent, equally divided between
investment and employment. Small firms adjust more, and their response seems to be also
dependent on the degree of labor market flexibility, with more rigid regimes associated with
lower response of employment and greater in investment. For instance, small, low-leverage firms
in countries with relatively rigid labor regulation respond to a 10 percent decline in sales by
cutting employment by 1 percent and investment by 3 percent. Highly leveraged small firms in
countries with flexible labor codes reduce employment and investment by close to 2 percent

Dynamic panel regressions confirm the sensitivity of firms’ investment-to-capital ratio to
their debt overhang. Following the earlier literature, we estimate a specification for the investment
equation of the firm as follows:

where
is the investment-to-capital ratio of firm at time . The debt overhang or financial
pressure variable
is proxied by standard measures such as the debt-to-asset ratio or interestcoverage ratio. The latter is defined as the ratio of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) to
interest payments. We include the lagged cash-flow-to-capital ratio to control for standard salesaccelerator effects in such models. The coefficient measuring the sensitivity of investment to
balance sheet variables appears to be significant and with the correct sign (Table 4, columns 1,3).
