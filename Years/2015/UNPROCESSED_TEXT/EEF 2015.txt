FOREWORD
GDP growth in the EU remains sluggish. Sputtering investment has so far prevented a broader and more
robust acceleration of domestic demand. Amid challenging global conditions, the fall in crude oil prices
should provide a welcome boost to growth.
Several important shifts are under way in the global economy. Falling oil and commodity prices are
redistributing income from commodity-exporting countries to commodity-importing ones on a massive
scale. Strong GDP growth in the US has fuelled expectations of monetary-policy divergence among major
advanced economies, which has already provoked large adjustments in bilateral exchange rates. The
economic prospects of emerging markets are also diverging; and the factors that led to the extraordinary
growth of global trade in the early 2000s appear to have weakened.
The friction that occurs as these shifts take place creates a number of vulnerabilities in the global
economy. Financial asset prices continued to rise substantially in 2014 but appear vulnerable to a change
in risk appetite. The expected tightening of the US Fed’s monetary stance may trigger adjustments in
global capital flows. The resilience of commodity-exporting countries will be tested if commodity prices
remain low. Geopolitical risks have not abated. All in all, the global outlook is clouded by the risk that
economic prospects around the world will diverge further and by the potential for volatile incidents in
capital markets.
In the EU, slowly expanding private consumption has been the only constant growth driver since the start
of the recovery almost two years ago. Investment faltered in 2014 and remains weak. Longer-term trends
such as ageing and declining productivity growth may also have affected short-term investment decisions
by reducing expected rates of return. Against this backdrop, monetary accommodation and the shift of the
fiscal stance to neutral have so far not been enough to spur growth. Headline inflation has dropped,
largely on the back of lower energy prices, which should benefit growth by boosting real incomes.
However, inflation expectations for the medium-term have also declined, leading to an increase in real
interest rates. In the short run, downside risks have intensified, but new upside risks have also emerged.
In the longer run, are we facing an era of low growth, low investment, low inflation and the occasional
storm in global financial markets? Not if the right policies are implemented now with determination. The
ECB has just decided a programme of quantitative easing with strong forward guidance that is large
enough to stabilise inflation expectations and reduce real interest rates. The easing of the EU’s fiscal
policy stance from consolidation to neutral is appropriate for the EU as a whole, but the lack of
differentiation among countries reduces its benefits. Public finances would also be much more supportive
of long-term growth if expenditure were more focused on investment. The EU Investment Plan and the
Commission’s guidance on the application of the Stability and Growth Pact provide a framework that
must now be put into practice. Whether and how we reform our labour and product markets today will
determine our chances for resource-efficient growth in the long run. These policy areas are intertwined
and must be addressed simultaneously.
The recent sharp fall in oil prices should provide a welcome lift to the EU’s GDP growth in the short run.
But this blessing would turn into a curse if it diverted policy makers from the formidable challenges that
still lie ahead.

OVERVIEW
The recovery lacked
momentum in 2014…

The pace of the recovery remains slow as Europe continues to struggle to
leave the legacies of the crisis behind it. Economic growth remains also
weighed down by unfinished macroeconomic adjustment and sluggish
implementation of reforms, as well as long-standing weak growth trends.
Moreover, uncertainty about the geopolitical situation, commitments to future
policy initiatives and energy-price developments have gained importance in
2014. While private consumption has been the main engine of growth in the
current recovery, investment has failed to recover and exports have done little
to support growth. The economic recovery in the EU and the euro area is
therefore expected to have lacked momentum in 2014, with annual GDP
expected to have increased by respectively 1.3% and 0.8%.

…but new factors
brighten the near-term
outlook.

New developments have occurred that are expected to brighten in the near
term the EU's economic outlook that would otherwise have deteriorated since
the autumn. Oil prices have declined sharply, the euro has depreciated
noticeably, the ECB has decided to expand the size and composition of its
outright asset purchases by adding sovereign bond purchases, and the
European Commission has presented its Investment Plan.

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

The oil price fall should
stimulate activity...

The recent steep fall in oil prices should provide a boost to EU GDP growth
over the forecast horizon but will further depress headline inflation this year.
The decline in oil prices is substantial and market expectations suggest an
only gradual rebound. Lower oil prices over the forecast horizon are expected
to benefit EU real GDP growth by raising the real disposable income of
households and by widening corporates' profit margins. Higher real incomes
and profits should also help households and firms to service their debt and
continue deleveraging, provided that, as it is assumed in this forecast, the fall
in oil prices does not lead to second-round effects on income and wages and a
subsequent increase in the real debt burden. However, with nominal interest
rates close to zero, central banks have limited options to prevent an
unwarranted increase in real interest rates. This should mitigate the positive
impact of the oil price fall to some extent.

… additional
measures from the
ECB should
accelerate the
normalisation of
inflation…

Meanwhile, the ECB's quantitative easing appears large enough to have an
impact on macroeconomic developments. The strong signalling effect of its
announcement should support a re-anchoring of medium to long-term
inflation expectations which would dampen the rise of real interest rates
induced by lower inflation. This would facilitate further the deleveraging
process throughout the euro area, while also supporting credit demand. The
positive impact on confidence and credit growth should support domestic
investment activity and consumption and therefore contribute to the
normalisation of price developments.

… the euro
depreciation should
strengthen firms'
competitiveness…

Expectations that the direction of US monetary-policy will diverge from that
of the euro area, have had a strong impact on the euro exchange rate in recent
months. The depreciation of the euro's trade-weighted exchange rate should
strengthen price competitiveness of euro-area companies on foreign and
domestic markets this year and next and will also contribute to push inflation
higher in 2016.

…and some impetus
should come from the
EU Investment Plan, in
particular in 2016.

Finally, the EU Investment Plan should positively affect the growth outlook
by supporting investment, though its impact will mainly be felt in 2016 and
beyond.
The positive impact of each of these developments on EU growth has to be
seen against the backdrop of lingering adverse factors such as the remaining
need of balance-sheet adjustment, high unemployment rates, persistent
structural weaknesses and increased geopolitical concerns. Nevertheless,
they limit the risk of entering a long period of very low growth or stagnation.
On balance, as the legacy of the crisis gradually abates, the labour market
continues to improve and structural reforms implemented so far start bearing
fruit, an acceleration of GDP growth is expected this year and next.
Annual GDP growth in the EU is then forecast to accelerate to 1.7% this year
and 2.1% next year, while growth in the euro area is expected to pick up to
1.3% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016. The sharp fall in energy prices is expected to
lower headline inflation massively over the coming quarters, dragging
inflation in the EU and the euro area to just 0.2% and -0.1% respectively this
year. Price levels are then expected to bounce back somewhat next year by
1.4% in the EU and 1.3% in the euro area.

Overview

The fall in oil prices will
accentuate regional
growth differences in
the global economy…

After a slow start, global growth and world trade picked up over the course of
last year and are expected to accelerate moderately in 2015 and 2016, pushed
by a gradual recovery in advanced economies and some recovery from the
recent weakness in emerging markets.
The sharp drop in global oil prices should help underpin global growth but it
will also further accentuate regional differences as it implies a substantial
redistribution of income from oil exporters to oil importers with an overall
positive impact on global output growth. As an oil importer, the EU will
directly benefit from this redistribution. However, Member States whose
exports are more oriented towards commodity-exporting countries may feel a
slowdown of foreign demand growth.
In the US, real GDP growth, driven mainly by private consumption, gathered
considerable momentum over the course of 2014 and lower energy prices are
set to provide a further boost to the economy in 2015. At the same time,
while growth in Japan proved disappointing in 2014, it should benefit from
lower oil prices and renewed monetary easing this year and next. Among
emerging market economies, China also stands to gain from lower oil prices
and is expected to continue growing by about 7% this year while slowing
down to a more sustainable growth path as the economy rebalances. While
the outlook has improved for India, falling oil revenues and the plunging
rouble have pushed Russia to the brink of an economic and financial crisis.
The growth outlook for many other commodity-exporting countries in Latin
America and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has also
deteriorated. Global growth is expected to be 3.3% in 2014 and to accelerate
to 3.6% in 2015 and 4.0% in 2016.
World import growth is expected to rebound from 2.6% in 2014, to 4.3% in
2015 and 5.3% in 2016. The slight downward revision since the autumn,
mainly reflects a reassessment of the trade outlook in certain economies and
in the global trade elasticity, given that a combination of cyclical and
structural factors continue to act as drags on global trade flows. Trade
forecasts were revised down particularly for emerging markets, especially for
Russia, where the deepening recession and depreciating currency weighs
down on imports, and for China where the ongoing property market
correction and slower growth in investment have led to more sluggish
domestic demand and a more subdued trade outlook.

…while in the EU,
countries will continue
to grow at different
rates…

As of this year, and for the first time since the start of the crisis, GDP is
expected to grow in every country in the EU. However, diversity in economic
performance is likely to persist since the pace of reform implementation,
balance sheet adjustment and deleveraging among banks, the non-bank
corporate sector, households and the public sector continue to differ across
Member States. Some countries will benefit more than others from the fall in
oil prices, depending on the energy intensity of their economies and their
energy taxation systems.
Among the larger Member States, activity is forecast to be dynamic in
Poland, the UK and Spain with growth rates well above the EU average.
While Poland had been the only country exhibiting positive growth rates
during the financial crisis and thereafter, growth in the UK had been rather
strong already since the end of the financial crisis. Economic activity in
Spain is expected to pick up thanks to improved labour-market and easier
financing conditions. Economic growth in Germany is expected to be close
to the EU average in 2015 and 2016, supported by domestic demand. The

3

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

economy of France is expected to slowly gain momentum in 2015 and 2016,
as household consumption picks up but investment remains subdued. In Italy,
GDP growth is projected to turn positive early this year, as growing external
demand leads a fragile recovery. Despite some improvement in its housing
market, deleveraging pressures in the Netherlands will limit the potential for
a faster recovery. Among the euro-area Member States that had or have
adjustment programmes, growth is expected to remain robust in Ireland,
while the economy in Cyprus is showing signs of stabilisation. In Greece,
uncertainty about the direction of policies is affecting confidence and may
dent the speed of the recovery. The modest recovery of Portugal is set to
continue as financing conditions and external demand gradually improve.
…and domestic
demand is expected
to expand …

GDP growth in the EU and the euro area is expected to be led primarily by
domestic demand which should benefit this year and next from lower oil
prices and more supportive monetary and fiscal policies. The implementation
of structural reforms and reforms of the financial architecture (e.g. banking
union) should also support the conditions for a pick-up in domestic demand.
In 2016, domestic demand should also start to feel some support from the EU
Investment Plan.
Lower energy prices are expected to be a key factor driving the expansion of
private consumption. With slightly improved employment prospects and
nominal compensation of employees rising, nominal disposable income is
expected to increase further, while the very low consumer price inflation will
boost real income this year. Households are however expected to slightly
increase their savings this year, reflecting some willingness to restore levels
eroded during the crisis, ongoing deleveraging and uncertainty.
While investment has been held back in most EU Member States by
deleveraging pressures in the corporate sector, fiscal constraints as well as
heightened economic and policy uncertainty, it should gradually benefit from
strengthening demand prospects, the diminishing need for balance sheet
adjustment, as well as improved credit conditions and profit margins.
Equipment investment is expected to pick up more strongly as of the second
half of 2015, whereas the recovery in construction investment will only
become significant in 2016 when the negative impact of the on-going
adjustment in housing markets is less felt.

…but net exports will
contribute little to
growth.

The depreciation of the euro's nominal effective exchange rate should
strengthen the competitiveness of EU and euro area exporters. This impact,
however, is forecast to remain moderate since only about half of the change
in exchange rates is usually passed on to export prices. EU exports should
also benefit from the expected acceleration in global trade. But, net exports
are expected to contribute little to GDP growth over the forecast horizon, as
domestic demand growth should lead to an offsetting rise in imports.

Financial conditions
have further
improved …

Financial market conditions in the EU continued to improve since the
autumn. The ECB's Comprehensive Assessment results came in line with
expectations, contributing to an overall positive impact on confidence in the
banking sector. Benchmark sovereign bond yields have fallen further while
euro area Member States' sovereign bond spreads have seen a further
narrowing. Although economic and geopolitical worries have led to increased
volatility in financial markets over the last few months, the overall trend in
European equity markets has remained positive. The sizeable purchases of
public and private securities to be conducted by the ECB should help further

Overview

ease broad financial conditions in the euro area, thereby reducing financial
fragmentation further and supporting the economic activity.
Bank lending to the private sector remains weak in the euro area, but it is
gradually improving. Although a high level of non-performing loans in
vulnerable Member States is contributing to maintain banks' balance sheets
under pressure, banks nevertheless appear in a better position to support
lending in the near future. The continued easing of credit standards and the
increase in loan demand suggest that credit growth for non-financial
corporations (NFCs) may eventually turn positive in 2015 when the recovery
strengthens. Moreover, the ECB's quantitative easing should contribute to the
recovery in bank lending, particularly in those economies where credit supply
constraints are still binding.
…and the
aggregated fiscal
stance remains
neutral…

The significant fiscal efforts undertaken since 2010 in the EU and the euro
area are bearing fruits since the deficit–to-GDP ratio in both areas is expected
to have decreased to 3.0% and 2.6% respectively in 2014. Helped by
strengthening economic activity, cost-containment in public wages and lower
interest expenditure, government deficits are forecast to continue falling over
this year and next to reach 2.2% of GDP in the EU and 1.9% in the euro area
in 2016. In 2014 and 2015, after years of strong fiscal tightening, the
aggregated fiscal policy stance is expected to be neutral. The debt-to-GDP
ratio is expected to peak at 88.4% in the EU in 2014 and at 94.4% in the euro
area in 2015, before declining as inflation and the recovery pick up.

…while labour market
improvements seem
to have become
more entrenched…

Employment growth in the EU should remain only moderately positive in the
near term, as the strength of economic growth is expected to be insufficient
for a marked improvement. Yet, the expected strengthening of the economic
recovery should trigger stronger job creation in the second half of 2015 and
even more so in 2016. Moreover, major reforms in the labour market, such as
decentralised wage bargaining and more flexible wage arrangements, notably
in some vulnerable Member States, reforms to reduce the tax wedge in a
number of countries as well as past wage moderation will also support job
creation. Employment in 2016 is forecast to rise by 0.9% in the EU and 1.0%
in the euro area. The unemployment rate in the EU and the euro area is
expected to decline further to 9.3% and 10.6% respectively in 2016. This is
still well above pre-crisis levels and reflects not only cyclical factors but also
the persistence of high structural unemployment.

…and inflation is
temporally dipping
below zero.

Disinflation accelerated at the end of last year as the steep fall in energy
prices dominated headline inflation and prices for other commodities also
declined. The pass-through of commodity prices will continue to dampen the
inflation outlook in 2015, only partly compensated for by the gradual
narrowing of the output gap and the depreciation of the euro. Annual HICP
inflation is expected to be negative for the first half of this year in the euro
area, and for the first quarter in the EU. Next year, the impact of lower
energy prices is expected to fade and eventually reverse when energy prices
gradually turn around. At the same time, stronger domestic demand, the
impact of the recently decided ECB measures and the pass-through of the
lower euro exchange rate should push inflation noticeably higher.

Projections subject to
large uncertainty.

Overall, the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook has increased.
Downside risks have intensified, while new upside risks have emerged linked
to the impact of the oil price fall, the ECB's quantitative easing and the EU
investment plan, all of which are difficult to fully apprehend at this stage.

5

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

Geo-political risks are still high, as tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine
conflict could increase, and the economic impact of sanctions and
countersanctions could prove larger than expected in particular if they last
longer than assumed. An intensification of conflicts in the MENA region
could also hurt EU growth. Renewed bouts of financial market volatility
remain a possibility, as the expected normalisation of monetary policy in the
US could increase investors' risk aversion.
In the EU, despite the factors that lift economic activity in the near term,
sluggish growth may still turn into a long period of very low growth or
stagnation if the rise in structural unemployment is permanent and the trend
of falling productivity growth is not reversed leading to a further fall in
potential growth. In this context, lack of swift implementation of reforms in
the EU could be damaging for the growth outlook.
A protracted period of very low or negative inflation would increase the risk
of a further decline in inflation expectations and of higher real financing
costs, which would hamper investment and deleveraging efforts. It would
also increase the risk of negative second-round effects on income and raise
the risk of outright deflation, in the sense of a broad-based and selfperpetuating fall in prices, with negative consequences for growth and
employment.
This forecast assumes that a determined policy response, at the EU and
Member States level, will avoid the materialisation of such risks. On the
upside, the full impact of recent measures may not yet be reflected in these
projections. The ECB's unconventional monetary policy measures could
reverse medium-term inflation expectations faster than expected so that an
earlier adjustment in the path of inflation is achieved. The divergence in
monetary policy cycles between the US and the euro area could also be
reflected in further weakening of the euro's effective exchange rate, which
would strengthen the euro area exports performance. Moreover, the EU
Investment Plan could induce a faster-than-expected revival of investment.
Successful structural reforms could lead to a quicker-than-expected recovery
in labour markets which would in turn support domestic demand. Upside
risks to the growth outlook also include a stronger-than expected boost to
global and EU growth stemming from low oil prices. Should the recovery be
faster than expected and the depreciation of the euro's effective exchange rate
stronger than assumed, inflation in the EU could also turn out higher than
forecast.

PART I
EA and EU outlook

THE RECOVERY JOURNEY CONTINUES
The EU economy is entering its third year of recovery, but economic growth remains stuck in low gear
and output has yet to reach pre-crisis levels. Momentum is weak partly because recoveries from deep
economic and financial crises normally are, but also because of factors specific to the EU, some of
which were already evident before the crisis, including structural weaknesses that have not yet been
fully addressed by structural reforms. Work on them is progressing but remains far from finished.
The sharp fall in oil price should provide a lift to economic growth in the EU. It works like a tax cut on
EU consumers and companies but without raising deficits or debt, and it also supports global growth. In
2015, lower oil prices are expected to support domestic demand, while the euro’s depreciation supports
exports. However, with interest rates close to zero, lower inflation increases real interest rates and this
is expected to lower the positive oil-price effects. In 2016, additional support should come from the
further diminishing crisis legacy, further improving labour market conditions, and fruits of the already
implemented structural reforms. With the help of important policy measures such as quantitative easing
in the euro area and the EU Investment Plan, GDP is forecast to grow this year by 1.3 % in the euro
area and 1.7 % in the EU (both 0.2 pp. higher than forecast last autumn), before picking up further to
1.9 % and 2.1 % in 2016 (up 0.2 pp. and 0.1 pp. respectively) (Graph I.1).
The flipside of falling oil prices, however, is a disinflationary effect, which should pull headline inflation
lower during most of 2015. Core inflation should be less affected given the gradually diminishing slack
in the labour market and the euro’s depreciation, which will push up prices of imported goods and
services. The lower price of oil is expected to have a considerable effect on inflation in 2015, when
HICP inflation is expected to fall to -0.1% (-0.9 pp.) in the euro area and 0.2% (-0.8 pp.) in the EU,
before rebounding to 1.3% (-0.2 pp.) and 1.4% (-0.1 pp.) in 2016, supported by base effects and an
assumed gradual rebound in oil prices (Graph I.2).
The slightly more positive outlook for economic activity is good news for job creation, which should
continue and help to lower unemployment in the euro area and the EU in 2015 and 2016. However, the
momentum of employment growth is expected to remain too low for a substantial improvement in the
labour market situation.
The uncertainty surrounding these projections is substantial. Downside risks to the growth outlook from
economic, political and financial developments have intensified since the autumn, but some new upside
risks have also emerged recently. Also new upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook have
appeared since autumn.

PUTTING THE WINTER FORECAST INTO
PERSPECTIVE: LOWER OIL PRICES AND THE
EU ECONOMY

The sharp decline in oil price since mid-2014 is an
important ingredient in the winter forecast. The
decline is substantial in comparison to oil market
developments in recent years. A closer look at the
driving forces points to a dominant role of supply
factors, which were enhanced by demand factors
and financial market developments. Accordingly,
market expectations are for an only gradual
rebound in price. As empirical studies suggest, the
propagation of the positive oil-price shock is
expected to happen mainly via higher household
real disposable incomes and wider company profit
margins of companies. These effects also tend to
raise the capacity of households and firms to serve
debt and continue deleveraging.

Crude oil prices have declined substantially in
recent months…

From peak of USD 115 per barrel in June 2014,
the Brent oil price had fallen to below 50 USD in
January 2015. This decline followed a period of
relative stability since 2012 (see Graph I.3). Due to
the appreciation of the US dollar, the oil price
decline has been less pronounced in euro terms.
Compared to previous episodes, the recent decline
in oil prices has been substantial. Since the mid1980s there had been five periods during which oil
prices declined by at least 30% within six months
(see Graph I.4). All these periods were
characterised by economic downturns or crises,
e.g. the Asian crisis in 1997-98, the recessions in
the US economy in 1990-91 and 2001, and the
global economic and financial crisis in 2007-09.
Another sharp decline in 1985-86 mainly reflected
a change in the policy by OPEC, which wanted to
regain market share from non-OPEC producers
such as the UK and Norway which had expanded
capacity and gained market share after a period of
steadily rising prices.

The sharp fall in energy prices is expected to lower
headline inflation massively. At the current
juncture, with nominal interest rates close to zero
and already very low inflation, the impact on
inflation tends to raise real interest rates via
inflation expectations, which then weigh on
interest-rate sensitive components of GDP and
slightly lower the positive impact on growth. But
in the euro area quantitative easing should put a lid
on the impact on real interest rates. The negative
impact of oil-price driven lower inflation on
nominal income growth may partly offset the
positive impact of higher disposable incomes on
debt sustainability for households and firms.

…driven by both supply and demand factors.

Pressure on oil prices has come from
developments in actual and expected supply and
demand, but also financial variables. Since many
factors had been in place for some time, such as
the increase in supply from unconventional
sources, the question about the triggers of the
recent decline arises. The search for the answers is
complicated by the different and time-varying lags
with which factors affect the oil price. (1) For
(1)

%

In the empirical literature Kilian pioneered a way to
decompose oil price movements into three components
driven by shocks to oil supply, global activity, and oil

EA and EU outlook

example, a higher drilling level is usually expected
to raise oil production with a lag of about two
quarters. But, as for any storable commodity, the
impact of factors also depends on stocks and
storage facilities, which can advance and postpone
price movements. This makes it difficult to assess
price elasticities.

…whereas oil demand growth has recently
weakened...

Oil supplies have been steadily rising…

Global crude oil output has expanded markedly in
recent years (see Graph I.5), supported by
structural changes in oil production. The most
prominent example of an extension of oil
production in response to a period of relatively
high oil prices is the expansion of production in
North America, where technologies of extracting
oil from tight rock formations and tar sands by
hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’) and horizontal
drilling had become profitable. The new
technology allowed a faster set-up of drilling
equipment than conventional methods and
reached. (2)
Graph I.5: Global oil supply

Saudi Arabia’s intention to maintain its market
share contrasts with the past as the country has
traditionally acted as the cartel’s swing producer,
using its spare capacity to either increase or
decrease oil supply in order to stabilise prices
within a margin set by OPEC.

Global demand for oil has grown only moderately
in recent years for structural reasons that are
augmented by short-term factors such as cyclical
conditions, weather-related developments and
policy decisions. The structural factors include a
long-term reduction in the energy and oil intensity
of production (see Graph I.6). This is apparent in
oil demand in the US where the recovery
strengthened in 2014, but oil demand remained
well below its pre-crisis level in 2007. This reflects
advances in technology, conservation efforts and
energy and fuel efficiency. Policies that favour less
carbon-intensive energy can also be expected to
have lowered the share of oil in energy
consumption. As regards cyclical conditions, the
slowdown in global economic activity in early
2014 lowered oil demand below expected levels.
In particular, the temporary weakness in some
advanced economies and slow growth in the EU
economy exerted downward pressure on oil
demand.

Global oil supply has also been affected by
country-specific factors, such the legacy of war
(e.g. Iraq), the Arab Spring (e.g. in Libya), civil
wars (e.g. in Syria), sanctions against oil-exporting
countries (e.g. in Iran), but also strikes (e.g. in
Libya from March to July 2014). On November
27, another positive effect on supply emerged from
OPEC’s decision to maintain its target production
without responding to declining prices. Especially

...and financial factors may have accentuated
the sharp decline…

Explanations that rely on the imbalance of oil
demand and supply only implicitly take account of
the role of oil inventories. They depend on
expectations concerning the future balance of
supply and demand, but also financial factors that

11

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

are crucial for the profitability of storage and the
assessment of futures. (3) For instance, the expected
increase in US interest rates has raised the
opportunity costs of holding stocks of oil and
contributed to the nominal appreciation of the US
dollar, most notably since mid-2014. As empirical
evidence suggests, an appreciating US dollar is
associated with lower oil prices, (4) which could
suggest that increasing monetary divergence acted
as a trigger for the steep slide in prices in the
second half of 2014. (5)
…that has overall been dominated by supply
factors.

In real time it is difficult to disentangle demand
and supply factors behind changes in crude oil
prices. In the first half of last year, prices of some
cyclical commodities (e.g. minerals and metals),
mostly originating from less troubled regions, fell
reflecting weaker demand. But oil prices remained
relatively stable, which could support the view that
(upside) supply concerns related to rising
geopolitical tensions in oil-exporting regions were
stronger than (downside) demand factors. The
observation that the oil price decline in the second
half of last year was not mimicked across
commodity markets again supports the argument
that (then downside) supply factors were
dominant. Moreover, the relatively small size of
revisions to global growth forecasts suggests that
demand weakness is unlikely to have been a key
driver of the decline.
A quantification of the relative impact of demand
and supply factors on oil prices depends on
estimates of the price elasticity. But the price
elasticity of oil demand varies by crude brand,
geographical region, time and statistical technique,
whereas the price elasticity of supply also depends
on confounding effects of resource depletion and
technical innovations. (6) In a supply-led oil price

In his overview on this subject Smith describes estimates
between -0.05 (short-run) and -0.30 (long-run) as typical
for the demand elasticity, and refers to estimates of
between 0.02 (short-run) and 0.35 (long-run) for the supply

decline the market rebalancing can be expected to
work primarily by supply adjusting downward
toward demand. According to oil market analyses,
the current price level is below production costs
across North America and is unsustainable at these
levels. Moreover, oil-targeted drilling activity in
Canada and the US is already reported to have
dropped, which could support this adjustment.
Therefore a supply-side adjustment can be
expected, which should take time given a rather
inelastic oil supply in the short run.

The outlook for the oil market is for a slow price
rebound…

The expected future oil price path is a key factor
for household and company decisions. Indications
about future oil prices can be derived from earlier
experiences, survey-based information and from
futures markets. (7) Historically, periods of
substantially falling oil prices have tended to last
long, which could suggest that prices would
gradually rebound but remain rather low over the
forecast horizon (see Graph I.7). However, each oil
price decline has had its own specific
circumstances, which limits the comparability. The
most recent survey indicators, the January 2015
Consensus Economics forecast means, point to a
moderate rebound in the coming months.

slightly smaller in euro terms (37% in 2015, 28%
in 2016).

The oil price decline should have significant
effects on global economic activity and inflation
with the transmission and impact varying across
and within regions. In the global economy, oil
price declines create winners and losers by
inducing a substantial redistribution of income
from those who sell oil to those who purchase it.

A market-based indication of future spot prices is
provided by futures contracts, which are usually
seen as unbiased predictors of future spot prices. In
early 2015, the settlement prices of futures
contracts form an upward sloping curve for
successive expiration dates (see Graph I.9), i.e. a
rebound is priced in.

These market expectations enter the assumptions
of the winter forecast, which are based on futures
markets (for details see Box I.4). Following an
average oil price of 99.7 USD/bbl in 2014, a
decline to an average of 53.0 in 2015 and a
rebound to 61.5 in 2016 is assumed. This implies a
substantial downward revision by 42% (2015) and
by 34% (2016) with respect to the autumn forecast.
However, due to the recent depreciation of the
euro exchange rate, the downward revisions are

In oil exporting countries the lower oil price means
a substantial decline in oil revenues. The impact on
private and public spending decisions often
depends largely on the funds accumulated during
period of relatively high oil prices that could now
be used to smooth spending. Overall, oil exporters
can be expected to lower their imports from
oil-importing countries (‘oil-bill recycling
channel’) (8). At the current juncture, this effect is
compounded by the widespread appreciation of the
US dollar and the role of dollar-denominated debt
and wealth.
...and is expected to push global economic
growth.

The large redistribution (transfer) from oil
producers to oil consumers is expected to boost
global growth because oil-importing countries are
expected to spend more of the additionally
available funds than oil-producing countries are
expected to cut spending. Thus, the impact on
global GDP is expected to be positive. (9) An
indication of the redistributive effect in the EU can
be derived from its oil trade balance. According to
Commission statistics, the EU imported about
EUR 388.6 bn of crude oil from non-EU countries
in 2013 (almost 3% of nominal GDP) paying an
average price of 108.8 USD/bbl., which is more
than twice of what is assumed for 2015.

producer and consumer prices...

necessary to look at the main transmission

channels through which lower oil prices are passed
through and the specific situation in the year 2015
is helpful. The pass-through depends on the tax
and tariff system and the type of energy products
that households and companies are consuming,
which contributes to the explanation of differences
between countries. Evidence from the fall in oil
prices in 2008 suggests that about half of the
decline in the crude oil price shows up in fuel
prices (see Graph I.10). The comparison with the
current price decline also suggests that in
December 2014 a smaller part of the oil price
decline had been passed through than in the
corresponding time period in 2008-09.

and

The most important impact on consumers stems
from a lower energy bill (discretionary income
effect). Since less needs to be spent on gas and
heating, other goods can be purchased, as the real
disposable income of households increases. How
the additional income is used depends on the
marginal propensity of consumption and the
persistence of low oil prices, which is crucial for
decisions about the purchases of energy-intensives
durables such as larger cars. Quick and rapid
changes in oil prices may raise uncertainty about
oil prices, inducing households to postpone some
spending decisions (uncertainty effect). (10) Since
consumers may expect the economy to benefit
from lower oil prices, optimism about the future
economic situation could increase and sentiment
improve, which could lower the amount of
precautionary savings (precautionary (dis)savings

For an overview see S. Jo, The effects of oil price

Money, Credit and Banking, September 2014, Vol. 46, No.

effect), which partly offsets the increase of savings
that results from consumption smoothening
following the increase in incomes. The recent
substantial increase in the Commission’s
Consumer Confidence Indicator (in DecemberJanuary up by 2.3 pts. in the EU and by 3.0 pts. in
the euro area) supports this expectation.
The most important direct effect on companies is
related to lower energy costs, which reduce the
marginal costs of production (cost channel). As
lower prices gradually filter through the production
and supply chain, most businesses should see
lower input costs. Even companies that do not use
fuel directly in their production processes, benefit
from lower transportation costs. An indirect effect
relates to higher demand for a company’s product,
either from households or from other companies
(demand channel). However, like households,
abrupt changes in oil prices tend to create
uncertainty about the future path of oil prices,
which could delay investment decisions and exert
a negative impact on the business activity
(uncertainty effect). Following the initial impact
on oil-related goods and services prices, cheaper
oil means that demand for other (substitutable)
energy sources like coal and gas is likely to fall,
putting pressure on their prices.
Whether wage developments follow inflation is of
crucial importance for the assessment of secondround effects. In both the euro area and the EU the
most recent increases in wage costs (1.4% in
2014-Q3) clearly exceeded consumer price
inflation.
...improves the terms of trade and tends to
widen the current account surplus...

Lower oil prices tend to lower the index of import
prices and thereby improve the terms of trade. The
lower oil import bill affects directly the trade
balance, as for instance observed in response to the
oil price decline in 2009 (see Graph I.11). A lower
price elasticity of oil imports, as observed in recent
years in advanced economies, implies a larger
impact in the oil part of the trade balance. But the
overall impact on the external balance is more
difficult to uncover because the oil price shock
also affects the non-oil part of the balance. (11) The
positive impact on consumption and investment
can be expected to expand non-oil imports.

...and affects financial markets.

The ‘financialisation’ of oil implies that oil has
some of the attributes of a collateral asset that
backs up dollar liabilities, which decline in value
when the price of oil declines. Thereby, lower oil
prices create concerns for investors regarding their
energy-related investments.
Negative returns for energy stocks are weighing on
some financial markets, but the overall impact on
stock indices should be positive as profit
expectations of many companies such as airlines or
others with significant fuel costs improve. Bonds
issues by oil and gas producers have already fallen

The overall impact of oil price changes has mostly
been looked at for oil price increases (Table I.1).
Empirical studies have found for supply-driven oil
price shocks a substantial negative impact on GDP
growth and a positive impact on inflation. Results
for demand-driven oil price declines are more
difficult to interpret since weaker global demand
not only lowers the oil price, but also pulls down
foreign demand, which more than offsets the
expansionary impact of increased domestic real
incomes and higher profit margins. (12)
Structural changes (e.g. the declining share of oil
in GDP and in energy consumption, the
diminishing role of manufacturing in some EU
Member States) have lowered the importance of
oil. Therefore studies focussing on oil price shocks
in the 1980s and 1990s may not sufficiently reflect
current circumstances. The repercussions for real
GDP may have declined as compared to earlier
rapid oil price changes. (13) Changes in monetary

policy and more flexible labour markets may have
reduced the impact of shocks. Expectations
concerning the expected duration of the negative
oil price shock may differ from past episodes, for
instance reflecting shorter adjustment periods for
oil supply as a result of technological advances.
These arguments could suggest expecting a more
moderate effect from the current price decline than
results than those described in some empirical
studies.
...but the impact of oil price increases and
decreases is asymmetric.

Since the uncertainty effect, associated with
substantial changes in oil prices, is on the negative
side for both price increases and decreases, it is
rather obvious that the overall impact of price
increases and decreases can hardly be
symmetric. (14) Therefore, in interpreting the results
of studies of oil price hikes, caution is needed due
to the asymmetry between the impact of higher and
lower prices, which limits the validity of results
obtained for price increases. (15)
Close to the zero lower bound the impact of an
oil price shock on output is cushioned…

Currently, specific circumstances in the EU and
the euro area, such as nominal interest rates close
to zero and very low inflation prevailing already
before the oil price decline, need to be taken into
account. (16) This implies that central banks have

For instance, in a study of G7 countries Serletis finds for
European countries symmetry for France and the UK, but

little room to lower (nominal) interest rates should
they not look through the impact of oil prices on
headline inflation and consider a response to the
disinflationary impact of falling oil prices.
Empirical studies emphasise episodes where
monetary policy responses to oil price shocks have
augmented the impact on economic activity. (17)
With nominal interest rates at the zero bound,
disinflation hits short-term real interest rates
without being cushioned. This could weigh on
interest-rate sensitive components of GDP such as
investment and so partly offset the expansionary
effect of lower oil prices on economic activity.
Higher medium- to long-term real interest rates
could also reduce the number of profitable
investment projects and therefore depress gross
fixed capital formation. The size of these offsetting
effects depends on the factors that drive inflation
expectations. They include expectations about the
expected duration of low oil prices, which in turn
depend on the sources of the shock, the indirect
effects of energy prices on other prices, and
second-round effects.
Recent analyses have shown that the zero lower
bound constraint on interest rates tends to cushion
the impact of an oil price shock on GDP as
compared to situations where nominal interest
rates were not close to the zero bound. (18) The
strength of the cushioning is related to the source
of the oil price shock and the resulting profile of
the price response. If the oil price decline occurs
gradually enough to induce a persistent decline in
inflation, GDP could even contract temporarily.
However, the zero lower bound has been found to
play a much smaller role in the case of oil supply

presented by J.D. Hamilton, What is an oil shock?, Journal
of Econometrics, April 2003, Vol. 113, No. 2, pp. 363–398.
Accordingly the systematic response of monetary policy to
oil shocks has attracted a lot of attention in empirical
analyses. For instance, Bernanke et al. argued that a large
part of the effect of increases in oil prices in the 1970s can
be attributed to tighter monetary policy in response to these
shocks. See B.S. Bernanke, M. Gertler and M. Watson,
Systematic monetary policy and the effects of oil price
shocks, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1997, No.
1, pp. 91–142.

analyse an oil price increase with nominal rates at the zero
bound within a two-country DSGE model. See M.

zero bound on nominal interest rates, Journal of
International Money and Finance, February 2013, Vol. 32,

shocks emanating from abroad. Such shocks,
which include the one currently unfolding lead
only to a one-time decline in the oil price with no
protracted effect on inflation. In such cases, the
impact on the real interest rate should be rather
limited and the impact of the shock similar to those
that take place under more normal conditions.

Overall, these considerations suggest that the
impact from lower oil prices on output that can be
expected this time round is likely to be more
moderate than it would be if inflation and nominal
interest rates were at higher, more normal levels.
But the projected rebound in inflation rates in the
euro area and in the EU towards the end of the
forecast horizon implies that the impact on real
interest rates will mainly be observable in the short
term. (19) Inflation expectations have markedly
fallen since mid-2014 not only in the euro area but
also in the US (see Graph I.12). Should they not
rebound as projected in the euro area, for instance
due to the impact of lagged inflation rates,(20)
negative effects from higher real interest rate
effects could shave off a larger part of the
expansionary impact of the oil price decline.
An increase in real interest rates resulting from
lower inflation also affects existing nominal debt.
(19)

(20)

According to the ECB’s Survey of Professional
Forecasters for the first quarter of 2015, average inflation
expectations stood at 0.3%, 1.1% and 1.5% for 2015, 2016
and 2017 respectively.
Empirical studies have found that in a low-inflation
environment, some dis-anchoring can occur as expectations
are more dependent on lagged inflation; see e.g.
M. Ehrmann, Targeting inflation from below – How do
inflation expectations behave?, Bank of Canada Working
Papers no 2014-52, December 2014.

Negative inflation rates make servicing existing
debt more difficult for leveraged companies and
financial institutions (Irving Fisher’s debt-deflation
argument), (21) because they cannot rewrite debt
contracts to lower the impact of falling prices on
their balance sheets. This could increase banks’
efforts to raise reserves-to-deposit ratios and result
in higher risk premia on corporate debt with
increased financial fragmentation. However, at the
current juncture the temporary fall in inflation is
caused by a foreign oil supply shock that lowers
input prices and boost real disposable incomes,
which facilitates deleveraging and thereby
mitigates negative effects of higher real interest
rates on debt sustainability. Moreover, at the
current juncture, the euro’s depreciation should
mitigate the negative impact of lower oil prices on
inflation. Since the euro depreciation is especially
pronounced vis-à-vis the US dollar and crude oil is
usually priced in US dollars independent of its
origin, the mitigating effect should be relatively
strong. This makes it unlikely to see the
aforementioned process really becoming a matter
of concern.
…but the overall the effect is positive for
economic activity in the EU economy.

Overall, low oil prices are good news for the EU
economy. In the short term, the economic effect of
falling oil prices will be equivalent to a substantial
union-wide tax cut without budgetary implications.
It should boost demand and lower headline
inflation. Given the current environment, however,
the impact on economic activity will likely be
muffled by the fact that inflation is so low,
nominal interest rates are close to zero, and the
fact that households and companies are still
deleveraging in many Member States. The
depreciation of the euro and all measures that
could intensify it, such as quantitative easing in the
euro area, are also partly offsetting the impact of
the decline because oil is prices in dollars.
However, at the same time, the positive impact of
quantitative easing on inflation expectations in the
euro area limits the impact of lower inflation on
real interest rates and supports through this
channel the positive impact of lower oil prices on
economic activity.

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

The outlook for global GDP growth and world
trade remains rather uneven. Global growth and
world trade are expected to accelerate moderately
in 2015 and 2016, pushed by a gradual recovery in
advanced economies (particularly the US) and
some improvement from recent weakness in
emerging markets. The sharp drop in global oil
prices will help underpin global growth, but the
overall impact has been partly masked by countryspecific factors which seem to push in the opposite
direction. Changes relative to the autumn forecast
are therefore limited in aggregate terms, but there
are substantial adjustments for individual
countries. These reflect a combination of countryspecific factors with the differentiated impact of
commodity price movements and the divergent
prospects for some large commodity importers and
commodity exporters.
Economic growth picked up after the loss of
momentum at the start of 2014…

The global economy lost momentum in the first
quarter of 2014, due mainly to temporary signs of
weakness in some advanced economies,
particularly the weather-related slowdown in the
US economy. However, global growth picked up
in the second quarter (to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter
from 0.4%) and in the third quarter (0.7%) with a
rebound in the contribution to growth of the
advanced economies, despite lower-than-expected
outcomes in Japan in both the second and the third
quarter.

Growth in emerging economies as a whole also
edged up slightly during the first three quarters of
2014, but this masked a continued divergence in
performance. While the situation for Russia,

18

MENA countries and some Latin American
economies worsened following further commodity
price declines, the global impact was offset by
improvements in the economic situation of India,
Indonesia and Turkey. Developments in China
have also been mixed, with weakness in the
domestic economy countered by a recovery in
export growth.
…and lower oil prices should support a further
increase in global growth in 2015-16...

Leading indicators continue to point to firm global
growth going forward. While business confidence
indicators (global PMIs) fell slightly over the
course of the second half of last year from their
summer highs, they remain clearly in expansionary
territory, which bodes well for the short-term
outlook. Global growth (including the EU) is
expected to be 3.3% in 2014 and to accelerate to
3.6% in 2015 and to 4.0% in 2016 (see Table I.2).
Among the advanced economies, the US economy
has rebounded particularly well. Following a
contraction of economic activity in the first quarter
(-0.5% quarter on quarter), the second and third
quarters recorded GDP growth of 1.1% and 1.0%
(q-o-q), driven mainly by consumption but
supported by a strengthening labour market. The
outlook for the US economy should get a boost
from lower oil prices, particularly in 2015, as the
effect in 2016 will be somewhat dampened by the
gradual turnaround in oil prices and the
moderating effect of a stronger US dollar.
The outlook for Japan in 2015 and 2016 has also
improved since the autumn forecast. Japan is
expected to benefit from lower oil prices, as well
as from some rebound in activity following a
weaker-than-forecast performance in 2014,
together with the effects of renewed monetary
easing. The upward revision also takes into
account the postponement of the consumption tax
increase originally scheduled for October 2015.
Growth in emerging markets is expected to
accelerate modestly to 5.0% in 2015 (from 4.4% in
2014 and 4.6% in 2013) and 5.3% in 2016. As
with the advanced economies, the aggregate hides
considerable divergence among countries. On the
one hand, the economic prospects for oil-exporting
countries have worsened (particularly in Latin
America, Russia and the Middle East and North
Africa). On the other hand the economic outlook
has improved in parts of emerging Asia, such as

by

accelerating

world

trade

Momentum in world trade improved visibly from
June, with trade volumes rebounding both in
advanced economies and emerging markets after
some weakness in early 2014, according to data
released by the Centraal Planbureau’s (CPB)
World Trade Monitor. While trade flows remained
strong in the beginning of the fourth quarter, the
forecast for trade has been revised down slightly
for 2014 and 2015 and left unchanged for 2016.
The downward revision reflects the statistical
effect of the weak start to the year, but also a
reassessment of the trade outlook in certain
economies and in the global trade elasticity given
that a combination of cyclical and structural
factors continue to act as drags on global trade
flows (see Box I.1).
Trade forecasts have been revised down
particularly for emerging markets, especially
Russia, where the deepening recession and the

depreciating currency are weighing on imports,
and China, where the ongoing property market
correction and slower growth in investment have
led to more sluggish domestic demand, and a more
subdued trade outlook. World imports are now
expected to have grown 2.6% in 2014 and to
strengthen gradually to 4.3% in 2015 and 5.3% in
2016.
Falling commodity prices create disinflationary
pressure…

As regards commodity prices, the key
development over the last months has been the
decline in crude oil prices, which has caused
substantial revisions in the oil price assumptions
that are underlying this forecast (see Section I.1).
Revisions to assumptions for other commodity
prices have been comparatively small.
Prices of minerals and metals are projected to have
fallen on average by about 11% in 2014, owing to
soft industrial performance in China, the world’s
largest metals market, and ample stockpiles of
most metals. A modest recovery in some metal
prices is expected this year and next, supported by
improving supply-side rationalisation outside
China and increasing demand in advanced and
emerging countries.
Prices of food commodities have declined in 2014
and should continue to fall in 2015 before
rebounding slightly in 2016. With the exception of

19

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

beverages, beef and some edible oils, the prices of
most agricultural commodities were on a
downward trend in 2014. Owing to a comfortable
production outlook, food prices, particularly for
soya beans and main cereals, are projected to
decline further in 2015. For agricultural non-food
commodities, large stockpiles of cotton and rubber
are likely to keep their prices down in 2014-16.
…and contribute to global risk factors.

There will be positive effects from lower oil prices
for the global outlook, and they are likely to
continue over the forecast horizon. The regional
impacts and spillovers will be differentiated, with
associated upside and downside risks. More
generally, the oil price constitutes both upside and
downside risks to the global growth outlook.
Geopolitical tensions in various regions remain
associated with risks to the global outlook and may
turn out to be more protracted than previously
assumed. These two factors, oil and geopolitical
tensions, may interact as in recent turbulences
affecting Russian financial markets. Risks of a
further deterioration in Russia and the region also
remain elevated.
Doubts over the robustness of the US outlook have
clearly diminished, but this raises the likelihood of
divergent trends in monetary policy and greater
financial market volatility, especially if relatively
weak growth persists in the EU and Japan while
monetary policy in the US is gradually normalised.
The credit overhang in China continues to raise
concerns about financial stability and the
sustainability of the current growth pattern. More
generally, there are vulnerabilities among many
emerging markets as growth becomes more reliant
on progress with structural reforms and there are
rising risks of capital flow reversals as global
interest rates rise.

3.

FINANCIAL MARKETS

In recent months, financial markets have mainly
been driven by increasing divergences between the
monetary policies of the major economies.
In the US, at its December meeting, the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintained its
view that inflation will gradually rise towards the
two-percent target as the labour market improves
and the effects of lower energy prices dissipate.
Although the Federal Reserve altered its forward

20

guidance, announcing to be 'patient' in its plan to
start normalising interest rates, it remained on
track for tightening monetary policy in mid-2015.
Meanwhile in the UK, the Bank of England’s
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been
divided on rate decisions since August last year.
With inflation falling substantially, market
expectations about the timing of the first interest
hike have been revised. By contrast, the ECB has
continued its unconventional monetary policies
and announced substantial quantitative easing in
January 2015. These decisions taken by the central
banks in the largest constituencies have
immediately affected other central banks. This
includes the Swiss National Bank’s decision of
discontinuing the minimum exchange rate peg visà-vis the euro, and also cuts in policy interest rates
in several EU Member States outside the euro area
(e.g. in Denmark and Romania) and market
expectations of such cuts (e.g. in Sweden and
Poland).
Apart from the impact on foreign exchange rates,
increasing monetary policy divergence have
caused higher volatility in financial markets. In
stock markets, expectations that monetary policies
will
continue
or
become
even
more
accommodative have pushed leading indices to
new historical highs, whereas long-term interest
rates continued their downward movement,
bringing the sovereign bond spreads for most EU
Member States down with them. All these
developments triggered responses with wider
macroeconomic relevance and are therefore crucial
ingredients in the winter forecast.
The ECB launched an
purchase programme…

expanded

asset

Against a backdrop of weak economic conditions
and the outlook for low inflation rates, the ECB
Governing Council decided at its first monetary
policy meeting of 2015 to launch an Expanded
Asset Purchase Programme for euro-denominated
investment-grade securities issued by euro area
governments and agencies and EU institutions.
The combined monthly asset purchases of public
and private securities will amount to EUR 60
billion. This quantitative easing is intended to be
carried out from March 2015 until the end of
September 2016 and will continue until the
Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in
the path of inflation that is consistent with its aim
of achieving an inflation rate that is close to, but
below 2% over the medium term. The ECB

EA and EU outlook

Governing Council also decided to remove the 10
bps. spread over the main refinancing interest rate
(MRO) for the six remaining Targeted LongerTerm
Refinancing
Operations
(TLTROs).
Accordingly, the interest rate applicable to future
TLTROs will be equal to the rate on the
Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations
prevailing at the time when each TLTRO is
conducted.
The sizeable purchases of public and private
securities to be conducted under the ECB’s
quantitative easing should further ease broad
financial conditions in the euro area and support
the firm anchoring of medium to long-term
inflation expectations. By contributing to lower
real interest rates, the latest ECB package of
monetary easing measures should facilitate the
deleveraging process throughout the euro area
while also supporting credit demand.
…and financial market conditions improved
further…

Sovereign bond yields in the euro area continued
to decline in anticipation of the ECB’s expansion
of its asset purchases programme and also due to
very low inflation outcomes (see Graph I.14). For
instance, the yield on 10-year German Bunds has
continued to decline over the past couple of
months, and stood at a historical low of below
0.40% at the end of January. Short-term sovereign
bond yields of a growing number of euro area
Member States dropped into negative territory,
affecting about 1.4 trillion euro of sovereign debt.
Meanwhile, sovereign bond spreads with respect to
the German bund, including those of vulnerable
euro area Member States, have narrowed further.
However, Greek bond prices dropped on renewed
policy uncertainty.

The euro depreciated by some 4% in nominal
effective terms since the beginning of November
2014, amid an increasingly diverging monetary
policy stance and growth dynamics among major
advanced economies. Over the same period, the
euro depreciated by almost 10% against the US
dollar and by about 4% against the British pound.
This partly reflected expectations of interest rate
hikes in the US and the UK in the short term and
further monetary stimulus in the euro area. The
euro also depreciated by some 15% against the
Swiss franc after the Swiss National Bank ended
its exchange rate cap against the euro on 15
January. Monetary accommodation in Japan
limited the euro’s depreciation against the yen,
while the economic and political situation in
Russia caused the euro to appreciate by more than
40% against the Russian rouble.
…but volatility in stock markets increased.

Concerns about the economic outlook and
geopolitical tensions have been key drivers of
financial market developments over the last few
months. They led to higher volatility, particularly
on equity markets and the most risky segments of
the bond market. After being subdued towards the
end of 2014, European equity markets have turned
positive in January, supported by the ECB
measures (see Graph I.15). The positive sentiment
further improved as the ECB’s announcement of
size and design of an expanded asset purchase
programme exceeded market expectations.

Structural impediments remain. In the EU,
corporate bond spreads continued to tighten over
the recent months in the highest investment grades,
but to a lesser extent in the higher-yield segments.
While corporate bond issuance has reached alltime highs, there are concerns that secondary

Furthermore, lower-rated banks’ access to funding

of

in

bank

Bank lending to the private sector continued to
contract during 2014, but the pace of contraction
has fallen and there are signs of a turnaround as net
lending flows to some segments have turned
positive. The annual growth rate of loans to
households increased further, moving into positive
territory. However loans to the non-financial
corporate (NFC) sector remained weak although
the rate increased steadily without leaving negative
territory. While net issuance of debt securities by
non-financial corporates, which have emerged for
many firms as a substitute for bank loans,
continues to hover at record levels, its annual
growth rate has somewhat declined (5.1% in
November from 8.0% in August). The transition
towards market financing seemed to slow down as
bank lending recovered. As the more modest rise
in debt securities issuance did not fully offset the
contraction in bank lending volumes, the total debt
funding by non-financial corporates continued to
be slightly negative (see Graph I.16).

corporate savings relative to investments,
suggesting unused internal funds in many cases.
This might be due to deleveraging pressures in the
corporate sector and uncertain economic prospects.
The January 2015 ECB Bank Lending Survey
signals further improvements in bank lending for
both firms and households with easing credit
standards and positive demand for all types of
loans (see Graph I.17). The factors that contributed
to the net easing of credit standards continued to
be banks’ improved cost of funds and easing
balance-sheet constraints. On the demand side,
financing needs related to fixed investment
contributed positively to the strong increase in net
loan demand, recording the first significantly
positive contribution since mid-2011.

Cross-country differences in lending volumes did
not decline in 2014. Those in lending rates did, but
discrepancies remain high by historical standards.
Overall, price and non-price lending conditions are
still dispersed across countries. The view that weak
credit growth to corporates is driven to a large
extent by low demand for loans in a number of
Member States is supported by overall high

22

Historical relationships between economic and
credit cycles also suggest that the bank credit cycle
for non-financial corporates may further improve
and finally turn positive over the course of 2015.
Securities issuance is expected to contribute
positively to the overall external funding of nonfinancial corporates, although the transition to
market funding may further ease as bank lending
improves. Finally, corporations currently resort
extensively to internal funds for their investments,
a trend that may continue. Self-funding ratios are
expected to decline, but to remain higher than
during past cycles, especially in countries where
corporate indebtedness is highest and most
distressed.
…supported by a healthier position of banks.

The ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment results
came in line with expectations and showed that the
banking system in the euro area was overall well
capitalised and resilient to external shocks. The
recent efforts by EU banks to increase their capital

EA and EU outlook

levels suggest less acute deleveraging pressures.
However, in the medium to long term euro-area
banks still need to enhance their capital base to
ensure full compliance with higher capital
requirements under the Capital Requirement
Regulation and Directive (CRR/CRD IV) which
will become binding in 2018. Moreover, profit
generation remains a challenge for many banks,
which may call for further balance-sheet
adjustments. While the low-yield environment on
marketable instruments is partly to blame for
banks’ low profitability, the high level of nonperforming loans in several Member States is also
contributing to it and keeping banks’ balance
sheets under pressure in these countries (see
Graph I.18). Finally, banks’ asset rebalancing
along with the ECB’s quantitative easing should
result in higher lending although this process may
not be the same in every country or generalised
across all types of loans.

GDP AND ITS COMPONENTS

The recovery journey continues…

The EU economy enters its third year of recovery
in 2015, but so far the recovery has remained
subdued, reflecting the post-crisis legacy and EUspecific factors. The latter include factors that
already hampered growth dynamics before the
outbreak of the crisis and those that are for
instance associated with the sovereign debt crisis
such as high levels of public and private debt. (22)
So far structural weaknesses have not been
overcome everywhere in the EU and even years
after the start of the economic and financial crisis,
the implementation of structural reforms remains
unfinished. Other growth impediments have
recently gained importance such as uncertainty
about future policies and energy prices.

Risks for the European banking sector remain high
via exposures to compressed risk premia on a
range of financial assets and because of their
reduced profitability. Banks are particularly at risk
in the event of a re-emergence of the sovereign
debt crisis in the euro area because of their still
high and home-biased exposure. At the same time,
banks may no longer benefit from the same
implicit guarantee provided by their sovereigns in
a context of increased preference for ‘bail-in’
among governments. Potential stress in financial
markets would therefore further undermine banks’
already weak profitability and require additional
capital buffers.

The sluggishness of the recovery in the years since
the recession of 2008-09 (see Graph I.19), can still
be seen in recent quarters. Since the beginning of
the recovery in the second quarter of 2013, growth
momentum has been rather low, with quarter-onquarter GDP growth rates hovering in a narrow
range of between 0.2% and 0.4% in the EU and
0.1% and 0.3% in the euro area. Six quarters into
the economic recovery, GDP still remained 0.6%
and 2.2% below the pre-crisis level of the first
quarter of 2008, in the EU and the euro area
respectively. As compared to previous recoveries
in Europe this is quite exceptional and it is also
different from recovery patterns elsewhere.
(22)

The reasons have been looked at in greater detail in the
autumn 2014 forecast; see European Commission (DG
ECFIN), European Economic Forecast – Autumn 2014,
European Economy, No. 7, November 2014, pp. 8–12.

23

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

In the third quarter of 2014, EU and euro-area
GDP grew by 0.3% and 0.2% respectively
(quarter-on-quarter). As throughout the year (see
Graph I.20), domestic demand has been the main
growth driver, mainly thanks to private
consumption. In line with increasing real gross
disposable income as well as improvements in the
labour market, private consumption continued to
accelerate. By contrast, gross fixed capital
formation (total investment) remained weak and
even contracted again in the euro area, while it
remained broadly stable in the EU in the third
quarter, held back by low demand, still low levels
of capacity utilisation, and rising geopolitical
tensions. Net exports detracted slightly from EU
growth in the third quarter and were neutral to
growth in the euro area. This was in line with the
role of domestic demand as the main growth driver
in 2014 (see Graph I.20).
Graph I.20: Real GDP growth and its components, EU

pps.

The first factor is the sharp fall in oil prices (see
Section I.1), which directly lowers the energy costs
for households and companies and should more
generally lift GDP growth in the EU. However, as
it occurs in an environment of only moderately
growing domestic demand, already very low
inflation rates, and nominal interest rates close to
zero, the overall effect may be smaller than under
more
regular
circumstances
when
the
disinflationary impact provides space for lower
nominal interest rates. Given the expected passthrough of lower oil prices to the economy, the
impact on economic activity should already have
set in last year and should continue over the
forecast horizon.

…but new factors brighten the outlook for the
EU economy...

While the economic recovery in the EU still lacked
growth momentum in 2014, new factors have
occurred in the last months that are expected to
brighten the outlook for 2015-16 as compared to
the counterfactual of a continuation of weak
economic momentum with weak investment,
headwinds from geopolitical tensions, and only
slowly diminishing growth impediments. The four
most promising new factors are the sharp fall in oil
prices, the depreciation of the euro, the newly
announced monetary policy measures in the euro
area, and the EU Investment Plan (‘Juncker Plan’).
While all of them have the potential to stimulate
economic activity, their impact on inflation differs
(see Section I.7). These four factors come on top

24

of those already identified before, (23) such as the
positive impact of last year’s Asset Quality
Review and the stress test on the financial sector
and lending, advances with the architecture of
economic and monetary union (e.g. Banking
Union), and some progress with structural reforms.

The second factor is the recent depreciation of the
euro, which has to a substantial extent occurred
vis-à-vis the US dollar but also been observed for
exchange rates vis-à-vis other currencies, lowering
the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro
particularly since late 2014. The depreciation is
expected to strengthen the price competitiveness of
euro area companies, thereby supporting their
exports and their relative position vis-à-vis foreign
competitors in euro area markets (see Box I.2).
The impact on exports to Member States outside
the monetary union and to non-EU countries is
expected to become visible in the coming quarters.
In assessing the overall impact, some limiting
factors have to be taken into account. Apart from
changing patterns in world trade (see also Box I.1),
the specific situation of exporters in countries with
close trade links to Russia might dampen the
impact. Moreover, empirical analyses suggest that
only around half of the change in exchange rates is
usually passed on to export prices and that the
growth of export markets is more important for
export growth than price competitiveness. (24)

The third factor is the Extended Asset Purchase
Programme (quantitative easing), which the ECB
announced on 22 January 2015 (see Section I.3).
The quantitative easing appears large enough to
expand the ECB balance sheet substantially (see
Graph I.21) and to have a tangible impact on wider
macroeconomic developments. The strong
signalling effect of the announcement should
support a re-anchoring of medium to long-term
inflation expectations in line with the ECB's aim of
achieving over the medium term inflation rates of
below, but close to 2%. The measures should help
to avoid an increase in real long-term interest rates,
facilitate the deleveraging process and improve the
funding conditions of companies. Stronger credit
growth and positive effects on business and
consumer confidence should support economic
activity and move inflation expectations and
inflation closer to the targeted levels. (25) The
positive impact on economic activity could
spillover to Member States outside the euro area as
the monetary union is one of their key export
markets.
(25)

To the extent that the portfolio effect of quantitative easing
makes investors buying assets denominated in foreign
currency, a further depreciation of the euro could result and
strengthen the aforementioned second factor for a
brightening economic outlook. However, the forecast is
based on technical assumptions for exchange rates, which
exclude such developments from being captured in the
central scenario. Thus, these effects constitute upside risks
to the projections (see Section I.9).

The fourth factor is the EU Investment Plan, which
was presented by the European Commission in
November. The plan aims to mobilise investments
of about EUR 315 bn. (about 2.5% of EU GDP)
between 2015 and 2017, in areas such as long-term
infrastructure projects but also projects of small
and medium-sized enterprises. As the plan will
take time to roll out and the benefits from such
investments may only be felt with a time lag, the
investment plan is expected to have a greater effect
in 2016 and 2017 than this year.
The positive impact of these four factors on
economic activity is in the near term expected to
be partly offset by remaining adverse factors such

…and limit the risk of entering a long period of
very low economic growth.

With economic growth still subdued, there are
concerns about the outlook for the EU economy, in
particular about the growth path that could be
reached during the forecast years and beyond.
Inspired by the experience of low growth
following the economic and financial crisis and the
longer-than-expected persistence of some growthdampening factors, the question arose as to
whether a period with very low growth or
stagnation was looming, or a period with a higher
GDP growth path could be reached. Secular
deficiency of aggregate demand in conjunction
with a very low or negative equilibrium real
interest rate (26), slowing technological progress,
ageing, debt overhang and other factors have been
referred to in the discussion of the economic
outlook.

the economic recovery can shed light on the EU

Leading indicators suggest that growth in the

(December 2014), confidence in these two sectors
stood above the long-term average in the EU, with
confidence in the construction sector back to its
pre-crisis level for the first time. In the euro area,
however, both indicators stood below the longterm average, whereas confidence in the
manufacturing sector remained broadly stable in
both regions in the fourth quarter.

Hard data for the fourth quarter corroborates the
picture of positive, but moderate economic growth.
In October and November, industrial production in
both the euro area and the EU stood on average
0.4% above the level recorded in the third quarter,
which had been the first quarter to show shrinking
industrial production in both the EU and the euro
area (-0.3% quarter on quarter) since the fourth
quarter of 2012. The expansion in industry is in
line with messages stemming from the survey
indicators.
With economic growth in 2014-Q4 continuing at
the rates already observed in the preceding quarter,
in 2014 annual GDP growth is expected to have
moved up to rates of 1.3% in the EU and 0.8% in
the euro area (see Graph I.23).

In line with the Commission surveys, the PMI
Composite for both the EU and the euro area also
declined in the fourth quarter of 2014 (see
Graph I.22), for the second consecutive quarter,
but remained slightly above the no-change
threshold. This was a result of a decline in
confidence in both the manufacturing and services
sector and points to a fall in economic momentum.

growth

Against the background of new positive factors
(e.g. lower oil prices, a weaker euro, a more
accommodative monetary policy, the EU
Investment Plan), the outlook for economic
activity is brightening, in particular as some of the
adverse factors currently weighing on GDP growth
should diminish and the implementation of
structural reforms should increasingly support the
conditions for domestic demand. In addition,
private consumption should benefit from
improving labour market conditions, whereas
private investment should see some increase as a
result of pent-up demand, after years of subdued
investment, and diminishing needs for balancesheet adjustment. Finally, exports should get
support from the strengthening of external demand
and from the depreciation of the euro.
Still some factors continue to weigh on the shortterm outlook. This includes the high
unemployment rates in some countries (see
Section I.6). Ongoing balance-sheet adjustment in
some countries continues keeping a lid on
economic growth, while improving the conditions
of economic growth in the longer term. While
deleveraging of firms and households is
progressing in many Member States, the
adjustment process still has a long way to go given
the magnitude of the debt increase before the
crisis.
Overall, real GDP is projected to grow by 1.7% in
the EU and by 1.3% in the euro area in 2015 and to
accelerate to 2.1% and 1.9% respectively in 2016.
These projections should be seen against the
background of the no-policy-change assumption.

Recovery is broadening across countries…

Rates of growth have always differed among
Member States of the EU and among those that use
the euro, but also in other constituencies. (29) The
different rates reflect country-specific structural
features, but also different growth trajectories (e.g.
catching-up in some Member States), and different
cyclical positions (e.g. between countries inside
and outside the euro area). The most recent data
for GDP growth suggest that the recovery in the
EU has continued to broaden, but output gaps
remain diverse (see Graph I.24).

In the third quarter, three countries still reported

Member States, economic growth resumed in
France and Germany (from -0.1% q-o-q in both
countries in 2014-Q2 to 0.3% in France and 0.1%
in Germany) and increased in Poland (from 0.7%

0.5%. Growth slowed in the UK (from 0.8% to

in Romania (1.8% q-o-q), Poland (0.9%), Malta

…but growth differences persist over the
forecast horizon.

Further out, as of this year, and for the first time

Member States should record positive GDP growth
rates. However, diversity in economic performance
is likely to persist since idiosyncratic features

ECFIN), Growth differences between EA Member States

shape the growth performance. They are also
related to different progress in tackling structural
weakness and implementing reforms. Most
recently, differences in the pass-through of lower
oil prices have become a differentiating factor. It
adds to other factors such as differences in
balance-sheet adjustment and deleveraging in the
private sector (30) and consolidation efforts in the
public sector.
Among the largest Member States, activity is
forecast to be dynamic in Poland, Spain and the
UK with growth rates well above the EU average.
While Poland had been the only country exhibiting
positive growth rates during the economic and
financial crisis and thereafter, growth in the UK
has been rather strong already since the end of
2008-09 recession with a moderate slowing in
2012. In Spain, the recovery had started last year,
supported by improved labour-market and
financing conditions.
Economic growth in Germany is expected to be
close to the EU average in 2015 and 2016, strongly
supported by domestic demand, which is expected
to grow faster than in the rest of the euro area but
with less assistance from net exports, which are
expected to decline and even turn negative in
2016. Economic activity in France is expected to
slowly gain momentum in 2015 and 2016,
primarily driven by household consumption while
investment is set to remain subdued this year. In
Italy, GDP growth is projected to turn positive this
year, driven by domestic demand and, to a lower
extent, net exports. Despite some improvement in
its housing market, deleveraging pressures in the
Netherlands will limit the potential for a faster
recovery.
Growth is expected to remain robust in Ireland
while the Cypriot economy is showing signs of
stabilisation. In Greece, policy uncertainty is
affecting confidence and the speed of the recovery.
The differences between countries are also visible
in changes in their contributions to economic
growth in the EU (see Graph I.25). Over the
forecast horizon, the largest contributions are
expected from Germany and the UK, whereas the
contributions of some other large economies
remain smaller than what their country weights
would suggest.

The weakness of gross fixed capital formation
has hampered the recovery…

Investment is a key factor for any economic
recovery as it builds up the productive capacity of
the economy and is crucial for the growth
potential. Therefore the lasting relative weakness
of gross fixed capital formation (total investment)
remains a key reason for subdued economic
growth. Historically, the current recovery in
investment is being considerably weaker even than
following previous financial crises. (31) Only
moderate growth of demand, low levels of capacity
utilisation, periods of heightened economic and
policy uncertainty, and, in some countries,
corporate deleveraging and financing constraints
are the main factors behind the weakness that has
continued last year. They are compounded by
regulatory bottlenecks in some sectors and
persisting overcapacity in the construction sector
of some Member States. (32)

remains below the long-term average in pre-crisis
years. This observation also applies to the total
investment-to-GDP ratio, which stood in the third
quarter at 19.5% in the EU and 19.6% in the euro
area. These levels were about 3 pps. (EU) and
3½ pps. (euro area) lower than before the
economic and financial crisis, but also 2.0 pps.
(EU) and 2.5 pps. (euro area) lower than the
average in the period between 1998 and 2007.
The weakness in investment remains broad based
across most EU countries, stemming from both
construction and equipment investment and from
the public as well as the private sector.
…but in 2015 equipment
expected to recover…

investment

Near-term equipment investment dynamics are
likely to remain subdued. Compared to the third
quarter of 2014, the industrial production of capital
goods in October and November, remained, on
average, unchanged in the EU and grew by only
0.2% in the euro area. Moreover, business
confidence has declined lately and the investment
survey in the manufacturing industry carried out
by the European Commission shows that firms
substantially cut their investment plans in 2014 in
both the EU and the euro area. For 2015,
companies in the EU expect a similar rate of
investment growth as in 2014. In the euro area,
investment growth is expected to be slightly higher
than in 2014.

In the third quarter of 2014, total investment
continued to contract in the euro area and remained
broadly stable in the EU after contracting in the
previous quarter. The breakdown shows that
investment in equipment fell in the euro area but
continued to grow in the EU, though at a slower
pace. Investment in construction continued to
decline in the euro area and remained broadly
stable in the EU after having contracted in the
previous quarter. The most obvious result of the
investment weakness is that not even the
investment levels of 2010 and 2011 have been
reached, which also implies that investment

Looking ahead, equipment investment is expected
to pick up more strongly from the second half of
2015 (see Graph I.26). Supportive factors should
include a gradual strengthening in domestic and
external demand, the lower production costs due to
the fall in energy prices, the need to renovate the

29

stock of capital combined with low interest rates,
and improved profit margins, particularly for
exporting firms due to the euro depreciation and
abating uncertainty. Moreover, the EU Investment
Plan should have a positive impact going forward.
Despite these supportive factors, some adverse
factors will continue weighing on equipment
investment, such as continued difficulties in
accessing funding for some companies in certain
Member States.

construction

The ongoing adjustment in housing markets
continues to have a negative impact on residential
investment but is expected to gradually fade over
the forecast horizon. Over the short term, growth
in construction investment should remain subdued.
Indeed, leading indicators such as building permits
in the euro area do not suggest any substantial
improvement in the coming quarters. Moreover,
the number of permits, which remains very low in
historical perspective, posted quarter-on-quarter
declines in both the second and third quarters of
2014. Also, the average construction output in
October-November was slightly below the average
of the first half of the year in both the EU and the
euro area. As regards confidence in the
construction sector, it continued to increase in the
last quarter of 2014 in both areas, but remained
below its long-term average in the euro area. In the
EU, however, the indicator rose above the longterm average in December 2014 for the first time
since the beginning of the economic and financial
crisis.

…and total investment is expected to
contribute stronger to economic growth mainly
in 2016.

After two years of contraction, total investment is
expected to have grown by 2.2% in the EU and
0.9% in the euro area in 2014. Investment growth
is expected to gain momentum as from the second
half of this year in both the EU and the euro area,
lifting the annual growth rate to 3.0% in the EU
and 2.0% in the euro area. In 2016, total
investment is expected to accelerate to 4.6% in the
EU and 4.4% in the euro area. The strong
acceleration should help bring total investment to
GDP closer to its average long-term average.
Private consumption remains the main growth
driver…

Private consumption has been the main engine of
growth in the current recovery both in terms of its
absolute contribution to GDP growth in the EU
and the euro area and in terms of the dynamics by
being the only large GDP component that has
permanently expanded since the beginning of the
recovery (Graph I.27). The upward movement has
been supported by relatively early improvements
in the labour market situation, by wage growth and
low inflation that have boosted real disposable
incomes. Among the factors that held back
consumption in some countries were the fallout of
previous house price declines and deleveraging
processes.

forecast

With the underlying correction gradually
vanishing, activity recovering, real disposable
income picking up and low mortgage rates,
construction investment is expected to grow again
in both areas in 2015 and to accelerate in 2016.
However, housing market corrections are set to
continue in several Member States (Cyprus, France
and Italy) in 2015, leading to shrinking
construction investment. In 2016, construction
investment is expected to rise again in all Member
States, except Hungary, due to the expected
negative impact of the decrease in EU fund inflows
on public construction investment.

HICP inflation (lhs)

…starting from moderate growth in 2014…

Survey indicators suggest that private consumption
expanded moderately in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In both the EU and the euro area, the
Commission’s Consumer Confidence indicator
declined in the fourth quarter, continuing the
decline observed in the third quarter. This mainly
reflects a more pessimistic assessment of the past
and expected general economic situation as well as
increased unemployment fears. But confidence
remained clearly above the long-term average and
the level observed in the first quarter. Moreover,
the monthly readings might suggest that within the
fourth quarter confidence rebounded and started
moving up in December. The sharp increase in
retail confidence in both areas in December is the
counterpart
to
this
observation.
These
developments appear to be closely associated with
the decline in energy prices, which are also
reflected in the low level of consumer’ price
expectations and the retail sector’s selling price
expectations. There are no indications that lower
consumer price inflation in 2014, or the fall into
negative territory in December 2014 is perceived
as an incentive to delay major purchases for further
price declines (see Graph I.28).
Hard data for the fourth quarter of 2014 support
the forecast for a continuation of moderate private
consumption growth. Retail sales stood in October
and November, on average, at 0.9% in the EU and
at 0.5% in the euro area, above the average level
recorded in the third quarter. Moreover, new
passenger car registrations in the euro area rose on
average by 0.7% q-o-q in October-November
compared to the third quarter. The forecast of
moderate private consumption growth in the fourth

Consumer major purchases (rhs, inverted)

…windfall income gains from lower oil prices
support consumption growth in 2015-16…

Lower energy prices are expected to remain a key
factor driving the expansion of private
consumption growth in 2015, given that only a
moderate rebound in oil prices is assumed.
Moreover, headwinds from deleveraging, low real
wage growth and limited access to consumer credit
are receding. With slightly improved employment
prospects and rising nominal compensation of
employees, including those at the lower end
(minimum wage introduction and/or increase),
nominal disposable income is expected to increase
further. It should also benefit from positive
developments in non-labour income (profit and
property related income). Very low consumer price
inflation should support real income, that, after a
few years of subdued developments, is expected to
grow faster than in recent years. This should
provide the basis for solid growth in consumer
spending.
The impact of higher real disposable incomes on
private consumption depends on households’
propensity to spend, which can be expected to be
emboldened by rising consumer confidence.
However, there are also reasons to expect a
moderate increase in household savings ratios (0.3
pp. in 2015 in both the EU and the euro area).
These include uncertainty about the persistence of
lower oil prices causing consumers to postpone
irreversible purchases of consumer durables, the
response to lower interest rates requiring larger
savings to reach previously targeted amounts (e.g.
related to ageing), but also ongoing deleveraging

31

as households in several Member States continue
lowering their debt burden. These factors more
than offset the precautionary dissaving effect that
could be associated with higher incomes and the
improved economic outlook. Overall, the moderate
increase in the savings ratio in the wake of an
increase in incomes is consistent with consumption
smoothing as suggested by empirical analyses of
households' consumption decisions.
All in all, private consumption is expected to grow
at rates of 1.9% and 1.8% in the EU in 2015 and
2016, and by 1.6% in both years in the euro area.
These rates are close to the average growth rates
observed in the years before the economic and
financial crisis (e.g. 2.1% in the EU and 1.5% in
the euro area in the years 2001-05).
...with differences among countries reflecting
pass-through rates and idiosyncratic features.

Developments in private consumption at the
aggregate level continue to mask substantial
differences between countries. The different share
of energy consumption in total private
consumption and differences in the taxation of
fuels result in a differentiated impact from the fall
in oil prices. The taxation differences relate to
national excise duties and value-added tax effects
in cases where the tax is levied as a percentage of
the pre-tax price plus the excise duty. Moreover,
high levels of household debt in some economies,
such as Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands,
continue to induce deleveraging in the household
sector, further limiting the pace of spending
growth.
Among the largest Member States, household
consumption is expected to grow by 2.0% or more
this year and next in Poland, Spain, the UK, and
Germany. Among the smaller Member States,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Malta,
Hungary, Romania and Sweden surpass the two
percent mark in both years.
Public consumption set to make a limited,
though positive contribution to growth

Government consumption continued to expand in
the third quarter of 2014. It grew by 0.4% in the
EU and by 0.3% in the euro area, contributing
about 0.1 pp. to GDP growth. Aggregate public
consumption growth is set to remain moderate in
the short term in both the EU and the euro area. In
2014, government consumption is projected to

32

have grown by 0.9% in the EU and by 0.7% in the
euro area. In 2015, public consumption is expected
to decelerate, with a few Member States even
seeing a decline. Further out, public consumption
is expected to accelerate in 2016 (see also
Section I.8). Declining volumes are still expected
in Cyprus, Greece, and Hungary in both 2015 and
2016. The forecast for 2016 should be seen against
the background of the no-policy change
assumption, according to which consolidation
measures are only factored in the forecast if they
have been adopted and presented to national
parliaments or are known in sufficient detail to be
taken into consideration.
Exports
benefitting
depreciation

slightly

from

euro

After a soft patch in the first half of the year,
exports of goods and services grew by 1.0% and
1.3% respectively in the EU and the euro area, in
the third quarter of 2014. In parallel, imports grew
by 1.3% and 1.4% respectively in the EU and the
euro area. All in all, net trade made a slightly
negative contribution to GDP growth in the EU
and was neutral in the case of the euro area.
For the near term, recent indicators are sending
mixed signals. Hard data show that in October and
November 2014, euro-area merchandise exports
were on average 1.1% above the monthly average
of the third quarter and the 3-month-on-3 month
growth rate increased in November from 0.8% to
1.7%. In line with this, the assessment of export
order books in the Commission’s manufacturing
survey improved in the fourth quarter of 2014,
compared to the previous quarter in both the EU
and the euro area.
The PMI component for new export orders in the
manufacturing sector, while remaining above the
expansionary threshold, has been declining for the
third consecutive quarter (see Graph I.29). While
diverging, both survey indicators stand at levels
consistent with positive, though moderate export
growth in the fourth quarter.
Against this background, in 2014, exports are
expected to have grown by 3.2% in the EU and by
3.6% in the euro area. The lower growth for the
EU reflects lower exports in the UK, which are the
result of adverse conditions in major export
markets. Because of strengthening domestic
demand and due to the high import content of
many export goods, imports are expected to have

EA and EU outlook

grown by 3.6% in both the EU and the euro area in
2014. Overall, net trade should have made a slight
positive (0.1 pp.) contribution to GDP growth in
the euro area and a slight negative (-0.1 pp.) in the
EU as a whole in 2014.

The current account balances of both the EU and
the euro area have moved from a broadly balanced
position to a sizeable surplus in recent years. The
sharp decline in oil prices since June is set to
further strengthen the current account surplus in
both regions over the forecast horizon. Still,
current account developments are masking
considerable asymmetries in the external sector
rebalancing across deficit and surplus economies.

Looking ahead, exports are expected to accelerate
in 2015 and even more so in 2016. The
acceleration in global output coupled with the euro
deprecation should boost export growth. The
positive impact of the euro’s depreciation is,
however, expected to be moderate (see Box I.2)
and heterogeneous across countries. In countries
with a relatively high share of inputs imported
from non-euro area countries (e.g. the Netherlands
and Ireland) the exchange-rate impact on export
volumes should be relatively small.(33) Another
differentiating factor are sanctions against Russia
and countermeasures, which are expected to have a
direct negative, though moderate, impact on EU
trade going forward with countries more affected
that have relatively strong trade links with Russia.
Overall, exports are forecast to grow by 4.1% and
4.3% in 2015 in the EU and euro area respectively
and to accelerate to 5.0% and 5.1% in 2016.
Imports are set to grow by 4.3% and 4.5% in the
EU and the euro area respectively in 2015 and to
accelerate to 5.4% and 5.7% respectively in 2016.
These rates of expansion imply that the
contribution of net exports of goods and services
remains slightly positive in the euro area in 2015,
before becoming flat, and to be flat in the EU in
both years.

The unwinding of external factors drive current
account imbalances…

Current account developments in 2014 have
reflected the gradual pass-through in the domestic
economy of the sharp fall in oil prices. Although
the overall impact is partially offset by the
depreciation of the euro and, to some extent, by
lower exports to oil-exporting countries(34), effects
from declining prices, mostly on the import side,
are set to increase the merchandise trade balance
further in the euro area (to 3.1% of GDP) and in
the EU (to 0.4% of GDP). The adjusted current
account balance is also expected to exhibit a
further widening surplus in 2014 in the euro area
(to 2.8% of GDP) and in the EU (to 1.3% of GDP).
At the Member-State level, the current account
surplus is expected to have widened in 2014 by
more than 0.5% of GDP only in euro-area
economies (Malta, Ireland, Slovenia, Italy and
Germany). The outlook for a widening surplus in
the EU is mainly due to shrinking deficits in the
UK and Poland, and the persistence of high
surpluses in Denmark and Sweden.
In 2015, the main driver of trade flows and
external balances should remain in place. In
particular the lower energy bill is expected to feed
into production costs but to have only a limited
effect on export prices. Export performance is
projected to improve in many Member States amid
cost competitiveness gains and favourable terms of
trade developments. Against this backdrop,
merchandise trade both in the EU and the euro area
will be boosted, although positive effects will be
partly mitigated by the rise in disposable incomes
that should boost private consumption and

THE CURRENT ACCOUNT

See the estimated elasticites in N. Balta et al., Member
State vulnerability to changes in the euro exchange rate,
Quarterly Report on the Euro Area, 2014, Vol. 13, No. 3,
pp. 27-33.

In its analyses of the current-account impact of lower oil
prices, the ECB concluded that the direct impact on the oil
import bill can be expected to dominate other effects; see
ECB, Effects of the oil price decline on the current account
of selected countries, Monthly Bulletin, May 2009, pp. 1013 (Box 1).

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

strengthen imports. Overall, the current account
balance is expected to improve further in about
two thirds of the Member States with
improvements of at least 0.7% of GDP in six
economies (Croatia, Lithuania, Italy, Spain,
Finland, and the Czech Republic). At the aggregate
level, these developments result in the outlook of a
further widening surplus in the adjusted current
account in the EU (1.6%) and the euro area (3.2%).
The widening of the surplus in the current account
is expected to come to a halt in 2016 on the back
of the assumed rebound in oil prices and the
expected pick-up in import growth, driven by the
expansion of private consumption and investment
in the EU and the euro area.

…and the rebalancing of the external sector is
still asymmetric.

Looking at the implications of the expected current
account developments for the ongoing rebalancing
process, a striking feature is that most net debtor
economies are expected to further improve their
current account position over the forecast horizon
amid positive windfall gains from lower oil prices
(see Graph I.30). This will amount to a sizeable
adjustment of their current account-to-GDP ratios
compared to pre-crisis levels. Country-specific
factors, however, such as the pace of price
adjustment, will differentiate the impact of lower
oil prices on the external sector.(35) In Portugal, the
current account is expected to move further into
surplus by 2016, while, in Cyprus, it will be
broadly balanced. In Spain, the current account
surplus is set to stabilise in 2016, albeit remaining

At the same time, the fall in oil prices is expected
to widen the current account surpluses of net
creditor countries. Both increased savings and low
investment growth are set to enhance substantially
the current account surplus in Germany. Sizeable

EA and EU outlook

current account surpluses are also projected for the
Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.
In cyclically-adjusted terms, the current accountto-GDP ratio is expected to mark an even higher
surplus in most net creditor countries over the
forecast horizon (see Table I.5). Structural factors
are therefore expected to unveil their dominant
role behind persistent current account surpluses.
By contrast, cyclical effects are at play when
disentangling the sizeable current account deficit
adjustments in net debtor economies. All in all,
labour cost developments, mostly in net debtor
countries, and the lack of reforms to address
deficient domestic demand and excess savings in
surplus economies are supporting the current
pattern of external sector rebalancing in the EU.

THE LABOUR MARKET

Since the beginning of the recovery, the EU
economy has made progress in recovering from the
loss of employment during the crises. Since mid2013, the improvement in labour market
conditions has been evident in falling
unemployment rates and increasing employment
growth in both the EU and the euro area. Given the
expected strengthening of economic growth over
the forecast horizon, the outlook for the labour
market remains positive with more employment
growth and a further decline in unemployment.
However, with growth momentum expected to
remain weak, unemployment is unlikely to fall
substantially. Thus, the recovery in the labour
market is progressing but still has some way to go.

to the rebound in economic activity marks a
difference from the usually lagged response of the
labour market to cyclical patterns. It can be
associated with cyclical and structural factors. The
double-dip recession could have created a rather
unique labour-market situation due to the only
moderate downward adjustment of hours worked.
The structural explanation could be seen in a
greater responsiveness of the labour market in the
wake of labour market reforms, such as
decentralised wage bargaining and more flexible
work arrangements (see also Box I.3). The pace of
the rebound could also reflect the positive impact
of past wage moderation.
...with further improvements in the third quarter
of 2014...

In the third quarter of 2014, employment grew by
0.2% (quarter-on-quarter) in the euro area and by
0.3% in the EU. (37) The annual growth rate of
employment stood at 0.6% in the euro area and
0.9% in the EU. In the EU, this was the highest
growth rate recorded since the beginning of the
economic and financial crisis (see Graph I.31).

net job creation recorded in the vast majority of
economic sectors. While the expansion was rather
strong in the services sector, it was more moderate
in EU industry (0.2%), with industrial employment
in the euro area industry still declining at a rate of
0.1%. For the first time since the economic and
financial crisis, also the construction sectors in the
EU and the euro area recorded net job creation
(0.2% and 0.1% q-o-q), which could be interpreted
as a signal of adjustment in the non-tradable sector
coming to an end. However, stronger employment
growth in tradable sectors continues, suggesting
that the reallocation of resources is still underway.
Unemployment rates had continued following a
moderate downward trend in the first half of 2014,
but then up to November, for a couple of months,
remained at about 10.0% of the labour force in the
EU and at about 11.5% in the euro area. Given
positive employment growth in recent quarters, the
persistence of unemployment rates can be
associated with developments in labour market
participation. As the recovery progressed,
participation rates have moved up (added-worker
effect) and kept unemployment rates almost
unchanged. Yet, compared to the peaks reached in
the first half of 2013, unemployment in the EU and
euro area fell by 0.9 pp and by 0.5 pp respectively
up to November 2014.
Unemployment rates differ markedly with respect
to the age of persons and the duration of
unemployment. The situation is particularly
difficult for young people and for those, which
have been unemployed for at least a year.
The unemployment rate of young people had
increased massively during the economic and
financial crisis and reached historical peaks in
several Member States. This reflected a greater
sensitivity
of
youth
unemployment
to
developments in economic activity than observed
for other age groups, the result of several factors

36

including labour market institutions. (38) As the
recovery progressed, the rate started to decline in
the second half of 2013, but this decline came to a
halt in recent months. Unemployment among
young people and even slightly increased in the
last months of 2014, being on average in October
and November 2014 higher than in the third
quarter of 2013 (at respectively 21.9% in the EU
and 23.7% in the euro area). Also in relation to the
age group, youth unemployment remains high (see
Graph I.32).

Long-term unemployment has fallen in the third
quarter of 2014, but the number of persons with
unemployment duration of more than 24 months
has almost steadily increased since the beginning
of the crisis in 2008 and seems to only start slowly
benefitting from the slight improvements that are
visible for other unemployment durations (see
Graph I.33). This increase in long-term
unemployment risks lowering matching efficiency
in the period ahead.

In the near term, labour markets are expected to

With growth expected to be too weak for a rapid
and massive absorption of excess capacities,
further improvements in the labour market are
forecast to be limited. In 2015, this is expected to
result in employment growth of 0.7% in both the
EU and the euro area, and a decline of
unemployment rates to below the 10%-level in the
EU (9.8%) and to 11.2% in the euro area.
More progress is foreseen from mid-2015 as the
recovery strengthens…

After having grown since the second quarter of
2013, employment expectations in industry and
services moderately fell in spring 2014 (see
Graph I.34) rebounding, albeit timidly, in
December. In the construction sector, employment
expectations continued to grow modestly in recent
quarters, but remain at very low levels. By
contrast, in the fourth quarter of 2014, hiring
intentions in services and industry in the euro area
stood slightly below the level of the previous
quarter. According to the latest survey readings
(December 2014), hiring intentions in the EU were
above their long-term averages in all sectors
covered by the surveys. In the euro area they
remained below the long-term average in the
services and construction sectors. Consumers’
unemployment fears had been steadily increasing
between May and September 2014 and have
moved in a narrow range since. So far, the more
optimistic view of households about the general
economic situation in the next twelve months has
not lowered their fears about unemployment.

The recovery of economic activity is expected to
trigger stronger job creation in the second half of
2015 and even more so in 2016. Moreover, major
recent reforms in the labour market, particularly in
the stressed countries and the moderate degree of
recent wage increases should both support job
creation over the forecast horizon. (39) On the
negative side, the relatively low levels of hours
worked compared to the pre-crisis period, could
continue to act as a drag on the employment
outlook. In 2016, employment is expected to grow
by 0.9 % in the EU and by 1.0 % in the euro area.
This uptick in employment growth follows the
narrowing of the (negative) output gap in both
areas and is thus broadly compatible with Okun's
law, which quantifies the relationship between
changes in output and the change in the
unemployment rate.

Overall, in 2014, employment gains are expected
to have partly offset the declines of the two
preceding years, reaching 0.9% in the EU and
0.5% in the euro area. The unemployment rate is
expected to have decreased to an average of 10.2%
in the EU and to 11.6% in the euro area.

market conditions, as well as the impact of positive
migration flows. The activity rate is expected to
increase slightly over the forecast horizon. Labour
productivity (output per person employed) is
expected to increase gradually over the forecast
horizon, reflecting the economic recovery and
some lagged response of employment to
developments in activity. In 2016, it is set to reach
1.2% and 0.9% in the EU and the euro area
respectively.
The unemployment rate in the EU and the euro
area is projected to decline somewhat over the
forecast horizon, to 9.3% and 10.6% respectively
in 2016, which is well above the average levels
observed between 2004 and 2008. The overall
slow decline in unemployment rates reflects
cyclical factors such as a not strong enough
recovery, but also the persistence of high structural
unemployment. The latter is reflected in the
historically high level of the NAWRU (Non
Accelerating Wage Rate of Unemployment),
which according to the Commission estimates has
been increasing since 2009 in both the EU (to
9.0% of the labour force in 2014) and the euro area
(to 9.9%). But meanwhile labour market reforms
enacted in various Member States after the
economic and financial crisis begin to bear fruit.
The NAWRU is expected to almost stabilise over
the forecast horizon, with a marginal changes in
the euro area (+0.1 pp.) and the EU (-0.1 pp.). (40)
…with improvements in all Member States,
including the ones suffering most from the

EU Member States started, with unemployment

Roeger, ibid, p. 24.

decreasing also in those Member States that had
recorded the highest increases following the
sovereign debt crisis (Greece, Spain, Portugal and
Cyprus). In November, unemployment rates in
those countries were considerably below their
summer 2013 peaks. By contrast, the
unemployment rate remained broadly stable in
low-unemployment countries (such as Germany,
Austria or Luxembourg). Looking ahead, labour
market differences are expected to continue
narrowing over the forecast horizon as the
recovery strengthens in most EU Member States.
Unemployment rates are expected to decrease in
2016 compared to 2014 in all EU countries except
Finland, Luxembourg, and Austria, but differences
in levels and in the pace of decline will remain
large. Unemployment rates are expected to range
from less than 5% in Germany to more than 20%
in Greece and Spain in 2016, reflecting the
persistence of large unemployment gaps. Recent
analysis suggest that the persistence of the large
unemployment differentials in the EU after the
crisis could spark cross-country labour mobility
within the single market, (41) affecting the labour
participation rates in the ‘sending’ and ‘receiving’
countries in opposite ways.

INFLATION

The downward trend of inflation continued in
recent months, with the sharp fall in energy prices
pushing inflation rates in December 2014 below
zero in the EU and the euro area. The outlook of
almost zero HICP inflation in 2015 reflects
substantially lower energy price levels compared
to 2014. The gradual narrowing of the output gap
and a substantially lower external value of the euro
are expected to have only a partial counter-effect,
(41)

See A. Arpaia et al., Labour mobility and labour market
adjustment in the EU, European Economy Economic Paper
no. 539, December 2014.

EA and EU outlook

with the other components of inflation remaining
generally weak throughout 2015.
The negative impact of lower energy prices is
expected to fade out, and even reverse, in 2016
when the impact of stronger domestic demand, the
depreciation of the euro and an assumed gradual
recovery in energy prices should push inflation
noticeably higher. One upshot of lower energy
prices is higher disposable income, which is
projected to have a positive impact on private
consumption helping to keep some pressure on
prices of consumer goods and services which are
reflected in core inflation rates, which have
remained relatively stable. Of particular concern is
the recent marked decline in medium-term and
longer-term inflation expectations derived from
financial markets although they remain firmly in
positive territory and have moved noticeably
upwards since the ECB’s announcement of
quantitative easing on 22 January.

but also steadily declining non-energy industrial
goods inflation, which can be attributed to low
input prices and declining import prices. In the
fourth quarter of 2014, core inflation stood at 0.8%
in the EU and 0.7% in the euro area, with services
inflation at 1.4% and 1.2% and inflation of nonenergy industrial goods at -0.2% and at -0.1%,
respectively.

Other components (core inflation) [pps.]

Inflation rates moved into negative territory…

Inflation was very low throughout 2014, with the
sharp decline of energy prices pushing headline
HICP inflation into negative territory in December.
Besides the impact of lower energy prices, the
persistence of low inflation can also be associated
with a confluence of other factors. First, the
decline in global commodity prices other than
energy, especially food prices, has played a
considerable role in lowering inflation, as seen in
sharp falls in unprocessed food prices. Second, in
the euro area the impact of the appreciation of the
euro against the US dollar earlier in 2014 kept
increases in import prices low until the euro
depreciation became more pronounced in the
second half of the year. Nonetheless, the
depreciation of the euro did not offset the impact
of the stronger fall in commodity prices since the
summer. Third, the remaining slack in the
economy and weak domestic demand have kept
underlying price pressures low, a fact also
reflected in the prices of services and non-energy
industrial goods.
Core inflation (all items excluding energy and
unprocessed food) resumed its decline in the fourth
quarter after it appeared to have stabilised around
1% in the first three quarters of 2014. It has been
on a gradual decline since 2012 in both the EU
(see Graph I.35) and the euro area. Low core
inflation reflects historically low services inflation
due to weak demand and contained wage pressures

HICP, all items

…with the fall in energy prices also affecting
external and producer prices…

External price pressures remained remarkably
weak in 2014 and have not recovered from the
already very low levels in 2013 thanks to the
decline in global commodity prices. Import prices
(measured by the deflator of goods imports) fell
again in 2014, by around 2% in both regions. In
the EU and the euro area, the assumed path for
global commodity prices is expected to drag down
import prices further in 2015, by around 1% in
both regions, with the euro depreciation partially
dampening the extent of decline. Import prices are
then expected to increase by around 1% in 2016 in
both regions, consistent with the assumption of a
lower external value of the euro.
At the industry level, output price pressures were
even more subdued as producer price inflation was
consistently and strongly negative throughout
2014. This was evident in producer prices for both
the domestic and non-domestic markets. These
developments essentially reflected the cheaper
inputs due to lower commodity prices but also
weak demand. In November, the annual rate of
producer price inflation stood at -1.8% in the EU
and -1.6% in the euro area, which was in particular
strongly driven down by the energy and nondurable consumer goods components. On the other
hand, the steep declines in intermediate goods

39

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

prices moderated, while capital goods prices
continued to recover in the second half of the year.
Likewise, durable consumer goods recovered and
were increasing by around 1% in the fourth
quarter, hinting at recovering prices in the final
stages of the production chain.
…but the recovery in the labour market will
support moderate wage growth.

While high unemployment rates in some Member
States are expected to keep a lid on wage
pressures, the recuperating employment growth
across the EU is projected to sustain positive but
moderate wage growth. Data until the third quarter
of 2014 do not indicate a slowing in the annual
growth rate of wages and salaries throughout the
year, but the growth in compensation per employee
is projected to have slowed to 1.6% in the EU and
1.4% in the euro area in 2014. Labour productivity
growth in 2014 is projected to be 0.4% in the EU
and 0.3% in the euro area. In 2015, compensation
per head is expected to increase 1.6% in the EU
and 1.3% in the euro area while labour
productivity is projected to grow by 0.9% and
0.7%, respectively. In 2016, wage growth is
expected to slightly increase. With wage growth
moderate but an increase in productivity growth
expected, the profile of unit labour cost is one of
diminishing growth rates. Unit labour costs are
projected to decline from 1.2% in 2014 to 0.7% in
2016 in the EU, and from 1.1% to 0.6% in the euro
area.
Inflation to fall further before increasing in
2016...

Expectations of future price developments play a
major role in the price-setting and wage-bargaining
behaviour of economic agents and thus are crucial
in explaining overall HICP inflation. Both shortand longer-term inflation expectations implied by
financial markets have continued to decline in
2014, especially since October when oil prices
declined steeply, but they have rebounded
noticeably since the ECB’s announcement of its
expanded asset purchase programme on 22
January. Nonetheless, inflation expectations still
signal low but positive inflation in the years ahead.
Inflation-linked swap rates at the one-yearforward-one-year-ahead horizon have fallen
steadily since October, dropping below 0.5% in
December but recovered to 0.7% in mid-January.
Also in mid-January, swap rates at the three-yearforward-three-year-ahead horizon would imply an

40

average inflation rate of 1.4% (taken at face value).
The widely watched five-year-forward-five-yearahead indicator recovered strongly from its low
point in January to reach a level at the time of
writing that suggests inflation of 1.8 %, a level
which minimises concerns about a possible deanchoring of inflation expectations (see
Graph I.36).

As regards the near term, the European
Commission’s survey indicators have been mixed.
Until December, consumers’ inflation expectations
in both the EU and the euro area continued to fall,
reaching their lowest levels in almost four years.
Industry selling price expectations fell strongly,
especially in November and December but the
negative reading is still far from the lowest levels
reached in 2009. While the readings of the
construction and retail sectors’ selling price
expectations remained in negative territory, the
trend has been improving somewhat, meaning that
fewer operators expect to reduce their prices. On
the other hand, since the second half of 2014 the
services sector has been increasingly expecting to
raise prices, suggesting that underlying price
pressures in the economy are not weakening across
the board.
The assumed path of commodity prices and, to a
less extent, the remaining slack in the economy is
expected to continue dampening the inflation
outlook for the rest of 2015. The steep decline in
energy prices in the second half of 2014 and the
assumed path of oil prices will entail negative
effects in the HICP energy component for most of
2015. This effect is expected to outweigh the
upward pressure on imported prices because of the
euro’s depreciation. Nonetheless the impact of the
lower euro and the narrowing of the output gap are
expected to limit declines in the other HICP
components. Overall, inflation rates are projected
to be negative in the first half of 2015 but to

EA and EU outlook

rebound towards 0.6% in the EU and 0.4% in the
euro area in the fourth quarter of 2015 (see
Graph I.37).
In 2016, a gradual increase in the assumed path for
both energy and non-energy commodity prices
should have the opposite effects, thus driving
inflation higher. This upward effect on the
inflation rate should work in tandem with
underlying price pressures building up due to
stronger domestic demand and the lower euro
filtering through to higher consumer prices.
However, due to the subdued pace of the recovery
in most Member States, some economic slack is
expected to remain which should keep headline
inflation at 1.5% in both regions in the fourth
quarter of 2016.

...with low inflation even in countries that
register relatively high economic growth.

The HICP aggregate hides inflation differentials
across EU Member States (see Graph I.38). In
2014, HICP inflation rates in the Member States
are expected to range from -1.6% in Bulgaria to
1.5% in Austria and the UK. In some Member
States, quarterly inflation rates were below zero for
most of 2014, especially in Portugal, Greece,
Slovakia and Bulgaria. In the first half of 2015,
more EU Member States are expected to see
negative inflation rates due to the sheer decline in
energy prices, before inflation rates should move
up again in 2016.
Such price adjustments should help restore
international price competitiveness, especially for
those countries undergoing a deep economic
restructuring, although such adjustment could
hinders relative price adjustment within the euro
area.

PUBLIC FINANCES IN THE EU

Headline deficits continue falling…

The significant fiscal effort undertaken since 2010
in the EU and the euro area is starting to bear
fruits. In 2014, the general government deficit is
projected to have reached 3.0% and 2.6% of GDP
respectively. This reflects both consolidation
measures implemented by Member States and the
improvements in the general economic situation.
For the first time since 2008, the EU headline
deficit is expected to have reached the Treaty
reference value, although the annual reduction of
about 0.3% of GDP in both the EU and the euro
area would be smaller than in the preceding year.
In 2015 and 2016, headline deficits are expected to
continue declining, supported by the further
progressing economic recovery. In 2015, the
headline deficit is projected to fall to 2.6% of GDP
in the EU and 2.2% of GDP in the euro area.
Under a no-policy-change assumption, general
government deficits are projected to decline to
2.2% and 1.9% of GDP in the EU and the euro
area in 2016 (Graph I.39).
…reflecting a broadly neutral fiscal stance in
2014 and 2015.

After a substantial adjustment over the past few
years, the fiscal policy stance is expected to have
been broadly neutral in 2014. Following the
sizeable decrease observed in the period 20112013, the structural deficit (i.e. the general
government deficit corrected for cyclical factors,
one-offs and other temporary measures) is
expected to have remained broadly stable in 2014
in the EU and slightly declined in the euro area.

Notwithstanding the envisaged broadly neutral
fiscal stance expected in 2014 and 2015, there are
important differences among countries. On
average, thirteen EU Member States are set to
improve their structural balances in these two
years (Graph I.40). For the vast majority of these
countries, this fiscal effort is expected to be lower
than 0.5% of GDP, with Ireland delivering the
highest average change in the structural balance
(0.7% of GDP) over 2014-15. In turn, the
remaining fifteen EU Member States are on
average expected to loosen their fiscal policies
over 2014-15 with a considerable loosening of
more than an average of 0.5% of GDP in five

set to have become its main driving factor as of
2014 in both the EU and the euro area.
The revenue-to-GDP ratio in the EU peaked at
45.4% in 2013 and is expected to gradually
decrease over the forecast horizon (see
Graph I.41). In the euro area, however, revenues
are projected to have still slightly increased to
46.6% of GDP in 2014, largely due to by broadbased higher revenues from indirect taxes
stemming from the acceleration of private
consumption. The revenue ratio in the euro area is
set to stabilise in 2015 and to decrease in 2016 on
the back of lower net social contributions. In a
number of countries, reforms to reduce the tax
wedge on labour are expected to contribute to this
effect and to play a role in raising employment and
supporting economic activity.

The expenditure-to-GDP ratio is projected to
remain on a downward path in the EU over the
forecast horizon, from 48.1% in 2014, to 47.0% in
2016, mainly benefiting from cost-containment in

public wages and lower interest expenditure, as
well as the operation of automatic stabilisers with
lower spending, owing to the expected
strengthening of economic activity. Similarly, the
expenditure ratio is also set to decrease in the euro
area, from 49.2% in 2014, to 48.3% in 2016,
mainly as a result of lower interest payments, as
well as cost-containment in public wages and, to a
lesser extent, public investment. Low and
decreasing public investment ratios are set to
weigh on GDP growth in the short run and to
reduce the medium-term growth potential.
…and public debt ratio peaking in 2015 in the
euro area.

The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to have
continued increasing in 2014, albeit at a slower
pace than in previous years, reaching 88.4% and
94.3% in the EU and the euro area respectively
(see Table I.8). In the euro area, the combined
debt-reducing effects of nominal growth and the
primary surplus are projected to be stronger than in
previous years. This is because the smaller debtreducing effect stemming from lower inflation has
been more than compensated by higher real GDP
growth, while also the primary balance improved
somewhat compared to 2013. On the other hand,
the interest burden on the high debt level keeps the
debt ratio on an upward path, even if interest rates
are at historically low levels and interest
expenditure has come down somewhat compared
to previous years.
In 2015, gross debt is forecast to slightly decrease
to 88.3% of GDP in the EU, while peaking at
94.4% of GDP in the euro area. The expected
continued increase in the primary surplus,

43

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

combined with a further strengthening of nominal
GDP growth – whereby the further decline in
inflation related, amongst others, to the low oil
prices is more than compensated by the further
gradual recovery of real GDP growth –, is set to
further contribute to the decline of the debt ratio.
However, all factors considered, the debt ratio is
still expected to rise in the euro area in 2015,
reflecting the impact of interest rate expenditure
despite their ongoing decline as a percentage of
GDP in the wake of a further decline in interest
rates. In 2016, the debt ratio is projected to fall,
mainly on the back of the projected pick-up in
inflation and accelerating economic activity.

RISKS

The uncertainty surrounding these projections is
substantial, as risks to growth and inflation have
recently changed composition and size. Downside
risks to the growth outlook from economic,
political and financial developments have
intensified since the autumn, but some new upside
risks have also emerged recently. Also new upside
and downside risks to the inflation outlook have
appeared since autumn.
The growth outlook is subject to considerable
uncertainty…

Downside risks to the outlook for the EU economy
include geo-political risks, which are still high as
tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict
could increase. The economic impact of sanctions
against Russia and its counter-sanctions could be
larger than expected, in particular as sanctions
could remain effective for longer than currently
assumed. Stronger negative effects on EU growth
could also emerge from further intensified
conflicts in the MENA region (including Iraq and
Syria).
In financial markets, the risk of renewed episodes
of financial volatility remains present and could
weigh on economic growth in the EU. Triggers
could be increased political uncertainty, for
instance associated with developments in Greece,
renewed
doubts
about
sovereign
debt
sustainability, in particular if nominal growth rates
stay low and policy reforms slow. Also, the
expected normalisation of monetary policy in the
US could increase global risk aversion that would
reduce the outlook for global growth and delay the
healing of financial frictions in the EU.

44

Delayed or only partial implementation of
structural, fiscal and institutional reforms by
Member States or at the EU level would be
detrimental for EU growth. Also, lower-thanexpected inflation could have a negative impact on
economic activity by making deleveraging more
difficult as the fall in inflation expectations raises
the real interest rate. This would lead to a decline
in private consumption and investment demand.
Risk of second-round effects are also non
negligible; they could materialise, in particular,
into slower wage growth.
Sluggish growth in the EU could turn into a long
period of very low growth. Medium-term
projections foreseeing a recovery of potential
growth are largely based on three assumptions. (42)
First, the high unemployment rate will not lead to
long-lasting hysteresis effects. Second, more than
half of the TFP growth decline since the crisis will
be recovered in the medium term. And third,
households and firms will make use of investment
opportunities as they arise, but will not benefit
from further reductions in capital cost. Under these
conditions protracted low growth would be
avoided.
However, looking at the supply-side factors, there
are two downside risks. First, hysteresis effects
could last longer than assumed. Second, the
projected recovery of trend TFP growth could not
occur or be postponed. On the demand side, the
risk is related to the debt overhang and
deleveraging needs in some euro-area countries,
which could remain high, particularly in an
environment of falling inflation. As a result, any
materialisation of these downside risks could push
the EU economy into a protracted period of low
growth and low inflation.
Upside risks to the growth outlook include a
stronger-than expected boost to EU growth and to
global growth from lower oil prices. Also, a
stronger-than-assumed depreciation of the euro,
possibly related to quantitative easing, would
further strengthen EU firms' price competitiveness
and have a more favourable impact on EU exports.
Another positive shock to EU exports could
originate
from
a
stronger-than-expected
acceleration of global output and/or global trade
(e.g. due to a higher-than-assumed trade intensity
of global growth). A faster-than-expected revival
of investment expansion could be induced by the
EU Investment Plan. Successful structural reforms
(42)

For a detailed analysis, see W. Roeger, ibid.

EA and EU outlook

could lead to a quicker-than-expected recovery in
labour markets, which would support disposable
incomes and thereby domestic demand.
Confidence and growth could also rebound if the
conflict in Ukraine eases.
Overall, the uncertainty around the growth
projections is larger than at the time of the autumn
forecast. This is visualised in the fan chart (see
Graph I.42) that depicts the probabilities
associated with various outcomes for euro-area
economic growth over the forecast horizon. While
the darkest area indicates the most likely
development, the shaded areas represent the
different probabilities of future economic growth
within the growth ranges given on the y-axis. As
downside risks have intensified, and new upside
risks have emerged, the fan chart remains skewed
towards the bottom.

…while new upside and downside risks to the
inflation outlook have appeared.

On the downside, risks to the inflation outlook
stem from a further fall in oil prices. With lower
oil and other commodity prices, inflation rates
could remain negative longer than expected. It
could also lead to negative indirect price effects,
which could add downside pressure on inflation
rates in the short-term. Moreover, long-term
market-based inflation expectations appear to have
recently become more responsive to economic
news and are currently at very low levels. A
protracted period of very low or negative inflation
would increase the risk of a further decline of
longer-term inflation expectations and of negative
second-round effects on income. If these risks
materialised, the probability of outright deflation
(i.e. a fall in prices in a self-sustaining and broadbased sense) would increase. However, the risk of
a deflationary spiral where lower inflation leads to
second round effects remains limited especially in
the context of improving domestic demand, a
lower euro making import prices higher and
further monetary policy easing.

On the upside, risks to the inflation outlook stem
from a further depreciation of the euro or from a
faster-than-expected recovery, which could add
positive price pressures. Also, upward pressures on
oil prices, for instance originating from reduced
exploration or continued unrest or military actions
in oil-exporting countries, could push inflation
higher than expected.

Box I.1: Understanding the weakness in global trade
World trade has been remarkably sluggish in recent
years. Annual trade growth slowed from an average
of some 6% per year in the period 1970-2007 to
only about 3% in 2008-2013. In contrast to the two
decades preceding the 2008 crisis, which saw trade
expand nearly twice as fast as GDP (1), elasticity of
trade with respect to economic growth has been
depressed since 2009, with trade expanding broadly
in line, or even less than global GDP (see Graph 1).

Lower global trade growth rates and trade
elasticities compared to past trends resulted in
recurrent downward revisions of trade forecasts,
including those of the European Commission
Downward revisions to trade have been partly
linked to disappointments in GDP growth, but
revisions to the trade outlook have been much
sharper than for GDP, reflecting the pronounced
drop in the observed elasticity of trade to GDP.
This box discusses some of the factors behind the
current weakness in trade, distinguishing between
those factors related to the weakness in global
demand since the crisis that will likely prove
(1)

Throughout the box, GDP aggregates are weighted
using PPP weights, while trade aggregates are
weighted using market exchange rates — to ensure
consistency with the forecast. While the consistent
use of market exchange rates for both aggregates
leads to a less pronounced decline in trade elasticity
in the recent period (due to lower exchange-rateweighted GDP growth), it does not change the
arguments developed in the box or conclusions, as
these refer predominantly to individual countries,
where weighting is not relevant.

temporary, and those factors which may be more
structural (and therefore permanent) in nature. (2)
Weak demand and geographical patterns of
trade weakness

While global trade has become significantly less
responsive to global output over the last 15 years,
the crisis intensified the decline, bringing the
elasticity from its peak of 2.6 in 1998 down to 0.8
in 2012/2013 (see Graph 1). This trend highlights
the potential role of both longer-term, structural
factors in addition to the cyclical downturn, in
explaining the changing patterns of global trade
flows.
However, the overall decline hides sizable regional
differences that may shed light on the role of the
various factors at play. A preliminary look at
regional elasticities calculated over 5-year periods
(see Graph 2) suggests that the responsiveness of
trade to GDP growth has varied widely across
countries and regions, with some showing a sharp
fall in elasticity and others a robust increase.
Elasticities have declined most in emerging Asia
(China, ASEAN), Latin America and the US, with
the downward trend evident even before the crisis.
Elasticity fell particularly sharply in the US —
from 3 (1999-2003) to 0.6 (2009-2013), and China
— from 2.0 to 1.0 over the same period. On the
other hand, the EU is the only major region where
elasticity, very high historically, actually grew in
the most recent period, reaching 3.5 on average in
2009-2013.
Developments in the US and China are particularly
significant for the global outlook, given the
importance of both countries for world trade
coupled with the discernible change in their trend
responsiveness of imports to output. Falling trade
elasticity in the US may be a longer-term
phenomenon, as the country makes progress
towards energy self-sufficiency. Moreover,
anecdotal evidence suggests that the pace of
international fragmentation of production fuelled
by American companies in the decade prior to the
crisis, slowed considerably (3), thereby contributing
to the trend decline in imports. The trade elasticity

Inevitably, given the relatively recent drop in the
elasticity of trade to GDP, empirical evidence is still
rather mixed and only very tentative conclusions can
be drawn on the implications for forecasts of trade
and the relationship between trade and GDP growth.

However, developments in global trade elasticity
reflect not only changes in regional elasticities but
also the changing geographical patterns of global
activity. The recent crisis hit advanced economies
with the highest shares in world trade
disproportionately hard, implying a sharp decrease
in their contribution to global trade flows. This is
particularly the case for the EU, whose contribution
to world trade elasticity has fallen sharply as weak
economic growth since the crisis has compounded
a three-decades’ long decline in global trade
shares. (5) Graph 3 presents the evolution of
contributions to world trade elasticity from three
major global players: the EU, US and China with
very different underlying dynamics. While the
EU’s contribution has gone down significantly over
the last two decades, this has been a result of a
sharp decline in the region’s weight in global
activity rather than its elasticity per se (see
Graph 2). On the other hand, the fall in the
contribution from the US is a result of both falling
weights, and a decline in the elasticity itself. By
contrast, the steady increase in the contribution

IMF (2015),‘What lies Behind the Global Trade
Slowdown?’ Global Economic Prospects, Jan 2015.
Global trade elasticity
can be decomposed as a
weighted average of n regional trade elasticites:

with weights equal to the product of regional trade
shares in total world trade and the ratio of regional
output growth to world output growth.

While the cyclical upturn will lead to a gradual
rebound in contributions from the highly-tradeintensive EU economies, it may not, however, be
enough to lift the US’ contribution, where a
structural change in responsiveness of growth to
trade seems to be underway.
Weak demand and shifts in composition

Another potential factor behind sluggish trade is
related to cyclical changes in the composition of
demand. Investment, the most trade-intensive
component of domestic demand, collapsed during
the crisis and has been persistently weak
throughout the recovery — particularly in advanced
economies. The investment shortfall has translated
directly into lower import demand, and given the
importance of the countries affected most, has
continued to act as a severe drag on global trade
flows.
Although cyclical factors weighing on global trade,
such as weak demand and a cyclical shortfall in
investment in advanced economies explain a
sizable portion of the current weakness in trade,
mounting evidence suggests that they cannot fully
explain the extent of the slowdown, especially
since 2012. A study by Constantinescu et al (2014)
finds that short-term factors (including weak
demand) were dominant during the crisis and the
first year of recovery, but their influence weakened
later between 2012-2013, when long-term,
structural components became relatively more
important. Similarly, a study by Boz et al (2014) (6)

finds that around half of the slowdown in trade can
be explained by cyclical factors with the remaining
half due to structural factors.

The potential role of global value chains

Trade patterns in the world economy have been
changing over the last few decades, reflecting new
production structures influenced by new
technologies, increased demand for product
diversification, and gradual integration of
economies into global production chains. This
trend supported by trade liberalisation and
decreasing transportation and telecommunication
costs, contributed to the rising importance of trade
to GDP in most economies, including the EU. Such
an economic environment has created increased
opportunities to reallocate parts of the domestic
production process abroad.
The increasing spread of global value chains
(GVCs) has been one of the most prominent
features of the global economy for the last three
decades. Production of goods and services is sliced
into stages so that inputs can be sourced from the
most efficient producers, who may be located
anywhere in the world. The dynamic development
of global supply chains before the crisis and
potentially some consolidation afterwards is one of
the structural factors that could partly explain the
current sluggishness in world trade.
China seems to have driven the structural shifts in
international trade since the 1990s. Foreign value
added (7) content of Chinese exports tripled from
11 % in 1995 to 33 % in 2009 (see Graph 4a),
reflecting China’s raising integration into GVCs.
The WTO accession of China in 2001 accelerated
this process, with the foreign content of its exports
increasing from 19 % in 2000 to 36 % in 2005.
However, the process reversed with the domestic
value added content of exports increasing slightly
between 2005 and 2009, suggesting that China has
been moving up the value chain. The participation
of the US in GVCs mirrors to some extent the
structural changes driven by China. The so called
‘forward participation in GVCs’ of the US (see
Graph 4b) increased up to 2005 but diminished
somewhat thereafter. The same is true for the EU.
These findings confirm that some structural shifts
within such value chains were already taking place
before the crisis.

Despite data limitations in global value terms for
the post-crisis period (8), it can be argued that given
the ongoing rebalancing of the Chinese economy,
the process has continued, lowering the
responsiveness of trade to GDP in the recent
period. Finally, the overall participation of the EU
in GVCs masks large differences between MS, but
it should be noted that the EU managed to develop
both global and regional value chains. Outsourcing
has been supported by the gradual economic
integration of countries in Central and Eastern
Europe since the mid-1990s. The more intense
trade flows of parts and components between
Member States should have contributed to stronger
trade responsiveness to growth. This is mirrored in
the increased trade elasticity in the EU in this
period as presented in the previous section.
To conclude, the proliferation of global value
chains, in particular in the 1990s, were likely
responsible for the strong global elasticity of trade
at that time. These dynamics, however, have
diminished since the mid-2000s and were
interrupted by the global crisis. Moreover, other
factors including volatile capital flows in the post(8)

crisis period point to the fact that the framework
conditions were not supportive to boost further
integration into global value chains.
Trade policy arguments

Trade policy arguments, including the slowdown in
multilateral trade liberalisation and new
protectionism after the crisis, are sometimes raised
in the context of the recent slowdown in
international trade dynamics. Indeed, relatively
little progress has been made in multilateral trade
negotiations over the last decade. This contrasts in
particular with the nineties, when significant cut in
tariff barriers was achieved.
Rising protectionism since the global crisis is
another argument put forward to explain the
underperformance of global trade. Several
initiatives focused on monitoring this phenomenon
have been put in place since the outbreak of the
financial crisis. (9) These regularly updated reports
point to an increase in the absolute number of
protectionist measures. (10)
Table 1:

of new trade-restrictive measures has continued to
rise, the overall trade policy response to the 2008
crisis has been contained and the multilateral
trading system seems to have acted as an effective
backstop against protectionism. (11)
All in all, lower dynamics in multilateral trade
liberalisation and subtle protectionism in the
aftermath of the global crisis could have added to
the sluggishness in global trade growth but their
exact impact is difficult to establish, given the
relatively short time period of the observed flatness
in global trade between 2012 and 2014.
Conclusions

Evidence presented in this box suggests that the
sharp downturn and drawn-out recovery in
advanced economies, has weighed heavily on
world trade (and trade elasiticities). However, as
the recovery progresses, demand for imports should
rebound. A good part of the weakness in
investment — the most trade-intensive GDP
component — also appears to be cyclical. As
growth firms in advanced economies, rebounding
investment is set to support trade flows.

Important caveats should be taken into account:
non-tariff barriers to trade, which are often the
biggest obstacles, are more difficult to quantify and
information provided to the WTO is often not
sufficient to assess their significance. Still, the
measures introduced after 2008 concern a limited
share of global trade. According to the 2014 WTO
report on G20 trade and investment measures,
import restrictive measures introduced since
October 2008, excluding those measures that have
been reported as terminated, are estimated to cover
around 4.1% of world merchandise imports and
5.2% of G-20 imports. Therefore, while the stock

The WTO produces two set of reports that give an
overview of protectionist measures introduced after
the crisis: the first set of reports published twice a
year covers all 160 WTO Members and the second
initiative (joint project with the OECD and
UNCTAD) covers G20 economies. The Global Trade
Alert developed by CEPR is another initiative that
complements the WTO effort in this respect, drawing
upon expertise from independent research institutes
in seven regions.
WTO, OECD and UNCTAD (2014) Report on G-20
trade and investment measures.

However, weak post-crisis demand explains only
part of the observed weakness in trade and
evidence grows of structural changes in the tradeto-GDP relationship, which may have begun to set
in before the crisis. The high responsiveness of
trade to output recorded in the 1990s and the first
half of the 2000s reflected, to a large extent, the
proliferation of global value chains and the
integration of China into the world economy. Trade
elasticity began to moderate in China from 2005
and failed to regain its impetus from the prior
period. As evidence is emerging that China’s role
in international supply chains matured in the mid2000s and its growth outlook moderates, the
country’s contribution to world trade is likely to be
less spectacular than in the past. Similarly, the
current weakness in trade elasticity in the US may
be a longer-term phenomenon.
These trends suggest a cautious approach to
forecasting a strong rebound in trade elasticities in
the near term. While the projected global recovery,
including in the EU, should gradually boost trade
growth, trade elasticities may not return to their
heights of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Box I.2: Impact of euro exchange rate movements
Fluctuations in nominal exchange rates affect the
economy through a number of channels. To the
extent that they impact on real exchange rates, they
may generate expenditure switching effects
between foreign and domestic goods both at home
and in trade partners, thus affecting net exports. To
the degree that nominal exchange rate changes are
absorbed by importers/exporters rather than passed
on to relative prices, they may affect firms’ profit
margins, with possible second-round effects on
investment.
In order to assess the impact of the euro's exchange
rate movements, this box first summarises recent
developments in the euro's exchange rate. It then
assesses individual Member States' exposure to the
euro's movements and discusses how global value
chains affect the link between exchange rates and
trade. Finally, the box analyses the impact of the
recent depreciation of the euro on prices in the euro
area and what it may imply for developments in
exports and GDP.
Recent exchange rate developments

Between spring 2014 and late January 2015, the
euro depreciated by almost 20% against the US
dollar and by about 10% against the British pound,
driven by increasingly diverging monetary policy
stances (1) and growth dynamics. Since 15 January,
the euro also depreciated by about 15% against the
Swiss franc, after the Swiss National Bank decided
to discontinue its exchange rate cap against the
euro. By contrast, monetary accommodation in
Japan limited the euro’s depreciation against the
yen, while the economic and political situation in
Russia caused the euro to appreciate by more than
50% against the Russian rouble.
In nominal-effective terms (2), the euro depreciated
by about 5% between its peak in March 2014 and
late January 2015 and is trading close to its longterm average (1999-2013). In real-effective terms,
the euro fell by some 4% from March to December
2014 (latest data available) to slightly below its
long-term average, as weak cost and price pressures
in the euro area added to nominal exchange rate-

induced gains in price competitiveness against noneuro area trading partners.
The exposure to exchange rate fluctuations
differs across Member States

The exposure of individual Member States to
movements in the euro’s exchange rate depends on
how much they trade with non-euro area countries,
the geographical orientation of such trade, and the
euro's movements against the respective trade
partners' currencies. While openness to non-euro
area countries identifies the share of the economy
that is exposed to currency fluctuations, the
changes in country-specific nominal-effective
exchange rates (NEERs) point to the direction and
size of the shock.
Exports to non-euro area countries (goods and
services) scaled to GDP are highest in Malta,
Luxembourg and Ireland, and lowest in Spain,
Portugal and France. Between March and
December 2014, strong trade ties to Russia resulted
in a significant appreciation of the NEER in
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (6–8%), and to a
lower extent in Finland and Slovenia (see Graph 1).
By contrast, more intensive trade with the US and
the UK explains the marked depreciation of the
NEER in Ireland (3%). Larger Member States such
as Germany, France, Italy and Spain with more
diversified trade exposures have experienced a
more modest depreciation of their NEERs over the
same period. Low inflation relative to trading
partners has increased the competitiveness of all
euro area Member States.

group and weighting methodology.

exposure to exchange rate fluctuations looks higher
than it is. On average, about one third of euro area
Member States’ gross exports consist of imported
inputs. The share of imported intermediate inputs
on gross exports of larger Member States is
typically lower than in smaller ones.

Global value-added data from 2009 show that in
value-added terms, i.e. discounting for imported
inputs, exports to non-euro area countries
contribute less than 15% to GDP in France, Greece,
Italy, Portugal, and Spain (see Graph 2). Domestic
demand and intra-euro area trade are more
dominant drivers of GDP in these countries.
However, in small economies such as Malta,
Luxembourg and Ireland, non-euro area trade
accounts for about 35% of GDP. Exports to noneuro area countries also account for a significant
share of GDP in several small Member States
which trade more intensively with Russia,
emerging market economies and EU Member
States that do not use the euro. These Member
States, which include Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, may be particularly vulnerable to the
recent exchange changes, given the strong
appreciation of the euro against the Russian rouble.
Exchange rate pass-through into prices

Economic studies show that the pass-through of
exchange rate changes to prices is incomplete and
has declined in recent decades. (3) This is explained
by intensified pricing-to-market behaviour of
exporting firms, local-currency pricing strategies,
easier access to financial hedging instruments, and
changes in the sectoral composition of trade. More
recently, and partly due to better data availability,
the role of imported intermediate inputs in
domestic production has gained attention. Amiti et
al (2014) show that large exporting firms also tend
to be the largest importers, which reduces the share
of the exchange rate change that is passed on to

Commission staff estimates for the euro area
largely confirm these results. (5) Econometric
results show that in all euro area Member States,
import prices react relatively quickly and strongly
to a persistent change in the NEER. On average, a
5% depreciation of the euro's NEER increases
import prices by some 4% after one year, with most
of the impact occurring in just one quarter.(6) By
contrast, it takes around three quarters until
changes in import prices are passed on to consumer
prices and the response is generally small, as final
goods prices incorporate substantial shares of
domestically produced inputs (retail, transport,
marketing costs). Yet the extent of the response of
consumer prices differs slightly across Member
States, partly because of different consumption
patterns (a high proportion of services in some
countries, a high proportion of energy in others).
On average, a 5% depreciation of the euro’s NEER
leads to an increase in euro area consumer prices of
about 0.3% after one year. (7) However, as
commodities are largely priced in US dollars and
the dollar has appreciated strongly, the impact of

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

Box (continued)

recent exchange rate changes on prices may be
larger than suggested by these estimates.

The potential impact on the broader economy also
depends on the degree of openness to trade.

Export prices in the euro area appear to be less
responsive to permanent changes in the NEER than
import prices. A 5% depreciation of the euro’s
NEER lowers export prices in foreign currencies by
about 2% after one year. The limited pass-through
of exchange rate changes to (foreign currency)
export prices may be partly explained by offsetting
effects from higher imported intermediate input
costs and partly by mark-up adjustments.

Second, the impact on Member States' real
economies also depends on how strongly export
demand responds to changes in relative prices.
Empirical evidence suggests that price elasticities
differ widely across countries and industries. For
example, the price elasticity of Germany's exports
is estimated to be smaller than that of other large
Member States (notably Italy and Spain). (9)
Through this channel, the depreciation of the euro
may support intra-euro area rebalancing. (10)

Impact on the real economy

To the extent that the depreciation of the euro leads
to higher import prices and lower export prices in
foreign currency, the expenditure switching effect
increases net exports and demand for domestic
goods. This has in turn a positive impact on
domestic investment and growth. In addition,
higher profits of exporting firms due to higher
demand or higher profit margins may stimulate
investment and support a reallocation of resources
from non-tradable to tradable sectors. Simulations
with the Commission's QUEST model suggest that
a 5% depreciation of the euro's NEER, which
roughly corresponds to the size of the depreciation
since March 2014, may increase real GDP in the
euro area by around 0.3% in the first year and
another 0.2% in the second year. (8)
As import prices typically react faster than trade
volumes to exchange rate changes, the immediate
impact of the depreciation of the euro on the
current account is expected to be negative in the
short term but should turn positive in the longer
term (J-curve effect on trade balance).

Third, external demand tends to be more decisive
for export performance than price competitiveness,
limiting the role of exchange rate as a driver of
exports. (11) In the current situation, the impact from
the euro’s appreciation against the Russian rouble
and the euro’s depreciation against the US dollar is
compounded by weak demand from emerging
markets and strong growth in the US, making it
difficult to disentangle the impact of the exchange
rate-induced change in price competitiveness from
the impact of external demand.
The recent exchange rate movements benefit
countries that export more to the US and the UK
and are relatively open such as Ireland. The exports
of Italy and Spain are estimated to respond
relatively strongly to currency depreciations,
though these countries are relatively closed
economies. At the other end of the spectrum,
countries that trade more with Russia, such as the
Baltic countries, are facing a negative shock due to
the weakening of the rouble.
(9)

In assessing the impact of the recent depreciation
on the euro area real economy, a number of
additional considerations are warranted:
First, the effects of current changes in the euro's
exchange rate can differ widely across Member
States, as some countries experienced a
depreciation of their NEERs, while others
experienced a notable appreciation (see Graph 1).
(8)

52

The size of the impact depends also on the underlying
drivers and the persistence of the exchange rate
shock. Therefore, quantitative estimates should be
interpreted with appropriate caution. The estimates
quoted above are based inter alia on monetary policy
divergences between major currency areas.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.3: Recent unemployment developments: a swift reaction to economic recovery
Labour market conditions started to improve
gradually in the second-half of 2013 and a
moderate but swift reduction in unemployment
continued up to the first half of 2014. Since
peaking in 2013, the unemployment rate has fallen
by about 1 pp. and 0.5 pp., respectively for the EU
and the euro area. In the EU, the share of
unemployed for less than 12-months (the shortterm unemployed) dropped from 67% of total
unemployed in 2009 to 53% of 2013, which is
below the average over the period 2000-07.
Conversely, the share of unemployed for 24months or longer increased substantially to reach
about 30% in 2014Q3. The timing of the decline in
unemployment broadly corresponds with that of the
economic recovery, which started in the second
quarter of 2013. Although growth did not pick up
in 2014, unemployment continued to decline. The
unemployment rate in the EU appears unusually
reactive to the weak economic recovery.
A synthetic indication of a swifter co-movement
between output and unemployment is provided by
the panel correlation between current changes in
the unemployment rate and GDP growth lagged by
up to three quarters (see Graph 1). The link
between current unemployment changes and
current and lagged by one quarter GDP growth has
become stronger in recent years. By contrast, the
correlation with GDP growth lagged by two and
three quarters has fallen.
Graph 1: Correlation of current unemployment
changes with GDP growth lagged up to three quarters

unemployment rates are predicted for each country
based on a (fixed-effect panel) Okun's Law
relationship over the period 1980-2012. For a large
number of countries the actual unemployment rate
appears to react earlier and stronger than expected
on the basis of the historical relationship between
changes in the unemployment rate and real growth
(see Graph 2). These results are robust to a
different specification of the Okun's law, allowing
the unemployment response to GDP growth to vary
across countries. Only for Italy and the Netherlands
in 2013, does the current unemployment rate
exceed the predicted values.
While the reasons for this unusual reaction of
unemployment cannot be assessed at length in this
box, a series of potential explanations can be put
forward. First, improved business confidence could
explain a drop in the job destruction rate, after a
period of protracted downsizing. A turnaround in
the economic sentiment indicator (ESI) was
recorded at the beginning of 2012 in some Member
States (most notably, Greece, Spain, Hungary and
the UK) and the improvement became more
widespread throughout the EU over the course of
the year. By the end of 2013, the ESI was back to
its pre-crisis average for about 13 countries, while
for a large number of the remaining countries the
indicator reached values above the 2008-14
average. Better economic sentiment was
accompanied by a drop in the job destruction rate
in all countries. A regression of the job destruction
rate (1) against the ESI reveals that an increase in
the sentiment indicator by 1% would have been
accompanied by a reduction in the job destruction
rate by 0.9% (adjusted R² 0.7) over the period
2000-07 and by 1.0% over the period 2008-14
(adjusted R² 0.8). Second, firms' operating margins
have been increasing as a consequence of the
substantial wage moderation observed in several
countries and sectors. Real wage moderation
continued in high unemployment countries during
the pick-up of the economic recovery. In

Correlations provide an indication of the strength
of the relationship, but do not capture the
magnitude of the impact of economic growth on
changes in unemployment. This analysis can be

that relates GDP growth to changes in
unemployment. For 2013 and 2014 the

Predicted on the basis of current GDP growth (country specific Okun's coefficients)

2012 and 2013, real wage growth lagged
productivity growth (i.e. falling real unit labour
costs) in a number of high unemployment
countries, including Spain, Cyprus and Greece.
This wage moderation during the recovery could be
seen as the result of pent-up wage adjustment
linked to downward wage rigidities at the onset of
the crisis. For some countries, it reflected also a
stronger response to labour market conditions as a
result of reforms of wage setting systems.
However, real unit labour costs are becoming less
responsive to the unemployment rate, as many
countries are recording negative growth rates in
real unit labour costs and the adjustment of nominal
wages becomes more difficult in a low inflation
environment, because of workers' resistance

reduction in the number of hours worked has been
a key adjustment mechanism in Europe, whereby
firms achieved labour cost savings while avoiding
excessive labour shedding during the recession.
After having rebounded throughout most of 2009
and 2010, hours continued to fall until 2013 and

0.3%. (2) This fall has been driven not only by an
increase in the share of part-time employment
(linked in particular to increased activity rates
among women), but also by a gradual reduction in
the number of usual weekly hours worked by fulltime workers. Factors explaining this reduction
include legislated reductions in standard working
hours, increased diversification of work schedules,
including non-standard and variable working hours
income effects at the household level related to the
increase in women’s activity rates and/or to a
higher emphasis on education partly related to
increasing returns to higher education. Thus, the
drop in hours worked observed since the 2008
recession can therefore be seen as an acceleration
of a long-term trends, and there is no reason to
expect a priori a substantial change of these
underlying trends. Fourth, low skilled workers were
disproportionately affected by job losses during the
recession. The ensuing capital deepening and a
(2)

shift in the employment structure favouring highskilled workers may have pushed productivity up,
stimulating labour demand. However, this effect
might have played a role only in high
unemployment countries such as Spain, Greece
and, to a lesser extent, Ireland. In these countries,
labour productivity has been expanding faster than
Total Factor Productivity (TFP), since 2008,
reflecting a surge in capital deepening which has
been at its sharpest since than 2 decades. By
contrast, the capital-labour ration has declined in
countries where labour hoarding prevailed.
Although these factors might have played a role in
determining a swift response of unemployment to
the cyclical recovery, in the long-term, employment
growth depends on medium-term growth prospects,
most notably on a pick-up of TFP growth and on
reducing the protracted capital gap related to low
investment rates in some Member States.

This is calculated as the coefficient of a trend in a
regression, over the period 2000Q1-2008Q4, of the
hours worked per employee in logarithms on a
constant and a linear trend.

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2015

Box I.4: Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
23 January. The forecast incorporates validated
public finance data as published in Eurostat's News
Release 158/2014 of 21 October 2014.
External assumptions

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 9 and 22 January) were used for exchange
and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption as regards exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.17
in 2015 and 2016. The average JPY/EUR is 137.73
in 2015 and 137.64 in 2016.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. Shortterm interest rates for the euro area are derived
from futures contracts. Long-term interest rates for
the euro area, as well as short- and long-term
interest rates for other Member States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are assumed to be 0.0% on average in
2015 and 0.1% in 2016 in the euro area. Long-term
euro area interest rates are assumed to be 0.5% on
average in 2015 and 0.7% in 2016.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also mostly
based on market conditions. According to futures
markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to be on
average 53.0 USD/bbl in 2015 and 61.5 USD/bbl in
2016. This corresponds to an oil price of
45.3 EUR/bbl in 2015 and 52.6 EUR/bbl in 2016.
Budgetary data

Data up to 2013 are based on data notified by
Member States to the European Commission on
1 October and validated by Eurostat on 21 October
2014. Eurostat has made no amendments to the
data reported by Member States.

For the forecast, measures in support of financial
stability have been recorded in line with the
Eurostat Decision of 15 July 2009. (1) Unless
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned,
capital injections known in sufficient detail have
been included in the forecast as financial
transactions, i.e. increasing the debt, but not the
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and
deposits are not included as government
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have
been called on at the time the forecast was
finalised. Note, however, that loans granted to
banks by the government, or by other entities
classified in the government sector, usually add to
government debt.
For 2015, the budgets adopted by the national
parliaments and all other measures credibly
announced and specified in sufficient detail are
taken into consideration. For 2016, the 'no-policychange' assumption used in the forecasts implies
the extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends
and the inclusion of measures that are known in
sufficient detail.
European aggregates for general government debt
in the forecast years 2014-16 are published on a
non-consolidated basis (i.e. not corrected for
intergovernmental loans). To ensure consistency in
the time series, historical data are also published on
the same basis. For 2013, this implies a debt-toGDP ratio in the euro area (EA18) which is 2.4 pps.
(1.7 pps. in the EU) higher than the consolidated
general government debt ratio published by
Eurostat in its news release 158/2014 of 21 October
2014. General government debt projections for
individual Member States in 2014-16 include the
impact of guarantees to the EFSF, (2) bilateral loans
to other Member States, and the participation in the
capital of the ESM as planned on the cut-off date of
the forecast (subject to approval).

EA and EU outlook

Box (continued)

ESA2010

The current forecast is based on the ESA2010
system of national accounts for all Member States,
the EU and the euro area aggregates.
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output
gaps

The number of working days may differ from one
year to another. The Commission's annual GDP
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.

However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited over the
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and
unadjusted annual growth rates differ only
marginally (by up to ±0.1 pp.). The calculation of
potential growth and the output gap does not adjust
for working days. Since the working-day effect is
considered as temporary, it should not affect the
cyclically-adjusted balances.

PART II
Prospects by individual economy

Member States

1. BELGIUM

Favourable external factors mitigate domestic weakness

Belgium’s economy is set to grow moderately by 1.1 % in 2015 and 1.4% in 2016. In the short term,
domestic activity should enjoy some support from falling oil prices, while competitiveness-enhancing
measures are expected to allow companies to take full benefit from rising external demand in 2016. The
fiscal deficit is expected to fall to 2.6% of GDP in 2015 and to 2.4% next year.
Economic activity grew by 0.3% in Q3-2014 and
overall growth is projected to have reached 1% last
year. While domestic factors constrain the outlook
for demand, external ones are expected to be more
supportive. These relate in particular to enfolding
energy price dynamics and stronger external
demand next year. At 1.1% this year and 1.4% in
2016, economic growth in Belgium is expected to
remain below pre-crisis levels.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Consumption buoyed by low inflation but
tempered in the long run by low wage growth

Household spending is forecast to broadly follow
disposable income. Yet, several parameters affect
the prospects for income growth in opposite ways.
In the short term, low oil prices and low inflation
in general should support real disposable income
growth. Therefore, consumption is expected to
grow by 1.0% in 2015, comparable to last year.
However, low inflation also translates into a
protracted period of low wage growth, all the more
as the government decided to temporarily suspend
wage indexation in order to improve the country's
external competitiveness. Wage growth has
already been decelerating for some time as a result
of the decision to freeze wages in real terms in
recent years. Also several small tax measures are
expected to negatively affect disposable income.
As a consequence of these changing dynamics,
consumption growth is estimated to fall back to
0.7% in 2016.

62

With respect to the labour market, a slow-paced
improvement is projected, in line with subdued
economic activity. An acceleration of job creation
in the private sector is expected to be partially
offset by reductions in public employment. Also
increases in the labour force, partly driven by a
series of activation measures, absorb part of the net
employment creation. Overall, the unemployment
rate is estimated to fall from a ten-year peak of
8.5% in 2014 to 8.3% in 2015 and 8.1% next year.
Mending competitiveness expected to assist
investment and export growth

Last year’s pick-up in total investment growth was
driven by temporary factors related to housing and
corporate investments. As a consequence, capital
formation is forecast to decelerate at the start of
2015. Rising capacity utilisation, a further easing
of already soft financing conditions, the
Investment Plan for Europe and improving
margins as a result of competitiveness measures,
are expected to gradually improve the outlook for
investment. As a result, capital formation would
become a key contributor to GDP growth in 2016.
Slow wage growth, reductions in social charges
and lower oil prices are expected to improve cost
competitiveness. This is reflected in terms of trade
gains and the decline of unit labour costs. This
should underpin export performance, especially as
external demand strengthens towards 2016. The
trade balance heads towards a modest surplus for
the first time since 2009.
Inflation to rebound gradually as of mid-2015

Headline inflation fell back to zero at the end of
2014 on the back of retreating energy prices with
core inflation still well above 1%. This downward
trend is set to continue with inflation turning
negative in coming quarters, followed by a slow
uptick in the second half of 2015 as the substantial
downward pressure by energy items gradually
fades and recent monetary easing measures start to
have result. Overall, the general price level would
rise by just 0.1% in 2015. Inflation is expected to

Member States, Belgium

rise above 1% again next year, with prices for most
components expected to display a stretched
slowdown given shy economic activity, stagnant
wage growth and international price developments.
Improving government balance

Belgium’s general government deficit is estimated
to have been 3.2% of GDP in 2014. Revenue
growth proved disappointing compared to standard
elasticities, among others due to a 0.2% of GDP
loss in dividend revenue from financial
corporations, while one-off factors such as a tax
regularisation had a positive impact of 0.3% of
GDP.
In 2015, the headline deficit is expected to
improve to 2.6% of GDP, thanks to recently taken
consolidation measures at all levels of government.
The main ones include cuts in the wage bill and
administrative expenditure of the federal and subfederal governments, a lower growth norm for
health care expenditure, tighter criteria for social
benefits and a postponement of the previously
announced reduction in social contributions, which
is offset by an increase in income tax deductions
for workers. Furthermore, the decline in interest
rates, as well as a lower reference rate for notional

interest deduction in corporate income taxation,
contribute 0.5 pp. of GDP to the improvement.
However, a decrease in one-off revenues (-0.3 pp.
of GDP), a decline in dividend income and
financial sector guarantee fees (-0.1 pp. of GDP),
and dynamic upward trends in social spending, in
particular pension expenditure, all have a negative
impact on the evolution of the government
balance. The structural balance is forecast to
improve by around ¾% of GDP in 2015.
In 2016, under the usual no-policy-change assumption, the headline deficit is expected to improve to
2.4% of GDP, mainly thanks to better cyclical
conditions. The additional impact of consolidation
measures and lower interest expenditure are
broadly offset by rising primary expenditure
trends. As a result, the structural balance is
projected to improve only slightly further in 2016.
The debt ratio is estimated to have reached 106%
of GDP at the end of 2014. With still weak
nominal growth in 2015 unlikely to offset the
impact of further deficit accumulation and stockflow adjustments, Belgium’s debt is projected to
hit almost 107% of GDP, before stabilising in
2016.

2. BULGARIA

Continued headwinds to growth

Real GDP growth is forecast to decline from 1.4% in 2014 to 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016. The main
constraints to the outlook relate to domestic demand, in particular investment and private consumption.
Inflation is expected to turn positive again at the end of 2015. After a sizeable weakening of the fiscal
position in 2014, the general government deficit is projected to improve to 3% of GDP in 2015.
Growth outlook remains subdued

In Q3-2014, economic output expanded at the
modest pace of 0.4%, partly driven by temporary
factors such as the stocking of inventories and a
stronger-than-expected outcome in agriculture. In
line with a slowdown in the country’s main trading
partners and persisting geopolitical tensions, net
external trade contributed negatively to growth in
2014. The weak economic performance registered
until the third quarter of 2014 is projected to have
continued in the fourth quarter, with leading
indicators such as industrial production providing
little evidence of more dynamic output growth in
the
short-term.
Disruptions
to
credit
intermediation,
following
the
confidence
deterioration in the domestic segment of the
banking sector, are expected to continue weighing
on domestic demand in 2015. Real GDP is
estimated to have increased by 1.4% in 2014 as a
whole, before moderating to 0.8% in 2015.
Economic growth is projected to slightly increase
to 1.0% at the end of the forecast horizon.

are expected to freeze or postpone investment
plans. As a result, private investment is projected
to remain weak in 2015-16.
The exporting sectors are forecast to benefit from
progressively improving external demand over the
two coming years. After being negative in 2014,
the contribution of net exports to overall growth is
expected to return positive in 2015 sustained by
modest gains in competitiveness. The current
account surplus is forecast to hover around 2% of
GDP by 2016.

Domestic demand is projected to slowdown

After recovering in 2014, private consumption is
expected to lose vigour in 2015-16 due to the
expected weak growth in real disposable income.
In 2015, household consumption is supported by
lower fuel costs. Stabilisation of labour market
conditions in 2014 will also be a supportive factor
going forward, but the decline in the working-age
population has already become a drag on
household disposable income and consumption. In
addition, fiscal tightening is likely to dampen the
outlook for consumer spending in 2015.
Following weak readings since the onset of the
financial crisis, investment has been recovering
since mid-2013. The rebound of gross fixed capital
formation in 2014 has been driven exclusively by
public investment, with the government increasing
its use of available EU funds. The public
investment outlook is set to turn negative in 2015,
as the programming period is coming to an end.

Unemployment rate (rhs)

Limited improvement for labour market

Having peaked at 13% in 2013, the unemployment
rate is expected to have retreated to 11.7% last
year, mainly due to the decline in the labour force,
whereas employment stabilised. While the number
of employment contracts fell in 2014, the number
of self-employed marginally increased, leaving
overall employment broadly unchanged. In a
context of subdued growth, employers are likely to
favour increasing productivity over job creation
throughout 2015. Unemployment is forecast to fall
to 10.4% by 2016, its lowest level since 2010.
Deflation to prevail until late 2015

In line with the deflationary trend since mid-2013,
Bulgaria recorded the strongest consumer price
decline in the EU in 2014, with the HICP at -1.6%.

Member States, Bulgaria

The strength of deflation is also explained by some
country-specific factors, most notably regarding
healthcare, telecommunication, transport and some
specific food price categories. Some of these
factors are of a temporary nature and their
contribution to deflation will fade in 2015. Going
forward, some country-specific factors are likely to
contribute to price increases such as the increase in
electricity prices by 10% as of October 2014 and a
scheduled hike in the tobacco excise in 2015.
Nevertheless, lower fuel costs are set to keep HICP
inflation largely negative until late 2015, with
HICP forecast at -0.4% in 2015. Inflation is
projected to pick up to 1% in 2016 once the effect
from oil prices fades.

Downside risks stem from the effectiveness of
budget execution, most notably the 10% cut in
personnel spending and the savings in healthcare
costs. However, the deficit could also turn out
smaller because of the government plans to make
changes to the pension system which would result
in redirecting some of the private "second" pillar
pension funds into the state system. This would
improve the general government deficit by the
volume of redirected pension contributions. In
2016, the deficit is set to remain broadly stable at
2.9% of GDP, based on a no-policy-change
assumption. In structural terms, the deficit is
estimated to improve by about ½ pp. of GDP in
2015 and slightly less in 2016.
The general government gross debt is forecast to
have increased rapidly from 18.3% in 2013 to
about 27% in 2014, reflecting financing needs for
the annual deficit, the measures to stabilise the
financial sector and also the roll-over of a large
bond maturing in January 2015. The forecast does
not include any potential further debt issuances to
support the financial sector. The debt ratio is
forecast to exceed 30% of GDP in 2016.

Fiscal stimulus in 2014, reversed in 2015

The general government deficit is projected to
have deteriorated from 1.2% in 2013 to 3.4% of
GDP in 2014, driven by expenditure overruns and
weaker-than-expected revenues in VAT, excises
and some non-tax categories. The consolidation
measures adopted with the 2015 budget are set to
improve the deficit to 3% of GDP in 2015.

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC

Rebound driven by domestic demand

Recent data from the Czech Republic confirm an ongoing economic recovery driven largely by domestic
demand. While consumption and investment are expected to have been the main sources of growth in
2014 and this trend forecast to continue, export growth, which was strong last year, is expected to ease.
The general government deficit is expected to deteriorate in 2015, largely due to discretionary measures
and increased public investment.
An ongoing recovery

The Czech economy returned to growth in 2014,
after two years of contraction. The rebound has
been driven by domestic demand factors, including
fixed capital investment, household consumption,
and a build-up of inventories. Recent soft data
suggest ongoing strength in domestic demand,
with confidence indicators continuing to rise
across sectors. Real GDP is expected to have
grown by 2.3% in 2014 and growth is forecast to
rise to 2.5% in 2015 and 2.6% in 2016.

Investment activity remains strong

Investment activity grew strongly in 2014, as the
domestic environment improved, foreign industrial
orders picked up and the government increased its
efforts to make use of expiring EU funds. This
latter factor is expected to lead to a further
acceleration in the growth of public investment in
2015. Residential construction activity is also
expected to pick up, as the oversupply in the
housing market starts getting absorbed. Corporate
investment, meanwhile, is expected to remain
robust over the forecast horizon. Gross fixed
capital formation is estimated to have grown by
3.4% in 2014 and expected to grow by 4.1% in
2015 but to fall back to 3.0% in 2016.

A weak contribution from net exports

Czech export volumes grew strongly in the first
half of 2014, thanks to a surge in new orders from
abroad, but growth has since softened due to the
ongoing weakness in the EU economy. Overall,
export volumes are estimated to have grown by
7.5% in 2014, somewhat less than import volumes,
which are estimated to have grown 8.2%,
reflecting the import-intensity of the Czech export
sector and strong investment activity. The trade
surplus has continued to grow strongly, however,
largely due to favourable price effects. Recent falls
in oil prices are expected to contribute to further
growth in the trade balance over the forecast
horizon. The contribution of net exports is forecast
to remain fairly neutral in 2015, amid ongoing

66

sluggishness in the EU economy, but to become
positive in 2016. Further economic weakness in
main trading partners poses a downside risk.

The strengthening of the Czech economy is
reflected in improving labour market conditions.
Unemployment fell to 5.9% in the third quarter of
2014 and employment is expected to have grown
by 0.4% in 2014. Wage growth has also been
strong, with compensation per employee
increasing by around 3% in 2014, a rate that is
expected to continue more or less at the same level
over the forecast horizon. The unemployment rate
is close to its long-term average and is unlikely to
fall much further. Improving labour market
conditions are feeding stronger household
consumption, which is forecast to grow by 1.4% in
2014, 1.9% in 2015 and 2.1% in 2016.
Renewed softness in inflation

The HICP rate was low in 2014, averaging 0.4%,
partly due to reductions in regulated prices at the
beginning of the year. The substantial decline in
oil prices in recent months is forecast to put
downward pressure on inflation over the forecast
horizon, although tighter labour market conditions

Member States, The Czech Republic

and an expansionary domestic monetary policy
should exert some upward pressure. The impact of
regulated prices and taxes is expected to be
broadly neutral over the forecast horizon. HICP
inflation is forecast to average 0.8% in 2015 and to
rise to 1.4% in 2016.
Government deficit to increase in 2015

The general government deficit is expected to have
reached -1.3% of GDP in 2014. Available cash
data for the central government budget indicate a
significantly
better-than-budgeted
outcome.
Revenues were boosted by strong VAT and
corporate tax receipts, the one-off sale of licences
to mobile operators and significantly higher capital
transfers from the EU. Expenditure growth
remained moderate due to lower-than-expected
social transfers and savings in intermediate
consumption. Public investment is forecast to have
risen significantly towards the end of 2014, mainly
due to higher absorption of EU funds.
The general government deficit is projected to
deteriorate to -2.0% of GDP in 2015 and the
structural balance to reach -1.6% of GDP. The
forecast for 2015 incorporates the budget law
adopted in December 2014. Expenditure growth is

expected to outpace revenue growth by almost
2 pps., implying a significant fiscal loosening.
Strong investment activity, while still significantly
lower than its pre-crisis peak, is mostly linked to
the absorption of EU funds from the 2007-13
programming period and to exceptional military
expenditure related to the lease of fighter jets.
Higher healthcare expenditure and a budgeted
increase in the public sector wage bill of 3.5 % is
projected to contribute to stronger government
consumption, while higher indexation of pensions
is forecast to increase social benefits. Government
revenue will likely be negatively affected by the
introduction of tax credits for pensioners and
families with two or more children as well as the
third (lower) VAT rate of 10%.
The forecasted improvement in the general
government balance to -1.5% of GDP in 2016 is
expected to come mainly from the better
macroeconomic environment and an expected drop
in public investment. The structural balance is
expected to remain broadly unchanged. The debtto-GDP ratio is forecast to drop by 1.6 pps.
between 2013 and 2014, due to higher involvement
of government financial assets in debt management
and higher nominal GDP growth. The ratio is
projected at around 45% in 2016.

4. DENMARK

Conditions in place for recovery to strengthen

After 5 years of very slow growth, the conditions now appear ripe for Denmark's economy to start
picking up steam. A high savings surplus in the private sector, low interest rates and low inflation,
growth in real disposable incomes and improved conditions in the labour market are expected to
translate into stronger growth in domestic demand.
Recovery expected to strengthen

Real GDP in Denmark is estimated to have grown
by 0.8% in 2014. The relatively weak annual GDP
growth rate reflects subdued growth in the first two
quarters of the year, while economic activity
picked up in the third quarter. Growth is estimated
to have been primarily driven by domestic
demand, while strong increase of imports has led
to a negative growth contribution from net exports.
GDP growth is forecast to increase from 0.8% in
2014 to 1.7% in 2015 and 2.1% in 2016.
Compared to the 2014 autumn forecast, expected
GDP growth has been kept unchanged in both
2014 and 2015, while 2016 remains broadly in line
with the previous forecast.
For the forecasting period, indicators point to a
strengthening of domestic demand. In particular,
there is a high savings surplus, especially in the
corporate sector. Household disposable income is
currently supported by growing real wages, low
interest rates, low inflation and improving labour
market conditions. After a steep increase in late
2013, consumer confidence has stayed high, in line
with levels before the financial crisis (see
Graph II.4.1).

Exports are projected to pick up gradually over the
forecast period, reflecting a slow recovery of the
European economy. Imports are expected to move
broadly in line with exports, so the effect of net
exports on growth should be more or less neutral.
After depreciating for most of the year, the
effective exchange rate of the krone has increased
over the last couple of months, reflecting the
depreciation of other Scandinavian currencies.
Since 2005, GDP growth has been negatively
influenced by a trend decline in North Sea oil and
gas production. As this is a very capital intensive
sector, it helps to explain why the labour market
has performed relatively well despite the weak
recovery of GDP. Over 2015 and 2016, the oil and
gas production in the North Sea is expected to
decrease at a significantly slower pace than in
recent years, so the drag on GDP growth is likely
to be weaker.
A gradually improving labour market

5

-7

recovery still appears to be fragile, with large
regional differences, a low level of sales and a high
average time on the market. Prices on apartments
in the largest cities have picked-up clearly over the
last two years, strengthening households’ balance
sheets and confidence.

The unemployment rate, which generally has been
edging downwards since spring 2012, has
remained broadly stable at 6.5% over the last three
quarters. The gradual improvement of the labour
market is expected to continue over the forecast
horizon with the average annual unemployment
rate projected to reach 6.4% in 2016. The pick-up
in employment since spring 2013 is expected to
continue reflecting the strengthening of economic
activity. Following a projected increase of 0.7% in
2014, employment is expected to grow by 0.6% in
2015 and 0.9% in 2016.
Inflation is forecast to rise gradually over the
forecast horizon, as the effect from the decline in
commodity prices tapers off and the economic
recovery strengthens. HICP inflation is expected to

Member States, Denmark

increase slowly from 0.3% in 2014 to 0.4% in
2015 and then to increase further to 1.6% in 2016.
Risks are broadly balanced

Macroeconomic risks to the forecast appear
broadly balanced and mainly related to
developments abroad. As a small and open
economy, domestic demand in Denmark cannot be
insulated from significant adverse developments
abroad. On a more positive note, there are risks
related to a possible release of pent-up demand in
private consumption and in business investments.
Fiscal outlook remains stable

The general government deficit of 1.1% of GDP in
2013 is projected to turn into a surplus of 1.8% in
2014. This is significantly better than forecast in
the autumn and primarily related to markedly
higher than expected revenues from a one-off
pension taxation measure and higher-thanexpected revenues from a pension yield tax.
In 2015, however, the fiscal balance is expected to
swing to a deficit of 2.8% of GDP and to remain
broadly at that level in 2016. The worsening of the

fiscal balance in 2015 is mainly due to lower oneoff revenues from the pension taxation measures
(expected to drop from 3% of GDP in 2014 to
0.8% of GDP in 2015) and from markedly lower
pension yield tax revenues. Public revenues are
also negatively influenced by the drop in oil prices,
reducing revenues from oil and gas production in
the North Sea. The current forecast points to a very
narrow margin to the 3% reference value of the
Treaty in both 2015 and 2016 (based on a no
policy-change assumption in 2016). A further
decrease in oil prices represents a negative risk in
this regard.
The structural balance is expected to deteriorate
from a surplus of about 1¼% of GDP in 2014 to a
deficit of around 1¾% and 1.5% of GDP in 2015
and 2016 respectively. For the case of Denmark,
the structural balance is to a large degree
influenced by very large and volatile revenue
items, such as revenues from oil and gas
production and from pension yield taxes, which are
not corrected for in the calculation of the structural
balance.
The general government gross debt level is
expected to decrease gradually from 45.1% of
GDP in 2013 to 43.6% in 2016.

5. GERMANY

Sluggish growth but improvement under way

Germany’s economic growth is expected to strengthen gradually with the support of a robust labour
market and favourable financing conditions underpinning domestic demand, and improving external
demand. The continued decline in oil prices should have a positive effect on growth but will also
temporarily significantly lower inflation. Corporate investment is forecast to resume hesitantly, while
public investment is expected to pick up further. The general government budget should remain in
surplus over the forecast horizon.
Gradual acceleration of growth

Investment upswing temporarily interrupted

Real GDP increased by 0.1 % (q-o-q, seasonally
and working-day adjusted) in the third quarter of
2014, after falling by 0.1 % in the previous quarter.
According to provisional official data, real GDP
rose by 1.5 % in 2014. Annual growth was mostly
driven by domestic demand, notably consumption,
while the turnaround in private investment was
interrupted in the second half of the year. Net
external trade contributed moderately to growth.

Private investment continued to decline in the third
quarter of 2014. While the preceding quarter’s
decrease can be largely attributed to some
corrections after a weather-related boost in
construction, the latest decline indicates an
interruption of the recovery which started in 2013.
Geopolitical tensions and concerns about
economic developments in important trading
partners have triggered a wait-and-see attitude
among firms and the negative output gap suggests
no need to expand production capacities in the near
term. However, as domestic and external demand
pick up and uncertainty eventually fades, corporate
investment should resume its recovery in 2015,
notably because of pent-up replacement
investment and investment in new product lines. It
bodes well, in this context, that domestic capital
goods orders have resumed their upward trend.
Housing investment is expected to moderate its
rapid pace of expansion. Public sector investment
is projected to gain momentum.

Indicators point towards an acceleration of
economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 and
beyond. For Q4-2014, a subdued expansion is
expected with small contributions from the
industrial production and service sectors. A
moderate increase in industry orders following
stagnation in the first three quarters of 2014,
together with the nascent brightening of firm’s
business expectations after a lengthy and strong
deterioration last year suggest that economic
activity may further strengthen in early 2015.
Helped by the robust labour market, favourable
financing conditions and an improving external
environment, including a significant boost from
falling oil prices, growth is forecast to gradually
regain momentum over the course of 2015. GDP is
expected to increase by a moderate 1.5 % in 2015,
helped also by more working days, and to
accelerate to a rate of 2.0 % in 2016.
Noticeable consumption growth underpinned
by a robust labour market and low inflation

Employment growth remained quite robust despite
relatively weak economic activity. Going forward,
the new general minimum wage may have some
negative employment effects. Private consumption
is forecast to grow noticeably thanks to low
interest rates, high net immigration and continued
real wage growth. The stronger-than-previouslyexpected decline in energy prices and
corresponding low inflation widen the scope for
increased consumption expenditures.

Exports are expected to grow robustly. Firm’s
export expectations have partly recovered and
industrial orders from abroad continued to rise.

Member States, Germany

Export growth should further rise along with
increasing demand growth in trading partners.
Import growth is underpinned by consumption
growth and the pick-up of investment. Despite the
broadly neutral contribution to growth of net
exports, the current account surplus should further
increase in 2015 as the fall in oil prices amplifies
improvements to the terms of trade.

long-term care services, public sector wage
increases, and a new childcare allowance.
Overall, taking into account the budget law for
2015 and the no-policy-change assumption, the
general government balance is expected to show a
small surplus in 2015 and 2016, and the structural
surplus remains steadily above 0.5 % of GDP. As a
result, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio is set to
decrease rapidly. The on-going winding up of ‘bad
banks’ could further reduce the debt stock.

Very low inflation due to declining oil prices

Declining oil prices are temporarily set to further
considerably reduce inflation. The marked
negative output gap might also limit price
pressures, while rising labour costs are expected to
uphold core inflation. Consumer prices are forecast
to rise only slightly by 0.1 % in 2015 and more
strongly by 1.6% in 2016.

6. ESTONIA

Withstanding the impact of the downturn in Russia

Estonia's economy is expected to defy regional tensions and reach growth of 2.3% in 2015 and 2.9% in
2016 as euro area demand gradually recovers. Unemployment continues to decline. With the budget
deficit expected to remain limited, Estonia's public debt should stay below 10% of GDP.
Slow recovery amid adverse external factors…

Despite economic weakness in its main trading
partners, Finland and Russia, Estonia's real GDP
grew 1.9% in 2014. Consumption remained the
main growth driver, while exports grew stronger
than expected (2%). Private consumption was led
by strong wage growth, higher pensions and lower
consumer price inflation. Investment activity fell
sharply in mid-2014, most likely due to negative
confidence effects from heightened geopolitical
tensions. Housing investment remained moderate,
supported by favourable financing conditions and
raising income.
…as investment activity remains weak…

GDP growth is forecast to remain at around 2% in
2015, but to reach 2.9% in 2016 as the global
outlook improves. Corporate investment, however,
is expected to suffer from lingering excess
capacity and continued uncertainties surrounding
the export outlook in 2015. In 2016, equipment
investment growth should rise to 6% in order to
meet growing external demand. A rise in the
number of buildings permits issued in mid-2014
suggests that housing investment should also pick
up over the coming quarters. Public investment is
expected to gradually start growing again in the
course of 2015, after disbursements under the EU’s
development fund programmes resume.

moderately, as banks remain cautious about the
private sector’s relatively high level of
indebtedness and macro-prudential restrictions for
housing loans enter into force in March 2015.
Trade surplus surprises on the upside

Net exports performed better than expected in
2014. Exports of electronics rose in the second half
of the year as exporters managed to mitigate the
negative impact of the crisis in Ukraine. The
growth of service imports meanwhile came almost
to a halt. Despite the downturn in Russia, this trend
is expected to continue, and the overall trade
balance should remain positive throughout the
forecast period, supported by a recovery in the
euro area demand from mid-2015.
Downside risks to the forecast could stem from a
further escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, which
would affect both trade flows with neighbouring
Russia and inflows of foreign direct investment.

Consumption growth is forecast to remain
vigorous, supported by strong growth in real
incomes and helped by income tax cuts and higher
family benefits in 2015. After moderating in 2014
along with output growth, nominal wage growth is
expected to regain pace at around 5.1% in 2016.
Real incomes should enjoy support from the

Unemployment in swift decline…

Labour supply constraints are increasing, as very
low birth rates and high emigration shrink
Estonia’s working age population, particularly in
its 19-35 age category and total employment. This
trend is expected to reduce the unemployment rate
to around 6% in 2016 down from 8.6% in 2013
and to exert upward pressure on wages. Labour
force participation remains high at close to 70%,

Member States, Estonia

and is set to remain stable over the forecast
horizon.
…while inflation surprises on the downside.

HICP inflation fell to 0.5% in 2014 largely
because of steep declines in international prices of
minerals and oil. At the same time, warm weather
and easier access to cheaper regional energy
networks resulted in lower electricity prices. The
recent decline in global oil prices, although partly
offset by the euro's depreciation against the US
dollar should bring inflation in 2015 to 0.4%,
much lower than projected in the autumn forecast.
In 2016, further excise tax and administrative price
increases, as well as continued high wage growth,
are expected to push inflation back to around
1.6%.
Budget deficits low and relatively stable

The general government deficit is projected to
decline marginally to 0.4% of GDP in 2014,
helped by solid growth in the consumption and
labour tax bases. Moreover, tax revenue collection
has benefited from the closure of tax fraud
schemes and the introduction of tax enhancing
measures in the second half of 2014.

In 2015, the deficit is projected to widen to 0.6%
of GDP as a result of both higher expenditures and
tax cuts included in the 2015 budget. The public
wage bill is expected to grow by more than 5%.
Additional social transfers are directed to
households, as child benefits are roughly set to
double and pensions are planned to increase
(by 5.9%). Moreover, across-the board tax relief
for labour and capital enter into force in January
2015. These measures are expected to be partially
compensated by additional dividend distribution
from state-owned enterprises, further increases in
indirect taxes and by cutting expenditure on nonpriority areas, e.g. roads. Assuming no change in
policy, the deficit is forecast to remain broadly
unchanged in 2016.
In structural terms, the fiscal deficit is forecast to
improve to around ¾% of GDP in 2014 and 2015.
In 2016, under a no-policy-change assumption, the
structural budgetary position is projected to worsen
by approximately ¼ pp. of GDP. Estonia's debt-toGDP ratio is expected to fall to 9.8% in 2014 and
about 9.5% thereafter, as nominal deficits of the
central government should be financed from
accumulated financial assets.

7. IRELAND

Resilient growth and fiscal progress

Ireland's economy is expected to remain resilient and to keep growing faster than the EU average.
Thanks to buoyant tax revenues, the deficit remains on a downward path despite considerable
overspending.
Growth slowed in the third quarter but is still set
to exceed expectations

Confirming the volatility of Ireland's national
accounts, real GDP growth fell close to zero in the
third quarter of 2014, after registering record
growth in the first half of the year. Nevertheless,
real GDP grew by 4.9% y-o-y in the first nine
months, setting the ground for a very solid rate of
annual growth, even if GDP growth in the fourth
quarter would turn out to be flat.
Economic growth has been driven primarily by net
exports, including from pharmaceutical companies,
which recovered from the expiration of patents last
year. To a significant extent, however, reported
exports are explained by a surge in contracted
production (43), the evolution of which is subject to
uncertainty. Investment has been volatile, due to
the influence of aircraft purchases and intellectual
property deals by multinationals. Yet, excluding
these components, investment is strong — up by
19.6% y-o-y in the first nine months of 2014.
Continued strength in net exports and investment
should bring real GDP growth to 4.8% in 2014, up
from 4.6% in the 2014 autumn forecast.
Household consumption to recover and growth
to continue

Consumption is forecast to gradually play a bigger
role in propelling growth in 2015. Contrary to
expectations, household spending did not pick up
significantly in real terms in 2014. However, this
sluggishness is to some extent due to statistical
effects. (44) Employment figures, retail sales and
tax receipts all point to a recovery in consumption.
The combined effect of rising wages and large falls
in energy prices should provide further stimulus to
(43)

(44)

74

Contracted production refers to goods produced abroad on
behalf of an entity resident in Ireland. The sale of goods is
recorded as an Irish export and inputs to production as Irish
imports. This production does not have the same impact in
jobs and tax revenues in Ireland as local production.
The deflator for private consumption rose significantly in
the first three quarters of 2014 due to rising estimates of
imputed rents.

consumption in 2015. Unemployment is expected
to decline, albeit more moderately than in 2014.
Rising demand should dispel deflationary worries
and inflation is forecast to be higher than the euroarea average, although uncertainty remains.
Overall, businesses and households remain focused
on debt reduction, which keeps demand for credit
subdued and weighs on domestic demand.
Domestic banks improved profitability in 2014 but
continue to deleverage and repair non-performing
loans, which reduces their capacity to make new
loans. Yet, in the near term, low credit growth
might not be a constraint for SMEs, which at this
stage mostly use retained earnings for financing.
The Irish economy will continue to benefit from its
base of multinational companies and its trade links
with the fast growing US economy. Net exports
should therefore continue to grow in 2015 and
2016, in spite of slowing growth in the UK and the
low growth in the euro-area.
Real GDP growth looks resilient in 2015 and 2016
but nearly 1.2 pps. lower than the exceptional
growth experienced in 2014. The main risks relate
to the strength of the euro-area and UK outlooks.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Despite overspending, the deficit continues to
fall thanks to buoyant tax revenue

The general government deficit is forecast to drop
to 4.0% of GDP in 2014, down from 5.7% in 2013.

Member States, Ireland

This reduction reflects the effects of buoyant
economic growth in 2014, additional windfall
revenues, lower interest expenditure and the effect
of the new ESA 2010 methodology. While our
estimate for the deficit is now 0.3 pp. higher than
in the autumn forecast, it still remains well below
the 5.1% target for 2014 recommended under the
Excessive Deficit Procedure.
Tax revenues increased by 9.2% y-o-y through
December. Income tax and VAT receipts similarly
increased, mirroring improvements in the labour
market and consumer confidence. However,
spending rose further at the end of 2014, mainly in
the healthcare sector. Unlike in previous years, this
overspending was not offset by savings elsewhere.
On top of the extra spending, the deferral of water
charges to the first quarter of 2015 and the frontloading of capital injections in Irish Water also
negatively affected the 2014 budget balance.
Finally, the settlement of a pension scheme, after a
ruling of the European Court of Justice, increases
the 2014 deficit by around 0.1% of GDP.

increases of around 0.5% of GDP planned in the
2015 budget and a supplementary budget passed in
December. Under a no-policy-change assumption
the deficit is expected at 3.1% of GDP in 2016.
Risks around fiscal projections mainly relate to the
durability of the favourable economic outlook and
to persisting spending pressures.
The structural deficit is forecast to decrease to
around 3.4% of GDP in 2015 and 2016, from 4.8%
of GDP in 2013.
Public debt is projected to fall to 107.9% of GDP
in 2016, down from 123.3% in 2013. This marked
improvement largely reflects the liquidation of the
Irish Banking Resolution Corporation (IBRC) (45),
along with the pick-up in growth.
(45)

With the transition from ESA95 to ESA2010, IBRC
became part of general government and retroactively raised
the level of general government debt in per cent of GDP.
However, the planned liquidation of IBRC (with IBRC
liabilities being repaid through the sale of the assets and
through the use of cash and other financial assets) initiated
in early 2013 will reverse this effect.

For 2015, the deficit is projected at 2.9% of GDP.
The forecast includes tax cuts and expenditure

Uncertainty clouds the recovery

Greece’s economy began to grow again in the second quarter of 2014, as private consumption
strengthened and net exports grew. But uncertainty on the direction of policies is affecting confidence
and may dent the speed of the recovery.
Growth at risk

After six years of recession, Greece’s economy
returned to growth in 2014. Real GDP increased
by 0.4% y-o-y in the second quarter of 2014 and
by 1.6% y-o-y in the third quarter, supported
mainly by rising private consumption and the
strong performance of exports, especially tourism
and shipping. Investment increased in the third
quarter of 2014 for the first time since 2008. The
growth momentum was fairly firm in the second
half of 2014, although the early election has
affected confidence and investment. After
strengthening in October and November, the
Economic Sentiment Indicator fell to 98.9 in
December, its lowest reading since April. Growth
in 2014 is estimated to turn out at 1.0% y-o-y in
real terms, but uncertainty is expected to weigh on
growth in the first quarter of 2015.
The forecast has been prepared on the basis of the
full implementation of programme commitments.
On this basis, private consumption should benefit
from the steep drop in oil prices and improvements
in household disposable income. Export growth is
expected to continue in 2015, on the back of the
euro’s depreciation, gains in competitiveness, and
continued improvements in the business
environment. Investment should grow markedly on
the assumption that the political environment
stabilises. Overall, real GDP is forecast to grow by
2.5% in 2015.
In 2016, real GDP growth is projected to
strengthen to 3.6%, as investment is expected to
gather momentum on the basis that agreed
structural reforms are implemented.
Greece’s current account deficit is projected to
drop to 2.0% of GDP in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015
before decreasing to 0.9% in 2016. The underlying
assumption is that external trade develops
sustainably, supported by continued structural and
institutional reforms.
After peaking in 2013, unemployment started to
fall in 2014 and is expected to have dropped to
26.6%, as a result of the creation of about 100,000

76

new jobs in the private sector. We project the
unemployment rate will fall to 25.0% in 2015 and
22.0% in 2016 as a result of sustained growth and
the success of employment programmes.
Consumer prices fell by 1.4% in 2014, reflecting
the fall in oil prices, lower labour costs, and the
healthier competition environment in the retail,
health and energy sectors. Inflation is expected to
remain in negative territory in 2015 due to the
continuing internal adjustment and low
international oil prices, and to become positive in
2016 as the recovery gains pace.
The balance of risks points to the downside due to
the uncertainty on the direction of policies, which
could produce a deeper and more lasting effect on
confidence, consumption and investment.

Public finances continue to improve

Greece’s overall fiscal outlook continues to
strengthen. The fiscal adjustment achieved in
recent years has significantly improved the fiscal
balance. In 2014, a primary balance surplus of
1.7% of GDP is forecast, based on the monthly
data up to November 2014.
The headline deficit - no longer impacted by the
large one-off effects of bank recapitalisations
recorded in 2012 and especially 2013 - is now
projected to fall to 2.5% of GDP in 2014.

Member States, Greece

Compared to the autumn forecast, the
government’s fiscal balance is expected to be
somewhat weaker in 2014 but stronger in 2015, as
profits from the national central bank‘s holdings of
Greek government bonds in 2014 (about 1.0% of
GDP) are now expected to be recorded in 2015.
The projections for 2015 and 2016 assume that
Greece will meet its programme’s primary surplus
targets, while the economic environment is
improving and fiscal adjustment continues. To
achieve the fiscal targets and complete the fifth
review, further measures need to be taken on top of
those foreseen in the budget adopted for 2015. If
the programme targets are met, Greece should
record a headline general government surplus of
1.1% and 1.6% of GDP in 2015 and 2016. The
structural balance has also turned into a substantial
surplus from a deep deficit in 2011. The
government’s debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
stabilise in 2014, before declining markedly in
2015 and 2016, as the primary surplus continues to
improve and the economy grows at a sustained
rhythm. Favourable interest rates together with the
back-loaded payment schedule for loans from the

European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) will
help to keep interest expenditure low for a long
period, despite the high stock of debt.
Risks to the fiscal outcomes are related to a
temporary deterioration of tax receipts around the
turn of the year reflecting uncertainty on the
implementation of the budget measures or from a
stronger deceleration of the economy.

9. SPAIN

Rising growth on the back of domestic demand

Spain’s economic growth is set to pick up as domestic demand benefits from an improving labour
market, easier financing conditions, greater confidence and lower oil prices. Net exports, by contrast,
are expected to dampen growth, although this effect will gradually diminish this year and next, as
Spain’s competitiveness improves. At the same time, the government deficit should continue to narrow.
After three years of recession, Spain’s economy
began to grow again in 2014 and seems to be
gathering momentum as labour market prospects
improve, financial conditions loosen, confidence
strengthens, economic uncertainty fades and
energy prices fall. These factors are expected to
sustain growth over the forecast horizon, despite
the continued drag from high levels of private and
public indebtedness and deleveraging. The speed
of the ongoing external adjustment, however, is
likely to slow.

including residential investment, is expected in
2015.

Domestic demand keeps driving growth

After having expanded by 0.5% q-o-q in both the
second and the third quarters of 2014, economic
activity is expected to have gained further
momentum in the last quarter, leading to an overall
GDP growth of 1.4% for 2014 as a whole. GDP
growth is projected to reach 2.3% in 2015 and
2.5% in 2016, mainly driven by domestic demand.
The sizeable drag from the external sector
observed over the first half of 2014 should narrow,
and net exports are expected to prove slightly
negative for growth in 2015 and turn neutral in
2016.
Recent hard data on activity and soft data from
confidence indicators both suggest that private
consumption remained quite resilient in the last
quarter of 2014. Such resilience is expected to
persist as a result of robust employment growth
and rising real gross disposable income, which
should also benefit from falling price levels
throughout most of 2015 and low inflation
thereafter. Lower precautionary savings are
forecast to reduce the households' saving rate
further in the short term. Households' leverage
ratios are set to keep falling as GDP and
disposable income expand.
Positive demand prospects, easing financing
conditions and the projected rebound in exports are
expected to underpin investment in equipment,
despite the ongoing balance-sheet correction of
non-financial corporations. After seven years of
adjustment, a modest pick-up in construction,

GDP (y-o-y%)

Exports are expected to accelerate during 2015,
backed by continued improvements in price and
non-price competitiveness and the projected
recovery in Spain's main export markets. At the
same time, after the sharp expansion in 2014,
imports are forecast to moderate slightly to align
with long-term final demand elasticities. The
current account is set to register a small deficit of
0.1% of GDP in 2014, but this should turn into
surpluses of some 0.5% thereafter, also due to the
impact of the decline in oil prices. In turn, net
external lending is expected to narrow sharply in
2014, to 0.3% of GDP, before rising again to
around 1.0% of GDP as of 2015.
Inflation is expected to have averaged -0.2% in
2014 and will remain negative in the short term,
also as a result of falling oil prices. Hence,
inflation is foreseen to fall to -1.0% in 2015. In
2016, however, inflation is forecast to turn
positive, but remain low, as the economy’s output
gap remains very negative.
Sustained employment growth

Having peaked at 26.9% of the workforce in the
first quarter of 2013, the unemployment rate
declined to 23.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Member States, Spain

Job creation gathered steam in the second half of
2014, while the size of the labour force continued
to contract. These positive trends are expected to
intensify over the forecast horizon, helped by
continued wage moderation and only modest
increases in nominal unit labour costs. With the
labour force contraction expected to fade slowly,
unemployment is forecast to fall to 20.7% in 2016.
The fall in oil prices and the monetary policy
interventions by the ECB could translate into
higher growth and less negative inflation than
assumed in this forecast, as they could push private
consumption and investment further.
Continued consolidation helped by recovery

Recent data indicates that public finances
continued improving in 2014, with the general
government deficit in the first three quarters of the
year reaching 3.6% of GDP, 0.6 pp. lower than last
year (net of bank recapitalisations). All in all, the
deficit for the year as a whole is expected to
narrow to around 5.6% of GDP, down from 6.3%
of GDP in 2013, net of bank recapitalisations in
both years.

Going forward, the reduction of the deficit is
relying mostly on the improving economic
outlook. The government deficit is expected to fall
to around 4.5% and 3.7% of GDP in 2015 and
2016, respectively, despite the impact from
recently implemented tax cuts. The reduction in
the deficit is held back by subdued nominal GDP
growth, which is acting as a drag on revenue
developments. Risks stem from uncertainty
regarding the impact of the tax reform on
revenues, contingent liabilities in the motorway
sector and implementation risks in an election
year.
While pension expenditures are forecast to
continue rising, falling unemployment should limit
the growth of social transfers in the near future.
Thanks to lower interest rates, interest expenditure
growth should moderate over the forecast horizon.
Spain's structural deficit is expected to widen by
about ¼ pp. per year in 2015 and 2016, reaching
2¾% in 2016. Still sizable budget deficits and low
nominal GDP growth are expected to push the
public debt ratio above 100% in 2015 and to
102.5% in 2016.

10. FRANCE

Signs of a moderate recovery ahead

France’s economic growth is forecast to slowly gain momentum in 2015 and 2016, primarily driven by
household consumption. Despite rising external demand and favourable terms of trade, the trade deficit
is unlikely to be significantly reduced over the forecast horizon. The government’s headline deficit is
expected to peak in 2014 at 4.3% before receding modestly in 2015, mainly as a result of additional
revenue measures.
Slowly coming out of stagnation

After three years of sluggish activity, the modest
rebound in GDP growth, driven by inventories and
public spending, in the third quarter of 2014 is
expected to bring France’s growth rate for the
whole year to a still disappointing 0.4%. The slight
improvement in business confidence suggests that
a timid recovery could take hold in 2015. Falling
energy prices should improve the financial position
of households and businesses, hence stimulating
activity. GDP growth is thus expected to
progressively gain traction and reach 1.0% in 2015
and 1.8% in 2016, under the usual no policy
change assumption.

measures to reduce labour costs, namely the ‘Tax
Credit for Competitiveness and Employment’
(CICE) and the 'Responsibility and Solidarity Pact'
(RSP), as well as the Juncker investment plan are
also expected to further boost investment from
2016 onwards.
No support from external trade

The expected rebound in world demand is
projected to give some impulse to exports from
2015, while the continued depreciation of the euro,
together with the CICE and the RSP, is expected to
reduce the pace of losses in export market shares
in the medium term, although without reversing
them. As a result, net exports will continue to
weigh on GDP growth over the forecast horizon,
as the rise in domestic demand leads to more
imports. Nevertheless, the external deficits are
expected to improve in 2014 and 2015 on the back
of favourable terms of trade, mostly reflecting the
fall in energy prices, before deteriorating again in
2016.

Increasing domestic demand

The gradual economic recovery is set to be mainly
driven by private consumption, the traditional
driver of the French economy. Dynamic wages,
low inflation, a reduced energy bill and recentlydecided tax cuts for low-income households should
support consumer spending. In addition,
households are expected to dip somewhat into their
savings in order to sustain their spending habits.
The acceleration in investment expected from 2015
will mainly be supported by the gradual recovery
of aggregate demand, against a background of
favourable credit conditions, reinforced by the
ECB's recently announced measures. The policy

Weak labour market conditions, low inflation

With the slow recovery, the labour cost reductions
associated with the CICE and the RSP are likely to
have only a limited positive impact on
employment in the short term. Therefore, over the
forecast horizon, these employment gains will be
insufficient to absorb the growth of the labour
force, and unemployment is therefore expected to
remain high.
Falling energy prices are projected to further
reduce inflation to zero in 2015. Prices are then set
to accelerate moderately and reach 1.0% in 2016,
as the output gap starts to dwindle and inflationary
pressures generated by the euro depreciation and
the ECB's new monetary policy are felt.
Balanced risks to the growth outlook

The impact of reduced labour costs on exporting
firms could be lower than expected, implying a

Member States, France

more negative effect on growth from the external
sector. On the other hand, the oil price fall could
have a stronger-than-anticipated impact on growth
and a forceful implementation of planned reforms
to improve competition in services (i.e. the draft
Law on Growth and Economic Activity) could
boost the economy further. Both factors would also
benefit the general government balance.
Measures have been taken to curb the
increase in the headline deficit in 2015

The general government deficit in 2014 is
expected to stand at 4.3% of GDP, 0.2 pp. above
the 2013 level. Current public revenues are
estimated to grow by 2.0% in 2014, compared to
3.3 % in 2013. Meanwhile, public expenditures are
projected to increase by 2.2% as savings have been
outweighed by the gradual ramp-up of the CICE.
Net of tax credits, expenditures are actually
estimated to have slowed down. Recent
information suggests that public investment by
local authorities may be lower than initially
expected, resulting in an overall contraction of
public investment. The – temporary − reduction in
France's contribution to the EU budget recorded in
2014 also contributes to the moderate expenditure
growth.

In 2015, the additional measures adopted after the
publication of the autumn forecast, together with
the improving macroeconomic outlook are set to
result in a decrease in the general government
deficit to 4.1% of GDP. Details of the package
presented by the government on 27 October have
been made public as part of the discussions on the
supplementary budget for 2014 and on the budget
for 2015. Furthermore, taking into account
additional information on expenditure cuts planned
for 2015 and recent developments in interest rates,
total public expenditures are expected to increase
by only 1.5%, a significant slowdown compared to
previous years.
Overall, the structural balance is expected to
improve by about ½ pp. of GDP in 2014 and ⅓ pp.
in 2015. Under a no-policy-change assumption, the
headline deficit in 2016 is set to remain at 4.1% of
GDP despite higher GDP growth as expenditure
cuts for that year remain largely unspecified.
Despite low interest rates on government bonds,
the still high government’s headline deficit and the
relatively modest nominal GDP growth are
expected to result in an increasing public
debt-to-GDP ratio. From 92.2% of GDP in 2013, it
is expected to reach 98.2% of GDP by 2016.

11. CROATIA

End of recession in sight, but recovery set to be muted

Croatia has spent six years in recession but the pace of contraction in 2014 was slower than it was in
the previous year. A mild recovery is now forecast for 2015, with growth set to reach 1% in 2016,
spurred by EU-funded investments. With the fall in energy and commodity prices, price dynamics are
expected to be negative in 2015, though inflation is set to regain positive ground in 2016. Labour
market conditions are set to improve marginally in 2015 and 2016. Fiscal consolidation needs and
limited structural reforms, however, continue to hold back potential growth.
Six years of recession

In the third quarter of 2014, real GDP contracted
by 0.6% y-o-y, a rate which is set to have abated in
the fourth quarter. Croatia’s economy contracted
for its sixth year in a row in 2014, but the pace of
the recession weakened over the course of the
year, bringing real GDP growth for the year to an
estimated -0.5%. According to the forecast,
positive demand from abroad was not enough to
offset the effect of weak domestic demand, which
fell as a result of a 3.6% fall in investment and
decreases in private and public consumption of
0.6% and 2.1% respectively.

neighbouring Slovenian economy, exports of
goods and services are set to increase at a more
moderate rate of 2.8%. At the same time, imports
are forecast to increase by 1.8%. Overall, the
current account surplus is set to expand to 2.4% of
GDP.

A muted recovery expected to start in 2015…

Croatia’s recession is forecast to come to an end in
2015, but real GDP is forecast to grow only
moderately by 0.2%. Domestic demand growth is
set to remain negative, as a result of a further
contraction of investment and government
consumption. Private consumption is now forecast
to stagnate as the negative impact of the weak
labour market and uncertainties related to the final
settlement of Swiss-franc indexed loans is broadly
offset by the positive impact of the income tax
reform and of lower oil prices. Although indicators
suggest that the labour market may have bottomed
out in 2014, employment is still expected to
stagnate in 2015, due to adverse demographic
trends, while the unemployment rate is set to
decrease to 16.8%, on the back of the contracting
labour force. Wages are expected to grow
moderately, due to the strong deceleration of
inflation in 2014 and the negative price dynamics
expected for 2015.
The feeble growth set to be achieved in 2015 is set
to come exclusively from net exports. After the
strong performance in 2014, partly reflecting large
one-off effects related to Croatia's accession to the
EU, the restoration of trade links with former
partners from the CEFTA and the recovery of the

…and gain ground in 2016.

In 2016, the recovery is expected to attain a tepid
1.0% thanks to an increase in domestic demand,
driven largely by EU-linked investments. Private
consumption should also add to growth as the
labour market stabilises. In particular, employment
is expected to increase on the back of a rise in the
activity rate and a decrease in the unemployment
rate to 16.4%. As a result of acceleration in
core inflation and attenuating private sector
deleveraging pressures, inflation is forecast to
pick-up to 1.0%.
Relatively stronger growth in the EU should
further stimulate exports, which are expected to
grow by 4.7%. Imports, meanwhile, are set to rise
by 4.5%, leading to a mild deterioration of the
trade balance, although the current account will
further improve on the back of current transfers
from the EU budget.

Member States, Croatia

Risks to growth projections are mainly negative
and related to uncertainties about fiscal policy and
structural reforms.
Consolidation efforts hindered by personal
income tax rebate

The general government deficit in 2014 is
expected to stand at 5.0% of GDP. Expenditure
appears to have evolved mostly in line with the
authorities’ plans, but some additional outlays
from
flood-related
reconstruction
costs
materialised in the second half of 2014. The
downward revision from the previous forecast is
mainly the result of a better revenue outturn (in
particular VAT).
In 2015, changes to the personal income taxes are
expected to push the budget deficit up to 5.5% of
GDP, as potential offsetting measures are still
largely unknown. In 2016, the deficit is forecast to
remain at around the same level, in spite of the
moderate pick-up in growth expected. The

structural deficit is expected to have reached 3½%
of GDP in 2014, and to deteriorate in 2015 and
2016, by about 1 and ½ pp. of GDP respectively.
The ratio of general government debt to GDP is
expected to have reached 81.4% in 2014, mainly as
result of the achieved budget deficit, continued
subdued nominal GDP growth and a pre-financing
operation planned before the end of the year. In
2015 and 2016 public debt is forecast to increase
further to 84.9% and 88.7% of GDP as a result of
the underlying deficit trends.
Negative fiscal risks are still present, including
from the accumulation of arrears in the hospital
sector and possible additional expenditure
slippages in 2015 in some other sectors, such as
education and transport. On the other hand, the
general government deficit forecast could be
revised downward if the government substantiates
its fiscal deficit targets by credibly announced and
sufficiently detailed measures.

12. ITALY

Waiting for recovery amid the low inflation environment

After contracting again in 2014, Italy's economy is expected to gradually recover this year, supported
by strengthening external demand. Inflation is projected to turn negative in 2015 due to the fall in oil
prices, high unemployment and weak domestic demand. The government deficit is expected at 3% of
GDP in 2014 and to decrease in 2015 and 2016.
External demand to drive economic growth

Over the first three quarters of 2014, real GDP
contracted by 0.4% year-on-year. Available
indicators for the last quarter point to a further
slight downturn in the manufacturing sector and no
contribution to growth from the service sector.
Hence, a further slight economic contraction is
anticipated for the fourth quarter, with real GDP
dropping by around 0.5% in 2014 as a whole.
In 2015, real GDP is expected to expand by 0.6%
supported by exports and only a mild improvement
in domestic demand. The expected increase in
households’ real disposable income stemming
from the decline in energy prices is forecast to
translate only partially into higher consumption. In
fact, labour market conditions remain poor and
many households need to restore savings that were
eroded during the crisis. The gradual decline in
nominal interest rates, albeit not fully translated in
real terms, is expected to support investment in
2015 and more significantly in 2016, when
equipment investment and construction are set to
pick up. External demand is projected to benefit
further from the lower euro, improved
competitiveness from lower unit labour cost
growth and improving global demand. Altogether,
real GDP growth is forecast at 1.3% in 2016.
Imports are expected to rise more slowly than
exports. This combined with lower oil prices
entails a further increase in the current account
surplus to 2.6% of GDP in 2015-16.
A possible delay in the revival of external demand
is the main downside risk to the growth forecast,
while the successful implementation of structural
reforms and of the EU Investment Plan represent
upside risks towards the end of the forecast
horizon.
Labour market prospects remain weak

After a significant fall in 2013, employment is
estimated to have declined only slightly in 2014.
Given the ample room for a recovery in hours
worked first, headcount employment is set to

84

increase mildly in 2015 and to strengthen only as
the recovery gathers strength later in 2016. With
more people joining the labour force, the
unemployment rate is forecast to remain at
historically high levels, with the risk of hysteresis
effect. Upward pressure on labour costs is forecast
to abate also thanks to the labour tax cuts included
in the 2015 budget, while labour productivity is
expected to improve somewhat. As a result,
nominal unit labour costs are expected to be
broadly stable over 2015 and 2016.

The sharp fall in oil prices entails negative
inflation in 2015

HICP inflation has been gradually decreasing since
the second half of 2012, driven by lower energy
prices but also weak domestic demand. In 2014,
the HICP increased by a slim 0.2% on a yearly
basis. The recent slump in oil prices is set to feed
quickly into lower energy prices, pushing headline
HICP inflation into negative territory in 2015.
Core inflation is set to stabilise at low but positive
levels. The no-policy change forecast for 2016
takes into account the hike in VAT rates that is
enshrined in the 2015 budget law to safeguard the
achievement of the fiscal targets. This measure
may be replaced by others of an equivalent
budgetary impact.

Member States, Italy

The government deficit at 3% in 2014 gradually
falling in the next two years

The government deficit is anticipated to have risen
to 3% of GDP in 2014, from 2.8% in 2013. A fall
in interest expenditure of 0.1 pp. of GDP, resulting
from lower yields, is set to have only partially
offset the expected erosion of the primary surplus.
Primary expenditure is projected to have increased
in nominal terms by less than 1% year-on-year,
also driven by tax credits to low-wage employees
recorded as social transfers. Revenues are set to
have increased marginally, thanks to higher intakes
from VAT and property taxation compensating for
a fall in corporate income taxes. In 2015, the
deficit is projected to decline to 2.6% of GDP,
supported by falling interest expenditure. In
nominal terms, primary expenditure is set to rise
only slightly. The government’s planned
expenditure savings affect both capital and current
expenditure trends, but the latter is projected to
slightly increase mainly because of income support
measures and the extended coverage of
unemployment benefits. Public wages remain
frozen. Despite the cut to the labour tax wedge, tax
revenues are expected to increase mainly due to a
recovery in corporate income taxes and higher
withholding taxes on financial income. In 2016,

under a no-policy change assumption, the deficit is
projected to narrow further. The structural balance
is set to improve by ¼ pp. of GDP in 2015.

In 2014, the debt-to-GDP ratio is anticipated to
have risen to around 132% as the primary surplus
was still insufficient to curb its growth, also due to
flat nominal growth and the settlement of trade
debt arrears. The debt ratio is set to peak in 2015
and decline in 2016 thanks to higher nominal
growth and primary surplus.

Signs of stabilisation amidst an unfavourable external environment

The economy is showing signs of stabilisation but the improvement in economic sentiment indicators has
come to a halt. While lower oil prices are expected to support growth, external demand will suffer from
headwinds from the Russian economy. Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue.
Note: The forecast figures for Cyprus will be
updated after the sixth review of Cyprus’
Economic Adjustment Programme has taken
place. While the text discusses recent
developments, data in the table are that of the
previous forecast.
The decline in GDP is close to bottoming out
towards the end of 2014…

Economic activity declined by 1.7% y-o-y in the
third quarter of 2014, a slight improvement relative
to the second quarter, driven by developments in
private consumption and investment. The annual
increase in private consumption is a noteworthy
development, but largely constitutes a base effect,
while investment was supported by a one-off large
purchase of transport equipment, which also
boosted imports. Excluding this transaction, the
growth momentum in both real imports and real
investment remained subdued. Real exports
weakened significantly in the third quarter, down
4.5% y-o-y, which associated with the temporary
pick-up in imports has worsened the current
account.
Unemployment has been flat hovering around
16%, with continued, albeit slower, contraction in
employment offset by a further fall in labour force.
Against the background of low capacity utilisation
and continued wage adjustment, inflationary
pressures remain weak. HICP inflation in 2014 has
been supported by prices of goods consumed by
tourists. Prices of goods consumed mostly by
residents have continued to fall and energy prices
fell strongly as well in end-2014.
…but economic sentiment and other shortterm indicators remain flat...

Economic sentiment remained broadly unchanged
in the second half of 2014, putting on hold the
improvement observed since April 2013. While
consumer confidence continued to improve,
business sentiment in most sectors weakened with
the exception of service sector confidence which
improved somewhat. Although retail trade
indicators suggest an improving growth

86

momentum in the short term, this is offset by
weakness in short-term indicators for credit and
tourist arrivals, in particular Russian tourists,
reflecting the negative economic developments in
Russia.
…pointing to a timid recovery in 2015 and
2016…

In 2015 and 2016, growth is forecast to resume
only gradually as private domestic demand slowly
picks up supported by lower energy prices. This
should be accompanied by gradual deleveraging of
both households and corporates and a reduction of
the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio (now at
close to 50%) down to more sustainable levels.
The moderate pick-up in domestic demand is
expected to be reflected into improved labour
market conditions, with unemployment starting to
ease gradually. HICP inflation is also expected to
remain low, weighed down by recent declines in
oil prices.

…with some of the downside risks already
starting to materialise.

Risks to the recovery are tilted to the downside. On
the domestic front, a failure to reduce the high
NPL ratios could lead to a more prolonged period
of tight credit supply conditions, stalling the
recovery of investment. On the external side,
negative economic developments in Russia are

Member States, Cyprus

likely to weigh on export growth in 2015, given
the sizeable trade links between Russia and
Cyprus. This negative effect is likely to dominate
the positive impact from lower oil price, leading to
downside risk to the GDP growth projection for
2015. Risks to the HICP inflation also remain on
the downside, largely due to lower energy prices.
Strong fiscal adjustment continues

In 2014, the general government headline and
primary balance are projected to improve sharply
by about 2% of GDP, on the back of further
consolidation measures. Revenue is expected to
increase compared to 2013, driven by
consolidation measures, high dividends from the
Central Bank of Cyprus, and improved tax
collection. Together, these factors should more
than offset the negative impact of slowing
economic activity on income and wealth taxes
proceeds. Total expenditure is expected to remain
on a decreasing path, despite an adverse impact
due to called government guarantees. This largely
reflects tight expenditure control, measures under
Cyprus’ economic adjustment programme to
reduce the public sector wage bill, and a

moderation of early retirements in the public
sector, which reduced the cost of lump-sum
pension payments.
The general government deficit is expected to
stabilise in 2015 and to decrease significantly in
2016, as better economic conditions should have a
positive impact on revenues. Further consolidation
efforts needed under the economic adjustment
programme should support these developments.
The projections include dividend income from the
Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) expected to amount
to about 0.6% of GDP in both 2015 and 2016, to
be distributed in line with the CBC's duties under
the Treaties (on the European Union and the
Functioning of the European Union) and the ESCB
and ECB Statute.
Cyprus' debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak in
2015 and to decline afterwards, supported by the
economic recovery and the fiscal performance.
Compared to the previous forecast, the
debt-to-GDP ratio is positively affected by the
upward revision of nominal GDP by about 10%
due to the transition to ESA2010 and other
statistical benchmark revisions.

Solid outlook despite external shocks

Following a slowdown in 2014, Latvia’s economic growth is expected to pick up again in 2015 and
2016 despite a multitude of external shocks, which are rebalancing the country’s growth towards
domestic demand. Unemployment is set to drop further but steep wage rises are already posing risks to
labour demand and competitiveness. Both the budget deficit and public debt are expected to decline.
Growth outlook remains positive

Latvia’s economy is facing both positive and
negative external shocks. While domestic
consumption is set to benefit from the recent drop
in oil prices, exporters are being hit by the
depreciation of the Russian rouble. Overall,
economic growth expectations remain unchanged
from the previous forecast at 2.6% in 2014, 2.9%
in 2015, and 3.6% in 2016. Risks remain tilted to
the downside, due to the high uncertainty of the
external environment.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Domestic demand regains speed

Domestic demand is projected to be the key
growth driver. After slowing down somewhat in
2014, the latest data show that private consumption
is accelerating again, supported by wage growth
and cheaper oil. Fuel accounts for about 6% of
household spending, which means that the recent
fall in oil prices should provide a significant boost
to consumers’ disposable incomes and demand.
This is corroborated by both retail trade and
consumer sentiment indicators for the last quarter
of 2014. Investment growth is expected to improve
in 2015 and further on in 2016 when geopolitical
risks are expected to subside.
Imports to grow faster than exports

Latvia’s terms of trade will benefit substantially
from the decline in crude oil prices. On the other
hand, the sharp depreciation of the Russian rouble

88

is adversely affecting exporters. About 11% of the
country’s exports are directed to Russia and there
is also some indirect exposure through other
trading partners affected by the depreciation of the
rouble. All in all, imports are set to rise faster than
exports in volume terms but the current account
deficit is likely to remain relatively small due to
the price benefits in the nominal trade values.
Wage growth weakens job creation

Employment remained flat in 2014 as wage
growth, economic slowdown and external demand
risks weakened the demand for labour. Real wages
increased by nearly 15% on a cumulative basis
over 2013 and 2014, while government
commitments for further minimum wage hikes are
set to further increase labour costs. Nevertheless,
unemployment is expected to keep falling from
around 11% in 2014 to 9.2% in 2016 amid further
contraction in the labour force and some rebound
in labour demand. However, the projected increase
in unit labour costs is posing some risks to the
country’s competitiveness in the medium run and
the minimum wage hike may also weaken demand
for low-skill labour in poor regions of the country.
Oil prices keep inflation low

Reflecting oil price effects, the inflation forecast
(HICP) is revised downwards to 0.9% in 2015 and
1.9% in 2016, down by nearly 1 pp. from the
previous forecast. The disinflation impact will be
channelled mostly through fuel and transport
services in 2015, while lagged effects to natural
gas and heating prices will affect the figures for
2016 as well. Nevertheless, inflation is set to
exceed the reported rate of 0.7% in 2014, as
service prices are pushed up by strong wage
growth. Furthermore, the deregulation of
household electricity prices, which commenced in
January 2015, has triggered a one-off hike after a
long price freeze on the market.
Fiscal performance withstands challenges

The 2014 government deficit is estimated at 1.5%
of GDP, based on preliminary data. Despite

Member States, Latvia

headwinds, overall tax revenues were only slightly
behind the target set in the 2014 stability
programme. A shortfall in corporate income tax
was compensated by an over-performance in
personal income tax and VAT revenue, as wage
growth surprised on the upside. However, non-tax
revenue was lower than targeted, in particular the
EU payments. Expenditure includes a one-off
payment under the guarantee contract with
the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (46). Some expenditure reallocations
from intermediate consumption and interest
expenditure to capital and social spending did not
affect the government balance.
In 2015, the government deficit is estimated at
1.1% of GDP, including the new measures adopted
in the 2015 budget. Revenue-increasing effort of
some 0.5% of GDP counts on improvements in tax
administration and closing of tax loopholes, tax
gains from the increase in the national minimum
wage, as well as higher royalty payments from

The guarantee was activated by the government contract in
late 2014 to sell out shares in Citadele bank. The deal will
be finalised in 2015.

state-own enterprises and some other charges on
businesses. The expenditure-increasing measures
of 0.6% of GDP include a public sector wage
increase to the new national minimum and
additional resources for health services, education,
defence and farmers. Main risks to the fiscal
forecast are related to uncertainty of the economic
growth outlook, while so far the effects of different
external shocks on tax revenue has been broadly
balanced.
The government deficit is projected to decline to
1.0% of GDP in 2016 based on a no-policy change
assumption. Latvia’s structural deficit is forecast to
deteriorate from around 1% of GDP in 2013 to
around 1½% in 2014 and 2015 and 1¾% in 2016,
mostly due to the widening of the positive output
gap.
The government debt stood at around 40% of GDP
in 2014 and is projected to decline to 36.5% of
GDP in 2015, as a large repayment of the EU
financial support was disbursed in January. An
increase in the primary surplus and positive GDP
growth should help the public debt-to-GDP ratio
fall further to about 35% of GDP in 2016.

Shrugging off the downturn in Russia

Lithuania’s economy is expected to maintain growth of 3.0% in 2015, despite a fall in exports to Russia.
Domestic demand is set to remain the main growth engine, as employment and real disposable incomes
rise. Inflation stays low and public finances improve slightly.
In 2014, domestic demand continued to be the
main driver of growth…

Real GDP growth remained robust in 2014 and is
expected to have reached 3.0%, despite the
sanctions imposed by Russia in mid-2014.
Domestic demand, in particular private
consumption, picked up in 2014 on the back of
growing employment and real wages. Private
investment grew strongly in the first half of 2014,
but seems to have petered out in the second half of
the year amid weaker economic sentiment.

…and is set to remain so in 2015 and 2016,
albeit with increased downside risks.

Lithuania’s real GDP is forecast to grow by 3.0%
in 2015 and 3.4% in 2016, despite continued
geopolitical uncertainty and the expected downturn
in Russia. Private consumption is set to remain
resilient over the forecast horizon. Wage growth
and subdued inflation are expected to continue to
support household disposable income. Private
investment is forecast to increase over the course
of 2015 as companies’ capacity utilisation rates are
at historically high levels. Moreover, EU cofinanced projects and the Investment Plan for
Europe are foreseen to provide further support to
public and private investment over the forecast
horizon.

90

Net exports are set to continue to exert a
dampening effect on real GDP growth. In 2014,
exports were already weak due to a fall in the
fertiliser and refined petroleum product industries,
as well as the sanctions imposed by Russia. In
2015, recession in Russia and the depreciation of
the rouble are likely to further constrain exports.
However, Lithuanian exporters are expected to redirect some of their goods and services, which
should allow exports to recover in 2016. The
current account is estimated to be broadly balanced
in 2014 and turn into surplus in 2015 due to the
fall in prices of imported oil.
The unemployment rate is forecast to continue
falling from 9.5% in 2014 to 8.7% in 2015 and
7.9% in 2016. This is expected to support
disposable income growth, while unit labour costs
are set to increase over the forecast horizon.
Inflation to remain low in 2015 and 2016

Average annual HICP inflation decreased in 2014
to 0.2% due to the decline in energy and food
prices. In 2015, inflation is expected to remain
low, with falling energy prices partially offsetting
price increases in the service sector. Overall, HICP
inflation is expected to amount to 0.4% in 2015
and 1.6% in 2016.
Credit growth remains sluggish

Private sector deposits continued to rise in 2014
but overall credit remained flat despite an increase
in mortgage lending and consumer credit. Most
enterprises relied on own resources to finance
investments, while banks still remain focused on
less risky projects. Credit is expected to start
growing towards the end of the forecast horizon, as
corporate investment rebounds.
Risks to the forecast are tilted to the downside. A
deepening of the Russian economic downturn,
lingering geopolitical tensions and slow economic
growth in the EU could have an adverse effect on

defence and social spending are expected to
increase by 0.3 pp. and 0.2 pp. of GDP
respectively.

Fiscal consolidation continues

In 2014, the general government deficit is forecast
to fall to 1.2% of GDP, from 2.6% in 2013. Tax
revenues as well as expenditures were broadly in
line with the government’s budget plan. Sizeable
one-off items influenced the deficit: the deposit
insurance fund contributed with a surplus of 1.3%
of GDP on account of liquidation proceeds. On the
other hand, a law on pension compensation was
enacted following a Constitutional Court ruling in
2012, adding 0.7% of GDP on the expenditure
side.

Under a no-policy-change assumption, the general
government deficit is expected to reach 0.9% of
GDP in 2016.
In 2014, Lithuania’s structural deficit is estimated
to decreased by ¼ pp. of GDP (from 2.2% of GDP
in 2013). It is set to fall further by ¼ pp. of GDP in
2015 and by ½ pp. of GDP in 2016.
General government debt is expected to increase
from 39.0% of GDP in 2013 to 41.8% in 2015, due
to the pre-financing of bond redemptions, and to
fall to 37.3% of GDP in 2016 as the pre-financing
ends.

In 2015, the general government deficit is forecast
at 1.4% of GDP. Tax revenues are set to improve
on the back of continued economic growth. On the
expenditure side, and in line with the 2015 budget,

16. LUXEMBOURG

A small budget deficit in 2015

Luxembourg’s economy is forecast to grow by 2.6% this year and its public finances are expected to
remain sound as the government takes action to counter rising challenges. Although job creation
remains robust, the relatively low unemployment rate is unlikely to fall further. Inflation remains
subdued in spite of the VAT rates increase.
Growth continues to remain robust

Real GDP grew at a quarterly rate of 2.3% in the
third quarter of 2014 after rising 1.0% and 0.5% in
the first two quarters of last year. Growth was
driven by strong domestic demand, which was also
boosted by investment. However, soft and hard
indicators signal that the pace of the recovery may
have slowed towards the end of the year. Overall,
real GDP in 2014 is estimated to have grown by
3.0%.

On the demand side, lower oil prices and positive
employment prospects should continue to support
household purchasing power. However, the impact
on private consumption of consolidation measures
in the 2015 budget, including a 2 pps. increase in
VAT rates, should act in the opposite direction,
lowering the growth rate of household spending.
As the economy picks up, private consumption is
projected to accelerate in 2016.
While capacity utilisation remains low, the
gradually improving external environment and the
Investment Plan for Europe, combined with easing
credit conditions, should support investment
growth in 2015 and even more so in 2016.
Specifically, public investment is expected to
surge by more than 10% this year, mainly due to
the implementation of sizeable projects, while
investment by households and the corporate sector
is set to stabilize.

Looking forward, the sluggish external economic
environment and the strains on the financial
sector's profitability imposed by the need to adjust
to the new regulatory financial standards are likely
to put some downward pressure to the
exceptionally high growth rates exhibited by the
country. Against this background, output growth is
expected to slow down to 2.6% in 2015, before
picking up again to 2.9% in 2016 when the
external
economic
environment
gradually
improves.
On the supply side, activity in the business-related
services sector is set to remain robust. The
financial sector’s contribution to growth, by
contrast, is expected to be less pronounced over
the next two years. The construction sector should
resume its recovery, albeit at a slow pace.

92

The contribution of net exports to growth is
expected to remain positive in 2015, backed by the
sustained performance of services, and despite the
acceleration of imports that accompany the sharp
rise in investment. As global economic conditions
gradually improve, external trade is projected to
gain further ground in 2016.
Challenges lie ahead

The main risk relates to the financial sector’s
capacity to protect its comparative advantage amid
significant shifts in the regulatory environment.
Moreover, international pressure for greater tax
harmonisation could potentially affect the
country’s economic prospects, at least in the short
term.
Inflation to remain low in spite of the VAT hike

Falling energy prices and the absence of price
pressures drove inflation down to 0.7% in 2014
from 1.7% in 2013. In 2015, the rise in VAT rates
will be absorbed by the sustained fall in oil prices.
Overall, HICP inflation is expected to set at 0.6%
in 2015 before bouncing back to 1.8% in 2016,

also pushed up by the Quantitative Easing
programme of the ECB.
As for labour market developments, in 2014,
Luxembourg’s domestic workforce increased at an
annual rate of 2.2%. After a strong first half, the
pace of job creation slowed slightly in the second
half of the year. Employment growth was subdued
in manufacturing, while it remained particularly
buoyant in the business-related services sector.
Overall, labour market prospects are projected to
remain positive with employment growth set to
average around 2% per year over the forecast
horizon, on the back of the solid economic
outlook. The unemployment rate is expected to
peak in 2015, and start decreasing in 2016.
Public finances weaken in 2015

In 2014, the general government surplus is set to
decline marginally to 0.5% of GDP from 0.6% in
2013, despite a one-off reimbursement of
contributions from EU own resources, worth 0.2%
of GDP, which helped improve the budget balance.

drop in VAT revenues (estimated at around 1.5%
of GDP) associated to the change in e-commerce
legislation. The size of the consolidation package
finally adopted in the budget has been reduced by
0.1% of GDP to around 1.0% of GDP compared to
the initial proposal. In particular, the new
education contribution has been replaced by the
‘impôt d’équilibrage budgetaire temporaire’
levied on a narrower base, while the
implementation of some saving measures has been
postponed. Finally, the afore-mentioned hike of all
VAT rates by 2 pps. is expected to produce
additional revenues of 0.5% of GDP. All in all, the
headline balance is projected to turn into a deficit
of 0.4% of GDP that also factors in a sharp
increase in public investment. In 2016, the
incremental effect and the implementation of
measures adopted with the ‘Zukunftpact’, worth
around 0.6% of GDP, should help rebalance the
government’s accounts.
The structural fiscal surplus is expected to narrow
by around 1 pp. in 2015 and marginally improve in
2016. The debt-to-GDP ratio is set to remain
below 30 % of GDP over the forecast horizon.

In 2015, the general government balance is
expected to deteriorate, mostly as a result of the

17. HUNGARY

Slower growth ahead

After growing by an estimated 3.3 % in 2014 Hungary’s economic growth is forecast to slow down in
2015 and further still in 2016. While the 2014 target for the headline deficit was likely overachieved, the
government deficit is projected to increase slightly in 2015.
The dynamic growth seen in 2014 is set to
decelerate

In the first three quarters of 2014, Hungary’s GDP
grew by 3.6% (y-o-y) bringing the annual rate to
an estimated 3.3%. This is attributed to growing
domestic demand, within which the contribution of
gross fixed capital formation was significant. The
surge in growth, however, was largely supported
by one-off factors, such as higher absorption of EU
funds and the central bank’s Funding for Growth
Scheme of subsidised loans to SMEs.
Signs that economic growth was beginning to slow
were already apparent in the second half of 2014.
The slowdown in growth is expected to continue
throughout the forecast horizon. Economic growth
is projected at 2.4% and 1.9% in 2015 and 2016,
respectively. This is partly due to the reverse
impact on investment of the above-mentioned oneoffs. Domestic demand will remain the main driver
of economic growth, but with a shift from
investment to private consumption as new
mortgage rules(47) are expected to boost household
real disposable income. With the start of the new
multi-annual financial period, the absorption of EU
funds might not decline in 2015, being an overlap
year between the two periods. Nevertheless, a
decrease in EU fund inflows seems unavoidable in
2016. This will be reflected in investment activity.
Export growth, which is forecast to decrease in
2015 due to lower demand from major trade
partners, is expected to pick up again in 2016,
while imports remain stable, fuelled by private
consumption. Hungary’s current account surplus is
set to remain stable at just over 4% of GDP in
2015, but it will rise slightly in 2016.
Unemployment falls further while inflation is
lower than expected

The number of unsubsidised job vacancies
increased in 2014, as did the activity rate and the

already fixed.

employment rate. With economic growth, job
creation in the private sector continued, but
employment growth was also supported by
extensive
public
works.
In
2014-Q3,
unemployment decreased to a low of 7.4% and it is
forecast to be slightly above 7.5% for the year as a
whole. At the end of the forecast horizon,
unemployment is set to fall below 7% because of
further increases in public works. At the same
time, wage dynamics in the private sector will
remain moderate because of lower inflation in
2015. In the public sector, nominal wage freezes
and the increase of public works, which create
mainly low-paid jobs, should keep wages subdued.
HICP inflation in 2014 was 0.0%. Consumer
prices in 2015 are projected to grow by 0.8%. The
downward revision (from 2.5% in the autumn
forecast) is mainly due to the fall in oil prices but
also due to historically low inflationary pressures
in the euro area. These effects are expected to
diminish from the second half of 2015. With the
output gap closing and the weaker exchange rate
passing through to prices, inflation is expected to
reach 2.8% in 2016.
Risks to the growth forecast are balanced

If private consumption dynamics is more in line
with the projected path of real disposable income
growth (i.e. lower precautionary savings), growth
could be higher. The possibility of normal lending
being restored faster than assumed represents
another positive risk, especially with the
Investment Plan for Europe. An escalation of
geopolitical tensions would result in higher risk
premia, which would weaken the private sector’s
balance sheet, causing higher inflation and lower
growth.
Moderate improvement in public finances

Preliminary data suggest that the government’s
deficit in 2014 could reach 2.6% of GDP, i.e.
0.3 pp. below the official target and the autumn
forecast. The improvement partly stems from the
cancellation of the extraordinary reserve (i.e. a
conditional expenditure item serving as a

Member States, Hungary

budgetary buffer). In addition, spending increases
linked mainly to the amendment of the budget in
November were more than offset by extra
revenues, including corporate income tax
windfalls.
Based on the adopted budget, the 2015 deficit is
projected at 2.7% of GDP. While expected interest
outlays decreased, the primary balance has
deteriorated slightly since the autumn forecast.
This reflects additional expenditure of more than
1% of GDP, which is largely compensated by
revenue-increasing measures, additional EU
funding, and the positive base effect of higherthan-expected tax receipts. The forecast does not
include the planned one-off revenues from asset
sales which are still unspecified, while it is
assumed that investments linked to these receipts
will be scaled down, but only partly.
Based on a no-policy-change assumption, the
government deficit is projected to decrease to 2.5%
of GDP in 2016. This is due to the phasing-out of
one-off transactions and the forecast moderate
expenditure growth. EU funds absorbed by the
government sector are expected to decline by 2%

of GDP, which results both in lower revenues and
expenditures (including the VAT content of EU
funded projects as well as the assumed savings due
to lower co-financing needs).
Regarding budgetary risks, the 2014 deficit
outcome remains subject to uncertainties relating
to the performance of local governments. In 2015
and beyond, positive risks are related to the
additional effects of recent measures to combat
VAT avoidance as well as to the realisation of
some asset sales. On the negative side, the
financial correction of EU funds may turn out
higher than planned and there is also a notable risk
of spending overruns in the education sector.
The structural balance is forecast to deteriorate
significantly in 2014 to -2.6% of GDP, and then to
stabilise before improving by less than ¼ pp. in
2016. The debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase
by 0.4 pp. in 2014 to 77.7% mainly on account of
the weakening of the exchange rate. In 2015, the
debt reduction is expected to be hampered by the
need to provide domestic advance payments for
the closing of EU co-financed projects. The debtto-GDP ratio is projected to decline faster in 2016.

Dynamic growth and low unemployment ahead

The economy has maintained a healthy momentum. GDP growth is estimated to have reached 3.3% in
2014, a rate which should moderate somewhat by 2016 but remain strong relative to the rest of the euro
area. HICP inflation is estimated to have bottomed out in 2014 and should gradually recover in 2016
while the favourable macroeconomic climate should help the budget deficit fall below 2% of GDP.
Real GDP growth rose in the third quarter of 2014
to reach 3.8% in annual terms, up from 3.4% in the
second quarter. This reflected strong domestic
demand, underpinned by dynamic investment in
the energy sector and favourable labour market
developments, and to a lesser extent exports,
which, albeit weak, continue to outpace imports.
Real GDP growth is estimated to have reached
3.3% in 2014 as a whole. Thereafter, it is expected
to remain stable in 2015 and moderate somewhat
by the end of the forecast horizon, reaching 2.9%
in 2016.

Stronger recovery in the demand for credit,
resulting from lower interest rates, could further
boost the investment outlook thus representing an
upside risk to the macroeconomic scenario. The
ongoing energy reforms could improve the
competitiveness of the corporate sector and lower
costs for companies, which could result in higherthan-expected investment and exports.

Robust growth outlook

Private consumption is expected to continue
showing strong growth in 2015-16, as disposable
incomes rise due to falling energy prices and
unemployment. Wage growth is seen to accelerate
towards the end of the forecast horizon, thereby
lending further support to aggregate household
spending. Private investment is set to receive
another large, albeit temporary, boost from the
construction of a new power plant over the course
of 2015. Energy-sector investment is also planned
for 2016 although on a smaller scale – the existing
power plant is planned to be converted to run on
gas. The high base from 2015, however, is
expected to result in noticeably weaker growth the
following year. Despite the projected pick-up in
import-intensive domestic demand, Malta’s current
account balance is projected to remain in surplus,
benefitting from a depreciation of the euro against
other major currencies, which is seen to boost
exports of the services sector and a moderate
recovery in the electronics sector.
Malta’s labour market is projected to continue to
perform well as the employment dynamics are
projected to continue to be driven by the
improvement in the labour market activity of
women. Job creation is forecast to moderate
somewhat compared to 2013-14 but to remain
robust at around 2% per annum, while
unemployment is seen to remain below 6%.

Consumer inflation to pick up gradually

HICP inflation averaged 0.8% in 2014, down from
1% in 2013, largely due to the lowering of
electricity tariffs in March. However, at 1.7%, core
inflation, remained close to its long-term average.
Both overall HICP and core inflation are projected
to rise in 2015-16, on the back of rising services
inflation as well as moderate increases in food and
energy prices in 2016.
Budget deficit moderates

In 2014, the budget deficit is expected to have
decreased to 2.3% of GDP, from 2.7% in 2013.
The share of current primary expenditure relative
to GDP is projected to have increased on the back
of higher intermediate consumption as well as
higher spending due to the temporary
nationalisation of the public transport system,
which led to a higher public sector wage bill and
subsidies (the service was privatised again in

Member States, Malta

2015). Employment in the public sector has also
increased due to new recruitments in the health and
education sectors. Net capital expenditure is set to
have dropped due to a lower capital injection into
Air Malta than the one in 2013. The favourable
macroeconomic outlook as well as the revenue
increasing measures included in the 2014 budget
are expected to have supported current revenue, to
an increase of 0.7 pp.
The government’s 2015 budget includes mostly
revenue-increasing measures, such as increases in
indirect taxation, fees and measures to fight tax
evasion. On the expenditure side, the budget
envisages several social measures (among which,
child and in-work benefits for low income
households and a compensation for those who do
not qualify for income tax cuts) which are only
partly compensated by some restraint on public
wages. As a whole, the current revenue ratio is
projected to increase by 0.9 pp. of GDP, also on
the back of higher-than-expected revenue from the
International Investor Programme. Capital
expenditure is set to increase due to a further

capital injection into Air Malta of almost 0.5% of
GDP. Overall, in 2015 the deficit is expected to
narrow to 2.0% of GDP and to further decrease to
1.8% of GDP in 2016, on a no-policy-change
assumption, also thanks to favourable nominal
GDP growth.
After having worsened by more than 1 pp. of GDP
in 2013, the structural deficit is estimated to have
remained stable in 2014. It is projected to improve
by ¼ pp. of GDP both in 2015 and 2016.
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio
increased to 69.5% in 2013, also on account of a
debt-increasing stock-flow adjustment related to
tax arrears from Enemalta (the public energy
utility corporation). Also thanks to the expected
repayment of these arrears, the debt ratio is
projected to decrease to 68.6% of GDP in 2014
and to reach 66.8% of GDP by 2016.
Downside risks are linked to higher-than-expected
subsidies to Malta’s new public transport service
provider.

19. THE NETHERLANDS

Domestic demand takes the lead

The Netherlands has so far a somewhat hesitant economic recovery, with GDP in the third quarter of
2014 growing just 0.1%. Growth in 2015 and 2016 is expected to strengthen gradually, with a growing
contribution of domestic demand. Dragged down by the recent fall in oil prices, annual HICP inflation
pressures will be muted over the forecast horizon. The general government deficit is estimated to have
reached 2.8% of GDP in 2014 and is expected to further decline to 2.2% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016.
A hesitant recovery in 2014

After a negative first quarter, the Dutch economy
started to grow again thanks to positive net exports
and a recovery of domestic demand. Annual
growth of GDP is expected to reach 0.7% in 2014.
Soft indicators as well as the most recent monthly
data suggest that the economic recovery of the
Netherlands will continue. Nevertheless, the
extremely mild weather conditions this winter
might have lowered the consumption of natural gas
by Dutch households, negatively affecting
consumption growth in the fourth quarter.
Domestic demand set to support the recovery
in 2015 and 2016

Domestic demand is expected to become the main
driver of growth over the forecast horizon, as wage
growth accelerates and inflation remains low. A
gradual recovery in house prices should also
provide a boost to economic sentiment. At the
same time, deleveraging pressures in the Dutch
economy will limit the potential for a faster
recovery of domestic consumption and are likely
to offset the impetus coming from lower oil prices.
Industrial production and investment are expected
to increase steadily, in line with the gradual
recovery of economic growth.
In 2015, net exports are expected to deliver about
one third of the total growth of real GDP, while
two thirds is forecast to come from domestic
demand. In 2016, economic growth is expected to
come almost solely from domestic demand, with a
limited contribution of the external sector.
Labour market improves

Over the course of 2014, labour market conditions
improved on both sides of the market. More
workers entered into the labour market while
employment
grew
simultaneously.
The
unemployment rate declined substantially in 2014.
After it peaked at 7.3% in February, the
unemployment rate declined substantially during

98

the year and stood at 6.7% in December 2014.
These dynamics are expected to continue but at a
slower pace. Employment is expected to grow
gradually; while the unemployment rate is foreseen
to decline to 6.6% in 2015 and 6.4% in 2016.

Low but positive inflation

Inflation pressures are expected to remain muted
because of the recent fall in oil prices, markedly
lower import prices, and the slow pace of domestic
demand growth. HICP inflation is forecast at 0.4%
in 2015, while prices are set to rise 0.7% in 2016.
In particular, energy price inflation is expected to
deliver a negative contribution to HICP inflation.
Positive pressure on HICP inflation is expected to
come from price developments in the services
sector due to a healthy wage growth.
Downside risks remain but lower oil prices may
fuel consumption

Risks to the outlook are large and mostly negative.
The largest risks are external, principally the
possibility that adverse global developments could
spill over to the very open economy of the
Netherlands. Domestically, the household debt
overhang may continue to weigh on growth more
heavily than assumed. Low energy prices do imply
an upside risk as well, as they may fuel world trade

Member States, The Netherlands

and disposable income more than the forecast
assumes.
Nominal deficit set to improve further

For 2014, the general government budget deficit is
estimated to have reached 2.8% of GDP. This
includes incidental factors such as the adjustment
of EU contributions following the GDP revision in
the context of ESA 2010. For 2015 and 2016, the
general government budget deficit is set to
improve to 2.2% and 1.8% of GDP, respectively,
on the back of government measures (most
importantly the reduction of the maximum accrual
rate of pensions and decentralisations in the long
term-care sector). For 2016, the forecast takes into
account the measures detailed in the multi-annual
budget
agreement
(‘Regeerakkoord’).
An
additional positive influence on the budget comes

from the recovery of domestic demand, which will
lead to more tax-rich economic growth.
The structural deficit is expected to hover around
¾% of GDP in both 2014 and 2015, but as the
output gap closes, it is foreseen to move further
away from the MTO above 1% of GDP in 2016.
The gross government debt ratio is forecast to
stabilise at 70.5% of GDP in 2015 and 2016.
Risks to the fiscal forecast largely mirror
macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition there are
uncertainties surrounding certain policy measures.
For example, the pension reforms which are
intended to broaden the tax base via lower tax
deductible pension premiums. The budgetary
impact (estimated at circa 1.5 billion euro or 0.2%
of GDP in 2015) will depend on actual
developments in pension premiums.

20. AUSTRIA

Lingering weakness and uncertainty hamper a stronger rebound

The likelihood of an imminent upswing seems to be fading as Austria’s growth in 2014 was likely flat
and business and consumer confidence have continued to deteriorate at the start of 2015. Continued
lukewarm investment may start posing a risk to the economy’s readiness to benefit from a recovery in
international trade. The economy’s anaemic growth is expected to weigh on public finances, although
this should be offset in part by planned consolidation measures.
Entering stagnation

The Austrian economy is expected to have
stagnated in 2014. The dynamics of economic
activity were weak or negative across all sectors,
particularly in the third quarter, when GDP growth
turned negative (-0.3%). Export growth weakened
further compared to the year before amid slumping
demand for imports from the euro area. The
growth contribution of foreign trade is likely to
have been negative. Domestic demand was
supported by a short-lived, tax-related investment
rally early in 2014, by public consumption and, to
a lesser extent, by consumer demand which was
slightly livelier thanks to the continuing growth of
employment.
Fragile outlook subject to uncertainty

No tangible acceleration of growth is expected in
the early quarters of 2015 and thus GDP growth
for the year as a whole is expected to be around
0.8%. Business and consumer sentiment indicators
for the turn of the year indicate another soft patch
extending over the next few months.
GDP growth in 2016 is forecast to strengthen to
1.5%, although this will depend on a pick-up in
international trade and a more vigorous response
from investment and consumption to supportive
factors such as the low interest rate environment.
The latest monetary policy measures are expected
to favour both these channels. Domestic demand is
expected to contribute to most of the increase in
GDP.
The low interest rate environment is supportive of
investment, but capacity utilisation rates and orderbook levels indicate some degree of slack. Low
interest rates should also benefit housing demand,
which, together with rising house prices in recent
years, are expected to revive construction activity
over the coming years.
The evolution of foreign demand over the forecast
horizon should present opportunities to Austrian

100

exporters, which have broadly maintained
productivity growth, and enable them to benefit
from their strong integration in international
production chains. However, the fact that
investment has been lukewarm over the last twothree may have left Austrian companies less well
placed to profit from such a recovery. The
improving outlook for exports is nevertheless
expected to help restart investment growth. With
both exports and imports picking up, net exports
are projected to contribute positively to growth in
2015-16, unlike in 2014.
Consumption supported by a stable labour
market

Employment growth is expected to have picked up
mildly to around 1% in 2014, despite sluggish
economic activity, driven by job creation in service
sectors. Although employers’ expectations suggest
job creation could slow, stronger GDP growth
should mean that job creation remains positive in
2015 and picks up in 2016. Unemployment may,
however, be slow to decline, as labour supply is
likely to keep increasing on account of
immigration. Positive employment growth, rather
than real wages, is seen as the main driver of real
household income growth and should support a
moderate increase in consumption growth over the
forecast horizon.
Core inflation positive and stable

Consumer price inflation turned out at 1.5% in
2014, reflecting a disinflationary impact from
energy prices. The momentum in the remaining
components, in particular hospitality and
recreation services, has continued due to unabated
demand in these sectors, keeping core inflation at
1.9%. These trends are expected to remain in place
over the forecast horizon, especially as demand
strengthens. Energy prices are expected to decline
further in 2015 but consequently regain some
ground in 2016. All in all, headline inflation is
projected at 1.1% for 2015 and 2.2% in 2016.

Member States, Austria

Public finances suffer from the weak economic
outlook

The general government deficit is expected to have
widened to 2.8% of GDP in 2014, mainly due to
the winding-down of Hypo Alpe Adria which the
government estimated to have cost around 1.2% of
GDP, although the required assessment of this
operation by an independent body has not yet been
carried out.
The one-off nature of the cost borne by the
government for Hypo's winding-down is the main
factor underlying the decline in the deficit to 1.9%
of GDP in 2015. Besides this positive effect, the
2015 deficit figure is negatively affected by
anaemic growth, which is expected to have nonnegligible impact on government tax revenue.
However, the consolidation measures announced
by the government after the submission of the
Draft Budgetary Plan to the Commission in
October, accounting for 0.2% of GDP, are
expected to limit the downward revision in the
2015 deficit estimate to 0.2% of GDP compared to
the Commission 2014 autumn Forecast. Shortfalls

in the full implementation of these additional
measures, in particular with regard to further
savings required from subnational governments,
represent a source of risk in this forecast. Other
downside risks arise from the persistent weak
cyclical conjuncture and which could lead to
larger-than-expected reduction in government tax
revenue. On the contrary, additional government
intervention in those banks under the process of
restructuring could either not occur in 2015 or their
cost could be lower than the current budget
allocation of roughly 0.3% of GDP, which would
lead to a lower deficit in 2015. The government
deficit is projected to fall to 1.4% of GDP in 2016
due to better economic conditions.
The structural balance is estimated at about -1% of
GDP in 2014 and is expected to remain stable over
the forecast horizon.
Austria's public debt, after rising by roughly 6 pps.
to 86.8% of GDP in 2014, due to the transfer of
Hypo Alpe Adria assets under public account, is
expected to decline to 86.4% of GDP in 2015 and
to 84.5% of GDP in 2016.

21. POLAND

Growth is proving resilient

Despite external headwinds, Poland’s real GDP growth was strong in 2014. Economic activity is set to
remain robust on the back of solid domestic demand, bolstered by improving labour market conditions
and rising real disposable incomes. The Russia-Ukraine crisis and weak demand in the euro area are
now forecast to weigh less than previously expected. Public finances are projected to improve.
Robust economic activity in 2014…

Poland’s real GDP is expected to have grown by
3.3% in 2014, mainly due to strong domestic
demand. Private consumption accelerated, as the
initial confidence impact of the Russia-Ukraine
crisis on households turned out to be less important
than expected. Private consumption also benefited
from rising employment and higher real wages.
Lower financing costs and the long-delayed
renewal and expansion of production capacities,
amid high capacity utilisation levels, has fuelled a
rebound in corporate investment.
…is projected to continue.

Exports and private investment are set to moderate
in the beginning of 2015 as the repercussions of
the Russia-Ukraine crisis become more tangible
and growth in the euro area remains modest.
However, the slowdown in exports and investment
is expected to be short-lived. The negative impact
from weak euro area growth and the RussiaUkraine crisis is expected to be counterbalanced
by the redirection of Polish exports towards more
dynamic markets and by gains in price
competitiveness. Private consumption is set to
grow as real wages and employment climb.
The ongoing recovery of credit growth supported
by declining financing costs is expected to further
encourage private investment. Profit margins in the
corporate sector are set to increase as prices of
imported intermediate goods fall faster than prices
of final goods. This increase should support
corporate investment spending and wage growth.
Public investment is set to gather steam in 2015
with the implementation of new projects cofinanced by the EU. Economic activity is expected
to accelerate somewhat in 2016, as external
demand picks up. Real GDP growth is projected to
ease to 3.2% in 2015 and then rebound to 3.4% in
2016.
The contribution of net exports to real GDP growth
is expected to remain negative over the forecast
horizon as domestic demand gains momentum. As

102

a result, the current-account deficit is forecast to
rise to 2% of GDP in 2016, up from 1.3% in 2014,
in spite of falling commodity prices and higher
terms-of-trade.
Poland’s labour market should benefit from the
solid pace of economic activity and growing
production capacities. The unemployment rate is
set to decline from 9.1% in 2014 to 8.3% in 2016.
A tighter labour market is expected to translate
into nominal wage growth and, in turn, higher
disposable incomes.

The risks to the forecast are balanced. On the
upside, a depreciation of the Polish złoty against
the currencies of main trading partners in the wake
of the Russia-Ukraine crisis would boost exports
and support import substitution. On the downside,
a new escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis could
weigh on economic activity through lower exports
and higher gas prices. By contrast, a possible
appreciation of the Polish currency in the wake of
the ECB QE might hamper exports.
Prices to fall

Very low external inflationary pressures coupled
with falling food and oil prices are forecast to keep
prices falling until the third quarter of 2015.
Consumer prices should start rising again
moderately thereafter, on the back of base effects
in food prices and robust domestic demand.

Member States, Poland

Inflation is expected to average -0.2% in 2015 and
to increase to 1.4% in 2016.
Public finances are set to gradually improve

The general government deficit is estimated to
have fallen to 3.6% of GDP in 2014, from 4% in
2013. The deficit in 2014 is projected to have
improved thanks to restraint on the expenditure
side, in particular due to a partial freeze of public
wages. These expenditure savings, however, are
expected to have been partially offset by increases
of some categories of social spending (including a
legislated extension of maternity leave) and oneoff costs linked to the resolution of some credit
unions.
The forecast for the deficit is projected to fall to
2.9% in 2015. Government revenues are set to
benefit from the pace of economic growth.
Moreover, social security contributions retained by
the general government are set to increase due to
the partial reversal of previous systemic pension
reform (limiting the role of the private pension
funds). On the expenditure side, the cost of the
planned restructuring of the mining sector and
some social spending measures (including higher

indexation of low-income pensions) will partially
offset expenditure savings in other areas, like the
continued partial freeze of public wages.
In 2016, the general government deficit is
projected to improve to 2.7%, on the back of the
projected acceleration of GDP. Moreover, the
projected deflation of consumer prices in 2015 will
have a constraining effect on social expenditure
(some of which is indexed to inflation from the
previous year). The restructuring of the mining
sector poses a downside risk to the public finances
forecast in 2015 and 2016.
The structural deficit is set to improve over the
forecast horizon, from 3.5% of GDP in 2013 to
2.4% in 2016. The general government debt-toGDP ratio is set to fall from 55.7% in 2013 to
48.6% in 2014 due to a large transfer of assets
accumulated in private pension funds. It is
expected to amount to 49.8% in 2016. The
projected debt figures are, however, subject to
considerable uncertainty because of the potential
impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the
relatively high share of Poland’s sovereign debt
denominated in foreign currencies.

22. PORTUGAL

Modest recovery to continue as external demand grows

The modest recovery of Portugal’s economy and public finances is set to continue, as financing
conditions and external demand gradually improve. Investment growth, however, is expected to remain
subdued.
Recovery gradually progresses

Portugal’s real GDP rose 0.3% q-o-q in the third
quarter of 2014, driven by an acceleration of
private consumption and investment, while imports
increased more strongly than exports. The latest
economic sentiment and confidence indicators
have stabilised suggesting that the recovery in
domestic demand should continue, with the help of
lower commodity prices while the weak external
environment continues to exert a drag on export
growth.
Private consumption has benefitted from a cyclical
rebound of household spending but is projected to
lose momentum over the forecast period due to the
still high deleveraging pressures of the household
sector. However, the expected improvement of the
labour market, growing disposable income and low
inflationary pressure should keep private
consumption at a robust pace with growth rates of
about 1.8% in 2015 and 1.5% 2016.

quarters of 2014 was up by 2% compared to the
same
period
in
2013.
Consequently,
unemployment in Portugal fell below 14% in
2014-Q3. With specific factors, such as the
reinforcement of active labour market policies,
becoming less important, employment growth is
expected to become more aligned with economic
growth. The unemployment rate is expected to
decline from 14.2% in 2014 to 12.6% in 2016.

Private investment increased significantly in the
second and third quarter of 2014 (3.5% y-o-y on
average), mainly in machinery and equipment. In
2014, a comprehensive reform of the corporate
income taxation entered into force, which
positively affected the investment climate.
Nonetheless, credit to non-financial corporations
remains subdued and corporate debt is being
reduced confirming the ongoing deleveraging
process in the sector. Overall, investment growth is
projected to strengthen only marginally from 2.4%
in 2014 to 3.1% in 2016. Exports are expected to
accelerate over the forecast period, in line with
external demand, while stronger domestic demand
is set to lift imports. As a result, net exports will
likely detract from growth in 2014 but make a
small positive contribution in 2015 and 2016. GDP
growth is expected to rise from 1.0% in 2014 to
1.6% in 2015 and 1.7 % in 2016.

Low inflationary pressure

HICP inflation fell to -0.2% in 2014, mainly due to
the sharp decrease in energy prices, but it is
expected to reach positive territory in the second
half of 2015 mainly on the back of accelerating
wages. However, inflation is projected to remain
low because unemployment is still high, the
negative output gap is sizeable and oil prices are
falling. HICP is forecast to accelerate to 0.1% in
2015 and to 1.1% in 2016.
More balanced risks to the economic outlook

Risks to the macroeconomic outlook have become
more balanced since the autumn 2014 forecast.
Nevertheless, there remains some downside risk to
the growth forecast related to external demand and
still high private sector indebtedness level which
might impede solid growth performance.

Member States, Portugal

personal income tax and green taxation reforms.
As before, the projections take on board some
improvement in the efficiency of revenue
collection from the fight against tax fraud and
evasion, while factoring in uncertainty about the
additional yields from these measures. Under the
no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is
forecast to fall to 2.8% of GDP in 2016. Risks to
the projections are slightly negative and mainly
relate to macroeconomic developments, the
continuation of efficiency gains in revenue
collection, the implementation of the envisaged tax
reforms in a budget-neutral fashion, and possible
spending slippages.

Public finances benefitting from the modest
recovery

The general government deficit is expected to have
reached 4.6% of GDP in 2014, with cash budget
execution characterised by solid tax collection and
effective expenditure restraints, which more than
offset underperformance of other revenue. Risks to
the headline deficit projection relate to the cashaccrual final adjustments as well as to the one-off
operation related to Novo Banco, which could end
up being deficit-increasing, depending on the time
and value of the potential sale of the bank.
The headline deficit is expected to decline further
to 3.2% of GDP in 2015. The slight improvement
of the fiscal outlook for 2015, compared to the
autumn forecast, is the net result of the carry-over
from the better-than-expected 2014 performance
and the negative impact from lower yields of some
policy measures as well as the revised
macroeconomic outlook. In particular, the lower
nominal GDP somewhat deteriorates the deficit-toGDP ratio. This forecast is underpinned by the
consolidation package included in the budget for
2015 (assessed to be worth 0.5% of GDP and thus
too small to compensate pressures for increased
expenditure) and other measures, such as the

The structural deficit is forecast to rise in 2015, as
the headline deficit reduction is based on cyclical
factors rather than on structural measures. The
structural balance is estimated to deteriorate by
½% of GDP in 2015.
The gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to
have reached almost 129% by end-2014, driven by
higher deposits and the euro depreciation, and is
expected to fall to 124.5% by end-2015, supported
by the projected economic recovery, the primary
budget surplus and debt-reducing operations.

23. ROMANIA

Sustained growth ahead

Romania’s economic growth is forecast to remain robust in 2015 and 2016, mainly driven by domestic
demand and accompanied by a stable labour market. After a sharp decline in 2014, inflation is expected
to remain moderate over the forecast horizon. Fiscal consolidation is due to continue in 2015.
Continued economic growth powered by
domestic demand

Romania’s economy registered surprisingly strong
growth in 2014-Q3 (1.8 % q-o-q) thanks to betterthan-expected private consumption and exports,
and a significant contribution from inventories.
Investment continued to contribute negatively
although its contraction eased significantly.
Confidence indicators are back to pre-crisis levels,
pointing to continued momentum for the economy.
As a result, annual growth is estimated to have
reached 3.0% in 2014.

lower social security contributions and a lower
special construction tax) and improving financing
conditions are likely to boost private investment.
Moreover, public investment is expected to
accelerate driven by a pick-up of projects
co-financed with EU funds. Given the strength of
exports, the growth contribution of net exports
continued to be positive in 2014. Exports are
forecast to continue increasing in 2015 and 2016
thanks to the expected recovery of Romania’s
main trading partners, but the pace of growth will
be somewhat slower. Imports, however, are
expected to rise at a faster rate, propelled by the
strengthening of domestic demand. The growth
contribution of net exports is expected to turn
slightly negative in 2016.

Risks to the macroeconomic and inflation outlook
appear broadly balanced. Downside risks include
faster-than-expected deleveraging and the impact
of a further deterioration in geo-political tensions
from the Ukraine-Russia conflict hurting market
confidence and the economic outlook in major
trading partners. Upside risks are related to
stronger-than-expected effects from the EU
Investment Plan and actual implementation of
more structural reforms.
Lower unemployment and moderate inflation

Economic growth in Romania is forecast to stay
above potential, at 2.7% in 2015 and 2.9% in 2016,
powered by domestic demand and also supported
by the gradual recovery expected in the global
economy. Private consumption is expected to
remain robust, as growing wages, low inflation,
falling interest rates and improving labour market
conditions are all supportive for the purchasing
power of households. As already observed in 2014,
local currency lending is projected to continue
growing given easing credit conditions and an
expected slowdown in the deleveraging process.
After two years of contraction, both private and
public investments are forecast to start recovering.

Romania’s labour market has been remarkably
stable over the last few years, with employment
and unemployment rates hovering around constant
levels. Domestic employment in the private sector
is expected to improve slightly against a slowly
declining working-age population, accompanied
by a drop in the unemployment rate over the
forecast horizon, to 6.8% in 2016. Further stepwise
increases in the gross minimum wage in 2015 and
the 5% cut of the employers’ social security
contribution will have opposing effects on labour
costs. Compensation per head is projected to grow
by more than 3% in 2015 and by some 4% in 2016,
entailing further real wage increases in an
environment of moderate inflation.
After reaching an historical low of 0.9% in June
2014, HICP inflation slightly picked up in recent

Member States, Romania

months. Annual average inflation declined from
3.2% in 2013 to 1.4% in 2014 mainly reflecting a
VAT cut for bread, a good harvest and lower
global energy prices. It is forecast to remain at
moderate levels and to reach an annual average of
1.2% in 2015, mainly due to the significant decline
in energy prices, subdued inflation in the EU and
lower inflation expectations. In 2016, inflation is
forecast to accelerate to 2.5% as the recovery in
domestic demand continues.
Fiscal consolidation to continue in 2015

In 2014, the budget deficit is estimated to have
decreased to 1.8% of GDP, from 2.2% in 2013. An
increase in excise duties on fuels and the
introduction of a special construction tax
outbalanced the impact of lower social security
contributions following a rate cut of 5 pps., which
took effect on 1 October 2014, and the tax
exemption on reinvested profits. Tax collection
improved in late 2014 following subdued
performance earlier in the year. Capital
expenditure decreased significantly from 2013.
The government budget deficit is forecast to
decrease further to 1.5% of GDP in 2015, as a
reduction in tax revenues is outweighed by

reductions in expenditure, expressed as a fraction
of GDP. The revenue side includes the full-year
impact of the cut in social security contribution
and the reduction in the special construction tax
rate. Expenditure in goods and services is forecast
to fall significantly. The public wage bill remains
contained, since only some categories benefit from
either pay rises or the increases in the minimum
wage and social security contributions will be
lower. Additional savings stem from the
discontinuation of non-recurrent spending in 2014,
such as the organisation of elections, and a
reduction in subsidies. This forecast assumes full
use of the budget allocation for national EU funds
co-financing. The past volatility of tax collection
and tight budget allocations for social assistance
and interest expenditure could emerge as pressure
point for the deficit. EU funds absorption might
surprise on the downside.
In 2016, the headline deficit is expected to remain
at 1.5% of GDP under the customary no-policychange assumption with revenues developing in
line with better growth prospects. In structural
terms, the deficit is forecast to improve from 1½%
of GDP in 2013 to around 1¼% of GDP in
2014-16. Government debt is forecast at 38.7% in
2014 and should plateau in 2015-16 below 40%.

24. SLOVENIA

Growth continues, driven by exports and EU funded investment

Slovenia's economy grew by an estimated 2.6% in 2014, driven by net exports and exceptional levels of
infrastructure investment. Growth is forecast to moderate in 2015 to 1.8% before rebounding in 2016 to
2.3%. Bank recapitalisations continued to weigh on the general government budget in 2014 but as the
restructuring of the banking sector progresses, these costs are expected to cease. Public debt is expected
to peak in 2015 before commencing on a downward path.
Rebound in 2014 dominated by exports and
EU-funded investment

Having exited recession in 2013, Slovenia's
economy grew by 2.6% y-o-y in the first three
quarters of 2014. Growth has become more broadbased, although net exports remain the main
engine. Slovenia continued to increase its exports
despite lower growth in some key trading partners,
demonstrating growing market shares. Investment
was another important contributor to growth in
2014, mainly driven by infrastructure projects cofunded by the EU. However, equipment
investment contracted partly due to a high base
effect. Household consumption grew for the first
time since 2010 and is projected to grow gradually
over the forecast horizon.
Temporary deceleration of growth expected
due to a change in growth drivers

Real GDP is estimated to have grown by a robust
2.6% in 2014. Growth is expected to slow down to
1.8% in 2015, partly due to a deceleration in
investments co-funded by EU, which was
exceptionally high in 2014. This is expected to be
partially compensated by the recovery of private
sector investment, as portended by high capacity
utilisation level and rising profitability. In 2016,
exports and private consumption, together with the
first increase in government consumption since
2010 (under a no-policy-change assumption) are
expected to lift GDP growth to 2.3%.
Corporates are expected to continue deleveraging,
although at a much slower pace than in previous
years. Net exports growth is expected to fall over
the forecast period, as the recovery in domestic
demand gathers pace. As a result, after having
increased further in 2014, Slovenia’s currentaccount surplus is projected to decrease
marginally, although it is expected to remain high.
The main downside risk to the economic growth in
2015 is lower growth in public investment
expenditure than currently planned.

Decreasing unemployment and low inflation

Unemployment peaked at 10.3% in February 2014
but decreased to 9.6% in November 2014. It is
expected to decline further over the forecast
horizon. Private sector wages are expected to
continue rising moderately and the continued
containment of public sector wages in 2015 should
restrain overall wage dynamics. As a consequence,
unit labour costs would rise only marginally.
Inflation is expected to remain at historically low
levels over the forecast horizon. Core inflation was
0.9% in 2014 and is expected to decrease
marginally to 0.7% in 2015. In 2016, the recovery
in domestic demand should feed price growth.
Driven by the recent sharp fall in oil prices and
similar trends on food and commodity markets,
HICP inflation is forecast to be negative in 2015
(-0.3%) although it should increase to 0.9% in
2016, mainly on the back of the expected recovery
of domestic demand and the assumption of slowly
rising oil prices.
Fiscal deficit expected to decline

In 2014, the general government deficit is forecast
to stand at 5.4% of GDP (down from 14.6% of
GDP in 2013), one percentage point higher than
the forecast last autumn. This is due to the

Member States, Slovenia

government's approval in December 2014 of a
scheme to repay deposit holders of Ljubljanska
Banka. Excluding one-offs, the deficit is estimated
to have fallen by 0.4 pp. of GDP between 2013 and
2014. An increase in gross fixed capital formation,
mainly via EU funded projects and higher interest
expenditure was offset by a reduction in
government consumption expenditure and an
increase in tax revenues.
For 2015, the general government deficit is
forecast to stand at 2.9% of GDP. The adjustment
in 2015 is targeted mainly through expenditure
savings, namely subsidy reforms and the
prolongation of measures to reduce the public
sector pay bill. The pay bill savings negotiated
with trade unions are lower than what was
anticipated in the Draft Budgetary Plan but this
slippage is expected to be offset by reductions in
intermediate consumption.
The potential risk of additional bank related oneoff costs affecting the 2015 deficit appear to have

been mitigated; in December 2014, the parliament
passed legislation establishing a bank resolution
fund. The fund will be financed by the banks and
will cover the costs of future bank resolutions.
In 2016, under a no-policy-change assumption the
general government deficit is expected to decline
further to 2.8% of GDP. A significant increase in
consumption expenditure is expected to be more
than offset by a reduction in gross fixed capital
formation due to the end of the drawdown period
from 2007-2013 EU programmes.
In structural terms, the fiscal position is forecast to
deteriorate by about ½ pp. in 2014 before
improving by ⅓ pp. in 2015. In 2016, the structural
balance is expected to deteriorate by some ½ pp.
due to a reduction in the output gap. General
government debt is projected to peak in 2015 at
83% of GDP before declining to around 82% in
2016 due to an expected reduction in precautionary
cash balances and a modest primary surplus.

25. SLOVAKIA

Domestic demand continues to power the recovery

Despite a slowdown in exports, Slovakia’s economy grew faster in 2014 because of a recovery in
domestic demand, which is expected to remain the motor of growth in 2015 and 2016. Unemployment
should gradually decrease in line with the improvement in economic activity. Inflation dropped sharply
in 2014 and is projected to recover only slowly. The government’s fiscal position is also expected to
improve.
Growth continues...

After having slowed down in 2013, growth in
Slovakia picked-up in 2014 with real GDP
expected to have increased by 2.4%. Growth is
expected to be at 2.5% in 2015 and to increase to
3.2% in 2016, driven by the continuing recovery of
domestic demand. The labour market also showed
signs of improvement in 2014 and is projected to
further strengthen. Inflation, which declined
sharply in 2014, is expected to rise only gradually.
Graph II.25.1: Slovakia - Real GDP growth and contributions

planned expansion of production facilities in the
automotive industry is expected to support
investment in 2015 and 2016. Overall, gross fixed
capital formation is estimated to have risen by
3.9% in 2014 and is expected to increase by 4.0%
in 2015 and 4.5% in 2016.
Exports dropped sharply in the second and third
quarters of 2014, mainly due to weak demand from
Slovakia’s main trading partners. Export growth is
projected to have slowed down to 4.4% in 2014
and is expected to decline further in 2015, before
rebounding the year after.

pps.

Imports are likely to have grown faster than
exports in 2014 due to the recovery in domestic
consumption and investment, which would mean
that net exports were a drag on GDP growth in
2014. From 2015, however, imports are forecast to
evolve more in line with exports and Slovakia is
expected to continue running a current account
surplus over the forecast horizon.

...driven by domestic demand.

Following three consecutive years of decline,
private consumption is projected to have increased
by 2.1% in 2014, supported by growing disposable
income, low inflation, improving labour market
conditions, and an increase in consumer
confidence. Going forward, private consumption
will also be bolstered by a series of labour market
reforms that take effect in 2015, including a rise in
the minimum wage and a reduction in the social
contributions paid by low-income workers. Private
consumption is therefore expected to accelerate to
2.2% in 2015 and 2.7% in 2016.
After continuing to decline in 2013, gross fixed
capital formation rebounded in 2014, driven by a
strong increase in equipment investment. A

Labour market conditions improve

Employment grew throughout 2014 in line with
the recovery in economic activity. In 2015, a series
of measures supporting the labour market will take
effect, including a reduction in the healthcare
contributions of low-income workers and an
expansion of in-work benefits. These should
further support the labour market recovery.
Consequently, Slovakia’s unemployment rate is
projected to have reached 13.4% in 2014 and is
forecast to fall to 12.8% in 2015 and 12.1% in
2016.
Inflation set to increase slowly

Declining energy and unprocessed food prices led
to a sharp drop in inflation in 2014. HICP inflation
was -0.1 % in 2014 and is projected to slowly
increase to 0.4 % in 2015 and 1.3 % in 2016,
driven by a pick-up in the prices of services
mirroring the recovery in domestic demand.

Member States, Slovakia

policies and education will, however, limit the
speed of the fiscal adjustment. Given recurrent
under-budgeting of the public wage bill in the past,
it is projected to be higher than budgeted. The
budget adopted by the Parliament does not reflect
the fact that local governments will not be obliged
to freeze their spending due to the second stage of
the debt brake as originally expected. The
Commission therefore assumes that spending of
local governments will be higher compared to the
budget. The envisaged savings in the healthcare
sector are also not taken to the full extent given the
absence of detailed measures to ensure their
achievement. General elections in 2016 represent a
risk to the forecast as they may create incentives
for additional spending. Assuming no change in
policy, the deficit should decline to 2.6% in 2016
on the back of favourable economic developments.

Deficit expected to stay under control

The general government deficit in 2014 is
estimated to have deteriorated to 3% of GDP
compared to 2.6% in the previous year, despite
positive developments in the state budget. The
cash deficit of the state budget was lower than
planned as tax revenues exceeded expectations,
expenditure freezes were activated by the national
debt brake, and because of lower co-financing
requirements for EU Structural and Cohesion
Funds. On the other hand, dividend shortfalls,
higher spending by local governments and on
healthcare together with the postponed loan
repayment by the freight train company Cargo,
pushed up the general government deficit. There is
also uncertainty about the statistical treatment of
dividends paid by the national gas company SPP,
which could have a negative impact on the final
fiscal figures for 2014.

The structural balance is projected to improve by
around ½ pp. to -2.0% of GDP in 2015 and decline
moderately in 2016. Slovakia’s public debt-toGDP ratio is expected to have reached 53.6% of
GDP in 2014 given large reductions in cash
reserves. In 2015, the debt is projected to reach
54.9% of GDP and increase slightly further by the
end of the forecast horizon.

For 2015, the deficit is projected to decrease to
2.8% of GDP. Consolidation measures on the
revenue side aim to broaden the tax base for
corporate income tax and further improving VAT
tax compliance. Support of R&D investment,
lowering the tax wedge for low-income workers,

Very gradual recovery after prolonged contraction

Although Finland's economy is likely to show no growth in 2014, the year ended on a somewhat more
positive note than it began. Lower oil prices and the weaker euro are expected to improve Finland's
growth prospects. Public finances remain in deficit, but should gradually improve.
Slow recovery continues in 2015

Overall, economic activity in Finland is expected
to turnout flat in 2014. But while the country was
still in recession in early 2014, economic growth
gained momentum as the months went by, driven
by net exports. The recovery is set to continue in
2015 and 2016. Although exports are forecast to
increase further, domestic demand is expected to
become the main driver of economic growth, as
increasing private consumption and investment
trigger additional imports.

Due to consolidation efforts, public consumption
and investment are not expected to contribute
significantly to growth in 2015-16. In real terms,
public consumption is expected to stay at last
year's level and public investment growth would
be very low in 2015 and recover somewhat in
2016.

On the supply side, the fall in manufacturing
production is bottoming out and manufacturing
companies saw their order books increase
throughout 2014. This is expected to support an
increase in manufacturing output in 2015 that, in
turn, should encourage a rise in volume of
services. Little is to be expected from construction,
however, as housing market activity has fallen
below historical average and applications for new
building permits were at historically low levels at
the end of 2014.
Consumer confidence is low, but rising

The economic situation of households looks
somewhat better than previously thought. The
labour market is set to improve gradually, starting
with a recovery in hours worked and followed by
an increase in headcount employment. However,
also the unemployment rate is expected to increase
slightly in 2015 to 9.0% as a growing number of
people (re)enter the labour market and start to
actively look for a job as prospects to find one
improve. Only in 2016 would the unemployment
rate decrease to 8.8%.
Very slow growth of households' real disposable
income and increased uncertainty about the
economic outlook weighed on private consumption
in 2014. The recent fall in oil prices has started to
feed into consumer prices, which is expected to
support real disposable incomes and, in turn,
accelerate the growth of private consumption. In
2016, growth of private consumption should
mainly be driven by higher employment.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Total domestic demand is expected to have fallen
by 0.8% in 2014 as investments declined further.
Capacity utilisation still at low levels is expected
to constrain investments in new machinery and
equipment in 2015. Investment in construction is
not expected to increase significantly before 2016.
Net exports to increase in 2015

In 2015, net exports are expected to support
economic growth, but not as much as in 2014.
Exports are set to increase in line with foreign
demand, while especially sluggish investment
keeps a lid on the growth of imports. The positive
impact of the depreciation of the euro against the
dollar on exports is, however, dampened by the
appreciation of the euro against the rouble and the
Swedish krona. Over the forecast period, Finland's
cost-competitiveness is forecast to improve thanks
to wage moderation and positive productivity
growth.
The recent fall in oil price is set to improve the
terms of trade significantly in 2015. As a result,

Member States, Finland

the trade balance of goods and services is expected
to turn positive in 2015 and increase further in
2016 despite the deficit in the trade balance of
services. The current account deficit is expected to
shrink over the forecast period.
Overall, risks to the forecast are assessed to be
balanced. The main risks stem from the external
outlook. Lower commodity prices and the
depreciation of the euro, also as the result of a
launch of ECB's expanded asset purchase
programme, could increase growth in Finland by
more than expected. Yet, a re-emergence of
uncertainty, especially in the euro area, would
entail downside risks.
Slow improvement in public finances

The general government deficit in 2014
expected to be 2.7% of GDP. In 2015, growth

increase as a result of tax measures. The central
government wage income tax brackets will again
be adjusted for wage inflation after a temporary
freeze, but only for the three lower income
categories. Low-income households will also
benefit from an increase in the deductible amounts
while mortgage-interest tax deductibility will be
further reduced, the progressivity of income
taxation will increase, some tax subsidies will be
eliminated, and excise duties and real-estate taxes
will increase.
The consolidation effort is expected to lead to a
0.2 percentage point reduction in the government
deficit in 2015. In 2016, assuming no policy
change, the deficit will further decline to -2.2% of
GDP.
The structural balance is expected to stay at close
to -1.0% of GDP in 2015 and to worsen by ¼ pp.
of GDP in 2016. Gross government debt is set to
reach 61.2% in 2015 and 62.6% in 2016.

Improving growth carried by domestic demand

Economic growth is expected to improve in the coming years on the back of healthy domestic demand
and a slowly improving global outlook. Employment growth remains strong, but unemployment is
unlikely to fall much because the labour force is growing. Inflation has remained subdued for several
years now, raising the prospect of a prolonged period of very low inflation.
a strong pace due to higher spending on integration
of migrants, education and elderly care.

Lopsided growth

While domestic demand is growing at a healthy
pace thanks to consumption and construction,
Sweden’s
export
sector
is
struggling.
Consequently, export-oriented industrial sectors
remain weak while service sectors are growing at a
strong pace. As external demand gradually
improves, investment and stronger exports will
help Sweden’s GDP growth to rise from an
estimated 1.8% in 2014 to 2.3% in 2015 and 2.6%
in 2016.

Consumption remains robust and employment
strong

Expansionary fiscal policy and low interest rates
have stoked strong domestic demand in recent
years. Although fiscal policy is expected to
become neutral or slightly contractionary,
household consumption growth will still find
support from low interest rates, growing
disposable incomes and steady employment
growth over the forecast horizon. Nevertheless,
weaker sentiment indicators and policies aimed at
dampening household indebtedness will affect
households’ consumption growth dynamics.
Household saving is projected to have reached a
new peak in 2014, and will only gradually decline
in the coming years as economic uncertainties are
waning and unemployment is starting to decrease.
Government consumption is projected to expand at

114

Despite a relatively modest economic activity,
employment growth was particularly strong in
2014, paving the way for a gradual decline of
unemployment in spite of a growing labour force.
Unemployment is forecast to fall from 7.8% in
2014 to 7.7% in 2015 and then to 7.5% in 2016.
The ongoing challenge for the Swedish labour
market is to integrate the growing number of
economically vulnerable groups (low-skilled,
young people and workers with a migrant
background).
Strong construction investment

Following a contraction of 0.4% in 2013,
investment is likely to rise by 4.7% in 2014. The
acceleration is driven by investment in housing,
while equipment investment remains subdued.
After historically low levels in 2013, housing
investment has rebounded sharply in 2014 by
nearly 20%. While housing investment will
continue growing at a slower pace, other
investments will catch up when external demand
increase.
Exports to remain subdued

Investment goods make up a significant proportion
of Sweden’s exports. As investment growth has
been weak in several of Sweden’s main trading
partners, Swedish exports have grown little,
despite the weakening of the Swedish krona
against the euro. While exports grew merely by
2.4% in 2014, imports rose by 5.1% in 2014.
Exports are likely to pick up somewhat over the
forecast horizon, but less than in previous
recoveries and not enough to provide an additional
boost to Sweden’s economic growth.
Risks are now more balanced

On the external side, lower oil prices could provide
a stronger boost, while increased geopolitical
uncertainties, such as further escalation of the

Member States, Sweden

Russia-Ukraine crisis, could have a more negative
impact on growth than currently foreseen.
Domestically, an abrupt correction of house prices,
which reached new historical heights in 2014,
could dampen household consumption.
Very low inflation persisting

Inflation in Sweden has been around 0% since the
end of 2012 because of low price increases for
energy and services and because import prices
have been weak as a result of subdued
international economic activity. In October 2014,
the Riksbank cut its repo rate from 0.25% to
0.00%, following a half percentage point cut in
July 2014. In spite of growing consumption and
employment, a negative output gap and a high
unemployment rate suggest ample spare capacity
in the economy, which would suppress price
increases. Falling oil prices are also pushing
inflation down. Rising wages and improved
economic performance are projected to moderately
lift HICP inflation from 0.2% in 2014 to 0.5% in
2015 and then to 1.0% in 2016. Policy discussions
are taking place in Sweden on the possible use and

impact of non-conventional monetary measures to
fight deflationary pressures.
Improving public finances

In December 2014, the opposition parties’ budget
was approved by the Parliament, causing a
political crisis in the country. The budget can be
amended in spring 2015, but any changes to
taxation would be unlikely to take effect before
2016. However, since both the opposition and the
government budgets contain only fully-funded
measures in line with the ‘krona for krona’
principle, this will not have a significant impact on
the government deficit. Net borrowing in 2014 will
be slightly lower mainly due to stronger VAT
revenues on the back of strong domestic demand.
After the nadir in 2014, public finances are
expected to improve, and the deficit to reduce to
1.6% in 2015 and 1.0% in 2016 on a no-policy
change basis. Negative risks to the budget could
come from a potentially worse macroeconomic
outlook and higher costs for integrating the large
inflow of migrants. The structural deficit, after
reaching 1.3% in 2014, is projected to improve to
1.0% in 2015 and 0.9% in 2016. The debt to GDP
ratio will remain around 41%.

Healthy growth expected whilst inflation set to fall further

The economy is expected to continue to grow at a solid pace driven by strong domestic demand.
However, net exports are projected to detract from growth. Unemployment should continue to fall as
labour market conditions are forecast to remain robust. Inflation is expected to decline in 2015 but
should pick up gently in 2016.
Revisions lower growth in 2014

Significant downward revisions to GDP for the
first three quarters of 2014 since the autumn
Forecast have affected GDP growth rates. In
particular, growth rates were revised downward by
0.1-0.2 pp. in each of the first three quarters of
2014. Growth is expected to have been less brisk
than forecast in autumn 2014 and is now projected
at 2.6% – a pick-up from 1.7% in 2013. Activity in
2014 is likely to have been driven solely by
domestic demand – reflecting healthy growth in
private consumption and gross fixed capital
formation – with the external sector expected to
have detracted from activity.

Momentum expected to continue

Although recent indicators, such as industrial
production and forward indicators from the major
business surveys, suggest a softening in activity in
the near-term, growth is projected to remain at
2.6% in 2015, buoyed by the impact of reductions
in world oil prices, before tempering slightly to
2.4% in 2016.
Buoyant private consumption

Growth in private consumption in 2015 and 2016,
of around 2.7% and 2.3% respectively, is expected
to provide substantial support to growth. Growth in
compensation of employees is forecast to outstrip

116

consumer price inflation, boosting household
disposable income. The decline in oil prices
reinforces the positive outlook. Consumer
sentiment remains supportive. The household
saving ratio is expected to continue to rise.
Solid growth in investment to continue

Gross fixed capital formation is projected to have
risen by 7.4% in 2014, more than double the rate in
2013. Although it is expected to moderate in 2015
and 2016, investment growth is expected to be
over twice the growth rate of GDP. The rise in
GDP growth in 2014, and the projected pattern of
solid growth there-after, should provide business
with the confidence to continue to invest. A low
cost of borrowing and strong corporate balance
sheets should also underpin investment. In
particular, a more resilient banking sector, as
confirmed by the results of the Bank of England's
'stress tests' of the eight largest domestic banks,
published in December 2014, should be in a
stronger position to provide more credit to firms.
Net exports continue to detract from growth

Net exports are expected to have reduced growth
by 0.6 pp. in 2014. Both exports and imports have
been unexpectedly subdued in 2014, as import
growth has not risen in line with increased
domestic demand and export growth has been
weak, possibly reflecting adverse conditions in
major export markets. Export and import growth
are expected to accelerate modestly in 2015 and
2016, while the detraction from growth from net
exports is expected to fade somewhat.
Robust labour market performance

The strong performance of the labour market in
recent years is expected to continue in 2015 and
2016. Employment growth is forecast at 1.4% in
2015 but to moderate in 2016, while the
unemployment rate is expected to fall further from
6.3% in 2014 to 5.4% in 2016. Compensation of
employees and productivity are projected to rise
and growth in unit labour costs is projected to

Member States, The United Kingdom

remain subdued. A downside risk to the forecast is
that productivity does not rise as expected.
Inflation to fall further

Inflation in 2014 was 1.5% and is expected to fall
in 2015 to 1.0% before rising to 1.6% in 2016. The
slackening in inflation in 2015 reflects the direct
and indirect effects of the fall in energy prices. The
appreciation of sterling, pressure on retailers'
margins, as a result of competitive pressures in the
supermarket sector, and modest wage inflation
underpin the outlook for low inflation.
Fiscal policy unchanged

The government's Autumn Statement, delivered at
the end of 2014, did not alter the general trend of
the fiscal consolidation plans over the forecast
horizon. The main new taxation measures
announced include a further increase in the
personal income tax allowance, an extension of the
business rates relief for small businesses and a
restructuring of the stamp duty land tax system.

The main expenditure measures foreseen are extra
funding for the health system, financial support for
first-time exporters, additional funding for the
British Business Bank and investment in the
national roads network over the next six years. On
aggregate, the announced measures imply little
change to the fiscal balance.
Despite the Statement being fiscally neutral
overall, revisions to past GDP growth and the
growth outlook imply that the deficit forecast has
deteriorated. The deficit is now expected to fall to
4.4% of GDP in 2015-16 and to 3.4% of GDP in
2016-17. The consolidation foreseen over the latter
period was envisaged in the existing consolidation
plans. The structural balance is set to improve by
1.0 pp. over the two years to 2016-17 with the debt
ratio forecast to increase to reach 90.5% in the
final year of the forecast horizon.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Rebalancing of growth towards domestic demand

Strong investment growth, fuelled by public infrastructure projects and FDI boosted domestic demand
in 2014, which is expected to remain the only growth driver in 2015 and 2016. In spite of solid increases
in merchandise exports, the foreign balance likely proves a drag on GDP growth, as investment-related
import growth decelerates only slightly. The government relaxed its fiscal consolidation path, with
targeted budget deficits declining less rapidly than originally planned. While the rise in government
debt is moderate, financing needs of state-owned enterprises weigh heavily on the public debt level.
Domestic demand backs acceleration
output growth in 2014 and beyond

of

With strengthening domestic demand, growth
became more balanced in 2014, as a significant
surge in gross fixed capital formation
supplemented a strong increase in merchandise
exports. In the third quarter, output increased by
4.1% y-o-y in real terms, only slightly below the
speed of the preceding three months. The surge in
investment was carried by public infrastructure
spending and by an expansion of FDI-related
production capacities. A sizeable increase in
imports, however, spurred by the investment
boom, is likely to have led to a negative
contribution of net exports to growth in 2014 - a
marked difference from the preceding year, when
net exports were the sole growth driver. While
construction activity remained subdued, the
manufacturing sector benefited from the strong
export demand. Its output increased by some 10%
y-o-y in the first eleven months of 2014.
The sizeable commitments for road and rail
projects foreseen in the government's mid-term
fiscal strategy are likely to further bolster
investment growth, even though increases in
overall gross fixed capital formation are expected
to decline somewhat, mainly on account of the
completion of ongoing FDI capacity extensions,
and uncertain prospects of new projects in the
pipeline. Household spending may well increase
its contribution to domestic demand growth
gradually over the forecast horizon, supported by
steady rises in net wages - which returned to
positive growth in spring 2014 - a benign price
environment,
further
strengthening
credit
extension, and stable private transfers.
External balance remains a drag on growth

Export activity was surprisingly impressive in the
first ten months of 2014, though heavily
overcompensated by investment-related import
growth in both, goods and services. Merchandise

120

exports are expected to post significant growth
rates also in 2015 and 2016, with new FDI
production lines being exploited, and will continue
to provide the biggest contribution to GDP growth,
with the main downside risk stemming from
fledgling external demand. Strong investmentrelated, and, gradually, also consumption-related
import growth is likely to lead to a slight
deterioration in the current account, even though
private transfers are expected to remain stable.
External debt rose significantly during the third
quarter, mainly on account of the government's
500mn Eurobond launch in July, and, to a lesser
extent, disbursement of a World Bank loan in
August. Their level diminished since, as the
government started repaying IMF loans. Even with
sizeable repayments scheduled in 2015, reserves
are likely to remain adequate, bolstered by an
expected revitalisation of FDI inflows, and stable
private transfer income.

Manufacturing carries employment gains

Labour Force Survey figures for the third quarter
bolstered expectations, that there was further
improvement in the labour market in 2014, in
annual terms, with additional employment gains,
and a decline in the headline unemployment rate.
Job creation was particularly strong in

Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

manufacturing, reflecting demand from public
infrastructure projects and from export industries.
In the same period, there was virtually no
improvement in the high unemployment rate for
young workers, as structural problems of the
labour market persist. Further overall improvement
is expected over the next two years, as domestic
demand is strengthening, and export production in
the FDI sector would remain robust.

Debt levels will remain elevated

While the rise in central government debt is likely
to remain contained, state enterprises, in particular
the Public Enterprise for State Roads, through
which the government manages most of its road
infrastructure spending, will require significant
financing in 2015 and 2016. Hence, overall public
sector debt is expected to increase to well over
50% of GDP over the forecast horizon.

Fiscal consolidation based on revenue growth

Government revenue picked up strongly in the
second half of 2014, reflecting a sizeable increase
in both, direct taxes and VAT. However, given an
unexpectedly strong surge in transfer payments in
the fourth quarter, this is unlikely to have
prevented an overshooting of the target for the
general government deficit, which had been
revised upwards by 0.2 pp, to 3.7% of GDP in the
summer. The new medium-term fiscal strategy,
adopted in autumn 2014, relaxed the deficit targets
for 2015 and 2016 compared to the previous
strategy, with consolidation based on faster growth
of revenues than of expenditure. Given that the
government has not yet laid out concrete
consolidation measures on the expenditure side,
keeping the deficit targets may prove a challenge.

Less buoyant than expected

Third quarter data points to weaker private consumption, while imports remain strong. As a result,
domestic production in 2014 is likely to be markedly lower than expected in autumn. Low import prices
and moderate wage agreements will keep inflation close to the Central Bank target. The labour market
situation will continue to benefit from tourism. The overall favourable economic environment and a
modernisation of Iceland's tax system will support public finances and a continued debt reduction.
Third quarter data points to weaker growth
dynamics and lower inflation

Lower than expected private consumption in the
third quarter indicates a weaker economic dynamic
in the second half of 2014. As a result of a weak
first and third quarter, year-on-year GDP growth
was only 0.5% in the first three quarters of the
year. High imports, but also weak private
consumption, have been the main reasons for this
performance. The rather weak growth of
commodity exports was more than offset by strong
service exports, in particular tourism, registering
record high inflows in 2014.

The labour market situation continued to improve,
with employment increasing by some 2% in 2014.
However, job creation took mainly place in lowskilled and low wage sectors, partly reflecting the
expansion of tourism. By December, the
seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate had
declined to 4.3%, compared to 4.7% a year before.

However, the existence of capital controls is likely
to impede Iceland's attractiveness for incoming
FDI. Total exports are projected to benefit from a
flourishing tourism sector. However, higher
imports due to stronger domestic demand will
largely offset the positive effects of higher tourism
revenues.

Inflation dropped markedly in 2014, reaching 2%
on annual average, compared to 3.9% in 2013. The
main reasons for this deceleration were lower oil
prices, a strong currency and moderate wage
agreements. As a result, real wages increases were
significant. Together with strong employment
growth, low inflation contributed to a marked
increase in real disposable income.

The labour market situation is likely to continue
improving

After a general government deficit of -1.7% of
GDP in 2013, public sector accounts registered a
slight surplus of some 1% of GDP in the first three
quarters of 2014. The main underlying factors
were a one-off dividend payment of a largely stateowned bank, but also strong growth of direct taxes.
Solid real disposable income is likely to
support growth in 2015-16

Key
determinants
for
Iceland's
growth
performance in 2015-16 will be tourism, private
investment as well as private consumption,
benefitting from lower inflation and government

122

measures to boost disposable income, such as the
announced household debt relief programme.

Thanks to solid growth and new employment
opportunities in tourism and construction, labour
market conditions are likely to continue
improving. Annual average unemployment thus
could drop to around 4% by 2016. However, most
new jobs are likely to be in lower wage segments.
Addressing long-term unemployment will remain
an important challenge.
Inflation is expected to remain below the Central
Bank target of 2.5% in 2015, reflecting reduced
inflation expectations, below-potential growth, but
also benefitting from government plans to reduce
tax rates on VAT and to abolish commodity taxes.
However, in 2016, those inflation containing
factors are expected to fade out, which could push
inflation again above the Central Bank target.

Candidate Countries, Iceland

Strong domestic demand will lead to a
widening of external imbalances

As a result of stronger domestic demand, the
surplus in trade in goods will turn into a deficit
during the forecast period, while the services
balance is expected to continue benefitting from
expanding tourism. Overall, the current account is
likely to deteriorate over the forecast period.

Reducing public debt remains a challenge

In view of the favourable fiscal performance in the
first three quarters of 2014, the forecast expects a
fiscal surplus of about 1.3% of GDP in 2014. The
government fiscal target for 2015 of a largely
balanced budget is well in line with the underlying
economic growth projection. However, plans to
lower the tax burden might result in a slight deficit
in 2016, of about –0.5% of GDP. Substantial
primary surpluses (of some 3% of GDP) will help
to reduce the general government debt-to-GDP
ratio close to 75% by 2016. Government plans to
sell state assets in order to lower the public debt
burden could lead to an even faster reduction in the
debt ratio.

Uncertainties and risks stemming from the 2008
crisis are not overcome yet

Settling still existing claims towards banks in
insolvency could lead to substantial currentaccount outflows. Lifting capital controls thus still
remains a major challenge. Furthermore, higher
imports as a result of strong domestic demand
could create additional pressure on external
accounts, the exchange rate and domestic price
stability.

31. MONTENEGRO

The long road to growth

The country recorded a mild recovery in 2014, reflecting failing industrial production and exports.
Domestic demand remains constrained by limited and expensive bank lending. After several years of
cuts into capital investment, the government will launch in 2015 the construction of a major highway.
The project is set to have an important impact on growth, although fiscal risks require close attention.
Weak performance in 2014

Set for investment-driven growth

The economy recorded a modest 1.1% growth in
the first three quarters of 2014 and, although some
improvements were recorded in the last couple of
months, we do not expect a major improvement in
the last quarter. In the first eleven months of last
year, industrial production declined by 11% y-o-y,
pulling down merchandise exports. Tourism, one
of the main engines of growth, recorded a meagre
increase in the number of visitors, resulting in a
weak expansion of retail sales, and therefore in
private consumption. On a more positive note,
although bank lending contracted, credit to
households remained on positive territory, the total
number of workers augmented and construction,
together with an increase in public capital
spending, feed the expansion in investments.

In our autumn forecast we reviewed our growth
projections downwards due to the delay of some
large infrastructure investments. As of 2015, we
expect works to intensify in two large tourism
resorts (Porto Novi and Lustica), and above all, the
start of the first section of the highway BarBoljare. The latter will have substantial fallouts for
this relatively small economy. At this early stage
(detailed design has just commenced) it is difficult
to evaluate to which extent local workers,
construction companies as well as building
materials will effectively participate in the works,
or be instead substituted by imports. By and large,
this project could become the key driver of growth
in the next years or constitute a substantial fiscal
risk if not carefully managed.

Stimulus for domestic demand

The entry of three new banks in the financial
system has been announced for early 2015, which
–together with some IFIs credit lines for SMEs–
could improve credit supply gradually, in
particular to businesses. Still, banks' lending
capacity will remain constrained so far as they do
not reduce the high level of non-performing loans
(NPLs) in their portfolios.

124

On the one hand, the main import items in
Montenegro are oil products and food (the latter
mostly from Serbia). The sharp fall in oil prices
and the devaluation of the dinar could help to
reduce the trade deficit while improving disposable
income. These cheaper imports will also exert
downwards pressure on headline inflation,
although a lower price might also incite additional
consumption of the same products marginally.
On the other hand, the main exports goods of
Montenegro are aluminium and electricity. These
two commodities have some correlation with oil
prices, but the sharp decline of oil prices –if
sustained– could lead to weakening export prices
for these commodities too. Another very important
export is tourism and one of its key markets is
Russia. Although the economic sanctions did not
have a negative impact on the number of Russian
tourists in 2014, the strong devaluation of their
currency could have adverse consequences in

Candidate Countries, Montenegro

2015, making travel to other currency areas less
affordable. However, should Russian tourists shy
from more expensive Western destinations,
cheaper Montenegro may benefit from a
favourable substitution effect. Many Russians
already own property in Montenegro, but owners
could decide to cash-in instead of keeping property
as reserve value and for leisure.
Fiscal risks are substantial

In the first eleven months of 2014, the budget
deficit improved markedly to 0.7% of GDP,
compared to 3.7% a year earlier. The reduction of
the fiscal gap was underpinned by strong revenue
growth that offset a mild spending increase. Thus,
until November, budget revenue expanded
by 9% y-o-y, while total expenditures increased by
0.6% y-o-y despite a surge in capital expenditures
(by 33% y-o-y). In October 2014, the public debt
declined marginally to 57.9% of GDP, down from
58.1% at the end of 2013, with external debt
accounting for 80% of the total.
The greatest immediate risk for fiscal sustainability
is the rollover of the 5-year Eurobond issue of
EUR 398 million (or 10% of GDP) maturing in

2015. The main hazard being the exacerbation of
markets turmoil (following the elections in Greece)
raising the yield of the Montenegrin bonds.
The second largest risk is the financing of the
highway. The total cost is estimated at around 20%
of GDP (or 5% of GDP per year, during the 4
years construction). Moreover, 80% of the funds
are already secured by a loan from the Chinese
Exim bank with very favourable financing
conditions, with a grace period of six years (i.e. to
start reimbursing two years after finalising the
construction) and 2% interest rate. There is also an
exchange rate risk, the loan being extended in US
dollars. At present, with the depreciation of the
euro against the dollar, it will increase the
purchasing power of the borrower, but this
situation could reverse in the future. Another
important risk is the over-costs, covered to some
extent by a performance bond issued by the
Chinese construction companies. The project will
require a strict management and the preparation of
contingent fiscal plans in case of slippage, but also,
in case of faltering economic growth and/or
inflation, two important factors to help reducing
public debt in nominal terms.

A protracted recovery

The recession in 2014 turned out deeper than expected. Impacted by heavy floods in the spring and a
weaker external environment, growth decelerated strongly in the third quarter. The projected slow
economic recovery, in particular of investments, is seen to depend on the confidence in the undertaken
structural and fiscal reforms.
The recession in 2014 was deeper than
expected

Impacted by the heavy floods in the spring and
weaker external environment, the economy is
estimated to have contracted by 2% in 2014.
Following a drop of 1.3% y-o-y in the second
quarter, the recession deepened in the third quarter
when real GDP fell by 3.6%. Domestic demand,
which had already been a drag on growth,
weakened further with all components registering
negative growth rates in the third quarter.
Despite some signs of revival of credit activity,
encouraged by a programme of government
subsidised lending, investments entered their
eighth consecutive quarter of decline. In a marked
reversal of trend, exports performance worsened
significantly, turning from a 9.5% y-o-y growth in
the second to a decline of 5.7% in the third quarter.
Subdued external demand from major trading
partners added to the effects caused by the floods,
and exports deteriorated across most of the
commodity groups. High-frequency indicators, like
industrial production, suggest that the recession
has continued in the last quarter of the year.

Having reached their lowest level in years,
investment is expected to reach its trough in 2015.
Although a very high share of non-performing
loans and limited credit demand are likely to
continue acting as a brake on investment activity, a
set of recently adopted structural reforms is
expected to facilitate a better business and
investment environment. In addition, several big
infrastructure projects in the transport and energy
sectors remain a possible upside risk to investment.
Labour market indicators improved strongly in
2014. However, employment gains were driven
predominantly by informal employment, while
formal private sector employment declined. As the
announced restructuring of state-owned enterprises
gathers pace in 2015 and the government revisits
public employment, unemployment is foreseen to
increase from a still very high level.

Has investment reached its low?

The forecast foresees a mild recession in 2015,
softened by falling international oil prices. Fiscal
consolidation efforts are expected to take a toll on
growth, in particular, on public and private
consumption. Both are seen to contribute
negatively to growth throughout the forecast
horizon. The effects of the 2014 floods will be felt
next year as well, especially in the mining and
energy sector, where repair is still ongoing and
reconstruction activities will have some positive
effect on domestic demand. Coupled with a slow
rebound in Serbia's export markets, they would
contribute to a rather subdued exports
performance. However, risks to exports are mostly
balanced, as recent gains in price competitiveness
and announced investments in export-oriented
sectors, not included in the baseline scenario, may
soften effects from geopolitical uncertainty.

Price stability

Price stability has been a remarkable achievement,
as inflation remained on average at close to 2% in
2014. A number of factors, ranging from the weak
domestic demand, the fall in international oil
prices, delayed adjustments in administered prices,
and diminished price pressures in the major trading
partners have contributed to restrain inflation. As
weak domestic demand is projected to remain a
major disinflationary factor, inflation is expected

to remain subdued and relatively stable throughout
most of the forecasting period.

General government debt (rhs)
General government balance (lhs)

Fiscal consolidation efforts intensified in the
autumn, and the 2014 budgetary performance
turned out better than expected. However,
expenditures related to servicing called
government guarantees, taking over obligations of
other publicly-owned entities, and net acquisition
of financial assets, are estimated to have added

additional about 2 percentage points of GDP to the
headline deficit in 2014.
While there is still no clarity on the medium-term
fiscal strategy, the recently adopted set of
consolidation measures, including a cut in
pensions and government wages and the
announced steps to restructure state-owned
enterprises and reduce state exposure to them, have
send a strong signal about government intentions
to rein in fiscal imbalances. As a result of these
measures, the budget deficit is expected to fall to a
bit less than 4% of GDP in 2016, although reform
costs, higher interest payments, and recovering
government investments are seen as still keeping
the deficit very high in 2015. By the end of the
forecast horizon, government debt is expected to
go over 80% of GDP, indicating that further
measures may be needed to reverse its growth.
Uncertainties regarding budgetary execution are
likely to remain elevated. The restructuring of
state-owned
enterprises
and
the
timely
implementation of the announced structural
reforms would be key tests for the government's
commitment to reform the inefficient public sector
and reduce expenditure in a sustainable way.

33. TURKEY

Oil price drop a boon to growth, inflation and the current account

Output growth has declined in recent quarters, partly as a result of falling exports to Russia, Ukraine
and the Middle East. The Turkish lira's real appreciation in 2014 will hamper export growth, but at the
same time the economy will benefit from lower energy prices. Inflation is expected to decline
significantly, growth will be boosted by the rise in consumers' purchasing power, and the reduced
outlay for imported energy will narrow the current account deficit.
A rebalancing of growth in 2014

The Turkish economy slowed sharply in the spring
of 2014 and GDP growth had declined to 1.7%
y-o-y by the third quarter. Private domestic
demand, in particular, softened in the course of the
year and contributed little to annual growth. Weak
consumer
spending
reflected
decelerating
household borrowing which was induced by
macro-prudential measures and interest rate hikes
in January. Business investment was pushed into
negative growth territory in the first half of the
year by tighter financial conditions and was still
flat year-on-year in the third quarter.
Sluggish domestic demand was to a large extent
offset by improving net exports. Apart from
monetary tightening, net exports benefitted from a
more competitive exchange rate in the early part of
the year and from sharply lower imports of nonmonetary gold. The overall export performance
would have been even better – and annual GDP
growth higher – if exports to Russia, Ukraine and
Iraq had not shrunk.

policy significantly. Subsequently, the currency
recovered and the risk premium on Turkish assets
declined, allowing the central bank to lower the
one-week repo rate gradually to 8.25% by July.
With headline inflation hovering around 9%, the
central bank refrained from additional cuts in its
key policy rate in the remainder of the year. In
January 2015, however, the central bank loosened
monetary conditions by cutting the one-week repo
rate to 7.75% following improving inflation data
and pressure from government and president. The
central bank has made further interest rate cuts
conditional on improvements in the inflation
outlook. This should materialise in the context of
lower oil prices, the current slack in the economy,
and the lira's recent appreciation.
Private domestic demand will again become
the main driver of growth

The lira appreciated by 6.1% in real effective
terms in 2014 which has once more reduced
Turkey's international price competitiveness.
Exports will also be hurt by lower energy prices
which tend to suppress growth in many of Turkey's
traditional markets (Russia, Middle East). At the
same time, imports will be stimulated by
improving terms of trade. Consequently, the
contribution from net exports to GDP growth is
projected to decline to zero in 2015.

On the domestic side, private consumption
expenditure is likely to recover from its recent
sluggishness. Purchasing power is boosted by
lower energy prices and stabilising food prices
while wages are still rising at an annual rate of
close to 10%. Although last year's macroprudential measures will continue to restrain
household borrowing, the on-going easing of
monetary policy should provide some stimulus to
consumption. Business fixed investment has been
weak for some time, but in view of the improving
prospects for consumer demand and lower interest
rates and production costs, gross fixed capital
formation is projected to increase moderately over
the forecast period.

Candidate Countries, Turkey

Firmer growth and receding inflation

With a strong first quarter but sluggish growth in
the rest of the year, annual GDP growth is
estimated to register 2.8% in 2014. Based
primarily on the oil price stimulus and easier
monetary policy, output growth is expected to
increase to 3.7% in 2015 and 4.0% in 2016. One
downside risk to this forecast is the possibility of a
renewed sell-off in Turkish financial assets as US
monetary policy normalises. This could require a
tightening of Turkish monetary policy with
negative repercussions for private domestic
demand. Another risk is a worsening geo-political
situation in the Middle East and in Russia/Ukraine.
Employment growth is expected to run somewhat
below output growth, reflecting a reduced trend
growth rate for labour productivity. Annual
average unemployment in both 2015 and 2016 is
projected at 10.5% of the labour force aged
15-64 years. This projection is based on the
assumption that the labour force will increase
slightly below the 4% trend growth rate of recent
years. Annual average consumer price inflation is
expected to fall by about 3 pps. to around 6%.
Turkey's large current account deficit narrowed to
an estimated 6.0% of GDP in 2014 much helped

by lower imports of non-monetary gold. In 2015,
the recent oil price drop will reduce the deficit to
below 4% of GDP. In 2016, the assumed firming
of the oil price and continued strengthening of
domestic demand should result in a modest
widening of the current account deficit.
Public finances remain stable and sustainable

The central government recorded a budget deficit
of 1.3% of GDP in 2014, up by 0.1 pp. from the
preceding year, but lower than the initial and
revised official targets of 1.9% and 1.4%,
respectively. The better-than-planned performance
was helped by privatisation revenues. The forecast
estimates the general government deficit to
correspond to 1.5% of GDP in 2014 and projects it
to decline slightly in the following two years in
tune with firmer GDP growth and accelerating tax
revenues.
After pausing in 2013 due to exchange rate effects,
the public debt-to-GDP ratio resumed its
downward trend in 2014 to an estimated 34.3%.
On the basis of the current projections for fiscal
deficit and nominal GDP, the debt ratio will
continue declining in the following two years.

34. ALBANIA

Domestic demand drives growth recovery

The latest data indirectly confirm the firming of private consumption, boosted also by a lower-thanexpected inflation. One of the factors behind this is the fall in international oil prices, which however
seems a mixed blessing for Albania, as it might also affect energy sector investments and the price tag of
Albanian crude exports. Overall, the outlook is for a strengthening growth momentum and improving
fiscal balances. The current account deficit is set to widen further.
Third quarter sees growth revival

In the third quarter of 2014, the economy
rebounded vigorously from the (partly base effectrelated) slump experienced in the previous quarter
and expanded by 3.3% y-o-y. All main sectors of
the economy provided positive contribution, with
the biggest one coming, similarly to the previous
quarter, from services (1.9 pps.) driven mainly by
a booming trade, hotels and restaurants sector (up
10.4% y-o-y). Construction expanded by 7.5% in
annual terms, reversing the steep fall seen in the
first half of the year and contributing 0.8 pp. to
growth. The industrial sector also managed to
overturn its second-quarter contraction, although
its growth rate, at 2.5% y-o-y, was much below the
average of the past years due to weaker electricity
production. The growth of agriculture was also
subdued at 1.2% y-o-y. These data, supported also
by retail trade indicators, confirm that the
strengthening of private consumption continues
and drives much of the reacceleration of growth.
Graph II.34.1: Albania - Real GDP growth and contributions
6

Moreover, subdued food prices and the fall in the
oil price contribute to lower inflation than
previously expected (consumer price inflation
decelerated to 0.7% y-o-y in December from 1.9%
a year earlier), and their effect is likely to extend
into 2015, boosting consumers' purchasing power.
The third quarter growth rebound was also
accompanied by a healthy increase in nonagricultural private-sector jobs, but consumer
confidence indicators failed to improve at year
end. Financial conditions continued to ease in the
second half of the year (credit growth accelerated
to 3.3% y-o-y in October and 3.8% in November)
reflecting monetary stimulus and increased credit
demand, although the high level of non-performing
loans and the continued need to clean up bank
balance sheets constitute a risk to the outlook. In
the context of below-target inflation and still
underused production capacities, Bank of Albania
cut its policy rate further to an historic low of
2.25% in November. It is expected to stay on its
accommodative policy course as inflation is
projected to move only slowly towards the target
of 3% ±1 pp.

pps.

This leads us to slightly improve forecasts for
private consumption growth in the years to come.
On the other hand, the lower oil price is expected
to dampen somewhat the increase in gross fixed
capital formation, as it might put a break on some
projects in oil exploration and extraction which in
recent years attracted sizeable foreign investments.

Domestic demand on the rise

The recently published first estimate of GDP
growth in 2013, at 1.4%, also indicates that
domestic demand turned the corner already that
year and, similarly to the autumn forecast, we
expect this trend to continue.

130

The increase in domestic absorption causes the
current account deficit to widen further. Moreover,
the positive terms-of-trade effect of a lower price
for oil imports is partly offset by the fact that crude
oil is also a relatively important export commodity
for Albania.
In July to September, the current account deficit
grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, by 66.3%
y-o-y, driven by a higher merchandise trade deficit
(up 14.1% y-o-y). In the four quarters to

Candidate Countries, Albania

September, the current account deficit rose to
12.4% of GDP from 9.3% in the corresponding
period a year earlier. However, vulnerabilities
linked to growing external imbalances will be
mitigated in the years to come by an expected
strong inflow of foreign direct investment, related
in particular to the Albanian section of the TransAdriatic Pipeline and a major hydropower project.
2014 budget outperforms as expenditure lags
behind

The 2014 budget outcome, at 5.1% of estimated
full-year GDP, undershot the target of 6.3% that
had already been revised downwards in September
from the initial estimate of 6.6%. Reflecting rate
hikes as well as efforts to improve tax collection,
revenues increased by 12.1% y-o-y, broadly in line
with the revised plan. The biggest contribution
came from a 10.6% y-o-y surge in net VAT
receipts. However, it was the shortfall of
expenditure that kept the deficit below target. Both
operating expenses and investment spending
undershot the budgeted amount by a substantial
margin, causing total expenditure to remain 3.9%
below plan.

Overall, last year's deficit was only slightly higher
than a year earlier, which is remarkable given that
the budget also had to accommodate the repayment
of a large portion of government arrears to
businesses, amounting to 2.4% of GDP.
The 2015 budget, discussed with the IMF under
Albania's on-going loan arrangement and adopted
by the Parliament in November, raises excise and
fuel taxes as well as the tax levied on capital
income. This, coupled with an expected
continuation of efficiency gains in tax collection
and a growing economy, is expected to underpin a
revenue increase of around 10% in nominal terms.
This should create space for the continuation of
arrears clearance, modest increases in government
consumption, as well as a better execution of
public investment plans. However, the main fiscal
objective remains the lowering of the very high
level of public debt to below 60% in the medium
term; the decrease is projected to begin this year.
Downside risks emanate however from the
possible fiscal impact of electricity sector woes
and the scheme that pays compensation for
property expropriated during communism.

35. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Sliding oil prices boost the outlook

The outlook for the US economy improved further since the autumn as the boost to activity from sharply
lower energy prices is set to outweigh the negative impact of the stronger dollar, while strong GDP
growth and solid labour markets strengthen the momentum into 2015. Real GDP growth is thus revised
up to 2.4% and 3.5% in 2014 and 2015 from the Autumn Forecast, and left unchanged at 3.2% in 2016.
Cheaper oil to boost short-term outlook

The outlook for the US economy improved further
since the autumn, largely thanks to sharply lower
energy prices and a stronger-than-expected growth
momentum in the second half of 2014. Real GDP
growth accelerated to 1.2% q-o-q in the third
quarter, the strongest in 9 years, from 1.1% in the
second. Growth was driven primarily by private
consumption, as well as business investment,
which continues to firm following a prolonged
weakness in 2012-13.
Moreover, lower oil prices provide a major boost
to private consumption, which accounts for
roughly 70% of US GDP. The progressively
strengthening dollar, potentially lower capital
investment in the energy sector and more moderate
expansion of energy output may temper the effect
of lower oil prices. However, on balance, the net
impact on real GDP growth is expected to be
positive, leading to an upward revision of growth
to 2.4% and 3.5% in 2014 and 2015, up by 0.2 pp.
and 0.4 pp. from the Autumn Forecast. The
forecast for 2016 is left unchanged at 3.2%, given
the assumed gradual rebound in energy prices and
the moderating effect of the stronger dollar.
Solid investment despite weakness in the
energy sector

Business investment is expected to continue
expanding robustly, despite some deceleration in
the energy sector. Sharply lower oil prices have led
to a moderation in energy output growth and
triggered a decisive cut in the related investment
plans. However, weaker capital spending in some
energy-related industries is set to be outweighed
by a stronger rebound in other sectors where a
positive supply shock related to cheaper oil is
expected to boost investment amid firming
domestic and foreign demand, still conducive
financing conditions and record-high corporate
profits.

Booming consumption

Private consumption is expected to strengthen
considerably in 2015, as lower inflation will
interact with a buoyant labour market to boost
spending. Lower energy prices will not only have a
direct real income effect, but may, via indirect
effects, also boost spending on the core part of the
consumer basket. The ensuing surge in real income
is expected to push real consumer spending growth
to nearly 4% y-o-y, the highest in 10 years. The
expected gradual rebound in government spending
will further support domestic demand in the
forecast horizon.
However, the US is set to lose competitiveness due
to a progressively strengthening dollar (15%
appreciation in trade-weighted exchange rate since
July) and a narrowing of the energy price gap
vis-à-vis its competitors. This implies a downward
revision of export growth, and an upward revision
to imports, where a stronger dollar interacts with
the energy related surge in domestic demand.
No price and wage pressures despite buoyant
labour market

Buoyant job creation, combined with the gradual
decline in the participation rate, brought the
unemployment rate down to 5.6% by the end of

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

2014. Non-farm employment grew by 290,000 on
average in the fourth quarter, the strongest
quarterly result since 1999. These improvements,
however, have occurred amid a steady decline in
the participation rate, which fell to 62.7% in
September, a 37-year low. As the economy
strengthens, job creation is expected to remain
solid, bringing the unemployment rate down to 5%
in 2016, around the natural rate. A cyclical
expansion of the labour force will prevent more
decisive declines in the unemployment rate in the
forecast horizon.
Despite the recovery in the labour market, prices
and wage inflation are likely to remain subdued.
Sharp movements in energy prices are expected to
push headline CPI inflation temporarily down to 0.1% y-o-y in 2015, to subsequently fuel its
recovery back to 2.0% in 2016, with core inflation
showing considerably more stability. Lower
inflation will boost the real value of wages, which
otherwise have been rather weak (nominal average
hourly earnings decelerated to 1.7% y-o-y in
December, the slowest in 2 years). However, both
price and wage pressures are expected to pick up

gradually as the effect of the energy price deflation
wanes in the second half of 2015 and the output
gap closes progressively.
Activity will be supported by accommodative
monetary policy and easing fiscal drag

Other factors shaping the US outlook remain
largely unchanged. Considerably lower fiscal drag
and continued highly accommodative monetary
policies will boost activity in the forecast horizon.
The general government deficit is expected to have
fallen below 5% in 2014, for the first time since
2007, amid a consolidation progressing at a milder
pace compared to previous years. Smaller deficits
will lead to a gradual decline in debt levels over
the forecast horizon, from 105% of GDP in 2014
to 104% in 2016. In order to assure the markets
that interest rate hikes will not be immediate, the
Fed indicated in December that it will be "patient"
with normalizing policy. While its projections
continue to point to mid-2015 as the start of the
cycle of cautious interest rates increases, the
current oil-price-driven drop in inflation adds to
the complexity surrounding the decision.

Moderate growth rebound expected, but fiscal challenges remain

Real GDP growth for 2014 was revised substantially down following two consecutive quarters of
negative growth in Q2 and Q3. In 2015, the low carry-over from 2014 will be offset by postponed fiscal
consolidation, stronger monetary stimulus and a positive oil price shock. Real GDP growth is therefore
expected to pick up again to 1.3%, and to remain at the same level in 2016 thanks to supportive fiscal
and monetary policy and favourable energy prices.
Unexpected slump in 2014

The Japanese economy unexpectedly entered
technical recession in 2014-Q3 with a -0.5% q-o-q
contraction. The contraction in Q3 followed a
largely anticipated -1.7% decline in Q2 in the
wake of April's consumption tax hike. After a
strong increase in Q2, inventory levels declined
sharply in Q3. Private residential and nonresidential investment failed to rebound, whilst
private consumption recovered only marginally.
Overall the underlying pace of growth triggered by
expansionary monetary policy proved insufficient
to withstand tightening fiscal policy against a
background of timid structural reform and negative
real wage growth. Economic activity is expected to
have rebounded in Q4, but the drag from two
quarters of negative growth entails a substantial
downward revision of annual real GDP growth to
0.3%. The lower carry-over from 2014 weighs on
2015 growth. However, several factors should
contribute to lifting the growth trajectory. The
postponement from October 2015 to April 2017 of
the second consumption tax hike (from 8% to
10%) and a new ¥3.1 trillion (0.6% of GDP)
stimulus package will underpin domestic demand
in the near term. Monetary policy turned even
more accommodative as the Bank of Japan stepped
up the pace of asset purchases at the end of
October 2014. Finally, lower energy prices will not
be fully offset by the depreciation of the yen, and
will materialise into a positive oil price shock
given Japan's increased energy dependence on
imported fossil fuels in the aftermath of the Great
East Japan Earthquake. In 2015 growth is therefore
set to accelerate to 1.3%, and to remain around the
same level in 2016.
Outlook for private consumption improves…

Private consumption has been recovering only
slowly from the slump following the consumption
tax hike over the second half of 2014, and is
estimated to have remained below its 2013 level.
However the household sector is set to gradually
strengthen on the back of the postponed

136

consumption tax hike, lower energy prices and an
– albeit moderate – pick-up in wage growth. With
the unemployment rate at an 18-year-low (3.5% in
November), labour market conditions are expected
to remain tight over the forecast horizon
underpinned by strengthening domestic and
external demand and a shrinking working age
population.

…and investment conditions continue to be
supportive.

Gross fixed capital formation contributed
negatively to growth in Q2 and Q3 as private
investment contracted. Corporate profits remain
however strong and will be supported by Yen
depreciation and improving domestic and external
demand. Loose financing conditions will persist
over the medium term underpinned by
accommodative monetary policy. Against this
backdrop, private non-residential investment is
expected to progressively expand in 2015 and
2016. Private residential investment should have
bottomed out in 2014-Q4, and will slowly recover
supported by favourable lending conditions. Public
investment is set to decline more gradually than
expected in the Autumn Forecast on the back of a
new ¥3.1 trillion (0.6% of GDP) stimulus package,
around half of which is earmarked for
infrastructure and public works.

Other non-EU Countries, Japan

Stronger external demand

Net exports are expected to contribute more
strongly to near-term growth than in the Autumn
Forecast. Lower commodity prices will help
enhancing the competitiveness of the export sector,
and underpin more robust export growth together
with firming external demand, in particular from
the US. Demand for imports should strengthen
gradually as domestic demand recovers.
Wage growth picks up mildly, but inflation
slows

Cost-push inflationary pressures from currency
depreciation have been largely offset by softer
energy prices. As a result headline Consumer Price
Index (CPI) inflation declined from a peak 3.7%
year-on-year (including the tax hike effect) in June
2014 to 2.4% in November. Whilst the waning
effect from the past consumption tax hike and
continued moderation in global commodity prices
will entail downward pressures on prices, CPI
inflation should stabilise as domestic demand firms
up. Continued tightness in the labour market is set

to moderately lift wage growth, with nominal
compensation per head expected to average 0.6%
over the forecast period. Against this backdrop,
headline CPI inflation is projected to slow in 2015
and gradually rise to around 0.9% by 2016.
Fiscal consolidation is postponed

Revenue growth was boosted by the April 2014
consumption tax hike. However the postponement
of the second tax hike, a new fiscal package aimed
at boosting near-term growth, and a steady
increase in social security expenditure will entail
larger fiscal deficits, and a possible slippage of the
target to halve the primary deficit by FY2015
relative to its 2010 level. Uncertainty surrounding
the direction of fiscal policy and the fiscal outlook
has increased following the postponement of the
October 2015 consumption tax hike. It is not clear
yet either how the planned cut in the corporate tax
rate will be offset on the revenue side. On the
expenditure side, preparations for the 2020
Olympics may entail additional spending pressures
over the forecast period.

Property slowdown fails to dent headline growth in 2014

China's growth held up remarkably well in 2014, despite a weak start to the year and a property market
downturn. Consumption held up well, and a recovery in exports in late 2014 helped offset weaker
investment. This pattern is expected to continue, with lower oil prices helping to boost consumption and
underpin faster growth in the Asia region, thereby supporting exports. Risks have become more
balanced, with upside risks from lower oil prices now weighing against downside risks from the
property sector and associated risks to financial stability.
A solid outcome despite signs of domestic
weakness

China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, following
growth of 7.8% in 2013. The 2014 outcome proved
remarkably solid given the abrupt slowdown in the
property market that started in late 2013, and a
weak start to 2014 that saw a worsening of high
frequency indicators across the board. A series of
small-scale stimulus measures subsequently helped
to prop up growth in mid-year, before a rebound in
exports in the second half of the year pushed
growth back towards the official target for the year
of 7.5%. The slowdown in property and real estate
was accompanied by a broader slowdown in
investment, with (nominal) growth in fixed asset
investment dropping to 15% annually by year-end,
from around 20% or higher in recent years.
High frequency indicators provided a mixed
picture towards the end of 2014. Retail sales held
up well, continuing to grow at close to 12% in
nominal terms, similar to rates observed
throughout 2014. Industrial production edged
down however, with growth in real output heading
towards 7% at year-end compared to around 9% in
January. PMI measures also deteriorated
marginally in November, though both official and
private measures remain close to 50. Late 2014
also saw poor housing market data, with new starts
substantially down year on year, and with the fall
in house prices picking up speed.

Policy to remain accommodative and flexible

Monetary policy was eased in early 2014 in
response to the weak first quarter, with the
interbank rate moving well below 4%. This was
followed by selective cuts in required reserve
ratios for rural lenders, and a cut in headline policy
rates in November, the first for over two years.
Despite these changes, total credit growth (Total
Social Financing) was slack throughout the year,
with a fall of 5.2% compared to 2013. By contrast,
RMB bank loans increased by 5% y-o-y to end
November, suggesting that regulatory measures to
curb growth in "non-standard" lending have had
some traction. It is likely that monetary policy will
remain accommodative for some time, given the
continued weakness in the property sector and the
concerns that a "hard landing" would spill over
into the financial sector, with some property
developers exhibiting excessive leverage. Fiscal
policy is set to remain flexible, with any further
signs of weakness in domestic demand likely to be
met with fine-tuning of the flow of infrastructure
approvals in order to keep growth near its target.

The forecast is for growth to moderate further in
2015 to 7.1%, and 6.9% in 2016. This assumes a
relatively benign correction in the property market,
stabilization of growth in fixed asset investment,
continued steady growth of consumption, and
gradual rebalancing of the Chinese economy. The
official growth target for 2015, set at the March
National Peoples' Conference, is expected to be
around 7%, compared to 7.5% in 2014.

Falling oil prices will ease policy dilemmas

China's growth in 2015 and 2016 will be
buttressed by the recent fall in the oil price, which

138

Other non-EU Countries, China

will provide a significant boost due to China's
relatively high energy intensity.
Household consumption is expected to continue to
grow steadily in 2015, with lower energy prices
reinforcing the downward pressure on CPI
inflation, which had fallen to around 1.5% at the
end of 2014. Lower oil prices should also ease
pressure on the industrial sector which continues to
face a difficult environment, with persistent excess
capacity in some key sectors. Growth in
investment is expected to stabilise at rates close to
those seen in late 2014, though the weakness in the
property market may have further to run. The
support provided by lower oil prices may allow
Chinese policy makers to limit further stimulus
measures and press for a faster restructuring of the
Chinese economy, while running lower risks of a
"hard landing".
China's imports were extremely sluggish during
2014, and growth over the year was almost zero in
value terms. This may partly reflect a structural
shift in import demand linked to lower rates of
investment. Exports grew by 6% over the same
period, picking up sharply from June onwards. The
RMB exchange rate versus the US dollar rose by
2% during 2014, while against the euro it rose by

around 10%, and the real effective exchange rate
rose by 6.4%. Most of this strengthening of the
RMB in real terms came in the last quarter of the
year.
Although domestic consumption growth should
lead to a gradual revival of growth in imports, the
outperformance by exports may continue into
2015. The prospects of a strong export
performance have improved in recent months due
to the accelerating recovery in the US, and the
prospect of faster growth in the Asian region,
where a number of other economies will also
benefit substantially from lower oil prices.
Risks have become more balanced

The major risk factors remain those linked to
accumulated imbalances, notably the legacy of
debt from high levels of investment spending, the
risk of a sharper correction in the property sector,
and risks to the financial sector from exposure to
overleveraged borrowers. However risks are more
balanced than at the time of the autumn forecast,
with possible outperformance due to the positive
impacts of lower oil prices now set against the
downside risks from the property sector and
associated risks to financial stability.

Not all that steady anymore

Economic data in Switzerland and Norway continue to be volatile. After positive figures for the third
quarter and a significant upward revision of the second quarter growth rate in Switzerland, economic
growth is expected to have turned out somewhat better over the full year than previously foreseen. This
year, growth is expected to register 1.9% in Switzerland and 1.8% in Norway which is driven mostly by
domestic demand.
Economic data in Switzerland and Norway
continue to be volatile. This is particularly evident
for the headline trade figures of Switzerland after
the transition to the new national accounting
standards (ESA2010) but also for other indicators
like those for private consumption in Norway and
those for producer sentiment for both countries.
Moreover, in the case of Switzerland second
quarter growth figures were revised upwards from
no growth to +0.3% quarter-on-quarter and are
now more in line with expectations at the
beginning of the year.
Economic outlook for Switzerland

Economic growth accelerated in the third quarter
to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter from 0.3% in the
second quarter. The domestic demand components
that posed a drag on economic growth in the
second quarter contributed positively in the third
quarter: government consumption expanded by
0.9% quarter-on-quarter against -0.1% in the
second quarter and gross fixed investment
expanded by 0.5% against -0.6%. The exception
among domestic demand components was
inventory depletion which led to a significant drag
on domestic demand in the third quarter.
Domestic and foreign demand are both expected to
continue contributing to economic growth this year
and the next. Private consumption has been
growing above the historical average since 2011,
driven by easy financial conditions, healthy labour
market conditions, and wealth gains.
In 2015 and 2016, labour markets will continue to
support private demand. The unemployment rate
has been relatively stable over the past years. As
immigration becomes more difficult, the demand
for domestic labour is expected to meet with
upward pressure in the short term. The effect on
the labour market of tighter labour migration will,
however, be negative in the longer term. Recent
analyses have shown that labour migration has had
a positive impact on demand for domestic labour.

140

As a consequence of the Swiss National Bank
abandoning the floor of the EUR-CHF exchange
rate, downward pressures on prices will again
increase. The impact on real disposable income
will first be positive but there seems little scope for
nominal wage increases, also because of the
impact on total demand for Swiss goods and
services, and the resurgence of falling prices will
add to downward pressures on house prices.

Economic outlook for Norway

GDP growth in the mainland economy decreased
from 1.2% in the second quarter to 0.4% quarteron-quarter in the third quarter. Due to increased
activity in the off-shore sector, petroleum activities
and sea transport, the total economy grew by 0.5%
quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter after 1.1% in
the second quarter.
Final consumption expenditure by households
turned out to be a drag on the economy in the third
quarter even if consumer confidence had shown an
improvement compared to the earlier part of the
year. The decline in household consumption was
broad based, stretching from energy consumption
to purchases of food and beverages and to
vehicles. By contrast, in the fourth quarter,
consumer confidence declined but household
consumption went up in October and November

Other non-EU Countries, EFTA

with only purchases of food, beverages and
tobacco registering a decline. This is not an omen
of renewed dynamics in household consumption
for this year and the next. Rather, household
consumption growth will stay volatile as a
consequence of uncertainty over house prices, high
indebtedness of - in particular - young households,
repercussions of the falling oil price, and a cooling
of the labour market.

The recent fall in oil prices has started to impact
wages and labour demand in the oil and oil-related
sectors. The impact of the change in momentum in
this relatively small part of the labour market
(around 2% of all jobs) on the whole economy will
be felt mostly through confidence channels. In the
total economy, as a matter of fact, jobs were still
created although the momentum is waning.
The impact will not only be felt by households.
Investment by the off-shore sector is expected to
drop this year as confirmed by a survey in
December. This drop in investment will impact
domestic demand in the mainland economy as well
as labour demand. Because the reduced demand
for imported goods will be more than offset by a
decline in exports, the trade balance surplus will
decline.

Norway's inflation rate has been slightly above 2%
in the past two years. This year and the next,
inflation is expected to turn out slightly lower as
energy prices come down and there is loss in the
momentum of economic growth. Driving inflation
upwards is the depreciation of the Norwegian
krone that lost a tenth of its value against the euro
and a quarter against the US dollar since the
summer.

39. RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Moving into recession amidst falling oil prices and sanctions

The Russian economy is under severe pressure due to the combined effect of the collapse in oil prices,
economic sanctions and structural weaknesses of the Russian growth model. After experiencing some
growth resilience in 2014, Russia is expected to move into a deep recession in 2015, followed by some
stabilisation in 2016, as geo-political tensions are assumed to gradually subside and the oil price to
slightly pick up.
Moving to recession amidst falling oil prices
and sanctions

Economic growth in Russia has been on a
declining trend for some time as the energy exportled growth model ran out of steam, diversification
of the economy made little progress and
investment stalled. These trends are exacerbated
by the combined effect of a collapse in oil price
and economic sanctions, which have led to record
Rouble depreciation, severe financial pressures on
the banking and corporate sector and a major
deterioration of economic confidence.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Real GDP growth is expected to have slowed
down further in 2014 in the wake of geopolitical
tensions and economic sanctions, even though
economic activity showed some resilience up to
Q3 (resulting in average 0.8% growth in Q1-Q3
2014 y-o-y), supported by net exports and better
than expected outcomes in agriculture and
manufacturing. The growth slowdown was mainly
driven by a sharp contraction of investment and a
deceleration of private consumption, on the back
of rising capital outflows, soaring borrowing costs
and rising inflation.
The combination of the sharp fall in the oil price
and the economic sanctions are set to push the
Russian economy into a deep recession in 2015,

142

followed by some stabilisation in 2016, based on
the technical assumptions of an expiry of
economic sanctions in July 2015 and a slight
rebound in oil prices.
Investment collapsing and consumption falling

The collapse in investment is expected to continue
in 2015, reflecting a severe tightening of financing
conditions as access to Western capital markets is
becoming increasingly constrained for major
Russian banks and corporations amid sanctions,
increased borrowing costs, shortage of foreign
exchange liquidity, capital outflows, political and
economic uncertainty and a deteriorated business
environment.
A sharp fall in private consumption, which has
been a major growth driver in recent years, is
expected in 2015, followed by a moderate recovery
in 2016. This is due to a major squeeze of real
disposable incomes resulting from rising inflation,
caused by sharp Rouble depreciation and the ban
on Western food imports, and from limited fiscal
space for social spending and further wage hikes in
the public sector.
Exports are expected to fall in negative territory in
2015, as structural bottlenecks and collapsing
investments prevent Russian firms from reaping
the benefit of a falling Rouble. Exports are set to
recover somewhat in 2016 amid easing
geopolitical tensions, a gradual pick up of oil
prices and global economic recovery. Imports are
expected to contract substantially in 2015, on the
back of falling domestic demand and sharp Rouble
depreciation.
Negative effects on a so far tight labour market

The sharp worsening of the economic outlook is
set to also affect the Russian labour market. A
contraction of employment is expected in both
2015 and 2016 as a result of the upcoming
recession and the decline in working age
population. Similarly, unemployment is set to

Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation

increase quite markedly in 2015 and, to a lesser
extent, in 2016. Overall, employment losses will
remain relatively contained compared to the extent
of the GDP contraction, given a very tight labour
market.
Sharp rouble depreciation fuelling a surge in
inflation

Rouble depreciation, which already started in the
summer of 2014 amid growing geo-political
tensions, largely accelerated towards the end of
2014 as a result of a sharp fall in oil prices, with
the Russian currency reaching record lows in
December. The depreciation (and restrictions in
food imports) resulted in a sharp pick-up of
inflation which averaged 7.8% in 2014 and is
expected to accelerate further to 9.5% in 2015,
before slowing down to 7% in 2016 on the back of
base effects and a weakening economic
environment.
Monetary policy tightening (including a 650 bps.
rate hike) and additional measures by the Central
Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance,
including provision of foreign exchange liquidity

and support to the banking sector, helped stabilise
the situation at the end of 2014.
A worsening fiscal outlook

The general government balance is set to sharply
deteriorate in 2015 (after a slight improvement in
2014) as a result of the sharp fall in oil prices,
which squeezes government revenues (being only
partly compensated by a depreciating rouble), and
the economic recession. The fiscal balance is
expected to remain negative in 2016 amid a limited
oil price recovery and very gradual return to
positive growth. Capital injections to ailing banks
and corporates may also weigh on public finances,
although they should be largely accommodated by
tapping existing fiscal buffers.
Risks to the outlook

Downside risks to the outlook are related to
uncertainty about oil price developments and
financial stability risks associated with balance
sheet weaknesses of the banking and corporate
sector amid depreciating rouble and limited access
to financial markets.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-fledged
economic forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn. These forecasts
cover the principal macroeconomic aggregates for the Member
States, the candidate countries, the European Union as a whole, the
euro area and the international environment.
2. Data for 2014, 2015 and 2016 are forecasts. The source for all tables is
the European Commission, unless otherwise stated. Historical data
for the Member States are based on the European System of
Accounts (ESA 2010). US national accounts are based on SNA 2008,
whilst the Japanese accounts use SNA 1993.

3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4. In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for
USA and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to
1996.
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in
the capital stock and the difference between actual
unemployment and the NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on fulltime-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France,
Italy, the Netherlands and Austria report FTE data. In the absence of
FTE data, employment is based on numbers of persons. In the
calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates, priority is given to FTE
data, as this is regarded as more representative of diverse patterns
of working time.

the aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange
rates. Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area
"adjusted" balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area visà-vis third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of
the individual countries in the EU or the euro area. However, intra-EU
or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of reporting
errors. The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border
controls and formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of
intra-EU trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU imports are
underestimated compared to intra-EU exports, leading to an
overestimation of the surplus. For the past the "adjusted" balances
are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB estimates for the euro area. For
the future, they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of
the discrepancies observed in 2013.
9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA19 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LV, LT, LU, MT, NL, AT,
PT, SI, SK, and FI)
European Union :
EU28 (EA19, BG, CZ, DK, HR, HU, PL, RO, SE, and UK).
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia, and Albania.
Potential candidates :
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.
Asia :

7. Source: National Accounts (ESA 2010). Discrepancies with balance
of payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences
and revision schedules.
8.

EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates.
World GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS).
In the tables on world trade and international payments,

All countries in that region except Japan and the Asian
MENA countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA
countries.
