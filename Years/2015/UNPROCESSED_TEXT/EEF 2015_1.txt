 FOREWORD   ix 
The near-term outlook for the EU economy has clearly
 improved. After hitting a soft patch last spring, 
GDP growth in the EU picked up again towards the 
end of 2014. Survey indicat
ors and recent hard data 
suggest that the momentum is continuing, underpinned by three factors that boost GDP growth in the 

short run. Firstly, the sharp fall in oil prices has increased real household income and boosted consumer 

confidence; this is reflected in the recent strength of retail sales. Firms are also benefitting from lower 

energy costs, but strong signs of a pick-up in investment have still to materialise. Secondly, 

macroeconomic policy has become more supportive of
 growth. The aggregated fiscal policy stance has 
been neutral since last year and more recently, the 
ECB and several other central banks in the EU have 
decided measures to provide more ample monetary stimulus. The expanded asset purchase programme 

adopted by the ECB has lowered interest rates while stabilising inflation expectations, thus reducing the 

real interest rate. Thirdly, the euro™s exchange ra
te has depreciated strongly amid the ECB™s quantitative 
easing and the expectation that the US Fed will adop
t a less accommodative stance. 
This is expected to 
benefit the exports of euro area Member States while
 increasing import prices. Inflation is expected to 
pick up gradually and the risk of falling into outright deflation has markedly decreased. 
Indeed, the EU economy has rarely benefited from such a strong conjunction of support factors and risks 
to the near-term outlook now appear broadly balanced. But will the economy be able to generate a self-

sustained and balanced expansion once these temporary tailwinds fade? The answer is not self-evident. 

The legacy of the crisis will continue to be felt for years to come. To be sure, sectoral and external 

adjustment in countries with large pre-crisis imbalances has made good progress in recent years. Financial 

fragmentation is receding and the credit contraction is
 ending. The labour market situation is gradually 
improving, not least due to the structural reforms implemented in several Member States in recent years. 

But unemployment looks set to remain intolerably high for a long time. The level of debt, in particular 

corporate and sovereign, remains very high. The share of non-performing bank loans is elevated and 

continues to rise in some Member States. The shortfall of investment over the past six years has reduced 

economic growth potential. And, in a more medium-term perspective, the trend of declining productivity 

growth has not yet been reversed and population ageing will hamper the expansion of the labour force 

ever more strongly. 
To make the recovery sustainable and avoid the risk of falling back into anaemic growth, it will be 
essential to invigorate more permanent growth driver
s. Three sets of actions are imperative. First, a 
coordinated boost to investment. This could be achieved by re-orienting public expenditure towards more 

growth-enhancing investment and by swiftly implementing the Investment Plan for Europe. Second, a 

renewed commitment to growth-enhancing 
structural reforms, i.e. reforms in product, services and labour 
markets that increase product
ivity and foster investment. Reforms implemented in recent years in some 
Member States are starting to bear fruit and acc
ommodative monetary policies help facilitate their 
implementation and enhance their effectiveness. Third,
 the continued pursuit of fiscal responsibility. The 
current broadly-neutral aggregate fiscal stance is appropriate in light of the gradual recovery. Yet, in order 

to address both the short and medium-term challenge
s Europe faces, Member States with fiscal space 
should foster productive investment as those with larg
e deficits and/or debt consolidate. Everywhere, the 
composition of public finances can be designed in a more growth-friendly manner. 

 
Ensuring robust growth beyo
nd the benign outlook fo
r the near-term presented 
in this forecast heavily 
depends on the success of
 this policy agenda.

OVERVIEW   1 The outlook for economic growth in th
e EU has brightened. Recent hard and 
soft indicators confirm that a cyclical
 upswing driven by private consumption 
is underway and most data suggest that growth may still strengthen in the 

near term, as the economy receives an ex
tra boost from tailwind factors such 
as low oil prices, a weaker euro and quantitative easing (QE) from the 
European Central Bank. But despite the flattering effect of these positive 

factors, the pick-up in activity has yet to spread to a broad range of sectors 

and clouds loom over the horizon. Geopolitical tensions with Russia and high 

unemployment rates in some Member States continue to weigh on GDP 
growth. 
The combined strength of a number of positive factors blowing in the EU™s 
direction underpin a slight upward revision for GDP growth this year. Real 

GDP growth in the euro area is no
w expected to pick up from 0.9
% last year 
to 1.5% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016. In the EU, GDP growth is now forecast to 
rise from 1.4% in 2014 to 1.8% this year and 2.1% in 2016
. One of the main factors working in the EU™s favour is the price of oil, which 
remains exceptionally low, even after 
having bounced back since the winter. 
A cyclical upswing is 
underway favoured 

by several temporary 
tailwinds – 
–whose strength 
underpins an upward 

revision to the growth 
forecast this year –

  European Economic Forecast, Spring 2015 
  2 At the same time, the effective exchange
 rate of the euro has continued to 
fall, boosting firms™ competitiveness and profit margins. 
Financial markets and asset prices are also benefiting by more than expected 
from the substantial liquidity being created by the ECB™s expanded asset 

purchase programme (APP). The ECB™s QE
 has prevented an increase in real 
interest rates by re-anchoring inflation expectations. This in turn is likely to 

make the impact of low oil prices on domestic demand larger than it would 

otherwise have been and to further facilitate deleveraging in the euro area. 

Moreover, easier financing conditions should support lending, confidence, 

investment and ultimately economic growth. Outside the euro area, several 
European central banks have also acted 
to ease monetary conditions further.  
These tailwinds, combined with the broa
dly neutral fiscal stance of the euro 
area and the EU as a whole, enhance GD
P growth this year and next, even 
though underlying weaknesses and legacies from the crisis remain. 
Stronger economic growth should lead to further improvements in labour 
market conditions, which in turn should feed private consumption. Higher 

demand and a somewhat lower need for balance-sheet adjustment, should 

support investment and thereby help th
e economic recovery to become more 
sustainable. Whether the pace of economic activity growth can be sustained 

beyond this short term outlook, however, will depend on potential growth and 
thus on a sustained rebound in investment. Structural reforms implemented 

so far are starting to bear fruit in some Member States but overall remain 

insufficient to definitively overcome legacies of the crisis and significantly 
increase medium-term growth potentials. 
The outlook for economic growth around the world is uneven. Income 
transfers from oil producers to oil consumers, monetary policy easing in 

several places and exchange rate moveme
nts contribute to this differentiated 
outlook. 
Pushed by the gradual recovery in 
advanced economies, global growth 
(excluding the EU) is expected to stabilise at 3.8% this year and pick up 

moderately to 4.3% in 2016, just a notch lower than expected in the winter. 

Despite the weather-related weakness at the start of the year, the robust 

momentum of economic growth in the US is expected to strengthen 

throughout 2015, as private consumption is boosted by a strong labour 

market and real income gains stemming from low oil prices and the strong 

dollar, although the US currency™s stre
ngth will likely act as a drag on net 
exports and activity going forward. After having stagnated last year, 

economic activity in Japan is exp
ected to rebound in 2015 and 2016, 
triggered by accommodative monetary policy and low oil prices. 
Growth in emerging markets economies (E
MEs) is expected to remain steady 
overall in 2015 and to pick up a little in 2016. The improved outlook for 

India contrasts with weaker prospects for many other EMEs on the back of 

geopolitical tensions, lower prices for commodity exports and the incidence 

of some structural domestic bottlenecks and imbalances. In China, GDP 

growth appears to be slowing in a remarkably controlled manner towards the 

authorities™ target of 7% following their deliberate strategy to rebalance 
growth. 
–while structural and 
crisis-related 

weaknesses still affect 

the medium-term 
outlook. 
Global growth is set to 
accelerate only 
moderately – 
Overview 
  3 The momentum of world trade weakened at
 the turn of the year as imports in 
EMEs were particularly weak (mainly in Russia and oil exporting countries), 

but world trade is expected to accel
erate moderately, triggered by the 
expansion of the global economy, and will underpin an acceleration of EU 
Member States™ export markets over the forecast horizon. 
Expectations about a divergence in m
onetary policy between the euro area 
and other large economies, itself driven by delayed recovery in the former, 

have become a key factor for foreign exchange rates. The euro has 

experienced large swings vis-à-vis some other major currencies since the 

beginning of this year. While the euro has weakened substantially against the 

US dollar and the pound sterling, it has experienced more limited movements 

against most other EU currencies in
 the context of acco
mmodative monetary 
policy actions taken by several central banks in the EU. 
Financial conditions in the euro ar
ea have eased since November, when 
expectations about QE became stronger. These movements continued after 

the announcement of the expanded 
APP in January 2015 and its actual 
implementation in March. The effects of these non-standard monetary policy 
tools on financial markets have been even stronger than expected. Euro area 

sovereign bond yields have been driven down significantly and sovereign 

yield curves, which constitute a benchmar
k for the pricing of a vast array of 
credit instruments and forms of external
 finance for the private sector, have 
flattened. Supported also by more positive news on economic activity, stock 

markets across the EU have firmed stro
ngly since the star
t of the year and 
corporate bond spreads have tightened, lowering financing costs for 
European companies. 
Bank lending to the private sector c
ontinues to recover, with net lending 
flows to non-financial corporations 
becoming gradually less negative and 
credit standards on loans to enterpri
ses easing further. The ECB™s expanded 
APP is expected to add some further momentum by improving the liquidity 

position of banks. Last year™s asset quality review showed that banks are, 

overall, better capitalised than during the crisis and hence, in a better position 

to withstand losses on outstanding loans to the private sector. However, in 

some Member States, relatively low capital buffers and high levels of non-

performing loans may impair the transm
ission of the ECB™s QE into bank 
lending. 
All countries in the EU are set to bene
fit from a rare conjunction of positive 
factors, but not necessarily to the 
same degree. Differences in the pass-
through of lower oil prices and, in th
e euro area, a varying effect of the 
depreciation of the euro according to 
the price elasticity of exports and the 
openness to trade with non-euro area 
countries will modulate their impact. 
Transmission channels for QE, other than 
the exchange rate, are also likely to 
differ across countries. The decline in real interest rates should, for instance, 

be larger in peripheral countries that had wider spreads before QE was 

announced. On the other hand, in some peripheral countries, the fragility of 

financial systems and the high level of non-performing loans may hinder the 
conversion of extra liquidity into more lending to the private sector. 
Among the largest Member States, GDP growth is expected to be above the 
EU average in Poland, Spain and the UK. Economic activity should stay 

robust in 
Poland
 on the back of solid domestic demand. In 
Spain
, the recovery is accelerating this year, supported by improved labour market and 

financing conditions, although a moderation in growth is expected next year.

activity in EU Member 

States to a different 
degree – European Economic Forecast, Spring 2015 
  4 Growth in the 
UK is expected to remain robust but to slow this year and next 
as investment growth cools. In 
Germany
, economic growth is expected to be 
driven by exceptionally robust domestic demand with private consumption 

underpinned by an improving labour market. Economic activity in 
France is 
expected to slowly gain momentum thanks to private consumption, but the 

delay in the recovery of investment is keeping GDP growth below the euro 

area average. 
Italy™s economy is expected to return to growth this year, 
thanks to increasing external demand, and to strengthen next year once 

investment picks up. Although short-term deleveraging pressures are 

expected to abate in 
the Netherlands
, they will continue to limit the potential 
for a faster recovery
. Among the euro area Member States that have, or have had, adjustment 
programmes, growth is expect
ed to remain robust in 
Ireland
 but to turn 
positive only next year in 
Cyprus
. Economic growth is gathering momentum 
in 
Portugal 
thanks to improved domestic demand and strong exports. In 
Greece, policy uncertainty has already weak
ened confidence and is affecting 
the pace of the incipient recovery. 
Domestic demand is expected to acceler
ate over the forecast horizon and to 
remain the main contributor to GDP growth in the EU and the euro area. This 

mainly reflects the expansion of private consumption expected this year and a 
rebound of investment next year. 
Although some crisis-related factors 
continue to weigh on investment, 
particularly in the euro area, investment 
is forecast to sligh
tly strengthen this 
year and to resurge more strongly in 2016. Equipment investment should gain 

traction supported by stronger domestic and external demand, improved 

business sentiment, wider profit margins due to lower energy prices, and 

lower funding costs. The capacity of companies to fund themselves with 

internal resources should strengthen thanks to the accumulation of significant 

cash positions and growing gross operatin
g surpluses, while external funding 
costs should fall, thanks to the relaxation in lending condition and the 

decrease in real longer-term interest 
rates underpinned by the ECB™s QE. By 
reducing the funding costs of investment projects and improving investment 

conditions, the Investment Plan for Europe should have a positive impact on 

equipment and construction investment both in the public and private sectors 

in the coming years. Lower mortgage rates and easing financing conditions 

are set to lift residential construction, but ongoing adjustments in the housing 

market are likely to continue acting as 
a drag in several countries, albeit to a 
lesser extent in 2016 than in 2015. 
Enhanced by the rise in nominal compensation being driven by slight 
improvements in labour market conditions and strong growth in non-labour 

incomes, households™ nominal disposable incomes should register a marked 

rise. At the same time, the very low rate of inflation will translate into strong 

increases in real disposable incomes. Household's more favourable financial 

situation and more favourable financing conditions should impact positively 

on household spending decisions. A slight increase in their saving ratio is 

nevertheless projected this year, sin
ce households are expected to save a 
portion of the energy price windfall in an attempt to smoothen inter-temporal 

consumption. As oil prices are assumed to rebound gradually, the large 

purchasing power lift to households should slowly fade next year, cooling 

private consumption. However, with deleveraging needs diminishing, 

consumer confidence picking up and unemployment declining further, the 
–but will broadly 
support domestic 
demand – Overview 
  5 saving ratio should stop increasing in 2016, and private consumption growth 
should only slightly decelerate. 
Helped by stronger global import demand and the euro™s depreciation (about 
9% in nominal effective terms in 2015 compared to 2014), EU exports should 

accelerate this year and next. However,
 increased price competitiveness due 
to the euro™s depreciation is expected to translate only partly into higher sales 

volumes. Indeed, euro area exporters, as
 well as firms that compete with 
importers in the domestic market, are 
expected to also restore their profit 
margins. Still, countries that have implemented structural reforms are 

expected to see an improvement in thei
r export performance. In line with the 
strengthening in domestic and external demand, imports of goods and 

services are set to accelerate over the fo
recast horizon. Overall, net exports 
should have an almost neutral impact on GDP growth in both areas and both 
years. Inflation in the EU and the euro ar
ea fell in late 2014 and early 2015, 
dropping below zero in December on account of the continued sharp fall in 

energy prices. Despite th
e recent rebound 
in oil prices, which has been 
stronger in euro terms, inflation is expected to be negative for the first half of 

this year, partly due to negative base 
effects from the earlier fall of the HICP 
energy component. Later this year, and 
more noticeably in 2016, the expected 
strengthening of domestic demand, combined with a narrowing of the output 

gap, fading effects of lower commodity prices and progressively higher 

import prices triggered by the depreciation of the euro, should result in 

gradually higher inflation rates. Inflation expectations, which recovered when 

the ECB announced its expanded APP, signal low but positive inflation in the 

next few years. Annual HICP inflatio
n in both the EU and the euro area is 
expected to rise from 0.1
% this year to 1.5
% next year. 
The fiscal outlook is improving. The deficitŒto-GDP ratio in the EU and the 
euro area is estimated to have decreas
ed to 2.9% and 2.4% respectively in 
2014. In the euro 
area, the non-standard monetary policy measures taken by 
the ECB are expected to have some positive impact on the fiscal outlook 

through the decline in borrowing costs and the higher inflation outlook. 

Supported by the cyclical strengthening of economic activity and to a lesser 
extent by the further reduction in interest payments on public debt, 

government deficit ratios are projected to continue falling over this year and 

next to reach 2.0% of GDP in the EU and 1.7% in the euro area in 2016. 

Following the substantial fiscal adjustme
nt achieved over the last few years, 
the aggregated fiscal policy stance in 
2014 and 2015 in the EU and the euro 
area is expected to be broadly neutral. The debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to 

have peaked at 88.6% in the EU and at 
94.2% in the euro ar
ea in 2014, and is 
expected to decline this year and even
 more so next year, as nominal GDP 
growth picks up. 
The recovery of the labour market in the EU is progressing and is becoming 
fairly broad-based across sectors. Ther
e are also some signs of convergence 
among Member States, as employment growth last year was driven to a large 

extent by improvements in countries with relatively high unemployment 
rates. Looking ahead, with economic growth expected to strengthen in 2015 

and 2016 and wage increases to remain moderate, modest improvements in 

the labour market are set to continue. Employment is expected to grow in 

both areas by 0.9
% this year and by 1% in the 
EU and 1.1% in the euro area 
next year. The recovery in employment is expected to be relatively strong in 

countries that recen
tly implemented labour market
 reforms (e.g. Spain). The 
–while the lower euro 
is an opportunity for 

exporters to restore 
their profit margins – 
–and will also help 
normalise inflation. 
The fiscal outlook is 
improving and the 

aggregated stance 

will be broadly 
neutral – 
–while progress in the 
labour market is 
gradually broadening. 
European Economic Forecast, Spring 2015 
  6 unemployment rate is projected to decline somewhat to 9.2% in the EU and 
10.5% in the euro area in 2016, reflecti
ng the persistence of high structural 
unemployment and large unemployment gaps, as the rise in economic 
activity is not strong enough for a more marked improvement. 
Overall, the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook remains high, but 
risks to the upside and those to 
the downside are broadly balanced. 
On the upside, new developments in oil production could delay the assumed 
rebound in oil prices and keep the oil-price stimulus in the EU intact for 
longer than expected
. The boost from lower oil prices could also be stronger 
than currently expected. The impact of
 the ECB™s QE could be larger than 
forecast if companies™ decisions in 
the euro area are more interest-rate 
sensitive than assumed and bank lending reacts more strongly than projected, 

or if the implementation of QE depresses the external value of the euro 

beyond the technical assumption in this forecast. Finally, pending the 

finalisation of the on-going discussion on the Investmen Plan for Europe, 

only a cautious estimate of its impact has 
been retained in this forecast. This 
may underestimate the positive impact on 
total investment growth in the EU 
and in particular countries. 
On the downside, geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and parts of the Middle 
East and Northern Africa remain high and could further impede economic 

growth in Europe if they escalate. If oil production adjusts faster than 

expected to low prices, oil prices co
uld rebound faster than assumed and 
erase the windfall gains from lower energy prices. Renewed bouts of 

financial market volatility associated with the expected normalisation of 

monetary policy in the US, or with a correction in asset values, or stemming 

from developments related to Gree
ce, could jeopardise the expected 
improvements in financing costs. Finally, a delay in the implementation of 

structural reforms would make the rotation of growth drivers from temporary 

tailwinds towards fundamentally more sound growth determinants more 

difficult and raise the risk of a long period of very subdued economic growth 
or stagnation. 
Risks surrounding the inflation outlook have moderated as a result of the 
ECB™s quantitative easing and in response to the upward revisions to the 

growth outlook. This applies in particular to the risk of a substantial decline 

of longer-term inflation expectations and of negative second-round effects on 
income stemming from a protracted period of very low or negative inflation. 
Uncertainty is high but 
risks are broadly 
balanced 
PART I EA and EU outlook 
  TAILWINDS SUPPORTING THE RECOVERY    9 In spring 2015 the outlook for the EU economy looks brighter than it has at any time since the deep 
economic and financial crisis of 2008-09. The recovery from the crisis and the double-dip recession has 

been a long and tedious one, marked by numerous setbacks, but now there are clear indications that a 

cyclical upswing is underway, supported by economic tailwinds. These tailwinds include low oil prices, 

a lower external value of the eu
ro, and increased policy support, including the ECB™s non-standard 
monetary policy measures (quantitative easing) with their strong liquidity injections and the fall in 

interest rates. Furthermore, over 
the forecast horizon the structural reforms implemented so far (such as 
labour market reforms in vulnerable countries) should bear fruit. On the downside, some obstacles for 

stronger economic growth (crisis legacy) remain in place but with diminishing weight.  
Stronger tailwinds, mainly driving private consumpt
ion, result in an upward revision to the growth 
forecast for this year. Next year, tailwinds shou
ld remain strong enough to mitigate the impact of a 
slightly weaker global growth outlook than earlier expected, less dynamic global trade, and a stronger 

rebound in oil prices, which keeps the growth foreca
st unchanged. Real GDP growth is now expected to 
increase in the euro area and in the EU to 1.5% and 1.8% respectively in 2015 and further to 1.9% and 

2.1% in 2016, which implies an upward revision in 2015 from the winter forecast by 0.2 pps. in the euro 

area and 0.1 pps. in the EU. As a result, economic 
output in both regions is
 now expected to exceed its 
pre-crisis peaks in 2016. 
Labour market conditions should c
ontinue improving against the ba
ckground of accelerating economic 
activity in the forecast years.  
Although inflation dynamics weaken
ed in recent months, dragging in
flation below zero, HICP inflation 
is expected to rise from an averag
e annual rate of 0.1% this year to 1.5% in both the euro area and the 
EU in 2016, as the impact of the fall in oil prices 
fades, economic slack diminishes, and the depreciation 
of the euro raises import prices. 
Risks to the growth outlook remain elevated but appear to be broadly balanced. Some previously 
discussed risks have partly materialised and entered the main scenario (faster and larger-than-assumed 

rebound in oil prices) or appear to have diminished (de-anchoring inflation expectations). Risks to the 

inflation outlook have declined in response to the ECB™s non-standard monetary policy and appear to 

be balanced.

 European Economic Forecast, Spring 2015 
  10 1. PUTTING THE SPRING FORECAST INTO 
PERSPECTIVE: THE ECB™S QUANTITATIVE 

EASING AND THE EURO AREA ECONOMY In spring 2015, the econom
ic recovery in the euro 
area is underpinned by a number of factors that 

include low oil prices, the 
depreciation of the euro, 
and non-standard monetary policy in the euro area. 

All these factors are interrelated, but they affect 

the forecast differently. Wh
ile the impact of oil 
prices and exchange rates 
was analysed in greater 
detail in the winter forecast, 
(1) this section looks at 
the impact of non-standard monetary policy on the 

macroeconomic outlook. 
While in normal times, monetary policy enters 
macroeconomic forecasts 
through assumptions on 
short and long-term (nominal) interest rates, it is 

not straightforward how non-standard tools (e.g. 

forward rate guidance and asset purchases) enter 

the forecast. 
(2)
 It therefore seems useful to take a 
closer look at the main transmission channels of 

monetary policy and potential cross-country 

differences to gauge the 
impact on the outlook for 
economic growth and inflation. 
Quantitative easing (QE) in the euro area... Over a number of years, inflationary pressures in 

the global economy have diminished and inflation 

expectations have fallen. The recent sharp drop in 

oil prices had accentuated the decline and 

increased the risk of a prolonged period of falling 

prices. In the euro area, by late 2014, not only 

headline inflation and inflation expectations had 

been on a downward trend for two years. So too 

had forecasts, including for the current year (see 

Graph I.3). Weaker inflation dynamics had begun 

to affect inflation expectations not only in the short 

term, but also for longer horizons. 
As short-term nominal interest rates had already 
fallen close to the zero lower bound, on 22 January 

2015 the ECB Governing Council decided to 

extend the use of non-standard tools, 
(3)
 which so

Jackson Hole in August 2014 as the trigger for QE; see e.g. 
IMF, Navigating Monetary Policy Challenges and 
far had mainly addressed market dysfunctions as 
well as impaired monetary policy transmission 

channels. (4)
 The ECB launched an expanded asset 
purchase programme (APP), encompassing the 

existing purchase programmes for asset-backed 

securities and covered bonds, as well as purchases 

of euro-denominated investment-grade securities 

issued by euro area governments, agencies and 

European institutions in the secondary market. The 

amount of monthly purchases under the APP was 

set at •60 billion. Purchases are intended to be 

continued until at least the end of September 2016 

or until the identification of a sustained adjustment 

in the path of inflation, consistent with price 

stability.

 In commencing large-scale asset purchases on 9 
March 2015, the ECB became the last major 

central bank to adopt ‚quantitative easing™ (QE) 

after central banks in th
e US (2008-14), the UK 
(2009-12) and Japan (since 2001 in various 

formats), which had increasingly turned to the 

strategy in response to the 2008-09 crisis. Up to 

September 2016, in the euro area QE should 

amount to roughly 12% of annual GDP, making it 

about half the size of th
e QE programmes followed 
in the UK and the US. What differs substantially is 

the starting position for QE in the euro area. 

Whereas in the US, the deep fall in economic

EA and EU outlook 
  11 activity triggered policy action, in the euro area, 
the economic recovery had already been underway 

for more than a year while inflation expectations 

had fallen substantially. While in the US and the 

UK, QE started from relatively high interest rate 

levels and was accompanied by cuts in policy 

interest rates; in the euro area, interest rates of 

different maturity had already reached historical 

lows when the measures were taken. 
–has started affecting the economy via a 
number of channels. The impact of both 
the announcement and 
implementation of QE depends on a number of 

transmission channels. The main channels are the 

portfolio balance channel, the signalling channel, 

and the confidence (or 
uncertainty) channel. 
(6)
 Although these channels are the same as in other 

jurisdictions, their relative importance in the euro 

area is different because of specific characteristics, 

such as the lower dependence of non-financial 

companies on market financing. In addition, 

analysts have described several other channels 

(e.g. exchange rate, wealth, and fiscal channel), but 

most of them are closely linked to the three main 

channels and describe specific elements therein.  
Through the portfolio balance channel... The ECB™s purchases of government debt lower 

yields at the maturities purchased through the 

compression of term premia (term premium 

channel). (7)
 Since sovereign yields are important 
for a large variety of other financial assets and 

contracts, QE triggers 
price effects, but also 
quantity effects, as private investors use the 

additional liquidity to rebalance their portfolios 

(portfolio balance channel
). Arbitrage affects the 
returns on similar assets as investors attempt to 

buy these instead. Falling returns should induce 

some investors to switch to riskier assets with the 

rebalancing depending on the substitutability of the 

assets that are purchased by the central bank. In the 

current low-interest rate environment, the type of 

assets purchased by the ECB and cash and bank 

deposits are close substitutes. Nevertheless, there 

should be a portfolio reallocation towards equity 

and foreign-currency assets, which increases the

 and also the price of foreign currency (

market value of sovereign bonds affects the 

financing conditions of governments (
fiscal 
channel). ...QE lowers financing costs and encourages 
bank lending... In the euro area, higher asset prices and lower 
interest rates have lowered borrowing costs in 

capital markets and ther
eby supported bank 
lending, as banks had more funds available. In the 

April 2015 Bank Lending Survey, almost half of 

the banks assessed their financing conditions as 

having improved in the past six months as a result 

of QE and almost the same
 share expected further 
improvements over the next six months. Many of 

them described their liquidity position as 

improved, driven by their sales of assets and by 

increased deposits from households and 

enterprises. The additional liquidity resulted in an 

easing of credit standards in the past and was 

expected to lead to further easing in the coming 

months (see Graph I.4).

 The impact of QE on bank lending is particularly 
important in a bank-centred lending environment 

such as the euro area
. But the market-based 
funding of enterprises is also positively affected by 

QE. Higher stock prices should directly reduce the 

financing costs of firms and, by dampening the 

required return on capital, induce higher 

investment. However, 
the spread between 
sovereign and investment grade corporate bond 

yields was also at very low levels before the ECB 

announced QE and has since fallen further. 
Moreover, the impact on gross fixed capital 
formation (investment) depends on its interest rate 

elasticity. The fact that investment activity has 

been weak in recent year
s despite relatively low 
financing costs suggests th
at the elasticity could be 
rather low. To the extent that weak investment is 

related to low expectations of future demand, the 

projected pick-up of activity should lead to a 
recovery of investment. However, since the crisis, 
deleveraging in the private sector has been a key 

reason for the subdued rate of credit expansion. 

This factor remains 
in place though with 
diminishing weight for investment decisions. 
As regards asset holders, higher prices of financial 
assets raise their financial wealth (
wealth channel
). 
This should induce households to reduce 

precautionary savings and to raise consumption 

spending, but the effects are likely to be limited 

given that wealth effects in the euro area generally 

are rather small. Increased financial wealth could 

also affect companies, which could raise 

investment and take more risk. Increased asset 

values should also tend to improve the health of 

balance sheets. In the case of financial institutions, 

higher asset prices can 
support recapitalisation. 
The counterpart to these effects could be increased 

risks for institutions that usually exploit the slope 

of the yield curve (banks
 with a large role of 
maturity transformation in their business models) 

and financial corporates that have guaranteed pay-

outs on their liabilities such as European life 

insurance companies. 
(9) Additional risks are 
associated with interest rates turning negative and 

remaining at such levels fo
r a protracted period. In 
such a situation, borrowers could be expected to 

build up excessive leverage, with possible 

implications in particular for housing markets. 
–while it supports the depreciation of the euro. The recent depreciation 
of the euro cannot be 
attributed exclusively to QE, as monetary policy 

decisions in other jurisdictions have also 

strengthened ‚monetary divergence™. In particular 

the future path of the eu
ro exchange rate should 
depend on the timing of monetary policy 

‚normalisation™ in the US 
(10)
 and its impact on 
interest rate expectations (Graph I.7). This might 

suggest that the exchange rate channel should be 

especially powerful dur
ing the forecast years. (11)
 The depreciation of the euro should have a direct 

positive effect on inflation and an indirect effect by 

                                                          
 (9) See also IMF, 
Global Financial Stability Report
, April 
2015, pp. 22Œ24. 
(10) Historical evidence of the link between QE and a 
depreciation of the currency is mixed, see e.g. C.J. Neely, 
‚Unconventional monetary polic
y had large international 
effects™, 
Journal of Banking & Finance
, March 2015, Vol. 
52, pp. 101Œ111. 
(11) Due to the technical assumption for exchange rates, no 
further exchange rates movements after the cut-off date are 

included in the spring forecast, which implies that a further 
depreciation of the euro should be seen as an upside risk to 
the central scenario. 
EA and EU outlook 
  13 raising price competitiveness vis-à-vis companies 
in non-euro area economies (such exports make up 

about 20% of the euro ar
ea GDP). Increased price 
competitiveness affects foreign markets (via 

exports) and the domestic market (via competition 

with imports from outside the euro area). 

Companies could raise profit margins or aim to 

increase their market share.
 The impact on export 
volumes depends on openness, trade structure, and 

the price elasticity of trade flows.

 The aforementioned effects should raise inflation 
expectations and thereby lower real interest rates, 

which should counteract an unwarranted tightening 

of financial conditions. 
The ECB™s QE could also affect economic activity 
and monetary policy outside the euro area, as 

experiences from other jurisdictions hint at 

spillovers. 
(12)
 The removal of the cap on the 
exchange rate of the Swiss franc, one week before 

the announcement of QE details, was closely 

linked to developments in the euro area. Some 

central banks in non-euro area Member States also 

saw a need to respond (see Section I.3). 
QE flattens the yield curve via the signalling 
channel– The ECB™s asset purchases are a strong signal that 
the policy interest rate will be kept close to the 

effective lower bound for some time (
signalling 
channel). 
(13)
 This channel, which had already

become effective with th
e extension of forward 
guidance in 2013, was strengthened by the 

announcement of the APP in January 2015, which 

lowered the expected average short-term interest 

rate and thereby the long-term rate via the 

expectations hypothesis. As a result, the yield 

curve of AAA-rated sovereign bonds has flattened 

in the euro area (Graph I.8). 
(14) This has important 
implications because the curve constitutes a 

benchmark for the pricing a vast array of credit 

instruments and forms of external finance for the 

private sector, for example bank loans, corporate 

loans and equity.

 –and exerts positive effects via the 
confidence channel. By conducting QE, the ECB™s Governing Council 
also reassured households and companies of its 

determination to use all available tools within its 

mandate to address the risks of a prolonged period 

of low inflation. As a result, not only financial 

market uncertainty but also general economic 

uncertainty has diminished as upward movements 

of confidence indicators suggest (

spending and investment by households and

  14 suggest that there are likely to be significant 
differences across countries. The 
differentiated 
impact of the euro™s depreciation
 is the most 
obvious example of a coun
try-specific impact of 
QE. Countries with price-sensitive exports can be 

expected to see a str
onger impact. Germany™s 
exports are found to have a relatively low price 

elasticity, whereas for expo
rts from Italy and Spain 
they are estimated to be higher, 
(15)
 which could 
suggest support for intra-
euro area rebalancing. 
Moreover, the openness to trade with non-euro 

area countries is crucial (see Table I.57 in the 

Statistical Annex). In terms of export-market 

growth and bilateral excha
nge rates, countries with 
strong trade links to the US (e.g. Ireland, Germany 

and Italy) should benefit more than those which 

trade more with Russia, such as the Baltic 

countries and Finland. 
The decline in nominal and real interest rates
 should be larger in countries that had wider spread 

vis-à-vis the benchmark before QE was 

announced. This could apply to nominal yields 

(see Graph I.9) and to real yields. This could 

suggest that peripheral Member States that have 

been under market pressure during the crisis might 

now benefit more from QE through the effects on 

real interest rates and the real value of their debt.

 The bank lending channel has been particularly 
distorted in countries of the euro area™s periphery, 

where aspects other than yields may still matter 

more (e.g. capitalisation of banks). This could

lending
 (see also Box I.2). Analyses of previous 
central bank balance sheet shocks in the euro area 

found a stronger impact 
in countries that are 
generally less affected by the financial crisis. 
(16)
 For instance, non-performing loans (NPL) are 

unevenly distributed in the euro area. In six euro 

area countries (Cyprus, 
Greece, Italy, Portugal, 
Slovenia, Ireland) NPLs take up 10% or more of 

banks™ balance sheets, according to the ECB™s 

Asset Quality Review. Many banks in peripheral 

countries had not been able to convert extra 

liquidity into more lending to the private sector 

because of their financial fragility and low 

capitalisation. There has been a positive 

correlation between bank capital and the rise in 

bank lending to households and firms after an 

expansion in the ECB™s balance sheet, in particular 

with respect to lending to non-financial 

corporations. Moreover, disintermediation can be 

expected to differ regionally, depending on the 

structure of the private sect
or, particularly in terms 
of the weight of SMEs and large non-financial 

corporates. –the positive overall impact on economic 
activity and inflation should be sizeable. It is too soon for a full assessment of the overall 
impact of the ECB™s QE. Up to the cut-off date of 

the spring forecast, several of the aforementioned 

transmission channels appear
 to be already at work 
in the euro area, impacting on euro area banks, 
(17)
 on financial markets (see Section I.3), and on 

economic activity. Quantifying the impact is rather 

difficult due to the need to
 disentangle QE-induced 
effects from other causes of fluctuations in 

financial and real variables and results from 

empirical research on QE are mixed (see Box I.2).  
Almost all empirical studies confirm a QE-induced 
reduction in long-term interest rates, but the 

magnitude of the effects differs widely across 

studies. 
(18)
 Accordingly, empiri
cal studies on the 
impact of QE on inflation and economic activity 

provide a variety of results for the US, the UK, and 

                                                          
 (16) Boecks, Dossche and Peersman (2014) found the effects of 
a central bank balance-sheet shock on output to be 
relatively large in DE, FI, EE, IE, SI, SK and LU; much 

more subdued in FR, IT, AT and BE, and negligible in ES, 
NL, PT and CY; see J. Boeckx, M. Dossche and G.

(20)
 For the US and 
the UK, evidence has been presented that suggests 

that QE results in a depreciation of the domestic 

currency similar to the 
one induced by standard 
monetary policy measures. 
(21)
 However, no 
significant impact on the 
currency has been found 
in Japan in the first years of QE. 
(22)
 Overall, QE is expected to have a positive impact 
on inflation and economic activity over the 

forecast horizon. The substantial size of the ECB™s 

programme suggests that the effects on real GDP 

growth and HICP inflation will be sizeable this 

year and next. While ther
e is already evidence of 
the impact in the short run, towards the end of the 

forecast horizon the impact
 could also depend on 
the way in which monetary policy normalisation is 

signalled once the asset purchase programme is 

assessed as having been successful.

Chung et al. (2011) claim that the first two rounds of QE 
increased real GDP by 3% and inflation by 1 pp., whereas 

Chen et al. (2012) use a DSGE model and find that QE2 
increased GDP growth by less than 
 pps. and that the 
effect on inflation was close to zero. See H. Chung, J.-P.

2. THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT 
Following a slight slowdown in the fourth quarter 
of 2014, global growth and world trade are 

expected to strengthen modestly. While growth in 

emerging markets is expected to remain steady in 

2015 and to pick up a little in 2016, the gradual 

recovery in advanced economies should push 

global activity in 2015 and 2016.  
Global economic growth is expected to 
accelerate in 2015-16– In 2014-Q4, the global economy slowed 
marginally, after two quarters of rapid growth. It 

weakened to 0.8% q-o-q (from 1.0% in 2014-Q2 

and 1.1% in 2014-Q3)
. This slackening pace 
mainly reflected some deceleration in the US and 

Canada, although there was also a slower fourth 

quarter in some of the largest emerging markets 

(China and India). In 2014
 as a whole, the global 
economy (excluding the EU) is expected to have 

grown by 3.8%, compared to 4.0% in 2013.

All in all, global growth (excluding the EU) is 
expected to accelerate to 3.
8% in 2015 and 4.3% in 
2016, almost unchanged fr
om the winter forecast. 
European Economic Forecast, Spring 2015 
  16 –with pronounced differences across and 
within regions– Among advanced economies, growth momentum 
in the US remains robust. The US economy saw a 

slower fourth quarter in 2014 as the stronger dollar 

weighed on export, and activity was also held back 

in early 2015 by adverse weather conditions. But 

growth is expected to strengthen over the course of 

2015, driven mainly by private consumption, 

underpinned by a strong labour market and real 

income gains in a low inflation environment. The 

outlook is nevertheless less buoyant than before, 

with oil prices recovering from their January 2015 

lows and the stronger dollar likely to act as a drag 

on net exports. 
In Japan, pronounced weakness in mid-2014 and 
weaker-than-expected growth
 in the fourth quarter 
brought yearly growth to zero. Underpinned by 

accommodative monetary policy and the impact of 

lower oil prices, economic activity is expected to 

rebound in 2015 and 2016. All in all, economic 

growth in advanced economies is expected to 

accelerate from 1.8% in 2014
 to 2.3% in 2015 and 
2.5% in 2016.  
Emerging markets are expected to grow by 4.4% 
in 2015 and to pick up to 5.0% in 2016. The 

outlook is little changed in aggregate terms relative 

to the winter forecast, t
hough there has been some 
worsening of the prospects for EU candidate 

countries, the MENA region and Sub Saharan 
Africa, largely reflecting exposure to geopolitical 
tensions and commodity price shifts. The outlook 

for Latin America too has worsened in 2015 as a 

result of commodity price developments and 

tightening monetary conditions, but the outlook for 

2016 looks more positive and is almost unchanged. 

In India sharp upward revisions to historical data 

and the outlook are largel
y due to methodological 
revisions in the country™s national accounts data 

(e.g. shifting the base year, switching to GDP at 

market prices from factor
 cost, incorporating more 
detailed data). In China, economic growth of 

around 7% is expected in 2015 and 2016. Recent 

high frequency data point to renewed weakness in 

domestic demand, however, this is likely to lead to 

further policy responses from the government to 

keep growth within range of its target of 7%.  
–underpinned by stronger growth in world 
trade– The momentum of world trade weakened at the 
turn of the year (see Gr
aph I.11), with weaker 
imports by emerging economies, mainly in Asia, 

overshadowing some moderate improvement in 

advanced economies, primarily the euro area and 

Japan. According to the world trade volume 

indicator of the Netherlands Bureau for Economic 

Policy Analysis (CPB), trade momentum (three 

months on three months) slowed to 0.6% in 

January, its lowest in seven months and 

significantly down from 2.0% in November 2014.

  EA and EU outlook 
  17 In 2015 and 2016, a gradual rebound in world 
trade is expected with trade growth rising from 

2.6% in 2014 to 3.8% and 5.1% in 2015 and 2016. 

Compared to the winter fo
recast, the strength of 
the rebound has been revised down by 0.5 pps. and 

0.2 pps. respectively, refl
ecting cyclical factors, 
such as the weakness in equipment investment, and 

structural factors that 
determine the long-term 
relationship of economic growth and global 

trade. (24)
 In terms of the regional composition, 
downward revisions were relatively minor among 

advanced economies (mainly the US), but larger 

among emerging markets, where the 

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the 

Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA), Latin 

America and some Asian economies were affected.

 –and a gradual rebound in oil prices– Oil prices have recovered from the lows of 
January, but the bounce back has been limited, and 

uncertainty around the course of oil prices remains 

high due to the large number of factors that could 

exert upward or downward
 pressures (e.g. changes 
in the global outlook, supply disruptions, supply 

extensions by several producers, OPEC policy). 
Oil market developments have been dominated by 
the sharp decline in pri
ces between mid-2014 and

(25) After falling below 50 USD/bbl 
in mid-January, oil spot prices rebounded to some 

USD 60/bbl in February (see Graph I.12). This 

development was supported by the market™s 

expectation that US rig counts would decline and 

the perception that US ec
onomic data was rather 
positive. But in March, ma
rket participants became 
increasingly sceptical that 
the sharp drop in US oil-
targeted drilling activity would curb shale 

production, which has substantially grown in 

recent years. Moreover
, progress in the 
negotiations between Iran and a group of 

permanent members of the UN Security Council 

and Germany (P5+1) on the use of nuclear energy 

created expectations of 
a future increase of oil 
supply from Iran. These factors exerted downward 

pressure on crude oil prices.

 Compared to the winter forecast, the assumptions 
for Brent prices have been revised upwards to 

USD 59.4/bbl in 2015 and to USD 66.0/bbl in 

2016. Uncertainty around 
this technical projection 
for the oil price remains high in the short and 

medium run, due to geopolitical tensions, possible 

changes in OPEC strategy and the break-even 

price for different oil pro
ducers. In euro terms the 
oil price assumption has been revised up by 21% 

in 2015 and 17% in 2016. 
The assumption for most other commodity markets 
is that prices will continue to fall in 2015-16. 

Metal prices fell on average by 11% in 2014, 

owing to less dynamic industrial performance in 

China, the world™s largest metals market, and 

ample stockpiles of most metals. Most metal prices 

continued to decline in the first quarter of 2015,

  18 hence the outlook for metal prices is negative for 
2015. 
With the exception of a few products, the prices of 
most agricultural commodities were on a 

downward trend in 2014. Owing to a comfortable 

production outlook, most food prices, notably 

soybeans and main cereals, 
are projected 
to decline 
further in 2015 before stabilising somewhat in 

2016. 
–with the global outlook subject to a number 
of related key risks. Differences in the pace of recovery among 
advanced economies raise the prospect of 

divergent trends in monetary policy with some risk 

of abrupt adjustment in exchange rates and greater 

financial market volatility if weaker growth 

persists in the EU and Japan while monetary policy 

in the US is gradually normalised. Financial 

market turbulence linked to the normalisation of 

US rates also remains a risk factor for the more 

vulnerable emerging market economies.  
Although GDP growth in China appears to be 
slowing in a remarkably controlled manner, the 

credit and debt overhang from recent years 

continues to raise concerns about financial 

stability, particularly given the weakness of the 

property market. Recent hi
gh frequency data are 
following a recurrent pattern of early-year 

weakness with growth picking up in the remainder 

of the year. But a sharper-than-expected 

adjustment cannot be ruled out.  
Although there is substan
tial uncertainty about the 
path of future oil prices, the positive impact of 

lower oil prices on global growth may turn out to 

be stronger than curren
tly anticipated because 
supply-side factors may have played a larger role 

for the decline than initially assumed. 
Geopolitical factors play a major role in the supply 
side of the oil market as a source of both upside 

and downside risk to the oil price and thereby to 

the global growth outlook. Geopolitical risks also 

remain elevated in the 
Russia/Ukraine context, 
where performance has already deteriorated 

sharply, and further volatility cannot be 

discounted.  
3. FINANCIAL MARKETS 
The euro depreciated further– The euro exchange rate has experienced large 
swings against some other major currencies since 

the beginning of this year amid cyclical and 

monetary policy differentials in an environment of 

declining commodity prices and geopolitical 

tensions. The euro has followed a downward trend 

against the US dollar since May 2014. It fell to its 

lowest level in more than 12 years, close to 1.05 in 

mid-March, before firming somewhat and 

fluctuating in the 1.05-1.10 range thereafter. The 

euro also fell considerably
 against the Swiss franc 
following the Swiss National Bank™s decision to 

discontinue its minimum exchange rate target of 

1.20 Swiss francs per euro in mid-January 2015. 

At the same time, the euro appreciated strongly 

against the Russian rouble, which came under 

marked pressure amid geopolitical tensions related 

to the situation in Ukraine. While the euro 

weakened substantially against the pound sterling, 

it experienced more limited movements against 

most other EU currencies in the context of a 

number of monetary policy actions taken by 

several central banks in the EU. 
–amid diverging cyclical conditions and 
monetary policy stances across major 

economies. While the ECB and the People™s Bank of China 
have announced further monetary easing measures, 

the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan™s 

policies have remained broadly unchanged. In 

January, the ECB announced new measures aiming 

at providing a sufficient degree of monetary policy 

accommodation with the view to pursuing its price 

stability mandate (see Section I.1). 
The transmission of the additional monetary easing 
resulting from the implementation of the ECB™s 

expanded asset purchase programme (APP) to the 

real economy should contribute to a further 

improvement in the outlook for economic growth. 

On 9 March 2015, the EC
B started the effective 
purchases under the Public Sector Purchase 

Programme (PSPP) which ta
rgets securities with 
maturities between two and 30 years and with a 

yield not lower than the ECB™s deposit facility rate 

of -0.20%. By purchasing a significant amount of 

private and public assets, the ECB expects to 

improve financing conditions in the euro area 
EA and EU outlook 
  19 economy. Outright purchases should have a 
positive impact on asset valuations and investors' 

confidence, which in turn should support money 

supply and credit growth. Lower funding costs, 

improved asset valuations and confidence effects 

should stimulate investment and consumption and 

thus contribute to an increase in inflation rates 

towards the ECB™s objective as well as to the 

underpinning of medium to long-term inflation 

expectations. In non-euro area EU Member States, several 
central banks took further monetary 

accommodation measures. The Sveriges Riksbank 

cut its repo rate by 10 bps. to -0.1% and announced 

a government bond-buying programme in 

February. In mid-March, it cut its policy rate 

further by 15 bps. to -0.25% and scaled up its 

government bond purchases by SEK 30 bn. 

(around 0.75% of GDP) to prevent an appreciating 

krona from hindering an uptick in inflation. In the 

same vein, Danmarks Nationalbank lowered the 

deposit rate in four steps to -0.75% (from -0.05%) 

between January and February and conducted 

large-scale interventions in foreign exchange 

markets to defend the Danish krona™s peg to the 

euro amid appreciation pr
essure. Furthermore, the 
Danish Ministry of Finance decided to suspend the 

issuance of domestic and foreign bonds until 

further notice so as to limit foreign capital inflows. 

Conventional monetary easing measures were also 

taken by central banks in Romania, Poland and 

Hungary, which cut their key policy rates to 

historically low levels amid lower inflation 

expectations. Financial markets have performed strongly– Since the start of the y
ear, euro area sovereign 
bond yields have decreased significantly, fuelled 

first by declining inflation expectations and 

speculation about the launch of a sovereign bond 

purchase program by the ECB, and later on by the 

announcement of the ECB™
s expanded APP and its 
actual implementation. Th
e 10-year German Bund 
yield declined to a histor
ical low of 0.15% in mid-
April. As of late-March, part of the decline in peripheral 
sovereign bond yields that had been observed 

before, was undone due to technical factors (e.g. 

an increased number of 
bond issuances, thin 
liquidity and some rewinding of positions taken 

ahead of the ECB™s asset purchase programme), 
and some re-pricing associ
ated with the assessment 
of Greece. Supported by the twin pillars of supplementary 
non-standard monetary policy tools and the pick-

up in macroeconomic growth, EU equity and 

corporate bond prices firm
ed strongly. Almost all 
general stock market indices in EU Member States 

have risen since the start of the year, many by over 

20%, while market volatility indices have dropped 

significantly. In parallel with increasing equity 

prices, corporate bond spreads have tightened and 

default perception indices have declined. Outside 

the EU, Asian markets outp
erformed global stock 
markets. Meanwhile, looming US monetary policy 

tightening and softening growth have been the 

main drivers of the unde
rperformance of US stock 
markets. 
–while bank lending continues to recover. Net lending flows to households continued on a 

stable but positive trend while those for non-

financial corporations (NFCs) have gradually 

become less negative (see Graph I.13). The credit 

cycles of households and NFCs are rather 

asynchronous and correl
ate differently with 
economic cycles.

Graph I.13:
Economic and credit cycles for NFCs, euro area
y-o-y%
 The credit cycle to households has been stagnant 
since 2013 even though nominal GDP has risen. 

The correlation which existed in the past has 

broken down due to specifi
c factors, such as house 
price corrections in some countries, the increased 

use of self-funding for house purchases and 

weaker consumer credit.
 For NFCs the current 
bank credit cycle is relativ
ely weaker compared to 
previous cycles, but follows historical relationships 

with economic cycles in terms of timing, i.e. it lags 

the economic cycle by several quarters. This 
European Economic Forecast, Spring 2015 
  20 suggests that the corporat
e sector in the euro area 
has become less dependent on bank credit as 

alternative funding sources have been developing. 

First, corporations are more intensively using 

internal funds for their investment, particularly 

during the early stages of economic cycles. 

Second, large corporations have increasingly 

turned to the market for 
direct funding via bonds, 
thereby lowering their needs for bank loans. 
The transition towards market financing has 
emerged as a dominant trend since the crisis, but 

this process is slowing down as bank lending 

recovers. The cycles of bank credit and bond 

issuance appear negativel
y correlated since the 
beginning of the crisis wh
ile they grew in parallel 
before 2008 (Graph I.14). During episodes of bank 

lending contraction, market funding was rising 

more rapidly, thus cushioning the overall external 

funding gap while during periods of recovery in 

bank lending, market funding tended to grow less 

rapidly. This feature is being reproduced in the 

current context of bank lending recovery as the 

annual grow rate of net issuance of debt securities 

by NFCs is decelerating (3.6% in January 2015 

from 9.5% in January 2014). It remains however 

important to note that bank and market funding are 

not perfect substitutes as only large corporations 

have access to bond markets. Given the importance 

of SMEs in the euro area, it seems crucial that 

smaller corporations resort more intensively to 

bank credit for the economic recovery to gain 

momentum.

 The rebounding trend in lending volumes for 
NFCs hides growing differences between 

countries. Unlike for lending rates, divergences in 

lending volumes have risen over the last two years 

(see Graph I.15). This suggests ongoing 

consolidation in some countries despite more 
favourable price and non-price lending conditions 
(see Box I.1). The relatively high level of 

corporate savings compared to investments in 

vulnerable Member States points to weak demand 

for credit.

 At the aggregate level, bank lending in the euro 
area is expected to recover further. Besides the 

boost given to lending from the cyclical upturn, the 

ECB™s latest Bank Lending Survey points to a 

further net easing of credit standards on loans to 

enterprises but a slight net tightening of credit 

standards on loans to households for house 

purchases. The ECB™s expanded asset purchase 

programme is expected to add some further 

momentum, improving the liquidity position of 

banks. Last year™s asset quality review showed that 

banks are, on the whole, better capitalised than 

during the crisis and hence in a better position to 

withstand losses on their outstanding lending to the 

private sector. However, relatively low capital 

buffers and high levels of non-performing loans in 

a number of Member States may impair the 

transmission channel of the ECB™s QE into bank 

lending (see Box I.2 for more details). 
EA and EU outlook 
  21 4. GDP AND ITS COMPONENTS 
The recovery from the economic and financial 
crisis, the sovereign debt crisis and the second leg 

of the protracted double-dip recession has been a 

long and tedious process, marked by several 

disappointments and unfulfilled expectations. The 

post-crisis legacy and EU-specific factors, such as 

high levels of public and private debt, have been 

blamed for the very subdued recovery from the 

troughs reached in 2008-09. 
(26) So far, structural 
weaknesses have not been overcome everywhere 

in the EU and even years after the start of the 

economic and financial crisis, the implementation 

of structural reforms remains unfinished. But the 

situation has changed with the sharp decline in oil 

prices in the second half of last year and with 

increased policy support in recent months, not only 

on the monetary side but also the fiscal side, as the 

neutral fiscal policy stance of the EU will weigh 

less on growth and the Investment Plan for Europe 

should help stimulate investment. 
Economic recovery remains on track– In 2014, the EU™s economic recovery stayed on 

track. Since its beginning in
 the second quarter of 
2013, economic activity in the EU and in the euro 

area has increased moderately but steadily. After 

moderating in the first half of last year, GDP 

growth picked up slightly for two consecutive 

quarters. With real GDP growth rising to 0.4%  

(q-o-q) in the EU and to 0.3% in the euro area in 

the fourth quarter of 2014, the annual rate of 

economic growth increased 
to 1.4% in the EU and 
0.9% in the euro area. 
The breakdown of GDP growth shows that in 2014 
domestic demand became the main contributor 

(see Graph I.16), mainly reflecting the expansion 

of private consumption. With higher real gross 

disposable income and some improvements in the 

labour market, private consumption accelerated 

substantially. Investment, however, remained weak 

because of moderate demand, low levels of 

capacity utilisation, heightened economic and 

policy uncertainty, as well as corporate 

deleveraging and persistent funding constraints in 

some countries. In the last quarter of 2014, 

however, investment growth strengthened. After 

                                                          
 (26) The reasons have been looked at in greater detail in the 
autumn 2014 forecast; see European Commission (DG 
ECFIN), European Economic Forecast Š Autumn 2014, 

European Economy
, 2014, No 7, pp. 8Œ12. 
three years as the main engine of growth, net trade 
detracted slightly from the EU™s GDP growth in 

2014, although it continued to benefit growth in 

the euro area.

Graph I.16:
Real GDP growth and its components, EU
 –with several tailwinds in its favour– A number of factors are expected to support 
economic activity going forward. 
On the external side, 
low oil prices
, although 
somewhat higher than in the winter, will continue 

to have a positive impact through their favourable 

effect on real disposable income and on firms™ 

production costs. 
(27)
 In an environment of very 
low inflation with nominal interest rates close to 

zero, the overall effect may be smaller than under 

more regular circumstances when the 

disinflationary impact provides space for lower 

nominal interest rates, which cushion the impact 

on real interest rates. However, real interest rates 

have recently been lowered by the rebound in 

inflation expectations. Given the expected pass-

through of lower oil prices to the economy, the 

impact on economic activity should already have 

set in last year and should continue over the 

forecast horizon. The depreciation of the euro
 should continue 
boosting external demand, by improving the price 

competitiveness of euro area firms.

  22 to export elasticity and trade patterns. For instance, 
in some economies, growing participation in 

global value chains may reduce the exchange rate 

pass-through to the terms of trade, which could 

reduce the overall impact of a weaker euro. 
(29) At 
the same time, the depreciation of the euro will 

raise import prices, which in turn should stimulate 

demand for domestic goods. In the euro area, it 

reduces the impact of declines in dollar-

denominated commodity prices such as oil, and 

enlarges the impact 
of their rebound. 
In assessing the overall impact, some limiting 
factors have to be taken into account. Apart from 

changing patterns in world trade, the specific 

situation of exporters in 
countries with close trade 
links to Russia could dampen the impact. 

Moreover, empirical analyses suggest that only 

about half of the change in exchange rates is 

usually passed on to export prices and that the 

growth of export markets is more important for 

export growth than price competitiveness. 
(30) It is

  EA and EU outlook 
  23 The pace of 
fiscal consolidation
 has slowed and 
thereby the fiscal drag has diminished (for details 

see section I.8). The Investment Plan for Europe
 should mobilise 
investment. However, as the plan will take time to 

roll out and the benefits from such investments 

may take time to realise, the Investment Plan is 

expected to have a much greater effect in 2016 and 

beyond than this year. More
over, no information is 
available about the sectoral and geographical 

allocation of the investment projects. The 

treatment of the plan in the present projections is 

therefore prudent, with risks on the upside. 
Despite the fact that some crisis-related obstacles 
remain in place, the positive impact of these 

factors on GDP growth should dominate the short-

term outlook.  
–that should help further strengthen the 
recovery in the near term... For the first quarter of 2015, 
survey indicators point towards an acceleration of economic activity 

and reinforce the outlook of solid growth. Both the 

Commission™s Economic Sentiment Indicator 

(ESI) and the PMI Composite Index improved 

more strongly in the first quarter of 2015 than in 

the last quarter of 2014, pointing to a pick-up in 

economic growth in the EU
 and the euro area (see 
Graph I.17). Positive sentiment and confidence 
should be a spur to domestic demand components. 
In March, the OECD™s leading indicator showed 

higher momentum in the 
euro area for the fourth 
month in a row.

 for the first quarter corroborates this 
positive picture, pointing to a slight strengthening 

of activity. In February, the three month-on-three 

month growth rate of industrial production 

continued increasing (up by 0.1 pps.) and stood at 

0.9% in the EU and in the euro area. On average, 

in the first two months, industrial production was 

0.7% higher in the euro area and 0.6% higher in 

the EU than in the last quarter of 2014.

  European Economic Forecast, Spring 2015 
  24 Monetary developments
 in January and February 
as well as the ECB™s April Bank Lending Survey 

show that credit flows are picking up, continuing a 

development that began in mid-2014, before the 

ECB™s latest round of non-standard measures. 

These measures, however, seem to have 

accelerated credit developments and money supply 

growth. This is evident in the strong annual growth 

of the most liquid monetary aggregate M1.  
–and accelerate growth over the forecast 
horizon. In 2015, economic tailwinds will provide an extra 
boost to the cyclical recovery underway, which is 

supported by more durable factors such as the 

fruits of previously implemented reforms and the 

broadly neutral fiscal stance. Under these 

conditions, economic growth is expected to 

continue gaining pace 
throughout the year. 
Accelerating economic ac
tivity should
 allow for 
further improvements in labour market conditions, 

from which private consumption will benefit. 

Increased demand and somewhat lower balance-

sheet adjustment needs should support greater 

investment, helping the economic recovery to 

become more sustainabl
e. Exports too should 
benefit from the strengthening of global demand 

and the depreciation of the euro. The strength in 

GDP growth will, however, continue to be 

restrained for some time by the impact of some 

adverse factors. These include high unemployment 

rates in some countries and geopolitical tensions 

with Russia.  
In 2016, the lagged competitive impulse stemming 
from the exchange rate developments will likely 

continue to boost export growth. Moreover, while 

oil futures suggest a partial recovery in prices, oil 

is expected to remain relatively cheap. Also, the 

ECB™s monetary policy measures are expected to 

continue to support activity at least until their 

earliest exit date in September 2016. On top of 

these factors, the Invest
ment Plan should take 
effect next year, lifting both public and private 

investment. In parallel, continued improvements in 

labour market conditions and lower balance-sheet 

adjustment needs will further strengthen domestic 

demand. Finally, GDP growth in 2016 should 

continue benefitting from previously-implemented 

reforms and the lower fiscal drag.  
Overall, real GDP is projected to grow by 1.8% in 
the EU and by 1.5% in the euro area in 2015 
before rising to 2.1% and 1.9% respectively in 
2016 (see Graphs I.1 and I.18).

2.0-0.4
0.91.51.9 Projections for 2016 shou
ld be seen against the 
background of the no-policy-change assumption. 

Potential output is set to edge up to about only 1% 

in both the EU and the euro area, as the 

contributions from capital, labour and TFP remain 

low, which implies that the EU and the euro area 

should grow above potential in both years. 

Whether the pace of GDP growth, bolstered by 

demand growth, can be sustained beyond the 

forecast horizon will depend
 on potential growth 
and thus on a rebound in investment and the 

implementation of reforms. Expectations about 

potential output should already affect the 

behaviour of companies and consumers towards 

the end of the forecast hori
zon. In that regard, a 
weak medium-term outlook could negatively affect 

the near-term forecast and 
thereby limit the scope 
for investment, weakening GDP growth during the 

forecast years. 
The current tide is lifting all boats in the EU– EU economies grow at different rates for a number 

of well-investigated reasons. 
(31)
 Against this 
background the present situation appears to be 

unique as the current tide of positive forces 

appears to be lifting all boats at the same time, 

either by sustaining solid positive growth or, at 

least, by raising the growth rate (see Graph I.19).

%%20152016 In the fourth quarter of 2014, growth momentum 
came mainly from Germany, Poland, the UK, 

Spain and the Netherlands, while real GDP in 

France and Italy barely moved. Four countries 

reported negative growth rates (q-o-q): Cyprus

Country-specific structural
 features (e.g. catching-
up in some Member States) and different cyclical 

positions (e.g. between countries inside and 

outside the euro area) resu
lt in growth differences. 
In fact, the most recent data for GDP growth 

suggest that the recovery in the EU has continued 

to broaden with the output gap having narrowed 

last year in about two thirds of the Member States. 

A further narrowing is ex

horizon, including the largest Member States (see

Graph I.20:
Cross-country differences in the output gap,

 –but the waves differ across Member States. Economic growth rates in the EU™s Member States 
will continue to differ as economic performance is 

greatly influenced by idiosyncratic features. These 
include different rates of progress in tackling 
structural weakness and in implementing reforms. 

In recent months, differences in the pass-through 

of lower oil prices and, in the euro area, different 

responses to the depreciation of the euro, have 

become differentiating factors. They add to other 

factors such as differences in balance-sheet 

adjustment, deleveraging in the private sector, 
(32)
 and consolidation efforts in the public sector. 
Among the largest Member States, activity should 
be dynamic over the forecast horizon in Poland, 

Spain and the UK with growth rates well above the 

EU average. Economic activity should stay robust 

in Poland on the back of solid domestic demand. In 

Spain, the recovery is accelerating this year, 

supported by improved labour-market and 

financing conditions, although a moderation in 

growth is expected next year. Growth in the UK is 

expected to remain robust 
but to calm this year and 
next as investment growth cools. In Germany, 

economic growth is expect
ed to be driven by 
exceptionally robust domestic demand with private 

consumption underpinned by an improving labour 

market. Economic activity in France is expected to 

slowly gain momentum thanks to private 

consumption, but the delay in the recovery of 

investment is keeping GDP growth below the euro 

area average. Italy™s economy
 is expected to return 
to growth this year, than
ks to increasing external 
demand, and to strengthen next year once 

investment picks up. Although short-term 

deleveraging pressures are expected to abate in the 

Netherlands, they will continue to limit the 

potential for a faster recovery. 
Among the euro area Member States that have or 
have had adjustment programmes, growth is 

expected to remain robust in Ireland but to turn 

positive only next year in Cyprus. Economic 

growth is gathering momentum in Portugal thanks 

to improved domestic demand and strong exports. 

In Greece, policy uncer
tainty has already 
weakened confidence and af
fects the pace of the 
incipient recovery.

 The differences between countries can also be seen 
in their respective contributions to the EU's 

economic growth (see Gr
aph I.21). Over the 
forecast horizon, the la
rgest contributions are 
expected from Germany 
and the UK, whereas the 
contributions of some other large economies 

remain smaller than what their country weights 

would suggest. 
Investment is still a weak spot in the recovery–  In line with the usual patterns following deep 

financial crises, the recovery of investment has 

been subdued, as some crisis-related factors 

continue to weigh (e.g. balance-sheet repair, 

persisting uncertainty). 
(33)
 While several factors 
can start a recovery (e
.g. exports, private 
consumption), an increase in investment is a 

necessary condition for a recovery's sustainability, 

which otherwise would depend on temporary or 

purely cyclical factors. In 2014, total investment remained subdued, 
particularly in the euro area
. It grew by 2.5% in the 
EU and by 1.1% in the euro area. This reflected 

moderate demand growth, low levels of capacity 

utilisation (economic slack), economic and policy 

uncertainty associated with geopolitical 

concerns 
(34)
, as well as corporate deleveraging and 
remaining credit supply constraints in some 

countries. In the fourth quarter of 2014, however, 

investment finally picked up and contributed 

positively to GDP growth. It increased by 0.4%  

                                                          
 (33) See also the analysis of crisis-related factors behind the 
subdued recovery in the EU; European Commission (DG 
ECFIN), European Economic Forecast Š Autumn 2014, 
European Economy
, 2014, No 7. 
(34) The 
European Policy Uncertainty Index
 increased from 
110 in June to 199 in September (annual average was 150), 
driven by developments in Germany and the UK where the 

year™s peak was reco
rded in September. 
(q-o-q) in both the EU and the euro area. The 
breakdown of total investment shows that this 

pick-up was only driven by developments in 

construction investment, which strongly rebounded 

in both the EU and the euro area. By contrast, 

investment in equipment decelerated strongly and 

remained broadly flat in both regions.  
Many analysts have argued that a large investment 
gap has built up in the EU. An extensive literature 

has identified output dynamics, the user cost of 

capital, uncertainty, financial constraints, and 

corporate leverage as key factors explaining the 

weakness of private non
-residential investment 
across the euro area. 
(35)
 To address this weakness of investment, the 
Investment Plan for Europe 
(36)
 was announced in 
November 2014 with the target of generating EUR 

315 bn. of new investment within three years. As 

of spring 2015, the plan appears to be on track and 

the EIB is expected to start financing the first SME 

projects soon. In principle, the impact should start 

entering the outlook in the second half of 2015, but 

without information about implementation details, 

in particular the selection of projects to be 

financed, it remains impossible to pencil in its 

effects on individual coun
tries. A sizeable impact 
should be observed in 2016 and thereafter, with the 

time profile depending on decision, 

implementation and disbursement lags. Moreover, 

cross-country differences should depend on 

countries™ general investment conditions, the 

involvement of national promotional banks (public 

investment banks), the pipeline of projects, and 

investment platforms. 
Overall, total investment is forecast to grow by 
2.6% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro area in 2015.

EA and EU outlook 
  27 –despite the expected pick-up in equipment 
investment– Since the beginning of the recovery in spring 2013, 
equipment investment has outperformed GDP 

growth in both the EU (cumulated growth of 7.3% 

up to the fourth quarter of 2014 versus cumulated 

GDP growth of 2.4%) and in the euro area (5.8% 

vs. 1.7%), but taking into account that the fall in 

investment was deeper than declines in other GDP 

components, the recovery is still far from reaching 

the levels GDP has recorded. Also, as compared to 

long-term averages, invest
ment growth has by far 
not been sufficient for a substantial rebound (see 

Graph I.22).

forecast
Graph I.22:
Equipment investment and capacity utilisation, EU
 In the near term, the growth in equipment 
investment should exceed that of real GDP in both 

the euro area and the EU. This outlook is 

supported by surveys such as the positive 

assessment in the first quarter of 2015 of total and 

export order books in the EU and the euro area, 

which continue to exceed 
their long-term averages. 
Also, hard data shows that
 compared to the last 
quarter of 2014, the industrial production of capital 

goods in January and February (average), 

increased by 0.5% in the EU and by 0.4% in the 

euro area. Finally, after having been constrained 

by low capacity utilisation and weak demand, 

equipment investment is expected to gain traction 

over the forecast horizon. Among the supporting 

factors are strengthening domestic and external 

demand, improved business sentiment, and 

improved profit margins (e.g. due to lower energy 

prices, wage moderation and lower funding 

costs). (37)

 The need to renovate the stock of capital should 
also act as an incentive. 
The relatively low level of 
investment (‚investment gap™) since the crisis 

suggests the existence of pent-up demand for 

private investment. The financing scope for such 

investment appears favourable. While internal 

funding is expected to be
 backed by significant 
cash positions and growing gross operating 

surpluses, external funding should benefit from the 

relaxation in lending conditions which the April 

2015 Bank Lending Survey signalled in the euro 

area. In the euro area, support could also be seen in 

rising profits (see Graph I.23) and the flattening of 

the yield curve (see Graph I.8), which should have 

a more pronounced effect on real longer-term 

interest rates than usually attributed to 

conventional monetary policy stimulus. 
(38)
 Thus, 
although the interest rate sensitivity of investment 

plans might be rather low, 
(39)
 the accommodative 
monetary policy strengthened by the ECB™s non-

standard monetary policy measures and in 

particular by the APP, 
could help to increase 
capital spending in 2015 and beyond. In the same 

vein, by reducing funding costs for investment 

projects, the Investment Plan for Europe could 

have a positive impact on both public and private

  28 investment in 2016, in particular, as it entails 
projects that meet the ‚additionality™ criterion. 
The factors influencing equipment investment and 
its growth vary considerably across the Member 

States. Among the only five euro area countries 

where equipment investment has grown in both 

2013 and 2014 are Spain, Portugal, and Ireland. In 

these countries, improved cost competitiveness has 

raised exports and lifted corporate investment. The 

other two countries were Lithuania and Malta. As 

regards the largest EU Memb
er States, in 2015 the 
downward revisions in the forecasts for UK (by 

2.4 pps.), France (by 1.1 pps.), and Germany (by 

0.8 pps.) contribute to the explanation of the 

moderation of growth in equipment investment 

(from 4.9% in 2014 to 3.3% in 2015). Moreover, 

in some countries special factors raised equipment 

investment in 2014 (e.g. delivery of vessels in 

Belgium) and result now, even if high levels are 

sustained, in only moderate growth rates. 
–and the ongoing rebound in construction 
investment. While construction investment in the euro area has 
contracted in each of th
e last three years, it 
expanded in the EU last year, thanks to substantial 

growth in almost all non-euro area Member States. 

The most recent data from
 the fourth quarter of 
2014 suggest that the 
euro area has now also 
entered an expansion period. Investment in 

construction grew by 0.9% (q-o-q) in the EU and 

by 0.8% in the euro area. 
In the first two months of 2015, construction 
output increased 0.5% in the euro area and fell 

0.1% in the EU, compared
 to the average of the 
fourth quarter. Leading indicators suggest only 

moderate growth going forward. According to the 

Commission™s surveys, managers in the 

construction sector were slightly less optimistic in 

the first quarter of 2015 than in the last quarter of 

2014 and their assessment of order books has 

remained almost unchanged in the EU and 

deteriorated in the euro area. 
The Investment Plan for Europe should eventually 
have a positive impact on construction investment, 

but, as in the case of equipment investment, the 

impact will become more meaningful towards the 

end of the forecast horiz
on, as decisions about 
projects, implementation and disbursement will 

take time. 
As regards residential construction, with (real) 
house prices moving up, a key ingredient for 

growing construction activity has taken hold. The 

latest data for house prices point to an ongoing 

rebound in the EU (up 2.6% y-o-y in 2014-Q4) and 

the euro area (up 1.1%), with prices in some hard-

hit countries, notably Spain, showing signs of 

stabilisation. The pick-up in household real 

disposable income, the low and declining 

mortgage rates in some countries, and easing 

financing conditions should have a positive impact 

from 2015. But ongoing adjustments in the 

housing market are expected to continue to act as a 

drag on residential investment in several countries 

(Greece, France, Italy, Slovakia and Bulgaria) 

though to a lesser extent in 2016 than in 2015. 
Private consumption continues to be the main 
growth driver– Since private consumption is
 the cornerstone of the 
EU economy, accounting for 
roughly two-thirds of 
GDP, it has been an importa
nt factor in the recent 
acceleration in GDP. Alth
ough the imp
act of the 
oil price decline in the second half of last year may 

have catalysed the strong
er growth of private 
consumption, other factors have also contributed 

markedly. Helped by in
creases in real gross 
disposable income and some improvements in 

labour market conditions, last year private 

consumption last year grew 1.4% in the EU and 

1.0% in the euro area (see Graph I.24).

 –supported by higher real disposable 
incomes– In 2014, the expansion of real gross disposable 
incomes in both the EU and the euro area was due 

to stronger growth in co
mpensations alongside low 
or even negative inflation (see Graph I.25). 
EA and EU outlook 
  29  On the nominal side, growth in 
compensation 
of employees
 increased in 2014, driven by 
improved labour market conditions, which 

resulted in higher employment and higher 

increases in compensation per employee. 

Moreover, 
transfers
 increased again at an 
annual rate of about 2%. 
Non-labour incomes
, which include profit income, followed an 

upward trend. 
 The purchasing power
 of incomes was raised 
by the impact of last year™s fall in the prices of 
energy and unprocessed food. This cut out less 

of the nominal increases in the years before so 

that households™ real disposable incomes 

increased. 
 Private wealth
 increased on the back of 
rebounding house and financial asset prices. 

Moreover, the continued decline in interest 

rates lowered the costs of servicing household 

debt, which lowered the negative impact of the 

consumption channel of the financial crisis.

 The only moderate increase in the savings rate in 
the second half of last year (from 12.7% to 12.9% 

in the euro area) mean
t that these gains in 
disposable incomes translated to a substantial 

extent into higher spending. 
–and increased consumer confidence– In the near term, the expansion of private 

consumption should remain underpinned by 

improving labour market conditions, notably the 

favourable impact of rising wage growth on the 

back of increasing employment, and low consumer 

price inflation. 
Leading indicators for the first quarter of 2015 
suggest a strengthening of private consumption 

growth. The Commission™s 
Consumer Confidence 
indicator
 improved markedly in the first quarter of 
2015, reaching the highes
t level since the Great 
Recession in 2008-09 (see Graph I.24). This 

mainly reflected a more optimistic assessment of 

the past and expected general economic situation 

as well as lower 
unemployment fears
, which have 
fallen to their lowest level since mid-2007. Also, 

consumer 
price expectations
 declined 
significantly, factoring in low oil prices. In 

addition, in March the number of households 

planning 
major purchases
 increased to their 
highest level since October 2007 in the EU and 

since April 2008 in the eu
ro area (see Graph I.26), 
which could hint at a positive impact of increasing 

inflation expectations and the readiness to spend 

on durables. 
(40)
 In a similar vein, 
retail confidence
 improved significantly in the first quarter 

compared to the previous quarter, reflecting an 

improved assessment of both the present and 

future business situation. If sustained, given the 

historical relationship between surveys and private 

consumption, the latest readings bode well for 

private consumption in 2015.

 The combination of increasing real disposable 
income and higher c
onsumer confidence is 
expected to continue
 supporting private 
consumption in 2015. The compensation of 

employees should rise by 2.3% in the euro area 

and, partly reflecting the appreciation of currencies 

in non-euro area Member States, by 4.5% in the 

EU. Enhanced by strong growth in non-labour 

incomes this lifts nominal disposable incomes 

markedly. Given the outlook for low inflation in 

2015, nominal increases tr
anslate into strong real 
increases in disposable incomes. Due to higher 

financial asset prices and further improvements in 

housing markets, financial and housing wealth 

should impact positively on household spending 

decisions, underpinned by favourable financing 

conditions. 
The annual household savings ratio is expected to 
increase by 0.2 pps. in 20
15 in both the euro area 
and in the EU, partly reflecting the partial saving 
of the windfall from energy prices in an attempt to 
smoothen inter-temporal consumption. At the same 

time, other effects drive the savings rate, which 

includes relatively low interest rates (discouraging 

savings), an improving labour market (less forced 

dissaving), declining uncertainty (less 

precautionary saving), and household deleveraging 

needs in several Member States. 
(41)
 These developments provide plenty of scope for 
private consumption to 
accelerate towards annual 
rates of 2.1% in the EU and 1.8% in the euro area 

in 2015. 
–with the outlook for strong growth over the 
forecast horizon. Looking further ahead, the pick-up in the growth 
rate of private consumption should continue at 

more or less the same rate. But with energy prices 

rebounding, consumer price inflation is expected 

to move up gradually. As a result, the forces 

underlying consumption dynamics should change, 

as wage increases, non-labour incomes and the 

labour market situation become the most important 

drivers of future real disposable incomes. 
With oil prices rebounding, the large purchasing 
power lift to households should gradually fade 

from the scene in 2016. However, with 

deleveraging needs gradually diminishing, with 

consumer confiden
ce picking up and 
unemployment gradually declining further, the 

savings ratio should stop increasing in 2016. 

Experience from previous periods of strong 

financial asset price growth (2002, 2007) suggest 

direct wealth effects on consumption may not to be 

perceptible in the euro area 
(42) and may contribute 
only to a very limited extent elsewhere in the EU. 

However, financial market developments (see

through increased private sector confidence. 
(43) All these factors should translate into a slight 
deceleration of private cons
umption to 1.9% in the 
EU and 1.6% in the euro area in 2016. 
A modest contribution from government 
consumption– Government consumption expenditure was more 
supportive to economic growth last year than in 

any of the three years before. Steady expansion in 

the euro area (0.2% q-o-q in all quarters) and more 

volatile expansion in the EU (between 0.2% and 

0.5% q-o-q) resulted in annual growth rates of 

0.7% and 1.0% respectively. In 2015, government 

consumption in both areas is set to increase at a 

slower pace (0.6% and 0.
8%, respectively). As 
consolidation needs subsist in several Member 

States, shrinking government consumption is 

expected in seven Member States, including Italy 

and France. 
Further out, public consumption is expected to 
grow in 2016 by 0.8% in both the euro area and in 

the EU (see also Section 
I.8). Public consumption 
is only expected to shri
nk in Cyprus, Greece and 
Hungary. However, the forecast for 2016 is based 

on a no-policy-change assumption, according to 

which fiscal measures are 
only factored in if they 
have already been adopted by national parliaments 

or are known in sufficient detail. 
–and only a marginal growth impact of net 
exports– The acceleration of global
 economic activity and 
world trade in 2014 has expanded EU and euro 

area export markets by about 3% and thus by more 

than the two years befo
re combined. This has 
given a boost to export growth (goods and 

services) in both areas, supported in the euro area 

by the depreciation of the effective exchange rate 

of the euro towards the end of last year. However, 

the stronger domestic demand resulted in an even 

stronger boost to imports growth rates which 

almost tripled in both ar
eas in 2014 and exceeded 
export growth. As a result the contribution of net 

exports to GDP growth fell markedly from 0.4 pps. 

in both areas in 2013 to 
0.1 pps. in the euro area 
and -0.1 pps. in the EU last year.

 –as strong growth of exports– As regards the near-term 
outlook, external trade 
indicators are sending mixed signals. The first hard 

data for the first quarter of 2015 show that in 

January, euro-area merchandise exports were 1.5% 

below the average of the fourth quarter. By 

contrast, the assessment of export order books in 

both the Commission™s manufacturing survey and 

in the PMI, improved in the first quarter of 2015, 

compared to the previous 
quarter in both the EU 
and the euro area. 
Supported by a further strengthening of global 
demand and the euro depreciation in the first 

quarter of 2015, EU exports should accelerate this 

year and next (see Graph I.28). EU export market 

shares are set to increase 
over the forecast horizon 
thanks to improved price competitiveness, which is 

only partly used to widen profit margins. Countries 

that have implemented structural reforms are 

expected to see particular improvements in their 

export performance. 
(44)
  Export growth prospects in 2015, however, 
continue to be held back somewhat by the impact 

of tensions with Russia. While the overall effect 

should remain modest, countries with high 

exposure to Russia will be more affected. Due to 

the technical assumption about the continuation of 

tensions and sanctions until the end of July 2015, 

this effect will persist for some time. 
Overall, EU exports of goods and services are 
expected to grow by 4.2% in the EU in 2015 and

  32 5.2% in 2016, while euro 
area exports are expected 
to rise by 4.4% this year and 5.4% next year. 
–meets even stronger import growth. In line with the recovery in domestic demand and 

goods exports, some of which have a high import 

content, and despite higher import prices, imports 

of goods and services are set to grow by 4.6% in 

the EU and by 4.6% in the euro area in 2015. They 

are then expected to accelerate to 5.6% and 5.9% 

respectively in 2016. Overall, net exports should 

have an almost neutral impact on GDP growth in 

both the euro area (0.1 pps. in 2015, 0.0% in 2016) 

and in the EU (0.0 pps. in both years).  
5. THE CURRENT ACCOUNT 
The current account surplus in the EU and the euro 

area has widened sharply over the past few years 

amid subdued domestic demand, the gradual 

recovery in global economic growth and recent 

windfall gains from plunging oil prices. Continued 

tailwinds from lower commodity prices but also 

the marked depreciation of the euro are set to 

further strengthen the current account surpluses of 

both areas over the forecast horizon.  
Oil propels current account surplus to a record 
high in 2014– The steep fall in oil pri
ces since mid-2014 was the 
main driver of trade 
flows and current account 
movements last year. The shrinking deficit in the 

oil trade balance of the EU
 more than offset the 
decline in the non-oil trade balance and resulted in 

an increasing surplus in 
the overall trade balance 
(see Graph I.29). The dominant role of oil prices is 

also evident from developments in the balance of 

payments over the last four quarters. The balance 

of trade in goods increased
 steadily in both the EU 
(from 0.2% of GDP in 2014-Q1 to 0.6% in  

2014-Q4) and the euro ar
ea (from 2.1% to 2.9%), 
whereas the surplus in th
e balance of trade in 
services steadily declined over the same period. 

Aggregated developments in the euro area, 

however, mask the proces
s of intra-euro area 
rebalancing that has been continuing (see Box I.3).  
Despite mitigating effects from the lower euro 
exchange rate, lower commodity prices have led to 

sharp declines in import prices, which gradually 

spread to domestic prices. The lower energy bill 

has had a more moderate impact on production 
input costs and export prices. Against this 
background in 2014, gradually abating pressures 

on the terms of trade, mostly in the EU, and 

improved export performance boosted the adjusted 

merchandise trade balance in the EU (to 0.3% of 

GDP) and the euro area (to 3.2% of GDP).

 With the euro area's trad
e surplus surging, the 
adjusted current account ba
lance increased in 2014 
by 0.5 pps. to 3.0% of GDP, as a result of 

improved balances in most euro area Member 

States. While oil price and exchange rate 

developments supported rebalancing in countries 

that needed to strengthen their external positions, it 

also widened already exis
ting surpluses. Sizeable 
current account surpluses of net creditor 

economies, particularly Germany and the 

Netherlands, accounted for more than half of the 

overall variation in the euro area current account 

balance in 2014. In the 
EU, the adjusted current 
account balance also moved to a higher surplus on 

aggregate, despite a larger
-than-expected deficit in 
the UK and moderating surpluses in Sweden and 

Denmark.  
–while domestic and external factors 
underpin a bullish outlook in 2015-16. The unwinding of both external and EU-specific 
factors is set to further 
widen the current account 
surplus in 2015 and 2016. First, lower oil prices 

are expected to continue 
to feed into lower import 
prices and hold back imports in nominal terms. 

The impact however fr
om commodity prices 
should be partly mitigated by the expected stronger 

                                                          
 (45) Adjusted EU (euro area) balances take into account 
discrepancies between intra-EU (intra-euro area) exports 
and intra-EU (intra-euro area) imports that cause 

differences between the sum of the balances of the 
respective Member States and the aggregate balance. 
EA and EU outlook 
  33 pick up in domestic demand growth and the 
gradual acceleration of vo
lumes of goods imports. 
Second, the sharp depreciatio
n of the euro leaps to 
the fore. The depreciation of the euro exchange 

rate in both real and nominal trade-weighted terms 

should bolster cost competitiveness and widen the 

merchandise trade surplus by making exports 

cheaper and imports more expensive. Third, the 

expected pick-up in private investment is unlikely 

to reverse current acco
unt surpluses in EU 
countries with excess savings. Against this 

backdrop, the adjusted cu
rrent account surplus is 
projected to widen further in 2015 to 1.5% of GDP 

in the EU and 3.5% of GDP in the euro area.

account balances are forecast to improve by 0.2% 
to 0.7% of GDP in most
 euro area economies that 
had recorded high external
 sector deficits in the 
late 2000s (Spain, Latvia, Portugal, Greece, and 

Italy). In Portugal, the 
current account surplus is 
expected to increase furt
her this year. Current 
account surpluses are forecast to widen further in 

Germany and moderate in the Netherlands. 
The outlook for a higher cu
rrent account surplus in 
the EU is, apart from developments in the euro 

area™s current account, mainly due to shrinking 

deficits in the UK and Czech Republic and 

widening surpluses in Hungary, Bulgaria and 

Croatia.  
Looking ahead, the build-up of the current account 
surplus should gradually peter out in 2016 as oil 

prices recover. The ad
justed curr
ent account 
balance-to-GDP ratios of 
the EU and the euro area 
should move to 1.6% and 3.4% respectively, as

strengthen.  
Overall, the expected ch
ange in the euro area™s 
current account balance-to-GDP ratio in 2015-16 

compared to 2014 will mostly be driven by 

stronger export growth, partly offset by higher 

domestic demand (see Graphs I.30 and I.31).

ared to net creditor 
economies, such as Germany, should facilitate, to 

some extent, this rebalancing process. Still, current 

account developments continue to mask 

considerable asymmetries in the adjustment 

process between net debtor and net creditor 

economies, reflecting mostly
 cyclical factors at 
play in the former group and weak investment 

activity in the latter. Structural reforms aimed at 

raising productivity growth but also the 

attractiveness of foreign direct investment could 

lead to sustained current account improvements 

and lower the stock of foreign liabilities, especially 

in peripheral countries (see Box I.3). 
6. THE LABOUR MARKET 
The labour market conditions in the EU continue 

to recover, but progress is subdued and the 

situation is very different across the Member 

States. Since mid-2013, employment has risen and 

unemployment has fallen in both the EU and the 

euro area. As economic grow
th strengthens, labour 
market conditions should improve further. Growth, 

however, is unlikely to strengthen enough to 

reduce unemployment rates significantly. 
There is a generalised improvement in 
employment– Since the start of the recovery, employment has 
picked up relatively more quickly and strongly in 

response to output developments than expected 

given historical elasticities of employment to 

overall activity. This likely reflects the supportive 

impact of past wage moderation and recent labour 

market reforms. Overall, 
in 2014 the number of 
people employed grew by
 0.6% in the euro area 
and by 1.0% in the EU, the highest annual growth 

rates since 2008. In the fourth quarter, employment 

grew 0.1% (q-o-q) in the euro area and 0.2% in the 

EU (see Graph I.33). Compared to the same 

quarter of 2013, employment grew by 0.8% in the 

euro area and 0.9% in the EU. 
At the Member State level, besides positive 
developments in the German labour market, 

employment growth was driven to a large extent 

by improvements in countries with relatively high 

unemployment rates such as
 Spain, Portugal and 
Greece. Wage restraint and recently-implemented 

labour market reforms were key determinants and 

have increased the labour intensity of economic 

growth. Substantial differences were observed in 
terms of changes in self-employment in 2014, with 
the increase in the UK excee
ding that in the EU, 
and accounting for about one third of the increase 

in employment in the UK, 
(47)
 whereas self-
employment in the four largest euro area 

economies shrank despite overall gains in 

employment.

Graph I.33:
Employment growth and unemployment rate, EU
 In 2014 as a whole, increases were not confined to 
specific sectors, but were ra
ther broad based. In the 
euro area, employment improved particularly in 

the tradable and the non-tradable sectors 

(excluding construction) for the first time since 

2009. Job losses were concentrated in three sectors 

(agriculture, construction, and financial and 

insurance activities) compared to 10 out of 11 

sectors (NACE decomposition) in 2013. In the 

construction sector, the pace of employment 

destruction slowed marked
ly and the third quarter 
registered the first increase in headcount 

employment since the Great Recession. This could 

signal that the adjustment in the non-tradable 

sector is coming to an end. 
–and unemployment rates have fallen– Unemployment rates had continued to decline over 

the course of 2014 and during the first two months 

of this year. In February, the unemployment rate 

stood at 11.3% in the euro area and 9.8% in the 

EU, down from 11.8% an
d 10.5% a year earlier, 
shedding 1.2 pps. and 0.8 pps. respectively from 

their peaks in spring 2013. This decline reflects the 

combination of rising employment and a growing 

labour force. Over the course of the recovery, 

participation rates have moved up (added-worker 

effect). Ongoing declines in unemployment rates

EA and EU outlook

although substantial differences remain. 
Unemployment rates differ markedly with respect 
to age groups and the dura
tion of joblessness. The 
unemployment rate of young people
 not in 
education increased massively during the crisis 

years, reflecting a greater sensitivity of youth 

unemployment to developments in economic 

activity than that observed for other age groups. 
(48)
 In February 2015, unemployment among young 

people stood at 21.1% in the EU and 22.9% in the 

euro area (-1.8 pps. and 
-1.1 pps. than a year 
earlier), which is high by historical standards and 

in relation to other age groups (see Graph I.34).

 As regards developments in structural 
unemployment, the past decline in match 

efficiency is visible in 
the observed outward shift 
of the EU™s and the euro area™s Beveridge curves 

(which shows the negative relationship between 

the unemployment rate and the vacancy rate), 

which reveals that in 2014 there were more 

unemployed workers for a given level of vacancies 

than before the crisis (see Graph I.36). So far the 

economic recovery has not yet produced any 

reversal of the outward shift, which could signal an 

entrenched mismatch in parts of the European 

labour market.

 –and near-term prospects remaining 
favourable– In the near term, survey
 data suggest that the 
labour market probably improved in the first 

quarter of 2015 and there are some positive signals 

for the second quarter of the year. 
After having deteriorated in the second half of 
2014 employment expectations in industry and 

services began to turn around in December. In 

March 2015, they were back to levels not seen 

since 2011 (see Graph I.37). In the construction 

sector, employment expectations continued to 

grow modestly in recent 
quarters, but remain at 
very low levels. In the first quarter of 2015, hiring 

intentions in services and industry in the euro area 

stood markedly above the 
level of the previous 
quarter, and slightly below for the construction 

sector. According to the 
latest survey readings 
(March 2015), hiring intentions in the EU were 

above their long-term av
erages in all sectors 
covered by the surveys. 
In the euro area they 
remained below the long
-term average in the 
construction sector. Consumers™ unemployment 

fears have decreased markedly at the beginning of 

2015, in line with their more optimistic view about 

the general economic situat
ion for the next twelve 
months. Since October 2014, the employment 

component of the euro area PMI has been steadily 

increasing.

 –with the labour market recovery expected to 
continue in 2015 and 2016– Further out, with growth expected to strengthen in 
2015 but to remain uneven across countries, 

improvements in the labour market are set to 

continue but without being spectacular. 
 In 2015, this is expected to result in 
employment growth of 0.9% in the EU and in 

the euro area, and a d
ecline of unemployment 
rates to below the 10%-level in the EU (9.7%) 

and to 11.0% in the euro area. The recovery in 

employment is expected to be relatively strong 

in countries that implemented labour market 

reforms (e.g. Spain), while the German 

economy should continue creating new jobs but 

at a slower pace than in previous years, 

reflecting increasing supply bottlenecks in a 

context of very low unemployment rates. In 

Italy, the measures and reforms undertaken by 

the government at the beginning of 2015 

should start translating into higher employment 

(see Section II.12). 
 In 2016, the economic recovery should trigger 
further (net) job creation in the EU (1.0
%) and 
the euro area (1.1
%). Major recent reforms in 
the labour market, particularly in the stressed 

countries (including recent reforms in Italy) 

and the moderate degree of recent wage 

increases should continue to bear fruit and 

support job creation over 
the forecast horizon. 
This uptick in employment growth follows the 

narrowing of the negative output gap in both 

areas and is thus broadly compatible with 

Okun™s law, which links growth of GDP with 

changes in unemployment. In that regard, the 

expected strengthening in private consumption 

may be particularly good news for 
EA and EU outlook 
  37 employment, as it affects the GDP component 
that empirical studies have identified as having 

the largest positive employment effects. 
(51)
 The labour force is expected to grow moderately 
over the forecast horizon, 
mirroring the entrance of 
certain segments of the population as a result of 

the improved economic situation, as well as the 

impact of positive net migration inflows. 
The unemployment rate in the EU and the euro 
area is projected to dec
line somewhat over the 
forecast horizon, to 9.2%
 and 10.5% respectively 
in 2016, which remains 
well above the average 
levels observed between 2004 and 2008. The slow 

decline reflects cyclical factors such as an 

insufficiently strong and broad recovery but also 

the persistence of high structural unemployment. 

This is reflected in the historically high level of the 

NAWRU (Non Accelerating Wage Rate of 

Unemployment), which according to the 

Commission estimates has been increasing since 

2007 in the euro area to 9.8% of the labour force in 

2014 (and to 8.9% in the EU). The NAWRU is 

expected to broadly st
abilise over the forecast 
horizon. 
Labour productivity (output per person employed) 
is expected to increase gradually over the forecast 

horizon, reflecting the economic recovery and 

some lagged response of employment to 

developments in activity. In
 2016, it is set to reach 
1.1% and 0.8% in the EU and the euro area 

respectively. –but unemployment receding unevenly 
across Member States. In 2014, for the first time since the beginning of 
the economic and financial crisis, a timid 

convergence in labour market conditions across 

EU Member States starte
d, with unemployment 
decreasing also in those Member States that had 

recorded the highest increases following the

7. INFLATION 
Inflation in the EU and the euro area fell in late 

2014 and early 2015, dropping below zero in 

December. The important role of falling energy 

prices, reflecting the o
il price decline between 
mid-last year and early this year, underscores the 

transitory nature of the decline in the inflation 

rate. (52)
 Hints of a rebound in inflation rates– HICP inflation
 in the EU and th
e euro area slipped 
below zero in December after falling quite steadily 

over the past three years and being very low 

throughout 2014 (see Graph I.38). In January 

2015, mainly the sharp d
ecline in energy prices 
was responsible for dragging headline HICP 

inflation to a low of -0.5% in the EU and  

-0.6% in the euro area.
 Other components of 
inflation also helped to keep inflation below zero. 

Inflation in non-energy industrial goods hovered 

marginally below zero and the volatile 

unprocessed food component also fell deeply in 

December and January. The remaining slack in the 

economy and relatively weak domestic demand 

have kept underlying price pressures low. 
By February there were signals that annual 
headline inflation had bottomed out as it moved up 

to -0.2% in the EU and -0
.3% the euro area, with 
inflation in all the main HICP components higher 

than in January. The rebound continued in March 

to -0.1% in both the EU an
d the euro area, mainly 
reflecting an increase in
 food price inflation, 
especially unprocessed food, and a smaller decline 

in energy prices.

 Core inflation
 (all items excluding energy and 
unprocessed food) in the 
EU and the euro area, 
which had also been falling until January, ticked 

up in February but declined again in March as 

services inflation fell. Its weakness could be 

associated with muted la
bour cost developments, 
higher wage and price flexibility in some euro area 

countries as a result of structural reforms in labour 

and product markets in 
recent years, indirect 
effects of lower oil prices (e.g. via transportation 

services) 
(53)
, and, partly, the fading of last year™s 
VAT increase in France. While core inflation is 

generally more stable, the low level of core 

inflation reflects historically low services inflation 

due to weak demand and contained wage pressures 

but also declining non-en
ergy industrial goods 
inflation, which can be attributed to low input 

prices. In the first quarter of 2015, core inflation 

fell to 0.7% in the EU and 0.6% in the euro area, 

their lowest levels since the start of the series in 

1997. Services inflation (having a weight of 43%

 (53) A study conducted by Eurosystem staff found that around 
one third of the impact of oil price changes would be due to 
effects on other HICP than energy. See ECB, ‚Indirect

largely driven by domestic conditions, stood at 
1.3% (EU) and 1.1% (euro area) and inflation of 

non-energy industrial goods (weight of 26% in the 

euro area, 27% in the EU) at -0.2% and at -0.1%, 

respectively. –while external and producer price pressures 
remain weak– External price pressures
 continued to weaken in 
2014, mainly as a result of the decline in global 

commodity prices and al
so low price pressures 
along global supply chains. On the whole, import 

prices (measured by the deflator of goods imports) 

fell again in 2014, by around 2.5% in the EU and 

the euro area. This is in line with the fall in 

industrial import prices by 2.7% in 2014 in the 

euro area. The most recent information on 

industrial import prices points to a further fall in 

January 2015 and a small rebound in February. 
In 2015, in the EU and the euro area, the assumed 
path for global commodity prices is expected to 

drag down goods import prices of the whole 

economy again, by around 1½% in both regions. In 

the euro area, the steep rate
 of decline of the euro 
is expected to dampen or even reverse the impact 

of low global prices, especially later in the year 

when global commodity price inflation is assumed 

to return to positive territory. In 2016, import 

prices are expected to incr
ease by around 1.4% in 
both regions, consistent with the assumptions of 

both a low external value of the euro and also 

recovering global price pressures. 
Consistent with remaining price pressures even at 
industry levels, annual 
industrial producer price 
inflation
 was consistently and strongly negative 
throughout 2014 and fell in January to -4.1% in the 

EU and -3.5% in the euro area before slightly 

moving up in February. Producer price inflation 

was driven lower especially by falling energy 

prices, which have a partic
ularly strong impact at 
the industrial level. Declining producer prices were

  39 also evident in intermediate goods and non-durable 
consumer goods categories. However, reflecting 

narrowing output gaps as domestic demand picks 

up, prices in the final stages of the production 

chain, namely capital goods and durable consumer 

goods, rose slowly but still by less than 1% in both 

regions in February. 
–but the recovering labour market supports a 
gradual increase in wage growth. While employment is growing and unemployment 
rates are slowly declining across the EU, 
wage 
growth
 is still moderate. Data for the third and 
fourth quarters of 2014 show a slowing annual 

growth rate of wages and salaries in the euro area, 

whereas wage growth in the EU remains broadly 

unchanged as a number of non-euro area countries 

actually registered noticeable increases in wage 

growth. The growth in 
compensation per employee
 is projected to have slowed to 1.2% in the EU and 

1.3% in the euro area in 2014. 
In 2015 and 2016, growth in compensation per 
employee is expected to increase to 1.6% and 1.8% 

in the EU, but to remain subdued at 1.3% and 

1.5% in the euro area. With labour productivity 

projected to accelerate in both regions, 
unit labour 
cost growth is expected to remain stable at a rather 
low rate. Below average increases are expected in 

some Member States (e.g. Ireland, Spain, and 

Italy) that are adjusting,
 while in others (e.g. 
Germany) stronger increases are expected. 
Inflation expectations recovered slightly in 
early 2015– Expectations of future price developments play a 
major role in price-setting and wage-bargaining 

due to the fact that prices and wages are set at 

discrete intervals, so that firms and employees 

need to take a view on the evolution of prices and 

wages until the next opportunity to change them. 

This makes inflation expectations crucial in 

forecasting HICP inflation. 
In recent months, short- 
and longer-term inflation 
expectations implied by financial markets declined 

rather rapidly as oil prices fell steeply but quickly 

recovered when the ECB 
announced its expanded 
asset purchase programme (APP) on 22 January. 

Nonetheless, according to market-based indicators, 

long-term inflation expectations appear to have 

recently become more responsive to the changes in 

the short-term inflation outlook. In mid-April 
inflation expectations stood markedly above their 
historical lows of January and signalled low but 

positive inflation in the next few years. For the 

short term, inflation-linked swap rates at the one-

year-forward-one-year-ahead horizon stood at 

0.9%. Swap rates at the 
three-year-forward-three-
year-ahead horizon would imply an average 

inflation rate of 1.5% (t
aken at face value). On a 
longer horizon, the widely watched five-year-

forward-five-year-ahead indicator recovered 

strongly from its low point in January and at the 

time of writing, suggests an inflation of 1.7%, a 

level which minimises concerns about a possible 

de-anchoring of inflation expectations (see 

Graph I.39).

 The reversal in inflation expectations in early 2015 
is confirmed by survey-bas
ed measures. According 
to the Commission™s surveys, selling price 

expectations in both the retail and manufacturing 

sectors had fallen to troughs in January 2015, 

before picking up in February and March. The 

same pattern has been observed for consumers™ 

expectations of price trends over the next 

12 months (see also Box I.4). Survey-based 

measures of long-term infl
ation expectations such 
as the ECB™s Survey of 
Professional Forecasters 
suggest that inflation rates will gradually return to 

levels close to 2%. Thus, survey-based measures 

appear to have declined less than market-based 

measures. This could be interpreted as evidence 

that respondents did not recognise changes in the 

inflation process and continue with their historical 

practice of giving more weight to recent inflation 

data. 
(54)
 But it could also hint on the existence of 
negative inflation risk premia, 
(55) i.e. inflation 
swap rates and break-even 
inflation rates are lower 
than expected inflation rates, reflecting the view

  40 that the central scenario is
 surrounded by a higher 
likelihood for lower rather than higher inflation 

outcomes. 
–being in line with inflation gradually moving 
up over the forecast horizon– In 2015, the assumed path of commodity prices 
and the remaining slack
 in the economy are 
expected to be a drag on the inflation outlook. The 

steep decline in energy pr
ices since the second half 
of 2014 and the assumed path of oil prices will 

result in negative base effects in the HICP energy 

component in the first half of 2015, which are 

expected to outweigh the upward pressure the 

depreciation of the euro 
exerts on import prices. 
Later this year, the impact of low energy prices 

will gradually fade and the impact of the euro™s 

depreciation and the narrowing of the output gap 

are expected to lift the other HICP components. 

Overall, inflation rates are projected to be 

marginally below zero in
 the second quarter of 
2015 and to rebound towards 0.7% in the EU (see 

Graph I.2) and 0.6% in th
e euro area in the fourth 
quarter of 2015 (see Graph I.40), resulting in 

annual inflation rates of cl
ose to zero in both areas.

 In 2016, internal and exte
rnal sources of inflation 
should work in tandem to
 push inflation noticeably 
higher. The gradual increase in the assumed path 

for both energy and non-energy commodity prices 

should have the opposite effect on HICP inflation 

in 2016 thanks to positive base effects. Stronger 

wage growth, more robust domestic demand, and a 

low euro filtering into several imported consumer 

prices are set to feed into increasing underlying 

price pressures. Moreover, the ECB™s quantitative 

easing programme has reduced concerns of 

deflation risks and instead helped to anchor 

inflation expectations, while the ensuing monetary 
growth should support credit channels, activity, 
asset prices and general price levels. Headline 

inflation is projected to move up to 1.6% in the 

fourth quarter of 2016 in both regions, lifting 

annual inflation to 1.5% 
in both the euro area and 
in the EU.

Inflation dispersion, current euro area 
Member States
 In 2015, HICP inflation rates in the Member States 
are expected to range from -1.5% in Greece to 

1.3% in Malta. Among the seven largest Member 

States, rates vary from -0.6% in Spain and 0.4% in 

the UK. The difference in rates reflect several 

factors including GDP growth, wage growth 

pressures, convergence in price levels, and the 

different impact of exchange rate and commodity 

price movements, which depend on the 

composition of national HICPs and industrial 

structures. Another factor behind inflation differences are 
relative price adjustments within the euro area. In 

several stressed countries, external re-balancing 

required increases in price competitiveness that 

had to be achieved through a relative adjustment of 

prices. The observation that the largest gains in 

export performance among euro-area economies 

were last year observed in Ireland, Greece and 

Cyprus points to the strength of the rebalancing. 

As a result, not only producer prices, but also 

consumer prices increased
 slower than the euro-
area average. This is reflected in inflation 

dispersion that should help restore relative price 
EA and EU outlook 
  41 adjustment especially with
in the euro area but also 
across Member States. The low levels of euro area 

inflation make the continuation of this process 

more difficult and suggest that it will go on over 

the forecast horizon. 
8. PUBLIC FINANCES 
General government deficits continue to 
decline– The fiscal outlook is 
expected to continue 
improving in the EU and the euro area, backed by 

the gradual recovery in economic activity and 

lower interest payments on public debt. In 2014, 

the general government deficit has reached 2.9% 

and 2.4% of GDP in the EU and the euro area 

respectively. For the first time since 2008, the EU 

general government deficit has therefore turned out 

below the Treaty reference value of 3% of GDP. 
In the euro area, the non-standard monetary policy 
measures of the ECB are expected to have some 

impact on the fiscal out
look. These measures 
should exercise downward pressure on sovereign 

bond yields and provide some support to sovereign 

ratings. In effect, this could lead to budgetary 

savings owing to a decline in the implicit interest 

rates on government borrowing. In 2016, an 

additional positive effect may stem from the 

distribution of profits made by the Eurosystem on 

its sovereign debt holdings. Moreover, the re-

anchoring of inflation expectations should support 

lower general government deficit and debt ratios 

via a higher inflation outlook. Tax revenue would 

also be expected to indirectly benefit from the 

resulting pick-up in economic growth, mostly 

underpinned by stronger domestic demand, 

boosted asset prices and a weaker euro exchange 

rate, even if this effect might be somehow reduced 
by the impact on tax revenue of lower interest 
incomes. 
Overall, the general government deficit is expected 
to continue declining over the forecast horizon in 

both areas (see Graph I.42). In 2015, the general 

government deficit is projected to fall to 2.5% and 

2.0% of GDP in the EU and the euro area 

respectively. Under a no-policy-change 

assumption, the general government deficit is 

projected to decline to 2.0% and 1.7% of GDP in 

the EU and the euro area in 2016.

Breakdown of the change in the general government 
deficit in the euro area, 2015-16
 Following a substantial fiscal adjustment over the 
last few years, the fiscal policy stance, as measured 

by the change in the general government budget 

balance corrected for cycli
cal factors, one-offs and 
other temporary measures, has been broadly 

neutral in 2014 in the EU, while some further 

tightening is estimated for the euro area. The 

difference in the fiscal ad
justment between the EU 
and the euro area is explained by the sizeable 

deterioration in the struct
ural budget balance in 
some non-euro area Member States, in particular 

Bulgaria, Hungar
y, Sweden, the Czech Republic, 
the United Kingdom and Sweden. In 2015, the 

structural balance is proj
ected to remain roughly 
stable in the EU and the euro area, on account of 

lower interest payments more than compensating 

for the estimated deterioration in the structural 

primary balance.  
Notwithstanding the broadly neutral fiscal stance 
expected on aggregate in the EU and in the euro 

area in 2015, ther
e are considerable differences 
across Member States. As regards output 

stabilisation, a

effort in 2015, this is not always the case (see

 The revenue-to-GDP ratio in the EU peaked at 
45.4% of GDP in 2013 and is expected to 

gradually decrease over th
e forecast horizon as a 
result of lower net social contributions as a 

percentage of GDP. In the euro area, however, 

revenues have slightly increased in 2014 to 46.6% 

of GDP, largely due to broad-based higher 

revenues from indirect taxes as a result of stronger 

private consumption. The re
venue ratio in the euro 
area is set to stabilise in 2015 and decrease in 

2016, on the back of lowe
r net social contributions. 
In a number of countries, reforms to reduce the tax 

wedge on labour are expected to contribute to this 

effect and play a role in raising employment and 

supporting economic activity.

The expenditure-to-GDP ratio is projected to 
remain on a downward path in the EU over the 

forecast horizon, from 48.1%
 of GDP in 2014, to 
46.7% of GDP in 2016, mainly benefiting from 

cost-containment in public wages and the 

diminishing impact of automatic stabilisers as the 

economic recovery progresses. Similarly, the 

expenditure ratio is also se
t to decrease in the euro 
area, from 49.0% of GDP in 2014, to 48.0% of 

GDP in 2016. The estimated
 decrease results from 
declining interest payments, stemming from the 

accommodative monetary policy stance, lower 

social transfers due to th
e upswing in the business 
cycle, but also restraint in public wages and 

investment. Indeed, only in seven euro area

expand faster than nominal GDP growth over

–and public debt ratio set on a downward 
path. The non-consolidated debt-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to have peaked in 2014, reaching 88.6% 

and 94.2% in the EU
 and the euro area 
respectively. In the euro area, the smaller debt-

reducing effect stemming from lower inflation has 

been more than compensated by higher real GDP 

growth compared to 2013
, while the contribution 
of the primary balance has also somewhat 

improved (see Table I.7). Nevertheless, these debt-

reducing effects have been offset by the interest 

burden on the high debt load, so the debt ratio 

increased, despite the very low level of interest 

rates. The expected continued increase in the primary 
surplus, combined with the improved 

macroeconomic outlook and a more moderate 

debt-increasing impact from interest payments, is 

projected to set the debt ratio on a downward path 

in both areas in 2015, when the debt-to-GDP ratio 

is forecast to slightly decrease to 88.0% and 94.0% 

in the EU and the euro ar

the debt ratio is projected to continue declining in 

both areas, on the back of the projected pick-up in 

inflation, accelerati
ng economic activity and 
higher primary surpluses. 
9. RISKS 
Risks to the outlook appear broadly balanced. 

Some previously discussed risks have partly 

materialised and entered the main scenario (e.g. 

the stronger-than-expected 
depreciation of the euro 
and the faster rebound of oil prices) or appear to 

have diminished (de-anchoring inflation 

expectations). 
Risks to the growth outlook remain elevated 
but are broadly balanced– The link between the ECB™s ongoing QE and the 
external value of the euro has increased upward 

risks to the growth outlook 
that are associated with 
the technical exchange rate assumption (see 

Box I.5 for details), which should exceed the 

downside risks that would materialise should the 

euro appreciate. Geopolitical tensions are high on 
the agenda and risks asso
ciated with oil prices 
remain elevated, but they
 are also two-sided. 
Downside risks include: 
 Oil price developments.
 A faster-than-assumed 
rebound in oil prices 
could erase the windfall 
gains from lower energy prices, lower 

households™ real disposable incomes and 

negatively affect private consumption. It would 

also raise companies™ costs and thereby 

deteriorate their price competitiveness. 
 Geopolitical risks.
 Events in Ukraine and parts 
of the Middle East and Northern Africa could 
lead to an escalation of tensions and become an 

impediment to economic growth in Europe, by 

for instance, directly 
impacting energy and 
commodity markets and indirectly by 

hampering business and consumer confidence. 

Moreover, the economic impact of sanctions 

against Russia and Russia™s counter-sanctions 

could be larger than expected, in particular if 

they go on for longer than currently assumed. 
 Financial-market disruptions.
 Risks continue 
to surround the assumed normalisation of 

monetary policy outside the EU, notably in the 

US, which could trigger abrupt financial 

market responses, including capital outflows 

from emerging markets. Also, an increasing 

mismatch between the valuation of financial 

assets and their underlying fundamentals, or 

developments in Greece could trigger 

disruptions in financial markets. 
 Reform fatigue.
 Despite additional reforms 
implemented in some Member States in recent 
months, there is a risk that stronger economic 

growth may tempt governments to ease the 

pace of reform. A delay would also make the 

rotation of growth drivers from temporary 

tailwinds (oil price decline, euro depreciation, 

the fall in funding costs) towards 

fundamentally more sound growth 

determinants more difficult.  
On the upside, the most salient risks are: 
 Oil price developments.
 New developments in 
oil production or the market access of 

additional oil producers could delay the 

assumed rebound in oil prices and keep the oil-

price stimulus in the EU intact for longer than 

expected. Moreover, the boost from lower oil 
EA and EU outlook 
  45 prices could be stronger than currently 
expected. 
 The impact of the ECB™s QE.
 Companies™ 
decisions in the euro
 area may be more 
interest-rate sensitive than assumed in the 

central scenario and bank lending may react 

more strongly than projected, which would 

allow for a stronger imp
act of QE on the real 
economy than envisaged. QE could also trigger 

a continued depreciation of the euro, with 

positive effects on exports and growth that 

would go beyond developments expected under 

the technical exchange rate assumption.  
 Global growth acceleration.
 Stronger-than-
expected global growth would further support 
EU exports. The impetus from strong export 

growth to domestic demand could also prove 

stronger than expected. 
 Structural reforms.
 The positive impact of 
structural reforms on economic growth could 

set-in earlier than currently envisaged. 
 The Investment Plan for Europe.
 The cautious 
approach to incorpora
ting the impact of the 
Investment Plan for Europe may underestimate 

the positive impact on total investment growth 

in the EU. 
Overall, uncertainty around the growth outlook 
remains elevated, but risks appear to be broadly 

balanced. This is visualised in the fan chart (see 

Graph I.47) that depicts the probabilities 

associated with various 
outcomes for euro area 
economic growth over th
e forecast horizon. While 
the darkest area indicates the most likely 

development, the shaded areas represent the  
different probabilities of future economic growth 
within the growth ranges given on the y-axis. Due 

to the balanced composition of risks, the fan shows 

symmetric confidence interv
als around the central 
scenario.

Uncertainty linked to the balance of risks
 –whereas risks to the inflation outlook have 
fallen. With a key role in this forecast played by technical 
assumptions on exchange rates and oil prices, any 

deviation from their assumed paths have the 

potential to cause substantial deviations from the 

inflation forecast for the EU and the euro area. 

Such risks are two-sided. Other risks surrounding 

the inflation outlook have moderated as a result of 

the ECB™s quantitative easing and in response to 

the upward revisions to the growth outlook, 

notably the increase in domestic demand. This 

applies in particular to the risk of a substantial 

decline of longer-term in
flation expectations and 
of negative second-round effects on income 

stemming from a protracted period of very low or 

negative inflation. 
 
 European Economic Forecast, Spring 2015 
  46    Box I.1: 
Illustrative decomposition of the 2015 GDP forecast
The forecast for euro area GDP growth in 2015 is 
boosted by a conjunction of tailwinds. This box 
provides a rough quantification of the different 
factors affecting the growth outlook for this year 
based on simulations with the Commission's 
QUEST model. It should be noted however that the 
decomposition derived from the model is not 
necessarily identical with the impact of the same 
factors in the forecast, which incorporates expert 
judgement.  
In view of the interlinkages between growth 
drivers, any breakdown can only give a rough idea 

of the contribution of single factors and so is 
somewhat rudimentary and subject to large 
uncertainties. But it is indicative in that it 

highlights the positive tailwinds boosting euro area 
growth at the current juncture. Therefore, the 
growth decomposition reported here is purely 
illustrative.  
Potential euro area GDP growth is calculated at 
0.8% in 2015, according to the agreed EU 
methodology. Output growth is boosted beyond 
this by a number of positive shocks, most 

prominently the decline in oil prices and more 
ample monetary conditions, while the stance of 
fiscal policy in the euro area is broadly neutral. A 

negative impact stems from events in Ukraine and 
related tensions with Russia.  
Oil prices have fallen from USD 110 in June 2014 
to around USD 60 at present, while in euro terms 
the fall has been around 30%. Lower oil prices 
boost households' disposable incomes and reduce 
firms' costs. The assumption of an only moderate 
rebound in oil prices implies that the positive 
impact on economic activity will continue for the 
rest of the year. For the year as a whole, this factor 
can raise GDP growth by around half a percentage 
point. 
Looser monetary conditions comprise the impact of 
the ECB's recent 
non-standard policy measures on 
interest rates and their impact on the euro's 
exchange rate, taking into account the expected 

tightening of monetary policy in the US. In the  
simulations, quantitative easing affects euro area 
growth through a lower term premium, higher 
demand for riskier assets and via the exchange rate 
of the euro (cf. section I.1). The impact of QE on 
the euro's exchange rate cannot easily be 
disentangled from the exchange-rate impact of the 
less accommodative monetary policy expected in 
the US, reflecting the more advanced recovery, and 
from other factors that have affected investors' 
preferences. Together, these have driven the euro 

down by about 10% in effective terms since May 
2014. The effect of more accommodative monetary 
conditions is estimated to be a boost to euro area 

growth this year of around ¾ pps. By increasing 
inflation expectations and thus preventing an 
unwarranted increase in real interest rates, QE has 

also accentuated the positive impact of the oil price 
fall on the economy. 
(1)
  On the negative side, geopolitical tensions relating 
to Ukraine and the ensuing imposition of sanctions 
on Russia have had an impact on confidence and 
also some direct impact on trade, investment and 
on financial markets. 
(2) 
These tensions are 
estimated to lower growth by around ¼ pps in 

2015.  
The remaining residual of -0.4% reflects a variety 
of factors. On the downside they include the legacy 
of the crisis, ongoing deleveraging pressures and 
elevated uncertainty in the euro area. On the 

upside, the residual covers factors such as the 
acceleration of global growth and world trade, and 
calendar effects.

monetary policy constrained at the zero-lower-bound

  47    Box I.2: 
Corporate lending prospects in the euro area Member States
 Bank lending to non-financial corporations (NFCs) 
in the euro area has been weak for the last few 
years because adjustments in the banking system 
curtailed the supply of credit and because the 
weakness of the economy and the need to 
deleverage reduced NFCs demand for credit. 
Nevertheless, the Comprehensive Assessment of 
the banking system carried out by the ECB last 
year showed that banks are well capitalised. 
Since the announcement and implementation of the 
ECB™s expanded asset purchase program (APP), 
the cost of capital has declined and there has been 
an improvement in non-price credit terms. At the 
same time, improved cyclical prospects have led to 
higher demand for credit. Historical experience 
suggests that credit volumes tend to lag the 
business cycle and that although quantitative easing 
(QE) tends to influence financial prices rather 
quickly, its impact on lending volumes takes time 
to become apparent. 
(1)
 Moreover, QE is likely to 
be more effective in stimulating corporate lending 

if deleveraging pressures are no longer weighing on 
credit demand and supply. 
Credit developments in individual countries have 
been quite different (see Graph 1) and have mainly 
followed the adjustment needs of the corporate and 
banking sectors in the aftermath of the financial 
crisis. 
(2)
 Consistent with the notion that lending has 
been weak over the last few years because of 
deleveraging, corporate credit growth has been 
weaker in those countries where it had increased by

most prior to the financial crisis, such as Ireland, 
Spain and Portugal. This can also be seen in the 
evolution of credit to GDP ratios in Graph 2 and by 
the fact that changes in corporate saving ratios have 
been greatest in those countries where the ratios 
had been particularly low before 2008 (e.g. Spain, 
Italy, and Portugal). Differences in the scale of 
deleveraging by the banking sector are also broadly 
consistent with bank lending volumes, across the 
euro area. 
This box highlights a number of economic 
variables that help to explain how the economies of 
the euro area have adjusted to deleveraging 

pressure. The more countries have adjusted, the 
more they should be able to benefit from QE. 
Looking at adjustments in both the corporate and 

the banking sector should help to determine 
whether credit volumes have been curtailed by 
demand and/or supply factors. For example, 

structural sectoral changes may have led to a 
permanently lower reliance of the economy on 
bank lending. At the same time, legacy assets from 
the crisis that banks still hold on their balance 
sheets may still be impairing their ability to provide 
new credit. 
Lending and adjustment in the corporate sector 
The sectoral structures of economies have a strong 

influence on their corporate sectors™ overall 
reliance on bank lending (see Graph 3). The 
manufacturing sector is less reliant on bank lending 
than other sectors. Industrial firms, by generating 
relatively stable revenues from their sales, are 
better able to fund themselves internally and rely 
therefore less on external funding. By contrast, 
construction firms are often facing one-off projects, 
which need external financing.

  Credit intensity Œ expressed either as bank credit 
relative to value added or to total assets Œ has 
declined across sectors, but more so in those 
sectors that are more reliant on bank lending, such 
as construction. The calculations in Table 1 show 
that sectoral changes, such as the shrinkage of 
credit-intensive sectors explain only part of the 
decline in bank lending since 2008 (see Graph 4). 
Although this effect is pronounced in countries like 

Spain and Portugal which had relatively large 
credit-intensive construction sectors before the 
crisis, it is less evident elsewhere. In Germany, 
which has a strong manufacturing sector but a 
relatively less important construction sector, for 
example, there, have been no significant sectoral 
adjustments since 2008. The difference between the 
actual (Table 1, 1
st row) and simulated effects (2
nd and 3
rd row) indicates that bank lending has 
declined more than the sectoral adjustments alone 
would suggest. 
    An important determinant of bank reliance, not 
fully covered by the sectoral decomposition, is the 
share of SMEs in an economy. As SMEs tend to 

have no access to capital markets and rely solely on 
bank lending for their external funding, a higher 
share of value added from SMEs in total GDP leads 
to a higher dependency on bank lending. In 
countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy, SMEs 
play a significantly larger-than-average role. The 
smaller share of larger firms in these countries 
impacts their ability to substitute bank lending for 
market funding. Research confirms that the 
development of corporate bond markets is 
correlated with the share of large firms in an 
economy, as well as other factors such as GDP per 
capita, labour productivity growth and openness. 
Indeed, access to corporate bond markets has 
improved in those countries where bond issuance 
was already high before the crisis. 
(3) 
Table 2 reports key indicators of the corporate 
sector™s reliance on bank lending, relative to the 
euro area average in selected Member States. 
(4)
 The last column summarizes the information into a 
composite index of relative reliance on bank 
lending. Based on this unweighted average of the 
four indicators in Table 2, Spain and Italy still seem 
significantly more dependent on bank lending than 
other euro area countries. By contrast, bank 
dependency is no longer particularly high in those 

countries that had been exposed to weak credit 
growth such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal. After 
years of adjustment, several countries have reduced 
their previously very high dependency on banks 
thanks to a sectoral shift and higher corporate 
savings.

issuance over the last years was much higher in 
Portugal than predicted by the country's starting 
position before the financial crisis.

  Lending and adjustment in the banking sector 
Besides the structural changes in the corporate 
sector, the prospects of a rebound in the lending 

cycle crucially depend on how the banking sector 
has digested the legacies of the crisis and adapted 
to the new regulatory environment. It equally 

depends on banks' responsiveness to ECB's QE. 
While QE is likely to have a positive overall impact 
on euro area banks, it remains unclear whether this 

positive impact will be translated into higher 
lending to households and companies. Three 
indicators relating to lending capacity help to shed 

light on the pace of adjustment in the banking 
sector and its ability to expand lending to the 
corporate sector (see Graph 5). 
First, the capital buffer of banks indicates their 
capacity to withstand loan losses and/or to provide 

more loans while remaining within regulatory 
boundaries. 
(5)
 Capital buffers can also determine 
the capacity of banks to replace zero-risk-weight 

sovereign bonds with lending to the private sector, 
for which regulatory capital must be held. The 
higher the capital buffer, the better the potential 

transmission of the ECB's purchase of sovereign 
bonds under its QE policy to lending to the private 
non-financial sector. 
Second, non-performing loans (NPL) are a key 
metric not only for corporate debt distress, but also 

as a credit supply indicator. Banks usually lend less 
and at higher interest rates when NPLs are high or 
rising. The level of NPLs may therefore partly 

explain the current differences in lending rates and 
volumes.  
                                                           
(5)
 The capital buffer used in Graph 5 is defined as 
banks' total own funds for solvency purposes relative 
to ca
pital re
quirements. 
Third, the profitability of banks deteriorated during 
the financial crisis and they have had to scrutinise 
the viability of their business model. The success of 
their restructuring efforts should ultimately be 
visible in a rebound of profitability.  
When compared against the euro area average, 
these indicators point to relatively weaker banking 

sectors in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. NPLs 
in these countries have risen by more than the euro 
area average since 2010 and capital buffers in these 

countries are also below the euro area average. 
Moreover, returns on assets are lower, suggesting 
that structural changes in their banking sectors are 
still ongoing. Overall, this suggests that the 
banking systems in these countries will find it 
harder to provide lending to the private sector.  
The French banking system has relatively low 
capital buffers but it does not need to cover rising 

levels of distressed loans. The indicators for 
Germany look particularly favourable with higher-
than-average capital buffers and a better-than-

average evolution of NPLs. 
Synthesis and conclusions 
Averaging the different indicators of bank reliance 

in the corporate sector on the one hand, and of 
progress with adjustment in the banking sector on 
the other hand can help identify Member States that 
could benefit most from the favourable 
development on financial markets (see Graph 6). 
Countries with a high reliance on bank lending but 

whose banks have only limited lending capacity 
such as Italy and to a lesser extend Spain, are in a 
rather uncomfortable situation (NW quadrant in 

Graph 6). Greece and Portugal have banking 
systems with limited space to increase credit supply 
but their corporate sectors are less reliant on bank 

lending than other euro area countries. Finally, 
although Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and 
Finland have banks with relatively large lending 

capacities, demand for cred
it appears more limited 
(SE quadrant in Graph 6).  
Overall, the presence of legacy issues from the 
financial crisis may impair the transmission of the 
positive impulse set by QE to bank lending. 

Countries in which the adjustment in the banking 
sector is more advanced should be better positioned 
to make use of the additional liquidity provided by 

QE to banks. Countries, in which corporate 
deleveraging is still on going, may encounter a

 limited demand for bank lending even if QE leads 
to more favourable financing conditions and higher 
aggregate demand. Whether QE is more effective 
when corporates' reliance on bank lending is low 
seems to depend on the reasons for the low 

reliance. If it is due to corporates making stronger 
use of market funding, such as corporate bond 
issuance, QE can be very effective, as the costs of 

bond issuance have come down considerably. The 
impact could, however, be limited if firms reacted 
to past credit constraints by intensifying their use of 
internal funding, e.g. funding their investments 
with own revenues, because they want to avoid 
reliance on external funding sources.

Rebalancing in the euro area: an update
Current accounts in a majority of euro area 
countries are now close to balance or in surplus. As 
shown in Table 1, current account deficits 
exceeding 1
% of GDP in 2015 are foreseen only in 
Greece, Cyprus and Latvia. The euro area should 
register a record surplus of 3.5% of GDP in 2015, 
which is in value (about EUR 360 billion) one of 
the largest in the world. In light of their output 
gaps, which are larger than those of their 
competitors, Ireland, the Baltics and Malta exhibit 

bigger current account surpluses if adjusted for the 
cyclical component, while the opposite holds for 
Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Slovakia. For the 

remaining euro area Member States, cyclical 
factors play a minor role in determining present 
current account figures. 
Current account balances improved substantially 
since the start of the financial crisis, with double-
digit improvements recorded in the current 
account/GDP ratio of broadly half the euro area 
Member States, namely those that had sizable 

deficits in the late 2000s. As for the countries that 
recorded surpluses at the start of the crisis, only 
those of Germany and the Netherlands have grown. 
Current account improvements in deficit countries 
since the start of the crisis are only partly explained 
by cyclical developments, since the output 
contraction in these countries was largely 
accompanied by reduced potential output. 
(1) 
In Germany, by contrast, cyclical developments have 
worked towards reducing th
e surplus, but this has 
been overwhelmed by an increase in the non-

cyclical component of the German surplus.
 (2)
 Two broad phases can be distinguished in the 
rebalancing process since the financial crisis. The 
first phase largely coincided with market-driven 
sudden stops and reversals of large current 
account 
deficits and the deterioration of public finances, 
which, in some cases, was followed by tensions in 
government bond markets and fiscal consolidation 
measures. The second phase started in the second

. half of 2012 and was characterised by easing 
financial market tensions, falling spreads, and a 
reduced pace of fiscal consolidation. 
 As shown in Table 1, starting from 2013, current 
account improvements in countries that started with 

large deficits has continued at a much slower pace, 
stopped, or even reversed. The improvement in the 
output gaps of these countries imply that the 

deterioration of current account balances was 
largely due to the beginning recovery of the 
business cycle. Over the same period, however, the 
euro area™s surplus increased rapidly to more than 
3.3% of GDP, mainly due to dynamics in the 
largest Member States. In Italy, declining demand 
as a result of weak growth led to a substantial 
improvement in the current account balance. 
Germany™s surplus increased further due to muted 
corporate investment, which offset a slight 
improvement in household demand. By contrast, 
the narrowing of France™s current account deficit 

was led by lower construction investment. In all 
three countries, current account improvements were 
mainly due to developments in the private sector, 

but also helped by a tightened fiscal stance. 
In light of the strong contraction of domestic 
demand during the early phase of adjustment, 
current account improvements in deficit countries 
were to a large extent linked to reduced imports 
(see Graph 1), although this trend has recently 
reversed somewhat. Regarding exports, with the 
exception of Ireland, growth was relatively 

subdued or even negative before 2012, and the

  52  Box (continued) 
 positive contribution to current account dynamics 
was due the fact that GDP growth remained below 

export growth. Export growth resumed after 2012 
and has since been by far the strongest determinant 
of current account improvements in most countries. 

The contribution of exports to current account 
changes over the 2012-15 period was stronger in 
most countries than in the 2007-12 period. 

Moreover, declining oil prices in 2014 contributed 
to the improvement through terms-of-trade effects. 
 The different role played by domestic demand 
during rebalancing can be gauged from Graph 2, 
which disentangles different components of the 
savings-investment balance in selected euro area 

economies. The early phase of rebalancing was 
largely driven by the contraction of private 
domestic demand components across the board. 

Private investment contracted in most countries, 
notably those running large current account 
deficits. The contraction was particularly 

pronounced in construction investment. 
Private consumption generally contributed to 
current account improvements as well: its share of 
GDP fell, considerably in countries such as Spain 
and Ireland. The contribution of government 

savings by contrast was negative because of the 
recession-driven deterioration in fiscal balances. 
The picture changes substantially in more recent 
years. Investment stopped providing a positive 

contribution to current account dynamics, not only 
because of the stabilisation in construction 
investment, but also because of the recovery in 

non-construction investment in countries such as 
Ireland, Spain and Portugal. While the productive 
investment recovery has had a negative effect on 

recent current account dynamics in these countries, 
it should create the basis for a stronger tradable 
sector in the future. The recovery in consumption 

implied deteriorating current account balances in 
most countries, apart from Italy, where declining 
consumption was a major driver of current account 

developments. Conversely, progress in fiscal 
consolidation has translated into current account 
improvements, with considerable gains recorded in 

Greece and Spain. It is unlikely that a similar 
positive contribution by the government sector to 
current account dynamics would be maintained in 

the coming years.  
Despite current account positions having moved 
close to balance or in surplus in most euro area 
countries, stock external imbalances remain high, 
as revealed by Net International Investment 

Positions (see Table 2). After years of major 
deteriorations, the Net International Investment 
Position (NIIP) of most countries with large stocks 

of net foreign liabilities is stabilising, but progress 
towards a more prudent position remains minor,

  53  Box (continued) 
 while the NIIP of countries with largely positive 
positions such as Germany and the Netherlands has 
been growing for years. At present, on the basis of 
the forecast for potential growth and inflation, 
current account positions expressed in cyclically-
adjusted terms are above the levels required to 
stabilise the NIIP in almost all euro area countries, 
in particular in the former deficit countries (with 
the exceptions of Greece and Cyprus). However, 
more prudent current account balances may be 
required in some cases to ensure a satisfactory pace 
of reducing net foreign liabilities. As a benchmark, 
achieving a NIIP/GDP ratio of -35
% over a  
10-year period would require medium-term current 
account improvements in Greece, Cyprus, Spain, 
and Portugal. 
     Once the rebalancing process in the euro area has 
run its course, countries with large net foreign 
liabilities will need to maintain sufficient current 
account surpluses. The su
ccess of policies put in 
place by the ECB and a domestic demand recovery 
in core euro area countries should contribute 
towards this end. Rebalancin
g will be com
patible 
with a recovery in potential growth in net debtor 
countries provided that growth is sufficiently 
export-driven. For this to happen, the necessary 
shift from non-tradable to tradable activities needs 
to continue in these economies. As shown in 
Graph 3, while this shift has started only recently in 
Greece, it appears to have peaked in Ireland and 
Spain, and reversed in countries that went through 
current account rebalancing at an earlier stage, like 
Latvia. Price and cost competitiveness gains would 
help such a shift, but developments in REER 
indicate that competitiveness improvements since 
2013 have slowed down in countries like Spain and 
Portugal. The major slowdown in inflation 
recorded in competitor countries since 2014 is also 
reducing the extent of competitiveness gains in 
Greece and Cyprus. 
Rebalancing should also be helped by structural 
reforms. In countries with large stocks of foreign 
liabilities, further structural reforms should raise 
productivity growth and facilitate the reallocation 
of capital and labour toward exporting firms. 
However, the scope for exports also depends on 
external demand. Weak demand in the core euro 
area implies that debtor countries have to focus 
relatively more on dampening import demand 
rather than expanding exports in order to reduce 
their net external liabilities. For the relatively 
closed economies in the euro area™s south, that 
would weigh on GDP growth, which in turn would 
require higher current account surpluses to narrow 
the NIIP as a share of GDP. Conversely, structural 
reforms to reinvigorate domestic demand and 
growth in surplus countries would also help to ease 
the debt burden in the euro area periphery, not only 
by increasing demand for exports, but by raising 
euro area inflation closer to 2%. 
In the external debtor countries, structural reforms 
should also improve attractiveness to foreign direct 
investment, which offers an alternative route

What do survey data tell us about future price developments?
Inflation today is low by historical standards in 
most advanced economies. Survey-based data on 
price expectations provide timely information on 
current developments but can also signal future 
developments. As expectations that prices will fall 
in the future could lower current inflation, e.g. by 
encouraging consumers to delay purchases until 
prices fall, it is important to carefully monitor 
various measures of price expectations.
 Against this background, this box explores the 
usefulness of qualitative survey data for monitoring 
price developments in the EU and the euro area and 

investigates whether inflation, after years of 
decline, has bottomed out or started to recover. 
Two main sets of survey data are analysed: the first 

consists in data that can detect price pressure at an 
early stage of price formation, such as managers™ 
selling price expectations. The second set includes 

data on consumer price expectations, which could 
reveal whether the recent decline in consumer-price 
inflation (as measured by the HICP) has had an 
impact on inflation expectations.
 Price pressures along the supply chain 
Producer prices are of particular interest since they 
can help to identify price pressures at an early stage 
of the value chain that could subsequently be 
passed on to finished goods and hence consumers. 
Two sorts of data are used to check the information 
contained in survey data with regard to future 
producer price developments: the business surveys 
conducted by the European Commission in the 
framework of the Harmonised Business and 
Consumer surveys (BCS) and Markit Economics™ 
PMI. 
Question 6 of the European Commission™s monthly 
Industry Survey 
(1)
 reads: ‚How do you expect your 
selling prices to change over the next three months? 

They will increase, remain unchanged or decrease™. 
As the question relates to manufacturing, the 
assessment is made against the Producer Price 

Index for the manufacturing sector, which 
represents 84
% of ‚total industry excluding 
construction™ in both the EU and the euro area. 
Graph 1 demonstrates the close co-movement of 
selling price expectations
 and producer prices. 
After a period of relative stabilisation in early

 . 2014, both series were on a downward trend in 
November, following the oil price decreases 
registered since mid-2014, and picked up in 
February 2015. In March, selling price expectations 
increased further in both the EU and the euro area. 
Markit Economics™ PMI survey asks managers 
about their buying (input) prices and the prices they 
charge for their goods (output prices). Graph 2 
shows PMI input and output prices along with year-

on-year changes of producer prices, again testifying 
a close co-movement between the series. Focusing 
on the most recent developments, while PMI output 

prices have been fluctuating around a level of 50 
between mid-2012 and mid-2014, which represents 
stable producer prices, they registered an important 

decline from November 2014 to January 2015. In 
line with the European 
Commission™s survey 
results, PMI output prices picked up in February 
and March, rising above the threshold of 50 for the 
euro area, thus indicating easing deflationary 
pressure.

  The visual inspection is corroborated by correlation 
analysis, which indicates that selling price 
expectations and PMI input and output price 

developments track producer prices in the 
manufacturing sector quite closely (see Graph 3). 
Correlations with year-on-year producer price 
changes achieve their maximum in a coincident or 
slightly leading (1 month) set-up, suggesting some 
leading properties for survey-based measures of 

selling price expectations (‚m™ and ‚m-1™ on the 
horizontal axis of the graph). In line with the 
theoretical leading behaviour in the supply chain, 

the PMI series on input prices shows a higher 
degree of correlation with the PPI when 
considering lags from one to four months (‚m-1™ to 

‚m-4™). The question about selling price 
expectations also features in the European 
Commission™s services, retail trade and 

construction surveys. As shown in Graph 4, the 
trend of these series, albeit at different levels, is 
rather similar to that observed in the manufacturing 
sector. 
Concerning recent developments, selling price 
expectations in the services sector have been see-
sawing around a stabilising trend since the 
beginning of 2014. 
Expectations about prices charged in the EU 
construction sector have been on a volatile upward 
path since April 2013, while in the euro area the 

series has shown a rather flat development. Finally,

EA and EU outlook 
  57  Box (continued) 
 changes of the harmonised index of consumer 
prices (HICP) Š have been on an upward trend 
since the end of 2014, mostly offsetting the 
decreases observable during the second half of 
2014. 
All in all, though manufacturing managers™ selling 
price expectations and PMI input and output prices 

remain at relatively low levels, the latest increases 
suggest a bottoming out of price expectations. This 
is supported by the development of selling price 

expectations in the other business sectors that have 
either fluctuated around rather stable levels or seen 
slight upward revisions lately. 
Inflation expectations 
A second set of survey-based data is directly linked 

to consumer price developments. 
The European Commission™s consumer survey is 
qualitative and covers short-term inflation 

expectations. The ECB™s quantitative Survey of 
Professional Forecasters (SPF) focuses on both 
short- and long-term expectations. The target 

population of these two surveys differs (consumers 
vs. professional forecasters). A third measure of 
inflation expectations is based on financial market 
products. 
As shown in Graph 5, prior to the introduction of 
euro notes and coins in January 2002, there was a 
close relationship between consumer inflation 
expectations and actual inflation developments, 
with a correlation above 0.9. The close co-
movement between the two series was disturbed by 
the changeover, but became stronger again from the 
beginning of 2008.
(2)
 Since early 2014, inflation 
expectations have been declining again, in line with 
HICP inflation developments. Although euro area 

HICP inflation is at the same level as in 2009 (and 
at a lower level in the EU), the current level of 
inflation expectations is well above the historical 

low reached in 2009. In addition, the latest results 
show a slight increase in consumer inflation 
                                                           
(2) In both the EU and the euro area the highest 
correlations between consumer price expectations 
and measured HICP is achieved in a coincident set 
up. For more information of the predictive power of 
inflation expectations, see Jonung, L. and Lindén, S. 
(2010), ‚The forecasting horizon of inflationary 

expectations and perceptions in the EU Is it really 12 
months?™ 
European Economy - Economic Paper 
No 435
. expectations (in line with the pick-up registered in 
HICP inflation in February and March 
(3)). 
A disaggregate analysis of the evolution of 
inflation expectations over time also suggests that 
the present situation is different from the one 

observed in 2009, when a short period of negative 
inflation occurred in the euro area. Contrary to 
developments in 2009, the share of consumers 

expecting prices to fall has increased only 
marginally since 2011 and has remained very low 
(see Graph 6). This argues against additional 

deflationary pressures coming from consumers 
waiting for further price decreases. The only visible 
changes are an upward trend in the share of 
consumers expecting prices to remain broadly 
unchanged, and a decrease in the share of 
respondents expecting prices to increase more 
rapidly or at the same rate. 
Overall, developments in consumer price 
expectations Š at least for the short-term Š do not 
point to a risk of ‚self-fulfilling™ dynamics which 
could eventually pull down inflation. 
The quarterly ECB Survey of Professional 
Forecasters (SPF) collects information about 

forecasts for euro area HICP inflation one, two and 
five years ahead. In addition to the quantitative 
estimation of expected inflation, forecasters are 

asked to provide a probability distribution for

 Standard measures of forecast performance, such as 
the root mean square error, show that SPF forecasts 
are more accurate than naïve forecasts based on 
inflation rates for the most recent past.  
The latest SPF (2015Q2) indicates inflation 
expectations at 0.1
% for 2015, 1.2
% for 2016 and 
1.6
% for 2017. Inflation forecasts were revised 
down for 2015, owing to oil price developments, 
but up for 2016 and 2017, supported by monetary 
policy measures and exchange rate developments. 
Compared with the previous SPF round, the 
aggregate probability distribution for expected 
inflation in 2015 moved further towards lower 
outcomes, while for 2016 and 2017, the probability 
associated with higher outcomes has increased. The 
most likely (modal) outcome lies in the 0.0-0.4
% range for 2015, in the 1.0-1.4
% range for 2016 and 
in the range of 1.5-1.9
% for 2017. According to 
survey participants, the probability of negative 
inflation in 2015 is now rather high (35
%), whilst 
for 2016 and 2017 it remains low (5
% and 2
%, 
respectively). Longer-term inflation expectations 
have remained unchanged at 1.8
% compared to the 
previous SPF survey. This confirms that longer-
term inflation expectations of professional 
forecasters remain firmly anchored at levels 
consistent with the ECB™s definition of price 
stability. 
                                                           
(4)
 The panel comprises more than 70 forecasters located 
across the EU. Around 60
% of the SPF panel are 
participants from the financial sector (mainly banks), 
while the remainder are non-financial research 
institutes, employers™ associations and labour 
organisations. 
Market-based inflation expectations 
Marked-based inflation expectations have the 
advantage of providing information over a longer-
term horizon; on the downside, they might be 
distorted by unobservable risk and liquidity 
premia. 
(5)
 Market-based inflation expectations are most 
commonly analysed by break-even inflation rates 
and inflation-linked swap rates. 
Break-even inflation rates Š derived from German 
government bonds of maturity five years ahead Š 
have overcome the lows recorded in early January 
(below zero) and currently stand at 0.85
% (see 
Graph 7). Having increased steadily since mid-
February, they suggest that the decline of 
expectations was largely driven by temporary 
factors and that fears of deflationary pressure have 
reduced recently. 
This trend is confirmed by the evolution of 
inflation-linked swaps for a wide range of 
maturities, from which a euro area inflation curve 
can be drawn. Market-based short-term inflation 

expectations have recovered from the troughs they 
reached in January (see Graph 8). 
Long-term swap-based inflation expectations also 
bottomed out in January at historical lows and 
recovered slightly afterwards. Having fluctuated 
around its long-term average of 2.3
% for most of 
2013, the 5-year forward five-years ahead implied 
rate declined in 2014. Currently it is hovering 
around 1.7
%, slightly lower than the ECB™s SPF 
(2015Q1) results.

  59   Box (continued) 
 Overall, market-based measures of inflation 
expectations bottomed out in January 2015 and 
have since recovered somewhat. Current very low 
swap-based inflation expectations can also be 
partly explained by the fall in inflation risk or 
liquidity premia. In any case, they indicate positive 
inflation rates later this year. Moreover, long-term 
inflation expectations point to increasing inflation 
rates over the coming years. 
Conclusions 
Survey data on managers™ selling price 

expectations and consumers™ inflation expectations 
provide useful short-term information on the 
evolution of prices along the supply chain to final 
consumer prices. 
Though clearer signs of long-lasting upward 
revisions have to be confirmed in the next months, 
the February and March results of the European 
Commission™s manufacturing selling price 
expectations and Markit Economics™ PMI input and 
output prices suggest that the downward trend has 
bottomed out and that there are signs of recovering 

prices along the supply chain. Signs of a break in 
the downward trend of producer prices are broad-
based across business sectors, especially in retail 

trade, where selling price expectations have 
increased recently. 
Concerning inflation expectations, the analysis 
shows that consumers do not seem to expect 
inflation to fall further. SPF results indicate that 
HICP inflation should remain positive, although 
low, in 2015. This is co
nsistent with financial 
market-based measures of inflation expectations 
that point to positive inflat
ion rates later this year. 
These results are in line with the Commission™s 
spring forecast, which foresees low but gradually 
positive HICP inflation rates in the second half of 
2015.

  60    Box I.5: 
Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut-off date for taking new information into 
account in this European Economic Forecast was 
21 April. The forecast incorporates validated 
public 
finance data as published in Eurostat's News 
Release 72/2015 of 21 April 2015. 
External assumptions 
This forecast is based on a set of external 

assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the 
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions 
from possible volatility during any given trading 

day, averages from a 10-day reference period 
(between 6 and 17 April) were used for exchange 
and interest rates, and for oil prices.  
Exchange and interest rates 
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates 

was standardised using fixed nominal exchange 

rates for all currencies. This technical assumption 
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.08 
in 2015 and 1.07 2016. The average JPY/EUR is 

129.73 in 2015 and 128.30 in 2016. 
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. Short-
term interest rates for the euro area are derived 
from futures contracts. Long-term interest rates for 
the euro area, as well as short- and long-term 

interest rates for other Member States are 
calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the current spread between the 

interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no 
market instrument is available, the fixed spread 
vis-à-vis the euro area interest rate is taken for both 

short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term 
interest rates are assumed to be 0.0% on average in 
2015 and in 2016 in the euro area. Long-term euro 
area interest rates are assumed to be 0.2% on 
average in 2015 and 0.3% in 2016. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity price assumptions are also mostly 

based on market conditions. According to futures 
markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to be on 

average 59.4 USD/bbl in 2015 and 66.0 USD/bbl in 
2016. This corresponds to an oil price of 
54.8 EUR/bbl in 2015 and 61.7 EUR/bbl in 2016. 
Budgetary data  
Data up to 2014 are based on data notified by 
Member States to the European Commission before 

1 April 2015 and are validated by Eurostat. The 
notification is based on the ESA 2010 system of 
national accounts. 
Eurostat is expressing a reservation on the quality 
of the data reported by Bulgaria in relation to the 
sector classification of the Deposit Insurance Fund 
and the impact on the government deficit of the 
fund's repayment of the guaranteed deposits (3.7 bn 
BGN) in the Corporate Commercial Bank. The 
impact of the transaction will be assessed by 

Eurostat in cooperation with the Bulgarian 
statistical authorities during the coming months. 
This will most likely result in an increase of the 

government deficit.  
Eurostat is also expressing a reservation on the 
quality of the data reported by Portugal in relation 
to the capitalisation of Novo Banco. In the third 
quarter of 2014, the Portuguese Resolution Fund 

injected 4.9 bn euro (2.8% of GDP) into Novo 
Banco. In this EDP notification, the transaction has 
provisionally been recorded by the Portuguese 

authorities as a financial transaction for its full 
amount (due to lack of information) without any 
impact on the government deficit. The final impact 

of the transaction will be assessed by Eurostat in 
cooperation with the Portuguese statistical 
authorities during the coming months following the 
outcome of the privatisation process of Novo 
Banco and the final amount which the Portuguese 
government will obtain from the sale. This will 

most likely result in an increase of the government 
deficit. 
Eurostat has made no amendments to the data 
reported by Member States.
 For the forecast, measures in s
upport of financial 
stability have been recorded in line with the 
Eurostat Decision of 15 July 2009. 
(1) 
Unless 
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned, 
capital injections known in sufficient detail have 
been included in the forecast as financial 

transactions, 
i.e.
 increasing the debt, but not the 
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and 
deposits are not included as government 

expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have 
been called on at the time the forecast was 
finalised. Note, however, that loans granted to 

banks by the government, or by other entities 
classified in the government sector, usually add to 
government debt.

EA and EU outlook 
  61   
 Box (continued) 
 For 2015, the budgets adopted by the national 
parliaments and all other measures credibly 

announced and specified in sufficient detail are 
taken into consideration. For 2016, the 'no-policy-
change' assumption used in the forecasts implies 

the extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends 
and the inclusion of measures that are credibly 
announced and specified in sufficient detail. 
European aggregates for general government debt 
in the forecast years 
2015-16 are published on a 
non-consolidated basis (i.e. not corrected for 
intergovernmental loans). To ensure consistency in 
the time series, historical data are also published on 

the same basis. For 2014, this implies a debt-to-
GDP ratio in the euro area (EA19) which is 2.3 pps. 
(1.8 pps. in the EU) higher than the consolidated 

general government debt ratio published by 
Eurostat in its news release 72/2015 of 21 April 
2015. General government debt projections for 
individual Member States in 2015-16 include the 
impact of guarantees to the EFSF, 
(2) 
bilateral loans 
to other Member States, and the participation in the  

capital of the ESM as planned on the cut-off date of 
the forecast.

The current forecast is based on the ESA 2010 
system of national accounts for all Member States, 

the EU and the euro area aggregates.  
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output 
gaps The number of working days may differ from one 
year to another. The Commission's annual GDP 
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of 

working days, but quarterly forecasts are. 
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the 
euro area is estimated to be limited over the 
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and 
unadjusted annual growth rates differ only 

marginally (by up to ±0.1 pps.). The calculation of 
potential growth and the output gap does not adjust 
for working days. Since the working-day effect is 

considered as temporary, it should not affect the 
cyclically-adjusted balances. 
   PART II Prospects by individual economy 
   Member States   1. BELGIUM 
Subdued domestic demand prevents clear acceleration 
 66 Belgium™s economy grew by 1% in 2014. At 1.1%, 
GDP growth in 2015 is expected to be similar, and 

to reach 1.5% in 2016. Th
is relatively flat profile 
reflects the combination of hesitant private 

consumption, a correction of investment after a 

boom in 2014 and the stable positive contribution 

of net exports to overall growth. Risks to the 

forecast scenario are tilted to
 the upside in case of 
more resilient household consumption in the face 

of low wage growth and a more dynamic than 

anticipated labour mark
et improvement.

Graph II.1.1:
Belgium -Real GDP growth and contributions
 Limited wage growth weakens outlook for 
household consumption Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.2% 
this year before slowing down in 2016. Modest 

labour income growth is being counterbalanced by 

growth in financial income, certain tax measures 

and low price pressures so that real disposable 

income should still rise by 1.4% in 2015. While 

inflation is forecast to pi
ck up over the forecast 
horizon, it is not projected to put upward pressure 

on wages. Traditional transmission channels are 

being stifled following the temporary suspension 

of automatic wage indexation and the narrow 

margin for nominal wage increases. As a result, 

real disposable income growth is estimated to slow 

down to 0.3% in 2016 with private consumption 

growing by 0.9%. 
Competitiveness measures set to materialise 
slowly in employment, investment and exports Recent competitiveness-enhancing measures affect 
the projections in several ways. On top of the 

strategy of sustained wage moderation, the authori-

ties have been reducing employer social security 

contributions. An important additional tranche 

takes effect next year. While this provides support 

to private job creation, employment growth is 

forecast to remain unspectacular against the 

background of a slow economic turnaround and 

reductions in public employment.  
Investment was heavily skewed by large, one-off 
transactions in 2014. As a consequence, invest-

ment growth is projected to be flat this year. Aided 

by lower energy costs, modest labour cost growth 

should contribute towards higher profit margins. 

Together with rising capacity utilisation, easy 

financing conditions and a strengthening external 

environment, this brightens the outlook for 

corporate investment in 2016. As a result, capital 

formation is estimated to become an important 

contributor to GDP growth next year. 
As their cost competitiveness improves, Belgian 
exporters are expected
 to benefit from the 
acceleration of global trade, also helped by a 

weaker euro exchange rate. Notwithstanding the 

rise in imports due to the strength of investment 

growth, net exports still added 0.4 pps. to total 

GDP growth last year. Co
mparable contributions 
are forecast for this and next year.  
Negative inflation coming to an end  Headline inflation turned negative in recent 

months on the back of retreating energy prices. 

Price pressures appear close to a trough as 

temporary tax factors fade
, a weaker euro exerts 
upward pressure on import 
prices, the year-on-year impact of lower energy pr
ices starts disappearing 
gradually, and the eased monetary stance trickles 

through. Average in
flation is forecast at 0.3% this 
year before rising to 1.3% next year. 
Belgium™s economy is expected to continue growing at the cautious pace of 1.1% in 2015 and 1.5% in 
2016. Moderate price pressures are supportive of private consumption in the short term, though limited 

wage growth dampens prospects over the medium term even as domestic activity starts to reap the early 

benefits of competitiveness-enhancing measures. The fiscal deficit is expected to fall to 2.6% of GDP 

this year and to 2.4% in 2016. 
Member States, Belgium 
  67 Improving government balance The general government deficit stood at 3.2% of 
GDP in 2014. Revenue growth was impacted by a 

fall in dividend revenue of 0.2% of GDP, while 

one-off factors such as 
a tax regularisation had a 
positive impact of 0.3% of GDP. 
In 2015, the headline de
ficit is expected to 
improve to 2.6% of GDP. Revenues are boosted by 

a strong increase in co
rporate income taxation, 
thanks to the lower reference rate for notional 

interest deduction. On the other hand, the limited 

wage growth and measures to lower the tax burden 

on labour constrain the growth of personal income 

taxes and social contributions. 
Current expenditure is expected to grow only 
modestly, thanks to low inflation and sizeable 

consolidation measures taken at all levels of 

government. Furthermore, interest expenditure is 

projected to fall by 0.3% of GDP thanks to the 

decline in market interest rates. After an 

exceptional tax reimbursement in 2014, capital 

expenditure is expected to drop sharply in 2015. 
Overall, one-off measures and temporary factors 
are expected to have a positive impact of 0.4% of  
GDP on the government balance. This includes an 
additional impact of the 2013 tax regularisation, 

the anticipative taxation of pension savings and an 

extension of the temporary regime for the taxation 

of liquidation capital gains. The structural balance 

is forecast to improve by ½ %% of GDP in 2015. 

 
In 2016, under the usual no-policy-change assump-

tion, the headline deficit is expected to improve to 

2.4% of GDP. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is 

expected to decline due to the drop in one-off 

revenues and an announced reduction in social 

contributions. This is more than offset by a further 

drop in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio, thanks to 

better cyclical conditions, the additional impact of 

consolidation measures 
and the freeze of social 
benefits and public wages. Interest expenditure is 

also expected to decline 
further. As a result, the 
structural balance is proj
ected to improve by ¼% 
of GDP in 2016. 
The debt ratio reached 106.5% of GDP at the end 
of 2014. It is projected 
to stabilise over the forecast 
horizon, also thanks to downward stock-flow 

adjustments such as project
ed debt issuances above 
nominal value and the reimbursement of a loan by 

a financial institution.

  2. BULGARIA 
Weak investment limits growth 
 68 Growth outlook remains subdued In the fourth quarter of 2014, real GDP of Bulgaria 
expanded by 0.4%, in line with the growth 

recorded in the previous 
quarter. Quarterly private 
consumption increased by 1.1%, its fastest pace in 

six quarters, probably also thanks to the boost in 

confidence provided by the pay-out of the 

guaranteed deposits of the collapsed Corporate 

Commercial Bank. Net exports also contributed 

positively to quarterly growth. Overall, real GDP 

growth is projected to have grown by 1.7% in 

2014, supported by public investment and some 

recovery in private consumption after the latter 

dropped strongly in 2013. Economic growth is 

projected to moderate to 1.0% in 2015, before 

picking up slightly to 1.3% in 2016.  
Domestic demand is projected to slowdown After benefitting from low inflation and the fall in 

fuel prices towards th
e end of 2014, private 
consumption is expected to
 slow down in 2015 in 
line with weak wage and employment growth. 
Private investment as a share of GDP has been 
declining since 2008, reflecting an unsupportive 

business environment and decreased risk appetite, 

also limiting foreign capital inflows. This situation 

is not expected to chan
ge noticeably in 2015 or 
2016, as the uncertainty of the post-crisis period, 

prolonged by the domestic financial sector 

turbulence in 2014, is likely to continue to weigh 

on credit activity and investment decisions. 
While public investment growth was the main 
driver of gross fixed capital formation in 2013 and 

2014, mainly linked to increased use of available 

EU structural funds, its contribution to growth is 

projected to turn slightly negative in 2015, as the 

2007-13 programming period is coming to an end 

and the government looks to implement important 

consolidation measures. Public investment is 

expected to weaken further in 2016 as EU co-

financed projects under the new operational 

programmes take time to be implemented. 
Net exports expected to contribute positively Exports are expected to gr
ow faster than imports 
over 2015 and 2016, as international demand 

increases and leads to a positive contribution of net 

exports to economic growth. Exporting industries 

are also expected to benefit from the depreciation 

of the euro, to which the level is pegged, especially 

given that a sizeable por
tion of Bulgarian exports 
goes to non-euro area countries. Imports growth is 

expected to remain modest, in line with weakening 

domestic demand.

Bulgaria -Real GDP growth, output gap

Output gap (lhs)

Unemployment rate (rhs)
forecast% of GDP% of labour force
 Labour market recovery remains slow Employment stabilised in 2014, increasing by 
0.4% after falling by the same amount the year 

before. The growth was mainly the result of an 

increased number of jobs in agriculture and trade. 

Employment in manufacturing also stabilised, 

increasing by 0.2%. Employment is expected to 

remain broadly unchanged in 2015 and 2016, 

while the decrease in the labour force should 

further reduce unemployment to below 10
% in 2016 after having peaked at 13% in 2013. 
Inflation to remain negative well into 2015 Bulgaria recorded the st
rongest consumer price 
decline in the EU in 2014, with the HICP at -1.6%, 
Real GDP growth is expected to moderate from 1.7
% in 2014 to 1.0
% in 2015, before slightly picking 
up to 1.3
% in 2016. An expected slowdown in public investment and continued weak private investment 
is likely to weigh on the growth outlook. Inflation is projected to remain negative well into 2015, but to 

turn positive towards the end of the year. After reaching 2.8% of GDP in 2014, the general government 

deficit is set to remain at 2.9% of GDP in both 2015 and 2016. 
Member States, Bulgaria 
  69 due to a combination of domestic and external 
factors putting pressure on prices since mid-2013. 

The negative contribution coming from 

administratively-set prices faded away in 2014-Q4, 

largely due to the increase 
in electricity prices for 
households of around 10% in October. The 

contribution from import prices remained negative 

for a second consecutive year. Inflation is not 

expected to pick up until well into 2015, leaving 

the average rate for the y
ear at around -0.5%, as 
private consumption weakens and international 

energy prices are proj
ected to remain low. 
Nevertheless, consumer pric
es are expected to turn 
slightly positive in annual terms towards the end of 

2015, as the base effects of administrative 

decreases, including 
in healthcare and 
telecommunications, drop out. Inflation is 

projected to pick up to 1.0% in 2016, once the 

effect from the previous fall in oil prices fades. 
Risks appear to be balanced On the positive side, private investment could turn 

out higher than expected
 if confidence and the 
business climate improve faster than expected. On 

the negative side, private consumption could be 

weaker if the observed labour market recovery,  
driven by volatile sectors like agriculture and 
trade, proves short-lived. Both consumer and 

business sector confidence remains fragile and 

could deteriorate in case of further signs of 

instability in the financial sector. 
Budget deficit to remain elevated The general government deficit is projected to 

have increased from 0.9% of GDP in 2013 to 2.8% 

of GDP in 2014, as a result of some expenditure 

over-runs and weaker-than-expected revenues. 

There is a risk to the final headline deficit 

concerning the statistical recording of the financial 

sector support measures. The government deficit is 

estimated at 2.9% of GDP in 2015, mostly due to 

weaker indirect tax revenue, and to stay at 2.9% in 

2016, based on a no-policy-change assumption. 

Bulgaria™s structural defi
cit is projected at around 
2½% over 2014-16, reflecting the negative output 

gap. General government gross debt increased 

from 18.3% at end 2013 to 27.6% of GDP at end 

2014, reflecting the support to the financial sector 

as well as the increased budget deficit. By the end 

of 2016, government debt 
is expected to reach 
31.2% of GDP.

  3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
Domestic demand drives the rebound 
 70 Economic turnaround in 2014 There was a strong turnar
ound in th
e performance of the Czech economy in
 2014, with real GDP 
growing 2.0% after a contraction of 0.7% in the 

previous year. The rebound in investment was 

particularly strong, although falling inventories 

weighed slightly on growth. Although export 

growth was buoyant, import growth was even 

greater and net exports had a slightly negative 

impact on real GDP growth. Confidence indicators 

have remained robust in the opening months of 

2015, suggesting continued strength in domestic 

demand. Real GDP is expected to grow by 2.5% 

and 2.6% in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Graph II.3.1:
Czech Republic -Real GDP growth and 
contributions
 Investment contributing strongly to growth Recent data confirm the ma
jor role of investment 
growth in the rebound of the Czech economy. 

Investment rose by 4.5% in 2014, compared to a 

contraction of 4.4% in 2013. There was a 

particularly strong pick up in public investment, as 

the government made a renewed effort to co-

finance projects before the expiry of EU funds. 

Investment is expected to continue fuelling growth 

in 2015 (1.3 pps. contribution to real GDP 

growth), with public investment buoyed by a 

sizeable one-off increase in
 military expenditure 
and increased absorption of
 available EU funds. 
The contribution is forecast 
to be slightly weaker 
in 2016 (0.8 pps.), with government investment 

expected to fall sharpl
y due to the projected 
slowdown in the drawing of EU funds and the 

ensuing lower co-financing
 needs. Given the high 
import intensity of investment, this fall will 

contribute to an increased contribution of net 

exports to real GDP growth.  
Rising wages fuel consumption growth The renewed strength of
 the Czech economy has 
led to improved labour market conditions, with 

unemployment falling to 5.8% in the fourth quarter 

of 2014. Wage growth also started to strengthen, 

with compensation per employee rising by 3.0% in 

2014, significantly outpacing growth in consumer 

prices. These conditions have boosted private 

consumption, which rose by 1.7% in 2014. A 

projected further decline in the unemployment rate 

is expected to contribute 
to tighter labour market 
conditions over the forecas
t horizon. Growth in 
compensation per employee is expected to remain 

strong, at around 3.0% per year, allowing for an 

acceleration of private co
nsumption to 2.1% and 
2.3% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. 
Inflation to remain low in 2015 HICP inflation averaged 0.4% in 2014, less than 

the 2013 rate despite the 
intervention by the Czech 
National Bank in November 2013 to further ease 

the monetary policy stance 
via a weakening of the 
CZK exchange rate. The HICP inflation rate fell 

considerably at the end of 2014, mainly due to 

falling oil prices, and was negative during the first 

two months of 2015. The substantial decline in oil 

and other commodity prices since mid-2014 is 

forecast to continue to weigh on inflation in 2015. 

At the same time, tighter 
labour market conditions, 
the quantitative easing programme of the ECB, and 

the recent depreciation of the CZK vis-à-vis the 

USD are expected to partly
 offset this downward 
trend and exert some upward pressure. 

Administered prices are forecast to have an overall 

neutral effect over the 
forecast horizon, after 
The Czech Republic returned to growth in 2014. This was largely driven by domestic demand, with net 
exports detracting slightly. Domestic demand is expected to remain the main driver of growth in 2015 

and 2016, with net exports projected to contribute negatively in 2015 but positively in 2016 as the 

external environment improves. The headline general government deficit is set to remain unchanged in 

2015 and to decrease in 2016 due to a favourable macroeconomic environment. 
Member States, The Czech Republic 
  71 having contributed positively last year. The annual 
HICP inflation rate is expected to ease to 0.2% in 

2015 before rising again to 1.4% in 2016. 
Structural budget balance to deteriorate in 
2015 The general government deficit reached 2.0% of 
GDP in 2014. This wors
e-than-expected outcome 
was due to several factors. On the revenue side, 

income from excise duties 
on tobacco declined by 
almost 50% compared to 2013. This was mainly 

due to the introduction of a time limit on pre-

stocking of tobacco prod
ucts. On the expenditure 
side, a one-off payment was made from the 

Deposit Insurance Fund and public investment 

growth accelerated significa
ntly towards the end of 
the year. The structural 
deficit reached 1.0% of 
GDP in 2014.  
The headline deficit is expected to remain 
unchanged at 2.0% of GDP in 2015, but the 

structural deficit is proj
ected to deteriorate by 
some ½ pp. to about 1½ % of GDP, reflecting a 

loosening of fiscal policy. Revenues are projected 

to be negatively affected by the reintroduction of 

tax credits for working pensioners and families 

with two or more children, as well as the 

introduction of a third (lower) VAT rate on books, 
medicines and child nutritional products. Revenues 
from excise duties on tobacco are projected to 

increase significantly, however, returning to their 

long-term trend. A higher public sector wage bill is 

expected to contribute to stronger government 

consumption, while higher indexation of pensions 

is expected to increase social outlays. Government 

investment is expected to increase by more than 

20%, largely due to th
e higher absorption of 
available EU funds but al
so due to higher capital 
spending from domestic sources and exceptional 

military expenditure related to the lease of fighter 

jets.  
The improvement in the projected general 
government deficit to 1.5% of GDP in 2016 is 

mainly due to a more favourable macroeconomic 

environment but also to a fall in public investment. 

Public investment related to EU funds is projected 

to decrease significantly from the 2015 peak due to 

an expected slowdown in the implementation of 

projects at the beginning of the new programming 

period. The forecast does not incorporate the 

impact of the not-yet-adop
ted measures that aim at 
improving tax collection. The fiscal position is 

expected to be broadly neutral. The debt-to-GDP 

ratio is forecast to fall to 41.6% in 2016 due to 

increased use of available cash buffers and better 

liquidity management.

was driven by domestic demand, while net exports 

was a drag on overall GDP growth for the third 

year in a row, due to a higher increase in imports 

than in exports.  
GDP growth is forecast to
 increase to 1.8% in 
2015 and 2.1% in 2016 as the recovery is expected 

to strengthen over the forecasting period on the 

back of very low interest rates and the drop in the 

effective exchange rate in the first months of the 

year. Compared to the 2015 winter forecast, the 

projected growth rate has thus been revised 

slightly upwards in 2015, while it remains 

unchanged for 2016. 
Private consumption is expected to gradually play 
a larger role as households' disposable income is 

supported by growing real wages, low interest 

rates and benign developments in the labour 

market. Private consumption is also supported by 

an improvement in households' asset position as 

the housing market has b
een recovering since  
mid-2012, albeit with large geographical 

differences. Consumer confidence has stayed at a 

high level since the 
summer of 2013, and 
according to the European Commission's Business 

and Consumer Survey, it reached the highest level 

in the 30-year history of the series in March 2015.  
The savings surplus in th
e private sector remains 
high, especially in the 
corporate sector. Since 2009, the net investment ratio has been negative in 

the private non-agricultural industries, reflecting 

idle capacity and low demand. Over the forecast 

years, business investment is expected to pick-up 

as the overall recovery becomes more firmly 
established and capacity utilisation increases. 
Exports are projected to pick up gradually over the 

next two years, supported by increased growth in 

Danish export markets, improved competitiveness 

- as measured by relative unit labour costs - and a 

marked decline in the ef
fective exchange rate.

pps. Labour market continues to perform well The unemployment rate, which stood at 6.2% of 
the labour force in February 2015, has been on a 

declining trend since spring 2012. The 

strengthening of the economic recovery over the 

forecast horizon is expected to further lower the 

unemployment rate to 5.8% in 2016. Employment 

grew by 0.7% in 2014, driven by an improvement 

in private employment, and is set to increase 

further by 0.8% in 2015 and 0.9% in 2016. 
The harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) 
grew by 0.3% on an annual basis in March 2015 

and is forecast to rise gradually as the effect from 

the decline in commodity prices tapers off and the 

economic recovery strengthens; the depreciation of 

the krone also plays a role. HICP inflation is 

expected to hit 0.6% in 2015 before rising to 1.7% 

in 2016. 
Denmark's economic recovery gathered
 steam in the second half of 2014 and is expected to strengthen 
further. The economic activity is currently supported by a number of expansionary factors, such as 

historically low interest rates an
d the decline of the effective exchang
e rate. Together with a seven-year 
trend of improving competitiveness, Denmark is poise
d to continue recovering. The fiscal balance is 
expected to return to negative territory this year, but the deficit is forecast to remain below the 3% 

reference value. 
Member States, Denmark 
  73 Risks appear balanced Macroeconomic risks to the forecast appear 
broadly balanced related on the one hand to 

external factors such as geopolitical tensions, 

mainly associated with developments in Ukraine, 

and on the other to a possible release of pent-up 

private consumption and investments as private 

savings have remained high despite the very low 

interest rates. 
Deterioration of the fiscal balance is driven by 
temporary factors The general government balance posted a surplus 
of 1.2% of GDP in 2014, to a large degree boosted 

by large one-off revenues from a capital pension 

taxation measure and high extraordinary revenues 

from the pension yield tax. 
The surplus is expected to turn into a deficit of 
1.5% in 2015. The deterioration is mainly due to 

lower one-off revenues from the pension taxation 

measure (decreasing by an 
estimated 2.4 pps.) and 
lower revenues from the pension yield  
tax. The drop in oil prices since last summer is also 
expected to yield a negative impact on public 

revenues. In 2016, the fiscal deficit is set to widen 

to 2.6% of GDP, as the one-off revenues come to a 

halt and revenues from the pension yield tax 

decrease. 
The structural balance is 
expected to deteriorate 
from a surplus of about ½% of GDP in 2014 to a 

deficit of around ½% and 1½% of GDP in 2015 

and 2016 respectively. The 
structural balance in 
Denmark is to a large degree influenced by large 

and volatile revenue items, such as revenues from 

oil and gas production and from the pension yield 

tax. The deterioration over the forecast horizon is 

mainly due to an expected drop in revenues from 

these items.  
The general government gross debt level is 
expected to decrease from 45.2% of GDP in 2014 

to 39.5% in 2015 and 39.2% in 2016. The 

significant reduction in debt in 2015 reflects the 

temporary suspension of issuance of government 

bonds that was put in place in January 2015 to 

dampen the appreciation pressure on the krone.

  5. GERMANY 
Temporary boost in activity fo
llowed by steady expansion 
 74 Acceleration of growth amplified by oil prices Real GDP climbed dynamically by 0.7% (q-o-q, 
seasonally and working-day adjusted) in the fourth 

quarter of 2014, after rising just 0.1% in the 

previous quarter. On average, real GDP expanded 

by 1.6% in 2014. Annual growth was mostly 

driven by private consumption and gross fixed 

capital formation. Net external trade contributed 

moderately to growth. The annual growth rates of 

GDP components, however, mask an uneven 

development in the course of the year. Notably, the 

recovery in private investment, which started in 

2013, was interrupted in the second quarter of 

2014 and private consumption was boosted by 

declining oil prices in the second half of the year. 
Following dynamic economic growth in the fourth 
quarter of 2014, indicator
s suggest a deceleration 
of growth as the significant boost from the decline 

in oil prices fades. For the first quarter of 2015, 

still a considerable expansion is expected thanks to 

service and industrial production sectors. 

Declining industry orders 
in recent months, which 
are partly explained by the volatility of large 

contracts, point towards a weakened expansion of 

manufacturing output. However, the brightening of 

firms™ business expectations above their long-term 

average since the end of 2014 indicates solid 

growth in the upcoming months. Driven by the 

robust labour market, the improving external 

environment including su
pport from the weaker 
euro exchange rate, and favourable financing 

conditions, GDP growth is
 forecast to remain 
above potential growth. Helped by more working 

days and a stronger carry-over effect to the current 

year from activity in the fi
nal quarter of last year 
than thought in the winter, 
real GDP is expected to 
increase by 1.9% in 2015 and 2.0% in 2016. 
Consumption growth bolstered by low inflation 
and the robust labour market  Employment growth benefits from buoyant 
economic activity which mitigates the effect of the 

new general minimum wage on job creation. 
Private consumption is forecast to grow strongly 
thanks to continued real wage growth, low 

unemployment, high net immigration, and low 

interest rates. The strong decline in energy prices 

has also widened the financial scope of 

households, much of which they are likely to use 

for spending, boosting consumption.

pps.  Hesitant recovery of business investment Private equipment investment declined in the 
fourth quarter of 2014. The continued weakness is 

at odds with an environment of strong private 

consumption, improving external demand and 

favourable financing conditions. However, as 

domestic and external demand pick up and 

uncertainty eventually fades, the wait-and-see 

attitude among firms should give way to a 

recovery in corporate investment starting in the 

first half of this year. Pent-up replacement 

investment and expansions of firms™ product lines 

provide incentives to invest in the near term, while 

raising production capacities may play an 

increasing role as capacity utilisation approaches 

normal levels. Housing 
investment has recently 
shown some renewed strength but is expected to 

moderate its rapid pace of expansion. Public sector 

investment is projected to gain some momentum, 

while remaining at a comparatively low level. 
Germany™s economic growth is expected to benefit from the robust labour market and the favourable 
financing conditions underpinning domestic demand
. The recent decline in oil prices and the 
depreciation of the euro are projected to provide further impetus. Corporate investment is forecast to 

resume hesitantly, while public investment is expected
 to pick up. The general 
government budget is set 
to remain in surplus over
 the forecast horizon. 
Member States, Germany 
  75 Rising trade surplus driven by goods prices Firms™ export expectations have noticeably 
recovered. Export growth is expected to rise along 

with improving demand growth in trading partners, 

also supported by the lo
wer euro exchange rate. 
Import growth may be supported by consumption 

and the pick-up of investment. This is forecast to 

offset robust export growth, but the current 

account surplus is nonetheless set to rise further in 

2015 due to improvements to the terms of trade. 
Very low inflation determined by oil prices The strong dampening effect of lower oil prices on 

energy prices should vanish by 2016 but may have 

some indirect effects on other consumer prices. 

Rising labour costs are expected to be supportive 

to core inflation. HICP inflation is projected at 

0.3% in 2015 before rebounding to 1.8% in 2016. 
Sizeable structural budget surplus The general government budg
et recorded a surplus 
of 0.7% of GDP in 2014. The sound labour market 

and dynamic private consumption should result in 

buoyant tax revenue growth over the forecast 

horizon, despite an increase in the minimum 

income tax allowance and child allowances. In 
2015, a rise in the long-t
erm care contribution rate 
is offset by lower pension and health insurance 

contribution rates. Higher expenditure growth is 

projected, due in part to a small rise in 

infrastructure investment, higher spending on 

pensions, extended long-term care services and 

more funds for development aid.  
Overall, the headline balance is expected to show a 
surplus also in 2015 and 2016, and the structural 

surplus should remain si
zeable over the forecast 
horizon. As a result, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio is 

set to decrease rapidly. The on-going winding up 

of ‚bad banks™ could further reduce the debt stock.

Growth despite external constraints 
 76 Strong growth in 2014 despite external 
constraints Estonia™s real GDP growth
 reached 2.1% in 2014 
despite growth weaknesses in its main trading 

partners, particularly Finland and Russia. 

Domestic trade and manufac
turing contributed the 
most to growth, while the value added in transport 

and construction decreased. Consumption growth 

rose to 4.6%, led by strong wage increases, higher 

pensions, and low consumer price inflation. 

Investment activity fell sharply in the second half 

of 2014 in the energy and public sectors, resulting 

in a decline of 2.8% in gross fixed capital 

formation in 2014. Exports rose by 2.6% despite 

weak external demand an
d Russian retaliatory 
measures against EU™s trade sanctions. 
Buoyant private consumption continues Real GDP is forecast to 
accelerate marginally in 
2015 and then more substantially in 2016, to 

around 3%, as the global outlook improves. Private 

consumption is expected to remain vigorous over 

the forecast horizon as real
 income continues to be 
supported by low inflation and rising wages. 

Income tax cuts and higher family benefits in 2015 

are projected to partly feed into a temporary hike 

in household savings. 
Financing conditions remain favourable Bank lending is projected to increase only 

moderately due to low, but rising demand for 

credit. Macro-prudential regulations that entered 

into force in March 2015 are not expected to 

tighten lending practices, as they are broadly in 

line with banks™ internal credit regulations. 

Investment is forecast to increase only marginally 

in 2015 due to negative confidence effects from 

heightened geopolitical tensions and lingering 

excess capacity. In 2016, 
growing external demand 
is expected to increase 
corporate investment in 
equipment. Public investment is projected to 

gradually start growing again over the course of 

2015 after disbursements under the new EU 

development fund programmes begin. Housing 
investment is forecast to
 regain momentum this 
year and next thanks to generally favourable 

financing terms and rising incomes.

 Current account remains close to balance So far, rising unit labour costs do not seem to be 
affecting Estonia™s compe
titiveness. In 2014, net 
exports of services register
ed a remarkable surplus, 
notably in transport. As regards merchandise trade, 

exports of electrical equipment expanded further, 

especially to Sweden, acc
ounting for a fifth of 
Estonia™s total exports. After a fall of 15% in 2014, 

exports of goods to Russia 
are expected to further 
drop by more than 50% in 2015, reflecting lower 

demand and the sharp depreciation of the Russian 

rouble. However, the exp
ected recovery in euro-
area demand from mid-2015 is set to support 

exports and ensure a positive external balance of 

goods and services throughout the forecast period. 
Downside risks to the forecast could stem from a 
further escalation of the tensions in Ukraine, which 

would further affect bo
th trade flows with 
neighbouring Russia and inflows of foreign direct 

investment. 
Unemployment swiftly declines Labour supply constraints are building up, as 

emigration and low birth rates reduce Estonia™s 

working age population, particularly in its  
Estonia™s economic growth is forecast to remain slightly above 2% in 2015, before rising to 2.9% in 
2016 as external demand recovers. Unemployment is set to fall further in a tightening labour market. 

With nominal government budget close to balance, public debt is expected to fall below 10% of GDP by 

2016. 
Member States, Estonia 
  77 19-35 age category. This tr
end is expected to cut 
the unemployment rate to around 6% in 2016, 

down from 8.6% in 2013, and to keep nominal 

wage growth above 5% over the forecast period. 

Labour force participation remains high, at close to 

70%, and is set to remain broadly stable in 2015 

and 2016. 
Inflation set to rebound Annual inflation turned negative in mid-2014 

largely because of steep declines in international 

commodity prices, in particular crude oil. At the 

same time, warm weather and easier access to 

cheaper regional energy networks resulted in lower 

electricity prices. However,
 the euro™s depreciation 
against the US dollar in ear
ly 2015 is expected to 
keep annual average infla
tion at around 0.2% in 
2015, a level very close to the one expected for the 

euro area as a whole. In 2016, further excise tax 

and administrative price 
increases, as well as 
continued strong wage growth, are expected to 

push inflation up to around 2%. 
Budget close to balance in nominal terms The general government budget reached a surplus 

of 0.6% of GDP in 2014, substantially above  
expectations. The over-performance was due to 
higher tax revenue, lower-than-planned social 

transfers and postponing of public investment. 
In 2015, the fiscal position is expected to worsen 
to a deficit of 0.2% of GDP. This is caused by a 

substantial increase of family benefits in January 

2015 and the regular pension indexation by 6.3% 

in April. Moreover, across-the-board tax relief 

measures for labour and cap
ital entered into force 
in January 2015. These measures are expected to 

be partially compensated by higher dividends from 

state-owned enterprises and further increases in 

indirect taxes. 
Under a no-policy-change 
assumption, the budget 
is expected to remain clos
e to balance in 2016, in 
nominal terms. 
In structural terms, the fiscal position is assessed to 
be in a small surplus in 2014, before deteriorating 

by about ½ pps. of GDP in 2015. In 2016, under a 

no-policy-change assumption, the structural deficit 

is projected to worsen by about 
 pps. of GDP due 
to the widening of a positive output gap and a 

smaller impact from one-off measures. Estonia™s 

public debt is expected to fall below 10% of GDP 

in 2016.

  7. IRELAND 
A revival of domestic demand supports solid growth 
 78 The Irish economy surged in 2014, after near zero 
growth a year earlier. Real GDP grew by 4.8%, 

setting the ground for resilient growth over the 

forecast horizon, albeit at more moderate but still 

solid rates, of around 3½% in 2015 and 2016. 
Exports and investment have been driving GDP 
but consumption is taking on a bigger role Exceptionally strong net exports explain most of 
Ireland™s GDP growth in 
2014. Ireland benefitted 
from its improved competitiveness, its large base 

of multinationals, and its links with the dynamic 

UK and US economies. Exports grew by 12.6% in 

the year. However, some of these exports are 

explained by the production of goods abroad on 

behalf of Irish-domiciled multinationals. This  

so-called contracted production has less impact on 

tax revenue and jobs in Ireland. Imports, which 

include intermediate goods and services used as 

inputs in contracted produ
ction, accelerated with a 
lag, towards the end of 2014, when quarterly GDP 

growth slowed down markedly.  
Over the forecast horizon, the weaker euro is 
expected to benefit indigenous firms the most, as 

multinationals are more exposed to increases in the 

cost of foreign inputs fo
r which they are price 
takers. In addition, imports are set to accelerate in 

2015 and 2016, as domestic demand recovers.  
Investment grew by 11.3% in 2014 and is expected 
to continue to be one of the main drivers of GDP 

growth in 2015 and 2016, while remaining 

volatile. Ireland continues to attract investment 

from multinationals, and construction is expected 

to continue to recover from very low levels. 
Consumption accelerated at the end of 2014 and is 
projected to strengthen further in 2015 and 2016, 

when domestic demand components are expected 

to take over from net exports as the main growth 

drivers. The recovery in employment and wages, 

tax reliefs in Budget 2015 and consumer 

confidence will support private consumption. Yet, 

indebtedness continues to weigh on households' 

propensity to consume. 
Bank net lending to households and non-financial 
companies continues to decline as demand remains 

subdued and Irish companies use retained earnings 

for investment. Nonetheless, the profitability of the 

domestic banks continues to improve, which 

should boost their capacity to extend credit.  
Job creation will progress further, while inflation 
transitions to moderate levels Ireland™s unemployment rate is forecast to reach 
9.2% in 2016, down from 11.3% in 2014. Labour 

market participation is expected to gradually pick 

up and moderate the pace at which unemployment 

is falling, while the weaker euro is forecast to 

boost labour-intensive indigenous production. 
Inflation will remain very subdued in 2015, given 
that energy prices are still low. In 2016, inflation is 

forecast to rise in line with
 expectations in the euro 
area. Property prices rebounded in 2014 by 16.3%. 

Yet, the number of transactions is low and prices 

remain 38% below their 2007 peak. Macro-

prudential limits to mort
gage lending, recently 
introduced by the Central Bank of Ireland, help 

dampen price pressures. However, housing supply 

remains a concern, particularly in Dublin.

Ireland -Real GDP growth and contributions
 The risks for this forecast are balanced. A stronger 
recovery in the euro area could push net exports 

further. At the same ti
me, accelerating household 
The Irish economy re-emerged in 2014 as one of Europe™s top performers. Economic activity is forecast 
to remain resilient in 2015 and 2016, as domestic demand takes over net exports as main growth driver. 

Yet, due to the still high level of private debt the st
rength of private consumption remains uncertain. The 
government's deficit and debt are forecast to improve on the back of sustained economic activity.  
Member States, Ireland 
  79 deleveraging could dampen private consumption. 
Wage increases, if not in line with productivity, 

would erode competitiveness. 
Public finances improve thanks to buoyant tax 
revenues and interest expenditure savings. In 2014, the general gove
rnment deficit reached 
4.1% of GDP, down from 5.8% of GDP in 2013. 

As revenues grew in line with buoyant GDP, the 

improvement mostly reflects a reduction of 

primary current expenditure in percent of GDP. 

Still, in nominal terms, total government 

expenditure increased for th
e first time since 2010, 
despite markedly lower interest expenditure. The 

increase reflects higher capital expenditure, 

including public infrastructure.  
In 2015, the general government deficit is forecast 
at 2.8% of GDP, 0.1% of GDP lower than in the 

Commission 2015 winter forecast. The moderate 

downward revision in the face of strong economic  
activity reflects a combination of deficit increasing 
and decreasing factors. These are notably, on the 

one hand, a cash dividend from Allied Irish Banks, 

lower debt servicing costs and better than expected 

cash returns in the first months of 2015. On the 

other hand, infrastructure investment and 

expenditure in healthcare are expected to rise. 
Under the usual no-policy-change assumption, the 
deficit is expected to reach 2.9% of GDP in 2016. 

The main risks around the 
deficit projections are 
persisting spending pressures linked to 

demographics and possible increases in public 

sector pay.  
The structural deficit is expected to improve over 
the forecast horizon, reach
ing about 3¼ % in 2016 
from around 4% of GDP in 2014. Public debt is 

projected to continue falling and reach 103.8% of 

GDP in 2016, down from 123.2% in 2013. This 

marked improvement 
largely reflects the 
liquidation of the Irish Banking Resolution 

Corporation.

  8. GREECE 
The recovery fails to accelerate 
amid high political uncertainty 
 80 Uncertainty and illiquidity hinder growth 
prospects The forecast figures for Greece are subject to a 
high degree of uncertainty and take into account 

developments up until the cut-off date of 21 April.  
In 2014, private consumption and net exports 
drove economic activity, prompting a long-awaited 

return to growth, which measured 0.8% in terms of 

real GDP. Backed by 
falling prices and the 
adjustment of the la
bour market, private 
consumption increased for the first time after five 

years of continuous contraction. Exports of 

services improved strongly thanks to the tourism 

and shipping sectors, goods exports also improved, 

although stronger domestic demand meant that 

imports also rose. Investme
nt increased for the first 
time since 2008, mainly due to the increase in 

equipment investment. 
The positive momentum has, however, been hurt 
by uncertainty since th
e announcement of snap 
elections in December. The current lack of clarity 

on the policy stance of the government vis-à-vis 

the country™s policy commitments in the context of 

the EU/IMF support ar
rangements worsens 
uncertainty further. Greece™s economic sentiment 

indicator (ESI) deteriorated in March due to falling 

confidence in all busin
ess sectors, although 
consumer confidence remain
ed at relatively high 
levels. Greece™s purchasing managers index (PMI), 

recorded a further deterioration in business 

conditions for manufacturing in March, suggesting 

that the sector is still in depression, with new 

export orders and output falling. 
Conditional on agreement with the EU/IMF by 
June and assuming that business confidence 

returns along with the liquidity of the government 

and banking sector, the economy is now forecast to 

grow by around ½% in 2015, considerably lower 

than in the previous for
ecast. Private consumption 
should benefit slightly from the drop in oil prices 

and the return of ‚under-the-mattress™ deposits to 

the economy. Export growth is expected to 

continue in 2015 as tourism and shipping should 

benefit from the weaker
 euro. Uncertainty, 
however, is taking a heavy toll on investment, 
which is also suffering from limited credit supply 

from the financial sector and a build-up of arrears 

from the public sector. In 2016, real GDP growth 

is projected to strengthen to 2.9%, as investment 

rebounds on the back of structural reforms. 
Greece™s current account balance is expected to 
improve further in the fo
recast horizon supported 
by past and ongoing structural and institutional 

reforms, as well as by th
e weaker euro. The current 
account deficit is forecast 
to shrink to 1.6% of 
GDP in 2015 and to 1.3% in 2016. 
The unemployment rate fell to 26.5% in 2014 
reflecting the creation of about 100
000 new jobs. 
In 2015, the unemployment rate is projected to fall 

moderately to 25.6%, as the recovery remains 

muted. When growth picks up in 2016, the 

unemployment rate should fall further to 23.2%. 
Prices fell by 1.4% in 2014 and inflation is 
expected to remain below zero this year, due to 

weak domestic demand, before turning positive in 

2016 as the recovery gains pace.

 Public finances affected by weaker growth, 
lower tax compliance and policy changes The rise in uncertainty since the autumn of 2014 
and the slowdown in the recovery have had a 

significant impact on Greece™s public finances, 
In 2014, the real GDP of Greece grew for the first
 time since 2007, expandin
g by 0.8%. The conditions 
to support growth are in place but uncertainty and tighter financing conditions are holding back the 

recovery and weighing on public finances. 
Member States, Greece 
  81 resulting in a significant shortfall in state revenues 
at the end of 2014 and in the first two months of 

2015. The poor revenue co
llection around the turn 
of the year resulted in a significantly weaker-than-

expected fiscal outcome for 2014. The general 

government balance at -3.5% of GDP in 2014, is 

substantially worse than expected in the winter 

forecast. The headline 
balance in 2014 is, 
nevertheless, much better than in previous years, 

as it is no longer affected by the large one-off 

effects of bank recapitalis
ations recorded in 2012 
and especially 2013. 
Given the existing uncertainty about the timely 
implementation of necessary reforms and budget 

commitments, projections for 2015 and 2016 are 

based on a no-policy-change assumption. 
Accordingly, the forecasts
 for the headline balance 
in 2015 and 2016 have been lowered to -2.1% of 

GDP and -2.2% respectively. This reflects weaker-

than-expected revenues due to lower growth 

prospects offsetting a rebound in collection after 

the first quarter of th
e year. The projection 
assumes that profits from Eurosystem securities 

transactions (the SMP and ANFA programmes) are 

transferred, which in turn presumes that new fiscal  
measures will be taken. Expenditure ceilings were 
binding in 2014 and are expected to remain so in 

the future as well. 
The government™s debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
peak in 2015 before declining in 2016. Favourable 

interest rates, better cash management together 

with the back-loaded payment schedule for loans 

from the European Financial Stability Facility 

(EFSF) will help to keep interest expenditure low 

for a long period, despite the high stock of debt.

  9. SPAIN 
Growth rising on the back of robust employment growth 
 82 Domestic demand still driving growth After a long recession, growth in Spain resumed in 
2014. Growth is set to gather further momentum, 

backed by improved labour market prospects, 

loosening financial conditions and renewed 

confidence, but also helped by favourable external 

developments and a less restrictive fiscal stance. 

These factors are expected 
to sustain growth over 
the forecast horizon, desp
ite the continued drag 
from high levels of private and public indebtedness 

and deleveraging. The adjustment of Spain™s 

external imbalances is al
so expected to accelerate 
compared to 2014.  
After having expanded by 0.6% and 0.7% q-o-q in 
the third and fourth quarters of 2014, economic 

activity is expected to have accelerated further in 

the first quarter of 2015. Although growth is 

expected to moderate in the second half of this 

year, GDP is now projected to expand by 2.8% in 

2015 and 2.6% in 2016, mainly driven by domestic 

demand. The drag from the external sector 

observed in 2014 is expected to narrow in 2015 

and turn broadly neutral in 2016. 
According to hard data on economic activity and 
soft data from confidence indicators, private 

consumption has remained quite resilient in the 

first quarter of 2015, with consumer confidence 

reaching historical highs. Such resilience is 

expected to persist as a result of faster-than-

foreseen employment growth and rising real gross 

disposable income, which are expected to also 

benefit from falling price levels throughout most 

of 2015 and low inflation thereafter. The 

household saving rate, currently at low levels, is 

set to increase moderately in the short term. 

Household leverage is set to keep falling as 

nominal GDP and real disposable incomes expand. 
Positive demand prospects, easing financing 
conditions and the projected rebound in exports are 

expected to underpin investment in equipment, 

despite the ongoing balance-sheet correction of 

non-financial corporations. After seven years of 

adjustment, a modest pick-up in construction, 
including residential investment, is expected to 
gather some strength in 2015 and 2016. Public 

investment is set to contribute only modestly to the

forecast
 Exports are expected to accelerate in 2015 and 
2016, backed by continued improvements in price 

and non-price competitiveness and the projected 

recovery in Spain™s main
 export markets. At the 
same time, after a sharp expansion in 2014 partly 

due to temporary factors, imports are forecast to 

moderate and align with long-term final demand 

elasticities. The current-
account surplus is set to 
widen to 1.2% of GDP in 2015 and then decline to 

1.0% in 2016 as the impact from the decline in oil 

prices and the depreciation of the euro gradually 

fade. In turn, net external lending is expected to 

rise to 1.6% and 1.4% of GDP in 2015 and 2016. 
Inflation is expected to remain negative in the 
short term at -0.6% in 2015 dragged down by 

falling oil prices, although this effect has been 

partly mitigated by the depreciation of the euro. In 

2016, however, inflation is forecast to turn 

positive, but remain low, as the economy™s output 

gap remains very large. 
Sustained employment growth Job creation gathered steam 
in the second half of 
2014, while the size of th
e labour force continued 
Robust job creation, easier financing conditions, enhanced confidence and low oil prices are set to keep 
fuelling domestic demand and economic growth in Spain. The drag of negative net exports on growth is 

expected to diminish over the forecast horizon 
as Spain™s competitiveness improves. The government 
deficit is expected to continue to narrow. 
Member States, Spain 
  83 to contract, resulting in the unemployment rate 
declining to 23.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

These positive trends are expected to intensify 

over the forecast horizon, helped by continued 

wage moderation and only modest increases in 

nominal unit labour costs. The labour force has 

started to grow again and unemployment is 

forecast to fall to 20.5% 
at the end of 2016.  
Upward risks related to stronger private 
consumption and investment, especially in 

equipment, would prevail in the short term over 

increased volatility in financial markets and 

deceleration in some emerging economies. 
Deficit reduction helped by recovery Thanks to the strong economic recovery and the 

enhanced financing conditions, public finances 

continued to improve in 2014. According to 

Eurostat data, the general government deficit 

narrowed to 5.7% of GDP last year, down from 

6.3% of GDP in 2013 (net of bank recapitalisations 

in both years). The improvement stemmed from 

both the revenue and the expenditure side, indirect 

tax revenues being boosted by stronger domestic 

demand and falling unemployment reining in 

social transfers. 
Going forward, the reduction of the deficit is 
relying mostly on the improving macroeconomic 

outlook. The government deficit is expected to fall 

to around 4.5% in 2015 and to fall by a further 

percentage point in 2016, despite the impact of 

recently-implemented tax cuts. The reduction in 

the deficit is held back by subdued nominal GDP 

growth, which is acting as a drag on revenue 

developments. Risks stem from uncertainty 

regarding the actual impact of the tax reform on 

revenues, contingent liabilities in the motorway 

sector and implementation risks in an election 

year. While pension expenditures are forecast to 
continue rising, falling unemployment should limit 

the growth of social transfers in the near future. 

Thanks to lower interest rates, interest expenditure 

should moderate over the forecast horizon. 
Spain™s structural deficit is expected to widen by 
about ½ pp. over the forecast period, reaching 

2½% of GDP in 2016. With low nominal GDP 

growth and a still-sizable budget deficit, the public 

debt ratio is expected to rise above 100% in 2015 

and to reach 101.4% in 2016.

Tailwinds pushing up domestic demand 
 84 Emerging from stagnation After three years of economic standstill, improved 
household confidence is pointing again towards 

expansion, which, in turn, will bolster business 

confidence. GDP growth is 
thus set to gain traction 
and reach 1.1% and 1.7% in 2015 and 2016 

respectively, mainly driven by private 

consumption on the back of lower energy prices, 

while the acceleration in investment would remain 

slow and the improvement in net exports stemming 

from the euro's depreciation is likely to be limited.

Graph II.10.1:
France -Real GDP growth and contributions
 Domestic demand remains the key driver In line with improving household confidence, 
private consumption is ex
pected to accelerate, 
supported by sustained wage growth, a reduced 

energy bill and low inflation. In addition, 

households are expected to consume over the 

forecast horizon the savings accumulated in 2014 
(as a result of the unanticipated increase in real 

disposable income), leading to a decline in their 

saving ratio. 
Falling oil prices and the on-going policy measures 
to reduce labour costs, namely the 
Tax Credit for 
Competitiveness and Employment
 (CICE) and the 
Responsibility and Solidarity Pact
 (RSP) are 
expected to gradually strengthen firms' profit 

margins and their capacity to invest, while credit 

conditions, already favourable, are assumed to be 
further eased by the ECB's accommodative 
monetary policy. However, as business confidence 

remains weak and capacity utilisation is still low, 

the acceleration in aggregate demand is projected 

to drive up equipment investment with a lag. 

Meanwhile, construction investment is projected to 

contract further in 2015 before picking up 

somewhat in 2016. All in all, total investment is 

projected to recover from 2016 onwards, further 

boosted by the Investment Plan for Europe and the 

government's investment plan.  
Limited support from net exports  The assumed acceleration in world demand is 

projected to give some impulse to exports from 

2015 onwards, while the depreciation of the euro is 

expected to provide some stimulus to export 

competitiveness. However, with the gradual 

acceleration in domestic
 demand, imports are 
expected to expand, bringing the growth 

contribution of net exports to zero in 2016.  
Labour market improves, inflation bottoms out  The positive impact of economic growth on 

employment, accentuated by the labour cost 

reductions associated with the CICE and the RSP, 

is expected to materialise gradually, as employers 

are likely to give first priority to increasing 

productivity over job creation. Thus, 

unemployment is expected to only slightly 

decrease from 2016. 
The incidence of the recent 
slump in oil prices on 
inflation is alleviated by the imported inflationary 

pressure stemming from the euro's depreciation. 

Headline inflation is thus expected to avoid 

negative territory and fall to zero in 2015, before 

increasing again in 2016, on the back of a 

narrowing output gap.  
Balanced risks to the growth outlook A lower pace of structural reforms could 

jeopardise the nascent improvement in household 

and business confidence and weaken the fragile 
France™s economic growth is expected to gain momentum over 2015 and 2016, mainly due to private 
consumption. Inflation is projected to reach zero in 2015 due to the fall in oil prices. The positive impact 

of the euro's depreciation on net exports will li
kely remain limited. The government™s headline deficit 
reached 4.0% of GDP in 2014 and is expected to 
continue receding in 2015 as growth picks up. 
Member States, France 
  85 recovery. On the upside, an earlier-than-expected 
improvement in business confidence would boost 

the economy further.  
General government deficit continues its 
gradual reduction  Despite the negative impact of low inflation on 
government finances, the general government 

deficit declined to 4.0% of GDP in 2014, 0.1 pps. 

below the 2013 level. Current public revenues 

grew by 2.0% in 2014, compared to 3.3% in 2013. 

Meanwhile, public expenditure growth was 

contained to 1.6%, the lowest rate recorded since 

1998, after 1.8% in 2013. The slowdown in public 

expenditure was achieved in spite of increasing 

costs linked to the ramp-up of the CICE. In 

particular, investment by local governments 

plummeted due to the combined effect of the 

electoral cycle and the reduction in the transfers 

from the central government. The Œ temporary 
 reduction in France's contribution to the EU budget 

also contributed to the low expenditure growth.  
In 2015, the improving macroeconomic outlook is 
set to result in a decrease in the general 

government deficit to 3.8% of GDP. Nominal GDP 

is set to pick up in 2015, with a positive impact on 

tax bases. Due to a lower amount of discretionary 

measures than in 2014 and to still low tax 
elasticities, current revenues as a share of GDP 
would decrease somewhat. 
Taking into account the 
expenditure cuts planned for 2015, including the 

additional measures announced in the stability 

programme, and recent developments in interest 

rates, total public expenditures are expected to 

increase by only 1.4%, a further slowdown 

compared to 2014. Regarding 2016, the rebound in 

inflation and the higher ta
x content of GDP growth 
are set to boost revenues despite the further 

reduction in social security contributions planned 

as part of the RSP. Meanwhile, the government 

intends to take measures to further reduce public 

expenditures. However, these remain largely 

unspecified and could thus not be fully 

incorporated in the for
ecast. Under a no-policy-
change assumption, the headline deficit in 2016 is 

set to decrease further to 3.5% of GDP. 
Overall, the structural balance is estimated to have 
improved by about ¾ pps. of GDP in 2014. In 

2015, in spite of the additional measures 

announced, the improvement would remain close 

to ¼ pp.  
The high government headline deficit and low 
nominal GDP growth are e
xpected to lead to a 
further increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, to 

97.0% of GDP by 2016.

  11. CROATIA 
External factors nudge the economy into a subdued recovery 
 86 The pick-up in activity signals the end of the 
recession, but uncertainty remains Croatia™s economy further contracted by 0.4% in 
2014. In the third quarter of 2014, seasonally 

adjusted GDP was up by 0.2% q-o-q, but stagnated 

again in the last quarter of 2014. Yet in year-on-

year terms, real GDP in the last quarter of 2014 

was up by 0.4%, the first expansion since the 

beginning of the recession in 2009. This timid 

recovery, however, remains fragile, as it relies 

exclusively on external demand. Exports of goods 

and services grew by slightly more than 6% in 

2014, but internal demand continued to drag on 

growth, with the rate of contraction even 

accelerating in the fourth quarter. 
High frequency indicators for the first quarter of 
2015 are sending mixed signals. On the positive 

side, sentiment indicators point towards an 

improvement in expectations, also confirmed by a 

pick-up in retail trade. In contrast, industrial 

production registered a steep fall of 4% in January, 

partially offset by a rebound in February. All in all, 

these indicators suggest that the economy should 
stagnate in the first quarter of 2015. 
The economy is set to simmer in 2015, on the 
back of the positive external environment  Croatia™s economy is expected to grow in 2015 at 
a modest rate of 0.3%. The marginal upward 

revision of 0.1 pp. since 
the previous forecast is 
attributable to the improved growth prospects in 

Croatia™s trading partners, partially offset by 

additional fiscal consolidation measures. Internal 

demand is expected to detract from growth for one 

more year, though the pa
ce of the contraction 
should gradually abate to
 -0.3%. In particular, 
investment is set to further contract by 1.8%, 

mainly as a result of the strong contraction 

registered in the last quarter of 2014, but also 

taking into account the planned withdrawal of 

profits from SOEs. In addition, low absorption of 

EU funds, on-going deleveraging pressures and 

weak private demand are set to still hold back 

investment activity in 2015. 
Despite continuing weak labour market 
performance, the contraction in private 

consumption is set to come to an end in 2015, 

thanks to the positive impact of reforms to 

personal income taxation and lower oil prices. 

Employment is set to stagnate in 2015, while the 

mild reduction of the unemployment rate to 17% 

will be driven by a reduction in the labour force. 
After a particularly strong 2014, exports are 
expected to grow by 3.7%, driven by improved 

cost-competitiveness and especially the 

acceleration of the recovery 
in the rest of the EU. 
On the back of weak internal demand, imports are 

expected to grow at a m
oderate pace of 2.4%, thus 
increasing Croatia™s current-account surplus. 
In 2015, price dynamics are expected to be almost 
flat, as opposed to the wi
nter forecast, due to the 
earlier-than-expected recove
ry in energy prices. 
Core inflation is expected to remain subdued due 

to weak demand.

 The long-awaited pick-up in investment is set 
to accelerate growth in 2016   Growth is set to pick-up somewhat to 1.2% in 
2016, as the contraction in all domestic demand 

components is expected to come to an end. 

Investment, in particular, is set to rebound as a 

result of increased absorpti
on of EU structural and 
After six years of recession, economic growth is set to creep into positive territory in 2015, thanks to 
external demand. In 2016 growth sh
ould accelerate to just above 1%
, as investments are expected to 
lead a mild recovery of internal demand. Employment nevertheless is set to stagnate, while the need for 

further consolidation of public finances in 2016 will weigh on Croatia™s fragile growth. 
Member States, Croatia 
  87 investment funds and improving expectations. Net 
external demand should continue contributing 

positively to GDP growth, though more 

moderately, as imports are set to accelerate. 
A slight increase in employment, in a context of a 
stable labour force, should result in a mild 

contraction of the unemployment rate to 16.6% in 

2016, while the acceleration of core inflation and 

the recovery of energy and commodity prices is set 

to spur HICP inflation to 1.3%. 
Risks to this forecast scen
ario are mainly tilted to 
the downside, as additional consolidation 

measures, necessary to rein in public finances and 

bring the general government debt on a sustainable 

path, could dampen from growth in 2016. 
A broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2015, with 
additional efforts needed in 2016 The general government deficit was 5.7% of GDP 
in 2014, compared to 5.4% in 2013. The slight 

deterioration was mostly caused by a decline of tax 

revenue, which more than offset an increase of 

social contributions due to
 the change of health 
contributions rate. Both indirect and direct tax 

revenues declined in 2014 reflecting the  
continually weak domestic economic activity. On 
the other hand, although expenditure increased 

only slightly, underlying developments of 

individual components were quite different; higher 

spending in social transfers and intermediate 

consumption was offset by lower expenditure on 

wages and subsidies.  
In 2015, the personal income tax rebate will be off-
set by consolidation measures presented in April, 

while the pick-up in growth should bring the 

budget deficit to 5.6% of GDP. In 2016, the deficit 

is forecast to remain broadly unchanged, in spite of 

the moderate pick-up in growth. After having 

attained -4.0% of GDP in
 2014, the structural 
deficit is therefore for
ecast to deteriorate only 
mildly in 2015 and more significantly in 2016  

(-0.2 and -0.5 pps. respectively). 
The ratio of general government debt to GDP grew 
by 4.5 pps. of GDP in 
2014 to reach 
85% at the 
end of the year. This was essentially the result of 

the budget deficit and minor stock adjustments in 

the environment of low nominal growth. In 2015 

and 2016, public debt is forecast to rise further to 

above 90% of GDP mainly as a result of 

underlying deficit trends.

  12. ITALY 
A gradual recovery ahead 
 88 The economy is set to return to growth in 2015 Real GDP contracted by 
0.4% in 2014, with a 
stabilisation in the final quarter of the year. 

However, the carry-over for change in real GDP in 

2015 remains marginally negative. While 

confidence indicators have steadily improved in 

recent months, the fluctuations of hard indicators 

suggest that the recovery 
should be gradual. Real 
GDP is expected to increase by 0.6% in 2015, with 

exports being the main driver of growth, aided by 

the depreciation of the 
euro. Although banks are 
still burdened with non-performing loans and real 

interest rates are projected to remain relatively 

high, the pick-up in export
s is forecast to slowly 
trigger new investment in equipment, as spare 

capacity wanes and credit conditions gradually 

improve. However, construction investment is set 

to continue contracting al
beit at a reduced pace. 
Private consumption is forecast to increase slightly 

as households restore their savings.  
The recovery is set to strengthen in 2016. Real 
GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 1.4% as 

Italy benefits from increasing external demand and 

investment picks up. In fact, the normalisation of 

financing conditions together with reduced 

uncertainty on economic prospects support higher 

private investment, including in construction. The 

current account balance is set to stabilise just 

above 2% of GDP over the 
forecast horizon, as the 
expected increase in investment is offset by higher 

savings. The sharp depreciation of the euro could 

feed into stronger-than-expected gains in 

competitiveness. This poses some upside risks to 

the baseline scenario fo
r exports and growth. 
Employment improves very gradually Even though output declined in 2014, both the 
number of people in employment and the number 

of hours worked increased.
 The social contribution 
exemption for new permanent hires in 2015 is 

expected to support headcount employment as 

firms have an incentive to bring forward 

recruitments to 2015. As recovery gathers strength, 

employment is projected to increase further in 
2016 (despite the absence 
of the employers™ social 
contributions incentive), in particular in terms of 

full-time equivalent. The unemployment rate is 

forecast to marginally dec
line in 2015 and stabilise 
in 2016, as previously discouraged people are 

expected to join the labour force. Upward pressure 

on labour costs is projected to remain limited 

thanks to the enacted cuts to the labour tax wedge, 

while labour productivity is forecast to improve. 

Nominal unit labour costs are thus set to stabilise.

 Inflation bottoms out in mid-2015  In 2015, the fall in energy 
prices is forecast to be 
partly counterbalanced by higher import prices for 

other goods and services resulting from the 

depreciation of the euro. As a result, HICP 

inflation is forecast at 
0.2% in 2015 and core 
inflation broadly stabilises at low levels. The HICP 

inflation forecast for 2016 of 1.8% incorporates a 

further increase in import 
prices, including energy, 
as well as the hike in VAT rates enshrined in the 

2015 budget law to safeguard the achievement of 

fiscal targets. In the 2015 Stability Programme, the 

government committed to 
partly replace the VAT 
hike with savings and lower tax expenditure that 

however will be detailed in the 2016 budget law. 
The government deficit is set to decline  The 2014 deficit was at 3% of GDP, slightly up 

from 2.9% in 2013. A fall in interest expenditure 
Supported by positive external factors, Italy™s economy is expected to return to growth in 2015 and the 
recovery to strengthen in 2016. Prices are forecast to remain broadly unchanged in 2015, while labour 

cost pressures remain limited. In 2015, the governmen
t deficit is projected to decline to 2.6% of GDP 
and public debt to peak at 133.1%. 
Member States, Italy 
  89 of around 0.2 pps. of GDP only partially offsets 
the erosion of the primary surplus. This was 

affected by negative real growth, low inflation, and 

reduced tax revenues from the financial sector. 

Primary expenditure incr
eased by 1.2% year-on-
year mainly due to tax credits to low-wage 

employees recorded as so
cial transfers, while 
revenues increased marginally more than nominal 

GDP, thanks to higher intakes from VAT and 

property taxation. In 2015, the deficit is projected 

to decline to 2.6% of GDP, supported by falling 

interest expenditure and a marginally higher 

primary surplus. In nominal terms, total primary 

expenditure is set to rise slightly (0.8% year-on-

year). Namely, current primary expenditure is 

projected to increase by 
1.3% mainly due to tax 
credits to low-wage employees and the extended 

coverage of unemployment benefits, while public 

wages remain frozen. Public investment is 

expected to continue contracting also due to 

expenditure savings at local level. Revenues are 

expected to increase less than nominal GDP 

because of the cuts to 
the labour tax wedge. The 
structural balance is se
t to improve by around 
¼ pps. of GDP in 2015. In 2016, under a no-policy 

change assumption, the de
ficit is projected to 
narrow further to 2.0% of GDP, while the 

structural balance slightly 
worsens. Risks to these  
budgetary projections are related to possible 
additional expansionary measures announced in 

the 2015 Stability Programme but not yet detailed.

  13. CYPRUS 
Progress on structural reforms promises new steam to a delayed 
economic recovery 
 90 The recession continued into 2014 but at a 
more moderate pace– Despite renewed weakness in real GDP growth 
towards the end of the year, the recession lost 

some of its grip on the economy, with the GDP 

decline easing to 2.3% in 
2014 as a whole. This 
represents a substantially
 milder recession than 
that of 2013 when the economy contracted by 

5.4%. The improvement is largely due to an 

increase in private consum
ption, which more than 
offset the decline in other domestic demand 

components. However, the increase in private 

consumption mainly reflects a base effect 

following its sharp contraction in 2013. Imports 

also rose significantly, fo
llowing a sharp decline in 
2013, outweighing a nevertheless solid increase in 

exports. As a result, the contribution of net exports 

to growth was negative in 2014.  
Unemployment increased ma
rginally in 2014, as 
the reduction in employment was largely offset by 

a fall in the labour force. HICP inflation turned 

negative in 2014, as energy prices decreased 

strongly in end-2014 while inflationary pressure 

remained weak, on the ba
ck of downward wage 
adjustments and low rates of capacity utilisation. 
–however, 2015 will still see negative growth. Although available short-term indicators for 

economic activity in the beginning of 2015 suggest 

a slowly improving growth momentum, the 

economy is not expected to grow before 2016. 

Despite low oil prices, domestic demand is 

forecast to contribute nega
tively to growth, which, 
together with a modest negative contribution from 

net exports, will lead to a real GDP contraction by 

0.5%. Unemployment is forecast to remain broadly 

stable, reflecting a further adjustment of the labour 

force, and low energy prices will keep HICP 

inflation in negative territory in 2015.  
The growth momentum will gradually pick up 
in 2016– In 2016, the gradual deleveraging of both 
households and corporates should remove 

impediments to a more balanced growth. At the 

same time, the insolvency and foreclosure 

framework adopted in April 2015 should allow for 

more effective tools to deal with the high ratio of 

non-performing loans and will help restore the 

health of the banking sector, loosen credit supply 

conditions and support a moderate pick-up in 

domestic demand. The ensuing growth momentum 

is expected to gradually
 ease unemployment. HICP 
inflation is forecast to tu
rn positive in
 2016, as 
energy prices rebound. -15

 –with risks remaining on the downside. Risks to the recovery remain tilted to the 
downside. A failure to address high NPL ratios 

could lead to a more prolonged period of tight 

credit supply conditions, stalling the recovery of 

investment and weakening domestic demand. On 

the external side, the recession in Russia could 

have larger negative effects on exports than 

anticipated. The recession moderated significantly in 2014 with the second half of the year being weaker than the 
first. Low oil prices are expected to support growth in 2015 but external demand will still be exposed to 

headwinds from the Russian economy. Recent progress
 on structural reforms should underpin the 
economic recovery. Fiscal adjustm
ent is expected to continue. 
Member States, Cyprus 
  91 Strong fiscal adjustment continues In 2014, both the primar
y and the headline balance 
for the general government improved by about 

4.5% of GDP, on the back of consolidation 

measures and prudent budget execution, excluding 

the impact of a one-off banking recapitalisation 

amounting to 8.6% of GDP. The revenue ratio 

increased compared to 2013, driven by 

consolidation measures, high dividends from the 

Central Bank of Cyprus, and improved tax 

collection. These factors more than offset the 

negative impact of reduced private consumption 

and adverse labour market developments. Total 

expenditure net of one-off banking recapitalisation 

costs decreased reflecting tight expenditure 

control, measures to reduce the public sector wage 

bill as well as a decelera
tion in the public sector 
retirement wave resulting in lower cost for  

lump-sum pension payments. 
The general government balance is expected to 
worsen in 2015, when the one-off effects from  
banking recapitalisation in 2014 are excluded. This 
reflects the prolonged economic recession, 

impacting mostly on tax revenues, but also other 

factors, such as location rules regarding VAT for 

e-commerce services and a decrease in dividend 

income from the Central Bank of Cyprus. In 2016, 

the general government balance is forecast to 

improve in line with better economic conditions. 
The structural balance is 
expected to remain in 
positive territory over the 
entire forecast horizon. 
The worsening in 2015 is driven by the decrease in 

both general government balance and potential 

GDP. In 2016, the structural
 balance is expected to 
stay nearly unchanged, despite an improved 

general government balance, due to a decreasing 

output gap as growth picks up. The debt-to-GDP 

ratio is expected to increase slightly over the 

forecast horizon.   mio EURCurr. prices% GDP95-10201120122013201420152016

Growth momentum sustained by domestic demand 
 92 Resilient growth despite external shocks Real GDP growth slowed to 2.4% in 2014 after 
having exceeded 4% over 
the last three years. The 
slowdown largely reflects the negative external 

economic shock from developments in Russia. 

Economic sentiment indicators have gradually 

worsened over the past y
ear but remain above their 
long-term averages. The growth outlook for 2015 

is expected to be overshadowed by the fallout from 

economic turbulence in Ru
ssia, which constrains 
production and business investment in some 

sectors. Real GDP growth 
is forecast to gradually 
accelerate from 2.3% in 2015 to 3.2% in 2016, 

assuming a revival of economic sentiment and a 

recovery in the euro area. However, risks remain 

tilted to the downside due to the high uncertainty 

of the external environment.

Latvia -Real GDP growth and contributions
 Household consumption holding up growth Growth is expected to be driven by household 
consumption, which is held up by strong income 

growth and lower oil prices. The latter implies a 

significant boost to household real incomes given 

that fuel and heating co
sts account for about 10% 
of household spending. This appears to be 

confirmed by the strength of retail trade volumes 

in early 2015. Private investment growth is 

expected to remain suppressed in 2015 due to 
uncertainties about the external outlook and a 
slowdown in the real estate market. However, 

assuming that these uncer
tainties abate in 2016, 
investment, along with household consumption, 

should accelerate. 
Exporters shifting markets The sharp depreciation of the Russian rouble and 

trade sanctions are adve
rsely affecting some 
exporters and tourism. About one tenth of Latvian 

exports of goods are dir
ected to Russia. Trade 
statistics suggest that the drop in exports to Russia 

has been partly offset by strong growth in 

electronics and wood industries. Export growth is 

forecast to accelerate in 
2016 when the decline in 
exports to Russia is assumed to have bottomed out 

and demand from the EU strengthens. As a 

significant share of exporte
rs is integrated into 
global production chains through EU 

manufacturers, the euro™s depreciation should 

support Latvia™s exports via its main EU trading 

partners. As a positive development, Latvia™s 

largest steel factory is set to resume production in 

2015, boosting both export and import volumes. 

Nevertheless, a slightly negative net export is 

projected in 2015 and 2016, given that strong 

household consumption should drive up imports. 
Dwindling workforce affecting labour market National accounts data show a sudden 1.4% fall in 

employment in 2014. However, data on the 

number of taxpayers and occupied posts suggest 

that employment was more stable. The divergence 

is related to methodological changes in statistics. 

Unemployment continued to decline over 2014 to 

10.8% of the labour force. Labour market 

outcomes are influenced by the significant decline 

in the working age population. Employment 

growth is thus expected to remain modest in 2015 

and 2016 even as labour demand increases. At the 

same time, unemployment is projected to continue 

to fall to 9.4% in 2016. The tightening of the 

labour market and the minimum wage hike in 2015 

are building up wage pressures. 
The fall in fuel prices and the strong rise in household incomes are set to sustain private consumption. 
However, the growth outlook for 20
15 is expected to be overshadowed
 by the fallout from economic 
turbulence in Russia. Unemployment is set to drop further in 2015 and 2016, but the shrinking 

population is dampening the employment outlook. The government deficit remains at around 1½% of 

GDP over the forecast horizon. 
Member States, Latvia 
  93 One-off factors influence inflation HICP inflation is caught between opposing forces. 
On the one hand, lower fuel prices are estimated to 

directly cut inflation by over 1 pp. and also lead to 

lower heating prices with a lag. On the other, 

household electricity pri
ces increased strongly 
after deregulation took effect in January 2015, 

pushing up inflation by 0.8 pps. Also, an increase 

in public transport prices will add to inflation by 

about 0.3 pps. in 2015. Overall, HICP inflation is 

forecast to remain low in 2015 at 0.7% before 

accelerating in 2016 to 2.2%, assuming a recovery 

in global oil prices. Core inflation, however, looks 

significantly higher in 2015, due to strong wage 

growth and the depreciation of the euro. 
Weaker fiscal outlook The general government deficit stood at 1.4% of 

GDP in 2014, including a one-off payment to the 

European Bank for Reconstruction and 

Development for bank restructuring related 

expenses during the crisis (0.4% of GDP).  
The 2015 deficit is estimated at 1.4% of GDP, 
worse than in the winter forecast mostly due to 

lower tax revenues. Tax revenues were below their 
budget targets in the first quarter of 2015 and this 
shortfall is expected to pe
rsist in full-year, in line 
with the revised GDP projections. 
The 2016 deficit is proj
ected at 1.6% of GDP, 
including an additional defence spending of 0.3% 

of GDP announced in the stability programme. The 

tax-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease due to a 

scheduled personal income tax cut by 1 pp. and the 

shift in social security contributions to private 

pension schemes from 5% in 2015 to 6% in 2016. 

However, insufficient details are specified on the 

announced progressive differentiation of the 

personal income tax basic allowance for it to be 

included in the forecast. The current expenditure 

growth rate is expected to be similar to that in 

2015, with social expenditure expanding in line 

with indexation rules and public wage growth 

tracking the private sector
. Capital spending is 
projected to be impacted by a slow roll-out of the 

new EU funded projects. Latvia™s structural deficit 

is estimated to increase 
from about 1½% of GDP 
in 2014 to 2% in 2015 and 2¼% in 2016.  
Government debt is proj
ected at about 37% of 
GDP in 2015, but increasing to some 40% in 2016, 

mainly due to the build-up of the cash resource for 

a large repayment in early 2017.

Domestic demand keeps the economy on course  94 Weaker yet still robust economic performance 
in 2014– Real GDP grew by 2.9% in 2014, a slower pace 
than in 2013, as the Russian crisis weakened 

exports and investment significantly in the second 

half of the year. However, private consumption 

continued to grow strongly as falling 

unemployment, rising wages, disinflation, 

triggered by the falling oil price, increased 

consumers' disposable income.

 –is set to continue in 2015, and strengthen in 
2016 led by private demand. Real GDP growth is forecast to remain broadly 
stable at 2.8% in 2015 and to pick up to 3.3% in 

2016. Domestic demand, in particular private 

consumption, is expected to remain the driving 

force as both employment and wages are forecast 

to increase, while inflation is set to remain low. 

Investment spending is forecast to stay subdued in 

2015 due to continued geopolitical uncertainties. 

Only towards the end of the forecast horizon is 

investment expected to improve on the back of 

high capacity utilisation, the resumption of growth 

in the EU, and the use of EU structural funds. 
Net exports are forecast to
 reduce real GDP growth 
by 0.9 pps. and 1.0 pp. in 2015 and 2016, 
respectively. Robust private consumption and 
gradual pickup in investment spending are set to 

lift imports; however exports are expected to 

remain subdued during 2015 due to weak demand 

from Russia. Export growth is forecast to 

accelerate in 2016 as exporters are expected to 

redirect goods and services to other markets and 

demand from the EU strengthens.  
As employment is set to continue expanding, the 
annual average unemployment rate is forecast to 

improve further, albeit at a slower pace than in 

2014, falling to 9.9% in 2015 and 9.1% in 2016. 
Decline in energy prices is set to push inflation 
below zero Average annual HICP inflation slowed in 2014 to 
0.2%, and is expected to fall further to -0.4% in 

2015, largely because of th
e decline in energy and 
unprocessed food prices. In
flation in the services 
sector is likely to accelerate on the back of 

sustained wage growth. For 2016, HICP inflation 

is expected to grow again 
by 1.7% as the effect of 
the fall in oil prices fades out. 
Credit growth continues to disappoint Despite a small pick-up in mortgage lending and 

consumer credit, overall cr
edit remained flat in 
2014. Weak credit demand and strict lending 

conditions appear to be the main factors behind 

sluggish credit growth. Demand is expected to pick 

up due to increased investment spending towards 

the end of the forecast horizon. 
Risks to the forecast are broadly balanced. A 
continuation or worsening of tensions with Russia 

could delay a pick-up in investment and exports, 

while a stronger-than expected recovery in the EU 

could work in the opposite direction. 
Fiscal improvement set to pause in 2015 In 2014, the general government deficit dropped to 

0.7% of GDP from 2.6% of GDP in 2013. Tax 

revenues were slightly higher than planned by the 
Lithuania™s economy is expected to maintain growth of 2.8% in 2015, despite a fall in exports to Russia. 
With employment and real disposable incomes rising, domestic demand is expected to remain the main 

growth engine. Expected pick up in investment is set to boost real GDP growth to 3.3% in 2016. 

Inflation remains low. The improvement in public finances is expected to pause in 2015. 
Member States, Lithuania 
  95 government, while general government 
expenditures and the deficit of the social insurance 

fund, SoDra, were lower. In addition, the deposit 

insurance fund achieved a surplus of 1.2% of GDP 

on account of liquidation proceeds, while the law 

on pension compensation following a 

Constitutional Court ruling added 0.8% of GDP on 

the expenditure side. 
In 2015, the general government deficit is 
estimated to increase to 1.5% of GDP, largely 

because of higher social 
spending (0.2 pps.) and a 
substantial increase in defence expenditure 

(0.3 pps.) not covered by new revenue measures. 

In addition, tax revenues are expected to grow 

slowly, due to lower-than-expected nominal GDP 

growth in 2015. 
Under a no-policy-change assumption, the general 
government deficit is forecas
t to return to 0.9% of 
GDP in 2016, mainly on the back of robust 

economic growth and the ex
pected limited increase 
in expenditures. Risks to the forecast are on the  
downside, in particular for 2015 as the Lithuanian 
government might decide compensate public wage 

cuts executed during th
e economic crisis and 
considered unlawful by the constitutional court. If 

enacted, this would incr
ease the 2015 deficit by 
around 0.3 pps. 
Lithuania™s structural deficit is estimated to have 
decreased from about 2¼% of GDP in 2013 to 

about 1¼% in 2014. A deterioration is expected for 

2015 due to the additional expenditure measures, 

while in 2016 the structural deficit is expected to 

fall back to about 1¼% of GDP. 
General government debt increased from 38.8% of 
GDP in 2013 to 40.9% in 2014, due to the  

pre-financing of bond redemptions. In 2015, debt 

will edge to 41.7% of GDP due to higher-than-

usual pre-financing of EU fund expenditures and 

the end of year pre-financing of 2016 bond 

redemptions. Lithuania™s debt is set to fall to 

37.3% of GDP in 2016 as the pre-financing ends.

Luxembourg -Real GDP growth and contributions
 Successful transition of the financial sector Looking forward, soft and hard indicators signal a 
firming recovery. Luxembourg is well positioned 

to benefit from favourable changes underway in 

the external economic environment. The 

profitability of the country™s main growth engine, 

the financial sector, suffer
ed in recent years due to 
the adjustment to new regulatory financial 

standards but this transition can be considered now 

as almost completed. At the same time, the 

investment fund industry is gaining momentum, 

also boosted by the ECB™s non-conventional 

monetary policy measures. Against this 

background and in light of the expected 

improvement in the external economic 

environment, output growth 
is expected to pick up 
to 3.4% in 2015 and to 
accelerate marginally to 
3.5% in 2016. 
On the demand side, lower oil prices and positive 
employment prospects will continue to support 

household purchasing power and private 

consumption. However, consolidation measures in 

the 2015 budget, includ
ing a 2 pps. increase in 
VAT rates, act in the opposite direction, 

temporarily dampening household spending 

growth. As the economy picks up and the effect of 

the VAT hike fades, private consumption is 

projected to accelerate in
 2016. As capacity 
utilisation remains low, the gradually improving 

external environment and 
the Investment Plan for 
Europe, combined with more accommodative 

credit conditions, are likely to provide only a mild 

boost to investment growth in 2015, although an 

acceleration is projected in 2016. Public 

investment, by contrast, is expected to surge by 

more than 10% this year, mainly due to the 

execution of large infrastructure projects. 
The contribution of net exports to growth is 
expected to remain highly positive in 2015, backed 

by the sustained performance of services and 

despite the acceleration of imports. As global 

economic conditions gradually improve, external 

trade should gather further strength in 2016. 
In 2014, employment increased by 2.4%. Labour 
creation was buoyant in most sectors, and growth 

of frontier workers return
ed to outpace that of 
residents. Overall, labour market prospects are 

projected to remain positive, with employment 

growth set to average around 2½% per year over 

the forecast horizon, driv
en by the solid economic 
outlook. The unemployment rate is expected to 

start declining already in 
2015 and to further drop 
in 2016, reflecting the dynamism of economic 

activity. 
Looking for a stable regulatory environment  The main risk relates to the financial sector™s 

capacity to protect its 
comparative advantages 
amid risks of significant shifts in the regulatory 

environment.  
Luxembourg™s economy is projected to grow by 3.4% th
is year and further accelerate to 3.5% next year. 
Growth is expected to be balanced, with almost equal contribution from domestic demand and net 

export. In line with robust job creation, the unemployment rate is projected to decline while inflation 

will remain subdued despite a rise in VAT rates. Public finances are projected to remain in balance, 

despite the drop in VAT revenues, linked to a ch
ange in EU legislation 
related to e-commerce. 
Member States, Luxembourg 
  97 Inflation set to remain low, in spite of the 
increase in VAT rates,  In 2014, inflation averaged
 just 0.7%. In December 
headline inflation dipped below zero for the first 

time in several years and remained negative in the 

first quarter of this year. Overall, in 2015 it is 

expected that the sharp fall in oil prices will offset 

the impact of the legislated rise in VAT rates, 

leading to an annual HICP
 inflation rate of 0.8%. 
Inflation, however, should bounce back to 2.1% in 

2016, in line with sustained demand and also 

boosted by the quantitative easing programme of 

the ECB. 
The government balance weakens in 2015 In 2014, the general gover
nment surplus came in at 0.6% of GDP compared to 0.9% in 2013. In 2015, 

the general government balance is expected to 

further weaken, mostly due to a change in EU 

legislation on e-commerce services. According to 

the new rules, VAT on sales of e-commerce 

services will accrue to 
the country where the 
consumer is located and not any longer to the 

country where the supplier is
 established. This will 
entail for the government a drop in VAT revenues 

estimated at around 1½% of GDP.  
The implementation of measures in the most recent 
consolidation package, incl
uding the  hike of all 
VAT rates by 2 pps., the new ‚impôt d™équilibrage 

budgétaire temporaire™ levied on personal income 

and the implementation of measures from the 

expenditure review will improve the government™s 

accounts by around 1.0%
 of GDP, therefore 
substantially, but not fully, compensating for the 

loss. Nevertheless, the upward revision of the 

macro-economic scenario is expected to boost 

fiscal revenues while low inflation will help in 

containing expenditure. All in all, the headline 

balance in 2015 is projected to turn into a balanced 

budget. This also factors in a sharp increase of 

public investment in infrastructure projects. 
In 2016, the incrementa
l effect of measures 
adopted with the 2015 budget should further 

strengthen government™s finances and lead to a 

small surplus. The surplus of the government™s 

structural balance is expected to narrow by 1% of 

GDP in 2015 and broadly stabilise in 2016. 
In spite of a regular primary surplus, the debt-to-
GDP ratio is set to increase to 25.3% of GDP over 

the forecast horizon, mirroring developments in 

the deficit of the central government.

  17. HUNGARY 
Deceleration in growth, a switch from investment to consumption 
 98 Better-than-expected GDP in 2014 but weaker 
growth dynamics lies ahead In 2014, the Hungarian economy grew by 3.6%, 
well above government and market expectations 

thanks to domestic demand, which contributed 

4.0 pps. to growth, while net exports weighed it 

down by 0.4 pps. Within domestic demand, gross 

capital formation was the main contributor. The 

surge in both public and private investment was 

supported by the accelerat
ed absorption of EU 
funds and the central bank™s Funding for Growth 

Scheme of subsidised loans to SMEs. On the 

production side, all sectors contributed to growth: 

industrial production (which contributed 1.5 pps.), 

the service sector (1.1
 pps.) and agriculture 
(0.5 pps.). 
Signs of a slowdown in GDP were already visible 
in the second half of 2
014. The deceleration in 
growth is projected to continue throughout the 

forecast horizon as the impact of high EU fund 

inflows (see below) and of the subsidised loan 

scheme fade away. GDP is set to expand by 2.8% 

in 2015 and 2.2% in 2016. Domestic demand is 

expected to remain the main driver of economic 

growth, but with a shift from investment to private 

consumption. New mortgage rules are expected to 

raise households' real disposable income as banks 

will have to reimburse revenues considered to have 

been unfairly collected. In 
addition, in a context of 
low inflation, real wages are projected to increase 

throughout the forecast horizon. From 2016, only 

the structural funds from the new Multiannual 

Financial Framework period will be available, 

implying a significant drop in EU fund inflows, 

weighing on investment activity. Export growth is 

forecast to increase and net exports will contribute 

to growth in 2015 and even more in 2016. The 

country's current account su
rplus is expected to 
increase further throughou
t the forecast horizon. 
Unemployment should continue to fall while 
inflation gradually picks up In2014, the unemployment ra
te decreased to a low 
of 7.7% and is forecast to decline further. With 
real growth being high, private sector job creation 
was significant in 2014 and this is set to continue, 

albeit to a lesser extent. The employment rate is 

expected to keep on growing, and so will the 

activity rate. Employment gains should also be 

supported by public works, which are planned to 

be further increased.  
Inflation in 2014 turned out to be 0%, and stood at 
-0.6% in March 2015. This is due to subdued 

imported inflation, low food prices, regulated 

energy price cuts and while inflation expectations 

were declining. In the second half of 2015, 

inflation is expected to turn positive as these 

effects diminish and the inflation for the year as a 

whole will be close to zero. As the output gap 

closes, inflationary pressures from the real 

economy will drive up inflation to 2.5% in 2016. 
More risks on the upside Improved confidence stemming from the current 

strong growth and investments could lead to higher 

gross fixed capital formation and consumption. 

Lending flows and investments could be further 

supported by a full take-up of the Funding for 

Growth Scheme (recently extended to cover riskier 

SMEs) as well as by the full implementation of the 

announced policy commitments towards the 

financial sector. Sunday closure of retail stores 

could lower consumption for a short period. 
The general government deficit is projected to 
decrease below 2.5% of GDP The general government deficit reached 2.6% of 
GDP in 2014, i.e. 0.3 pp. below the government 

target. Tax and social secu
rity receipts as a whole 
exceeded the budgeted nu
mber by 0.9% of GDP 
thanks to the strong economic recovery and 

improvements in tax ad
ministration. The extra 
revenues were partly absorbed by additional 

spending, while the switch to ESA2010 accounting 

resulted in a deterioration of the headline figure.  
Hungary™s real GDP grew by an impressive 3.6% in 2014, but is set to slow down to more sustainable 
levels of 2.8% in 2015 an
d 2.2% in 2016 as growth
-supporting factors, such as a record EU funds 
absorption, lose strength. Unemployment has fallen significantly and is expected to continue decreasing, 

while inflation is forecast to bottom out this year. The general government deficit will remain firmly 

below 3% of GDP over the forecast horizon. 
Member States, Hungary 
  99 The 2015 deficit is fo
recast at 2.5% of GDP. 
Expenditure increases incorporated in the April 

amendment of the budget ar
e projected to be more 
than offset by the improved revenue outlook since 

the winter forecast due to the more favourable base 

effects and higher consumption growth. Compared 

to the previous year, inte
rest outlays are expected 
to decrease considerab
ly, but it is largely 
counterbalanced by the dete
rioration in the primary 
balance. This also refl
ects the deficit-increasing 
impact stemming from the assumed shortfall of 

budgeted one-off revenues from asset sales, a 

measure which remains unspecified by the 

authorities. 
The government deficit is 
projected to decrease to 
2.2% of GDP in 2016, which is based on a no-

policy change assumption as the new convergence 

programme was not released by the cut-off date of 

the forecast. The phas
ing-out of temporary 
expenditure items, the projected savings in social 

transfers and a further reduction in interest outlays 

would contribute to the lowering of the deficit. 

This is expected to be partly offset by revenue-

decreasing measures amounting to some 0.3% of 

GDP, of which two-thirds are linked to the 

reduction of the bank levy.  
Overall, budgetary risks are rather tilted towards a 
lower deficit over the forecast horizon, which is 

related to potential favourable developments on the 

revenue side. The outturn data for the first quarter 

of 2015 point to an upward risk in tax receipts, 

while further revenue gains may also arise from 

recent measures combatting VAT avoidance. On 

the negative side, EU-funded projects should be 

mentioned as both the pending financial 

corrections and the domestic financing 

requirements (linked to the overbooking of the 

available envelopes to ensure maximum 

absorption) may turn out higher than currently 

planned. 
The structural balance is estimated to have 
deteriorated by 1¼ pp. in 2014 to -2½% of GDP, 

and then to broadly stabilise at this level. In 2014, 

despite the solid nominal GDP growth and the low 

deficit, the government debt-to-GDP ratio 

decreased only by 0.4 pps. to 76.9%. The limited 

reduction was chiefly due to the weakening of the 

exchange rate. With the assumed re-strengthening 

of the forint and unchanged state deposits, the debt 

ratio is forecast to decline by more than 1 pp. 

annually in both 2015 and 2016, decreasing below 

74% of GDP by the end of
 the forecast horizon.

 –and is projected to remain strong– After reaching 3.5% for the year as a whole in 
2014, real GDP growth 
is forecast to accelerate 
slightly to 3.6% in 2015 before moderating to 

3.2% in 2016. The main drivers of growth over 

2015 and 2016, similar to 2014, are projected to be 

investment, benefiting from a number of  

large-scale construction an
d energy projects and 
EU fund absorption (mostly in 2015), and private 

consumption, on the back of increasing disposable 

incomes and favourable consumer sentiment. 

Falling interest rates, bringing about a reduction in 

the cost of financing for fi
rms, are expected to ease 
access to finance for firms, 
in particular for micro 
and small enterprises. Banks™ lending standards, 

however, remain tight. 
Risks related to this macroeconomic forecast are 
broadly balanced. Delays in the energy investment 

projects could result in lower-than-expected 

economic growth. At the sa
me time, stronger-than-
expected responsiveness of the export sector, 
particularly for services, to the euro depreciation 

could provide a further boost to exports.

%% –reflecting also robust job creation– Employment growth surprised positively in 2014, 
reflecting also a strong increase in public sector 

jobs. It is projected to moderate somewhat 

thereafter, but to remain well above the euro-area 

average and thereby effectively contributing to 

economic growth. Unempl
oyment is forecast to 
continue edging down and to average 5.9% over 

the forecast horizon. 
–while inflation is projected to rebound. Price inflation in Malta is 
forecast to exceed that in

expiration of the base effect from the reduction in 

electricity tariffs for households in 2014 as well as 

the euro depreciation, of

pressures on international markets, are projected to 

result in a rebound in HICP inflation to 1.3% in 

2015. A rebound in energy prices in 2016 is 

projected to contribute to a further increase in 

overall HICP inflation to 1.9%.

Economic growth is projected to remain robust over the forecast period, driven by strong domestic 
demand. Job creation and the unemployment rate are projected to outperform euro-area peers. The 

favourable macroeconomic outlook is set to result in a further decline in the budget deficit. 
Member States, Malta 
  101 explained by the higher current revenue, by 
1.5 pps. of GDP, due to both the favourable 

macroeconomic outlook and higher intakes from 

government measures. Among these measures, the 

regularisation scheme 
for past irregular 
declarations of income amounted to 0.4% of GDP. 

Current expenditure is reported to have increased 

by 7.3% year-on-year in nominal terms (up by 

0.8 pps. of GDP), driven by higher spending for 

public wages, intermediate consumption and 

subsidies (including to the public transport system) 

and net capital expenditure linked to EU funds.  
The 2015 Budget, delivered in November, pursues 
fiscal consolidation mainly by way of revenue-

increasing measures while envisaging several 

social measures, which are only partly 

compensated by some restraint on public wages. 

Overall, the current revenu
e ratio is projected to 
increase by 0.4 pps. of GDP (including the 

International Investor Programme). On the 

expenditure side, current expenditure is expected 

to remain stable in terms of GDP. Net capital 

expenditure is set to increase marginally in terms  
of GDP since higher subsidies (due to a further 
capital injection into Air Malta of 0.5% of GDP) 

are compensated by lower net co-financed 

investments. Overall, in 2015 the deficit is 

expected to narrow to 1.8% of GDP and to further 

decrease to 1.5% of GDP in 2016, on a no-policy-

change assumption, also 
thanks to favourable 
nominal GDP growth and the expected decrease in 

net capital expenditure.  
The structural deficit improved by more than 1 pp. 
of GDP in 2013 and is estimated to have remained 

stable in 2014. It is projected to improve by ½ pp. 

of GDP in both 2015 and 2016. 
In 2014, also thanks to the expected repayment of 
tax arrears from Enemalta (the public energy 

utility corporation), the debt ratio decreased to 

68.0% of GDP and is proj
ected to further decrease 
to 65.4% of GDP by 2016.  
Downside risks are linked to higher-than-expected 
subsidies to Malta™s new public transport service 

provider.

  19. THE NETHERLANDS 
Economic recovery finally gains ground 
 102 Growth has been firming  Recent data show that the Dutch economy grew at 
a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the third quarter of 2014 

and 0.8% in the fourth quarter. Relatively strong 

consumption growth and a recovery in investment 

activity, in particular in the construction sector, 

contributed to these developments. Over the course 

of 2014, both housing and labour markets 

improved, providing a boost to economic 

sentiment.  
Strengthening domestic demand working in 
tandem with a weak euro According to soft indicat
ors as well as the most 
recent data for GDP components, industrial 

production and the labour market, the economic 

recovery is projected to c
ontinue in 2015. Over the 
forecast horizon, substantial growth in real 

disposable income is expected to support 

consumption growth. Although pressures to reduce 

household debt are expected to abate slightly, they 

will continue to limit consumption growth in the 

years to come and to give 
rise to an increase in the 
savings rate of households. Investment activity is 

set to recover on the back of the improved general 

economic conditions. Largely fuelled by the expiry 

of a temporary tax break, construction investment 

surged in the final months of 2014, leading to 

strong annual growth of 5.6%. Over the course of 

2015 and 2016, investment in construction is 

expected to maintain much of the momentum and 

grow by around 4% annually. Investment in 

equipment is assumed to ha
ve reached a through in 
2014 and is expected to rebound to a growth rate 

above 5% in 2015 and 2016, on the back of higher 

profit margins and the improved growth outlook. 

Despite these expectations, total investment is 

forecast to remain substa
ntially below pre-crisis 
levels over the entire for
ecast horizon, as capacity 
utilisation rates are low compared to long term 

averages and commercial
 real estate markets 
remain depressed. The already buoyant export-

oriented sectors of the Dutch economy are 

benefiting from the added stimulus provided by the 
weakening of the exchange rate of the euro. Rising 
domestic demand is expected to lead to substantial 

import growth as the economic cycle matures, 

resulting in a relatively small contribution of net 

exports to economic growth in 2015 and 2016. 

Overall, GDP is expected to grow by 1.6% in 2015 

and 1.7% in 2016.

 Labour market boosted by the economic 
recovery Labour market conditions have been improving 
over the last year, with both the number of new 

vacancies and total employment steadily 

increasing. These trends are set to continue in line 

with the strengthening of domestic production, 

leading to increasing demand for labour. The 

unemployment rate is expected to decline only 

gradually, as more people enter the labour market 

adding to the growth of the labour force.  
Inflation gradually returns from below zero HICP dipped below zero in the first three months 

of 2015. However, risks of a prolonged period of 

negative inflation are contained, as inflationary 
pressures are expected to rise somewhat, stoked by 

robust wage growth and a depreciating euro. The 

slight increase in oil prices and rising domestic 

demand should also prevent prices from falling 
The economy of the Netherlands grew
 strongly in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by domestic 
consumption and a jump in investment. Early indicators suggest that domestic demand should 

strengthen further in 2015 and that the export sector should benefit from the depreciation of the euro. 

HICP inflation is expected to bottom out at 0.2% th
is year before increasing above 1% next year. The 
general government deficit is expected to fall to 1.7% in 2015 and 1.2% in 2016. 
Member States, The Netherlands 
  103 further. All in all, inflation is expected to bottom 
out in early 2015 and to increase steadily 

thereafter, leading to annu
al average inflation of 
0.2% in 2015 and 1.3% in 2016.  
Headline deficit set to improve further In 2014, the headline general government budget 

deficit came out at 2.3% of GDP. For 2015 and 

2016, it is set to decrease to 1.7% and 1.2% of 

GDP, respectively, mainly due to improving 

macroeconomic conditions but also due to 

consolidation measures take
n in recent years. The 
strong pickup in domestic demand will lead to a 

tax-rich economic recovery. The government has 

also limited the tax-deductibility of contributions 

to the second pension pillar, increasing revenues 

from the personal income tax and improving the 

budget balance. Important budgetary savings come 

from lower healthcare expenditure (over 0.3% of 

GDP). The decentralisation of parts of long-term 

care to municipalities and cuts in public 

expenditure in this area are expected to result in a 

further improvement of public finances. Finally, 

the lower price of natural gas and the reduction of  
production ceilings have a negative impact on the 
government's finances. The effect of the reduction 

of the production ceilings on the budget are limited 

(less than 0.05% of GDP in 2015 and 2016), 

whereas the effect of the 
drop in the gas price is 
more substantial (around 0.2% of GDP). 
The structural deficit is expected to hover around 
½% of potential GDP in both 2015 and 2016. The 

gross government debt ratio is forecast to peak just 

below 70% of GDP in 2015 before starting to 

decline in 2016.  
Risks to the fiscal forecast are largely balanced and 
mirror macroeconomic ri
sks, although the 
volatility of revenues from the production of 

natural gas may create additional uncertainties. 

With more stringent rules on the public finances of 

local governments in place, the budget cuts 

implemented as part of the decentralisation of 

some long-term care expenditure appear to be 

achievable. Finally, a possible re-privatisation of 

parts of ABN-Amro is not
 included in the forecast 
but could have positive effects on the debt ratio of 

the government.

  20. AUSTRIA 
Lingering uncertainty hampers a stronger rebound 
 104 Lingering weakness Austria™s economic growth hardly picked up in 
2014. The dynamics of activity were uneven but 

weak across all sectors. Exports continued to grow 

at a subdued rate, so the contribution of foreign 

trade to growth turned negative. The slight 

increase in domestic demand was supported by a 

short-lived, tax-related investment rally early in 

2014 and by public consumption and otherwise 

reflects developments in 2013, rather than the 

current situation. 
Fragile outlook subject to uncertainty No tangible acceleration of growth is expected in 

the early quarters of 2015 and thus GDP growth 

for the year as a whole is expected to be around 

0.8%. Business and consumer sentiment indicators 

for the beginning of th
e year indicate more 
weakness over the next few months. 
GDP growth in 2016 is forecast to strengthen to 
1.5%, essentially supported by domestic demand, 

although this will also depend on a pick-up in 

international trade and a more vigorous response 

from investment and consumption to supportive 

factors such as the low interest rate environment. 

The latest monetary policy measures are expected 

to favour both these channels. The low interest rate 

environment is supportive of investment, but 

capacity utilisation rates and order-book levels 

indicate some degree of slack. Low interest rates 

are also forecast to benefit housing demand, 

which, together with rising house prices in recent 

years, are expected to revive construction activity. 
The evolution of foreign 
demand over the forecast 
horizon is set to present opportunities for Austrian 

exporters, who have broadly maintained 

productivity growth, and enable them to benefit 

from their strong integration in international 

production chains. However, subdued investment 

over the last three years may have left Austrian  
companies less well placed 
to profit from such a 
recovery. The improving outlook for exports is 

nevertheless expected to help restart investment 

growth. With both exports and imports picking up, 

net exports are projected to contribute positively to 

growth in 2015-16, unlike in 2014. Slowing 

inflation and a stable labour
 market are expected to 
support consumer purchasing power until growth 

consolidates and sentiment improves in 2016. The 

income tax relief taking effect next year is 

expected to lead to 
an increase of both 
consumption and household savings. 
Consumption supported by a stable labour 
market With sluggish economic activity, employment 
growth was just below 1% in 2014, supported by 

job creation in service 
sectors. Employers™ 
expectations suggest jo
b creation could remain 
slow in 2015 but it is projected to pick up in 2016 

when GDP growth is expe
cted to be stronger. 
Unemployment, however, could be slow to 

decline, as labour supply is likely to keep 

increasing on account of i
mmigration. Real wages 
are likely to be boosted by slowing inflation in 

2015, whereas less generous wage settlements are 

expected in 2016. 
Core inflation stable despite cheaper energy Consumer price inflation plunged to 0.6% in the 

first quarter of 2015, reflecting a strong 

disinflationary impact from energy prices. The 

momentum in the remaining components, in 

particular services related to housing, hospitality 

and recreation, has remain
ed largely unaffected 
due to unabated demand in these sectors, keeping 

core inflation at 1.6%. Thes
e trends are expected to 
remain in place over 
the forecast horizon, 
especially as demand strengthens. Energy prices 

are expected to decline fu
rther in 2015 but regain 
some ground in 2016. All in all, headline inflation 

is projected at 0.8% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016. 
The likelihood of a considerable pick-up in economic activity seems slim, as Austria™s growth in 2014 
remained weak and business and consumer confid
ence have continued to s
lide. The low investment 
growth could also handicap the economy™s readiness 
to benefit from a recovery in international trade. 
Bank restructuring costs and income tax reform plans create uncertainties about the fiscal outlook. 
Member States, Austria 
  105 Positive fiscal outlook suffers from uncertainty 
ahead over bank restructuring and tax reform The general government deficit stood at 2.4% of 
GDP in 2014. This favour
able outcome compared 
to previous expectations is explained by positive 

revision of 2013 data and to lower expenditure in 

2014. This has allowed partly offsetting the 

additional costs arising from HETA, the asset 

management company into which Hypo Adria 

Bank has been converted to wind-down its 

impaired assets. The first results of the 

independent evaluation of the impaired assets point 

to lower economic value, leading to a larger deficit 

impact (1.4% of GDP) co
mpared to the previous 
estimate (1.2% of GDP)
. However, the final 
impact on the deficit remains however uncertain as 

it will depend on the finalisation of the 

independent asset evaluation as well as to the 

lawsuits related to the cancelation of part of 

HETA™s subordinated debt. 
The deficit is forecas
t to decline to 2.0
% of GDP 
in 2015. Persistent weak cyclical conditions are 

expected to negatively affect public finances in 

particular by lowering tax revenue. The 

government deficit is projected to remain 

unchanged at 2.0
% in 2016. This forecast is based 
on the Commission™s own estimation of the net 
effect of a tax reform aimed at reducing the tax 
burden on labour announced by the government on 

17 March this year. In this respect, the current 

forecast assumes, on the basis of the provisional 

tax reform plan, that the EUR 5.2 billion (1.5% of 

GDP) of tax relief and additional spending will be 

only partly financed by compensatory measures, 

and so will add to the deficit. In particular, the 

Commission™s forecast pruden
tially factors in only 
part (EUR 900 million) of the additional revenue 

expected from fighting tax fraud and does not 

explicitly include extra tax revenue expected from 

second-round effects of the reform linked to 

expansion in internal demand.  
The structural deficit improved by an estimated 
¾% of GDP in 2014 to around ½% of GDP, while 

it is expected to deteriorate by more than 
% of GDP in 2015 and by around another ½% of GDP 

in 2016. 
Government debt is project
ed to increase to 84.5% 
of GDP in 2014 and to 87.0% of GDP in 2015 and 

then decline to 85.8% of GDP in 2016. The 

increase in debt in 2014 is due to the inclusion into 

government's liabilities of HETA's assets worth 

about 4.3% GDP while in 2015 it reflects assets 

transferred from Kommunalkredit to KA Finanz 

worth about 2.0% of GDP.

  21. POLAND 
Sustained economic growth supported by strong domestic demand 
 106 Solid economic activity in 2014– Poland™s real GDP grew by 3.4% in 2014 despite 
external headwinds, such as the Russia-Ukraine 

conflict. Investment rose by 9.2%, mainly thanks 

to the corporate sector wh
ere firms increased their 
production capacity amid favourable financing 

conditions. Private consumption also contributed 

to economic growth. Consumer sentiment has been 

improving on the back of higher disposable 

incomes, as both employment and real wages 

increased. The saving rate of households narrowed 

while consumer credit expanded.  
–is projected to continue. Growth momentum is expected to remain robust 

over the forecast horizon, underpinned by solid 

domestic demand. Private consumption is set to 

strengthen further as real disposable incomes 

continue to rise on the back of favourable labour 

market developments and subdued inflation. The 

investment ratio is expected to continue increasing 

in light of low funding costs and various 

government measures supporting housing 

investment. However, the shift to the EU's 

Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 is 

expected to temporarily slow the absorption of the 

EU funds, thus curbing the growth of both private 

and public investment in 2016. The domestic-

demand driven increase in imports is expected to 

outweigh export growth, not least because the 

appreciation of the effective 
exchange rate is set to 
weigh on foreign demand for Polish goods and 

services. 
Poland™s labour market is
 forecast to benefit from 
the solid pace of economic activity and growing 

production capacity. The unemployment rate is set 

to decline from 9% in 2014 to 7.9% in 2016. A 

tighter labour market is e
xpected to translate into 
higher nominal wage growth. However, the 

structural unemployment rate is estimated to 

decline over the forecast 
horizon, which may limit 
wage increases. As productivity rebounds strongly, 

unit labour costs are for
ecast not to significantly 
deteriorate over the forecast horizon.

 The risks to the macroeconomic forecast are 
balanced. On the upside, some depreciation of the 

Polish z
oty against the currencies of main trading 
partners, e.g. in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine 

crisis, would boost exports and support import 

substitution. On the downside, a further 

appreciation of the Polish 
currency vis-à-vis main 
trading partners in the wake of the ECB™s 

expanded asset purchases programme could 

hamper exports growth. 
Vanishing inflation  Consumer prices were stable in 2014 and are 

expected to decrease in 2015 as a result of falling 

energy and food prices. Th
e decline of food prices 
is set to be driven by global trends, an 

exceptionally good harvest in 2014 and the impact 

of the Russian embargo on various agricultural 

products. In general, neither demand nor supply 

side developments justify dynamic price increases; 

output potential is still fo
recast to exceed demand 
while labour costs are 
projected to increase 
broadly in line with productivity growth. Overall, 

prices are expected to d
ecrease by 0.4% in 2015. 
Monthly inflation rates 
are expected to turn 
positive only at the end of 2015 and prices are 

forecast to rise by 1.1%
 in 2016 as a whole.  
Public finances are set to improve The general government deficit narrowed to 3.2% 
of GDP in 2014, from 4% in 2013. The 

improvement was to a large extent driven by the 
Economic activity is set to remain robust on the bac
k of solid domestic demand, bolstered by improving 
labour market conditions and strong investment activity. Public finances are projected to improve 

gradually. 
Member States, Poland 
  107 partial reversal of the 1999 systemic pension 
reform. The reversal limits the role of private 

pension funds. This change increased the 

proportion of social contributions retained by the 

general government and decreased interest 

expenditure due to a transfer
 of half of the assets 
which had been accumulated in the private pension 

funds. Moreover, indirect and direct tax revenues 

rebounded after a weak 2013. 
The general government deficit is projected to 
reach 2.8% of GDP in 2015. Social contributions 

are set to further increase on
 the back of the partial 
reversal of the 1999 pension reform. On the 

expenditure side, higher indexation of low-income 

pensions and the cost of restructuring of the 

mining sector will partially offset expenditure 

savings in other areas, such as the continued partial 

freeze of public wages. 
In 2016, the general government deficit is 
projected to improve to 2.6% of GDP on a  
no-policy-change assumpti
on. The expected fall in 
consumer prices in 2015 is
 forecast to curb social 
expenditure, some of which is indexed to inflation 

from the previous year. 
The restructuring of the 
mining sector poses a downside risk to our public 

finances forecast as its costs could turn out higher 

than currently estimated. 
The structural deficit is set to improve over the 
forecast horizon, from around 3½% of GDP in 

2013 to 2¼% in 2016. The general government 

debt-to-GDP ratio is set to fall from 55.7% in 2013 

to 50.1% in 2014 due to the transfer of assets 

accumulated in private pension funds. The debt 

ratio is expected to incr
ease to 50.9% in 2015 and 
to remain broadly stable in 2016. The projected 

debt figures are, however, subject to considerable 

uncertainty because of the potential impact of 

exchange rate fluctuations on the relatively high 

share of Poland™s sovereign debt denominated in 

foreign currencies.

  22. PORTUGAL 
The economic recovery consolidates further 
 108 Economic recovery accelerates– After three years of contraction, real GDP 
expanded by 0.9% in 2014, mainly driven by 

domestic demand, in particular private 

consumption. On the external side, imports 

increased more strongly than exports, causing a 

negative contribution from net exports for the first 

time since 2010.  
Most consumer confidence indicators, as well as 
data on car sales and on debit and credit cards 

purchases in the first quarter of 2015 point to a 

continuation of the strong domestic demand 

performance. Furthermore, low oil prices, an 

improved labour market, a gradual pick-up of 

wages and, albeit to a lesser extent, the burden-

reducing reform of the pe
rsonal income tax should 
lead to an increase of
 household disposable 
income, thereby supporting private consumption. 

The latter is projected to grow by 2.0% in 2015, 

and then gradually decelerat
e to 1.6% in 2016, as 
deleveraging pressures remain high. Although 

corporate indebtedness is still at an elevated range, 

the recent substantial 
increase in capacity 
utilisation, the accommodative monetary policy 

stance and the projected improvement in credit 

conditions should reinforce investment over the 

forecast horizon. In ad
dition, the improved 
business environment due to the recent reform of 

the corporate income tax is expected to stimulate 

private investment activity as well. Following the 

significant oil inventory accumulation in 2014, a 

gradual reversal in inventory dynamics is expected 

in 2015. 
–also driven by external demand. Having been weaker than expected in 2014, 

exports are forecast to accel
erate to 5-6% in 2015 
and 2016, due to positive growth prospects in 

major trading partners and the weakening of the 

euro. In turn, import growth is forecast to 

decelerate in 2015 due to
 destocking but is 
expected to gain some momentum in 2016, on the 

back of strong domestic demand. As a result, 

external demand is expected to contribute 

positively to GDP growth in 2015 and 2016. 
Overall, real GDP growth 
is projected to rise to 
1.6% in 2015 and to 1.8% in 2016.  
The main obstacles to stronger economic growth 
are deleveraging needs owing to high levels of 

public and private debt. However, there are upside 

risks related to the positive impact of the euro 

depreciation and the accommodative monetary 

policy stance.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)
forecast
 Labour market and inflation outlook improve In 2014, notwithstanding the subdued GDP 
growth, job creation was relatively strong on 

account, among other factors, of the strong 

implementation of active labour market policies 

and the labour market reforms undertaken in past 

years. As these effects are expected to level off 

over the forecast horizon, employment creation is 

expected to decelerate to
 0.6% in 2015 and to 
reach 0.7% in 2016. The unemployment rate is 

forecast to decline to 13.4
% in 2015 and to 12.6% 
in 2016. 
HICP inflation accelerated 
to 0.4% in March 2015, 
mainly on the back of one-off increases in 

transport services prices 
and the reinforcement of 
green taxes. However, low energy prices are 

expected to drag on HI
CP inflation during the 
coming months, while the depreciation of the euro 

and moderate wage increases are projected to 

generate upward pressures by the end of 2015. 
Economic growth is gathering momentum. Domestic demand is expected to be the main driver of growth 
while the negative contribution from net exports will vanish over the forecast horizon. The general 

government deficit is forecast to slightly decrea
se, due to the improved macroeconomic outlook.  
Member States, Portugal 
  109 Overall, HICP is forecast 
to grow by 0.2% in 2015 
and to accelerate to
 1.3% in 2016.  
Public finances benefitting from the modest 
economic recovery The general government deficit reached 4.5% of 
GDP in 2014, on the back of solid tax collection 

and effective expenditure control. There is 

however still a risk to the final headline deficit 

figure concerning the statistical recording of the 

financial sector support measure related to Banco 

Espírito Santo. 
In 2015, the headline defic
it is expected to decline 
further to 3.1% of GDP. The slight improvement 

relative to the winter forecast is the result of the 

revised macroeconomic outlo
ok. In particular, due 
to higher private consumption and employment, 

revenues from both indirect and direct taxes, as 

well as from social contributions, are forecast to 

slightly increase. This fo
recast takes into account  
the consolidation package included in the budget 

for 2015, estimating its impact at 0.5% of GDP, 

and other measures, such as the reforms of the 

personal income tax and green taxation. The 

projections also take on board some improvement 

in the efficiency of re
venue collection from the 
enhanced fight against tax fraud and evasion, while 
factoring in the uncertainty around the additional 

yields from these measures and the associated 

implementation risks. Under the no-policy-change 

assumption, the deficit is forecast to fall to 2.8% of 

GDP in 2016. Risks to the projections are broadly 

balanced: slightly positive concerning the 

macroeconomic outlook and potential additional 

savings in interest payments on the high public 

debt, but slightly negative related to the 

achievement of further efficiency gains in tax 

revenue collection, the implementation of the 

envisaged tax reforms in a budget-neutral fashion, 

and possible spending slippages in an election 

year.  The structural deficit is fo
recast to deteriorate by 
around ¾ pps. of GDP in 2015, as the reduction of 

the headline deficit is based on cyclical factors, 

rather than on additional structural measures. 
The gross public debt
-to-GDP ratio reached 
130.2% by end-2014, driven by higher cash 

reserves and the euro depreciation, and is expected 

to fall to 124.4% by end-2015 and 123.0% by end-

2016, supported by the projected economic 

recovery, the primary budget surplus and  

debt-reducing operations.

  23. ROMANIA 
Domestic demand fuels robust grow
th, fiscal consolidation reversed 
 110 Above-potential and accelerating growth  Romania's economy grew by 2.8% in 2014. The 
main engine was private consumption with 

marginal contributions 
from net exports and 
inventories. GDP growth 
is forecast to remain 
robust and above potential at 2.8% in 2015, mainly 

driven by private consumption and investment. 

Accelerating domestic demand, again boosted by 

cuts in indirect taxation, as well as a benign 

external environment, are 
expected to lift real GDP 
growth to 3.3% in 2016. 
Consumer sentiment is at a post-crisis high and 
expected wage increases accompanied by a lower 

VAT rate for food as of June 2015, a more 

favourable labour market outlook and low inflation 

are set to raise household real disposable income. 

After two years in negative territory, investment 

ended 2014 on a positive note (+1.4% y-o-y in the 

last quarter of 2014). Private investment is likely 

to continue growing over the forecast horizon 

supported by lower borrowing costs, a tax 

exemption on reinvested profits, robust economic 

growth prospects, and economic sentiment levels 

which are at a seven-year-h
igh. Public investment 
is expected to grow in 2015 with EU funds 

absorption picking up, before decreasing in 2016.

Graph II.23.1:
Romania -Real GDP growth and contributions
 The growth contribution of net exports faded out to 
almost zero in 2014 as import growth picked up. It 

is forecast to turn negativ
e in 2015 and remain so 
in 2016. Exports are expected to keep growing in 
2015 and 2016, but at a slower pace, while 

increasing domestic demand stimulates even 

stronger imports. The current-account deficit 

improved to 0.5% of GDP in 2014. It is forecast to 

increase in 2015-2016, reflecting the deterioration 

in the trade balance driven by higher imports. 
Record low inflation Inflation declined significantly in 2014 with HICP 

falling to an average of 1.4%, mostly due to the 

VAT cut for bread, falling global oil prices and a 

good harvest in 2014. Annual average inflation is 

forecast to decelerate further to a record low of 

0.2% in 2015 owing to the VAT reduction for 

food, low energy prices an
d the persistence of low 
inflation in the EU. Surging domestic demand is 

expected to exert upside pressure on inflation in 

2016, but the 4 pps. acros
s-the-board cut in VAT 
will work in the opposite direction, resulting in an 

annual average inflation of 0.9%.  
Labour market with signs of improvement Employment in Romania grew by 1% in 2014, this 

being the first yearly incr
ease since the outbreak of 
the crisis. It is projected to continue growing in 

2015 and 2016. The unemployment rate dropped to 

6.8% in 2014 and is expect
ed to decrease further to 
6.4% by the end of the forecast period. Pushed by 

wage increases, compensation per head is expected 

to grow steadily in 2015 and 2016, despite the cut 

in social security contri
butions enacted in October 
2014; against the background of low inflation, this 

will result in higher real wages. As productivity 

growth picks up again in 2016, unit labour costs 

increase but only moderately over the forecast 

horizon. 
Balanced risks to the growth outlook Downside risks stem mainly from households 

constraining consumption more than expected to 

reduce their indebtedness and from a possible 

escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Upside 

risks are related to a better-than-expected 

implementation of the EU investment plan.  
Economic growth in Romania is forecast to remain robust in 2015 and 2016, driven by strong private 
consumption and recovering investment. Inflation is
 expected to fall significantly in 2015 and remain 
low over the forecast horizon. The fiscal consolidation path is projected to be reversed in 2016.  
Member States, Romania 
  111 Tax cuts to question fiscal consolidation The 2014 deficit came out at 1.5% of GDP. 
Revenue was higher than in 2013, as a hike in fuel 

excise rates and the introduction of a special 

constructions tax outweighed the 5 pps. cut in 

social security contributions introduced in late 

2014. Expenditure grew slower than GDP among a 

dent in public investment. 
The government budget defi
cit is forecast to widen 
slightly to 1.6% of GDP in 2015, as a reduction in 

the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio more than offsets the 

reduction in the expenditure ratio. The revenue 

projection includes the full-year impact of the cut 

in social security contributions, the reduction in the 

special construction tax rate and the reduction of 

VAT rates for foodstuff and related services to be 

implemented starting June 2015. Savings occur as 

expenditure on goods and services and subsidies 

are expected to fall as a 
share of GDP. The public 
wage bill remains contained because of a partial 

wage freeze. This forecast assumes full use of the 

budget allocation for national EU funds  

co-financing, but under-execution of domestically 

financed capital expenditure given the low record 

in the first quarter. 
For 2016, the headline de
ficit is expected to 
sharply deteriorate to 3.5%
 of GDP. This forecast 
incorporates the new draf
t fiscal code that was 
adopted by the government on 25 March but is 

awaiting parliamentary approval. The fiscal code 

includes an array of tax cuts, such as a reduction in 

VAT rates by 4 pps. in 2016, reduced excise rates, 

the abolition of dividend taxation and removal of 

the special constructions tax. The expiration of the 

current natural resource taxation regime and a 

further diversion of social security contributions 

towards the second pension pillar are taken into 

consideration. The expenditure side includes a 

reduction in capital expenditure, linked to the 

transition between programming periods for EU 

structural funds. Risks to the budget outlook are on 

the upside as the size of the envisaged tax cuts 

might be reduced. An amendment to alleviate cuts 

in excise rates and dividend taxation, as reportedly 

proposed by the senate budget committee, would 

bring the deficit close to 3% of GDP.  
In structural terms, the de
ficit is forecast to remain 
stable at around 1¼% of
 GDP in 2014-15 and to 
worsen to 3½% of GDP in 2016. Government debt 

is set to increase from 39.8% of GDP in 2014 to 

42.4% of GDP by 2016.

  24. SLOVENIA 
Strong growth set to decelerate but become more broad-based 
 112 Strong growth in 2014 in line with expectations The Slovenian economy grew by 2.6% in 2014, 
significantly up from the -1.0% contraction in 

2013. The turnaround was mainly driven by net 

exports, followed by investments in infrastructure 

projects co-funded by the EU. Real exports grew 

by a remarkable 6.3%, leading to a significant gain 

in Slovenian market shares. Investment overall 

grew by 4.8%, driven by an increase in public 

investment of 21.2%. However, machinery and 

equipment investment contracted, after the strong 

rebound recorded in 2013. Slowly rising 

employment supported a modest recovery in 

private consumption, which turned positive after 

three consecutive years of decline. 
Broad-based yet slightly decelerating growth Exports and public investment are forecast to 

remain the dominant drivers of growth in 2015, 

although both are expected to be somewhat weaker 

than in 2014, leading to a slightly lower real GDP 

growth of 2.3% in 2015. Despite still dynamic 

exports, the contribution of net exports is expected 

to decrease further in 2016 due to rising imports 

triggered by higher domestic demand, leading to 

2.1% real GDP growth in 2016.  
Private investment, as i
ndicated by exceptionally 
high capacity utilisation levels at the start of 2015, 

is projected to continuously rise over the forecast 

horizon. It is expected to flow into new machinery 

and equipment in the tradable sectors, driven by 

increasing external dema
nd. Private consumption 
is also expected to stre
ngthen, while government 
consumption (under a no-policy change 

assumption) is expected 
to increase strongly in 
2016, ending a five-year decline. In contrast, 

public investment is set to contract considerably in 

2016 (when the new EU fund programmes begin). 
Supported by strong exports, the current account 
surplus is projected to rise
 steadily and is expected 
to remain high as long as deleveraging in the 

corporate sector continues. This deleveraging 

process is expected to last over the forecast 
horizon (albeit at a slow
er pace), consequently 
hampering the full recovery of private investment. 
The risks to the forecas
t are broadly balanced. 
Improving business confidence and investment 

projects supported by the investment plan for 

Europe may result in high
er-than-forecast growth 
rates for private investment. By contrast, slower 

absorption of funds under the new EU fund 

programmes may result in
 a greater decline in 
public investment in 2016 than currently 

anticipated. -12-10-8

 Positive labour market trends and stagnant 
prices Employment grew by 0.7% and unemployment fell 
to 9.7% in 2014. Both indicators are expected to 

improve further consistent with forecast economic 

growth. In 2015, wage growth in the private sector 

is expected to remain modest and public sector 

wages are set to remain contained. In 2016, more 

pressure on wage growth is assumed, especially in 

the public sector and sectors covered by collective 

wage bargaining.  
Inflation is at historically
 low levels and is forecast 
to remain subdued over th
e forecast horizon. While 
core inflation is projected to remain positive (1.0% 

and 1.6% in 2015 and 2016 respectively), almost 

flat HICP rate is foreseen in 2015, mainly due to 
Following a strong 2.6% outturn in 2014, Slovenian economic growth is expected to moderate this year 
to 2.3% before further decelera

Fiscal deficit expected to decline  In 2014, the general government deficit was 4.9% 

of GDP (down from 14.9
% of GDP in 2013). The 
deficit was lower in 2014 than previously 

anticipated mainly due to a lower impact from the 

scheme to repay deposit holders of Ljubljanska 

Banka approved by the Government in December 

2014. The timing of the payment of the interest 

relating to these deposits is unclear and represents 

a negative risk to the general government deficit 

over the forecast horizon. 
For 2015, the general government deficit is 
forecast to stand at 2.9%
 of GDP. The expected 
reduction in the deficit is driven by the expiration 

of one-off exceptional items (1.1% of GDP in 

2014) and savings mainly on the expenditure side, 

through a reform and reduction in the allocation of 

subsidies and the prolongation of measures to 

reduce the public sector wage bill.  
In 2016, under a no-policy-change assumption, the 
general government deficit is expected to decline  
further to 2.8% of GDP. A significant increase in 
consumption expenditure is expected to be more 

than offset by a large reduction in gross fixed 

capital formation due to the end of the drawdown 

period from the 2007-2013 EU fund programmes, 

investment projects under the new 2014-2020 

programme have yet to be commenced.  
In structural terms, Slovenia's fiscal position 
deteriorated by approximately 0.3 pps. in 2014 and 

is expected to improve marginally by 0.1 pp. in 

2015. In 2016, the structural balance is  

expected to deteriorate by some 0.5 pps. under the  

no-policy-change assumption. 
General government debt grew by over 10 pps. to 
almost 81% of GDP in 2014 as the authorities took 

advantage of historically low interest rates and 

undertook considerable pre-financing. Public debt 

levels are expected to gradually grow throughout 

the forecast horizon due 
to continuing budget 
deficits. Proceeds from the ongoing privatisation 

process and a reduction in the accumulated cash 

buffer represent a positive risk to debt levels, 

which is not factored into the forecast.

  25. SLOVAKIA 
Recovery strengthens fuelled by steady domestic demand 
 114 Growth strengthens– After slowing down in 2013, growth picked up in 
2014 on the back of a strong recovery in private 

consumption and investment. Domestic demand is 

expected to continue strengthening and to remain 

the main motor of growth. Real GDP increased by 

2.4% in 2014 and is projected to expand by 3.0% 

in 2015 and 3.4% in 2016. Labour market 

conditions improved in 2014 and are expected to 

further ameliorate in line with the pickup in 

economic activity. HICP inflation was slightly 

negative in 2014 and is forecast to increase only 

slowly. -10

Graph II.25.1:
Slovakia -Real GDP growth and contributions
 –as domestic demand recovers. After three consecutive y
ears of decline, private 
consumption rebounded in 2014 to expand by 

2.2% in real terms, driven by growing real 

disposable income, higher employment and 

improving consumer confidence. These factors are 

expected to continue to sustain private 

consumption growth, which could also be 

bolstered by a series of labour market reforms that 

have taken effect in 2015, including a rise in the 

minimum wage and a reduction in the social 

contributions paid by low-income workers. Private 

consumption is therefore expected to grow by 

2.4% in 2015 and 2.7% in 2016. 
Investment rebounded strongly after two years of 
decline and grew by 5.7% in real terms. Equipment 

investment and non-residential construction were 

the main drivers of investment growth, while 

housing construction contracted. Planned 

expansions in the automotive and 

telecommunications industries and ongoing 

motorway construction are expected to further 

support investment, which is projected to increase 

by 4.6% in 2015 and by 3.7% in 2016. 
No boost from the external sector Export growth slowed down in 2014, reflecting 

weak demand from Slovakia's main trading 

partners, and is only expected to recover in 2016. 

Imports increased faster than exports in 2014, 

reflecting the pick-up in investment and private 

consumption, and net exports acted as a drag on 

growth. Going forward, imports are forecast to 

evolve more in line with exports and Slovakia is 

projected to continue 
running a current-account 
surplus. 
Labour market conditions improve Growth in employment was strong throughout 

2014 and labour market c
onditions are expected to 
further improve, in line with the upturn in 

economic activity. The unemployment rate fell 

from 14.2% in 2013 to 13.2% in 2014 and is 

expected to continue dec
lining. The labour market 
reforms that came into force in 2015, including a 

reduction in the healthcare contributions of low-

income workers and an expansion of in-work 

benefits, should further support the labour market's 

recovery.  Inflation slowly resurfaces Inflation declined sharply in 2014 and was slightly 

negative for the year as a whole. The fall in 

inflation was caused mainly by declining energy 

and unprocessed food prices. Core inflation, 

however, remained well above zero. Inflation is 

expected to slowly increase as energy prices 
Growth picked up in 2014 and is for
ecast to further strengthen on th
e back of a recovery in domestic 
demand. Labour market conditions are expected to continue improving, in line with the upturn in 

economic activity. Inflation was slightly negative in 2014 and is projected to recover only slowly. 

Slovakia's fiscal situation is expected to improve gr
adually, also thanks to its increasingly tax-rich 
growth structure. 
Member States, Slovakia 
  115 recover and the rebound in domestic demand puts 
upward pressure on the price of services. 
Gradual budgetary consolidation continues In 2014, the general government deficit 

deteriorated to 2.9% of GDP from 2.6% of GDP a 

year earlier. Stronger-than-budgeted tax revenues, 

expenditure freezes triggere
d by the first stage of 
the public debt brake and lower co-financing of 

EU-related projects were not sufficient to 

counterbalance the ne
gative impact stemming 
primarily from dividend shortfalls, lower capital 

revenues and higher spending on public healthcare. 
In 2015, the deficit is proj
ected to decline to 2.7% 
of GDP. Strengthening private consumption and 

further compliance improvements are expected to 

lead to higher VAT collection. Higher corporate 

income tax revenue will be driven by rising 

profitability of companies and the broadening of 

the tax base. Support for R&D investment and the 

introduction of a healthcare contribution allowance 

for low-paid workers will,
 however, dampen the 
rise in tax revenues. On the expenditure side, the 

forecast pencils in the planned increase in 

spending on active labour market policies and  
education. The government has also announced the 
'second social package', of which only the 

introduction of a minimum pension has been 

approved and quantified and is thus reflected in the 

forecast. Moreover, the forecast assumes and 

recent data corroborates 
a larger-than-budgeted 
drawing of EU funds and ensuing higher national 

co-financing of these expe
nditures, as 2015 is the 
last year to use available resources from the  

2007-13 programming period. Tightening budget 

lines and expenditure freezes in the previous year 

have led to the build-up of some tension in public 

finances that may prove difficult to contain, 

especially in view of some additional pressure for 

social spending. Under an assumption of 

unchanged policies, the deficit is projected to 

decline to 2.5% of GDP in 2016, driven by 

improving macroeconomic environment. 
The structural balance dete
riorated by about ½ pp. 
in 2014 to -2% of GDP. The structural position is 

projected to slightly improve in the following 

years with the structural
 deficit reaching 1¾% of 
GDP in 2016. Public debt is expected to decline to 

53.4% of GDP in 2015 and remain broadly at that 

level in 2016.

  26. FINLAND 
Recovery fails to accelerate despite improving external 
environment 
 116 Recession coming to an end– Preliminary data show 
that Finland's economy 
narrowly failed to escape its protracted downturn 

in 2014, as GDP contract
ed by 0.1%. Last year 
was thus the third year of decreasing economic 

activity. In 2014, all demand components Œ final 

consumption, investment and export Œ continued to 

contract. The biggest driver of the fall in demand 

was private investment, which contracted by 6.5%. 

Domestic demand decreased by 0.8% but net 

export increased as the fall in import was larger 

than the fall in export. Reflecting the prolonged 

recession, the number of
 workers decreased and 
core inflation decelerated
. On the production side, 
the volume of gross value added remained 

unchanged from 2013; it decreased in 

manufacturing and in construction while the value 

added in service industries increased. 
–but only gradual recovery is in sight. As the economy unexpectedly lost momentum at 

the end of the last year, the starting point for this 

year is weak. Momentum 
is unlikely to pick up 
until later in the year and altogether, real GDP is 

forecast to grow by 0.3% in
 2015 and then 1.0% in 
2016. In 2015, real value added is forecast to 

increase in manufacturing on
 the back of sturdier 
order books. Services production continues to 

increase while the outlook for construction remains 

weak. Foreign trade to increase this year Over the past few years, Finland has been losing 

export market shares du
e to competitiveness 
losses, especially in its electronics industry. 

Although the euro has de
preciated, demand from 
the main trading partners is expected to increase 

and cost-competitiveness is assumed to improve 

gradually, the growth of exports is projected to 

remain rather moderate over the forecast period. 

Also the volume of good
s imported is forecast to 
remain subdued due to sluggish domestic demand.

Graph II.26.1:
Finland -Real GDP growth and contributions
 Thanks to lower oil and import prices, the balance 
of goods and services is expected to swing from 

deficit of 0.4% of GDP in 2014 to surplus of 0.5% 

of GDP this year. Still, Fi
nland™s current account is 
expected to remain in deficit but is forecast to 

improve from -1.8% of GDP in 2014 to -0.7% in 

2015. In 2016, the current account is expected to 

improve only marginally as favourable effects 

from lower oil price and the weaker euro diminish. 
Although export is pr
ojected to increase, 
equipment investment is 
not expected to increase 
in 2015 because there is
 spare capacity in the 
manufacturing sector and the abundance of office 

space limits the need 
for new non-residential 
investment. As economic activity gradually 

increases in 2015 and 2016, investment should 

return to growth in 2016. 
Private consumption turns to growth The consumer confidence indicator reached its 

highest level since mid-2011 in February, 

approaching its long-term 
average. This suggests 
that households are becoming more optimistic 

about the economic outlook.  
Developments in the labour market are mixed. 
While the number of people employed has recently 

fallen, so has the number of working age people 
Finland™s three-year do
wnturn is expected to come
 to an end this year with the economy forecast to 
start growing again gradually. Consumption and exports are expected to increase, helped by the euro™s 

depreciation and lower oil prices, but investment still looks sluggish. The budget deficit is forecast to 

remain above 3% of GDP in 2015-16 and public de
bt is expected to exceed 60% of GDP in 2015.  
Member States, Finland 
  117 outside the labour force, as more people have 
started to look for a job. This resulted in higher 

unemployment. The average unemployment rate is 

expected to increase to 9.
1% in 2015 and then fall 
moderately in 2016. Employment is expected to 

increase marginally this 
year and somewhat more 
in 2016. Gradually increasing employment, near 

zero inflation, small but positive wage increases 

and income tax reductions are supporting the 

growth of households' real disposable incomes this 

year. Private consumption is expected to grow by 

0.4% in 2015 and by 0.6% in 2016.  
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. On the 
one hand, external demand could deteriorate if 

demand from Russia surprised negatively. In 2016, 

fiscal policy could be tighter than is currently 

expected under the no-po
licy change assumption. 
On the other hand, the euro area could benefit from 

ECB's recent measures or lower oil prices more 

than expected. Finally, private consumption could 

get a temporary boost as the largest banks in 

Finland began offering borrowers a one-year 

mortgage repayment holiday early this year. 
Unexpectedly high deficit in 2014 At 3.2% of GDP the general government deficit 

outcome for 2014 was, according to preliminary 
figures, 0.5 pps. higher than expected in previous 
forecasts. The surprise outcome is explained by 

lower-than-expected indirect tax revenue and 

lower sales and other current revenue, but is also 

due to higher-than-expected intermediate 

consumption and other expenditure. 
In 2015, the wage-income tax brackets have been 
adjusted for wage inflation after a temporary 

freeze, but only for th
e three lower income 
categories. On the other hand, the progressivity of 

income taxation was increased, some tax subsidies 

were eliminated, and excise duties and real-estate 

taxes increased. Despite the measures, the deficit is 

expected to increase to 
3.3% of GDP. In 2016, 
assuming no changes in policy, the deficit is 

projected to decline to 3.2%
 of GDP on the back of 
increasing economic activity. 
The structural balance is expected to remain at 
about -1¾% of GDP in 2015 and to worsen by 

about ½ pp. of GDP in 2016. Gross government 

debt is set to reach 62
.6% of GDP in 2015 and 
64.8% in 2016. Debt is increasing due to the high 

primary deficit, but also b
ecause the social security 
sector surplus is not used to reduce the debt.

Strong investment and brig
htening outlook for exports 
 118 Investments rebounded in 2014 Sweden™s real GDP increased by 2.1% in 2014, its 
highest rate since 2011. Consumption remained an 

important engine of growth, but in addition, the 

sharp rebound in investment came as a positive 

surprise. Domestic demand will remain strong over 

the forecast horizon but the economy is also set to 

benefit from higher exports, thanks to stronger 

economic growth in the 
euro area and a weaker 
krona. By contrast, the plunge in oil and energy 

prices is likely to have only a limited positive 

impact on the Swedish economy because of the 

country™s relatively low energy intensity and high 

energy taxes.

 Consumption remains a stable growth engine Supported by low interest rates, strong 
employment growth, steadily growing disposable 

incomes, record high savings rate of households 

and rising housing prices, private consumption is 

forecast to remain robust. Government 

consumption is projected to continue growing at a 

high pace in the coming y
ears because of increased 
spending related to immigration, education and 

elderly care. 
Investment expected to moderate Following a contraction of 0.4% in 2013, 

investments expanded at a rate of 6.5% in 2014, 

the highest rate since 
2007. The acceleration was 
driven by housing investment and construction, 

which rose last year by 20.3% and 7.6%, 

respectively. In addition, a large one-off R&D 

investment in the fourth quarter of 2014 

temporarily boosted investment growth. By 

contrast, machinery and equipment investment 

contracted by 1.7% in 2014. Construction 

investment is projected to slow down in the 

coming years, while machinery investment is 

forecast to increase only moderately, due to still 

fragile developments in the EU. As the impact of 

the temporary boost also disappears, investment 

growth is projected to rise
 at a slower pace of 4.1% 
in 2015 and 4.5% in 2016. 
More positive outlook for exports Since almost 70% of Sw
eden™s exports go to 
Europe, stronger economic performance in the EU 

and a weaker exchange ra
te will benefit Swedish 
exporters. Exports are for
ecast to increase by 4.1% 
in 2015 and 5.3% in 2016. On the back of strong 

household consumption growth, imports are 

projected to grow even faster throughout the 

forecast horizon. Nevertheless, net trade should 

start to contribute positively to economic growth in 

2016. 
Slow decline of unemployment Labour supply continue
s to increase swiftly, 
mainly due to an exceptionally high number of 

immigrants and asylum seekers settling in Sweden. 

Despite fairly strong employment growth deriving 

mainly from services and the public sector, 

unemployment has been stuck at around 8% for 

several years. A widening skills and geographical 

mismatch on the labour market will slow the  
Sweden™s real GDP growth is forecast to rise in the coming years thanks to robust domestic demand 
and an improved outlook for exports. The Swedish cen
tral bank™s monetary easing is expected to kindle 
a gradual rise in inflation. After its peak in 2014, the general government deficit should gradually 

narrow as the economy strengthens and the fiscal policy stance is kept broadly neutral. 
Member States, Sweden 
  119 decline in unemployment 
over the coming years 
and could potentially increase the natural rate of 

unemployment. Unemployment is forecast to fall 

gradually to 7.7% in 2015 and then to 7.6% in 

2016. 
Expansionary monetary policy In February 2015, the Swedish central bank 

implemented further monetary easing by bringing 

repo rates into negative territory and started its 

asset purchase programme to fight deflationary 

pressures exacerbated by falling oil prices. The 

central bank expects its expansive monetary policy 

to help lifting inflation towards its 2% target. 

Nevertheless, HICP inflation is projected at 0.7% 

in 2015, although
 it should reach 1.6% in 2016 
when the impact of lower energy prices wanes. 
Important risks to consider On the positive side, the Riksbank™s expansionary 

monetary policy could result in a stronger 

depreciation of the currency, which would boost 

exports. Low oil prices could provide a stronger 

lift to the economy than projected. On the negative 

side, increased geopolitical uncertainties, including 

a possible further escalation of the Russian crisis  
pose a negative risk, because it could negatively 
impact growth in Sweden's several main trading  

partners and undermine business confidence. 

Exports could remain weaker if investment 

remains subdued in Sweden™s main trading 

partners, as investment goods represent a large 

proportion of Swedish exports. A correction in 

house prices, which rose to new historical highs set 

in 2014, could dampen household consumption 

and construction investment. 
Gradually improving public finances The general government deficit is forecast to 

gradually improve from 1.9% of GDP in 2014 to 

1.5% of GDP in 2015 and under a no-policy-

change assumption to 1.0% of GDP in 2016, while 

the output gap gradually closes. The structural 

deficit will stay around 1.0% of GDP in 2015 and 

2016. The main negative risks to the budget could 

come from higher costs asso
ciated with migration, 
integration and sickness benefit. General 

government debt rose to 43.9% of GDP in 2014, 

due to the increasing budget deficit and the 

weakening of the SEK, but is expected to remain 

broadly unchanged in 2015 and 2016.

Domestic demand continues to support strong growth 
 120 Buoyant growth in 2014 GDP grew by 2.8% in 2014, notably more than its 
1.7% increase in 2013. Domestic demand was the 

main factor, contributing 3.2 pps. whereas net 

exports detracted 0.5 pps. and have not contributed 

to growth since 2011. While the composition of 

growth broadened significantly in 2014 to include 

business investment, which more than doubled 

compared to 2013, the widening of growth is yet to 

extend to the external sector.

 Outlook remains strong In the near term, growth is expected to continue at 
a similar rate to that in late 2014. Although rises in 

industrial production ha
ve slowed in recent 
months, signals from the services sector remain 

positive. Forward expectations of business activity 

in the major business surveys indicate that 

momentum will continue in the first half of 2015. 
Healthy private consumption growth continues Private consumption growth is projected at 2.6% in 

both 2015 and 2016. Further rises in real 

household disposable income should underpin 

private consumption, which is supported by higher 

incomes rather than reductions in saving, as the 

household saving ratio is expected to remain 

around 6% in 2015 and 2016. An upside risk is 
that the fall in retail fuel and energy prices could 
boost consumption by more than projected. 

However, a downside risk may be unexpectedly 

low wage growth. 
Business investment growth cooling slightly Investment growth is exp
ected to gently abate in 
2015 and 2016 to around 5.5%. Nevertheless, it is 

projected to remain well above GDP growth, as 

business investment is sustained by solid 

fundamentals including strong corporate balance 

sheets, healthy profits, 
low borrowing costs, 
buoyant demand and an increasingly resilient 

financial sector. However, a downside risk is that 

credit growth to businesses contracts further and 

that certain businesses, 
for instance, small and 
medium-sized enterprises, continue to report 

difficulties in access to finance and therefore 

postpone investment decisions. 
External sector drags growth down The weakness in exports and imports is expected 

to unwind in 2015 and 2016 however net exports 

are not projected to contri
bute to growth. Imports 
are expected to increase as domestic demand 

continues to expand and the appreciation of 

sterling dampens the relative price of imports. 

Exports are also projected 
to strengthen modestly 
as demand from major trading partners offsets the 

impact of the appreciation of sterling. 
Unemployment to fall further and wages to rise The labour market remain
s robust as employment 
continues to rise solidly and the unemployment 

rate, which is forecast to drop to 5.4% and 5.3% in 

2015 and 2016 respectively, continues to decline. 

The tightening in the labour market is expected to 

lead to a modest rise in employee compensation, 

which should further underpin growth in private 

consumption. However, a risk is that productivity 

stays at current low levels, which would depress 

wage growth. 
Economic growth maintains its healthy pace supported by a fall in oil prices, rising employment, low 
borrowing costs and household disposable income growth. GDP growth is expected to be driven by 

domestic demand in 2015 and 2016 with net exports li
kely to detract from growth. Inflation is forecast 
to fall again in 2015 but should rise somewhat in 2016. The budget deficit continues to fall and debt 

nears its peak. 
Member States, The United Kingdom 
  121 Inflation to fall further in 2015 Inflation has been weaker
 than projected in the 
winter forecast and is now expected at 0.4% in 

2015 before rising modestly to 1.6% in 2016. The 

fall in retail energy prices, the appreciation of 

sterling and compression of retailers' margins in 

the supermarket sector have contributed to 

continued low inflation in 2014. However, should 

core inflation and inflation expectations fall 

further, there is a risk that inflation becomes 

entrenched at historically low rates. 
Public finances continue to improve The 2015 budget, delivered in March, continued 

the ongoing fiscal consolidation plan. Some small 

additional fiscal tightenin
g amounting to 0.05% of 
GDP was announced for the financial years  

2015-16 and 2017-18, with a small loosening of 

0.08% of GDP in 2018-19 and 2019-20. New 

taxation measures include cuts to alcohol duty and 

a continuation of the freeze on fuel duty, an 

increase in the personal 
income tax allowance and 
tax cuts for the North 
Sea oil sector. These 
measures were offset by an increase in the bank 

levy from 0.156% to 0.21% and further measures 

to reduce tax evasion and avoidance. 
On the spending side, a new ‚Help to Buy™ 
Individual Savings Account (ISA) was announced. 

The aim of the scheme is 
to encourage first-time 
buyers to save for a deposit for a home. The 

scheme will give a government bonus of 25% on 

top of the amount saved up to a maximum 

contribution of GBP 3'000, with minimal effect on 

the deficit. The main sources of the decline in the 

budget balance in 2016-17 are previously 

announced measures cutting departmental 

spending and increases in social contributions.  
The government deficit is forecast to fall to 4.1% 
of GDP in 2015-16 and further to 2.7% of GDP in 

2016-17 on a no-policy change basis given the 

current macroeconomic ou
tlook. This implies an 
average improvement in th
e structural balance of 
around ¾ pps. of GDP per year over the 2-year 

period. The debt ratio is estimated to continue 

rising, though marginally, to 89.3% of GDP in 

2016-17.

   Candidate Countries   29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV
 REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Firming domestic demand spurs further acceleration of growth 
 124 Exports and investment drive growth in 2014 Large-scale public infras
tructure projects and a 
surge in exports, mainly driven by foreign 

companies established in 
the country, carried the 
marked acceleration of real
 GDP growth in 2014. 
Given the high import content of investment and 

exports, the external balance made a negative 

contribution to growth, after having been its main 

support in 2013. Strong in
creases in overall gross 
fixed capital formation in the first three quarters of 

2014 were followed by slack towards the end of 

the year, yet, on average, investment activity 

recovered markedly after its sharp drop in the 

preceding year. As of the second quarter, 

household spending, supported by rising real net 

wages, stable private transfer inflows and 

improved access to credit,
 turned into a solid 
second pillar of domestic demand growth. The 

merchandise trade balance improved in 2014, in 

terms of GDP, compared to the previous year. 

This, in combination with an increased surplus in 

the services balance, and 
stable private transfer 
inflows, accounted for a 
narrowing in the current 
account deficit, by 0.5 pp
s. to 1.3% of GDP. Job 
creation in the manufacturing sector, bolstered by 

active labour market measures, was the main 

driver of further, though decelerated employment 

growth, and a further decline in the unemployment 

rate. Labour market participation remained low, at 

57% overall, and particularly so for women. There 

was no improvement in the situation of young 

workers, with almost half of the workforce 

between 15 and 24 years old registered as 

unemployed. 
Spending pressures weigh on budget Fiscal performance disappointed further in the 

second half of 2014. While tax revenues 

recovered, increased entitlement spending, as well 

as unexpected additional expenditure for Transport 

Corridor X road construction, led to pressures even 

after a supplementary budget was adopted in 
September. In addition to increases in entitlement 
spending that entered into force earlier in the year, 

the government supported private demand by a 

further rise in public wages in the autumn. At the 

end of the year, the general government deficit 

amounted to 4.2% of GDP, exceeding the revised 

target by 0.5 pps. The increase in government debt 

remained contained in 2014, but borrowing by 

state-owned enterprises drove up public debt levels 

as well as contingent liabilities of the government, 

which provides guarant
ees for their loans.

 Drag from external balance likely to diminish Domestic demand is expected to remain the sole 
growth driver over the forecast horizon. 

Investment activity, driven by public expenditure 

on transport and energy projects, as well as the 

construction of new foreign investment facilities, 

is projected to post further solid gains, even though 

growth rates are slowing down to their long-term 

average. Household spending, benefitting from 

sound fundamentals, is likely to firm up further, 

and set to become the main source of output

Export performance is pr

Output growth accelerated in 2014,
 driven by exports of foreign in
vestors and public infrastructure 
investment. Solid gains in household spending further bolstered domestic demand. Given high 

investment- and trade-rela
ted import demand, the foreign balance weighed down on economic activity. 
Further gains in domestic demand are likely to set GDP growth at an even higher pace in 2015 and 

2016, while the negative contribution from net exports is expected to diminish. The government remains 

supportive, with plans for further infrastructure
 projects, and increases in entitlement spending, 
relaxing its mid-term fiscal consolidation strategy.

investment-related imports relenting somewhat,

government's deficit target of 3.3% by some 

0.5 pps. The recent and envisaged increases in 

entitlement spending are already leaving their 

mark on budget performance - in the first two 

months of 2015, the accumulated budget deficit 

amounted to some 25% of the full-year budget 

target, or 0.8% of projected GDP. A number of 

revenue-enhancing measures have been planned 

for 2015, but these may not compensate for the 

planned rise in current sp
ending, including a recent 
decision by the government to raise social transfers 

as of July by 5% more th
an foreseen in the budget. 
Hence, the need for a 
supplementary budget, 
providing for cuts in budgeted growth-enhancing 

capital expenditure is not unlikely.

Tourism, investment and low inflation support growth 
 126 Strong domestic demand drove growth in 2014 After mainly externally driven output growth of 
3.6% in 2013, domestic demand was the main 

driving factor in 2014, resulting in GDP growth of 

1.9%. Spill-overs from the tourism boom in the 

previous year played an important role, for 

example, via boosting tourism related construction 

activity. However, the largest growth contribution 

came from private consumption, which benefitted 

from low inflation, the start of a government's 

household debt relief scheme but also increased 

employment and income, in particular in tourism 

related sectors.  
The labour market situation continued to improve, 
with employment increasing by 1.6% in 2014. 

However, job creation took mainly place in low-

skilled and low-wage sectors, partly reflecting the 

expansion of tourism. The decline in 

unemployment continued in the first two months 

of 2015, with a decline in the seasonally-adjusted 

unemployment rate to 4.5% on average in January-

February, compared to 5.5% on average a year 

before.  
Inflation dropped markedly
 in 2014, reaching 2% 
on annual average, compared to 3.9% in 2013. 

Towards the end of 2014 and in early 2015 

inflation remained low, registering an overall  

12-months increase by 1.1% in the first three 

months of 2015, compared to 2.5% the year 

before. The main reasons 
for this deceleration are 
lower oil prices, a strong currency and moderate 

wage agreements. As a result, real wages increases 

were significant. Together with strong employment 

growth, low inflation contributed to a marked 

increase in real disposable income.  
After a general government deficit of 1.7% of 
GDP in 2013, preliminary public sector accounts 

registered a deficit of some 0.2% of GDP in 2014. 

The main underlying factors were a one-off 

dividend payment of a largely state-owned bank, 

but also strong growth of direct taxes.  
In 2015-16, tourism, investment and real 
disposable income are expected to support 

growth  Key factors for output growth in 2015-16 are 
expected to be tourism and private consumption, 

benefitting from lower inflation and government 

measures to boost disposable income, such as the 

household debt relief programme. Investment is 

likely to be strong reflecting tourism-related 

construction, capital renewal in the fishing 

industry and silicon related investment projects 

reaching the implementati
on phase. Total exports 
are projected to benefit from a flourishing tourism 

sector. However, the positive effects of higher 

tourism revenues are likely to be partly offset by 

higher imports due to stronger domestic and 

tourism related demand.

forecast
 Thanks to solid growth and new employment 
opportunities in tourism and construction, labour 

market conditions are likely to continue 

improving. Annual average unemployment thus 

could drop to close to 4% by 2016. However, most 

new jobs are likely to be in lower wage segments.  
Inflation is likely to accelerate in the near 
future  Inflation is likely to remain close to the Central 
Bank target of 2.5% in 2015, reflecting reduced 
Domestic demand was the main driver of growth in 2014, benefitting from spill-overs from the tourism 
boom in 2013 but also from a strong increase in real disposable income. These supporting factors are 

likely to continue bolstering growth in the coming years. The overall favourable economic environment 

and reforms to Iceland's tax system will support 
public finances and a con
tinued debt reduction.  
Candidate Countries, Iceland 
  127 inflation expectations, but also benefitting from 
government plans to reduce tax rates on VAT and 

to abolish commodity taxes. However, in 2016, 

temporary factors, such as
 the currently low import 
prices, are expected to fade out, which could push 

inflation again above the 
Central Bank target.  
As a result of stronger domestic demand, the 
deficit in commodity trade is expected to widen, 

while the services balance is expected to continue 

benefitting from expanding tourism. Overall, the 

current account situation is likely to deteriorate in 

2015- 2016.  
Primary surpluses contribute to debt reduction The government's fiscal target for 2015 of a 

largely balanced budget is well in line with the 

underlying economic growth projections. 

However, plans to lower the tax burden might 

result in a slight deficit in 2016, of about 0.3% of 

GDP. Substantial primary surpluses (of some 3% 

of GDP) should help to reduce the general 

government debt-to-GDP ratio to close to 74% by 

2016. Government plans to sell state assets in 

order to lower the public debt burden could lead to 

an even faster reduction in the debt ratio.

 Uncertainties and risks stemming from the 2008 
crisis are not overcome yet Settling still existing claims towards banks in 
insolvency could lead 
to substantial current-
account outflows. Lifting cap

remains a major challenge. Furthermore, higher 

imports due to strong domestic demand could 

create additional pressure 
on external accounts, the 
exchange rate and domestic price stability.

Tourism resorts, tunnels and bridges 
 128 Economic activity slowed down in 2014 
compared to the previous year Several factors contributed to dampening growth 
performance in 2014, including the negative 

effects of floods in neighbouring countries, delay 

of some important investment projects and weaker 

than expected external 
demand. Overall, private 
consumption and gross fixed capital formation 

were the main drivers of growth in 2014. 
The methodological revision of GDP data by the

pps.
 The macroeconomic outlook seems to 
improve Key drivers of economic growth identified in the 
winter forecast continue supporting the expansion 

of economic activity in 2015. As a result, growth 

could reach 3%, and steer gradually above 

potential in 2016, on account of the 4-year 

construction of a highway (worth about 20% of 

GDP) as well as ongoing works on several large 

tourism resorts. Private 
consumption seems also 
set to strengthen, thanks to some recovery of credit 

growth stimulated by the entry of three new banks 

in the market and the implementation of domestic 
banks' strategies for reduction of non-performing 
loans. Unsolved issues in the aluminium smelter 

and ongoing capital overhaul in the steel factory 

will linger during 2015, postponing to 2016 the 

recovery of stocks. 
External imbalances will temporarily deepen The current account defic
it will broaden in the 
coming years fuelled by internal demand and the 

strong import-dependency of investments, while 

industrial production remains weak. In 2015, 

works on several tourism resorts and on the 

highway are worth about 7% and 5% of GDP 

respectively. Similar Œ if not higher Œ amounts 

could be expected for 2016 too, driving up 

construction-related imports, and broadening the 

trade deficit. Early indicat
ors show that the number 
of tourists might grow in 2015; suggesting the 

services balance could pe
rform better than a year 
before, with positive spill-over effects on retail 

trade, transport, accomm
odation and catering. On 
the other hand, an incr
ease in the number of 
foreign workers would have a negative impact on 

factor income and transfers balances. The 

financing of the external deficit appears supported 

in the medium-term by FDI inflows (mostly into 

real estate and tourism)
 together with a loan 
securing 85% of the highway financing, which 

includes a 6-year grace period. 
Construction will support employment Accelerating economic ac
tivity should
 allow for 
further improvements in labour market conditions. 

However, it is not yet clear to which extent the 

local workforce may benefit given its limited 

mobility and the employer
s preference for cheaper 
foreign labour. Besides, the highway agreement 

foresees 70% of the work to
 be realised by Chinese 
companies. 
Inflation is shaped by lower euro and oil prices 2014 was characterised by deflationary trends, 

mostly reflecting a prolonged decline in food and 

oil prices, two items portraying the largest weight 
Growth is expected to accelerate driven by investm
ent; notably in a motorway with numerous (and 
expensive) tunnels and bridges, several tourist reso
rts, and some recovery 
of banks' lending activity 
supporting private consumption. However, the debt-
financed highway will also
 strain on government 
finances, fuelling budget deficits and public debt l
evels, in particular in case of cost overruns. 
Candidate Countries, Montenegro 
  129 in the consumer's basket. Preliminary data for 
early 2015 signals an end to disinflation. Further 

acceleration of headline inflation could be 

expected after mid-year, benefitting from low base 

effects of oil prices. Th
e recovery of private 
consumption and employment could also further 

reinforce consumer prices in 2016. 
2014 budget execution presents a significant 
improvement compared with previous year In 2014, the deficit declined to 1.5% of GDP 
compared to revised 5.3%
 of GDP a year before, 
offering a primary surplus of 0.8% of GDP. The 

improvement appears concentrated on the revenue 

side, expanding by 8% y-o-y to 46% of GDP 

driven by the strong performance of VAT, social 

security contributions, fees and personal income 

tax. The expenditure side increased more 

moderately, by 1.2% y-o-y, to 47.3% of GDP. The  
deviation with the plan results from the increase of 
state equity in the electric power company and the 

disbursement of state guarantees. 
Main risks appear on the fiscal side The financing of the highway will challenge fiscal 

stability. Based on rough preliminary estimates 

from the capital budget, we project the budget 

deficit and the public debt levels to stretch well 

above the Montenegrin fiscal rules limits of 3% 

and 60% of GDP for 2015 and 2016, respectively. 

Yet, these projections could worsen in case of 

unanticipated cost overruns. The fiscal position of 

municipalities also appears particularly exposed, 

with growing contingent liabilities related to 

payment arrears to their providers, but also 

towards the tax administration and social security 

funds.

   32. SERBIA 
Sprouts of growth  130 Some signs of a turnaround– Weak domestic and external demand, elevated 
uncertainty and heavy floods in the spring have 

pushed the economy into a recession in 2014. Real 

GDP contracted by 1.8% as both private 

consumption and gross fixed capital formation 

growth remained negative. However, in the last 

quarter of the year recessionary forces seem to 

have abated and the economy expanded by a 

seasonally adjusted 0.4%
 in comparison to the 
previous quarter. The contraction decelerated 

across all sectors and some of them, like 

construction, even turned to growth. Exports, 

which have declined in the third quarter, recovered 

albeit still marginally. After falling for about two 

years, investments levelled off. 
High frequency indicators have also signalled a 
possible turnaround of economic activity. Since 

the last quarter of 2014, there was a clear pick-up 

in industrial and, in particular, manufacturing 

activity. Exports continued to make gains also in 

early 2015 and labour market indicators improved 

further. In addition, retail trade and government 

revenue performance turned out better than 

expected. 
–but not out of the woods yet. Economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2014 

was supported by a revival of credit, underpinned 

by a programme of government subsidised 

lending, and an increase in government 

expenditure. As both have been of transitory 

nature, and government spending is set to fall 

under the current agreement with the IMF, the 

expected recovery is envi
saged to be protracted. 
The planned fiscal consolidation and far-reaching 
structural reforms have 
a decisive impact on the 
forecast profile. On one hand
, they are expected to 
dent private and public consumption, which are 

forecast to contribute nega
tively to growth in the 
next two years, despite gains from lower oil prices. 

On the other hand, they should also reduce the 
country™s risk premium, boost potential growth 
and rebuild the basis for sustainable economic 

growth. In line with this, the forecast foresees a 

progressive strengthening of investment activity, 

spurred by improvements in the business 

environment and reduced risk and uncertainty. A 

strengthening of external demand from the EU Œ 

Serbia's most important trade partner, is expected 

to support continuing exports growth and the 

ongoing rebalancing away from consumption. 

However, balancing fiscal consolidation and the 

ambitious structural reforms agenda against 

short-term growth prospects, in a highly uncertain 

international environment, would remain a key 

challenge. Indeed, there is a non-negligible risk 

that the first offshoots of growth fade out before 

the economy sets on a stable growth path.

 Labour market indicators continued to improve in 
the fourth quarter and unemployment fell to 16.8% 

according to the Labour 
force survey. However, 
employment gains in 2014 were driven 

predominantly by informal employment, while 

formal private sector employment declined. As the 

announced restructuring of state-owned enterprises 

gathers pace and the government revisits public 

employment, unemployment is foreseen to 

increase from a still very high level. Weak demand 

is likely to remain a major disinflationary factor 

and price stability is expected to be preserved 
The economy is expected to slowly emerge from the 
recession but growth prospects remain fragile. Base 
effects, lower oil prices, and in
creased confidence, following the 
recently approved 3-year agreement 
with the IMF are likely to underpin a rebound of gross capital formation, while stronger external 

demand is foreseen to pull expor
ts up. However, uncertainties abo
und and employment and private 
consumption are set to remain weak. 
Candidate Countries, Serbia

domestic prices would still be subject to pressure 

and uncertainties stemming from further

 Strong consolidation efforts Fiscal imbalances increased as the slow pace of 
reforms continued to weigh on the budget and the 

overall deficit expanded to reach 6.7% of GDP in 
2014. However, the 2014 budget deficit was lower 
than planned in the initial and the supplementary 

budgets. The better than ex
pected outturn came as 
a result of significant under-execution of capital 

expenditure and of social expenditure savings due 

to delays in the restructuring of public enterprises. 
The budget deficit is foreseen to come down 
significantly as a result of a sizeable current 

expenditure retrenchment. The main adjustment is 

from the reduction in pensions and public sector 

wages, adopted in 2014, pension and wage freezes, 

lower subsidies and public 
enterprises reform. As a 
result, the budget deficit is expected to fall below 

5% of GDP in 2015. Further cuts in the deficit 

would depend on the implementation of the 

announced public administration reform and the 

restructuring of state-owned enterprises. 
Despite strong consolidation efforts, government 
debt will most likely continue increasing, 

surpassing 80% of GDP. Debt reducing effects 

from real GDP growth a
nd inflation are forecasted 
to remain rather small, while rising interest 

payments put a burden on the debt. Exchange rate 

volatility would remain a major factor of 

uncertainty regarding future debt dynamics.

  33. TURKEY 
Lower oil price provides much-needed support 
 132 A rebalancing of growth in 2014 Economic activity in Turk
ey decelerated to an 
annual growth rate of 2.9% in 2014. Consumer 

spending softened mainly in response to macro-

prudential measures to rein in household 

borrowing. Private investment remained very 

subdued for a third consecutive year. Public 

investment retrenched after a surge in the 

preceding year which mean
t that overall public 
spending hardly contributed to GDP growth. 
Sluggish domestic demand was to a large extent 
offset by improving net exports which benefitted 

from a more competitive exchange rate in the early 

part of the year and from sharply lower imports of 

non-monetary gold. Overall exports of goods and 

services increased by almost 7% in spite of 

declining exports to Russia, Ukraine and Iraq 

which are important trading partners of Turkey. 
The central bank has resumed easing When Turkey's financial markets and the lira came 

under strong downward pressure in the winter of 

2013-14, the central bank tightened monetary 

policy significantly. Subsequently, the currency 

recovered and the risk premium on Turkish assets 

declined, allowing the central bank to lower the 

main policy rate, the one-week repo rate, gradually 

to 8.25% by July. With headline inflation hovering 

around 9%, the central bank refrained from 

additional cuts in its key policy rate in the 

remainder of the year. In January and February 

2015, however, the central bank lowered the one-

week repo rate in two steps to 7.5% following 

slightly improving inflation data and pressure from 

the president and parts of the government. 
Private domestic demand will again become 
the main driver of growth Despite the recent depreciation against the US 
dollar, the Turkish lira was up by 7.4% year-on-

year in real effective terms in March 2015. This 

has once more reduced Turkey's international price 
competitiveness and is expected to impede the 
export performance in th
e forecasting period. 
Exports will also be hurt by lower energy prices 

which tend to suppress growth in many of Turkey's 

traditional markets (Russia, Middle East). At the 

same time, imports will be stimulated by 

improving terms of trade. Consequently, the 

contribution from net exports to GDP growth is 

projected to turn negative again.

Turkey -Real GDP growth and contributions
 On the domestic side, private consumption 
expenditure is likely to recover from last year's 

sluggishness in the context of the lower oil price 

and stronger employment growth. The recent 

easing of monetary policy should also provide 

some stimulus to consumption through lower bank 

lending rates although the macro-prudential 

measures from 2013-14 will continue to restrain 

household borrowing. Gross fixed capital 

formation is projected to increase moderately over 

the forecast period in view of the improving 

prospects for consumer demand and lower interest 

rates and production costs. 
Firmer growth and somewhat lower inflation Economic data for the first months of 2015 have 

been relatively weak. Business and consumer 

sentiments have even fallen to the lowest level 

since the recession in 2009, possibly related to the 
The economic slowdown, which started in the spring of 2014, has turned out to be more protracted than 
previously expected. The real appreciation of the Turk
ish lira is likely to hamper export growth, but at 
the same time the economy will benefit from the lowe
r oil price. Inflation is expected to decline 
moderately, growth is projected to strengthen by 
the rise in consumers' purchasing power, and the 
reduced outlay for imported energy should narrow the current account deficit.  
Candidate Countries, Turkey 
  133 uncertainties about the outcome of general 
elections on 7 June. The present forecast expects 

that underlying growth-supporting conditions will 

result in some strengthening of domestic demand 

in the course of 2015. Hence, annual GDP growth 

is projected to increase to 3.2% in 2015 and further 

to 3.7% in 2016. One downsi
de risk to this forecast 
is the possibility of a renewed sell-off in Turkish 

financial assets when the Federal Reserve starts 

raising its policy rate. This could require a 

tightening of Turkish monetary policy with 

negative repercussions for domestic demand. 

Another risk is a renewed worsening of the 

conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. 
Employment growth is expected to run somewhat 
below output growth consistent with relatively 

slow trend growth in labour productivity in recent 

years. Annual average un
employment is projected 
at around 10½% for the labour force aged 15-64 

years, based on the assumption that the labour 

force will increase at around the trend growth rate 

of recent years. Helped 
by the lower oil price, 
annual average consumer price inflation is 

expected to fall to 7% in 2015, i.e. still 2 pps. 

above target. Inflation is pr
ojected to rise again in 
2016 as GDP growth approaches its potential. 
Turkey's large current accou
nt deficit narrowed to 
5.7% of GDP in 2014, much helped by lower 

imports of non-monetary gold. In 2015, the lower 

oil price should reduce the deficit further to a 

projected 4.4% of GDP. In 2016, the assumed 

firming of the oil price and continued 

strengthening of domestic demand should result in 

a modest widening of the current account deficit. 
Public finances remain stable and sustainable The central government reco
rded a budget deficit 
of 1.3% of GDP in 2014, up by 0.1 pps. from the 

preceding year, but lower than the initial and 

revised official targets of 1.9% and 1.4%, 

respectively. The better-than-planned performance 

was helped by privatisation revenues. The forecast 

estimates a general government deficit of 1.5% of 

GDP in 2014 and projects it to decline slightly in 

the following two years in tune with firmer GDP 

growth and accelerating tax revenues. 
The public debt-to-GDP ratio continued its 
downward trend in 2014, falling to 33.5%. On the 

basis of the current projecti
ons for the fiscal deficit 
and nominal GDP, the debt ratio should decline 

further in the following two years.

  34. ALBANIA 
Gradual upturn underway  134 Economic activity strengthens in 2014 Economic recovery continued in the fourth quarter 
of 2014, with real gross value added (GVA) rising 

2.4% y-o-y. Buoyant construction activity, which 

was lifted by a year-end acceleration of public 

investment projects, as well as a continuing 

increase in services, contributed most to growth. 

On the other hand, industry™s expansion was 

subdued, partly due to the negative impact of 

falling oil prices on extraction activity.  
The statistical institute will publish its preliminary 
estimate for GDP growth in 2014 only at a later 

stage, but based on quarterly GVA data (and 

taking also into account the upward revision of 

third-quarter growth to 3.9%), the economy 

expanded by 1.9% in 2014, compared with 1.4% a 

year earlier.  Domestic demand spurs growth A continued improvement in economic sentiment 

and retail trade indicators in October to December 

suggests that the upturn in growth is being driven 

by domestic demand. Household confidence 

weakened somewhat, but 
the pace of job creation 
remained healthy in the fourth quarter, even if the 

expansion in the labour force has meant that the 

unemployment rate also increased.  
Consumers™ purchasing power continues to benefit 
from low inflation. The fall in the oil price, low 

inflation in trading partners and subdued inflation 

expectations have kept the annual rate of price 

increase in the first quarter at 1.9%, below the 

lower band of the central bank™s target range of 

3% ±1 pp. Given that the economy still has scope 

to eliminate slack, inflatio
n is expected to return 
only gradually towards the target. 
The upswing in the business cycle gets support 
from a reform-minded government, which is 

making good progress on clearing the large stock  
of arrears it owes to businesses, boosting private-
sector liquidity. Some larg
e projects in the energy 
sector, such as the construction of the Trans-

Adriatic Pipeline™s Albanian section, will further 

lift investment in the years to come.

Albania -Real GDP growth and contributions
 On the other hand, the timid uptick in lending is 
vulnerable to the still unfinished repair of bank 

balance sheets. Despite continued monetary 

accommodation and a record-low policy rate of 

2%, credit growth remains sluggish (3% y-o-y in 

February). One of the main factors behind this is 

the high proportion of non-performing loans, 

peaking at 24.9% in the third quarter of 2014, 

which makes banks reluctant to extend new credit. 

Recently, the government and the central bank 

have pledged to redouble efforts to tackle this 

issue, which also feat
ures prominently under 
Albania™s current IMF prog
ramme. Therefore, we 
expect NPLs to decline and lending activity to pick 

up gradually. 
On the supply side, negative shocks such as floods 
that hit Southern Albania in February, and the 

slowdown in oil extraction in the wake of sharply 

lower oil prices, are expected to be offset by an 

improved contribution of electricity production to 

growth. 
The latest data confirm that the gradual pick-up in growth, driven by private domestic demand, 
continues. It is supported by the continuing clearance of government arrears as well as monetary 

accommodation. A stronger revival in lending to the economy requires tackling non-performing loans, 

to which the authorities have expressed renewed comm
itment. Fiscal consolidation is projected to 
continue along with some major reforms, including in the energy sector, which could boost long-term 

growth prospects. 
Candidate Countries, Albania 
  135 External deficit set to rise  The fall in oil prices sharply reduced growth in the 
value of exports and imports in the second half of 

2014. Overall, bigger de
ficits in the trade and 
primary income balances could not be offset by a 

pick-up in remittances 
from abroad, and the 
current account shortfall rose to 13% of GDP in 

2014. The increase in domes
tic absorption is likely 
to lead to a further widening of the external deficit; 

however, it is expected to be financed mainly by 

foreign direct investment inflows, mitigating 

external vulnerabilities.  
Fiscal consolidation to continue  Tax rises and continuing tax collection gains are 

expected to underpin a reduction in the headline 

budget deficit in 2015. Should revenues 

underperform, sizeable contingency reserves 

would cushion the impact on the deficit, although 

they would mostly mean a reduction in public 

investment, which is undesirable given Albania™s 
significant need to increase its capital stock. On 
the expenditure side, the gradual phasing out of 

expenses linked to arrears clearance will also help 

improve the budget balance in the years to come.   
The projected trajectory 
of the budget deficit, 
which is largely in line with official targets, would 

contribute to slightly lowering debt as a percentage 

of GDP already in 2015. A marked fall in the debt 

ratio is however not expected before 2016. 
Contingent liabilities originating from the 
hydropower-based electri
city sector and the 
property compensation scheme still constitute 

downside risks to the outlook. However, the 

government has introduced a number of measures 

to reform the energy sector, with some first 

positive signs of a turnaround already visible, such 

as a fall in distribution losses and improved bill 

collection rates. Sustaine
d and successful reform 
efforts in this field may ultimately eliminate a key 

fiscal risk and remove a major obstacle to long-

term growth.

Solid growth amid a strengthening dollar 
 138 Robust recovery The US recovery remains on track, despite a 
weaker-than-expected start of the year, as a broad-

based recovery continues, led by private 

consumption and investment. Growth is expected 

to remain strong in the forecast horizon, as the 

cycle matures amid a buoyant labour market, low 

energy prices, a continued support from 

accommodative monetary policy and a waning 

fiscal drag. However, the near-term outlook 

moderated somewhat compared to the Winter 

Forecast, as severe winter became a drag on 

activity in the first quarter, while the rebound in 

energy prices and the appreciating dollar is set to 

weigh on consumption and net exports.  
Real GDP expanded by a somewhat weaker-than-
expected 0.5% q-o-q in the fourth quarter of 2014, 

much less than in the previous two quarters, 

putting growth at 2.4% for the year as a whole. 

Growth in the fourth quarter was driven by private 

consumption which rose 1.0% (the most since 

2006Q1), as gains from ch
eaper energy interacted 
with a strong labour market to boost household 

spending. However, a stronger dollar weighed on 

net exports, which erased 0.3 pps. from growth.  
Labour market recovery advances The recovery in the labour market is in full swing, 

with strong job gains in early 2015 despite difficult 

winter conditions in many parts of the country. 

Hiring has averaged 275,000 over the twelve 

months up to February 2015, the best 12-monthly 

outturn in 15 years. The unemployment rate fell to 

5.5% in February, back to the pre-crisis level, and 

close to estimates of the NAIRU. However, labour 

force participation remained
 largely flat since early 
2014, indicating that a cyclical pick-up in 

participation has only just been sufficient to offset 

the negative demographic trend.  
As the economy strengthens, job creation is 
expected to remain solid, bringing the 

unemployment rate down to 5% in 2016. A 
cyclical expansion of the labour force is likely to 
prevent more decisive declines in the 

unemployment rate in the forecast horizon. 
Buoyant labour market gradually generates 
prices and wage pressures  Despite the recovery in the labour market, nominal 
wage growth remains subdued, while consumer 

prices are temporarily dragged down by cheap 

energy. Lower inflation is set to boost real wages 

in 2015, which otherwise have been surprisingly 

weak given the stage of the cycle (around 2%  

y-o-y and roughly flat for 2 years). Further in the 

course of the forecast hori
zon, both price and wage 
pressures are expected to pick up, as the effect of 

the falling energy prices wanes, and the 

unemployment gap gradually turns positive.

considerably in 2015, as lower inflation will 

interact with a buoyant labour market to boost 

spending. Domestic demand will be further 

supported by the expect
ed gradual rebound in 
government spending.  
Business investment is expected to strengthen 
gradually. A temporary weakness in the energy 
The outlook for the US economy remains strong, alt
hough weakened somewhat since the winter as the 
boost from low energy prices is moderated by the 
negative impact of the stro
nger dollar. However, the 
continued support from accommodative monetary policy and a gradually waning fiscal drag should help 

push growth above potential in the forecast horizon. Real GDP growth is revised down to 3.1% (from 

3.5% in the Winter Forecast) in 2015, and to 3.0% (from 3.2%) in 2016.  
Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America 
  139 sector will likely be offset by a stronger rebound in 
other sectors, where a positive energy-related 

supply shock interacts with firming domestic 

demand, still conducive financing conditions and 

record-high corporate profits. Despite 
disappointing recent activity and sales, the housing 

market is expected to advance its hesitant 

recovery. Pent-up demand for new homes should 

unfold gradually, in line with the expected 

acceleration in household formation, supported by 

secure employment prosp
ects and largely healed balance sheets. 
Deteriorating net exports However, the outlook for net exports has 

deteriorated further due to the progressively 

strengthening dollar, wh
ich appreciated, since 
early July 2014, by as much as 25% against the 

euro and roughly 15% on 
average against its major 
trade partners. While both
 imports and exports are 
still expected to accelerate 
in the forecast horizon, 
imports have been marked up from the previous 

forecast, in line with the exchange rate 

developments. This implies a downward revision 

of net exports, which are 
now expected to subtract 
0.4 pps. from growth in both 2015 and 2016.  
Supportive policy mix despite the nearing 
monetary normalisation  The policy environment is expected to remain 
broadly unchanged, with a progressively shrinking 

fiscal drag and a continued highly accommodative 

monetary policy set to support activity in the 

forecast horizon. The general government deficit 

fell below 5% in 2014, for the first time since 

2007, and fiscal consolid
ation is expected to 
continue in the forecast horizon at a significantly 

milder pace compared to 
previous years. Smaller 
deficits will lead to a stabilisation of the debt level 

just below 105% of GDP. 
In its forward guidance accompanying the March 
statement the Fed dropped the pledge to be 

"patient" before deciding to raise interest rate. 

However, the timing of the "lift-off" is by no 

means clear, as the deci
sion has been further 
complicated by the streng
thening dollar, and the 
overall difficulty of gauging the stage of the cycle 

given the continued absence of wage pressures and 

slowing inflation. While Fed
s projections 
continue to point to 2015 as the start of the cycle 

of cautious interest rates increases, market 

expectations have widened considerably to include 

2016.

led to a

.   In 2015 
and 2016 
domestic demand is 
set 
to

private consumption and investment spurred 
by 
a moderate pick
-up in wage growth, postponed fiscal 
consolidation,
 accommodative 
monetary policy
, and 
favourable investment conditions. 
Net exports 
will 
contribute to lift growth 
underpinned by 
firmer 
global 
demand
 and 
further improving 
external competitiveness
. Real GDP growth is 
forecast at 1.

expected to pick
 up at 1.4% in 2016.

recovery in domestic 
demand–
 The monthly private consumption integrated 
estimate 
still 
point
s to some weakness in c
onsumer 
spending 
stretching 
into 2015. 
However consumer 
sentiment has been improving 
in recent months
, the unemployment rate is stable at a low level 

(3.5% in February), and total cash wages have 

been rising moderately (0.5% y
-o-y in February). 
Labour market conditions and wage data 
thus 
suggest a 
gradual recovery ahead
. Firmer corporate 
activity and a shrinking 
working age population 
are set to 
keep labour market
 conditions
 tight
, with 
an unemployment rate of around 3.5% over the 
forecast horizon. 
High 
labour market dualism will 
continue 
however 
to dampen wage growth ahead. 
Against this ba
ckdrop w
age growth is expected to 
pick up 
only 
moderately 
but 
remain above CPI 
inflation, underpinning private consumption.
  Public investment is set to be scaled back as fiscal 

consolidation progresses
. However
, its decline
 should be more than offset by a pick
-up in 
business 
investment
 spurred by 
improving 
domestic and external demand, 
favourable 

investment conditions
, a more benign tax 
environment ahead, 
and 
higher 
corporate 
profitability
 further supported by lower oil pric
e levels. 
 Private residential investment is 
projected
 to 
gradually recover 
underpinned

 Headline CPI inflation 
accelerated throughout 

2013 and peaked at 3.7% (1.7% excluding the

Core

CPI inflation (excluding fresh food and energy) 

has been declining
 as well
, pointing to 
weak 
underlying inflation dynamics.
 Lower energy 
prices and the waning effect from the 2014 

consumption tax hike are set to keep headline CPI 

inflation below 1% in 2015
, and close to 1% in 
2016 on the back of 
only 
a moderate pick

nominal wage growth. 
Monetary policy is

.  Risks
 Risks are mainly tilted to the downside and 

domestic. The Japanese economy remains exposed

Abenomics agenda
, and to the 
need to draw up a 
detailed and 
credible medium
-term fiscal plan to 
rein in Japan
s high debt

In 
particular, investment and wages may continue to 

respond only weakly to continued favourable

   37. CHINA 
Growth holds up, despite investment slowdown 
 142 China
s economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, following 
growth of 7.8% in 2013. Although growth 

continues to edge down from the peak of over 10% 

reported in 2010, the outcome in 2014 proved 

remarkably solid given the ongoing downturn in 

the property market. Looser monetary policy and 

fiscal stimulus measures helped to prop up growth 

in mid-year, before a rebound in exports in the 

second half of the year pushed growth back 

towards the official target for 2014 of 7.5%. 

Consumption grew solidly, contributing 51% of 

growth, while net exports made a positive 

contribution to growth for the first time in several 

years. In contrast, investment slowed down 

notably, with (nominal) growth in fixed asset 

investment dropping to 15% annually by year-end, 

from around 20% or higher in recent years. 

However, full official data on contributions to 

growth for 2014 is not yet available. 
Early 2015 saw some deterioration in high 
frequency indicators. Industrial value added 

dropped sharply, with growth of just 5.6% in 

March, compared to rates of over 8% seen during 

most of 2014. PMIs also worsened, with the 

official NBS measure moving below 50 in 

February for the first time since 2012. Growth of 

retail sales fell below 11% for the first time in 

nearly ten years, though if deflated by consumer 

prices the real growth rate appears similar to that 

seen through much of 2014. Real estate data 

continued to show weakness, with the growth of 

investment continuing to slow. Exports remained 

buoyant, however, and despite the weak data,  

2015-Q1 GDP came in at 7%, in line with the 

official growth target for 2015 of "approximately 

7%" set at the March National Peoples
 Conference.  
The forecast is for growth to moderate further in 
2015 to 7.0% and 6.8% in 2016. This assumes a 

relatively benign correction in the property market, 

stabilization of growth in fixed asset investment, 

and continued steady growth of consumption. 

Lower oil prices should provide support, while 

policy is likely to respond flexibly if growth 
appears to be moving too far out of line with the 
official growth target.  Monetary policy likely to remain steady, while 
fiscal policy will be flexible Monetary policy was eased in early 2014 as signs 
of slowing growth emerged, and interbank rates 

remained well below 4% throughout 2014. 

November also saw the first cut in headline policy 

rates for over two years, with a further 25 bps. cut 

in February 2015. However,
 with falling inflation, 
real rates have remained fairly stable. The pace of 

credit growth slowed substantially in 2014, but 

remained faster than GDP growth. Looking 

forward, monetary policy is likely to remain on a 

steady course provided de
mand does not weaken 
dramatically. While lower policy rates would help 

support the property sector and investment, this 

would lower deposit income for households, 

thereby restraining consumption.

Real GDP growth
 Fiscal policy is likely to be flexible and responsive 
in 2015. Although the official budget deficit is 

notionally set to widen from 2.1% to 2.4%, this 

figure does not capture shifts in off-balance sheet 

spending by local government. Falling property 

related revenues may lead to some slowing of the 

growth of local government spending during 2015, 

introducing some fiscal dr
ag. However, the annual 
China
s economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, weathering the effects of a sharp property market downturn 
remarkably well, with consumption growing steadily and exports growing rapidly, largely offsetting the 

effects of slower growth in investment. Early 2015 saw renewed weakness in high frequency indicators, 

but growth is expected to remain close to 7% this yea
r, underpinned by lower oil prices, faster growth in 
the Asia region, with the likelihood of further policy loosening should domestic demand continue to flag.
Other non-EU Countries, China 
  143 growth target remains highly symbolic, and signs 
of significant weakness in domestic demand are 

likely to lead with a fine-tuning of the flow of 

investment approvals, or other targeted fiscal 

measures to keep growth near its target.  
Lower oil prices will provide useful support The recent fall in the oil price will help support 

growth, with lower energy prices reinforcing the 

downward pressure on CPI inflation, which had 

already fallen to around 1.5% at the end of 2014. 

Household income growth was marginally faster 

than GDP growth in 2014, and this trend is 

expected to continue through 2015. Lower oil 

prices should also ease pr
essure on the industrial 
sector which continues to face a difficult 

environment, with persistent excess capacity in 

some key sectors and producer prices that have 

been falling for over two years. Producer prices for 

early 2015 show a fall of nearly 5% y-o-y, raising 

some concerns over debt deflation. Growth in 

investment is expected to stabilise at rates close to 

those seen in late 2014, though the weakness in the 

property market may have further to run.  
China
s imports were flat in value terms during 
2014, while exports grew by 6% over the same 

period, picking up sharply from June onwards. 

This divergence continued into early 2015. Low 
import demand appears to reflect weak domestic 
demand in general as well as some structural shifts 

due to the investment slowdown. The strong export 

performance in the second half of 2014 and early 

2015 came in spite of a 
6% rise in the real 
effective exchange rate between December 2013 

and December 2014, tho
ugh most of this 
strengthening of the RMB came in the last quarter 

of the year. The outperformance by exports may 

continue well into 2015 due to the continuing 

recovery in the US, and the prospect of faster 

growth in the Asian region, where a number of 

other economies will also benefit substantially 

from lower oil prices.  
Risks remain tilted to the downside The major short term risk factors remain those 

linked to accumulated imbalances, notably the 

legacy of debt from high levels of investment 

spending, the risk of a worsening of outlook for the 

property sector, and risks to the financial sector 

from exposure to overleveraged borrowers. The 

deflationary environment 
faced by producers is 
likely to accentuate these ri
sks. However, balanced 
against this is the possibility of outperformance 

due to the positive impacts of lower oil prices, both 

for China itself and for buyers of Chinese exports.

  38. EFTA 
Moderation follows the year-end bonus  144 Although GDP growth for the fourth quarter 2014 
surprised to the upside co
mpared with forecasts for 
both Switzerland and Norway, the driving forces 

were different. In the case of Switzerland, the 

surprise was due to net foreign demand. In the case 

of Norway, the surprise
 was due to domestic 
demand. In both countrie
s we expect that the 
forces behind the growth surprises will lose some 

of their vigour. 
Switzerland Professional forecasters have significantly reduced 

their growth forecast numb
ers in response to the 
SNB abandoning the EURCHF floor on  

15 January. On average they expect 0.6% growth 

in 2015 and 1.1% in 2016. However, given the 

strengthening of growth at the end of 2014, this 

would imply a recession in 2015. 
Although a recession cannot be excluded, the 
expectation in this forecast is that it will be 

avoided. Swiss exporters have had to deal with an 

appreciating currency for 
many years already. It 
has led to export specialization in niche markets 

that shielded Switzerland from the worst of the 

global financial and the euro-area sovereign debt 

crises. Foreign competition is more likely to come 

from innovations, like the smart watch, than from 

price competition. Moreover, the first impact on 

net trade of the Swiss franc
s appreciation will 
likely be positive through 
a J-curve effect that 
limits the negative impact of the appreciation in 

the first half of 2015. This view is supported by 

Januarys increase in the trade surplus.  
Over the full year 2014 the contribution of 
domestic demand to economic growth was the 

lowest since the global financial crisis. Private 

consumption has been an important driver of 

economic growth in Switzerland but registered 

growth of only 0.4% in 2014 (average  

2010-13: 1.8%). According to SECO
s consumer 
confidence survey, cons
umer confidence was 
improving ahead of the SNB decision on  
15 January. Following the SNB decision, 
consumers have become particularly pessimistic in 

their intentions to consume goods with a high price 

tag. This is likely to have an impact on 

consumption. After three years of negative 

contributions, stock building will again contribute 

positively to economic growth.  
In light of the relatively subdued domestic 
demand, the impact of the appreciation of the 

Swiss franc on net exports and the recent adverse 

developments in consumer sentiment, a slowing-

down of economic growth to 1.2% is expected in 

2015. For 2016, economic growth would slightly 

increase to 1.3% which is well below the potential 

growth rate of the Swiss economy.

 Deflation will be reinforced by both the direct 
effects of the appreciatio
n of the Swiss franc and 
indirect effects like the stock building mentioned 

above and second round e
ffects from the labour 
market. 
Norway Even though the fourth quarter of 2014 presented a 

positive surprise, the Norwegian economic outlook 

has become less bright. The positive fourth quarter 
Economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was relatively strong for both Norway and Switzerland 
but is expected to lose momentum in 2015 in both countries. The appreciation of the Swiss franc 

vis-à-vis the euro will weigh on foreign demand wh
ile domestic demand already lost traction. In 
Norway, domestic demand has been 
more solid. However, the halving of 
the oil price since the middle of 
last year will impact on-shore investment and employment dynamics. The fall in the Norwegian Krone 

will have a positive impact on the non-oil trade balance. 
Other non-EU Countries, EFTA 
  145 result was accompanied by a revision of earlier 
quarters that leads to a carry-over into 2015.  
The indications for household consumption are 
conflicting as the last quarter of 2014 still showed 

robust consumer demand 
but consumer confidence 
was at the lowest level since 2010 in January of 

this year. The robustness of consumer demand can 

be explained in part by the low interest rates that 

push the purchase of consumer durables. As the 

labour market conditions become more difficult, 

private consumption will come under pressure.  
The main driver of the slowdown in domestic 
demand growth in 2015 is investment which is also 

the domestic demand component most directly 

impacted by the fall in the oil price. 
Over the past two year
s the Krona depreciated 
almost 20%. It has more recently appreciated 

against the euro while the depreciation momentum 

against the USD seems to have waned. 

Nonetheless, the im
provement in price 
competitiveness due to the nominal and real 

effective depreciation over 
the past year will allow  
Norwegian companies to profit from growth in 
export markets. 
Although the depreciation in
creases the prices of 
imported goods, the cooling of the economy and 

the lower oil prices are expected to have a bigger 

impact on the inflation rate. The HICP inflation 

rate is expected to de
crease to just above two 
percent in 2015 and 2016.

  39. RUSSIAN FEDERATION 
Recession triggered by low oil prices and sanctions 
 146 Recession materialising amidst lower oil prices 
and sanctions– Economic growth in Russia has been on a 
declining trend for some time as diversification of 

the economy away from the energy sector made 

little progress and investment stalled. These trends 

were exacerbated by the collapse in oil prices and 

economic sanctions, which led to severe market 

turbulence, record rouble depreciation and a sharp 

deterioration of economic confidence towards the 

end of 2014.

pps.
 In this context real GDP growth slowed down to 
0.6% in 2014 due to a contraction of investment 

and a deceleration of private consumption, on the 

back of record capital outflows, soaring borrowing 

costs and rising inflation. Some support came from 

net exports and resilience in manufacturing and 

finance. 
The combination of much lower oil prices and 
economic sanctions are pushing the Russian 

economy into recession in 2015, with several key 

indicators having fallen in negative territory in the 

first months of the year (e.g. retail sales and 

industrial production). For 2016 some stabilisation 

is projected, based on the technical assumption of 

sanctions expiring in July 2015 and also given the 

slight rebound in oil prices. At the same time, 

market pressures have somewhat subsided since 
the start of 2015 amid stabilising oil prices and a 
lighter payment schedule on foreign debt, with the 

rouble recovering part of its earlier loss and 

renewed investors
 interest on Russian assets. 
–triggered by a collapse in investment and a 
fall in consumption. The fall in investment is expected to deepen 
sharply in 2015, reflecting sanctions which 

continue to constrain access to Western capital 

markets for major Russian banks and corporations, 

increased borrowing cost
s, persistent (albeit 
somewhat subsiding) capital outflows, political 

and economic uncertainty and a deteriorated 

business environment. 
Private consumption is expected to fall in 2015 for 
the first time since 1999 (with the exception of the 

2009 crisis), reflecting a slump in real wages 

(which has started to materialise in December) 

mainly resulting from soaring inflation caused by 

rouble depreciation and the ban on certain Western 

food imports. Moreover, the room for public 

wages and pensions increase is constrained by 

fiscal consolidation pressures to tackle the foreseen 

increase of the federal deficit. A moderate 

consumption recovery is ex
pected in 2016 amid a 
gradual return to growth and moderating inflation. 
After remaining flat in 2014 (-0.1% growth) export 
growth is expected to turn negative in 2015, as pre-

existing structural bottlenecks and collapsing 

investments prevent Russian firms from reaping 

the benefit of a falling rouble. Within  

energy-related exports (b
y far the biggest export 
item) a reduction of crude oil exports in 2014 was 

by and large offset by an increase in exports of 

refined petroleum products. Exports are set to 

recover somewhat in 2016 given the assumed 

easing of geopolitical tension and a gradual pick 

up of oil prices as well as a strengthening of 

external demand. Imports are expected to 

experience a double digit 
contraction in 2015, on 
the back of falling domestic demand and sharp 

rouble depreciation, whereas
 only a small effect is 
expected from the so-called "import substitution 
After a pronounced slow-down already in 2014, Russia is moving into recession in 2015 due to the 
combined effect of the collapse in oil prices and
 economic sanctions, which exacerbated pre-existing 
structural weaknesses. Some stabilisation is expected to follow in 2016 on the back of base effects and a 

slight pick-up in oil price. 
Other non-EU Countries, Russian Federation 
  147 strategy" (including measures such as preference 
to domestic goods in public procurement and 

support to SMEs and the automotive industry). 
Negative effects on a so far tight labour market A contraction of employment is expected in both 

2015 and 2016 as a result of the recession and the 

decline in working age population. Similarly, 

unemployment is set to increase in 2015 and, to a 

lesser extent, in 2016. Nonetheless, employment 

losses will remain relatively contained overall, as 

the Russian labour market is very tight and tends 

to adjust mainly through wages. 
Surge in inflation followed by moderation later 
in the year Despite some recovery since February 2015, the 
value of the rouble remains 40% below the mid-

2014 level. The depreciation (and restrictions in 

food imports) resulted in a sharp pick-up of 

inflation from 7.8% in June 2014 to 16.9% in 

March 2015. However, as suggested by falling 

month-on-month rates since January, inflation 

appears to have peaked and is set to moderate in 

the coming months, resulting in an average annual 
rate of 12.5% in 2015. Further slow-down to 8% in 
2016 is projected on the back of base effects and a 

still weak economic environment. 
Sharp monetary tightening throughout 2014, with 
the aim of fighting inflation and stem market 

turbulence, (albeit tempered by liquidity provision 

and support to the banki
ng sector in December 
2014) was followed by two consecutive cuts of the 

key policy rate in early 2015 (by a total of 

300 bps.) based on the rouble stabilisation and the 

tilting of the balance of risks towards the economic 

slow-down. 
A worsening fiscal outlook Despite recent budget revisions including spending 

cuts, the general government balance is set to 

sharply deteriorate in 201
5, due to the recession 
and the recently adopted anti-crisis plan, and to 

remain negative in 2016. Capital injections to 

ailing banks and corporates should weigh on 

public finances (e.g. the bank recapitalisation 

scheme funded by federal bonds included in the 

anti-crisis plan), although a part could be 

accommodated by tapping existing fiscal buffers.

Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Data for 2015 and 2016 are forecasts. The source for all tables is the 
European Commission, unless otherwise stated. Historical data for 
the Member States are based on the European System of Accounts 

(ESA 2010). US national accounts are based on SNA 2008, whilst the 

Japanese accounts use SNA 1993.
All countries in that region except Japan and  the Asian 
MENA countries.

   Sub-Saharan Africa : 
The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG 
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-fledged 

economic forecasts in winter, spring and autumn. These forecasts 

cover the principal macroeconomic aggregates for the Member 

States, the candidate countries, the European Union as a whole, the 
euro area, and the international environment.
the aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange 
rates. Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area 

"adjusted" balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-

à-vis third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of 

the individual countries in the EU or  the euro area. However, intra-EU 
or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of reporting 
errors. The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border 

controls and formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of 

intra-EU trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU imports are 

underestimated compared to intra-EU exports, leading to an 
overestimation of the surplus. For the past the "adjusted" balances 
are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB estimates for the euro area. For 

the future, they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of 

the discrepancies observed in 2013.

In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for 
USA and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 

1996.
Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively, 
present data including inventories.

countries.

of payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences 

and revision schedules.

EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. 
World GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS).

All countries in that re
gion.The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential 
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in 

the capital stock and the difference between actual 

unemployment and the NAWRU play a key role. 
  European Union :
Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on full-
time-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France, 
Italy, the Netherlands, and Austria  report FTE data. In the absence of 
FTE data, employment is based on numbers of persons. In the 

calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates, priority is given to FTE 

data, as this is regarded as more 
representative of diverse patterns 
of working time.
