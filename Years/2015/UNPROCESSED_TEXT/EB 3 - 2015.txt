 MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
SUMMARYGlobal economic activity indicators continue to suggest a steady growth momentum in early 2015. 
In particular, activity remains solid in both the United States, despite signs of temporary weakness at 

the start of the year, and the United Kingdom. At the same time, the recovery remains tepid in Japan. 

Weakening growth in China has led to the implementation of stimulus measures. Decreasing import 

volumes in emerging markets constitute renewed signs of a softening in global trade. Low energy 

prices have lowered global headline inflation rates. 
Developments in euro area financial markets in March were influenced above all by the start 
 of the Eurosystem™s purchases of euro-denominated public sector securities on 9 March. 
Government bond yields declined further across maturities and most countries. The valuation 
 of stocks and other types of asset increased notably.In the euro area the latest economic indicators and survey results are consistent with continued 
economic expansion in the first quarter of 2015. Looking beyond the short term, the monetary 

policy measures taken recently by the Governing Council, the low oil price and the depreciation 

of the euro should help broaden and gradually strengthen the recovery. At the same time, although 
labour markets have shown some further signs of improvement, unemployment remains high and 

economic slack is expected to diminish only gradually.Annual euro area HICP inflation was -0.1% in March, after a low of -0.6% in January and -0.3% 
in February. On the basis of current information, inflation is expected to stay very low or negative 

in the coming months, before starting to increase gradually later in 2015. The gradual increase 

should be supported by the favourable impact of the ECB™s monetary policy measures on aggregate 

demand, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption embedded in futures 

markets of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead. Monetary analysis indicates that the annual growth of M3 has recovered further. Moreover, 
 the decline in loans to non-financial corporations has continued to moderate, while the annual rate 
of growth of loans to households has stabilised at a slightly positive level. The ECB™s monetary 

policy measures are helping to restore the proper functioning of the monetary policy transmission 
mechanism and to ease bank lending conditions. Bank funding costs and lending rates have 
declined further, and the most recent euro area bank lending survey points to further easing of 

credit standards.Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses and in line with its forward guidance, the Governing Council decided at its meeting on 15 April 2015 to keep the
 key ECB interest 
rates unchanged. Looking ahead, the Governing Council™s focus will be on the full implementation 

of the monetary policy measures it has taken. These measures will contribute to a further 

improvement in the economic outlook, a reduction in economic slack and a recovery in money 

and credit growth. Together, such developments will lead to a sustained return of inflation towards 

a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and will underpin the firm anchoring of 

medium to long-term inflation expectations.6ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 3 / 20151 E
XTERNAL ENVIRONMENTNotwithstanding some softening in activity towards the end of 2014, latest surveys continue to 
suggest steady global growth in early 2015. The global composite output PMI increased further 

in March, pointing to sustained growth in global GDP. In quarterly terms, the index recorded a 

slight rise in the first quarter of 2015 relative to the previous quarter (see Chart
 1), returning to its 
long-term average. Developments were mixed across advanced economies in the first quarter, with 

increases in the United States and the United Kingdom, but a decline in Japan. Turning to emerging 

market economies (EMEs), PMIs increased further in India and rebounded in Brazil, while they 

remained broadly unchanged in China and continued to decline in Russia. Global trade has shown signs of softening again recently.
 The volume of world merchandise 
imports increased by only 0.2% in January on a three-month-on-three-month basis, down from 
1.4% in December. This decline in momentum was driven by falling import volumes in emerging 

markets, in particular in China, which might be partly related to the timing of the Chinese New 

Year. However, the pace of growth in imports among advanced economies continued to increase 
overall, and the global PMI for new export orders remained stable in the first quarter of 2015, 

suggesting a steady momentum in world trade growth. Low energy prices are weighing on global headline inflation rates. 
Annual inflation in OECD countries remained low in February at 0.6%, as the annual rate of growth in energy prices remained 

negative (see
 Chart 2). Excluding food and energy, annual inflation in OECD countries declined 

only marginally to 1.7%. By contrast, consumer price inflation among major non-OECD countries 

rose in February and March, picking up slightly in China on the back of rising food prices and 
increasing further in Brazil and Russia owing to administered price increases and the impact of the 

depreciation of the rouble and the food embargo respectively.Chart 1 Global composite output PMI

 Real GDP grew by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the fourth 

quarter of 2014, down from 1.2% in the previous quarter, largely reflecting a negative contribution 

from net trade. Recent indicators suggest a slight but transitory slowdown in the first quarter of 

2015, mainly owing to cold weather and port disruptions. However, consumption remains sound, 

supported by lower oil prices, strengthened household balance sheets and improved consumer 

confidence. The underlying labour market momentum also remains robust, notwithstanding a 

slowdown in job creation in March. At the same time inflation stayed low, reflecting low oil prices 

and the appreciation of the US dollar. Annual headline CPI was flat in February, after having fallen 

slightly into negative territory in January owing to lower energy and import prices. Excluding food 

and energy, inflation picked up slightly, driven mainly by higher prices for services. The recovery remains tepid in Japan, while inflation continues to fall.
 After the return to positive growth at the end of 2014, the pace of growth in the Japanese economy was muted at the 
start of 2015. Both industrial production and real exports of goods improved up to February, but 
real imports of goods have also picked up significantly (see Box 1). Available monthly indicators 

for private consumption have remained weak overall, while the Bank of Japan™s Tankan survey 

for March 2015 only signalled an improvement in business confidence among non-manufacturing 

firms compared with December 2014. Meanwhile, after a brief pause at the turn of the year, the 

annual headline inflation rate slowed in February to 2.2%, largely on account of falling energy 

prices. Excluding the estimated direct impact of the VAT hike in April 2014, annual headline 

inflation stood at 0.1%, and core inflation (excluding food and energy) stood at 0.3% in February.In the United Kingdom, available indicators suggest that economic growth continued to be robust at the turn of the year. 
Real GDP increased by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the last quarter 

of 2014, driven mainly by net exports, and domestic demand is expected to sustain growth in the 

course of 2015. Although private and public sector balance sheet adjustments are still expected to 
weigh on growth, it is likely that the marked decline in energy prices will support real disposable 

income and economic activity. The unemployment rate stabilised at 5.7% in the three months to 

January 2015. Annual CPI inflation declined to 0% in February 2015 owing to the fall in energy 

prices. This was the lowest level of headline inflation since the introduction of the CPI index in 

1989. CPI inflation excluding unprocessed food and energy fell marginally to 1.1%.In China, stimulus measures have been introduced to counter weaker growth. A wide range of indicators, including industrial production, retail sales and manufacturing PMI, point towards a 

slowdown in GDP growth at the start of 2015. At the same time housing activity remained weak, and 

property prices continued to decline. Against this backdrop, China introduced measures to stimulate 

the housing market by increasing the ceilings on mortgage loan-to-value ratios and reducing the 

minimum ownership period for tax benefits. These measures are an attempt to halt the slowdown in 

economic activity by boosting household demand for housing and increasing consumption.The economy remains depressed in Russia, with offsetting forces shaping the outlook.
 Economic activity is expected to contract significantly in 2015 on the back of the fall in oil prices, 

economic sanctions and the recent turmoil in financial markets. The revised budget passed by the 

Parliament in April foresees cuts in government expenditure in 2015, which along with a significant 

fall in revenues, would result in a budget deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 2015. The Central Bank of 

Russia continued to ease its monetary stance in March, lowering the policy rate by further 100 basis 
8ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 3 / 2015points to 14%. Money market liquidity conditions have started to normalise, although financing 
costs for the banking system remain elevated. The recent appreciation of the rouble will help to ease 

inflationary pressures, but might negatively affect exports proceeds and reduce budget revenues.2 FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSInterest rates in the euro area reached new historic lows after the Eurosystem started its 

purchases under the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) on 9 March. 
Interest rates 
decreased significantly across maturities in most countries during the first few days of purchases 

(see Chart 3). Over the review period - 5 March to 14 April - all countries (except Greece) recorded 
declining sovereign bond yields, with the largest declines observed in the highest rated countries. 

The average yield on ten-year euro area sovereign bonds declined by 14 basis points to stand at 

around 0.8% at the end of the review period. Large declines in the longer maturities led to a further 

flattening of sovereign yield curves throughout the euro area. At the short end an increasing number 

of euro area countries recorded negative yields. The continued uncertainty surrounding Greece™s 

access to finance led to significant volatility in Greek sovereign bond yields, but has not thus far 

had a negative impact on financing conditions in other countries.EONIA forward rates also decreased significantly after the first PSPP purchases. During the review period the EONIA stood at -6 basis points, on average, and traded predominantly within 

a narrow band between -4 and -9 basis points. The EONIA forward rates decreased further over 

the review period, so that the money market yield curve flattened, especially in the case of longer 

maturities (see Chart 4). This mainly reflected expectations of higher future excess liquidity as a 

result of the PSPP purchases. Moreover, the •97.8 billion take-up in the third targeted longer

excess liquidity. The take-up was higher than expected by market participants, which exerted some 

downward pressure on EONIA forward rates over the maturity horizon of the TLTROs (2018).European stock markets continued to outperform their US peers. From 5 March to 14 April, the broad-based Euro Stoxx equity price index increased by around 6%, while the US Standard 

and Poor™s 500 equity price index was unchanged. The persistently good performance of European 

stock markets was supported by declining bond yields, which lowered the equity discount factor 

(comprising the lower risk-free rate and the equity risk premium) and possibly also increased 
expectations for future earnings. Stock price increases were higher in the financial sector than in 

the non-financial sector. Shares of corporations in the financial sector rose by slightly less than 8% 

over the review period while those in the non-financial sector only increased by around 5%.The exchange rate of the euro continued to depreciate amid expectations of a protracted 
divergence of monetary policy in the euro area and other jurisdictions. 
The euro has weakened 
by 3.7% in trade-weighted terms over the review period. The euro depreciated broadly vis-à-vis 

most major currencies in early March, reaching a twelve-year low both in effective terms and vis-

à-vis the US dollar in the middle of the month. Thereafter, the euro recovered some of its losses 

on account of new releases of macroeconomic data for the euro area and other major economies. 

In early April, however, the euro weakened further to new historical lows on account of market 

expectations of a sustained divergence of monetary policy in the euro area and other jurisdictions. 

The euro depreciation was broad-based. Indeed, the euro also weakened vis-à-vis the Japanese 

yen, the pound sterling and the currencies of other EU countries, as well as the currencies of most 

emerging economies Œ in particular the Russian rouble, which recovered from its earlier sharp 

depreciation Œ and commodity-exporting countries.3 E
CONOMIC ACTIVITYQuarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the euro area was confirmed at 0.3% in the last 

quarter of 2014.
 Domestic demand, notably private consumption, as well as net exports contributed 

positively to growth, while inventory developments had a negative impact. While output has been 

growing in recent quarters (see Chart 5), and the unemployment rate has declined after reaching a 

peak in 2013, there is still considerable slack in the economy. The latest hard data are consistent with continued economic expansion in the first quarter of this year. Industrial production excluding construction increased by 1.1%, month on month, in 

February and stood as a result in the first two months of 2015 0.7% above its average level in the 
final quarter of last year. Similarly, in January construction production stood 2% above its level 

in the fourth quarter. Recent developments in capital goods production point to a further rise in 

euro area investment in the first quarter, while retail trade and car registrations are in line with a 

continued robust increase in private consumption (see also Box 2 on the consumption of durable 
goods). These developments are encouraging overall, given the prominent role domestic demand is 

considered to play in the recovery.More timely survey data point to a firming economic recovery in the period ahead.
 The composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) and the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) 

improved between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year (see Chart 5). 
10ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 3 / 2015During the first quarter both indicators stood on average above their respective long-term averages, 
suggesting that the recovery is gaining momentum. Moreover, another marked increase in consumer 

confidence levels in the euro area was recorded between February and March. The consumer 

confidence index, which now stands well above its long-term average, has over the last four months 

more than recouped the fall recorded over the summer and autumn of last year, reaching a level 

not seen since autumn 2007 (see also Box 3). In addition, the most recent bank lending survey 

shows that credit supply constraints eased further in the first quarter of this year, which should 

support the economic recovery. Survey data on export developments, covering the full first quarter, 

paint a somewhat more optimistic picture than the hard data on trade. For instance, the PMI survey 

shows that new export orders rose between the last quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of this year, 

reaching a level above the long-term average. Labour markets, although still weak, are improving. Employment increased further by 0.1%, 
quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2014 (see Chart 6). As a result, employment stood 0.9% 

above the level recorded one year earlier, representing its highest annual increase since the second 

quarter of 2008. The unemployment rate for the euro area, which started to decline in mid-2013, 

declined further in February, reaching 11.3%. More timely information gained from survey results 

points to labour markets improving at a somewhat faster pace in the period ahead.Looking beyond the short term, the recent fall in oil prices should support economic growth, 
particularly domestic demand, via gains in the real disposable income of households as well 

as corporate profits
. Domestic demand should be further supported by ongoing improvements 

in financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural 

reforms. Furthermore, demand for euro area exports should benefit from the expected global 

recovery and from improvements in price competitiveness. However, the euro area recovery

sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The results from the latest 

ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (see http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/indic/forecast/

html/index.en.html) show that private sector GDP growth forecasts have been revised up for 2015, 

by 0.3 percentage point to 1.4%, compared with the previous round, and for 2016 by 0.2 percentage 

point, to 1.7%. At the same time, unemployment rate expectations were revised down, for both 

2015 and 2016. 4 P
RICES AND COSTSInflation in the euro area has remained negative in recent months, but is on an upward 

trajectory. According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area HICP inflation increased to -0.1% 
in March 2015, from -0.3% in February and -0.6% in January (see Chart 7). This upturn reflects 

the much less negative annual growth rate of energy prices owing to the increase in oil prices in 

euro terms seen since mid-January. In contrast to headline inflation, the HICP excluding food and 

energy (which recorded an annual rate of change of 0.6% in March) continues to hover within the 

range of 0.6% to 1.0% recorded since late 2013. The turnaround in inflationary pressures is slowly becoming visible in other incoming data.
 Data from the Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) survey on input and output prices and from 

the European Commission survey on selling price expectations indicate that prices rebounded in 

February 2015 and stabilised in March in all sectors. In addition, according to the latest available 
breakdown of HICP data, the share of items 

recording negative or very low inflation rates 

declined in February for both headline HICP 

inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy 

and food after reaching a peak in January.Pipeline price pressures continue to be weak, 
but the recent depreciation of the euro has 

exerted some upward pressure. The annual rate 

of industrial producer price inflation excluding 

construction and energy declined slightly further 

in February 2015, but that in producer price 

inflation for non-food consumer goods halted 

its recent decline (standing at -0.1%), and that 

in producer price inflation for consumer food 

increased to -1.3% in February, from -1.5% in 

January. This points to a possible turning point 

in the dynamics of those producer prices that 

are closely linked to consumer goods prices in 

the HICP. Inflation in the goods component 

of the HICP also reflects the pass-through of 

developments in prices of imported goods, and 

the annual rate of change in import prices for 

non-food consumer goods increased further in 

January, reflecting the depreciation of the euro.

Issue 3 / 2015The latest data on labour costs and profit 
margins continue to suggest moderate 
domestic price pressures for the time being. 
From the third to the fourth quarter of 2014, 

euro area annual wage growth increased slightly 

from 1.2% to 1.3%, when measured in terms of 

compensation per employee, while it decreased 

from 1.3% to 1.1% when measured in terms 

of hours worked. The slight increase in annual 

growth in compensation per employee was 

mainly accounted for by a stronger contribution 

from the industry sector (see Chart 8). As 
labour productivity growth continued to 

decline, growth in unit labour costs increased 

marginally. Profit growth (measured in terms 

of gross operating surplus) weakened in the 

fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting a slowdown in 

the rate of growth in profits per unit of output 
(a measure of profit margins) that offset the 

impact of the ongoing strengthening in real 

GDP growth. From a sectoral perspective, 

profit growth edged into negative territory in 

the industrial sector, while it increased slightly 

in the market services sector. The GDP deflator, 

which is indicative of domestic inflationary 

pressures, declined to 0.9% in the fourth quarter, from 1.0% in the previous quarter, reflecting the 

subdued developments in unit labour costs and profit margins. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation 
is expected to remain very low in the months ahead before increasing again.
 Supported by the 

favourable impact of the recent monetary policy measures on aggregate demand, the impact of the 

lower euro exchange rate and the assumption embedded in oil futures markets of somewhat higher 

oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to increase later in 2015 and to pick up 

further during 2016 and 2017. The results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF)  

for the second quarter of 2015 imply average inflation expectations of 0.1%, 1.2% and 1.6% for 

2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively (see the survey at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/indic/

forecast/html/index.en.html). Compared with the previous SPF round, inflation expectations were 

revised downwards by 0.2 percentage point for 2015 and upwards by 0.1 percentage point for both 

2016 and 2017. Since mid-January 2015 both market-based and survey-based measures of longer-

term inflation expectations have recovered from low levels (see Box 4). According to the SPF, the 

average inflation expectations for 2019 were 1.8%.Turning to house price developments, annual growth in the ECB™s residential property 
price indicator for the euro area increased further to 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 
The recovery in house prices continued at a moderate pace but major differences in the magnitude of 
growth persisted across euro area countries. Euro area house price growth is expected to strengthen 

further in the period ahead, reflecting expectations of strengthening income growth, favourable 

financing conditions and corrections of earlier misalignments of house prices in recent years.Chart 8 Compensation per employee by

ONEY AND CREDITMonetary dynamics have strengthened further. The annual growth rate of M3 increased to 4.0% in February, compared with 3.7% in January (see Chart 9).
1 The pick-up in M3 growth continues to 
reflect high inflows into overnight deposits held by both households and non-financial corporations 

(NFCs). The narrow monetary aggregate M1 has continued its robust expansion. The annual 

growth rate of M1 increased to 9.1% in February,
 thus pointing to the continuation of the economic 
recovery in the euro area.In an environment of very low interest rates, the most liquid components of M3 become more attractive. The low remuneration of monetary assets encourages money holders to prefer overnight 
deposits to other deposits or marketable instruments within M3, as the non-pecuniary liquidity 

services they provide outweigh the return differential vis-à-vis other short-term investments. Indeed, 

recent data show that other short-term deposits have continued to contract, despite the low interest 

rates. Marketable instruments have started to recover, recording sizeable inflows in February.Portfolio substitution has supported broad money growth. 
While some investors have moved 
from less liquid deposits included in M3 towards riskier assets outside M3, other investors have 
shifted away from longer-term MFI financial liabilities, thereby supporting M3 growth. Indeed, an 

assessment of the contribution to M3 growth made by its counterparts shows that over recent months 

its dynamics have been mainly driven by shifts away from longer-term MFI financial liabilities to 

shorter-term instruments included in M3. The annual rate of change in longer-term MFI financial 

liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) held by the money-holding sector stood at -5.7% in 

February. The support from net external assets 

to M3 growth is moderating. Relative to its 

historic peak in mid-2014, the contribution 

from the MFI sector™s net external asset position 

decreased further in February. In the 12-month 

period to February 2015, the inflow into MFIs™ 

net external assets was •149 billion, compared 

with a historical peak of •412 billion in the 

12-month period to July 2014. While the surplus 

in the current account of the balance of payments 

continues to be a positive factor, sizeable net 

redemptions by foreigners of securities issued by 

euro area residents exerted a negative effect in 

the 12-month period to February 2015. 
The continuation of the recovery in loan 
dynamics is providing further support for 

M3 growth.
 The annual growth rate of MFI 

loans to the private sector increased from 0.4% 

in January to 0.6% in February (see Chart 9). 
The gradual improvement in credit dynamics 

was visible across households and firms.  The annual rate of change in MFI loans to

and securitisation) increased further and stood 

at -0.4% in February (compared with -0.9% 

in January). The annual growth of loans to 

households increased marginally, to 1.0%, in 

February (compared with 0.9% in January), 

thus exceeding the average of 0.5% observed 

since summer 2012, when the ECB signalled 

its readiness to act decisively. Despite these 

positive trends, the consolidation of bank 

balance sheets and further deleveraging 

needs in some economic sectors and banking 

jurisdictions continue to curb credit dynamics.Bank lending rates have declined further 
(see Chart 10). The ECB™s accommodative 

monetary policy stance, a strengthened balance 

sheet situation and receding fragmentation in 

financial markets in general have led to a further 

decline in banks™ composite funding costs, which 

have stabilised close to historically low levels. 

The decline in the cost of deposit funding for euro 

area banks was widespread across countries in February. MFI net issuance of debt securities remained 

negative. The ongoing contraction of balance sheets and strengthening of banks™ capital base is reducing 

the need for banks to seek funding via debt securities issuance. Partly as a consequence of a quicker and 

more intense pass-through from banks™ funding costs to bank lending conditions, the overall nominal 

cost of external financing for euro area NFCs declined in the fourth quarter of 2014 and at the beginning 

of 2015. Rates on loans to NFCs declined further in February, in particular in the case of short-term 

loans (the composite bank lending rates for euro area NFCs fell to 2.34% in February, compared with 

2.80% in June 2014). Rates on loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged 

in February (the composite bank lending rates for households for house purchase stood at 2.38%). 
 In February, the decrease in the nominal cost of external financing was mostly explained by a fall in the 

cost of equity and to a lesser extent by a decline in the cost of market-based debt.The April 2015 euro area bank lending survey points to further improvements in lending 
conditions (see survey at: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/surveys/lend/html/index.
en.html). Banks continued to ease credit standards for loans to non-financial corporations (in net 

terms) in the first quarter of 2015, while for loans to households the picture was mixed. However, 
from a historical perspective credit standards still remain tight. The net easing for NFCs was driven 

by the decline in the cost of bank funds and improved MFI balance sheet conditions as well as 

stronger competitive pressures among banks. The survey also shows that additional liquidity from 

the asset purchase programme (APP) is being used by banks in particular for granting loans. The 

APP is giving rise to declining net interest rate margins, which tend to lower banks™ profitability. 

However, banks™ capital gains from the government bond sales are expected to exert a positive 

impact on profitability in the shorter term. In addition, the targeted longer-term refinancing 

operations (TLTROs) are contributing to a narrowing of lending margins. The survey points to a 

pick-up in demand for loans to non-financial corporations, for housing loans to households and for 

consumer credit. In this context, the low general level of interest rates has been an important driver 

of demand for loans to both firms and households.Chart 10 Composite bank lending rates

the economy. Even before the election of the new government under Prime Minister Abe 

in November
 2012, financial markets had anticipated a significant policy change. One 
consequence was a sharp depreciation of the Japanese yen, which has fallen by 30% in 

nominal effective terms since September 2012 (see Chart A). This gave rise to the expectation 

that the Japanese economy would get a particular boost through higher (net) exports, as the 

weaker yen increased the price competitiveness of Japanese products abroad, while increasing 

the price of foreign goods in Japan. Yet, over the past two and half years, real export growth 

in Japan has been rather weak, while real import dynamics have been relatively robust. Since 

late 2012, the contribution of net trade to GDP growth has been, on average, virtually null1. This box discusses the factors behind recent developments in Japan™s net exports. It notes 

that the exchange rate is only one variable affecting net export performance and finds that 

relatively sluggish demand for Japan™s exports and, to a lesser extent, increased demand for 

(imported) natural gas following the 2011 earthquake also play an important role in explaining 

recent developments. Overall, taking these influences into consideration, developments in 

exports and imports have been broadly in line with fundamentals.1 The average contribution of net trade excludes the data in the first quarter of 2014 as the official export and import series are distorted

Issue 3 / 2015Since late 2012 average export growth in 
Japan has been rather modest. While export 

growth picked up sharply at the start of the 

yen™s depreciation, the expansion stalled in the 

following four quarters, recovering only in the 

second half of last year (see Chart B). Looking 

past the volatility, average quarterly growth since 

the fourth quarter of 2012 has been 1%.2 While 
this is in line with average growth since 2000, 

it is weaker than that experienced during earlier 

episodes of sharp yen depreciation.The main factor behind this modest export growth has been weaker than expected 

external demand.
 Foreign demand has been 
particularly weak in the last two years, in 

part reflecting the broad weakness in global 

trade since 2011. But Japan has suffered, in 
particular, from slowing growth in its main 

export markets, especially China and the 

rest of emerging Asia, where import growth 

since 2012 has been well below past averages 
(see Chart C). At the same time, Japan has 

continued to suffer from a decline in its export 

market share, which may be partly related 
to the long-standing trend in Japan to shift 
production overseas (see Chart D), with 

firms increasingly serving demand through 

foreign subsidiaries.Nevertheless, Japanese exports have still reaped some benefits from the yen™s 

sharp depreciation through the associated 

improvement in price competitiveness, 

which has partially offset the weakness 

in foreign demand.
 The nominal effective 
exchange rate of the yen has declined by
 30% 
since the peak in the third quarter of
 2012. At 
the same time, taking into account movements 

in export prices in other countries, Japan™s 
relative export price has declined by
 13% 
since 2012, meaning that Japan has witnessed a 

sizeable improvement in price competitiveness 

(see Chart A). That, in turn, supported 

export growth. As Japanese exporters

increase in export prices in yen, thereby boosting exporters™ profits. That also helped Japanese 

exporters to reverse some of the margin compression suffered when the yen had appreciated 
substantially after the financial crisis. The recent pass-through of exchange rate changes to export prices is broadly consistent 
with past experience. Estimates in the literature suggest that the pass-through from the exchange 
rate depreciation to Japan™s export price in importers™ currencies is typically less than one, 

suggesting that some exporters are ﬁpricing to marketﬂ. This may be related to Japan™s invoicing 

practice; compared with other advanced economies, Japan invoices only a small proportion of its 

exports in its own currency.Robust import growth has also weighed on the contribution of net exports to GDP growth
. Since early
 2013 imports have expanded, on average, by
 1.5% quarter-on-quarter Œ stronger than 
the average pace of growth since 2000. The recent period of yen depreciation has been marked 

by considerable volatility, mostly reflecting the front-loading of demand prior to the VAT hike 

of April 2014, when imports increased sharply. Having fallen in the following quarters, import 

growth resumed towards the end of last year, more in line with historical averages (see
 Chart E). 
The path of import growth has been shaped mostly by changes in final demand, with price 
changes playing a comparatively modest role. In Japan, import dynamics have typically been 

relatively price-insensitive, with low long-term price elasticity. This, in turn, implies that 

although the depreciation of the yen led to an increase in the relative prices of imported goods 

vis-à-vis domestically produced goods, it created only a marginal headwind for import growth 

in recent quarters. This may reflect the high share of commodity imports, for which demand is 

typically less sensitive to price changes. Moreover, Japan™s demand for energy imports has been

 2011 Fukushima disaster, which forced Japanese power generators to switch swiftly to (mostly imported) fossil fuels. Since then, the volume of natural gas imports 
has increased by around 40% (see Chart F).Overall, developments in exports and imports have been broadly in line with fundamentals. 
Recent export growth has indeed been rather modest given the yen™s depreciation, but the main 

factor behind this weakness is sluggish external demand, particularly from China and emerging 

Asia Œ Japan™s main export markets. Japanese exports have benefited from improved price 
competitiveness, with the recent pass-through of exchange rate changes to export prices broadly 

consistent with past experience. By contrast, import growth has been relatively robust since 

the yen depreciated, mostly driven by strong domestic demand, particularly ahead of the VAT 

increase. The higher volume of imports also reflects the increased demand for (imported) natural 

gas following the 2011 Fukushima disaster. 19ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 3 / 2015Box˜2RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CONSUMPTION OF DURABLE GOODSConsumption of durable goods in the euro area has recently exhibited vigorous growth.1 In 2014 the average annual growth in consumption expenditure on durable goods in the euro area was similar to pre-financial crisis rates (see Chart A). This recovery is largely explained 
by the solid positive contribution of durable goods other than cars. Car sales also contributed to 
some extent to the recovery, showing a sizeable increase in comparison with 2013. However, it 
should be noted that the underlying trends in car sales are more difficult to identify as they have 
been strongly influenced by various temporary national measures in recent years. Meanwhile, 

the improvement in durable goods consumption since 2013 was not confined to a few countries 
but was widespread across the euro area, pointing to a broad-based recovery in durables 
spending (see Chart B).1 See also the box entitled ﬁRecent developments in the consumption of durable goods in the euro areaﬂ,

Issue 3 / 2015Consumption of durable goods is typically more sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
than consumption of non-durables and services.
 Changes in economic conditions may include unexpected changes in income or in financing conditions, higher macroeconomic uncertainty or 

changes in price expectations. The consumption of durable goods is typically more sensitive to 

such changes because durable goods have a long life cycle and high price per item, which means 

that their purchase might be postponed. Thus, while consumption of durable goods represents a 
relatively small share of total private consumption, around
 9% in the euro area, it can serve as an 
important indicator of households™ perceptions of economic conditions.The current widespread recovery in durables consumption is supported by the reversal of 
past headwinds, despite some remaining dampening factors. Over the period from 2012 to 

around mid-2013, concerns in some countries about debt sustainability, rising unemployment, 

weak developments in real disposable income and household wealth, household deleveraging 

pressures, as well as heightened uncertainty and low consumer confidence, were the main 

factors behind the negative evolution of expenditure on durable goods. These headwinds 

have largely disappeared and, in some cases, have even reversed. In particular, the very 

accommodative monetary policy stance, the lower oil prices, as well as improving labour 

market conditions and the slowdown in the pace of fiscal consolidation, have led to a recovery 

in households™ real disposable income and easing financing conditions. Some special factors 

may have also played a role. For example, the strong gains in car sales recently recorded in 
Spain were in part related to the government 

extending its car scrappage programme (Plan 

PIVE). The recovery in consumption of 

durable goods other than cars (e.g. household 

appliances and furniture) may also be 

evidence of improvements in the residential 

construction sector. Reflecting improving 

economic conditions, consumer confidence 

and, in particular, households™ expectations 

about unemployment and their financial 

situation have improved markedly since 2013 

(see Chart
 C).2 Furthermore, consumers 
may now need to replace durable goods that 

depreciated during the recent episode of very 

high uncertainty and rising unemployment. 

Nevertheless, high household indebtedness 

and the lower, but still sizeable, level of 

uncertainty about the economic outlook 

may continue to have a dampening effect on 

purchases of ﬁbig-ticketﬂ items.Looking ahead, the survey indicators of consumers™ intentions to make major 

purchases have been strengthening. The indicators of current and future intentions

euro area. The indicator of present intentions 

currently stands at its pre-financial crisis 

values (see Chart D). The indicator of future 

intentions (purchases in the next
 12 months)  

has improved significantly over recent months, 

albeit while remaining at levels far below its 
 long-term average. Overall, despite the low inflation 
environment, there is no evidence of 

consumers currently postponing purchases 

of durable goods. Such a postponement 

is one of the channels through which 

negative inflation or deflation might have 

an adverse effect on economic growth, in 

particular in the presence of a zero lower 

bound on interest rates. When consumers 

expect lower prices in the future, they may 

delay purchases of less essential and more 

expensive durable goods. This channel has 

found some empirical support in studies 

of deflationary or low inflation episodes.3  By contrast, recent data for the euro area 
suggest that the boost to households™ real 

income provided by lower inflation is translating into higher consumption, including of 

durable goods, thereby supporting the economic recovery.3 See, for example, Cargill, T.F. and Parker, E., ﬁPrice deflation and consumption: central bank policy and Japan™s economic and

Issue 3 / 2015Box 3WHAT HAS BEEN DRIVING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE?Euro area consumer confidence increased sharply in March 2015 for the fourth consecutive 
month to reach pre-crisis levels. This constituted a recovery from the drop in confidence 

recorded in the second half of 2014. Overall, the trend has been for growing consumer 

confidence since early 2013. This box takes a closer look at recent developments in consumer 

confidence and examines to what extent lower oil prices and lower unemployment have been 
 driving this indicator.The most recent rise in consumer confidence coincided with a gradual recovery in the 
labour market and lower oil prices.
 Notwithstanding a dip in the second half of 2014, euro 
area labour markets have been improving steadily since late 2012, which might have played a 

role in supporting consumer confidence (see Chart A). Furthermore, oil prices fell sharply in 

the second half of 2014 and have remained at low levels since then, boosting consumers™ real 

disposable income and possibly also consumer confidence (see Chart B). Even though it waned 

somewhat during that period, available evidence suggests that consumer confidence typically 

reacts positively to lower oil prices.1 1 For evidence from the United States on the reaction of consumer confidence to energy-related increases in real disposable income, 
see Edelstein, P. and Kilian, L., ﬁHow sensitive are consumer expenditures to retail energy prices?ﬂ, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 56, 2009, pp. 766-779. For more recent evidence on the impact of lower oil prices on US consumer confidence, see Aladangady

significantly more positive assessment by households of future unemployment and the 
 future general economic situation.
2 By contrast, households™ assessment of their future savings 
and financial situation contributed only marginally (see Chart C). This suggests that labour market 

developments must have been a determining factor in recent improvements in consumer confidence. 

Households™ assessments of the general economic situation are also highly correlated with their 

expectations of unemployment, suggesting that a larger share of total consumer confidence could 

eventually be explained by labour market developments. Nevertheless, it is important to note that 

although declining, the unemployment rate is still high in many euro area countries. 
The increase in euro area consumer confidence was driven mainly by Germany, as well as 

Spain and Italy. In the latter two countries, the improvement in consumer confidence coincided with 

a decline in the unemployment rate. In Germany too, favourable labour market conditions, including a 

low and further declining unemployment rate, have been boosting consumer confidence. By contrast, 

consumer confidence in France has changed less over the past two years, in line with labour market 

developments. Moreover, owing to the lower weight of petroleum products in French consumption, 

the drop in oil prices has had a relatively lower direct impact on real disposable income, which might 

to some extent also explain the smaller improvement in French consumer confidence (see Chart D).Econometric evidence confirms that increased consumer confidence in the euro area since 

early 2013 has been driven chiefly by improving labour market dynamics. At the same time 

lower energy prices have also to some extent contributed to the rise in consumer confidence. 

In the last quarter of 2014 increasing employment growth and lower oil prices have driven

Issue 3 / 2015up growth in households™ real disposable income to a level not seen since before the crisis. 
 Even though some of the improvement in the labour market could also be related to lower energy 
prices, econometric evidence suggests that the rise in consumer confidence relates mainly to a 

genuine improvement in the labour market that is unrelated to lower oil prices. The renewed 

improvements in the labour market over the past few months are therefore an encouraging 

sign, as they should result in a more sustained and persistent recovery in consumer confidence, 
compared with a temporary increase in consumer confidence in response to lower oil prices.25ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 3 / 2015Box 4DEVELOPMENTS IN LONGER-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS IN THE EURO AREAAfter having reached low levels in mid-January, longer-term inflation expectations in the 
euro area have recovered. The decline observed over the previous two years has thus come to 
a halt. These movements Œ with some differences Œ were also observed in the United States and 

the United Kingdom. Longer-term inflation expectations are generally seen to be an indicator 

of the credibility of central banks in achieving their price stability objectives and should, 

therefore, remain solidly ﬁanchoredﬂ. The anchoring of inflation expectations requires longer-

term expectations not to respond to changes in shorter-term inflation developments. Against this 

background, the box reviews past developments of longer-term inflation expectations, comparing 

them on the basis of market-based and survey-based indicators. Both market-based and, albeit to a lesser extent, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations declined between early 2013 and early 2015. 
Expectations of inflation 

five years ahead, as expressed in the ECB™s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), fell from 

1.98% in the first quarter of 2013 to 1.77% in the first quarter of 2015 (see Chart A). The one-year 

forward inflation rate four years ahead derived 
from market-based measures decreased from 

2.0% in early 2013 to 1.2% in January 2015, 

while the five-year inflation-linked swap rate 

five years ahead fell from 2.4% to 1.5% over 

the same period.1Some of the differences in the behaviour of 
market-based and survey-based measures 

of inflation expectations may stem from 

inflation risk premia. Part of the decline in 
market based measures in the euro area over the 
last two years may have reflected not only the 

downward movement in baseline expectations, 

in line with survey-based measures, but also a 

decline in inflation risk premia. In 2013 and 

2014, data releases on inflation persistently 

surprised market participants to the downside, 

which may have resulted in a more prominent 

pricing-in of downward risks to inflation and 

in low or even negative inflation risk premia.Declines in market-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations were also 

observed in other countries. Market-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
1 In evaluating the developments in market-based inflation expectations, it is crucial that the full variety of market-based indicators 
of inflation expectations is considered. The indicators derived from inflation-linked swaps are considered most reliable since they 
are less affected by seasonality and liquidity distortions than indicators derived from bonds. The latter are nonetheless crucial for 
 cross-checking the signals derived from inflation-linked swaps.Chart A Longer-term market-based and

Issue 3 / 2015also declined in the United States and the United Kingdom, although the decline in the 

euro area was more prolonged, starting in early 
2013 (see Chart B).Against this backdrop, the Governing Council announced an expanded asset 
purchase programme in January 2015.
 
Many indicators of actual and expected 

inflation in the euro area had drifted towards 

historical lows. Monetary policy measures 

were thus undertaken in order to address the 

risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation 

and potential second-round effects on wage 

and price-setting that could adversely affect 

medium-term price developments.Since January 2015, both market-based and survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations in the euro area have 

recovered from their low levels. 
After having 
declined to 1.5% in January 2015, five-year 
inflation-linked swap rates five years ahead rose to around 1.7% in mid-April, while the one-year 

forward rate four years ahead derived from market-based measures increased from 1.2% to 1.5% 

over the same period. The survey-based euro area forward inflation curve derived from the latest 

SPF (that for second quarter of 2015) moved upwards as well. In particular, the average point-

forecast for longer-term inflation expectations increased by 0.07 percentage point to 1.84%.The recovery of longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area indicates that both 
professional forecasters and market participants are now again more confident that 

inflation will return to a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Chart B Five year inflation linked swap

FEDERAL RESERVE™S LARGE-SCALE ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAMMESThe Federal Reserve System embarked on a series of large-scale asset purchase 

programmes soon after the bankruptcy of Lehman brothers.
 These quantitative easing 

programmes (commonly referred to as QE1, QE2 and QE3
1) quickly replaced the use of the 
lending facilities, which had constituted the Federal Reserve™s first reaction to the financial 

turbulence experienced from late
 2007. The last of these large-scale purchase programmes ended 
in October
 2014. This box reviews the evolution of four US money and lending-related variables 
during the implementation of these programmes: base money, broad money, lending to non-

financial corporations and credit standards applied by banks when granting loans. US broad 

money (M2) growth returned to pre-crisis levels during the implementation of QE2, outpacing 

the growth of nominal GDP. The US QE period as a whole also saw a sustained easing in bank 

credit standards and a subsequent recovery in corporate bank lending. The corresponding euro 

area variables are presented for comparison. Table A summarises each phase of asset purchasing in the United States in terms of timing, 
composition and size, as well as the changes in the Federal Reserve™s lending facilities and in 

base money. US base money is a useful indicator of the timing, pace and net size of the Federal 
Reserve™s policy interventions (see Chart A). 
By construction, central bank asset purchase 
programmes, as well as lending operations to commercial banks, result in commensurate 
1 Between September 2011 and end-2012, the Federal Reserve also engaged in the maturity extension programme (commonly referred to 
as MEP). This programme led to an extension of the average maturity of the securities in the securities portfolio of the Federal Reserve, 
which prolonged the impact of the previous purchases, but did not imply an additional increase in the Federal Reserve™s balance 

sheet or in the aggregate amount of central bank reserves held by US banks. For the exact dates of the various non-standard measures 
implemented by the Federal Reserve, as well as their impact on band markets, see Altavilla, C. and Giannone, D., ﬁThe effectiveness of 
non-standard monetary policy measures from survey dataﬂ, CEPR Discussion Papers, No 10001, 2014.Table A Timing, composition and size of the Federal Reserve™s large-scale asset purchase

1) This includes lending to depository and other financial institutions, lending through other credit facilities and support for specific institutions.28ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 3 / 2015increases in banks™ reserves held with the 
central bank, and thus in base money.
2 Indeed, the overall increase in base money 

throughout the implementation of each of 

the Federal Reserve™s purchase programmes 

broadly corresponds to the observed variation 

in the SOMA holdings plus the change in the 

use of the lending facilities (see Table A)3, and it provides concise information about 

the timing, pace and net size of each of the 

Federal Reserve™s policy interventions.There is no one-to-one relationship between base money and broad money. 
Purchases of securities by the central bank 

affect broad money both via a mechanic, 

direct effect and via a subsequent rebalancing 
of sellers™ portfolios. The direct impact on 

broad money depends on the sector to which 

the ultimate sellers belong. For instance, 

in the case of the euro area, purchases will 

result in an initial one-to-one increase in M3 

if the sellers belong to the money holding 
sector (e.g. if the sellers are households, 

non-financial corporations, financial intermediaries other than monetary financial institutions 

(MFIs) or government entities other than central government). If the sellers are MFIs or non-

euro area residents, broad money is not affected as their deposit holdings are not included in 

M3. The direct effect constitutes, however, only a first, instantaneous impact. After selling, 

most sellers will start rebalancing their portfolios. Some of the rebalancing transactions 

will result in a contraction in broad money (e.g. when a resident non-MFI entity uses the 

proceeds of its sales to acquire foreign assets or invests its proceeds in long-term debt 

securities issued by a resident MFI). Other rebalancing transactions will lead to an increase 

in broad money (e.g. when a non-resident entity acquires equity or bonds issued by a resident 
 non-financial corporation). In addition, and more generally, the overall broad money balance 

in the economy is determined by many other concomitant interactions. Among these, economic 

activity and bank lending, as the main sources of endogenous money creation, play a crucial role. 
US broad money (M2) growth returned to pre-crisis levels only during the implementation 
of QE2 in 2011. Based on the considerations of the previous paragraph, an increase in base money 

does not necessarily result in a rise in broad money. In fact, during QE1 from 2008-10 there was a 

sharp drop in broad money growth in spite of the rise in base money. First, this occurred in a deeply 

recessionary environment that led to a drastic contraction in bank lending (see Chart E). Second, 
2 This is because the central bank pays for its asset purchases by crediting the reserve accounts of its counterparties, which may act either 
as ultimate sellers or as settlement agents of another ultimate seller. In the United States, base money is defined as bank reserves with 
the central bank plus currency in circulation. For simplicity, this box uses ﬁbanksﬂ or ﬁcommercial banksﬂ as generic terminology to 
refer to depository institutions in the case of the United States and credit institutions in the case of the euro area.3 The System Open Market Account (SOMA), managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, contains dollar-denominated 

assets acquired via open market operations. The aggregated balance of the various facilities lending to US residents peaked at 
USD 1.05 trillion at end-December 2008. Chart A Base money(in trillions of the respective currency; quarterly data)0.00.5

Notes: The latest observations are for December 2014. The 

vertical lines mark the beginning of the quarter in which each 

quantitative easing programme phase starts. For the United States, 

base money comprises currency in circulation and deposits held 

by banks and other depository institutions in their accounts with 

the Federal Reserve. For the euro area, base money comprises 

banknotes and MFls™ current account and deposit facility balances.29ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 3 / 2015the bulk of the QE1 purchases consisted of 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Most of 

these securities were held by banks4, which 
reduced the direct impact of the purchases on 

broad money. Broad money growth recovered, 

however, during the implementation of QE2 

in 2011 and remained at high rates throughout 

QE3 from 2012-14 (see Chart B). Looking at 

the period from September 2012 onwards, 

US M2 growth registered an annual rate of 

between 6% and 7%. By comparison, since 

the Lehman collapse euro area annual M3 

growth has remained significantly below its 

pre-crisis level, despite a significant recovery in 

recent quarters.US broad money growth outpaced that of 
nominal GDP for most of the QE period
. 
It can be argued that the observed increase 

in broad money and loans could reflect a 

normal, endogenous reaction to the recovery 

in economic activity5. Indeed, in contrast with 
the euro area, real GDP in the United States has 

been steadily growing since the 2009 recession. 

Therefore, it is worth observing the evolution 

of the ratio of broad money to nominal GDP. 

This ratio shows that, in contrast with the 

period 2003-07, US broad money growth 

systematically exceeded that of nominal GDP 

for most of the QE period and particularly after 

the implementation of QE2 (see Chart C).As regards the impact on lending to the economy, US banks began to ease the 

standards applied to loans to non-financial 

corporations from mid-QE1 onwards, 

possibly reflecting the Federal Reserve™s 

MBS purchases. Like euro area banks, US 

banks tightened their credit standards for 

loans to non-financial corporations in the 

aftermath of the financial tensions in
 2007, 
and markedly so at the time of the bankruptcy 

of Lehman Brothers. By late
 2009, however, 4 This is also the interpretation in Ennis, H.M. and Wolman, A.L., ﬁLarge excess reserves in the U.S.: a view from the cross-section of

Issue 3 / 2015not only had the tightening phase in the United 
States abated, but banks had begun to report a 

moderate easing of their credit standards. US 

banks continued to ease credit standards on 

loans to non-financial corporations thereafter, 

with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2011 
(see Chart D). It is possible that the strong 

weighting of MBS in the Federal Reserve™s 

purchases (about 80% in QE1 and 50% 
in QE3) favoured this development by 

facilitating banks™ balance sheet adjustment. 

By comparison, euro area banks continued 

to tighten their credit standards until the end 

of 2013, although to a lesser extent than in the 

period 2007-09.The annual rate of change in bank lending 
to non-financial corporations returned 

to positive territory in late
 2011 in the 
United States, following the easing in credit 

standards. Bank lending to US companies, 
which had been growing at rates similar to 

those observed in the euro area before the 

crisis, declined strongly during and after 

the 2009 recession. Its annual rate of change 

has improved continuously to recover from that 
trough. It became positive in the second half 

of 2011, and stood at 7.7% in December 2014. 
Although with smaller amplitude, total 

borrowing by US non-financial corporations 

shows a similar pattern (see Chart E). With 

some lag, the positive evolution of US 
lending to non-financial corporations mirrors 

the easing of banks™ credit standards. As 

regards the euro area, the decline in lending 

to non-financial corporations bottomed out 

in early 2014 and the annual growth rate is 
approaching zero, in parallel with the easing of 

credit standards reported by euro area banks.The growth of US lending to non-financial 
corporations has outpaced that of nominal 

GDP since late 2013. Of all the variables 

under consideration, the improvement in 

lending to non-financial corporations in 

the United States (measured as either bank 

lending or total borrowing), in particular 

the return to positive growth rates, occurred

was likely to reflect not only the recovery in

 IN WORLD TRADEAnnual world import growth has remained below its pre-crisis long-term average for the past three years, making it the second-longest period of weak growth in over 40 years. Moreover, 
world trade growth has not been weak in absolute terms alone; it is also weak when set against 

economic activity. Whereas trade grew at almost twice the rate of global GDP in the
 25 years prior to 2007, it has been growing, on average, at a rate below that of global GDP since  the second half of 2011. Both cyclical and structural factors are responsible for this weakness in trade. Weak demand and 
the demand composition of global GDP are important determinants of world trade. Model-based 
evidence shows that the decline in the growth of global GDP can, to a large extent, explain the 

decline in the growth of world trade. Structural factors also appear to play a role, with a potential 

slowdown in the expansion of global value chains likely to have a persistent dampening impact. Going forward, cyclical headwinds affecting trade are expected to dissipate partially. Global 
economic activity is expected to continue along the gradual path to recovery, which, in turn, will 

support world trade growth. Meanwhile, the influence of structural factors may persist over the 

longer term. The ratio of world trade growth to that of GDP is thus expected to recover, but is likely 

to remain below its pre-crisis long-term average.INTRODUCTIONOver the past three years, world trade growth has been exceptionally weak.
 Annual growth 
in world imports, in particular, has remained below its long-term average for thirteen consecutive 

quarters, and there are few signs of the gap closing in the near term. While such long stretches 

of below-average growth are not entirely unprecedented, the current episode of low growth is 

the second-longest period of weak trade in 
over 40 years (see Chart 1). This raises the 
question as to the extent to which world trade 
growth is temporarily dampened as a result of 

cyclical factors, and as to how far the current 

weakness is due, at least in part, to potentially 
longer-term structural changes.This article will assess developments in world 
trade in the post-crisis period and examine 

the main factors behind the weak dynamics.
 
While world trade fell markedly in annual 

terms during the Great Recession, in particular 

in 2009, it subsequently recovered to above 
long-term average growth rates in
 2010. The 
period of protracted weakness in trade did not 

begin until the third quarter of 2011, when world 
import growth declined sharply, falling below 

its long-term average, and it has remained at 

low levels since. This article therefore focuses 

on the period since the third quarter of 2011. Chart 1 World import growth(annual percentage changes; quarterly data)-16-12-8

activity. Since the 1980s, world imports have grown at almost twice the rate of global GDP. Since 
the third quarter of

declined to around one. The ratio of average growth of trade to that of output is also known as the 

gross income elasticity of trade.
1 The significant decline observed in this elasticity after
 2011 is robust to different aggregation methods and 

different sectoral classifications (see Table
 1).2 The weakness in trade was primarily due to 

lower growth in trade in goods, as growth 
in trade in services remained broadly stable 

(see Chart 2). The decline in elasticity appears 

smaller when looking at pre-crisis elasticity 

dating back to
 1951, implying that trade 

elasticity may not be invariant over time.3This article explores the causes of the 

weakness in world trade growth and the 

decline in the global income elasticity of 

trade. Section 1 studies the geographical origins 
of that weakness and discusses the role of intra-
European trade dynamics on global aggregates. 

Section 2 presents empirical evidence on the 

role played by cyclical factors in explaining 

the weakness in trade growth. The potential 

influence of structural factors is explored in 

Section 3. Section 4 concludes with the outlook 
for world trade.1 See, for example, the article entitled ﬁThe dynamic effects of trade liberalization: an empirical analysisﬂ, 
US International Trade Commission Publication, No 3069, Washington, D.C., October 2007.2 The quantification of elasticity based on the period 2011-14 can only be indicative, as the sample size is rather limited.

E REGIONAL PERSPECTIVEThe recent slowdown in world trade has been broad-based.
 In 2011, the post-crisis rebound came to an end, and the annual world import growth rate fell below its pre-crisis average. Overall, 

world trade growth almost halved in the period between
 2011 and 2014, as compared with pre-

crisis levels, although the dynamics varied significantly across countries. Growth was weaker in 

advanced economies than in emerging market economies between
 2011 and 2013. Since 2013, trade has lost momentum in emerging market economies, but has partially rebounded in advanced 

economies (see Chart 3).Trade weakness in advanced economies was largely governed by the situation in the euro 
area, where annual import growth slowed substantially in the last quarter of
 2011 and remained 
exceptionally weak until
 2013. In other advanced economies, trade growth was more resilient, 
supported by sound economic growth in the United States and by an increase in imports to Japan 

in the aftermath of the natural disaster in early
 2011. After a period of weakness at the end of 2012, 
trade in advanced economies rebounded at the end of
 2013, driven by stronger economic growth in 

both the euro area and the United States. In emerging market economies, the trade slowdown was dominated by dynamics in China.
 Average annual import growth in China more than halved to around
 7%, year on year, between 
the third quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2014, as compared with average pre-crisis growth 

rates. More recently, a series of idiosyncratic shocks in a number of emerging market economies 

has led to a further deterioration in trade growth momentum: Argentina™s economy has been very 

weak since the end of 2013, but when the country defaulted on its debt in July
 2014, growth was 
undermined still further; Brazil entered into recession in
 2014, as a result of low domestic demand; 
and Russia has been subject to international sanctions stemming from the conflict with Ukraine and 

has also suffered from the recent fall in oil prices (see Chart 4).Chart 3 Import growth across regions(annual percentage changes; quarterly data)01

Issue 3 / 2015The weakness in euro area trade has gradually dissipated.
 The weakness of late
 2011 and 2012 was due, in part, to low domestic demand growth and, in particular, weak investment dynamics. 
In this period, growth in trade between euro area countries slowed markedly, and turned negative, 

in quarterly terms, over the period between the third quarter of
 2011 and the third quarter of 2012 
(see Chart 5). Since the second half of 2013, however, intra-euro area trade has grown on average at 
rates above the world aggregate.The weakness in intra-euro area trade had a negative, although rather limited, impact 
on world trade growth. Indeed, world trade elasticity excluding intra-euro area trade was 

only 0.1 percentage point higher than the total world trade elasticity since the the third quarter of 
2011 (see Table 2 and Chart 6). This suggests that the slowdown in intra-euro area trade accounts 
for only a small fraction of the reduction in world trade elasticity.
4 Results are similar when the 
European Union, rather than just the euro area, is considered. 4 These results are robust to defining trade as an average of exports and imports rather than as imports only, and to using GDP aggregated 
with purchasing power parity weights.Chart 5 Import growth(quarter-on-quarter percentage changes; quarterly data)

GROWTH RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN GLOBAL ACTIVITY?The descriptive analysis of recent data 

suggests that the decline in trade growth 

can be explained, to a significant extent, by 

sluggish economic activity. The post-crisis 

decline in world import growth coincided with a 

gradual slowing of global real GDP growth (see 

Chart 7). However, trade growth remains very 

subdued by historical standards, as compared 

with growth in global activity, indicating that 

the explanation for the recent trade slowdown 

may lie beyond cyclical developments. A more 

formal econometric analysis is conducted to 

quantify more precisely the extent to which the 

weakness in trade is consistent with cyclical 

developments.5An analysis based on a bivariate Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model confirms 

that the recent decline in trade growth is primarily, but not exclusively, associated with the 

decline in economic activity.
 The two variables included in the model are global GDP and world 

imports.6 The BVAR model is estimated over the pre-crisis sample period (between the first quarter 
of 1981 and the fourth quarter of
 2007) in order to abstract from possible post-crisis structural 

changes in trade elasticity.7 The model is then used to produce projections of world imports (solid 
red line in Chart 8), conditional on the observed path of global GDP.
8 This counterfactual trade path 
is compared with the observed path of world trade (solid blue line) over the period from the first 

quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2014. If the paths of conditional forecasts based on pre-crisis 

regularities are higher than the observed trade path, it would suggest that changes in the economic 

relationships linking trade and global GDP and, in particular, changes in the elasticity of trade to 

global GDP play a role in explaining the observed weakness in trade dynamics. 5 See Constantinescu, C., Mattoo, A. and Ruta, M., ﬁThe Global Trade Slowdown: Cyclical or Structural?ﬂ, 
IMF Working Papers, No 15/6, IMF, January 2015 for quantitative estimates of the cyclical factor in the recent trade slowdown.6 The bivariate BVAR model used in this article includes quarterly data on global GDP and world imports. The model is estimated in 
(log-) levels, with five lags to capture potential long-run relationships and complex dynamics between the two variables. The estimation 
method and the methodology used to set the relative weight of the data and the priors are described in Giannone, D., Lenza, M. and

Issue 3 / 2015Chart 8 shows that the projections of world 
imports, conditional on observed GDP, hover 
at around
 5% and that the actual path of world 

imports is permanently below the projections. 

This evidence suggests that changes in the 
elasticity of trade to GDP may indeed partly 

explain the recently observed weakness of 

trade growth. However, the projections in 
Chart 8 involve an element of (forecast and 

estimation) uncertainty. In order to provide 

a more comprehensive statistical measure of 

how unusual the observed trade path really is, 

Chart 8 also shows the 16th and
 84th quantiles of 
the conditional forecast distribution (dashed red 

lines).9 Once uncertainty around the projections 
is taken into consideration, it transpires that the 

sluggishness of economic activity goes some 

way towards accounting for the weakness of 

world trade growth. However, the observed path of world trade remains consistently in the lower part of the 
forecast distribution, which suggests that the developments in real activity are not the only 

explanation for the weakness in trade.
 Indeed, the evidence described in Box
 1 shows that the 

BVAR estimates imply a post-crisis decline in the elasticity of world trade to global GDP from a 

value of
 1.6 (sample: first quarter of
 1981 to fourth quarter of
 2007) to 1.3 (first quarter of
 1981 to third quarter of 2014).10 The next section is devoted to a discussion of the possible causes of changes in trade elasticity.9 The practice of reporting the 16th and 84th quantiles of the distribution is standard in Bayesian econometrics. Note that, for normally 
distributed variables, the 16th and the 84th quantiles are one standard deviation away from the mean, meaning that this range also 
conveniently provides a rough measure of the standard deviation. 10 The results shown are based on global GDP aggregated with purchasing power parity weights. The model results, showing a post-crisis 
decline in world trade elasticity, are robust to the use of GDP at market exchange rates.Chart 8 Projected and observed world

trade and global GDP are linked in the long run, i.e. a measure of the elasticity of world 

trade to global GDP. The BVAR model is estimated in log-levels and the estimates are consistent 

with the existence of a potential long-run relationship between world trade and global GDP. 
An empirical measure of the potential link between world trade and global GDP in the long 
run is obtained by looking at the ratio of the long-run forecasts of trade to those of global 
GDP. The idea is that, if global GDP and world trade follow the same trends well into the future,

TRUCTURAL FACTORS BEHIND THE DECLINE IN TRADE GROWTHOne possible explanation for the decline in trade elasticity relates to shifts in the relative 
importance of GDP components.
 If the slowdown in GDP growth is driven primarily by demand 

components with a higher import content, such as investment, then a given decline in GDP growth 

would cause the growth rate of trade to fall to a more marked extent than would be the case if the 

same decline in GDP is driven by less trade-intensive demand components, such as government 

spending. Therefore, changes in the composition of demand can lead to changes in trade elasticity.
11 For advanced economies, the share of investment in GDP has fallen below pre-crisis levels in 

recent years (see Chart 9). For emerging market economies, the evidence is less conclusive, as 

the investment share had been rising significantly prior to the crisis; however, this increase in the 

investment share has been partially reversed in recent years in a broad set of emerging market 

economies (although, notably, this is not the case in China).11 See Bussière, M., Callegari, G., Ghironi, F., Sestieri, G. and Yamano, N., ﬁEstimating Trade Elasticities: Demand Composition and 
the Trade Collapse of 2008-2009ﬂ, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, No 5(3), 2013, pp. 118-151; and Anderton, R. and Tewolde, T., ﬁThe global financial crisis: trying to understand the global trade downturn and recoveryﬂ, 
Working Paper Series, No 1370, ECB, August 2011. Both papers suggest that movements in investment and exports have a bigger impact on import growth than that 

captured by movements in other GDP components.when the effects of transitory shocks have 
faded, then the ratio of the respective forecasts 

should reflect the relationship between the 

trends in the two variables.Elasticity is estimated for two different 
sample periods, in order to assess whether 
or not the relationship between global GDP 

and world trade has changed over time. 

First, the model is applied to data from the 

period between the first quarter of
 1981 and 
the fourth quarter of 2007 in order to capture 
the long-run elasticity in the pre-crisis period. 

Then, the model is applied to the full sample 

period (from the first quarter of
 1981 to the 
third quarter of 2014), which includes both 
the global financial crisis and the euro area 

sovereign debt crisis and in which, as argued in 

previous sections, elasticity may have declined 

by comparison with the pre-crisis sample 
period. The analysis is carried out on the full period rather than only on the post-2008 period 
because the latter is too short to provide reliable estimation results. The forecasting horizon 

chosen for the analysis is five years ahead (results obtained by using horizons of three years and 
eight years are highly similar).The chart above shows the outcome of the analysis. The results show that the elasticity of world trade to global GDP appears to have decreased 
when the post-crisis period is included. In particular, the BVAR-based point estimate of 

elasticity drops from 1.6 to 1.3.BVAR estimate of long-run elasticity of

Issue 3 / 2015The development of global value chains (GVCs) is also likely to have played a role.
 GVCs have supported world trade growth 

over the last 20 years. First, the international fragmentation of production chains should have 

a positive effect on the economic performance 

of participating countries, boosting productivity, 

and increasing economies of scale. Moreover, 
the rise in GVCs boosted world trade elasticity 

in the pre-crisis period. This is due to the 

difference in measures, as trade is measured in 

gross terms, whereas GDP is measured in value-

added terms. The gross measure used for trade 
results in the ﬁdouble countingﬂ of intermediate 

inputs to trade, which would not be taken into 

account in the value-added approach.
12 The gap between the gross and the value-added measures 
of trade should reflect the level of outsourced 

inputs in total world trade and can therefore also 

be used as a proxy for measuring the expansion 
of GVCs.13Data from the World Input Output Database 

(WIOD) show that the gap between the gross 
and the value-added measures of trade increased from around 33% in 1995 to 51% in 2008.  A comparison of the implied gross and value-added measures of trade-to-GDP ratios suggests that 

the increase in GVCs added
 0.2 percentage point to world trade elasticity over this period. However, 

the WIOD data show that the level of outsourced inputs in total world trade fell significantly 

in 2009 and remained broadly unchanged thereafter, suggesting that the expansion of GVCs has 
stagnated in the post-crisis period. Furthermore, recent anecdotal evidence suggests that in the 

wake of the earthquake in Japan in
 2011, firms have been striving to minimise the risks that arise 
from the complexity and length of the production chains.14In addition, more recent data on merchandise trade by end-use category show that the 

growth of imports of intermediate goods was the main driver of trade growth in the pre-

crisis period.
 However this stalled in
 2012 and 2013 (see Chart 10).15 Given that increases in the 
trade of intermediate goods can be closely linked to increases in vertical specialisation, the recent 

flattening suggests that a slowdown in the expansion of GVCs may be taking place, which could be 

contributing to the recent reduction in world trade elasticity.12 See, e.g., Nagengast, A. and Stehrer, R., ﬁCollateral imbalances in intra-European trade? Accounting for the differences between gross 
and value added trade balancesﬂ, Working Paper Series, No 1695, ECB, July 2014; further related work by the Competitiveness Research 
Network (CompNet); and Koopman, R., Powers, W., Wang, Z. and Wei, S.-J., ﬁGive credit where credit is due: tracing value added in 
global production chainsﬂ, NBER Working Paper, No 16426, September 2010.13 Meanwhile, world trade in value-added terms, as measured by the World Input Output Database, is subject to a number of important 
caveats, including assumptions made in mapping national input-output tables to global ones.14 See, for example, ﬁGlobal value chains: Managing the risksﬂ,

small but non-negligible role in the decline 

in world trade elasticity in the recent post-

crisis period. Protectionism in response to 

the 2008-2009 world trade collapse was limited, 
in contrast to what had occurred during previous 

crisis episodes.
16 This may have been a result 
of a higher level of trade integration in the 

world economy than in the past and of more 

developed global value chains, which have 

created an environment in which imposing 
trade-restrictive measures has more significant 

negative repercussions for the country that does 

so. Nevertheless, recent data and reports point 

to a certain increase in trade protectionism 

over the last five years.17 While the World Trade Organization reports only traditional 

trade policy measures, such as tariffs or trade 
defence, so-called ﬁmurkyﬂ measures also 
exist. Although they do not breach international 

agreements, they do have the potential to harm 

foreign commercial interests (for example, 

bail-outs or breaches of health and safety 

regulations). The Global Trade Alert
18 points to an increase in the number of ﬁmurkyﬂ measures 
introduced between 2012 and 2013, in comparison with those introduced between 2009 and 2011. 
While different sources of data point to a recent increase in trade protectionism, most of the 

available data cover only the period after the crisis, and thus cannot be used to assess differences 

in pre-crisis and post-crisis world trade elasticity. Recent research on trade protectionism shows 

that the countercyclical relationship between growth, competitiveness and trade protectionism was 

not broken in the recent crisis episode, but may have been weakened as a result of one-off factors, 

which implies a risk that trade protectionism could rise if trade remains weak.19Finally, developments in the supply of trade finance, a source of disruption to world trade 

growth during the Great Recession, do not seem to have played a significant role in the decline 
in trade elasticity since
 2011. A recent study by the Bank for International Settlements
20 finds that, 
while the shortage of bank-intermediated trade financing during the world trade collapse accounted 

for up to one-fifth of the world trade slowdown in that period, trade financing does not seem to have 

had a significant impact on world trade in other, more recent, periods. 16 See Bown, C. (ed.), The Great Recession and import protection

UTLOOK FOR TRADE 
Looking ahead, the cyclical headwinds to world trade are expected to wane.
 With global 
economic activity expected to recover gradually, world trade growth will be bolstered as well. 
 A recovery of the share of investment in global GDP would also be likely to lead to a partial reversal 

of the decline in the trade-to-GDP growth ratio. At the same time, trade elasticity, although rising 

from its current low level, is expected to remain below pre-crisis levels over the coming years, 

reflecting the assumption that some structural factors, such as lower expansion rates for GVCs, 
 will persist over the medium term.ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 3 / 2015S 1STATISTICSCONTENTS1 External environment S22 Financial developments S33 Economic activity S74 Prices and costs S11
