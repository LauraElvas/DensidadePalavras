 DEVELOPMENTSOVERVIEWThe Governing Council is maintaining a steady monetary policy course, firmly implementing 
all its monetary policy decisions. Purchases under the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) Œ 
of •60 billion per month Œ are intended to run until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until 

the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its 

aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. When carrying out 

its assessment, the Governing Council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on 

trends in inflation, looking through fluctuations in measured inflation in either direction if judged to 

be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. 
The asset purchase programmes are proceeding well and positive effects are visible. 
The monetary policy measures have contributed to a broad-based easing in financial conditions, which 
remain very accommodative. Inflation expectations have recovered from their low mid-January 

levels, and borrowing conditions for households and firms have continued to evolve favourably. 

The effects of these measures are working their way through to the economy and will contribute 

further to an improvement in the economic outlook.In an environment of very low interest rates, money and loan growth have continued to recover. Partly as a result of the expanded APP, monetary indicators have further strengthened and 
credit dynamics Œ while remaining subdued Œ have continued to improve. In April the decline in 

loans to non-financial corporations continued to moderate and the growth of loans to households 

increased slightly. These developments have been supported by a significant decrease in bank 

lending rates in much of the euro area since summer 2014, as well as by signs of an improvement 
in both the supply of and demand for bank loans. Overall, recent developments confirm that the 
ECB™s monetary policy measures are helping to restore the proper functioning of the monetary 

policy transmission mechanism and easing bank lending conditions. Indeed, the April
 2015 euro 
area bank lending survey shows that more relaxed lending conditions continue to support a further 

recovery in loan growth, in particular for enterprises. Moreover, increased competition between 

banks contributed to an easing of credit conditions in the first quarter of
 2015, in tandem with a 

pick-up in business loan demand. In addition, as confirmed by the survey on the access to finance 

of enterprises in the euro area (SAFE), the improvement in credit market conditions applies not 

only to large firms but also to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).A number of factors are supporting the gradual recovery in euro area economic activity and 
the labour market. Real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2015, 

after growing by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The data indicate that the economic recovery 

has broadened, which can be attributed to several factors. ECB monetary policy measures are 

contributing to a substantial easing of broad financial conditions and facilitating access to credit, 

for SMEs as well as for larger firms. The progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural 

reforms has had a favourable effect on economic growth. Moreover, low oil prices are bolstering 

real disposable income and corporate profitability, supporting private consumption and investment, 

while the weakening of the euro™s exchange rate has helped exports. In line with the broadening 
of the recovery, the euro area labour market has continued to improve somewhat, as reflected in 

gradually declining unemployment. However, unemployment is still high in the euro area as a 

whole as well as in many individual countries.Looking ahead, the recovery is expected to broaden further.
 Private consumption has been the 
main factor behind the improvement in growth so far and should continue to benefit from increasing 

wage growth due to rising employment and from the positive impact of the fall in energy prices 

on real disposable income. In 2015, moreover, business investment is expected to become a more 
6ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015important driver of the recovery, supported by strengthening domestic and external demand, the 
need to modernise and rebuild ageing capital stock, the accommodative monetary policy stance 

and stronger gross operating surpluses. In addition, export growth should benefit from the expected 

strengthening of the global economic recovery. At the same time, the necessary balance sheet 

adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms is 

likely to dampen the pick-up in activity.The June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
1 foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.0% in 2017.
 Compared with the 
March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real GDP growth remain 

virtually unchanged over the projection horizon. In the Governing Council™s assessment, risks to 

the outlook for economic activity Œ while remaining on the downside Œ have become more balanced 

on account of its monetary policy decisions and oil price and exchange rate developments.Headline inflation appears to have bottomed out at the beginning of this year, as the downward 
effects of past energy price declines have receded. 
According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, annual 

HICP inflation was 0.3% in May 2015, up from 0.0% in April and a low of -0.6% in January. This 

pick-up stems essentially from a less negative contribution from the energy component, which in 

turn mainly reflects some recovery in oil prices in US dollars amplified by a further depreciation of 

the euro. Inflation rates are projected to rise later this year and to increase further in 2016 and 2017.
 Towards the end of this year, the rate of change in the energy component is envisaged to be pushed 
up by base effects linked to the fall in oil prices in late 2014. In addition, the weaker exchange rate 

of the euro will exert upward pressure on inflation. Domestic price pressures should also strengthen 

on account of the expected closing of the output gap leading to higher wage growth and increased 

profit margins. The June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual 
HICP inflation at 0.3% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. In comparison with the 

March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the inflation projections have been revised 

upwards for 2015 and remain unchanged for 2016 and 2017. The projections are conditional on the 

full implementation of the ECB™s monetary policy measures. The Governing Council will continue 

to monitor closely the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this 

context, it will focus in particular on the pass-through of its monetary policy measures, as well as 

on geopolitical, exchange rate and energy price developments. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with its forward guidance, 
the Governing Council decided at its meeting on 3 June 2015 to keep the key ECB interest 
rates unchanged. 
In the Governing Council™s assessment there is a need to maintain a steady 

monetary policy course. The full implementation of all monetary policy measures will provide the 

necessary support to the euro area economy and lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards 

levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term.1 See the article entitled ﬁJune 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro areaﬂ, published on the ECB™s website on 
3 June 2015.7ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015The world economy continues to expand along an uneven recovery path. The significant fall in oil 
prices since last year (the recent rebound notwithstanding) is expected to boost global activity. 

Financing conditions also remain supportive for the global economy. In advanced economies, 

prospects are improving, as the headwinds of deleveraging and fiscal consolidation diminish. By 

contrast, conditions in some emerging markets have deteriorated, while global trade has slowed. 

Global inflation has declined owing to the fall in oil prices, and ample spare capacity worldwide is 

expected to restrain inflationary pressures.GLOBAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND TRADE 
Global growth momentum moderated in the first quarter of 2015, as the world economy 

continued to expand along an uneven recovery path. 
Growth in advanced economies dipped as 

an ongoing rebound in Japan was offset by slow growth in the United States and United Kingdom. 
Activity in emerging markets decelerated more sharply. Weakening investment, particularly in the 

real estate sector, weighed on growth in China. High levels of uncertainty, declining confidence 

and high inflation are also dampening activity in Brazil and Russia. Some temporary factors are 

partly responsible for the weak global growth at the start of the year. In particular, adverse weather 

and disruptions to west coast ports affected activity in the United States. At the same time, survey 

indicators point to underlying resilience in the global economy, suggesting that the recent weakness 

in activity is a soft patch rather than a more fundamental slowdown (see Chart 1).Despite rebounding recently, oil prices are still well below the peak reached in June 2014. 
Oil prices have recovered from the low reached in mid-January 2015 mainly in response to signs 

of a slowdown in US shale oil production, as reflected in a fall in the number of exploitation rigs. 

At the same time, global oil demand is gaining some momentum. Nevertheless, global supply 

growth and oil inventories remain high as OPEC continues to produce above its target, and the oil

Issue 4 / 2015market continues to be characterised by high volatility. According to the futures curve, markets 
have priced in a gradual rise in oil prices for the coming years.Lower oil prices are expected to boost global demand.
 While falling oil revenues are weighing 
on prospects for oil exporters, oil importers are expected to benefit as lower prices boost real 
household incomes. On balance, the impact of lower oil prices is expected to give positive impetus 

to global demand. Consumer confidence has risen in advanced economies since the middle of last 

year (see Chart 2). Financing conditions continue to support the global economy. 
Markets still expect only a very gradual pace of monetary tightening in the United States and United Kingdom, while the Bank of 

Japan has committed to continued quantitative easing. Disinflationary trends have prompted an 

easing of monetary policy in China, India and several other emerging economies. Brazil is alone 

among the major emerging market economies to have increased its policy rates, as exchange 

rate declines have stoked inflationary pressures. Continued accommodative monetary policies 

have continued to provide for loose global financing conditions. Stock markets remain generally 

resilient, and volatility is low. However, after falling earlier in the year, government bond yields 

have rebounded sharply in recent weeks. For most advanced economies, yields have remained close 

to the levels observed at the end of 2014, but this sharp correction has emphasised the potential 

medium-term risk of a further pronounced rebound in bond yields from still very low levels, which 

could have a significant impact on the global economy. Prospects in advanced economies are improving, as the headwinds that have been dampening 
activity since the financial crisis recede. Although the pace has varied across countries, some progress has been made with regard to private sector deleveraging. Fiscal consolidation in 

advanced economies is also expected to proceed at a slower pace than in the early phases of the 

recovery. Labour markets continue to improve, with employment expanding at a vigorous rate in 

some countries and unemployment rates falling. Finally, improved availability of external finance, 

stronger profit growth and diminishing uncertainty all favour a broadening and strengthening of 

investment activity in the medium term.The outlook for major advanced economies is supportive of global growth. Following the moderation in activity in the first quarter, US growth is expected to rebound throughout the 

remainder of this year. The past appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the US dollar will 

dampen export growth, and the decline in the oil price will weigh on energy sector investment. 

However, it is anticipated that US economic activity will be supported by stronger household 

spending following the boost to real incomes from lower oil prices, favourable financial conditions, 

and continued strengthening of the labour and housing markets. Activity in Japan is recovering 

after the slump following the VAT hike in April 2014, with a sharp rise in growth in the first quarter 
of 2015. Looking ahead, activity is expected to strengthen slowly as households benefit from the 

increase in real incomes provided by the lower oil price, and exports gain from the past depreciation 

of the Japanese yen. The UK economy softened in the first quarter of 2015, but is expected to 

strengthen as falling energy prices and accelerating wage growth support private consumption, 

while business investment recovers as demand grows and credit conditions ease.By contrast, the outlook in some large emerging economies has weakened. In China, both the slowdown in the housing market and the decline in production in many heavy industries weighed on 

growth in the first quarter of this year. While growth will receive a near-term boost from the decline 

in the oil price and recent monetary easing, in the longer term the pace of expansion is expected to 
9ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015slow as the political leadership tackles financial 
fragilities and macroeconomic imbalances. The 

outlook for Brazil has deteriorated, as growth 

has been dampened by supply-side bottlenecks, 

domestic imbalances, high inflation, fiscal 

consolidation efforts and tightening financing 

conditions. Russia is expected to undergo a deep 

recession in 2015. Notwithstanding some easing 
of financing conditions since March 2015, 

funding costs remain elevated. Uncertainty is 

high and business confidence weak, while lower 

oil revenue is expected to lead to a sharp fall in 
public expenditure. However, the outlook is not universally weak 
across emerging market economies, and 

net oil importing countries, in particular, 

are projected to sustain reasonably solid 

rates of expansion. Central and eastern 
European countries are expected to benefit from 

strengthening domestic demand and brighter 

prospects in the euro area. Some emerging 

Asian economies are also expected to maintain 

robust rates of growth as lower oil prices boost real disposable incomes, partly offsetting the impact 
of lower growth in China. As discussed in Box 1, progress with structural reforms have buoyed 

confidence in India, with the country projected to be the fastest growing large economy in the world 

this year.The slower expansion in emerging market economies has dampened global trade growth. 
Global merchandise trade data showed a decline of 1.6% quarter on quarter in the volume of world 

goods imports in the first quarter of 2015. Although a substantial share of this slowdown reflected 

very weak imports from China, which may partly reflect volatility around the Chinese New Year, 

the underlying trend appears to suggest a softer trade momentum. Survey indicators also point to 

somewhat weaker prospects for global trade in the near term (see Chart 3). Further ahead world 

trade is expected to strengthen at a moderate pace. The recovery reflects the projected expansion in 

global activity and an expectation that the cyclical recovery in investment, particularly in advanced 

economies, will raise the trade-intensity of global growth. At the same time, structural factors 

have affected global trade in recent years, as firms have reduced the complexity and length of their 

supply chains, such that global value chains are no longer supporting the expansion of global trade 

to the same degree as in the past. As a result, global trade is unlikely to expand in the coming years 

at the same pace as in previous decades.Overall, the near-term global recovery is anticipated to be less buoyant than previously 
expected. According to the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, world annual 

real GDP growth (excluding the euro area) is projected to accelerate gradually from 3.4% in 2015 

to just above 4% in 2016 and 2017. Euro area foreign demand is expected to accelerate from 2.2% 

in 2015 to around 5% by 2017. Compared with the March projections, expectations for growth and 

foreign demand have been revised downwards, reflecting the weaker outlook in several countries in 

the short term and, further ahead, slower growth in emerging market economies.Chart 3 Volume of world trade in goods(three-month-on-three-month percentage changes; left-hand scale:

Issue 4 / 2015Risks to the outlook for global trade and 
activity remain tilted to the downside. 

On the one hand, the impact of lower oil prices 

on the global outlook for growth might be 
stronger than that embedded in the June 2015 

Eurosystem staff projections. On the other hand, 

in the United States, markets continue to expect 
the pace of interest rate increases to be slower 

than envisaged in the latest FOMC projections. 

A faster normalisation of monetary policies than 

is currently expected by markets could trigger a 

reversal of risk sentiment. In emerging markets, 

the cyclical and structural headwinds that have 

been dampening activity in recent months 

could have a stronger and more prolonged 

effect than currently anticipated. In China, 

high credit growth and leverage pose risks 
to financial stability. Geopolitical risks also 

continue to weigh on the outlook, and a scenario 

in which tensions between Russia and Ukraine  re-escalate would have adverse implications for 

global growth.GLOBAL PRICE DEVELOPMENTS Global inflation remains low, reflecting the decline in energy prices. After declining since the middle of last year, annual consumer price inflation in OECD countries remained subdued, falling 

to 0.4% in April 2015. At the same time, although it fell slightly in April, annual inflation excluding 

food and energy has remained more stable, suggesting that broader deflationary pressures have 

remained more moderate. Outside the OECD countries, inflation in China and India remained 

subdued. By contrast, in Brazil and Russia, inflation has remained elevated as currency depreciation 

has led to higher import prices (see Chart 4).Looking ahead global inflation is expected to rise gradually. It is anticipated that previous 
declines in commodity prices will contribute to low global inflation in the short term, but once 

these lagged effects fade out, inflation is expected to rise. Thereafter the projected pick-up in world 

economic activity is expected to diminish spare capacity. In addition, the oil price futures curve 

implies a gradual rise over the coming years, as do futures prices for non-oil commodities.Chart 4 Inflation in the OECD countries 
and selected emerging market economies(year-on-year percentage changes)

After reaching historical lows around mid-April, yields on AAA-rated long-term government bonds 
returned, in early June, to the levels observed in January around the time of the announcement of 

the expanded asset purchase programme (APP). From a longer-term perspective, however, most 

euro area government bond yields remain very low across all maturities. Other financial assets 

have been strongly influenced by the sovereign bond markets, with corporate bond yields mirroring 

sovereign yields and the performance of euro area stock markets closely reflecting the decline 

and subsequent increase in euro area yields. The effective exchange rate of the euro has remained 

broadly stable over the past few months. After reaching historical lows around mid-April, yields on AAA-rated long-term government 
bonds returned, in early June, to the levels observed in January around the time of the 

announcement of the expanded asset purchase programme. In the first half of the review 
period Œ i.e.
 from early March to mid-April Œ there was a further significant compression of 
yields across the euro area. During that period the ten-year EONIA forward rate declined by 

around 50 basis points (see
 Chart 5), reaching a new historical low of 0.65
 %. In the second half 
of the review period Œ i.e. from mid-April to the beginning of June Œ that yield compression 

was more than reversed, with the ten-year EONIA forward rate increasing to around 1.70 %. 
 As short maturities remained anchored by the ECB™s deposit facility rate of -0.20 %, the yield curve 
steepened significantly. A broadly similar development was recorded for German sovereign yields, 

with the yield on ten-year German government bonds falling close to zero and the 30-year yield 

declining to around 50 basis points by mid-April (see Chart 6). By early June, both had recovered to 

stand at levels similar to those observed in January around the time of the announcement of the APP. 
From a longer-term perspective, however, most euro area government bond yields remain 
very low across all maturities, reflecting the ECB™s accommodative monetary policy 

(including the public sector purchase programme (PSPP)). The fact that the PSPP was widely

Issue 4 / 2015anticipated by the market well in advance of its announcement meant that there was a significant 
adjustment in yields before purchases even began, with longer-term EONIA swap rates declining 

by up to 50 basis points between end-August 2014 and the announcement of the PSPP in January 

(see Chart 7). The volatility observed in euro area yields after the start of purchases under the PSPP 

probably reflects a combination of factors, including a number of positive surprises regarding the 

euro area economy in the first half of the review period, technical market factors (such as supply 

pressures and low market liquidity) and a learning process whereby the market is adapting to the 

Eurosystem™s large-scale purchases of public sector bonds. Between the start of PSPP purchases 

on 9 March and end-May the Eurosystem purchased •147 billion of public sector bonds with an 

average maturity of just over eight years. The recent volatility in yields has been associated mainly with volatility in real rates. 
 An accounting decomposition of changes in the ten-year EONIA swap rate shows that most of 
its volatility has been due to changes in the real rate, while the inflation-linked swap rate has 

been relatively stable (see Chart 8). Section 4 on prices and costs provides more information on 

inflation expectations.Lower-rated euro area countries saw a widening of their sovereign yield spreads relative 
to Germany during the review period.
 That widening was driven primarily by uncertainty 

surrounding Greece™s access to finance and increased issuance of government bonds with longer 

maturities in some countries. The ten-year yield spread widened by around 40
 basis points in Spain 
and Italy and around 60 basis points in Portugal. However, from a longer-term perspective, there 

has been a significant and relatively steady convergence of sovereign yields across the euro area 

(except Greece) following the high levels observed in July 2012.Chart 7 EONIA swap rates(percentages per annum)Jan.Apr.Jan.Apr.JulyOct.20142015-0.50.00.5

 asset-backed securities (ABSs) Œ mirrored the developments for higher-rated sovereign 
bonds. In some countries, however, covered bonds and ABSs were affected by the uncertainty surrounding Greece™s access to finance, resulting in some increases in covered bond spreads and 

discount margins for ABSs. Corporate bonds and stocks were driven mainly by developments in sovereign bond markets. 
Corporate bond yields (for both financial and non-financial issuers) declined in the first half of the 

review period, before increasing in the second (see Chart 9), thereby mirroring developments in 

the sovereign bond markets. Similarly, the euro area stock market performed strongly in the first 

half of the review period, with the broad-based Euro Stoxx equity price index up by around 7% 
by mid-April. That strong performance coincided with the decline in euro area sovereign yields, 

which led to a decline in the expected future cost of financing and an increase in the discounted 

value of expected future corporate earnings. When sovereign yields increased again, most of the 

stock market gains were reversed, with the Euro Stoxx equity price index rising by less than 1% 

over the review period as a whole. The US Standard & Poor™s 500 equity price index was broadly 

unchanged over that period. US equity returns have outperformed euro area equity markets over the 

longer term (see Box 2).  The performances of euro area financial and non-financial stocks were broadly aligned in 
the review period. 
Since the beginning of 2014 non-financial stocks have performed significantly 

better than financial stocks in the euro area (see Chart 10), while US financial and non-financial 

stocks have performed equally well. Chart 9 Corporate bond yields in the euro

Issue 4 / 2015The EONIA gradually declined amid higher 
levels of excess liquidity. 
The higher levels of 
excess liquidity resulting from APP purchases 

and the targeted longer-term refinancing 

operation allotted in March triggered a gradual 

decline in the EONIA, which decreased from 

-0.06% on 5 March to -0.12% on 2 June. The 
spike that is usually observed in the EONIA 
at the end of the month was more contained 

than in the past, with the end-of-month fixing 
being negative for the first time in April. The 
 three-month EURIBOR fixing was negative for 

the first time on 21
 April, and it stood at -0.01% 
on 2 June. Box 3 looks at liquidity conditions 
and monetary policy operations in greater detail.
The effective exchange rate of the euro 
has remained broadly stable over the 
past few months (see Chart 11). Between 
early March and mid-April the euro broadly 
depreciated against other major currencies 

and experienced somewhat stronger 

volatility relative to previous months, in 

line with changing perceptions about the interest rate outlook for the euro area relative to other 

major economies. Thereafter, in the period to mid-May, the euro appreciated markedly both in 

effective terms and against the US dollar, thereby recovering some of its losses, amid narrowing 

long-term bond yield spreads between the United States and the euro area. In the second half of 

May, however, the euro weakened again, returning to levels similar to those of early March and 

standing 8.9% below the level observed one year earlier. In bilateral terms, the euro depreciated 

by 0.4% against the US dollar in the period from early March to 2 June. The euro also depreciated 
 vis-à-vis the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Russian rouble and the Chinese renminbi. In 

contrast, it appreciated against the Japanese yen and the currencies of commodity-exporting 

countries, as well as the currencies of many emerging market economies. The Danish krone 

continued to trade close to its central rate within ERM II.Chart 11 Changes in the exchange rate of

have improved. Moreover, a number of factors have recently provided increasing support to euro 

area activity. Lower oil prices are bolstering real disposable income, thus supporting private 

consumption. The recent depreciation of the euro exchange rate is supporting exports. The ECB™s 
expanded asset purchase programme (APP) should contribute further to easing overall financing 

conditions and enhance access to credit also by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 
Looking forward, the cyclical recovery is expected to become more self-sustained in coming 

quarters, driven by both domestic and external demand, and unemployment is expected to decline 

further. The June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area see annual 

real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.0% in 2017. Domestic demand strengthened in the first quarter of 2015.
 Real GDP increased by 
0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2015, after 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014 
(see Chart 12). Although no breakdown was available at the time of this Economic Bulletin™s 
 cut-off date, economic indicators and country data suggest that domestic demand continued to 

be the main driver of growth in the first quarter of 2015. It also appears that net exports made a 
slight negative contribution to growth, on account of relatively weak global demand from emerging 

markets in particular.Survey data point to a continued cyclical recovery in the second quarter of 2015. 
The composite output Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) improved 

between the first quarter of 2015 and the first two months of the second quarter. In addition, both 

indicators stood on average in April and May above their respective long-term averages. Chart 12 Euro area real GDP, investment

Issue 4 / 2015The economic recovery has maintained momentum and broadened across countries since the 
beginning of 2015. First, the relatively low price of oil has contributed to a substantial increase in 

household real disposable income. Second, domestic demand will further benefit from the ongoing 
improvements in financial conditions bolstered by the accommodative monetary policy stance, as 

well as from the easing of credit supply conditions, as evidenced by a net easing of both credit 

standards and lending conditions in the latest bank lending survey for the euro area. Third, euro 

area activity is expected to be increasingly supported by the gradual strengthening of external 

demand and the depreciation of the euro. In addition, factors such as private and public balance 

sheet adjustments, which had contributed to the recent prolonged years of very weak real GDP 

growth, are gradually reversing and exerting a less negative influence on economic activity in the 

euro area. Furthermore, the adjustment process in housing markets is expected to have come to an 

end in many countries, as signalled by a turnaround in housing prices. The acceleration of GDP 

growth in the first quarter of the year is also estimated to have been broadly based across euro area 

countries.The assessment of a continuing economic recovery is also reflected in the June 2015 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.
1 The economic recovery in the euro area is projected to broaden gradually over the next three years. Positive contributions to 

growth are expected from domestic and foreign demand. The ECB™s monetary policy measures 

should support activity in the near and medium term, through a variety of channels. According to 

the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections for the euro area, annual real GDP 

in the euro area is expected to increase by 

1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.0% in 2017 
(see Chart 14). Consumption remains the main driver of 
growth and gained stronger momentum at 

the beginning of 2015. Private consumption 
growth, which has been the main driver of 

economic recovery in the past quarters, is likely 

to have increased further in the first quarter of 

2015, benefiting significantly from stronger 

growth in real disposable income reflecting 

lower energy prices, employment growth and 

less fiscal consolidation. Following quarterly 

growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014, 
short-term indicators point to a further relatively 

robust increase in consumption in the first 

quarter of 2015. For instance, combined retail 

sales and car registrations for the euro area grew 

by 1.1%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter 

of 2015 and continued to grow at a similar 

pace in April. Survey data point to continued 

resilient developments in consumer spending 

in the second quarter of the year. For instance,

the ranges, involving a correction for exceptional events, is 

explained in the 
New procedure for constructing Eurosystem and 
ECB staff projection ranges, ECB, December 2009.17ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015the European Commission™s indicator for euro area consumer confidence, which provides a 

reasonably good steer on trend developments in 

private consumption, improved markedly in the 

first quarter of the year. Although the indicator 
declined somewhat in both April and May, 
 it still stands at pre-crisis levels and well above 

its long-term average (see Chart 15).Looking forward, growth in private consumption expenditure is expected 

to remain a key driver of the pick-up in 

activity. In the near term, private consumption should benefit from the favourable outlook for 

growth in real disposable income, although 
its momentum is expected to be dampened 

somewhat by the impact of the partial reversal 

of the decline in energy prices. Thereafter, wage 

income is expected to pick up on the back of 

steady employment growth and accelerating 

nominal compensation per employee. Investment spending has risen slightly in recent quarters. Following the contraction in 
investment observed in mid-2014 Œ resulting from sluggish demand, corporate deleveraging and 

political and economic policy uncertainty Œ gross fixed capital formation in the euro area grew 

weakly in the fourth quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing construction investment, while non-

construction investment remained flat. In the first quarter of 2015 euro area total investment is 

likely to have grown modestly, quarter on quarter, as industrial production of investment goods 

increased, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry rose markedly and confidence in the 

capital goods sector improved further. As for construction investment, construction production 

growth Œ albeit modest compared with the fourth quarter Œ and further improvements in confidence 

indicators point to moderate growth in the first quarter.Business investment growth is expected to gradually pick up. 
Although, the PMI for the capital 
goods sector deteriorated somewhat in April and May, business investment should progressively 

become a more important driver of the euro area recovery in line with historical patterns. The 

gradual pick-up in business investment will be supported by strengthening domestic and external 

demand, the need to modernise and rebuild the ageing capital stock, and the accommodative 

monetary policy stance, substantially amplified by the non-standard monetary policy measures and 

especially by the expanded APP. A moderate recovery in construction investment is expected to begin in 2015. Construction investment will start to recover in 2015 after a prolonged period of weakness, supported by very 

low mortgage rates in most countries, easing financing conditions, and increasing growth in 

disposable income. The progress in housing market adjustments in some countries as signalled by 

the turnaround in house prices (see Chart 16) will also bolster residential investment over time. Chart 15 Euro area private consumption

Issue 4 / 2015Exports are estimated to have grown moderately at the beginning of 2015, adversely affected by less resilient global demand than previously anticipated.
 While euro area exports of goods 

and services had risen by 0.8%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2014, a slowdown 

was observed in early 2015. In the first months of 2015, exports to the United States and Latin 
America continued to strengthen, while exports to China and other Asian economies were subdued 

(see Chart 17). Available survey indicators point to a rebound in euro area exports in the second 

quarter of 2015. Euro area exports are expected to continue to grow in the second half of 2015 and 

beyond, supported by a gradual strengthening of global demand and the lagged effect of the euro 

effective exchange rate depreciation. However, the momentum is projected to fall well short of its 

pre-crisis pace, reflecting both average lower global activity and lower global trade elasticity to 

growth. Euro area imports are expected to continue to grow in the second quarter of 2015 and to 

further strengthen over the medium term in line with the recovery in domestic demand. As a result, 

net exports are expected to make a marginally positive contribution to real GDP growth over the 

projection horizon. Box 4 reviews current account developments in euro area countries with large 

pre-crisis deficits.The euro area recovery is expected to take place against the background of a broadly neutral 
fiscal stance between 2015 and 2017.
 The fiscal stance, measured as a change in the cyclically 

adjusted primary balance net of government assistance to the financial sector, is expected to be 

broadly neutral over the projection horizon. The restrictive fiscal stance in previous years was 

mainly the outcome of the continued moderate growth in government expenditure relative to

trend will continue, it will be broadly offset 

between 2015 and 2017 by cuts in direct taxes 
and social contributions. The positive impact 
of automatic fiscal stabilisers on domestic 
demand will diminish over time as the economy 
recovers.The euro area labour market situation continues to improve gradually.
 Headcount 
employment (see
 Chart 18) increased 
moderately, by 0.1% quarter on quarter in the 

fourth quarter of 2014 (the latest period for 
which data are available). At the sectoral level, 

employment growth was led by the services 

sector (in particular by professional services 

and non-market services). At the same time, 

employment in financial and insurance activities 

continued to decline, for the 11th consecutive 

quarter. Employment in industry excluding 

construction increased only moderately, while 

construction headcount declined considerably 

after a temporary increase in the third quarter. Total hours worked continued to increase in the 

last quarter of 2014, at a faster rate than in previous quarters. Survey results indicate a continuing 

improvement in employment in the first half of 2015. Forward-looking indicators also point to 

some further improvements in labour market conditions. Unemployment continued to recede gradually from elevated levels at the beginning of 2015.
 The euro area unemployment rate declined to 11.2% in the first quarter of 2015, from 11.4% in the 

fourth quarter of 2014. Furthermore, in April 2015, the unemployment rate fell to 11.1%, its lowest 

level since March 2012 but still almost four percentage points higher than its pre-crisis trough. 

The ongoing declines in unemployment rates are visible across all groups (male and female) and 

across most euro area economies; nevertheless, substantial differences remain at the age group and 

country level. Looking ahead, euro area labour markets are expected to improve further over the short and 
medium term. Employment growth is expected to accelerate somewhat over the coming quarters, 

on the back of a strengthening recovery. As a consequence, the euro area unemployment rate is 

expected to decline further as the recovery broadens. However, some factors continue to dampen the pick-up in overall activity. 
Public sector indebtedness has continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace, and is expected to remain at high 

levels in some countries. Labour market developments Œ while generally improving Œ will remain 

overshadowed by high structural unemployment, notably in some countries most affected by the 

crisis. Both of these factors should contribute to maintaining upward pressure on precautionary 

savings by private households. The sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms also 

continues to weigh on growth in a number of countries. Moreover, the relatively weak outlook for 

potential growth, the protracted uncertainty related to the Greek situation as well as geopolitical 

tensions outside the euro area may continue to weigh on investment spending. Chart 18 Euro area employment,

20ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015While remaining on the downside, the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro 
area have become more balanced on account of the ECB™s monetary policy decisions and 

oil price and exchange rate developments. 
Downside risks to the outlook for economic activity 

include a further increase of geopolitical tensions, a stronger slowdown in emerging market 

economies (EMEs) and a less favourable than expected impact of TLTROs and the expanded 

APP. Other downside risks to real GDP growth stem from a faster than expected monetary policy 

tightening in the United States, with adverse spillovers to some EMEs, and from a stronger than 

expected rebound in oil prices. These downside risks are only partly offset by the upside risks 

relating to a stronger than anticipated impact of structural reforms and the EU investment plans on 

activity.21ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 20154 P
RICES AND COSTSHeadline inflation bottomed out in early 2015 as the downward pressures from energy inflation 
receded. The June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area expect 

inflation to average at 0.3% in 2015, but to rise significantly to 1.5% in 2016 and further to 

1.8% in 2017. HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to rise from 0.8% in 2015 

to 1.4% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. Risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium 
term will be monitored closely by the ECB™s Governing Council, with a particular focus on the 
 pass-through of the monetary policy measures, as well as geopolitical, exchange rate and energy 

price developments.Headline inflation for the euro area has been on an upward trajectory in recent months. 
According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation turned positive, reaching 0.3% in 

May 2015, up from 0.0% in April and a low of -0.6% in January (see Charts 19 and 22). While most 
of the upswing since January is explained by the less negative annual rate of change for the energy 
component, in turn reflecting a recovery in oil prices in euro terms, the pick-up from April to May 

reflects a rise in the annual rate of all main HICP components. HICP inflation excluding energy and food for the euro area rose from 0.6% in April to 0.9% 
in May. 
The increase in May reflects both higher services and non-energy industrial goods inflation, 
with the latter having increased for the third consecutive month.
 This measure of underlying 
inflation has remained within the range of 0.6% to 1.0% since late 2013. Global factors, including the effects of the appreciation of the euro exchange rate until May 2014 and the indirect effects 

of the declines in oil and other commodity prices until early 2015, are still exerting downward 

pressure on underlying HICP inflation. Once these lagged effects fade out, the pass-through of the 

depreciation of the euro exchange rate into non-energy consumer prices will become more visible. 

On the domestic side, the ongoing weakness in consumer demand and firms™ pricing power, as 

well as the adjustment  process in certain euro area countries, also help to explain the low levels of 

underlying inflation. The impact of the depreciation of the euro on 
inflation should become more visible in the 

coming quarters. So far, the impact has mainly 

been visible in import price developments, 

but not in domestic producer prices as yet 
(see Chart 20). Both the annual rate of change in import prices for non-food consumer goods 
and imported intermediate goods have picked 

up sharply. However, imported final consumer 

goods account for only a relatively small portion 

of the goods component in the HICP. Also, 

imported intermediate goods are to be found 

only in the early stages of the pricing chain and, 

further along that chain, producer prices for final 
non-food consumer goods have yet to pick up 
noticeably. Survey indicators for pipeline price 

pressures also confirm this picture. The PMI 

data for May show that input prices are picking 

up, while prices charged remained broadly 
stable. A delayed reaction of HICP inflation to 

the depreciation of the euro is normal, not only

Issue 4 / 2015because of the gradual pass-through via higher input costs but also because some of the impact Œ albeit with a longer lag Œ will come from the higher demand for goods and services associated 
with the activity and income effects from the lower exchange rate. Overall, a gradual pass-through 

of the exchange rate depreciation is expected. Box 5 examines the exchange rate pass-through in 

greater detail. Domestic price pressures have so far remained moderate, mainly on account of weak demand. Services price inflation declined from 1.9% in early 2012 to 1.2% in December 2014, and further to 

1.0% in April 2015, before increasing to 1.3% in May. The negative trend in services price inflation 

in recent years has reflected subdued developments in both wage growth and profit margins, 

which were modestly offset by increases in indirect taxes and administered prices. From a country 

perspective, the decline in services price inflation has been particularly pronounced
 in stressed or previously stressed countries (see Chart 21). This may, on the one hand, reflect higher wage and 

price flexibility following structural reforms and, on the other hand, the depth of the crisis.Looking ahead, HICP inflation for the euro area is projected to pick up in the course of 2015 and to rise further in 2016 and 2017.
 On the basis of the information available in mid-May, the 

June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area expect HICP inflation 

to average 0.3% in 2015, and to rise to 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. Compared with the 

March 2015 macroeconomic projection exercise, the outlook for HICP inflation was revised up 

for 2015 and remained unchanged for 2016 and 2017. HICP inflation is expected to remain low in 

the months ahead until upward base effects, together with the expected rise in oil prices embedded 

in futures markets, push up headline inflation in late 2015. In 2016 and 2017 headline inflation is 

envisaged to rise further as domestic price pressures in the form of wage and profit-margin growth 

strengthen on account of the further decline in economic slack and continued upward external price 

pressures, which in turn reflect the lagged effects of the exchange rate channel and the upward 

sloping oil price futures curve.Chart 20 Producer prices and import

measures of inflation expectations in the euro area from the low levels observed in January. 
Shorter-term survey and market-based inflation expectations, as measured by inflation swap rates, 

have edged up recently, in particular for 2016 and 2017. The recovery in euro area longer-term 

survey-based inflation expectations to around 1.8% signals that professional forecasters have 

greater confidence that inflation will return to a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium 

term (see Chart 22). Also, the five-year inflation swap rate five years ahead recovered, rising from 

around 1.5% in January to around 1.8% at the start of June, while the ten-year spot inflation swap 

rate over the same period increased from below 1% to around 1.4% (see Chart 23). A similar 

recovery was observed for other market-based measures of inflation expectations, including 
 break-even inflation rates derived from inflation-linked sovereign bonds from different jurisdictions. 

The rebound in market-based inflation expectations has been more pronounced in the euro area 

than in the United States and the United Kingdom, suggesting that market participants are, to some 

degree, reducing the downside risk that has been priced into euro area inflation expectations for 

some time. Overall, this implies that risks of deflationary forces or risks related to second-round 

effects of the recent oil price decline have receded significantly over recent months.Looking ahead, the Governing Council of the ECB announced that it will closely monitor the 
risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term, 
with a particular focus on 
the pass-through of the monetary policy measures, as well as geopolitical, exchange rate and energy 

price developments.Chart 22 Survey-based measures of inflation

Issue 4 / 2015In an environment of very low interest rates, money and loan growth have continued to recover. 
As a result of the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), monetary indicators have improved 
further. While credit dynamics have remained weak, the growth of loans to the private sector has 
continued to strengthen. The first quarter of 2015 saw a further decrease in banks™ funding costs. 
 Easier lending conditions are continuing to support a further recovery in loan growth, in particular 

for enterprises. In addition, divergences in bank lending rates across countries have narrowed 

further. Overall, recent developments confirm that the ECB™s monetary policy measures are helping 
to restore the proper functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and easing bank 

lending conditions.The recovery in M3 growth has strengthened. 
In April annual M3 growth increased to
 5.3%, up from
 4.0% in the first quarter of
 2015 and the trough of
 0.8% in April
 2014 (see Chart
 24). The increase in M3 growth was mostly driven by the narrow monetary aggregate M1, reflecting 

mainly the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of M3. Support also came 

from sales of public sector bonds, covered bonds and asset-backed securities by the money-holding 

sector in the context of the expanded asset purchase programme (APP). Thus, annual growth in M1 

accelerated further, reaching an annual rate of
 10.5% in April 2015, compared with
 9.0% in the 
first quarter of
 2015. Recent developments in narrow money, which is seen as a leading indicator 

for euro area economic growth, support the prospect of a continued recovery in economic activity.Money-holders are focusing on overnight deposits. The environment of very low interest rates and 
a flat yield curve are providing incentives for money-holders to invest in overnight deposits within 

M3. M1 made a sizeable contribution to M3 growth in April, benefiting from the elevated growth of 

overnight deposits held by both households and non-financial corporations (NFCs) (see Chart 25).

liquid monetary assets contributed in April to the ongoing contraction of short-term deposits other 

than overnight deposits. In addition, the growth rate of marketable instruments (i.e. M3 minus M2), 

which have a relatively small weight in M3, increased substantially and stood at 11.6% after having 

reached positive territory at the end of the fourth quarter of
 2014. The increase was broad-based across 
its subcomponents.Portfolio substitution is driving broad money growth. 
An assessment of the counterparts of 
 M3 (see Chart
 26) shows that its dynamics have been driven mainly by shifts away from longer-term 
financial liabilities and to a lesser extent by a declining, but still positive, flow into MFIs™ net external 
assets. The turnaround in loan dynamics has also been supportive. The annual contraction in MFIs™ 
 longer-term financial liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) held by the money-holding sector 

gained momentum and stood at -5.7% in the first quarter of
 2015 and -6.4% in April 2015 (compared 
with -4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014). Its strong contribution to M3 growth specifically reflects 

the flat yield curve. Relative to its peak in mid-2014, the contribution from the MFI sector™s net 

external asset position moderated significantly in the first quarter of
 2015 but still remains positive, 

supported by the sizeable surplus in the current account. This moderation reflects growing net 

portfolio outflows from the euro area in terms of debt instruments, which exceeded the rise in net 

portfolio inflows into the euro area in equity investments, reflecting a continued interest of foreign 

investors in euro area equities.Euro area banks™ solvency and liquidity position is generally robust. 
Banks have improved their capital ratios partly through higher equity issuance, but also through deleveraging and tighter 

lending conditions (stricter credit standards, wider spreads on loans). This emphasis on balance 

sheet adjustments and the marked progress 

in bank capital ratios have helped set the 

conditions for a sustained improvement in the 

bank lending channel of monetary policy.Banks™ funding costs continued to decrease in 
the first quarter of 2015. The reduction in bank 

funding costs is to a significant extent related to 

the expanded APP. Favourable bank financing 

conditions are reflected in the yields on unsecured 

bank bonds, which declined to historically low 

levels during the first quarter of 2015, falling 

on average to 0.8% per annum in March 2015. 

Banks™ deposit costs also decreased further, but 

there is as yet no sign of a general movement 

into negative territory resulting from the ECB™s 

negative deposit facility rate. Overall, the 

composite cost of bank funding shows a steady 

decline (see Chart 27), against the backdrop of 

net redemptions of MFIs™ longer-term financial 

liabilities. In this context, the April 2015 euro 

area bank lending survey1 showed that banks™ 
access to funding improved in the first quarter

Issue 4 / 2015of 2015 for all main market instruments as well as for retail deposits. Compared with the previous 
quarter, the improvements were pronounced in all main categories, but in particular for banks™ access 

to debt securities markets and to securitisation. 
More relaxed lending conditions continue to support a further recovery in loan growth, in 
particular for enterprises.
 The April
 2015 bank lending survey shows that increased competition 
between banks contributed to an easing of credit conditions in the first quarter of 2015, which 

coincided with an ongoing increase in firms™ demand for loans (see Chart 28). Banks continued to 

ease their terms and conditions on new loans across all categories during the quarter, mainly driven 

by a further narrowing of margins on average loans. While banks eased credit standards for loans to 

NFCs, there was a slight net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase. 

In addition, as confirmed by the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), improved 

credit market conditions not only apply to large firms, but also to small and medium-sized enterprises 

(SMEs). These positive developments are taking place in an environment where NFCs, and especially 

SMEs, still use market-based sources of finance less frequently than bank financing (see Box
 6  ﬁNon-bank financing for euro area NFCs during the crisisﬂ).Lower bank lending rates are reflecting the effect of the ECB™s non-standard measures. 
Significant declines in the nominal cost of bank borrowing for non-financial corporations and 

households have been recorded since the introduction of credit easing measures by the ECB in

 2014, when the ECB stepped up its efforts in terms of further monetary policy accommodation, banks have 

progressively been passing the improvement in their funding costs on in the form of lower bank 

lending rates: the composite costs of borrowing for households for house purchase and for non-

financial corporations in the euro area have declined by around
 50 basis points and
 40 basis points respectively (see Charts 29 and 30).Divergences in bank lending rates across countries have narrowed further. 
Despite some encouraging developments in credit supply conditions for the euro area as a whole, credit standards 

remain heterogeneous across countries and sectors. In this respect, the credit easing package 

adopted in June
 2014 and the APP have contributed to a narrowing of the cross-country dispersion 
of borrowing costs. Those euro area countries presently displaying lower annual growth rates 
for loans to NFCs have also experienced particularly strong decreases in bank lending rates for 

such loans. Credit dynamics have remained weak, but the growth of loans to the private sector has continued to strengthen. 
Adjusted for sales and securitisation, the annual growth of MFI loans 

to the private sector continued its recovery and increased to
 0.8% in April 2015, up from 0.5% in the first quarter of
 2015 and a trough of -2.1% in January
 2014. In particular, the decline in loans 
to NFCs continued to moderate (see Chart
 31), while the growth of loans to households increased 
slightly (see Chart
 32). These developments have been supported by the significant decreases in 
bank lending rates which have been widespread in the euro area since summer 2014, as well as by Chart 29 Composite indicator of the cost

Issue 4 / 2015signs of an improvement in both the supply of and demand for bank loans. Although the subdued 
economic climate and historically tight lending conditions still weigh on loan supply in some parts 

of the euro area, recent editions of the euro area bank lending survey confirm the assessment that 

credit supply tensions are gradually receding and point to rising demand for loans. After recovering in
 2014, the overall annual flow of external financing to non-financial corporations stabilised in the first quarter of 2015. The recent stabilisation mostly 

reflects the decline in the net issuance of debt securities by NFCs observed in late summer 

and early autumn last year. Recent monthly data show that debt securities issuance activity 

increased again in early 2015, following the announcement and implementation of the 

public sector purchase programme (PSPP). The overall nominal cost of external financing 

for euro area NFCs continued to decline in the first quarter of
 2015 and stabilised at low 

levels in March, as the increase in the cost of equity was offset by the decrease in the cost of 
 long-term bank lending. In April and May 2015 the cost of equity remained stable on balance at 
pre-crisis levels. The cost of market-based debt increased in May, but to a considerably lesser 

degree than sovereign yields, after having reached historically low levels in March and April 2015.Chart 31 MFI loans to NFCs in selected euro

29ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 20156 FISCAL DEVELOPMENTSWhile nominal balances have improved as a result of the cyclical recovery and lower interest rates, 
fiscal consolidation is expected to come to a broad standstill in structural terms in the coming years. 

This partly reflects the fact that previously prudent fiscal policies have weakened in an environment 

in which fiscal rules are applied more flexibly. Looking ahead, additional consolidation efforts will 

be needed to set the high public debt ratio on a sustainable downward path.The government balance for the euro area as a whole is expected to continue to improve. According to the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the general government 

deficit ratio for the euro area is expected to decline from 2.4% of GDP in 2014 to 1.5% of GDP in 

2017 (see Table 1). The improvement is expected to stem from the cyclical impact of the ongoing 

economic recovery and decreasing borrowing costs. However, the structural balance is projected 

to remain broadly unchanged until 2017, as improvements on the expenditure side are projected 

to be largely compensated for by cuts in direct taxes and social contributions on the revenue side. 

Compared with the March 2015 projections, the outlook for the headline deficit has improved 

slightly on account of a downward revision of interest payments.Government debt is projected to decline gradually over the projection horizon, although it 
will remain at a high level.
 The euro area debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to start declining from 
its peak of 92.0% of GDP in 2014 to reach 88.4% of GDP by the end of 2017. The improvement 

in the debt outlook, although less sizeable than projected in March, is mainly due to favourable 

developments in the interest rate growth differential and improved primary balances. However, 

the projected debt level remains elevated, underlining the need for further consolidation efforts to 

set the debt ratio firmly on a downward path. This is all the more important in view of substantial 

long-term challenges owing to the ageing population. According to the 2015 Ageing Report by the 

Economic Policy Committee and the European Commission, total ageing costs in the euro area 

are projected to increase by 1.5 percentage points of GDP to 28.3% by 2060, with much higher 

increases expected for several euro area countries (see Box 7 for more details). After a period of sizeable consolidation measures up to 2013, the fiscal stance is expected to be 
broadly neutral until 2017. In view of the projected limited consolidation efforts in the euro area, 

gaps with respect to the structural efforts foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact are expected to 

widen. Despite the likely shortfall in structural efforts, the European Commission™s 2015 spring Table 1 Fiscal developments in the euro area(percentages of GDP)201220132014201520162017a.

Issue 4 / 2015forecast considers all euro area countries that are currently subject to an excessive deficit procedure 
(EDP), except for Spain, to be on track for a timely abrogation of the EDP, which is mainly due to 

the deficit-decreasing impact of the cycle. However, given that structural budgetary positions are 

hardly improving, there is a risk that mistakes made in the pre-crisis period, when improvements in 

headline balances proved not to be durable, could be repeated. As the cyclical recovery gathers pace, 

it will be important to increase the emphasis on debt sustainability and to resume consolidation to 

achieve progress towards medium-term budgetary objectives in all those countries with remaining 

consolidation needs (see Box 8).31ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015Box 1 
THE RISE TO PROMINENCE OF INDIA™S ECONOMYIndia has gradually gained in global economic prominence over the past decade.
 In purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, in 2014 India was already the third-largest country in the 

world after China and the United States. With growth expected by many observers to remain 

strong in the future, India™s contribution to global growth, and thus its relevance for the euro area 

outlook, may increase further. This box attempts to put India™s recent policy developments into 

perspective and to assess the economic prospects and challenges for the country.India already plays an important role in the global economy. In 2014 it accounted for 6.8% 
of world GDP on a PPP basis (see Chart A) and provided the largest contribution to global 

growth after China (see Chart B). In contrast, in global trade and financial markets, India has 

played a relatively smaller role thus far. It accounted for less than 2% of euro area exports and 

just 2.5% of world imports in 2013, which is more in line with India™s share of world GDP based 

on market exchange rates. At the end of 2013, India was the recipient of less than 1% of the 

global stock of foreign direct investment (FDI); in terms of outward FDI, the country™s share 

of the global FDI stock was even smaller (see Chart C). India™s impact on commodity markets 

on the demand side has also been comparatively small, considering its large population. For 

example, its share of world energy consumption was less than 5% until recently Œ much smaller 

than China™s share (more than 20%).Chart A Shares of world GDP(percentages of world GDP)16.14.416.36.812.136

Issue 4 / 2015India is widely expected to outpace China to become the world™s fastest growing large economy this year. India™s near-term outlook has improved, benefitting in particular from 

recent policy reforms and the lower oil prices, which have helped the country to address some 

long-standing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, including high inflation and large current account 

and fiscal deficits. Consumer price inflation has fallen significantly in recent quarters and is 

expected to remain below 6% until the end of the current fiscal year (April 2015 to March 2016). 

In an environment of easing inflation, the Reserve Bank of India lowered its policy rate twice 

earlier this year, reducing it to 7.5%, and is expected to maintain an accommodative stance to 

support growth. In the future, the newly adopted inflation targeting regime could help to enhance 

the credibility of India™s monetary policy. Fiscal deficits have declined over the past several 

years, with the central government™s fiscal deficit falling to 4.1% of GDP in the last fiscal year, 

as the government took the opportunity of the lower global oil prices to remove some fuel 

subsidies. India™s current account deficit has also declined, falling from 4.8% of GDP in 2012 to 

about 1.4% in the last fiscal year. Recent policy reforms, including plans for accelerated public 

infrastructure investment, appear to have buoyed business and consumer confidence about the 

economic outlook. Against this backdrop, with recent data suggesting a faster underlying pace of 

growth,1 most forecasters expect India™s growth to accelerate over the next few years to around 
8%, outpacing that of China (see Chart D).Looking further ahead, India™s growth potential remains high as the country will continue to 
enjoy a large demographic dividend. Demographic trends suggest that by 2030 India will overtake 
1 The revised GDP series released by India™s Central Statistical Office on 30 January and 9 February this year shows a significantly 
stronger pace of growth in recent years. Having sharply moderated from 11% in 2010 to 5.3% in 2012, India™s economic activity is 
estimated to have rebounded by 6.4% in 2013 and 7.2% in 2014 Œ upward revisions of 1.7 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points 
respectively.Chart C Shares of global FDI stock(percentages)01

forecasts for India are on a fiscal year basis (e.g. 2015 refers to 
the fiscal year commencing in April 2015).33ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015China as the world™s most populous country 
with the largest labour force. By that time, with 

more than one billion people of working age, 

India™s working age population would be larger 

than those of the euro area, the United States 

and Indonesia combined (the economies with 

the third, fourth and fifth-largest populations 

respectively). In addition, in contrast to China, 

India™s working age population (as a share of 

total population) is expected to keep rising 

(see Chart E). As a consequence, the labour 

contribution to India™s potential growth would 

be expected to gradually increase over the next 

decade. For example, the IMF and Consensus 

Economics project India™s GDP growth to 

average 7.6% between 2015 and 2020.The outlook for India, however, depends on the country™s ability to address a number of 
major challenges. Recent policy initiatives by 

the government appear to have boosted market confidence, and they provide a stronger basis for 

stable macroeconomic management, including sound fiscal policies and a focus on price stability 

for the central bank. The Indian government has also taken a number of steps to improve the 
business climate. Additional structural reforms to address the legacy impediments to growth, 

including measures to reduce bureaucracy and speed up infrastructure investment, could help to 

sustain the strong pace of growth in the coming years.Assuming India fulfils its potential, its standing in the global economy is likely to increase. 
Given India™s rapid growth and rising share of world GDP, its contribution to global growth is 

likely to increase. According to the latest IMF projections, India™s contribution to global growth 

is expected to be even larger than the combined contribution of the G7 by 2018, albeit remaining 

second to China™s contribution (see Chart B). Chart E Working age population(percentage changes; percentages of total population)60.062.5

Issue 4 / 2015Box 2RECENT EQUITY PRICE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EURO AREA AND THE UNITED STATESDespite recent increases, euro area equity prices remain slightly below the peaks reached prior to the financial crisis. Euro area equity prices have been regaining lost ground since  mid-2012, albeit against the backdrop of a subdued outlook for growth. This upward trend was temporarily halted during the second half of 2014, when concerns about a double-dip recession 

suppressed euro area stock prices (see Chart A). In contrast with developments in the euro area, the 
overall equity price index in the United States is well above its pre-crisis peak level (see Chart B).Both in the euro area and in the United States, financial stocks have clearly been 

underperforming vis-à-vis non-financial stocks.
 A more detailed sectoral breakdown reveals 

that the price increases for non-financial stocks have been both stronger and more broadly based 

across economic sub-sectors in the United States than in the euro area (see Chart B). This can 

primarily be explained by the fact that the realised return on equity, a measure of profitability, 

has been higher in the United States than in the euro area for the past five years. Furthermore, 
over the same period earnings announcements in the United States have largely surprised on the 
positive side, whereas they have generally fallen short of market expectations in the euro area.Following the announcement of the ECB™s expanded asset purchase programme (APP) in 
January 2015, euro area equity prices have increased strongly. They have risen by more than 
17% since the start of the year and have been broadly based across financial and non-financial stock,

October 2007, but that peak was only slightly higher than the 

level in July. For the sake of simplicity, the euro area peak of 

July 2007 has been taken as the common peak date. The latest 
observation is for 29 May 2015.35ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015as well as jurisdictions. This contrasts with developments in the United States, where equity 
indices have remained largely flat since the start of the year (see Chart C).Volatility in euro area equity markets also declined following the announcement of the 
expanded APP.
 Before the announcement of the expanded APP, euro area stock market 

uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility, had been strongly driven by increased risk 

aversion associated with the political uncertainties in Greece. Stock market uncertainty in the 

euro area spiked around the middle of October as political tensions in Greece unfolded, and once 

more in mid-December when it became apparent that discussions in the Greek parliament were 

not leading to a resolution of the political impasse (see Chart D). Following the announcement of 

the expanded APP, volatility declined. Since mid-April volatility in euro area equity markets has increased amid increased 
volatility in euro area sovereign bond markets.
 The heightened volatility in euro area bond 

markets in mid-April predominantly reflected a strong increase in yields at the longer end of the 

yield curve for euro area government bonds. This increase mainly reflected a technical correction 

from the strong decline recorded following the initial phase of implementation of the expanded 

APP. The sell-off in bonds may also have been exacerbated by investors™ herding behaviour in 

an environment of deteriorating liquidity conditions. A dividend discount model can be used to further identify the recent drivers of equity 
prices. In this model, the stock price is the discounted value of all future dividends (Dt) and the discount factor is equal to the risk-free rate (
r), plus some compensation for the risks taken by 

investors, i.e. the equity risk premium (ERP), such that: PEDtt =1(1 + r + ERP)tChart C Price developments following

Issue 4 / 2015In order to render this model operational, it is necessary to form assumptions on the future path 
of dividends. Following the model proposed by Fuller and Hsia
1, it can be assumed that dividend growth will develop in three stages. In the first stage, which is assumed to last for four years, 

dividends are expected to grow at a rate of g
S. The second stage is an interim period (assumed to 
last for eight years) where dividend growth is expected to adjust in a linear fashion to a constant 

long-term steady-state growth rate, g
L, which is assumed to prevail throughout the third infinite 
stage. Under these assumptions, Fuller and Hsia show that equity prices can be approximately 
computed byPDr + ERP  gL  (1 + gL  ) + 8( gS  gL )It is assumed that g
S is equivalent to analysts™ earnings-per-share growth forecasts, while g
L is approximated by the future long-term GDP growth rate reported by Consensus Economics.2The increase in euro area equity prices recorded during the first few months of 2015 has 

been primarily driven by increased risk appetite and lower discount rates. 
The analysis of 
the dividend discount model shown in Charts E and F reveals that, for most of 2014, the positive 
impact on equity prices from improvements in earnings expectations and reductions in the 

discount factor was countered by heightened risk aversion (measured as an increase in the equity

a reduction in risk aversion, thereby strongly boosting equity prices. In addition, model estimates 

suggest that at least part of the surge in equity prices at the beginning of the year was related to a 

depreciation of the euro and weak oil prices. This was in contrast to the situation in the United States, where weak economic data in 
January 2015 was also reflected in a reduction in earnings expectations and only a slight 
increase in stock prices (see Chart F). The impact on stock prices was kept relatively contained 

only because the weak data releases led to a reduction in the discount rate, owing to the likely 

postponement of a tightening in monetary policy. The recent bout of volatility in euro area 

bond markets, which has resulted in an increase in the discount rate, is reflected in the subdued 

performance of euro area stock prices in May 2015. Looking ahead, long-term growth prospects in the euro area remain relatively muted and 
continue to constrain the performance of equity prices in the euro area vis-a-vis those in the 

United States. Although recent macroeconomic data releases have been better than expected, 

the prospects for a revival in euro area potential output growth remain weak. This has been 

weighing on analysts™ expectations for long-term earnings growth, with long-term expectations 

for the return on equity remaining much lower in the euro area than in the United States 
 (see Charts G and H). They also remain below pre-crisis average levels.Chart G Euro area expected return

Issue 4 / 2015Overall, in spite of the steady increase in euro area stock prices since mid-2012, and the 
more recent sharp increase following the expanded APP announcement, euro area stock 

prices remain at levels below their pre-crisis peak. 
Price earnings ratios remain close to or 

below their long-run averages across most sectors. Vis-a-vis the United States, euro area equity 

prices continue to underperform as concerns about the potential growth outlook for the euro area 

continue to dampen earnings expectations. 39ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015Box 3LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD 
 FROM 28˜JANUARY˜2015 TO 21 APRIL 2015This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations during the first and second 
reserve maintenance periods of 2015, which ran from 28 January to 10 March 2015 and 
from 11 March to 21 April 2015 respectively.
1 During the period under review, the interest 
rates on the main refinancing operations (MROs), the marginal lending facility (MLF) and 

the deposit facility (DF) remained unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.
2 On 25 March 2015, the third targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) was settled, with 

•97.8 billion allocated, compared with •82.6 billion for the first operation and •129.8 billion 

for the second.3 In addition, on 9 March 2015 the Eurosystem started to buy public sector 
securities as part of its expanded asset purchase programme (APP). The expanded APP consists 

of the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the third covered bond purchase programme 

(CBPP3) and the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP).4Liquidity needsIn the period under review, the aggregate daily liquidity needs of the banking system, 
defined as the sum of autonomous factors and reserve requirements, decreased by 

•23.5 billion compared with the previous review period, from 12 November 2014 to 

27 January 2015, to stand at an average of •582.2 billion. This decline reflects lower 

autonomous factors, which stood at an average level of •473.1 billion.The decrease in autonomous factors resulted mainly from the increase in liquidity-
providing factors. Among these, net foreign assets increased, on average, by •35.6 billion to 

•607.6 billion, mostly reflecting the quarterly revaluations of portfolios, which were sizable 

owing to the depreciation of the euro. The changes in net foreign assets were partially offset by 

the changes in other autonomous factors.As far as liquidity-absorbing factors are concerned, the decline in government deposits 
slowed, reaching an average of •66.1 billion, compared with •68.3 billion in the previous 

review period. Since the cut in the deposit facility rate to -0.20% in September 2014, government 

deposits have been on a continuous downward trend, as the introduction of the negative deposit 

facility rate and the adoption of the new Guideline on the remuneration of government deposits5 provided incentives to treasuries to reduce their cash holdings. This trend, however, reversed in 

the second maintenance period of 2015 when government deposits increased, as the continuing 
1 As of January 2015 the length of the maintenance periods is extended to six weeks to match the changes in the schedule of the 
Governing Council meetings. For more information, see: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2014/html/pr140703_1.en.html2 MROs continued to be conducted as fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment. The same procedure remained in use for the 
three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs). The interest rate in each LTRO operation was fixed at the average of the 
rates on the MROs over the LTRO™s lifetime.3 For information on the first two TLTROs, see the box ﬁLiquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from

Issue 4 / 2015decline in market rates reduced the available alternatives for treasuries to place their cash. 
Banknotes in circulation increased on average by •14.5 billion following the usual higher demand 

for banknotes over the Easter period, but also as a result of some country-specific factors.The volatility of autonomous factors increased further during the period under review.
 The higher volatility primarily resulted from the shift in net foreign assets in view of the quarterly 
revaluations of foreign currency assets, but also from changes in net assets denominated in euro 

as a result of more volatile foreign deposits at the Eurosystem. At the same time, the volatility in 

the demand for banknotes declined compared with the previous period under review, when the 

Christmas demand for banknotes triggered temporary volatility. The average absolute error in weekly forecasts of autonomous factors decreased in the 
period under review from •8.7 billion to •5.4 billion, mostly as a result of the decline in 

forecasting errors on government deposits. However, it remained difficult to anticipate the 

investment activities of treasuries while short-term money market rates were turning increasingly 

negative along with the increase in excess liquidity.Liquidity provision
The average amount of liquidity provided through open market operations Œ tender 
operations and outright purchases Œ increased by •13.3 billion in the period under review, 

to reach •771.9 billion. This increase was owing to the average increase in the outright 
portfolios (of • 48.6 billion) outweighing the average decline in the take-up in tender operations 
(amounting to • 35.3 billion). Liquidity provided through the tender operations decreased to an average of •511.2 billion, 
compared with •546.5 billion in the previous review period. This decline was mainly as 

a result of the early repayment and eventual maturity of the two three-year LTROs during 

the first maintenance period, which resulted in a •182.0 billion liquidity drain. Nevertheless, 

a fraction of this amount was offset by the regular liquidity-providing operations, the MRO 

and the three-month LTROs. More notably, the March TLTRO injected •97.8 billion into the 

banking system.In addition, the liquidity provided through outright portfolios increased on average by •48.6 billion on the back of the implementation of the expanded APP. 
The increase in 
the average liquidity provision from the underlying PSPP, CBPP3 and ABSPP (•22.0 billion, 

•30.4 billion and •2.7 billion respectively) more than offset the decline owing to the maturity 

of some bonds in the Securities Markets Programme portfolio and in the previous two covered 

bond purchase programmes.Excess liquidity
Excess liquidity rose by •28.7 billion to an average of •181.6 billion over the period under review, with significant differences between the two maintenance periods. In the first 
maintenance period, excess liquidity decreased to a level of, on average, •159.8 billion, mainly 

owing to the maturity of the two three-year LTROs. In this maintenance period, excess liquidity 

fluctuated in the range of •139.2 billion to •198.4 billion. By contrast, in the second maintenance 

period, excess liquidity increased considerably to an average of •209.4 billion, mainly reflecting 
41ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015the settlement of the third TLTRO and the bond purchases within the expanded APP. During the 
second maintenance period, excess liquidity moved from the minimum of •150.6 billion to as 

high as •273.2 billion. EUROSYSTEM Œ liquidity situation28. Jan. to 21. Apr.12. Nov. to 27.

Issue 4 / 2015Given the higher level of excess liquidity, daily current account holdings increased 
considerably, by •25.8 billion, on average, to •243.6 billion, compared with the previous

•55.5 billion. In the period under review, relative recourse to the deposit facility increased marginally 

to 29% of the excess reserves,6 compared with an average of 27% during the previous review period. 
Interest rate developmentsThe EONIA rate averaged -2.9 basis points and -6.1 basis points in the first and second maintenance periods respectively.
 The decrease in the EONIA rate reflected the continuing

In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, particularly large current account deficits 

were recorded in Ireland, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovenia.

2013 the current account balances of these economies saw a significant correction and, in 

most cases, turned into surplus. This box takes a closer look at the more recent current account 

developments in this group of countries.2In 2014 the current account correction in the euro area economies with large pre-crisis 

deficits came to a halt and even reversed slightly in some countries (see Chart A).
 In Ireland, 
Greece and Slovenia, the current account was broadly unchanged in 2014 compared with the 

previous year. In Spain and Portugal, it deteriorated slightly, by 0.6 and 0.8 percentage point 

of GDP respectively. A more pronounced deterioration of 2.0 percentage points was registered 

in Cyprus, although this was partly unwound in the first quarter of 2015. With the exception of 

Cyprus, all of the countries under consideration continued to record current account surpluses. 

Hence, the majority of the current account improvements recorded by the countries with large 

pre-crisis deficits between 2008 and 2013 remain in place.1 This box focuses on countries that in 2008 recorded current account deficits in excess of 4% of GDP and adopted the euro before 2008. 
Cyprus is added to this group, as it received EU-IMF financial assistance.2 For the earlier post-crisis period, see the boxes entitled ﬁProgress in the current account adjustment in the euro area in 2012ﬂ,

Issue 4 / 2015The recent current account developments mainly reflect a demand-driven recovery in 
imports, which counterbalanced the continued expansion in exports. In 2014 exports 
increased in most countries, particularly Ireland, against the backdrop of strengthening foreign 

demand (see
 Chart B). However, imports also recovered from their persistent weakness, which 

can be partly explained by a gradual pick-up in domestic demand growth. In Cyprus, Greece, 

Slovenia and, to a lesser extent, Portugal, a deterioration in the combined primary and secondary 

income account also played a role.3 In Cyprus, this was mainly driven by an emerging deficit 
in the direct investment income account, in Greece by a deterioration in the secondary income 

account and in Slovenia by a broad-based widening of the deficit on investment income.Looking at the 2009-14 period, the downward impact on the current account from the 
stabilisation of domestic demand was partly offset by sustained improvements in relative 

prices and costs, as well as the decline in oil prices. Compared with 2009 (when the nominal 

effective exchange rate of the euro reached its peak), the real effective exchange rates of the 

countries with large pre-crisis current account deficits, deflated by unit labour costs, have 

depreciated by 10%-30% (see Chart C). In the case of Ireland, most of the real depreciation since 

2009 is accounted for by decreases in the nominal effective exchange rate, while for the other 

countries the depreciation mainly reflected adjustments in unit labour costs relative to the other euro 

area countries and the rest of the world. With the exception of Slovenia, the countries with large 

pre-crisis current account deficits have by now largely unwound the losses in cost competitiveness, 

as measured by the ULC-deflated real effective 

exchange rate recorded vis-à-vis the euro 

area between 1999 and the onset of the crisis. 

However, the pass-through from unit labour 

costs into both producer and export prices 

remains incomplete, reflecting factors such as 

continuing barriers to competition in product 

markets and increases in indirect taxes.In 2014 the decline in oil prices also 
supported the current account balances of 

euro area countries with large pre-crisis 
deficits. Lower oil prices tend to reduce the 

oil bill and thus improve the structural deficit 

in trade in oil products. Between the last 

quarter of 2013 and the last quarter of 2014 the 

negative oil balances narrowed significantly in 

all countries except Greece (see Chart D), with 
price effects from lower oil prices being partly 

offset by stronger real imports of oil products 
owing to a pick-up in domestic demand.4 The resulting improvements in the oil trade balance 
were particularly large in Cyprus and Slovenia 

(around 1.5-2.0 percentage points of GDP), 
3 The primary income account mainly captures investment income and the compensation of employees. The secondary income account 
shows current transfers, such as receipts from the EU community budget.4 Greece Œ and, to a lesser extent, Portugal Œ hosts oil-refining industries and therefore simultaneously imports and exports oil and 
related products, such as light petroleum distillates.Chart C Breakdown of the change in the

positive effects of the decline in oil prices on the current account were partly offset by demand-

driven increases in import volumes of oil and oil products.Large and persistent stock imbalances call for sustained external rebalancing. 
Despite the flow adjustment seen over recent years, the countries with large pre-crisis current account 

deficits continue to record net foreign liabilities well in excess of 35% of GDP. This threshold is 

used in the context of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure to flag potential external stock 

imbalances that increase the vulnerability to future shocks. In most countries under consideration, 

net foreign liabilities are even above, or close to, 100% of GDP (see Chart E). Reducing these 

stock imbalances requires a combination of sustained current account improvements and robust 

nominal GDP growth over the medium term.Chart D Oil trade balance(as a percentage of GDP)-7-6

Issue 4 / 2015Box 5MONITORING THE EXCHANGE RATE PASS-THROUGH TO HICP INFLATIONThe depreciation of the euro since mid-2014 plays an important role in shaping the current 
outlook for HICP inflation in the euro area. In nominal effective terms, in May 2015 the exchange 

rate was about 10% lower than in December 2014 and roughly 15% lower than in March 2014 Œ 

the peak of the previous appreciation episode. This box reviews recent developments in import 

prices and producer prices as part of a typically lagged and incomplete pass-through of exchange 

rate movements to final consumer prices. The pass-through of exchange rate changes to HICP inflation can spread via a number 
of channels. Considering the euro™s recent depreciation episode, the first channel is the direct 

impact on the HICP via the retail chain as imported final consumer goods become more 

expensive. The second, an indirect channel, reflects higher costs due to more expensive imported 
inputs feeding through the different stages of domestic intermediate and final goods production. 

The third one, also an indirect channel, works via those price pressures which ultimately result 

from the stimulating impulse that a weaker currency has for economic activity and income. Import prices for both consumer and intermediate goods have increased strongly in 
recent months. The annual rate of change in extra-euro area import prices for consumer goods 
excluding food stood at 5.8% in March 2015 (see Chart A). This increase was much larger than 

that in the prices for imported goods from inside the euro area and, as output price inflation in 

the global economy has tended to moderate in past months, such comparisons suggest that the

HICP non-energy industrial goods).47ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015upswing in extra-euro area import prices predominantly reflected the strong upward impact of 
the euro™s depreciation that started in spring 2014. The annual rate of change in import prices 

for intermediate goods has also risen markedly since spring 2014. This is again likely to signal a 

strong exchange rate impact given that prices of oil and raw materials, which have an important 

role in the manufacturing of intermediate goods, have tended to decline since then.By contrast, industrial producer prices for domestic sales have not yet shown signs of a 
visible upturn (see Chart B). Producer prices depend not only on prices for imported inputs 
but also on domestic labour and non-labour cost developments, as well as firms™ behaviour in 

adjusting their margins in response to cost developments. In this context, the importance of foreign 

inputs tends to decline along the production chain. Consequently, the sensitivity of producer 

prices to changes in prices for imported inputs tends to be relatively high for intermediate goods 

industries but more lagged and muted in the case of consumer goods industries.1 Therefore, for the time being, the observed continued subdued developments in producer prices for domestic 

sales of consumer goods are consistent with the standard exchange rate pass-through having set 
in during the earlier stages of the production and pricing chain. The exchange rate pass-through to HICP 
inflation should become more noticeable 
in the coming quarters. Model evidence 
suggests that there can be a shift of several 

quarters between the exchange rate changes 

and their impact on HICP inflation. This 

reflects the time it takes for import prices 
to feed through the different stages of the 
production and pricing chain and for price 
pressures to materialise in the domestic 

economy as a result of exchange rate-induced 
activity and income effects. Moreover, only 

around 15% of non-energy industrial goods in 

the HICP basket are estimated to be directly 

imported consumer products. Given the delays 
in pass-through, the movements in exchange 

rates can generate overlapping upward and 

downward impacts. For instance, the impacts 

of the euro™s recent depreciation overlap with 

the lagged disinflationary effects of the euro™s 

appreciation between the end of 2012 and 

spring 2014. Hence, in the absence of further 
exchange rate changes, the largest effect of the 

recent depreciation on inflation may only come 

to the fore by the end of 2015 (see Chart C).2 1 See Hahn, E., ﬁThe impact of exchange rate shocks on sectoral activity and prices in the euro areaﬂ, 
Working Paper Series, No 796, ECB, August 2007.2 See Hahn, E., ﬁPass-through of external shocks to euro area inflationﬂ, 
Working Paper Series, No 243, ECB, July 2003. The impulse response functions used in Chart C are based on an updated version of the model provided in the aforementioned study. The responses 
are comparable with those of other models in terms of magnitude and timing. However, it should be borne in mind that a pass-through 

at each point in time may be different from average elasticities depending on the type of underlying cause of exchange rate movement.

48ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015The pass-through of the euro™s depreciation has become clearly visible in strong import 
price increases. 
In line with a typically lagged pass-through of exchange rate changes, the 

impact on producer and consumer prices should become more noticeable in the coming quarters. 

A delay and dampening of this impact with regard to the ultimate pass-through to consumer 

prices is a normal feature of the production and pricing chain.  49ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015Box 6NON-BANK FINANCING FOR EURO AREA NFCS DURING THE CRISISThe financial crisis has raised concerns about the potential overreliance of euro area non-
financial corporations on banks for external financing. This is particularly true for SMEs 

(small and medium-sized enterprises) and mid-caps (larger-scale SMEs), which usually have 

little direct access to capital markets and depend on effective bank financing in addition to equity 

finance and other non-bank sources of funding. The strong dependency of SMEs and mid-caps on 

bank financing has left them more exposed to the post-crisis weaknesses and deleveraging needs 

of the EU banking sector. This box focuses on the financing of NFCs (non-financial corporations) 

in general, comparing SMEs and mid-caps with large enterprises in the crisis period from 2009 

to 2014, based on the results of the European Central Bank and European Commission survey 

on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE)1. In particular, the box illustrates that during the 
crisis period, ﬁcredit-constrained firmsﬂ Œ those firms which, in the SAFE, reported that they 

had limited access to bank loans Œ tended to switch to non-bank financing (trade credit, leasing) 

more often than firms without credit constraints. It appears, though, that firms in the countries 

most affected by the crisis faced more difficulties in making this switch in financing.On the basis of the SAFE it is possible to calculate the percentage of euro area NFCs of 
different sizes which have recourse to various financing instruments (see the table below).
 
Firms that are surveyed in the SAFE are asked whether or not they used a set of financing 

instruments in the preceding six-month period.
2 These instruments range from internal sources 
(retained earnings), grants/subsidised bank loans, bank financing (credit lines, overdrafts, credit 

cards and loans) to various sources of non-bank external finance such as trade credit, other loans 

(informal or from a related company), leasing, issued debt, mezzanine financing and equity.1 The SAFE is available here: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/surveys/sme/html/index.en.html.2 For previous analysis using information derived from the SAFE, see the presentation by O™Toole, C., ﬁSME lifecycle and non-bank 
financing in Europe: what determines usage?ﬂ at the ECB workshop: SMEs™ access to finance: the role of financial and non-financial

credit) from related companies or shareholders, family and friends. ﬁGrants /subsidised loansﬂ involve support from public sources in the 

form of guarantees, reduced interest rate loans, etc. ﬁBank overdraftsﬂ include credit lines or credit card overdrafts. ﬁMezzanineﬂ refers to 

subordinated loans, participation loans or similar financing instruments.50ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015Bank-based instruments such as grants/subsidized loans, bank overdrafts and bank loans 
are used more than market-based instruments such as debt securities, mezzanine financing 

and equity.
 Retained earnings are also used, especially by large firms (see the table). While 

leasing appears to be the most used instrument, at least for medium-sized and large firms, it is 

not necessarily the most important in terms of volume or in terms of financing new investment. 

For most of the instruments, there is a clear pattern; the percentage of use increases with the size 

of the firm. This confirms that large firms typically have better and more diversified access to 

the various sources of finance. It is also interesting to note that, out of all the external financing 

instruments used, micro and small firms favour short-term bank instruments like credit lines, 

bank overdrafts and credit cards, followed by bank loans, trade credit and leasing, while medium-

sized and large firms have more frequent recourse to leasing, followed by bank loans (long-term 

and short-term) and trade credit. The share of NFCs making use of more than one non-bank external source of finance 
increases with the size of the firm. Out of all firms using non-bank external sources of finance, 

57% made use of just one financing source and the rest used at least two sources. Micro (72%), 

small (64%) and medium-sized (54%) firms mainly used one non-bank instrument of finance 

(see Chart A). However, over half of large firms (56%) made use of at least two sources of non-

bank finance. The differentiation increases with size: for instance, 13% of medium-sized firms

1) The estimations are based on weighted least squares 
regressions (see the report on the results of the SAFE at http://

www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/surveys/sme/html/index.
en.html for an explanation of the weights used in the survey). 

The regressions include country-industry fixed effects and time 

fixed effects and errors are robust. The number of observations 
ranges from 39,949 for leasing to 18,242 for equity.51ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015and 21% of large firms reported that they were using three or more external non-bank financing 
sources contemporaneously, while this percentage drops to 9% for small firms and 5% for 
 micro firms. Econometric analysis provides more information on the use of non-bank external sources of 
finance during the crisis. To investigate the determinants of the usage of non-bank financing, a 

dummy variable, which takes value 1 if the firm has used a specific external source of non-bank 

finance in the preceding six months or zero otherwise, is regressed on a set of factors. These are 

firm-specific factors related to the company™s demographics and financial situation and factors 

related to bank financing, such as bank lending costs and credit standards, and an indicator of 

bank credit constraints.3 These variables are particularly useful for detecting possible substitution 
relationships between bank and non-bank sources. Furthermore, country-level variables related 

to real activity (GDP growth and the unemployment rate) are taken into account and a distinction 

is made between countries that were less affected by the crisis (Belgium, Germany, France, 

Netherlands, Austria and Finland) and those that were more severely affected (Ireland, Greece, 

Spain, Italy and Portugal).Generally, financially constrained firms have been more likely to turn to non-bank 
financing such as trade credit and leasing. 
Chart B reports the estimated coefficients of the 

econometric analysis. Focusing on those firms that reported to have been constrained in their 

access to bank loans, the results show that they were more likely to rely on non-bank financing 

(trade credit and leasing) than firms that did not report constraints (positive coefficients in the 

left-hand panel). The coefficient on the use of equity is also statistically significant and there 

is evidence that credit-constrained firms made less use of grants, indicating that firms that 

had already been denied bank loans found it difficult to benefit from public schemes aimed 

at obtaining guaranteed bank loans. Furthermore, credit-constrained firms in countries more 

severely affected by the crisis found it more difficult to switch from bank loans to other sources 

of finance than firms with the same kind of constraints in other countries (negative coefficients 

in the right-hand panel). Overall, the findings in this analysis confirm that non-financial corporations, and 
especially SMEs, use market-based sources of funding less than bank financing.
 Although 
capital markets represent an important alternative source of financing for non-financial 

corporations, they are accessible mainly to larger firms with high credit ratings and which 

are generally located in larger countries with more developed financial markets. Unless non-

financial corporations Œ and especially SMEs Œ have access to alternative sources of finance, any 

decline in bank lending is likely to have an adverse impact on their ability to finance investment. 

By harmonising financial market policies and supporting a shift towards market-based 
 financing, the European Commission™s initiative for a capital markets union will make SMEs 

in Europe more resilient to bank credit supply shocks and will help to reduce obstacles to their 

access to finance.3 The dependent variable is a categorical one that takes value 1 if the firm has used a specific source of finance in the preceding six 
months; it is zero otherwise. The independent variables control for size, age, turnover classes, whether firms are independent or family 
owned and their financial situation in terms of sales and profitability, own capital and credit history. All variables are derived from the 
survey.52ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015Box 7THE 2015 AGEING REPORT: HOW COSTLY WILL AGEING IN EUROPE BE? 
Europe is facing a demographic challenge. The old age dependency ratio, i.e. the share of people aged 65 or over relative to the working age population, is projected to almost double in the 

euro area from around 29% currently to above 50% by 2060. If adequate structural reforms are 

not implemented, ageing will have adverse implications for the sustainability of public finances, 

particularly in the long run. Moreover, given that the labour force is projected to shrink, ageing is 

expected to dampen potential GDP growth. Owing to its adverse impact on fiscal sustainability 

and potential growth, ageing is also of relevance to monetary policy.This box summarises and assesses the main projection results of the 2015 Ageing Report 
for euro area countries. The 2015 Ageing Report, published on 12 May 2015, is the latest 
of the reports prepared every three years by the Ageing Working Group of the Economic 

Policy Committee. The report provides long-term projections for the period 2013-60 for all EU 

countries of total age-related costs and their components, i.e. pensions, health care, long-term 

care, education and unemployment benefits. The projections are based on a commonly agreed 

methodology and a set of demographic and macroeconomic assumptions. Total ageing costs in the euro area are expected to increase over the projection horizon, 
notwithstanding substantial cross-country differences. 
According to the 2015 Ageing Report, 
total ageing costs in the euro area are projected to increase by 1.5 percentage points of GDP, 

i.e. from 26.8% of GDP in 2013 to 28.3% in 2060 (see Chart A). However, developments in 

ageing costs are very heterogeneous across countries. While ageing costs are projected to increase 

substantially in Slovenia, Malta, Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany (by at least 5
 percentage 
points of GDP), they are expected to decline in France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Latvia. 

The level of ageing costs was highest in 2013 in Finland and France (both around 31% of GDP),

are expected to be the countries with the greatest ageing challenge in the euro area, with total 

ageing costs of well above 31% of GDP.Pension expenditure, which is the largest component of total ageing costs,
1 is projected to remain flat relative to GDP on average over the projection horizon. 
In fact, pension expenditure in the euro area is projected to return to its 2013 level of 12.3% of GDP by 2060 

(see Chart B). The dynamics in pension costs, however, differ substantially across countries. 

In the majority of euro area countries, pension expenditure is expected to increase (in particular 

in Luxembourg, Slovenia, Belgium and Malta, where it is projected to increase by more than 

3 percentage points of GDP), while it is projected to decrease in eight euro area countries 
(Cyprus,  Portugal, Spain, Estonia, Greece, Italy, France and Latvia). By contrast, the cost of 

health and long-term care is projected to increase in all euro area countries.Compared with the 2012 Ageing Report2, the projected increase in total ageing costs has 
been considerably revised downwards from 3.5% to 1.5% of GDP over the projection 
horizon. Ageing cost projections for Luxembourg, France and Greece in particular have been 

substantially revised downwards (by at least 4.5 percentage points of GDP over the period 

2013-60). A similar picture emerges for the change in pension costs, which have been revised 

downwards by 1.2 percentage points of GDP for the euro area compared with the previous report.3 The downward revision of pension cost projections seems to be largely driven by the more

Issue 4 / 2015pension reforms seems to be rather limited on average (see Chart C).
4 The new demographic 
assumptions seem, on average, to be responsible for around one-third of the downward revisions 
of pension dynamics, as suggested by, among other things, a sharp downward revision to the 
change in the old age dependency ratio (of almost 4 percentage points between 2013 and 2060) 

compared with the previous report.
5 This factor seems to be particularly relevant for Lithuania, 
Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia. Furthermore, the better macroeconomic assumptions 

compared with the previous report Œ in particular the more pronounced decline in the 

unemployment rate (of
 2.4 percentage points compared with the 2012 report) Œ seem to strongly 
contribute to the downward revision of the pension projections (see Chart D). The labour market 

effect is particularly pronounced for Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Greece and Portugal. The new ageing cost projections for several countries are exposed to substantial adverse 
risks as they rely on favourable underlying macroeconomic assumptions.
 In particular, the 
assumption that total factor productivity (TFP) growth, which has fallen substantially during 

the crisis, will recover to a growth rate of 1% in the long run appears optimistic for several 

countries in the absence of substantial growth-enhancing reforms. This also holds from a 

historical perspective. During the period 1999-2012, TFP growth was on average around 0.7%, 

with considerably lower TFP growth rates in Belgium, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg and 

Portugal (see Chart E). Moreover, the assumption that the unemployment rate will converge 

downwards to a long-run EU average of not more than 7.5% by 2060 (the average euro area 

unemployment rate is projected to be 6.7% in 2060) is only plausible if substantial labour market

Issue 4 / 2015the Ageing Report deviates from the standard (prudent) practice of basing projections on 
 ﬁno policy changeﬂ assumptions. In fact, if these assumptions did not materialise as expected, 
this could result in substantially higher ageing costs for the countries concerned.There are also risks relating to the reversal of implemented pension reforms.
 The report assumes that all pension reforms that have been legislated for in recent years will be fully 

implemented. However, a reversal of past reforms cannot be ruled out, as indicated by recent 

discussions in some countries. Overall, despite the more favourable ageing cost projections for many countries, further 
reform efforts are needed to curb the increase in the costs of ageing.
 The new ageing cost 

projections for several countries are exposed to adverse risks, as they depend on very optimistic 

assumptions for productivity and labour market developments. Without reforms to reduce 

structural unemployment and raise potential growth, ageing costs for these countries would be 

substantially higher. Thus, it would be misleading to interpret the new ageing cost projections as 

a sign of less urgency to foster countries™ reform efforts.57ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015Box 8THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MEDIUM-TERM BUDGETARY OBJECTIVE AS AN ANCHOR OF FISCAL POLICIESBy the end of April 2015 all euro area countries not subject to an EU-IMF financial 
assistance programme had to submit their stability programme updates to the Ecofin 

Council and the European Commission. In line with the preventive arm of the Stability and 
Growth Pact (SGP), these updates outline governments™ budgetary strategies for the current 

year and at least the following three years. They also specify countries™ medium-term budgetary 

objectives (MTOs) and planned progress towards them. Based on an assessment of the stability 

programmes, the European Council will endorse country-specific recommendations for fiscal 

policies on 25-26 June. These recommendations will take into account the January 2015 

Commission Communication on flexibility within the SGP
1, which provides new guidance on 
the fiscal efforts required to achieve the MTOs. Against this background, this box reviews the 

effectiveness of the MTO as an anchor of fiscal policies under the preventive arm of the SGP.The medium-term budgetary objective is the cornerstone of the preventive arm of the 
SGP. The MTO was introduced with the reform of the SGP in 2005 and reflects the budgetary 

target of governments over the medium term. It is defined in structural terms, i.e. corrected 

for the impact of the economic cycle and temporary measures.
2 MTOs are subject to regular 
updates every three years to reflect the latest estimates of the economic and budgetary costs 

of ageing, which are published in the triennial ﬁAgeing Reportﬂ3. The SGP™s preventive arm 
requires countries to make appropriate progress towards their MTO each year and, once they 

have achieved it, to maintain this structural budget balance. Specifically, the SGP foresees a 

benchmark structural adjustment of 0.5% of GDP towards the MTO, with higher adjustments in 

good economic times and lower ones in bad economic times. At the same time, the preventive arm 

regulation allows temporary deviations from a country™s MTO, or the adjustment path adopted 

to achieve it, to take account of the implementation of major structural reforms that have direct, 

long-term positive budgetary effects, provided that the country returns to its MTO within the 
 stability programme horizon. 
The track record of achieving MTOs is poor.
 Even though the MTOs have been part of the 
EU™s fiscal framework for ten years now, most countries have not achieved them in any single year 

during this time period. Furthermore, euro area countries have regularly postponed the deadline 

for achieving them, making MTOs ﬁmoving targetsﬂ instead of an anchor for budgetary planning. 

As a consequence, the euro area entered the financial crisis with a sizeable structural deficit
4,  which limited the scope for counter-cyclical policies and prevented automatic stabilisers from 

working freely.1 For further details, see the box entitled ﬁFlexibility within the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, Economic Bulletin, Issue 1, ECB, February 2015.2 MTOs are set by Member States according to country-specific circumstances. They must respect minimum values and are designed 
to serve three goals: (i) Member States maintain a safety margin that prevents them from breaching the 3% Maastricht Treaty deficit 

reference value during cyclical downturns; (ii) Member States™ debts are sustainable taking into consideration the economic and 
budgetary impact of ageing populations; and (iii) Member States have room for budgetary manoeuvre, in particular when it comes to 
preserving public investment.3 See also Box 7 of this issue of the Economic Bulletin, entitled ﬁThe 2015 Ageing Report Œ How costly will ageing in Europe be?ﬂ.4 The structural balance is also determined by the unobservable output gap, which is generally subject to considerable revisions over time. 

The output gap is estimated to have had a negative real-time bias of around 1% of GDP over the 2003-13 period, which also implies 
an overestimation of the structural balance in real time. See also Kamps, C., Leiner-Killinger, N., Sondermann,
 D., De Stefani, R. and Rüffer, R., ﬁThe identification of fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances Œ unexploited synergies under the strengthened EU governance 
frameworkﬂ, Occasional Paper Series, No 157, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, November 2014.58ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015The poor track record regarding MTO compliance was intended to be addressed as part 
of a significant reform of the EU fiscal governance framework
. Given the insufficient 

enforcement of compliance with the structural effort requirements under the SGP™s preventive 

arm, in 2011 the six-pack reforms5 further reinforced it by defining a ﬁsignificant deviationﬂ 
from the adjustment path towards an MTO that can eventually lead to financial sanctions being 

imposed on a country. In 2012 the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the 

Economic and Monetary Union (TSCG) made MTOs more ambitious: signatory euro area 

countries commit to MTOs not lower than -0.5% of GDP (compared with MTOs not lower 

than -1% of GDP before), unless their debt level is significantly below 60% of GDP and the 

risks to long-term sustainability are low. Furthermore, in 2013 the ﬁcalendars of convergenceﬂ, 

i.e. country-specific time frames for achieving MTOs by a specified year, were put forward by 

the Commission as a follow-up to the TSCG.6 The correction mechanism provided for in the TSCG, which should be triggered automatically at the national level in the event of a ﬁsignificant 

deviationﬂ from the MTO or the adjustment path towards it, was expected to ensure rapid 

convergence of countries towards their respective MTOs.However, available evidence suggests that compliance with the MTOs has not significantly 
improved over recent years (see chart). 
Notably, MTO deadlines as set in the 2015 stability 

programmes are, for a large number of countries, further in the future than prescribed in the 
5 Five regulations and one directive on fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance in the EU.6 The deadlines for achieving the MTOs were set on the basis of the medium-term budgetary plans presented in the 2013 update of the stability 
and convergence programmes and in line with the SGP. See European Commission, ﬁReport on public finances in EMU 2013ﬂ, Part
 1,  Annex 1, European Economy, Issue 4, European Commission, Brussels, 2013.Year of achieving the MTO as recommended in the 2013 calendar of convergence

expected to be achieved as set out by the 2015 stability programme updates. The years of achieving the MTOs are based on the structural 

balances outlined in the stability programmes as recalculated by the Commission using the commonly agreed methodology and taking 

into account the 0.25% compliance margin. Consequently, the year of achieving the MTO as planned within a stability programme may 

differ from the year it is expected to be achieved according to the Commission calculations. For example, Portugal plans to reach its MTO 

in 2016, Italy and Slovakia in 2017, France in 2018 and Spain in 2019. For MTOs that are planned to be reached ﬁbeyond horizonﬂ no 

recalculated structural balances are available. ﬁBeyond horizonﬂ denotes a time frame beyond the final year included in the 2015 stability 

programme, which is 2018 for Belgium, Spain, France and Slovakia, and 2019 for Finland. The dotted line thus reflects the period beyond 

the programme horizon. For Ireland the deadline has not changed. 59ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 20152013 calendars of convergence. The Commission Communication on flexibility within the SGP 
released earlier this year may entail a slowdown in countries™ progress towards the MTOs.
7 This clarified but also extended the SGP™s flexibility as regards the application of the rules in three 

major areas: (i)
 cyclical conditions, (ii) structural reforms and (iii) government investment. When 

eligible under the structural reform and investment clause, countries are allowed to deviate from 

the adjustment path towards their MTOs.
8 For example, in their 2015 update of the stability 
programmes, Latvia and Italy applied to be considered under the structural reform clause for 
2016.9 Latvia was not granted a deviation under the clause owing to the absence of a sufficient 
safety margin towards the 3% deficit value. In the case of Italy, the European Commission 

allowed it to temporarily deviate by 0.4% of GDP from the required adjustment towards its MTO 

in 2016, after a zero adjustment requirement in 2014 and a reduced requirement in 2015 based 

on changes in the treatment of cyclical conditions applied by the Commission in spring 2014 and 

January 2015, respectively. Lithuania applied for the pension reform clause, but its eligibility 

will depend on Eurostat™s confirmation of the systemic nature of the reform. Other
 countries, 
e.g. Slovakia, may benefit from the cyclical conditions clause, as their adjustment requirements 

have been lowered.If used excessively, SGP flexibility could lead to further sizeable and long-lasting 
deviations from the adjustment path towards the MTOs, which could increase risks to debt 
 sustainability. It is therefore essential to avoid the ﬁmoving-target syndromeﬂ from which the 

preventive arm of the SGP suffered before the crisis. If euro area countries fail to restore fiscal 

buffers in a timely manner, they will be ill-prepared for adverse economic shocks, which is 

precisely when fiscal stabilisation is most needed. The current environment of strengthening 

economic recovery and favourable financial conditions should be used to accelerate progress 

towards MTOs. This would increase the resilience of the euro area economy.7 On 13 January 2015 the European Commission issued a Communication entitled ﬁMaking the best use of the flexibility within the 
existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, see http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/pdf/2015-01-
13_communication_sgp_flexibility_guidelines_en.pdf.8 For further details, see the box entitled ﬁFlexibility within the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, op. cit.9 In its 2015 convergence programme update, Romania applied to be considered under the structural reform clause, but its application 
has not yet been accepted owing to an absence of sufficiently detailed information.61ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015ARTICLESTHE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL BANK BALANCE  SHEET IN MONETARY POLICYThis article discusses the use of the central bank balance sheet as a monetary policy tool, focusing 
in particular on the experience of the ECB but also reporting on that of other monetary authorities. 

Since the financial crisis started in 2007-08 central banks have used their balance sheets to 

perform a variety of interventions, altering their size and composition to varying degrees. These 

interventions include operations to provide ﬁfunding reassuranceﬂ to counterparties; credit easing 

measures to enable or improve the transmission of the monetary policy stance in the presence of 

market impairments; and large-scale purchases of securities to provide additional monetary policy 

accommodation at times when short-term nominal interest rates are at their effective lower bound. In pursuit of its price stability mandate, the ECB has implemented all of these measures, including 
large-scale purchases of public sector securities with the introduction of the expanded asset 

purchase programme earlier this year. The use of the Eurosystem balance sheet has thus evolved 

from a relatively passive approach, with liquidity provision being determined by the needs of 

Eurosystem counterparties, to more active management of the size and composition of balance 

sheet assets in order to ensure the appropriate degree of monetary accommodation.1 INTRODUCTIONThe ECB™s asset purchase programmes have marked a more active use of the Eurosystem 

balance sheet in pursuit of the ECB™s price stability mandate. 
In September and November
 2014 
the ECB began to implement purchases of covered bonds and asset-backed securities (ABS) 

respectively. In January 2015 it decided to expand the asset purchase programmes to include 

secondary market purchases of securities issued by the public sector in the euro area. These 

purchases are a further instance of how changing the size and composition of the Eurosystem 

balance sheet is used as an instrument in pursuit of the ECB™s price stability mandate. Throughout the crisis central banks around the world moved beyond their traditional 
operating frameworks to make use of their balance sheets as a monetary policy tool
. Monetary 
authorities have deployed their balance sheets when liquidity shortages and market impairments, 

resulting from elevated liquidity and credit risk premia, impeded the transmission of the intended 

monetary policy stance; and when a further easing of the stance was needed at times when short-

term nominal interest rates were at their effective lower bound. The explicit and active calibration 

of the size and composition of the central bank balance sheet as a monetary policy tool has in 

many respects been novel, since within contemporary central bank operating frameworks Œ 

notwithstanding all the differences in economic and financial structures and central banking 

traditions across jurisdictions Œ monetary authorities primarily pursue their mandates through the 

setting of an operational target for a short-term interest rate. Within such frameworks, the balance 

sheet of the central bank plays a subordinate role. This article discusses the role of the balance sheet of a central bank as an instrument of 
monetary policy,1 focusing in particular on the policies of the ECB. Section 2 provides an overview of the different ways in which monetary authorities use their balance sheets. Section 3 
1 The central bank balance sheet is a financial statement that records assets and liabilities resulting from monetary policy instruments and 
autonomous factors (for example, government deposits and banknotes). Monetary policy instruments are those financial contracts that 
the central bank enters into in pursuit of its goals. It is the different types of financial contract Œ for different nominal amounts Œ that 
have implications for financial market prices and the economy, rather than the central bank balance sheet per se. This article nonetheless 
follows established practice and refers to the central bank balance sheet as an instrument of monetary policy.62ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015focuses on the euro area experience, while a box describes recent developments in the Eurosystem 
balance sheet. Section 4 concludes.2 T
HE CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEET AS A MONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENT 
2.1 T
HE CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEET: FROM SIDESHOW TO POLICY INSTRUMENTMonetary policy attempts to influence broad financial and macroeconomic conditions in order to 
achieve the goals that the central bank has been tasked with in its mandate. This is done by varying 

the monetary policy stance Œ the contribution monetary policy makes to economic, financial and 

monetary developments. In ﬁnormalﬂ times the stance of monetary policy is signalled by the price of central bank 
reserves. Within most contemporary central bank operating frameworks, the monetary policy 

stance is very often revealed by the price at which banks can trade central bank reserves in the 

interbank market, which is, in turn, influenced by the price at which central banks make these 

reserves available to banks. Within such operating frameworks, the central bank injects reserves 

into the banking system according to banks™ demand in order to steer the interbank interest rate 

towards a level that is consistent with the intended monetary policy stance. Consequently, in ﬁnormalﬂ times the composition and size of the central bank balance sheet 
contain limited information on the degree of monetary accommodation provided
. The size of 

the balance sheet results passively from the need to steer the short-term interest rate(s) in line with 

the desired stance. The quantity of liabilities Œ as well as assets Œ and hence the size of the balance 

sheet is largely determined by the demand for funds on the part of the central bank™s counterparties, 

which is, in turn, determined by the liquidity needs of the banking system. Put differently, the central 

bank must supply, inelastically, the quantity of reserves required by the banking system in order to 

control the short-term interest rate. The composition of the assets and liabilities on the balance 

sheet reflects institutional characteristics of central bank liquidity management, including collateral 

policies and modalities of liquidity provision and absorption. In short, when the instrument of 

monetary policy is the short-term interest rate, the size and composition of the central bank balance 

sheet do not provide information about the monetary policy stance.2 With the advent of the financial crisis, central banks began using their balance sheets in 

different ways Œ some of which were novel, at least in the contemporary context, while others 
were in line with traditional central bank tasks and practices
. Faced with the strains and risks of 
the financial crisis, central banks took one or more of the following actions: increasing liquidity provision to their banking systems elastically, i.e. accommodating banks™ 
increased demand for liquidity, and modifying the modalities of liquidity provision to give 

funding reassurance, in some cases by also providing term lending;launching direct lending operations for the non-bank private sector or purchasing private sector 

assets;2 This is not the case for central banks with operating frameworks that involve some degree of active management of the exchange rate. 
In these cases, both the total size of the assets and the composition of the assets and liabilities may provide information about the desired 
stance of monetary policy. 63ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015starting to purchase medium and long-dated public sector securities, or securities guaranteed by 
governments, on a large scale;offering explicit verbal guidance on the evolution of policy in the future, including indications 

about the future use of the central bank balance sheet if specific developments materialise. All of these actions involve Œ although to varying degrees Œ an expansion in the size of the 
central bank balance sheet
 and a modification of its composition 
(see Chart 1). However, 
caution is required when comparing central bank balance sheets across jurisdictions and also when 
comparing balance sheets of the same jurisdiction over time. As discussed in this article, a unit of 

liquidity will have very different economic effects depending not only on the financial structures 

and central bank operating procedures in place, but also on the use to which the central bank balance 

sheet is put Œ that is, its use as an instrument to address specific policy needs. Three main reasons for the increased use of central banks™ balance sheets can be identified: (1) the need to respond to financial stress and manage financial crises Œ in line with central banks™ 

traditional function as the ultimate provider of funding reassurance for the banking system; (2) the 

need to enable or improve the transmission of the intended monetary policy stance in the presence 

of market impairments; and (3) the need to provide additional monetary accommodation Œ that is, to 

further ease the stance Œ by exerting downward 

pressure on long-term interest rates when short-
term nominal policy rates have been reduced to 

their effective lower bound. In principle, these 

three objectives are complementary, while in 

practice they may be closely related. In any case, 

the measures deployed for any one of the above 

reasons can have very similar implications for 

the monetary policy stance. For example, by 

compressing the spreads between the market 

costs of borrowing and the risk-free interest rates, 

thus allowing a better pass-through of the stance, 

transmission-enhancing measures can also be 

regarded as increasing the degree of monetary 

accommodation.The discussion in this article will distinguish 
between ﬁpassiveﬂ and ﬁactiveﬂ uses of 

the central bank balance sheet, while 

announcements about potential future 

balance sheet measures are termed ﬁcontingent 

balance sheet policiesﬂ.3 The
 fully elastic supply 
3 There are many different taxonomies of central banks™ use of their balance sheets. Bernanke and Reinhart (Bernanke, B. and V. Reinhart, 
ﬁConducting Monetary Policy at Very Low Short-Term Interest Ratesﬂ, 
American Economic Review
, Vol. 94, No 2, 2004, pp. 85-90) distinguish policies that affect the size of the central bank balance sheet from those that affect the composition of the asset side. Borio and 

Disyatat (Borio, C. and P. Disyatat, ﬁUnconventional Monetary Policies: An Appraisalﬂ, 
BIS Papers, No 292, 2009) emphasise the effect 
on the private sector balance sheet Œ which is a mirror image of the effect on the central bank™s balance sheet. Other possibilities include 
the type of risk for the central bank™s balance sheet that results from its interventions (see Goodfriend, M., ﬁCentral Banking in the Credit 
Turmoil: An Assessment of Federal Reserve Practiceﬂ,
 Journal of Monetary Economics
, Vol. 58, No 1, 2011, pp. 1-12,); the locus of the 
central bank intervention, that is, the market targeted; the purpose of the intervention Œ what type of market imperfection the central bank 

is addressing Œ and hence the function it takes on by virtue of its intervention (e.g. market-maker of last resort); and the transmission 
channels of its policies. Chart 1 Central bank balance sheets since

Issue 4 / 2015of central bank liquidity to its counterparties in response to heightened demand induced by 
financial stress is considered in this article to be a passive deployment of the central bank balance 

sheet. This categorisation seems apt, since, in such cases, the consequences for the balance sheet 

of the monetary authority depend solely on the demand for central bank credit on the part of its 

counterparties. Active balance sheet policies, on the other hand, involve central bank measures 

that deliberately attempt to steer economic conditions by influencing specific financial market 

prices. The article identifies two types of active policy. ﬁCredit easingﬂ measures are targeted 

interventions that aim to influence credit spreads by altering the composition of the central 

bank balance sheet in order to improve the transmission of the desired monetary policy stance; 

and large-scale asset purchases (often termed ﬁquantitative easingﬂ) are intended to lower 
 long-term interest rates, when short-term nominal interest rates are at their effective lower bound, by 

increasing the size of the balance sheet, with the ultimate aim of achieving a comprehensive easing 

of the monetary policy stance. Finally, contingent balance sheet policies consist in a commitment 

by the central bank to use its balance sheet in certain ways, if specific circumstances materialise.2.2  P

PROVIDER OF FUNDING REASSURANCE IN RESPONSE TO FINANCIAL STRESSFinancial stress leads to increased demand for liquidity, which the central bank accommodates 

in an attempt to arrest the potentially disruptive deleveraging process that would otherwise 

ensue. In periods of systemic stress private financial intermediation becomes dysfunctional. In 
particular, the ability of the interbank market to efficiently (re)distribute central bank funds across 

counterparties diminishes or even breaks down completely owing to market fragmentation and 

precautionary ﬁhoardingﬂ of liquidity. In such cases, the central bank may need to provide reserves 

in excess of the ﬁregularﬂ liquidity needs arising from ﬁautonomous factorsﬂ (e.g. demand for 

banknotes) and, if applicable, from reserve requirements, for two main purposes: first, to stabilise 

the banking system in accordance with the traditional role of central banks as the ultimate provider 

of funding reassurance; and, second, to prevent an increase in short-term interest rates above levels 
consistent with the desired monetary policy stance. Many central banks implemented such policies as part of their response to the 2007-08 
financial crisis, particularly during the financial turmoil following the collapse of Lehman 
Brothers in September 2008. To alleviate severe tensions in the interbank money market, central 

banks engaged in a number of operations as the ultimate provider of funding reassurance, providing 

liquidity to their respective banking sectors. This type of central bank intervention was aimed at 

reducing interbank market spreads, but also helped to improve overall market functioning and to 

restore confidence in the economy. In fact, by stabilising short-term interest rates around the level 

of the operational target, an unwarranted tightening of the monetary policy stance was prevented.4 The central bank may also make longer-term liquidity available in order to provide funding 

reassurance to the banking system. Financial stress may affect not only the market for central bank 

reserves Œ the overnight market Œ but also term funding markets, including term money markets and 

the market for unsecured bank bonds. In response to such dislocations, central banks extended the 

maturity of their liquidity interventions beyond ﬁconventionalﬂ horizons. The availability of longer-
term liquidity provides counterparties with the funding to match the maturity of some of their assets 
4 Foreign currency swap lines between central banks Œ which increase the size of the central bank balance sheet as well Œ should also be 
seen in the context of funding reassurance: by making foreign currency liquidity available to their banking systems, central banks relieve 
funding pressures, in this case for foreign currency-denominated assets. 65ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015(offering funding reassurance). It thus insures banks against duration and rollover risk and thereby 
halts too rapid deleveraging. As a result, confidence effects in financial markets may be amplified. In 

addition, there may be important signalling effects, as this measure demonstrates the central bank™s 

determination to act as a liquidity backstop and ensure ﬁnormalﬂ conditions in the markets for term 

funding as well. The provision of funding reassurance to the central bank™s counterparties may be 

complemented by modifying other modalities of liquidity provision, for example, broadening the 

pool of eligible collateral. The ECB also switched its liquidity-providing operations to fixed rate full 

allotment tenders, which will remain in place until at least December 2016.The provision of term funding combines liquidity support and credit easing. By providing 
longer-term liquidity, the central bank influences conditions in the markets for term funding. 

Compared with the situation that would have prevailed if no policy interventions had been conducted, 

this lowers bank funding costs and credit spreads and is translated into looser financing conditions 

for final borrowers in the economy Œ safeguarding the transmission of the desired monetary policy 

stance. Therefore, this aspect of liquidity provision also has a credit easing dimension. 
Accommodating the banking system™s increased demand for liquidity and providing term 
funding will result in a larger central bank balance sheet
. When financial stress increases 

counterparties™ demand for reserves, the central bank has to accommodate this demand or forfeit 

the achievement of its operational target, which would blur the signal of its monetary policy stance. 

Stresses in funding markets, in turn, may interfere with the transmission of the intended stance. In 

both cases, the necessary increased provision of liquidity by the central bank increases the size of 

its assets: the monetary authority ﬁtakes intermediation onto its own balance sheetﬂ.5 The limited scope of liquidity support interventions may necessitate more active deployment 

of the central bank balance sheet. The overall efficacy of liquidity assistance policies is entirely 

dependent on counterparties™ decisions regarding whether and how much to borrow. While they 

may be sufficient to maintain market functioning and prevent financial dislocations from generating 

spillovers to the economy, they afford the central bank only limited control over broad monetary 

conditions. In particular, they may ultimately be insufficient to prevent bank deleveraging and the 

resulting drag on the economy stemming from restrictive credit conditions. In such cases, the central 

bank may need to take more active control of its balance sheet. Many major central banks Œ including 

the ECB Œ have made the transition from passive to active balance sheet policies in the course of 

the last few years, albeit at different speeds, as economic conditions necessitated increasingly tight 

control over the balance sheet in order to effectively steer the monetary policy stance. 
2.3 FROM PASSIVE TO ACTIVE CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEET POLICIES: CREDIT EASINGIn certain cases, providing liquidity elastically to the banking system may not be sufficient to 

remedy dysfunctional private financial intermediation. Liquidity provision by the central bank, 
however ample, is usually available only to a subset of market participants (namely the central 

bank™s counterparties); and even these participants may be reluctant to part with their liquidity 

to enter impaired markets in times of heightened risk aversion. Under such circumstances, direct 

central bank interventions may become necessary to improve the functioning of markets or market 

segments deemed crucial for the financing of the real economy. 5 The asset-side counterpart of the newly created reserves on the liability side is the credit granted to the central bank™s counterparties (if 
monetary policy is implemented through repo operations, for example) or securities held (if monetary policy is implemented through 
outright purchases and sales of government securities on the open market, for example).66ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015Under credit easing policies, the central bank may take a more active stance on determining 
the composition of the assets on its balance sheet, with a view to influencing market spreads 

that particularly impede transmission
. In the case of central bank interventions targeted at credit 

easing, it is the composition
 of the balance sheet™s asset side that is of primary importance, in 
the sense that the assets on the balance sheet reflect the monetary authority™s intention to ease 
conditions in specific markets.6 To do so, the monetary authority makes more active use of its balance sheet to improve upon or substitute for private financial intermediation, as well as to enable 

or enhance the transmission of the intended degree of accommodation. In this regard, credit easing 

policies are mainly aimed at improving financing conditions for the non-financial private sector. 

They achieve this by altering market spreads paid by certain borrowers and in certain markets, thus 

facilitating the transmission of the intended monetary policy stance in the presence of impairments 

to market functioning.Credit easing spans a diverse set of central bank interventions
. The measures taken by the 
central bank will depend on the specific characteristics of the impairment and the idiosyncrasies of 

the markets targeted, as well as more broadly on the financial structure of the economy and the set 

of tools available to the central bank. Credit easing measures may therefore include the provision 

of liquidity to financial market participants outside the usual set of central bank counterparties; the 

provision of liquidity Œ or collateral Œ against securities not normally accepted for use in monetary 

policy operations;
7 and outright purchases of assets. Thus, depending on the circumstances, credit 
easing interventions may, as noted above, have a great deal in common with passive liquidity 

support operations;
8 or may be more active, in the sense that the central bank itself calibrates the 
composition and possibly also the size of its assets. Targeted lending operations, such as those launched by the Bank of England and the 
ECB, also constitute credit easing measures, but have much in common with term funding 

interventions. The Bank of England in July 2012, and the ECB in September 2014, launched 

targeted schemes aimed at boosting bank lending to the non-financial private sector in order to 

enhance the transmission of monetary policy.
9 Such targeted lending operations differ from the 
measures already discussed insofar as they contain explicit incentives for banks to extend credit, by 

linking the terms of the provision of long-term funding to their lending performance. In substance, 

targeted lending operations are credit easing measures in that they aim to lower borrowing costs for 

the real economy and thus strengthen transmission Œ in this case by easing funding conditions for 

banks. At the same time, targeted lending measures have a great deal in common with passive term 

funding interventions Œ notably, the provision of central bank credit for a lengthy period of time and 

the dependence of lending volumes in these operations on counterparty demand. It is neither necessary nor sufficient for short-term nominal interest rates to have reached their lower bound in order for credit easing to have beneficial effects for the economy
. Rather, 6 In the case of ﬁpure credit easingﬂ, the central bank finances the acquisition of the assets in question through sales of other assets, changing 
the composition of the asset side of the balance sheet but leaving its size unaffected. The most prominent example of a pure credit easing 
policy is probably the Federal Reserve System™s Maturity Extension Program, in which longer-term Treasury securities were purchased in 
exchange for short-term ones.7 In such cases, central banks are sometimes said to have acted as ﬁmarket-makers of last resortﬂ (see, for example, Tucker, P., ﬁThe 
repertoire of official sector interventions in the financial system: last resort lending, market-making, and capitalﬂ, speech at the Bank of 
Japan 2009 International Conference, ﬁFinancial System and Monetary Policy: Implementationﬂ, May 2009). 8 One way to demarcate credit easing interventions from liquidity support operations is that the former involve direct interventions in 

ﬁunconventionalﬂ market segments Œ that is, transactions which, by virtue of the counterparty or asset class involved, are outside the usual 
modus operandi of the central bank Œ while the latter are confined to the central bank™s usual counterparties. 9 For more details, see Churm, R., A. Radia, J. Leake, S. Srinivasan and R. Whisker, ﬁThe Funding for Lending Schemeﬂ,

, Q4 2012; and the box entitled ﬁThe targeted longer-term refinancing operation of September 2014ﬂ,
 ECB Monthly 
Bulletin, October 2014.67ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015the usefulness of such policies depends on how important the targeted markets are for non-financial 
private sector financing conditions, as well as the degree of their impairment. For example, 

in response to credit market dislocations, the US Federal Reserve System established several 

facilities that extended temporary liquidity to key market segments (see ﬁterm lending facilitiesﬂ 

in Chart 2).10 These facilities made a substantial contribution to restoring market functioning while 
short-term nominal interest rates were well above their lower bound, as evidenced, for example, 

by the rapid decline in spreads in the commercial paper market following the Federal Reserve 

System™s interventions under the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (see Chart 3). However, the 

positive effects of credit easing interventions for the economy are likely to be even greater when 
short-term nominal interest rates have reached their lower bound.11The transmission of credit easing policies relies on direct pass-through and, if accompanied 

by substantial liquidity creation, portfolio rebalancing effects
. Credit easing measures are 

targeted at market segments that are closely linked to private non-financial sector borrowing 

conditions. This link may be direct Œ for example in the case of interventions that ease conditions 
10 These facilities mostly consisted in the provision of term liquidity through collateralised lending to Federal Reserve System counterparties 
or other market participants. Thus, they constitute ﬁhybridﬂ interventions that straddle term funding and credit easing. 11 See Curdia, V. and M. Woodford, ﬁThe Central-Bank Balance Sheet as an Instrument of Monetary Policyﬂ,

Issue 4 / 2015in commercial paper markets Œ or indirect, where the central bank™s action influences market 
prices of assets that, in turn, affect the price applied to the underlying credit Œ as in the case of 
interventions in markets for products securitised on loans to households or companies. Prominent 

examples of the latter are the Federal Reserve System™s purchases of mortgage-backed securities 

(MBS), and the ECB™s purchases of ABS and covered bonds. As the prices of such assets are bid 

up, banks respond to the market incentives by creating more saleable securities, and thus more 

loans to collateralise them, thereby expanding the volume and lowering the price of credit for final 

borrowers. Furthermore, as these interventions were financed through the creation of central bank 

reserves, the liquidity generated resulted in positive spillovers into other markets and securities Œ 

such portfolio rebalancing effects are discussed in more detail in the next section.Credit easing may thus also have a ﬁquantitativeﬂ impact on the central bank balance sheet, 
making it difficult in practice to draw a sharp distinction between credit easing measures 

and ﬁquantitativeﬂ policies
, as the former have tended to be financed by the creation of central bank reserves (e.g. the purchases of MBS in the United States, and the targeted longer-term 

refinancing operations (TLTROs), the ABS purchase programme and the third covered bond 

purchase programme in the euro area). Indeed, unsterilised credit easing interventions, if conducted 

on a sufficiently large scale, can have significant macroeconomic effects. For example, while the 

US Federal Reserve System™s purchases of MBS provided a catalyst for a drastic fall in spreads 

and a restoration of market functioning, their ultimate consequence was the stabilisation of the US 

housing market Œ with the concomitant macroeconomic benefits.12 2.4  A
CTIVE BALANCE SHEET POLICIES: LARGE-SCALE ASSET PURCHASES WITH SHORT-TERM NOMINAL 
INTEREST RATES AT THEIR LOWER BOUNDWith short-term nominal interest rates at their lower bound, central banks have embarked 

on large-scale asset purchases to ease the monetary policy stance further
. While credit easing 

policies also ease the monetary policy stance, simply easing conditions in particular markets may 

not suffice to achieve the degree of accommodation necessary for the central bank to fulfil its 

mandate. Rather, this may require a tool which, by design, will reliably deliver a broad easing of 

financial conditions. To achieve this objective, central banks have used large-scale asset purchases. 

They are thought to affect financial market prices via two main avenues:
13 the portfolio balance 
channel, as the liquidity generated through the asset purchases is used by investors to reallocate 

their portfolios, thus resulting in spillovers that affect prices in a multitude of market segments not 

addressed by central bank interventions; and the signalling channel, whereby the expansion in the 

size of the balance sheet is also a signal for the path of the policy rate in the future and hence for 
the future monetary policy stance. Through this channel, expectations of a looser monetary policy 

stance in the future will ease the current stance.The portfolio balance channel relies on imperfect substitutability of assets in private sector 
portfolios. In the presence of segmentation between different markets, for example, owing to 

imperfect substitutability of assets and limitations on arbitrage, changes in the net supply of a 

security in the market will affect the price of that asset as well as, potentially, the price of broadly 

similar instruments. For example, investors in government bonds may confine themselves to 
12 See, for example, Krishnamurthy, A. and A. Vissing-Jorgensen, ﬁThe Effects of Quantitative Easing on Interest Rates: Channels and 
Implications for Policyﬂ, 
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, autumn 2011, pp. 215Œ287; and Walentin, K., ﬁBusiness Cycle 
Implications of Mortgage Spreadsﬂ, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 67, 2014, pp. 62-77.13 This article only discusses the transmission of large-scale asset purchases to financial market prices. For a review of the transmission from 

asset prices to spending, see, for example, Bowdler, C. and A. Radia, ﬁUnconventional Monetary Policy: the Assessmentﬂ, 
Oxford Review of Economic Policy, Vol. 28, No 4, 2012, pp. 603-621.69ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015particular segments of the yield curve for institutional or other reasons. Central bank purchases that 
create a relative shortage of, for example, long-term bonds, will increase prices and lower yields. In 

addition, investors will seek to rebalance their portfolios away from ﬁcashﬂ (central bank reserves) 

and into riskier assets. To induce this investor response, the risk characteristics (i.e. the liquidity, 

duration or credit risk characteristics) of the assets purchased by the monetary authority must differ 

sufficiently from those of central bank reserves. For example, central bank purchases of riskless, 

liquid government securities against reserves can only be effective if they take duration risk out of 

investor portfolios Œ necessitating purchases of government debt with a long residual maturity. In 

this way, an expansion of the central bank™s balance sheet may provide additional accommodation 

through lower long-term yields and higher prices for a wide variety of assets, resulting in looser 

financial conditions. The portfolio balance channel is a function of the size of central bank interventions
. In principle, the portfolio balance channel is not tied to purchases of specific classes of assets. 

Rather, it emphasises the importance of quantities of securities for the pricing of assets.
14 This is because, in contrast to targeted central bank interventions, which have an immediate impact on 

credit conditions owing to the direct pass-through effect discussed above, the portfolio balance 
channel is less direct: it requires a spillover process whereby newly generated liquidity is passed 

from one market to another before it influences prices that are closely linked to broad credit 
conditions. Therefore, achieving meaningful macroeconomic effects Œ easing the monetary policy 

stance Œ requires substantial ﬁscalingﬂ of purchases. This in part explains the size of some asset 
purchase programmes, as well as the primary 
asset of choice for such programmes: 

government securities. Government bond 
markets, in addition to their key role in the 

pricing of a vast array of assets in the economy, 

are generally sufficiently large for central banks 

to be able to purchase the volumes necessary to 
generate a broad easing of financial conditions. 

For instance, the US Federal Reserve System, 

the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England 
held between 22% and 30% of total outstanding 
debt securities of their respective sovereigns 
at the height of their purchase programmes 

(see Chart 4). In this context, therefore, the size 

of the asset side of the central bank balance 

sheet becomes a proxy for the ﬁintensity of 

employmentﬂ of the portfolio balance channel 

and the resulting broad-based easing of financial 

conditions. Asset purchases may also enable a central 
bank to send a signal about the future stance 

of monetary policy
. It may wish to do so either

Issue 4 / 2015to provide additional stimulus or to better align market expectations with its intended monetary 
policy stance. In particular, the central bank may wish to indicate that it will keep interest rates low 

in the future to highlight its commitment to its mandate. Large-scale purchases of securities, such 

as long-term government bonds, in exchange for central bank reserves, replace long-duration assets 

in the portfolios of economic agents with liquidity. This may convince markets that the liquidity 

expansion will be long lasting, which, in turn, would influence the market pricing of term contracts. 

Put differently, withdrawing the large amounts of liquidity generated through the asset purchases in 

a short period of time may have adverse consequences for money market functioning and financial 

stability, making the central bank reluctant to be seen to reverse its course. By ﬁputting its money 

where its mouth isﬂ, the central bank underscores its commitment to achieving its goal. In this 

sense, the commitment to use the balance sheet can also be seen as buttressing the forward guidance 

on key policy rates that some central banks have provided.15 Successful signalling through the balance sheet involves both a size and a time dimension. 
Using the balance sheet to demonstrate commitment is only effective when a reversal of course 

would be sufficiently costly. Thus, a larger balance sheet can be a proxy for the cost to the central 

bank of reneging on its commitment to keep policy rates low. However, since signalling revolves 

around the future actions of the central bank, size is not the only way to state commitment Œ the 

time dimension is also important. The intentions of the central bank can thus also be signalled via 
 (1) the maturity of liquidity-providing operations (e.g. the ECB™s three-year longer-term refinancing 

operations); (2) the residual maturity of the assets purchased Œ since the longer duration of the bond 

portfolio implies a higher interest rate risk and therefore a potentially higher cost of reneging on 
its commitment to low policy rates; and (3) the length of the period during which operations or 

certain operational modalities are maintained (for example, the ECB™s current commitment to make 

liquidity available via fixed rate full allotment tenders until December 2016). In short, signalling 

involves information about both the current and future uses of the balance sheet. For example, the 

US Federal Reserve System has focused on changing ﬁ – market participants[™]
 – expectations concerning the entire path of the Federal Reserve System™s holdings of longer-term securitiesﬂ.16 2.5 C
ONTINGENT BALANCE SHEET POLICIESThe central bank may also commit to deploy its balance sheet if specific circumstances 
materialise. Such contingent use of the balance sheet is effectively a signalling mechanism. 
A prominent example of a contingent balance sheet policy is the ECB™s Outright Monetary 

Transactions (OMTs). In the case of the OMTs, the ECB committed to intervene in government 

bond markets to address distortions arising from the presence of unwarranted redenomination risks 

in order to strengthen the transmission mechanism.17 More broadly, however, contingent balance 
sheet policies have been employed by central banks to provide information about the duration of 

purchase programmes that are subject to conditionality. Two prominent examples of this latter 

use of contingent balance sheet communication are the so-called LSAP-3 announcement by the 

Federal Reserve System in September 2012 and the ECB communication which clarified that, 

under its expanded asset purchase programme, ﬁ[p]urchases are intended to run until the end of 15 Indeed, mainstream asset pricing theory suggests that central bank asset purchases are ineffective when interest rates are at the lower 
bound, and only forward guidance can provide monetary stimulus. See Eggertson, G. and M. Woodford, ﬁThe Zero Bound on Interest 
Rates and Optimal Monetary Policyﬂ, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No 1, 2003, pp. 139-211.16 Yellen, J., ﬁChallenges Confronting Monetary Policyﬂ, speech at the 2013 National Association for Business Economics Policy 
Conference, Washington DC, 4 March 2013.17 In monetary policy frameworks that involve at least some active management of the exchange rate, central bank pledges to intervene in 

foreign exchange markets may also constitute contingent balance sheet policies. The commitment is to buy or sell foreign currency; the 
contingency is usually related to the value of the domestic currency reaching certain levels in foreign exchange markets.71ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015September 2016 and, in any case, until [the Governing Council] see[s] a sustained adjustment in 
the path of inflation that is consistent with [its] aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 

2% over the medium termﬂ. The contingency for triggering such a use of the central bank balance 

sheet is usually current and future macroeconomic conditions (for example, the inflation outlook) in 

relation to the central bank™s goals.3 T
HE EUROSYSTEM BALANCE SHEET 
Since the start of the crisis the ECB has taken several unconventional measures that have 

altered both the size and composition of the Eurosystem balance sheet in pursuit of price 

stability. Over the recent period the nature of these measures has changed and in part resembles the 
actions of other major central banks. The size and composition of the Eurosystem balance sheet has 

evolved over time on the basis of the policy purpose and the types of instrument used. In the initial stages of the crisis monetary policy focused on maintaining very short-term interest rates in line with the intended monetary policy stance through liquidity support 
measures. With the outbreak of the tensions in money markets, the ECB provided substantial 
liquidity support to the euro area banking system. In line with the classical notion of the central 

bank™s role as the ultimate provider of funding reassurance, the short-term liquidity support aimed 

to prevent disruption to money market activity from spreading further and creating the conditions 

for a generalised banking panic and a phase of disorderly deleveraging. Ultimately, this was to 

ensure an efficient transmission of changes in money market conditions to other financial variables 

(reflecting the predominantly bank-based financing structure of the euro area economy), and, hence, 

to the real economy and to inflation.Such measures included liquidity-providing operations of various maturities and the use of 
fixed rate full allotment tenders in refinancing operations. The ECB increased both the size and 

parameters of its liquidity-providing operations, particularly after the intensification of the crisis 

following the default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Most notably, the ECB started to 

provide unlimited funding to banks, conducting its refinancing operations as fixed rate full allotment 

tenders, which satisfies fully banks™ demand for central bank liquidity against adequate collateral.
18 Reflecting the increased demand for liquidity and the full allotment procedure that increased the 

intermediation role of the Eurosystem, there was a gradual, passive increase in the Eurosystem 

balance sheet (see the box).During the ensuing crisis the ECB had recourse to a set of primarily bank-based measures to 
enhance the flow of credit. To counter tensions in specific public and private sector debt markets, 

which were hampering the transmission of monetary policy, a number of measures were taken with 
a more targeted focus to support financial conditions and market functioning in those markets. The 

aim was primarily to enhance the transmission of a given stance of monetary policy, as reflected 

in the policy interest rates and very short-term money market rates, through recourse to a set of 
measures that supported credit provision to the real economy. These measures comprised funding 

operations with a very long duration, as well as more active use of the Eurosystem balance sheet to 

target specific public and private sector market segments.18 Note that the ECB modified its collateral framework several times to ensure adequate access of counterparties to its funding facilities. 
Moreover, in order to address euro area banks™ need to fund their foreign currency-denominated assets, the Eurosystem provided liquidity 
in foreign currencies, most notably in US dollars.72ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015Three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) were introduced to provide funding 
reassurance.19 The two LTROs conducted in December 2011 and February 2012 provided funding 
reassurance for banks for a significant period of time when refinancing via the usual bank funding 

sources was potentially impaired. While in principle a liquidity support measure, it succeeded in 

halting excessively rapid rates of deleveraging and thus supported the provision of credit to the real 

economy. With banks™ participation amounting to •521 billion in net terms, the balance sheet of the 

Eurosystem increased significantly and the maturity of its assets lengthened (see the box). The ECB also undertook outright purchases targeting malfunctioning market segments that 
impaired the transmission of monetary policy, making more active use of its balance sheet
. 
Given the importance of covered bonds as a major source of funding for banks in many parts of 

the euro area to refinance loans to the public and private sectors, in June 2009 the ECB started to 

purchase euro-denominated covered bonds under two covered bond purchase programmes (CBPP1 

and CBPP2). Similarly, when tensions arose in euro area government bond markets, which play 

an important role in the pricing of other financial assets and loans to the real economy, thereby 

hampering the transmission of the ECB™s monetary policy stance, the ECB purchased government 
bonds in the context of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP).20 Accumulated SMP purchases 
at their height amounted to •220 billion, while the size of CBPP1 and CBPP2 reached •60 billion 

and •16 billion respectively. Moreover, in August 2012 the ECB announced its intention to purchase government bonds in 
secondary markets if certain conditions were met Œ a contingent balance sheet policy
. It could 

address severe distortions in these markets, originating in particular from fears of the reversibility 

of the euro, through OMTs.21 This programme commits the ECB to using the Eurosystem balance 
sheet to overcome this distortion, provided certain conditions are fulfilled.22 19 Among the relevant empirical studies are Peersman, G., ﬁMacroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policy in the euro areaﬂ,

at the Zero Lower Bound: A Cross-Country Analysisﬂ, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 46(4), pp. 615-642.20 The targeted nature of the measure (that aimed to repair impaired monetary policy transmission rather than to alter the existing stance of 
monetary policy) was underlined by the full sterilisation of the SMP liquidity injected. 21 For further details, see the press release on the technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions published by the ECB on 
 6 September 2012.22 The ECB has also provided forward guidance since July 2013, as discussed in the article entitled ﬁThe ECB™s forward guidanceﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin, ECB, April 2014.BOX RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EUROSYSTEM BALANCE SHEET The size and composition of the Eurosystem balance sheet has changed significantly over 
recent years as a result of unconventional monetary policy operations. This box provides 
information on developments in the Eurosystem balance sheet observed since the latter half of 

2011 from a market operations perspective.1 1 Information on prior developments in the Eurosystem balance sheet can be found, for example, in the article entitled ﬁThe ECB™s 
 non-standard measures Œ impact and phasing-outﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin, ECB, July 2011; and the article entitled ﬁRecent developments 
in the balance sheets of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of Japanﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, October 2009.73ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015Developments on the asset side of the Eurosystem balance sheetMonetary policy tools and investment portfolios are the main items on the asset side. 
Monetary policy tools include short and long-term repo operations, the marginal lending facility 
and outright purchase operations. Investment portfolios include domestic as well as foreign 
assets. The Eurosystem™s investment portfolios are not used for the implementation of monetary 

policy, except the foreign reserves of the ECB, which are available for possible foreign exchange 

interventions. The Eurosystem™s investment portfolios are subject to restrictions decided upon 

by the ECB, such as maximum size limits, in order to ensure that they do not interfere with the 

implementation of the single monetary policy. In addition, the Eurosystem has rules restricting 

foreign reserve transactions that are not carried out for policy purposes, in order to ensure 

consistency with the exchange rate and monetary policies.2Monetary policy tools have been the main drivers of the recent significant changes in the size 

and composition of the Eurosystem balance sheet. In particular, as a result of the two three-year 

longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) conducted in December 2011 and February 2012, the 

size of the balance sheet expanded significantly. From early 2013 to September 2014 the size of the 

balance sheet progressively declined, as a result of the option given to banks to repay the three-year 

LTROs on a weekly basis. The improvement in bank funding conditions reduced banks™ need to 

hold liquidity buffers. Since September 2014 the size of the balance sheet has halted its decline and 

started to increase again, owing to the launch of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations 

(TLTROs) and the asset purchase programmes Œ i.e. the third covered bond purchase programme 

(CBPP3), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP) and the public sector purchase 

programme (PSPP). Meanwhile, investment portfolios have been relatively stable, with some 

fluctuations in net foreign assets mainly owing to exchange rate effects.

Issue 4 / 2015In order to operate monetary policy effectively and to alleviate collateral constraints on its 
eligible counterparties, the Eurosystem has altered and expanded its eligibility criteria for 

the assets it accepts as collateral for its credit operations
.3 At the same time, it has continued to regularly review its risk control measures to ensure that its balance sheet continues to be 

protected. Such measures include requiring counterparties to submit adequate collateral, pricing 

the submitted collateral on a daily basis and applying appropriate collateral valuation haircuts 

and mark-downs.4 Developments on the liability side of the Eurosystem balance sheet On the liability side, monetary policy tools and autonomous factors are the two main items. Monetary policy tools include the current accounts, the deposit facility and other liquidity-absorbing 

tools. The deposit facility increased substantially after the launch of the two three-year LTROs. The 

increase was driven by funding needs and precautionary liquidity demand by counterparties. After 

the ECB lowered the deposit facility rate to zero in July 2012, counterparties™ liquidity holdings 

shifted in part from the deposit facility to the current accounts, because the remuneration of the 

deposit facility was identical to the remuneration of current account holdings over and above the 

minimum reserve requirements. As regards other liquidity-absorbing tools, the liquidity provided 

through the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) was fully sterilised through weekly liquidity-
absorbing operations until June 2014, to leave central bank liquidity conditions unaffected by the 

SMP. The Eurosystem has foreign liabilities, as the US-dollar liquidity-providing operations have 

been implemented through swap arrangements with the US Federal Reserve System.

deposits and residual items over which central banks have little or no control. Government 

deposits have decreased recently since the negative deposit facility interest rate was introduced in 

June 2014, and this rate has also been applied to government deposits held with the Eurosystem 

that exceed a certain threshold.5 5 See the Guideline of the ECB of 5 June 2014 amending Guideline ECB/2014/9 on domestic asset and liability management operations 
by the national central banks (ECB/2014/22).Against a backdrop of subdued inflation and weak money and credit growth, in 2014 the 
ECB introduced additional credit easing policies in order to improve transmission. The 
muted recovery that had begun in 2013 did not accelerate as initially expected. Monetary growth 

remained subdued and credit continued to contract, although the pace gradually slowed. Against 

this background, in June and September 2014 the ECB announced the launch of the TLTROs and 
purchases of ABS and covered bonds, while it also reduced the key policy interest rates to their 

lower bound. This package of measures was aimed at enhancing the transmission of monetary 

policy as well as providing further monetary accommodation. In particular, by bringing the average 

borrowing costs for households and firms down to levels that were more consistent with the 
intended policy stance, the measures aimed to support lending to the real economy.TLTROs were conducted to support bank lending to
 the non-financial private sector (excluding loans to households for house purchase).23 The TLTROs provided long-term funding 
at attractive terms and conditions for up to four years at the time of the launch of the operations 
for all banks that met certain benchmarks applicable to their lending to the real economy. The 

choice of this measure reflected the predominantly bank-based financing structure of the euro 

area economy and the significance of weak bank lending as a factor hampering the recovery. By 

providing incentives for banks to lend to the real economy, the TLTROs were aimed at enhancing 

monetary policy transmission. Improved funding conditions for banks should contribute to easing 

credit conditions and stimulating credit creation.24 Purchases under the third purchase programme for covered bonds (CBPP3) and the ABS 

purchase programme (ABSPP) began in October and November 2014 respectively. 
They further enhanced the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and supported the 

provision of credit to the real economy. The purchases in the ABS and covered bond markets reflect 

the role of these instruments in facilitating new credit flows to the economy. In particular, there is 

a close link between the interest rate spreads at which ABS and covered bonds are traded and the 

lending rates which banks apply to the underlying loans.
 Purchases should therefore contribute to 
lower interest rates on the targeted securities (through the price effect) which should be passed on 

to the rates on the underlying loans to the private sector (via
 the pass-through effect), improving 
lending conditions and creating room for banks to extend more credit.These credit easing measures were supplemented by a quantitative balance sheet orientation, marking a major change in the ECB™s monetary policy communication. Adding an indication 
in the ECB™s communication of the quantity of purchases was deemed essential in view of the 

further worsening of the inflation outlook that had taken place. Uncertainty about asset purchases 

as an instrument to enhance the accommodative monetary policy stance is inherently higher 
23 See the press release on measures to enhance the monetary policy transmission mechanism published by the ECB on 5 June 2014.
24 The spread on the main refinancing operations, initially set at 10 basis points, was reduced to zero in January 2015 for the six TLTRO 
operations that then remained.76ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015compared with uncertainty about changes in interest rates. The purchase programmes for ABS and 
covered bonds have a high potential pass-through per unit of purchase, given that both markets 

were impaired, but the precise effects are difficult to anticipate. These purchases will lower funding 

costs for banks, which should be passed on to households and non-financial corporations seeking 

bank financing, and will also generate broader macroeconomic spillovers if the liquidity injection 

is sizeable. By adding a quantitative dimension to its communication, the ECB signalled that a 

significant purchase volume was essential to arrive at a meaningful macroeconomic effect.Following a further deterioration in the inflation outlook, and credit easing measures failing to 
deliver the necessary degree of accommodation, in January 2015 the ECB decided to purchase 

public sector securities. This programme focuses on secondary market purchases of investment-grade 

debt instruments issued by euro area governments and agencies or international and supranational 

institutions. Together with CBPP3 and the ABSPP, the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) 

constitutes the expanded asset purchase programme. Purchases under the expanded asset purchase 

programme started in March 2015 and amount to •60 billion per month.25 They are intended 
to be carried out until the end of September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until a 
 sustained adjustment is seen in the path of inflation consistent with the aim of achieving inflation rates 

below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In May 2015 purchases of public sector securities 

stood below 2% of euro area total outstanding government debt. 
The unconventional measures taken since June 2014, including both credit easing and large-scale asset purchases to further ease the monetary policy stance when policy rates are 

constrained by the lower bound, complete the shift from a passive to an active balance sheet 
policy. Purchases of public sector securities will mainly rely on the portfolio rebalancing effect and 

on the signalling effect. Both effects have a size dimension, while successful signalling through 

the balance sheet also involves a time dimension. The significant size of the monthly purchases, 

combined with an intended end-point that could be extended if the sustainable achievement of price 

stability calls for it, should ensure a significant contribution of the monetary impulse, as will be 

reflected in the increase in the Eurosystem balance sheet. The ultimate indicator of the success of the recent programmes and operations is whether 
they achieve inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. While it is too early 

to assess their full contribution to that goal, given time lags in the transmission of the monetary 

accommodation, a number of early indicators of financing conditions and confidence have produced 

positive signals. Broad financial conditions had already started to improve well before the expanded 

asset purchase programme was announced, as market participants had anticipated the measure, 

following announcements by the Governing Council that it stood ready to take additional measures 

if required. Euro area bond yields have declined since December 2014 across all instruments, 

maturities and issuers and, in many cases, have reached new historical lows. Given a slight upward 

tendency in medium-term inflation expectations, real interest rates have decreased further. Spreads 

on investment-grade corporate bonds have continued their decline and stock prices have increased 

significantly. Reflecting in part the further decoupling of euro area and US government bond yields, 

the euro exchange rate has weakened significantly.The favourable developments in financial markets have started to spill over to the real economy. Lower bank funding costs are being gradually passed on to the cost of external finance 
25 For more details, see the box entitled ﬁThe Governing Council™s expanded asset purchase programmeﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin, ECB,  January 2015.77ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015for the non-financial private sector, aided by the comprehensive assessment of the balance sheets of 
the main euro area banks conducted in 2014 in preparation for the Single Supervisory Mechanism. 

Yields on unsecured bank bonds declined to historical lows in the fourth quarter of 2014. This 

was accompanied by a substantial fall in composite bank lending rates for households and 
 non-financial corporations. The nominal cost of non-bank external finance for euro area 
 non-financial corporations continued to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in the first few 

months of 2015, as a result of a further decline in the cost of both market-based debt and equity. 4 CONCLUSIONS 
In recent years the central bank balance sheet Œ its size and composition Œ has emerged as 

a flexible instrument of monetary policy. Since the start of the global financial crisis monetary 

authorities have increasingly moved beyond their traditional operating procedures to make ever 

more intensive use of the central bank balance sheet as a tool of policy. For many jurisdictions, the 

use of the central bank balance sheet over time has marked a transition from reactive, or passive, 

on-demand liquidity provision with limited scope to affect broad financial conditions, to active, 

or controlled deployment in an effort to affect broad financial conditions. Thus, in addition to 

monetary authorities™ traditional role as the ultimate provider of funding reassurance in response 

to financial stress, the central bank balance sheet has also been used to address impairments in 

the transmission of monetary policy, as well as to provide policy accommodation when short-term 

nominal interest rates are at their effective lower bound. In short, the central bank balance sheet has 

proven a flexible tool to address a variety of policy needs. However, given that the central bank balance sheet is a very flexible policy instrument, there is 
an important caveat: a unit of liquidity may have very different effects in a given jurisdiction over 

time, as well as across jurisdictions at a specific point in time. In a given economy, the monetary 

authority may use the balance sheet to achieve different effects over time, depending on the 

circumstances, as indeed has been the case in recent years. Moreover, differences in economic and 

financial structures, as well as operating procedures, will necessitate different types of intervention 

across economies in terms of the size and composition of the balance sheet. These considerations 

caution against overly simplistic comparisons of central bank balance sheets. In recent years the ECB has used the Eurosystem balance sheet extensively in pursuit of its price 
stability mandate. The use of the Eurosystem balance sheet has followed a similar trajectory to that 

seen in other jurisdictions. The increased liquidity provision in the initial stages of the financial crisis 

(through an increase in the allotment in refinancing operations) was followed by term lending and 

funding reassurance (through longer-term refinancing operations carried out as fixed rate full allotment 

tender procedures), which were, in turn, followed by measures to strengthen transmission (the SMP, 

TLTROs, CBPP1 and CBPP2). The ECB has recently launched a further purchase programme for 

covered bonds and new programmes for ABS and public sector securities. These programmes are 

designed to strengthen the pass-through to the real economy and provide a further broad easing of the 

monetary policy stance with short-term nominal interest rates at their effective lower bound. 
Outright asset purchases signal the determination of the ECB to achieve its primary 
objective, enhancing signalling effects and resulting in portfolio rebalancing effects that spread 
to assets across the board. This should contribute to improving lending and economic growth and, 

ultimately, to bringing about a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with the aim 

of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. 78ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015IMF SURVEILLANCE OF THE EURO AREA 
 AND ITS MEMBER COUNTRIESIMF surveillance encompasses the monitoring of the economic and financial policies of its member 
countries and the global economy as well as the identification of possible risks to stability and the 

provision of advice on necessary policy adjustments. In recent years, the Fund has significantly 

improved its surveillance in general, including of the euro area and its constituent countries. It
 has 
responded to the shortcomings exposed by the crisis in global financial markets and in some euro 

area countries with several new initiatives and the strengthening of practices in key areas. These 

changes are the result of critical reflection exercises by the IMF, of which the
 2011 review of 
IMF surveillance was arguably the most pivotal. At the same time, there is still scope for further 

enhancing IMF surveillance and for introducing additional changes to make it more effective 

and better tailored to the circumstances of the relevant economies, not least in view of the recent 

significant adjustments to the policy framework within the EU/euro area itself. The aim of this article is to take stock of IMF surveillance of the euro area and its member countries 
following recent changes. In so doing, it also explores the interplay between the EU and IMF 

surveillance frameworks for the euro area. Since the focus is on the IMF™s regular surveillance 

activities, it does not cover surveillance in the context of lending programmes. 1 INTRODUCTIONThe IMF has taken a number of steps in recent years to strengthen its surveillance framework 

and toolkit. Its own triennial surveillance reviews (TSR) have been instrumental in that process. 

The 2011 TSR, as the first comprehensive review after the start of the global financial crisis, 

was particularly important.
1 It identified key priorities, which IMF staff have since sought to 
operationalise. These concerned (i) interconnectedness; (ii) risk assessment; (iii) financial stability; 

(iv) external stability; and (v) traction. In addition, the legal basis for surveillance was updated 

in 2012 with the adoption of the Integrated Surveillance Decision (ISD), which enables the IMF 

to assess all policies that are relevant for a member™s external and domestic stability and to take 

into account inward and outward spillovers and cross-country policy interactions. The adoption of 

a Financial Surveillance Strategy was also an important step towards improving risk identification 

and policy analysis in the financial sector and fostering an integrated view of financial sector risks 

in products and instruments.In 2014 the IMF conducted its latest TSR2, which was structured around three themes:  (i) integrating and deepening risk and spillover analysis; (ii) more tailored and expert policy 
advice; and (iii) achieving a greater impact.
 Regarding the first theme, the review found that 

there was still significant scope to explore synergies between bilateral and multilateral surveillance. 

Moreover, IMF staff saw a need to deepen the understanding of how risks map across countries and 
how spillovers spread across sectors. As to the second theme, attention was drawn to the importance 

of tailoring advice to country circumstances. Also, to enhance policy advice, Fund staff saw merit 

in continuing to build on the IMF™s understanding of macroprudential policy and highlighting 

the implications of macro-critical structural reforms in line with its mandate. Turning to the third 

theme, staff underlined the need for more client-focused and candid communication.1 The findings of the report by the IMF™s Independent Evaluation Office entitled ﬁIMF Performance in the Run-Up to the Global Economic 
and Financial Crisisﬂ (2011) are also reflected in the 2011 TSR. 2 International Monetary Fund (IMF), ﬁ2014 Triennial Surveillance Review: Overview Paperﬂ, IMF, Washington, D.C.
79ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015Drawing on a recent report by the Task Force on IMF Issues of the International 
Relations Committee of the European System of Central Banks3, this article looks into 
how IMF surveillance of the euro area and its constituent countries has changed since the 

pivotal 2011 TSR. Section 2 describes the IMF framework for surveying the euro area and its 
members and discusses how it interacts with the EU/euro area™s own surveillance framework, 

which has also been substantially reformed in the recent past. Section
 3 reviews the performance 
of the Fund™s post-crisis surveillance of the euro area and its member countries in the priority areas 

mentioned above. It also covers the implications of European banking union for IMF surveillance. 

Section 4 looks at the specificities of IMF surveillance of the policy framework of EMU, and 

Section 5 concludes. 2 THE FRAMEWORK OF IMF SURVEILLANCE OF THE EURO AREA AND ITS MEMBER COUNTRIES2.1 A NEW LEGAL FRAMEWORKA new legal framework for IMF surveillance was put in place with the adoption of the 

Integrated Surveillance Decision in
 2012. The legal basis for Fund surveillance is set out in Article 
IV of the IMF™s Articles of Agreement, which distinguishes between bilateral and multilateral 

surveillance.4 The ISD updated the surveillance framework by enabling the IMF to engage more 
effectively with members on their domestic economic and financial policies and by making Article 

IV bilateral consultations a vehicle for multilateral surveillance as well. In particular, the ISD 

allows the IMF to discuss with its members the full range of spillovers from their policies when 

these may have a significant impact on global stability.While the ISD also provides the basis for better surveillance of monetary unions, the paragraph 
in the ISD concerning currency unions changed little compared with the
 2007 Decision on 
the Bilateral Surveillance over Members™ Policies.
 The text has been improved by placing emphasis on ensuring not only the balance of payments stability of the union, but also its domestic 

stability. Helpfully, the ISD has been translated into operational guidance on the surveillance of 

currency unions in which staff are explicitly advised to assess the extent to which economic and 

financial polices at the level of the currency union (exchange rate, monetary, fiscal and financial 

sector policies) are promoting the union™s domestic and balance of payments stability and global 

stability. Despite the fact that EU/EMU decision-making structures have been strengthened, 

the legal basis remains constrained by the country-based membership of the IMF. The ISD repeats 

the 2007 Decision in explicitly noting that members of currency unions ﬁremain subject to all 
of their obligations under Article IV section
 1, and accordingly, each member is accountable for 
those policies that are conducted by union level institutions on its behalfﬂ (ISD, paragraph
 8). This 
corresponds to the fact that countries themselves retain all the resulting rights and obligations of 
IMF membership, even though the institutional and governance set up is different for euro area 

countries in that there is an independent central bank and joint decision-making in some policy 

areas. None of the European institutions or fora are members of the IMF, and their cooperation with 

the Fund is not mandatory. The European Central Bank was granted observer status under IMF 
3 Task Force on IMF Issues of the International Relations Committee of the European System of Central Banks, ﬁIMF Surveillance in 
Europeﬂ, Occasional Paper Series, No 158, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, January 2015. 4 Article IV, Section 1 provides that each member shall ﬁundertake to collaborate with the Fund and other members to assure orderly 
exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange ratesﬂ. The Fund is directed to oversee the compliance of each 
member with its obligations, and give heightened scrutiny to members™ exchange rate policies. Section 3(a) requires the Fund to ﬁoversee 

the international monetary system in order to ensure its effective operationﬂ and forms the basis for the Fund™s multilateral surveillance.80ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015Decision No
 11875-99/1 of 21 December 1998 and is accordingly permitted to participate in IMF 
Executive Board meetings on specified topics and topics relevant to the mandate of the ECB.5 2.2  SURVEILLANCE IN PRACTICE: BILATERAL, REGIONAL AND MULTILATERALThe IMF conducts consultations with individual euro area countries (resulting in country 
reports covering national policies), as well as with the authorities representing the euro area 

as a whole (resulting in a report on euro area policies). It also conducts a Financial Sector 
Assessment Programme (FSAP) every five years for those euro area members with systemic 

financial systems
6, and on request for the other euro area countries. In addition, the first FSAP for 
the European Union was concluded in March 2013.The modalities for conducting IMF surveillance within the euro area were formalised with 
the introduction of the euro.7 For individual euro area countries, there were no changes to the 
annual consultation under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement. As it is not a member of the 

IMF, the euro area as a whole does not have an Article IV consultation in its own right. Instead, 

IMF staff semi-annually exchange views with staff of the ECB, the European Commission and 

other European institutions and bodies and draw up an annual report on euro area policies to 
complement and better inform the Article IV consultations with individual euro area countries (not 

the other way round). Thus, in practice, euro area surveillance follows a dual track, with a separate 

surveillance exercise for the union, coordinated with national Article IV surveillance. This results 

in consultations with the 19 individual euro area members plus a consultation on the policies of the 

ECB and the European Commission, leading to 20 annual reports in total. In addition, as part of its 
multilateral surveillance, the IMF analyses developments in the euro area in its World Economic 

Outlook (WEO), Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) and Fiscal Monitor. The Fund has also 

produced annual Spillover Reports and External Sector Reports since
 2011 and 2012 respectively, 
which include a focus on the euro area as well as key euro area countries. 2.3  T
HE EU/EURO AREA AND IMF SURVEILLANCE FRAMEWORKS: POTENTIAL SCOPE FOR TENSIONS 
 AND CROSS-FERTILISATIONThe recent crisis has also led to successive reforms of the surveillance framework of the EU and 

the euro area.
 New surveillance systems for EU Member States™ budgetary and economic policies, as 

well as a new financial supervisory architecture mainly affecting euro area countries, have been put in 

place.8 A clear calendar has been established in the context of the European Semester, during which 
policy recommendations are formulated at the European level and addressed to the national level. 
The reinforced EU surveillance framework has thus far not led to any specific changes in the 
way the IMF conducts its surveillance of EU Member States/euro area countries, although 

such an avenue could be considered.
 On the one hand, the interplay between the reinforced 

EU surveillance frameworks and those of the IMF might entail specific challenges for both EU 

Member States/euro area countries and the IMF going forward. Firstly, with economic governance 
5 While the ECB holds observer status at meetings of the IMF Executive Board, both the ECB and the European Commission hold observer 
status on the International Monetary and Financial Committee.6 Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain.
7 IMF Decision No 12846-(98/125) and IMF Decision No 12899-(02/119), as amended by IMF Decision No 14062-(08/15).
8 See, for example, the article entitled ﬁA fiscal compact for a stronger Economic and Monetary Unionﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin, ECB, May 2012, and the box entitled ﬁThe ‚two-pack™ regulations to strengthen economic governance in the euro areaﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin, ECB, April 2013. With regard to banking union, see the Financial Stability Review, ECB, May 2014. 81ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015increasingly exercised at different levels (national, joint national, euro area and EU), the way 
in which policy formulation is being shaped for euro area countries has changed. This requires 

the IMF to internalise these new EU/euro area processes properly in its surveillance, and may 

complicate its surveillance or even pose challenges to the consistency between assessments made 

in national and euro area surveillance reports. Secondly, there are differences in the scope, focus, 

enforcement mechanisms and traction of the two surveillance frameworks. Although IMF country 

surveillance is constantly ongoing, the key focal point is the annual Article IV report Œ a once-yearly 
 exercise of a cooperative nature Œ and the Fund™s leverage is based on the strength of its arguments, 

peer pressure and, on occasion, its potential impact on financial markets. By comparison, EU 

surveillance is a continuous process with regular formal meetings, embedded in the European 

Semester, including monitoring of implementation in the second semester of the year and with 

legally binding procedures for dealing with fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances. In addition, its 

coverage extends further into the structural policy domain.IMF surveillance usually results in broader, more strategic policy guidance, in contrast 
with the more detailed country-specific recommendations which the EU makes under 

its surveillance calendar.
 Complications may arise if, owing to differences in views on the 

effectiveness of certain policy tools in given circumstances, contrasting policy recommendations 

are made. Furthermore, IMF policy advice may not always be strictly in line with prevailing EU 

rules if these rules are deemed wanting by IMF staff, yet individual EU Member States/euro area 

countries may legally not be in a position to disregard those rules and follow the IMF™s advice. 

On the other hand, the IMF and EU surveillance frameworks can also complement each other. In 

fact, the IMF can play a helpful role as an independent, trusted external adviser. The Fund has a 

breadth of expertise, a wealth of experience across countries and over time, and an approach that 

is driven first and foremost by economic analysis, with fewer institutional constraints. As such, it 

has an important role to play in providing an external perspective in addition to the European view 

from within. IMF recommendations can provide an impetus for euro area countries to collectively 

deliberate and seek, if warranted, a change in national or common policies.3 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE IMF SURVEILLANCE FRAMEWORKOverall, the IMF has made good progress in implementing the new surveillance framework both 

in general and in the euro area, although there is scope for further improvement. Reviewing the 
Article IV reports drawn up on euro area countries in
 2013 and 2014, this section looks at whether the 
IMF has effectively implemented changes to its surveillance framework in four of the five priority 

areas identified in the
 2011 TSR for the euro area: (i) interconnectedness, (ii) risk assessment, 
 (iii) financial stability and (iv) traction. Moreover, it covers the implications of European banking 

union for IMF surveillance of the euro area and its constituent countries.3.1 INTERCONNECTEDNESS3.1.1 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL LINKAGESFor individual euro area countries, national surveillance is now far better informed by 
regional surveillance.
 Analyses in national Article IV and Financial System Stability Assessment 
(FSSA) reports are systematically informed by, and put into the context of, the main economic and 

financial developments within the euro area as a whole. 82ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015In multilateral reports such as the WEO and the GFSR, thematic chapters or sections usually 
provide in-depth analysis of specific issues such as the banking, corporate and sovereign 
nexus. However, in past reports, the identification of key vulnerabilities and challenges for the 

euro area focused mainly on a narrow selection of countries, with the discussion of developments 

confined to the interaction between ﬁcoreﬂ and ﬁstressedﬂ countries. It may also be worth considering whether to strengthen the analysis of spillovers to better 
understand the impact of shocks and policy decisions, building on country reports.
 This may 

mean going further than the current general summing up of spillovers within the euro area and 

better integrating the analysis carried out in the context of country surveillance into monetary union 

surveillance products. Building on the example of recent Spillover Reports, the provision of more 

in-depth analysis of positive inward spillovers, in addition to the negative shocks most commonly 

examined in country reports, could be considered. 3.1.2 P
OLICY LINKAGESImprovements have been made in the treatment of policy interconnectedness within the 

euro area. For example, policy advice to countries appears to be more intrinsically linked to the 

main economic and financial developments in the euro area and is more cognisant of the euro area 

economic and financial policy framework. Staff now clearly distinguish between policies within the 

field of competence of European authorities (e.g. monetary policy), those under the responsibility 

of national governments (e.g. structural reforms to boost competitiveness) and those within a given 

EU framework (e.g. the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)). Similarly, policy advice on financial 

issues now takes into account developments in the EU/euro area and at the national level in the 

context of a profound reshaping of the European supervisory architecture.Mapping the main policy linkages between euro area countries is indeed important.
 This can take the form of holding more in-depth discussions with authorities on how euro area membership 

affects vulnerabilities and policy options, including, e.g., the case of euro area monetary policy 

coping with different national macroeconomic conditions and the role of national macro prudential 

policies within the euro area. Moreover, findings under the EU Macroeconomic Imbalances 

Procedure could be juxtaposed with the IMF™s own assessment of extra- and intra-euro area 

imbalances. In addition, authorities could be provided with better ﬁmapsﬂ of financial and real 

linkages within the euro area. Without prejudice to the domestic stability objective, the policy 

options suggested to authorities could be accompanied by information on the outward spillovers 

they potentially generate. There may be merit in providing stronger and more clearly formulated policy 
recommendations on structural reforms that are macro-critical, consistent with the Fund™s 

mandate in this policy area, including their estimated impact.
 Discussions on these issues 

should be more systematic when they are of critical importance for the external balance of a country, 

which more often tends to be the case for countries participating in a monetary union. These policy 

recommendations could also build on cross-country analysis. The Fund could make better use of 

insights from other organisations, especially the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 

Development. Furthermore, it could try to quantify the effects of structural reforms in terms of their 
impact on economic growth and, to the extent possible, both the euro area™s external and internal 

balances, while recognising the difficulties of such an exercise (including, not least, data, technical 

and resource constraints). This would follow up on the work that the IMF has already started in the 

context of the G20 Growth Strategies. 83ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 20153.2 R
ISK ASSESSMENTPost-crisis surveillance in the euro area has stepped up risk discussions, with risks to the 
baseline scenario discussed for all member countries and risk assessment matrices included 

in most of the reports.
 By highlighting transmission channels and assigning probabilities to the 

crystallisation of risks as well as their potential impacts, the surveillance reports have provided for 

a sharper focus. Moreover, policy implications and responses are also covered in the bulk of cases. Useful risk assessments sufficiently stress the limitations/caveats of the analysis (in terms 
 of methodology and underlying data constraints) and take into account any unintended market consequences that their communication may entail, especially if these are likely to 
make headline news. With this in mind, while there could be merit in the Fund trying to identify 
all pertinent risks early on, due care would need to be taken to avoid communication pro-cyclically 

reinforcing trends in countries that may already be facing difficulties. There could also be room for 

a more structural role by improving communication on medium-term risk scenarios. 3.3 FINANCIAL STABILITYThe widespread coverage of financial stability issues in the reports for euro area countries 
shows that the IMF is making progress in addressing previous weaknesses in this area. Risks 
to the financial system and underlying vulnerabilities are considered in all Article IV reports on 

euro area countries, with most of them also covering macro-financial and cross-border linkages. 

The analysis and discussion of linkages vary across reports, however, and there is room for further 

elaboration and improvements regarding linkages. In terms of financial stability policies, measures 

were identified in each case and over half of the reports followed up on, or at least referred to, 

past FSAP recommendations. The first EU-wide FSAP was an important milestone. It focused on 
 how the EU/EMU supranational institutions interact with national institutions and put forward 

ﬁhigh-priority recommendationsﬂ on overcoming cross-border risks and improving the financial 

stability framework of the Single Market. The report also contained a section on lessons from 

national FSAPs, which offered an overview of the main risks and vulnerabilities identified in 

the national FSAPs of EU countries. Some of the recommendations, e.g. on banking union, have 

provided important input for actual policy shaping. However, policy recommendations could 

potentially be enhanced by more specific advice on issues relating to financial stability/sector 

matters, including, for example, cross-border cooperative arrangements or reductions of cross-

border barriers. By way of positive example, in the
 2013 EU FSAP, IMF staff consistently argued 

for a supranational approach to governance arrangements in order to counter national bias and 

prevent fragmentation in the EU. With the prospect of further work on a capital markets union in 

the EU, new opportunities open up for IMF policy recommendations in this field.The establishment of a banking union in Europe and the ensuing reshuffling of 
responsibilities in the areas of microprudential and macroprudential supervision 

are already starting to have implications for the way in which the IMF conducts its 
financial sector surveillance of EU Member States. This applies to both Article IV 
consultations and FSAPs for euro area countries. If IMF surveillance and advice are to remain 

effective and relevant, they will have to fully reflect the new policy-making frameworks 

and respective competences at EU Member State, euro area and European Union levels. 
 For Article IV surveillance of euro area countries, banking union means that the ECB must be 

consulted, given its new responsibilities in the areas of microprudential and macroprudential 

supervision. As far as FSAPs for euro area countries are concerned, close cooperation will be 
84ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015needed between the IMF and national and euro area authorities on the assessments of supervision, 
risks and resolution. The assignment of new policy responsibilities may also necessitate revisiting 

the decision governing the observer status of the ECB in the IMF. Moreover, in line with the Fund™s 

Integrated Surveillance Decision, due attention needs to be paid to closely linking assessments 

made in the course of bilateral/regional surveillance with those made in the context of multilateral 

surveillance. 3.4 TRACTIONThere is general agreement that, for IMF surveillance to be effective and relevant, the Fund 

has to ensure that it has adequate traction as a trusted advisor. The Fund™s 2012 staff guidance 
note for surveillance under Article IV consultations regards traction as having two dimensions: 
firstly, the extent to which authorities engage with the Fund on its analysis and recommendations, 

and secondly, the extent to which Fund advice is reflected in policy action. However, traction also 

has to be assessed in the light of the Fund™s role as one adviser among others; that is, authorities 

are not obliged to translate IMF advice into policy action. Thus, traction depends on high-quality 

analysis, even-handedness, candour and effective communication. The Fund has recently taken several steps to improve the traction of its advice within the euro 
area. This is a particularly onerous task owing not least to the challenges posed by the architecture 

of the monetary union. With regard to national and supranational authorities, it has focused more on 

issues of core interest to authorities and following up on its previous advice. For example, macro-

social issues have been discussed to some degree in nearly all of the reports for the euro area and 
its individual countries, with considerable emphasis placed on labour market developments and 

reforms, given their macro-critical role. In many cases, Fund staff have looked at the previous 

policy advice they have issued, but this exercise has normally focused on national authorities™ 

response to that advice and has not assessed the quality and relevance of the IMF™s own analysis 

and recommendations. An innovation worth noting is the ﬁPoint and Counterpoint to the Staff™s 

Viewsﬂ sections included in a few selected reports. In these sections, Fund staff put forward and 

respond to a series of possible counter-arguments to their own diagnosis and recommendations. 

This innovation could usefully be extended to all Article IV reports on euro area countries. Building 

on this, it might also be insightful to include a box on the quality of past IMF advice (including a 

review of whether and how the Fund has modified its own past advice) and the authorities™ response 

to it. By following up on recommendations in subsequent reports, and thus providing continuity and 

ensuring consistency of messages, traction can be further improved.Increasing the responsiveness of authorities to IMF advice may also be a matter of 
appropriate timing.
 For the euro area, there could be merit in better synchronising the issuance of 

Fund policy recommendations with the EU/euro area policy-making cycle, which would allow such 

recommendations to feed more effectively into EU/euro area decision-making processes. More use 

could then be made of IMF surveillance reports on individual EU Member States in the context of 

country surveillance processes conducted at the European level.4 IM
F SURVEILLANCE OF THE POLICY FRAMEWORK OF EMUOver recent years, IMF surveillance of the euro area policy framework has improved. 

The 2011 report on euro area policies set a good example by exploring the aspects of the framework 
that had led to the euro area sovereign debt crisis. More recent reports usefully made connections 
85ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015between different elements of the framework (e.g. the
 2012 report on euro area policies linked banking union with fiscal integration and fiscal consolidation under the SGP). The
 2013 report on euro area policies drew attention to potential risks (likelihood and expected impact) and 

recommended changes to some aspects of the framework in an innovative, clear and helpful 

ﬁrisk assessment matrixﬂ. The reports also usefully distinguished between the relative progress in 

different areas of the framework of the EU and the euro area.The stability and performance of the euro area and its members depend on good governance, and the IMF has made distinct efforts to examine this.
 EU/euro area governance, 
 i.e. the design and functioning of the EMU policy framework, is continuing its shift from national 

towards more joint or centralised policy-making. The IMF usefully dealt with governance in
 2011, 
for example, when IMF staff reports weighed in on discussions on strengthening the EU™s fiscal 

policy framework, including a critical analysis of the effectiveness of the SGP and its surveillance, 

decision-making, and enforcement mechanisms (such as the problem with qualified majority voting 

in the Council). This type of advice is helpful and could be further improved, for example, by 
delving deeper into some aspects, such as internal euro area surveillance, building on material 

IMF staff have developed on fiscal union and banking union, for instance; by following up on 

recommendations in subsequent reports to provide continuity and consistency in IMF messages; 

and by taking due account of the policy framework for reforms, including views on the appropriate 

balance of competences at the European and national levels.The current format of euro area consultations produces dual-track surveillance Œ of supranational policies and national policies Œ with separate interlocutors and no single 

comprehensive report on the euro area.
9 Multiparty engagement with policy authorities is 
an essential element of euro area surveillance. To this end, it has become standard procedure in 

reviewing euro area policies for the IMF to interact with the Eurogroup Working Group and the 

Eurogroup. This occurs at the end of the consultation process and is consequently a presentation of 

results rather than a consultation contributing to the substance of the surveillance exercise. As with 

national surveillance, there could be merit in involving policy-makers at the level of the Eurogroup 

Working Group at an earlier stage in the consultation process, with a focus on the functioning of the 

euro area as a whole, which could help enhance traction. 5 CONCLUSIONS 
The IMF has significantly improved its surveillance of the euro area and its member countries 

along the lines suggested in the 2011 landmark triennial review of surveillance. Overall, 

messages have become more consistent and focused across surveillance products. For euro area 

countries, there is now more integration between surveillance at the bilateral and euro area-wide 

level, while analyses at both levels draw on multilateral exercises such as the External Sector 

Reports and Spillover Reports. For all euro area countries, there is better integration between Article 

IV reports and national FSAPs. Moreover, risk assessment matrices showing risks, channels of 

transmission and policy options are now used in almost all euro area Article IV reports. Follow-up 

on past advice has improved thanks to dedicated boxes included since
 2012 in most national Article 

IV reports. Lastly, the Fund has also been very active in making suggestions on the institutional 
9 There are also mixed messages on who the IMF regards as ﬁeuro area authoritiesﬂ. The reports on euro area policies refer explicitly to 
ﬁthe authoritiesﬂ as being the ECB and the European Commission, but a much wider group is also mentioned, including the European 
Banking Authority, the European Systemic Risk Board, the European Stability Mechanism and the European Council, the Eurogroup and 
the Eurogroup Working Group. 86ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015architecture of the EMU, advocating more financial and fiscal integration in each of the recent euro 
area reports and advising on the creation of a European banking union. Nonetheless, there remains 

room for improvement in the surveillance of the euro area and its individual countries. There is still 

some way to go in fully implementing the 2011 TSR recommendations and making IMF surveillance 

more effective and better tailored to the specific circumstances of the relevant economies, not least in 

view of the recent significant changes to the surveillance framework within the EU/euro area itself. 
87ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015FORECASTING THE PRICE OF OILOil price forecasts are a crucial input into macroeconomic projections, in particular owing to the impact that oil prices have on inflation and output and, hence, on monetary policy. Using futures to 
forecast oil prices provides a transparent and simple tool which is easy to communicate. However, 

futures are an imperfect reflection of market expectations and have contributed to large forecast 

errors in HICP inflation in the past. This article presents an approach for checking the risks 

surrounding futures-based forecasts against a model combination which produces lower forecast 

errors and is more robust to changes in oil price dynamics.1 INTRODUCTIONFuture developments in oil prices tend to be an important conditioning factor in 
macroeconomic projections for output and inflation. 
With regard to inflation, the path of 

oil prices determines both the direct impact via the prices of energy products which are directly 

consumed by households, such as transport fuels, and the indirect impact via the production costs 

for final goods and services. Historically, much of the volatility in euro area HICP inflation has 

stemmed from changes in the energy component (see Chart 1). With regard to output, the impact of 

oil price developments essentially derives from the associated changes in real disposable income for 

households and companies and their knock-on effects for consumption and investment spending. Recent developments in oil prices have highlighted the difficulty in projecting such developments. While oil prices were broadly stable from 2011 to mid-2014, they declined by more 

than 50% from end-June 2014 to mid-January 2015 owing to an oversupplied oil market, with 

robust increases in North American shale oil production and sluggish oil demand growth. Since 
then, oil prices have increased by around 40%, mostly on account of some indications of a possible 

slowdown in US oil supply and expectations of higher oil demand. However, the near-term outlook 

remains highly uncertain. Chart 1 Euro area HICP inflation and Brent oil prices(annual percentage change)54

Issue 4 / 2015The performance of projections in terms of accuracy or bias critically hinges on the ability to 
anticipate the future path of oil prices.
 In the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections, 
 as in those of many other central banks and international organisations, the prices in oil futures markets 
 are used as technical assumptions to reflect expectations about future oil price developments.
1 However, large oil price forecast errors have been made using such futures-based assumptions. 

Reviews of the Eurosystem/ECB staff projections have shown that the projection bias for the HICP 

in the period since 1999 would have been significantly reduced if oil price movements had been 

better anticipated. Indeed, a large part of the underestimation of euro area HICP inflation in this 

period stemmed from this source. Against this background, this article discusses the general difficulties in forecasting oil prices 

(Section 2), elaborates on the forecast properties of oil futures (Section 3), provides an overview of 

alternative forecasting methods (Section 4), and introduces a newly developed forecast combination 

method for Brent oil prices (Section 5).2 THE DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING OIL PRICESAlthough oil prices are predictable to some extent, accurately forecasting them is a 

challenging task. Oil prices are predictable as oil is a physical commodity, the price of which is 

largely determined by oil fundamentals and in particular by global economic activity. Nevertheless, 

finding an accurate tool for oil price forecasting is complicated by the fact that oil market dynamics 

tend to vary substantially over time. This section discusses the determinants of oil price movements 

and explains the challenges that time variation in oil price behaviour poses for oil price forecasting. 
Depending on the driving factor, oil prices can behave very differently over time. Oil prices have evolved in very different ways over time, varying between being stable, trending upwards 

and falling abruptly (see Chart 2). Major movements in oil prices can largely be explained by 

changes in oil supply, oil demand and oil inventories. Taking a historical perspective, the major oil 

shocks of the 1970s and 1980s were caused by severe disruptions on the supply side.
2 Having been 
broadly stable for most of the 1990s, oil prices increased strongly from 2003 onwards owing to 

strong growth in global economic activity driven by emerging market economies, and in particular 

China. This demand-driven rise in oil prices was only interrupted in 2008 by the global financial 

crisis, which caused oil prices to drop by about 70% over a few months as a result of falling global 
economic activity that triggered a sharp slowdown in oil demand growth in advanced economies 

in particular. Following a rapid recovery from 2009 onwards, oil prices were broadly stable for 

about four years owing to slowing oil demand growth and the rise in shale oil production in North 
America, which were broadly offset by supply-side concerns related to geopolitical tensions in the 

Middle East and, to some extent, Russia. At the same time, continued gains in energy efficiency and 

increased substitution with other energy sources contributed to restraining oil demand growth. More 

recently, oil prices fell steeply as robust increases in North American shale oil production together 

with sluggish oil demand growth, particularly in China, caused the oil market to be oversupplied. 

Markets reassessed their outlook for the oil market in the light of receding geopolitical risks, as 

heightened geopolitical uncertainty in major oil-producing countries did not affect global oil supply. 
1 Brent crude oil prices are used as they are the leading global price benchmark for sweet light crude oil (given that Brent prices are used 
for the majority of internationally traded crude oil). In addition, Brent crude oil is mostly destined for European markets and therefore 
captures well the oil price dynamics relevant for the euro area, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) better reflects the US market. 2 See, for example, Hamilton, J.D., ﬁCauses and Consequences of the Oil Shock of 2007-08ﬂ, 
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 40 (1), 2009, pp. 215-283.89ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015Despite the oversupplied oil market, OPEC decided not to lower oil production at its meeting in 
November 2014. Historically, Saudi Arabia has tended to behave as the ﬁswing producerﬂ in the oil 
market, stabilising oil prices by reducing its output when oil prices decline and increasing it when 

prices go up.3 Its changed strategy in November exacerbated the oil price drop, as its decision not 
to react was interpreted as a move to maintain market share given the rise in North American shale 

oil. In sum, it is clear that the dynamics in the oil market can differ substantially depending on the 

driving factor of oil price movements. In addition to movements in oil supply and demand, the level 

of oil inventories and changes in that level also crucially determine oil price dynamics. In addition, oil price volatility seems to have increased over time 
(see Chart 2). There is empirical evidence that variations in the price elasticities of oil demand and supply create periods 

of elevated oil price volatility.
4 Other studies relate part of this higher oil price volatility to the 
increased use of oil as a financial asset. The active management of oil price assets in futures markets 

since the early 2000s, also referred to as the ﬁfinancialisationﬂ of the oil market, might have caused 

oil prices to react more quickly to macroeconomic news that is reflected in the prices of assets such 

as stocks and in exchange rates.5Changing oil market dynamics and increased oil price volatility have several implications 

for oil price forecasting. 
First, as oil is a physical commodity of which the price is largely 
determined by economic fundamentals, including data on these economic determinants helps in 

forecasting oil prices more accurately. Data limitations, with respect to fluctuations in global oil 

inventories, for
 example, nevertheless make it more difficult to accurately capture movements in oil 

fundamentals.6 In addition, as oil is also increasingly used as a financial asset, spot oil prices tend 
3 However, in a few instances such as in 1986, Saudi Arabia decided not to lower oil production as this strategy was deemed to be 
counterproductive in an environment of sluggish demand growth, weak cartel discipline and strong non-OPEC production growth.4 See, for example, Baumeister, C. and Peersman, G., ﬁThe role of time-varying price elasticities in accounting for volatility changes in the 
crude oil marketﬂ, Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol. 28(7), 2013, pp. 1087-1109.5 See, for example, Fratzscher, M., Schneider, D. and Van Robays, I., ﬁOil prices, exchange rates and asset pricesﬂ, 
Working Paper Series, 
No 1689, ECB, 2014.6 In 2011 the G20 recognised the importance of transparency in the oil market for world economic growth and expressed support for the 

improvement of data availability on oil production, consumption, refining and stock levels in the context of the Joint Oil Data Initiative.

rolling standard deviation of the nominal oil price.90ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015to reflect changes in the macroeconomic environment more rapidly. This might cause increased oil 
price volatility in the short run, making it more difficult to forecast oil prices over these horizons. 

Second, as oil market dynamics tend to change substantially over time (depending on the driving 

factor), there might be considerable instability in the performance of an individual forecast method 

that only captures a specific behaviour of oil prices. As a consequence, combining different 

forecasts that each capture a specific behaviour of oil prices might help in addressing time variation 
in the performance of individual forecast models caused by changing oil market dynamics. The next 

sections discuss the limitations of the futures-based oil price forecast and alternative approaches to 

oil price forecasting, while Section 5 describes a forecast combination approach for Brent oil prices 

in more detail.3 FUTURES AS A REFLECTION OF EXPECTED OIL PRICE MOVEMENTSOil price futures are frequently used as the baseline for oil price assumptions in economic 

projections. They are used, for example, in the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections 
and in the projections of many other central banks and international institutions.
 The main reason 
for using futures as a baseline for oil price assumptions is that they provide a simple and transparent 
method which is easy to communicate.However, oil price assumptions based on futures yield large forecast errors. 
Table 1 shows 
the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the Eurosystem/ECB 

projection assumptions for nominal oil prices four and eight quarters ahead for the period 2005 to 

2014. The MAE suggests that on average over this period, the projections four and eight quarters 
ahead deviated by about 17% and 20% respectively. The higher RMSE values show that the MAE 

masks important variations in the projection performance over time. These errors have a significant 

impact on inflation projections. While estimates of the impact of a 10% increase in oil prices on 

HICP inflation are surrounded by uncertainty, they tend to be in the range of 0.2-0.3 percentage 

point in the first year after the shock, and an additional 0.1-0.2 percentage point in the second 

year. This effect has been found to depend on the level of oil prices, with a stronger impact being 

measured when oil prices are at an elevated level.
7 In addition, futures had a negative forecast bias 
(see the third column of Table 1), indicating that oil prices tend to turn out higher on average than 

futures prices would suggest.The main reason for the large forecast errors of futures is that the futures curve is usually 
flat and downward sloping owing to the specific nature of oil as a physical and storable 

commodity. As a result, the wedge between futures and spot prices, which defines the slope of the 
futures curve, increases with the risk-free rate8, the risk premium and storage costs and decreases 
with the convenience yield. While the first two factors are present for any asset traded in the spot and 
7 See ﬁEnergy markets and the euro area macroeconomyﬂ, 
Occasional Paper Series, No 113, ECB, June 2010.8 The risk-free rate is the opportunity cost of buying a specific asset.

The convenience yield is the benefit of holding inventories and tends to be larger than the other 

components driving the wedge between futures and spot prices. As a result, spot prices are typically 

higher than futures prices, defining a downward slope which is also known as backwardation. The 

reason for this is that when oil markets are tight, demand for inventories at the spot price is high, 

bringing spot prices up relative to futures prices. However, the futures curve can also be upward 

sloping, a situation also known as contango. This situation occurred in the recent past owing to 

ample oil supply combined with a high level of inventories, and it also occurred before and after the 

global recession (see Chart 3). However, since 1999 the futures curve has been downward sloping 

for about 70% of the time.In addition to following a generally downward sloping path, futures curves are typically 
rather flat owing to the arbitrage between spot and futures prices. Futures therefore tend to 

predict oil prices quite well in times of stable prices, while forecast errors are high when oil prices 

are volatile. Chart 4 shows that for 2012 and 2013, futures for four and eight quarters ahead provided

Issue 4 / 2015fairly accurate projections as oil prices were relatively stable. However, forecast errors were large 
in periods of falling and rising oil prices, such as around the period of the global financial crisis and 

during the most recent episode of falling oil prices.Overall, oil price futures are an imperfect reflection of market expectations owing to the 
fact that arbitrage opportunities lead to a rather flat profile of the futures curve and the 

convenience yield typically results in a downward sloping futures curve
. Neither of these 
features are directly related to market expectations of future oil price developments. While changes 

in the slope of the futures curve can provide some information about market expectations regarding 

current and expected oil demand and supply fundamentals, overall the futures curve has not proved 

to be a good predictor of oil prices. 4 A
LTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO OIL PRICE FORECASTINGThe literature on oil price forecasting has grown rapidly over the past few years, partly 

as a response to the shortcomings of futures-based predictions. 
These alternative forecast 
approaches can be divided into three broad categories: (i) market-based and statistical approaches, 

(ii) approaches based on economic theory, and (iii) model forecast combinations. This section 
briefly discusses selected models in each of these categories. First, market-based indices or statistical methods have the advantage of being simple and 
transparent forecasting tools, but generally do not manage to consistently outperform other 

methods. With regard to market-based forecasts, an alternative to futures are ﬁrisk-adjustedﬂ 

futures, which attempt to correct the negative bias of the futures-based forecast by adjusting it for 

a risk premium. This risk premium, which affects the spread between the oil futures and the spot 

price, varies over time and is related to the business cycle. The risk-adjusted futures are found 

to outperform futures particularly at longer horizons beyond six months.
9 With regard to other statistical approaches, alternative methods of forecasting oil prices include the random walk (which 

assumes the future oil price to be equal to the price today), the random walk with drift (which 

assumes oil prices to grow at a specific rate), and simple autoregressive moving average models. 

However, none of these simple approaches tend to outperform other methods such as futures-based 
forecasting in a robust manner across forecast horizons and over time.Second, forecast models that include data on economic determinants tend to forecast more 
accurately than simple approaches. Such models are based on the observation that oil prices 
are largely determined by movements in economic variables such as oil demand and supply, 

global economic growth and interest rates. As such, to the extent that these economic variables 

contain information on future oil price developments, including them in forecasting models tends 

to improve the oil price prediction. There are many possible forecast approaches that are based on 

economic theory, ranging from simple regressions to more complex multi-variable models. For example, including data on non-oil commodities, oil supply and global economic 
activity helps in more accurately forecasting oil prices over specific forecast horizons and 

time periods. 
Based on the intuition that movements in non-oil commodities reflect movements 

in global commodity demand, forecasting oil prices using the recent growth rate of non-oil 

commodity prices appears successful in predicting oil prices in the short run. Simple regressions 
9 See Pagano, P. and Pisani, M., ﬁRisk-Adjusted Forecasts of Oil Pricesﬂ, The B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics, Vol. 9(1), 2009.93ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015linking the oil price prediction to changes in the risk-free interest rate and exchange rates of major commodity exporters have also been explored in the literature, among many other approaches.
10 Although they are more highly parameterised, vector autoregression (VAR) models that include 

data on oil production, inventories and global economic activity have proved to forecast oil prices 

more accurately than the random walk or futures over specific time periods, mainly in the short run. 

Using Bayesian techniques to estimate the VAR model can further improve the forecast accuracy 

of these VAR-based projections.11 Finally, structural models of the oil market can also be useful for 
oil price forecasting. For example, it has been shown that a general equilibrium model consisting 

of oil-exporting and importing regions that models long-term oil price dynamics can improve the 

forecast relative to futures in periods of rising oil prices, benefiting from, among other features, the 

inclusion in the model of a detailed structure of the supply side of the oil market and the assumption 

that oil prices follow a trend.12However, the general problem with individual forecast methods is that their forecast 

performance tends to be very unstable over time given the frequent changes in oil market 

dynamics. As already indicated in Section 2, this is because many models capture only a specific 
behaviour of oil prices over a particular horizon, and oil price dynamics tend to change considerably 

over time depending on the driving factor. For example, VAR models which include data on 

economic activity and oil fundamentals tend to result in accurate forecasts of short-run oil price 

movements that are driven by changes in global economic activity. However, they quickly lose 

their accuracy when other factors play a larger role and at longer forecast horizons. By pooling projections from different forecast approaches, forecast model combinations tend 
to offer a more accurate forecast that is also more stable over time. These types of forecast 
model are based on the recognition of the instability in the performance of individual methods. 

It is well established in the forecast combination literature that it is helpful to combine individual 

forecasts that have diverse forecast properties in order to find a projection which is more robust vis-

à-vis structural breaks in the variable to be forecasted.
13 Given the frequent changes in oil market 
dynamics, a model forecast combination has proved to perform well in oil price forecasting.14 5 A
 FORECAST COMBINATION FOR BRENT OIL PRICESThis section introduces a forecast combination which has been newly developed at the ECB for 

predicting Brent oil prices and investigates its performance in the context of the Eurosystem/

ECB staff macroeconomic projections.
 This model combination15 is constructed as an equally weighted average of the individual projections generated by (i) futures, which provide the current 

baseline in the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections; (ii) ﬁrisk-adjustedﬂ futures, 

which provide a statistical model that aims to correct the forecast error of futures by adjusting

Issue 4 / 2015for a time-varying risk premium linked to US economic activity; (iii) a Bayesian VAR (BVAR) 
model, which is an empirical model based on data related to oil fundamentals (oil production and 

oil inventories) and global economic activity; and (iv) a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 

(DSGE) model, which is a theoretical model of the long-term dynamics in the oil market (including 

data on global and Saudi Arabian oil production and global economic activity) in which oil prices 

are assumed to follow a trend. The advantages of using this specific combination are shown in a real-time and out-of-sample 
evaluation exercise that follows the set-up of the
 Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections (see Box 1 for details on the set-up of the evaluation exercise). The results demonstrate 
that also when following the set-up of the projections, the four-model forecast combination manages 

to improve the forecast accuracy over futures on average, reduce the negative forecast bias and, at 

the same time, offer a more robust forecast performance over time, justifying the use of the model 

combination as an alternative to the oil price forecast based on futures. In addition, as already 

mentioned in the previous section, individual models can perform quite differently depending on 

the behaviour of oil prices, which is why the performance of the individual models is examined not 

only for the 1995-2014 period as a whole, but also for sub-periods (see Table 2).Box 1THE SET-UP OF THE FORECAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION EXERCISEThis box provides an overview of how the forecast performance of the different models and of 

the model combination1 is evaluated.The evaluation focuses on real oil prices in US dollars and is conducted in real time and out 

of sample, at the cut-off dates for the projections using data from the first quarter of 1995 to 

the last quarter of 2014.2 For the estimation of BVAR model parameters, data back to January 
1973 are used. When monthly data are not available over the full estimation sample or are 

only available with delay, the series are backcast or nowcast in a way largely similar to the 

approach of Baumeister and Kilian.
3 For the risk-adjusted futures, monthly futures contract 
data from January 1990 onwards are used.4 All models are re-estimated at each point in time 
in the evaluation exercise, except for the DSGE model, the parameters of which are calibrated.
5 The forecast evaluation is applied to quarterly forecasts, up to 11 quarters ahead, which are 

obtained by aggregating the monthly forecasts. Real rather than nominal oil prices are used 

for two reasons. First, two of the models included in the combination, i.e. the BVAR and the 
1 The model combination and the different models that are included in the combination are those proposed in Manescu, C. and 
Van Robays, I., ﬁForecasting the Brent oil price: addressing time-variation in forecast performanceﬂ,

Journal of Business & Economic Statistics
, Vol. 30(2), April 2012, pp. 326-336.4 For futures contracts with longer maturities, the sample is even shorter, depending on data availability. Where possible, data series 
have been reconstructed backwards on the basis of growth rates of WTI futures with matching maturity.5 The DSGE parameters are calibrated using data available over the period from 1973 to 2009. The calibrated parameters refer to 
 long-term trends and relationships based on economic theory which can be assumed not to change frequently over time.95ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015The performance of the BVAR stands out during periods of stable and moderately increasing 
oil prices. Over the period from 1995 to 2001, when oil prices were initially broadly stable and 
then rose between 1999 and 2001, the BVAR is more accurate than futures for both short-term 

and longer-term forecast horizons, while the other models are more accurate than futures only in 

exceptional cases. The improvements vis-à-vis the futures-based model reach up to 24%, but they 

are not always statistically significant.Among the models included in the combination, the DSGE performs remarkably well during periods of increasing oil prices. 
For example,
 during the period 2002-07, the other three models used in the combination broadly outperform futures on the basis of the mean squared prediction 
error (MSPE) criterion, emphasising the disadvantage of futures forecasts owing to their generally 

downward sloping curve. Of the three, however, the DSGE performs best, with a 24% improvement 

for the horizon four quarters ahead, 51% for eight quarters ahead, and 67% for eleven quarters 

ahead (see Table 2, panel B). All these improvements are statistically significant. The success of the 
 DSGE, already produce forecasts of real oil prices.
6 Second, in practice, given the volatility 
of oil prices compared with the volatility of inflation, the difference between a focus on real 

prices and a focus on nominal prices should not be great.7 Two criteria are used as quantifiers 
in the evaluation, i.e.
 the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) and the forecast bias, and the 

evaluation is applied to different sub-samples such that the stability of the performance over 

time can also be evaluated. The MSPE is a commonly used measure of forecasting performance. 

In addition, it is important that policy-makers are aware of the magnitude of the bias inherent in 

the projections and the probability of making large forecast errors.6 Forecasting nominal oil prices would add more parameter uncertainty and probably worsen the performance of these two models. 
As the futures and risk-adjusted futures models retrieve forecasts of nominal oil prices, the approach for the evaluation exercise is to 
deflate these projections with the expected US CPI, which is forecasted using a three-month moving average process.7 When the forecast evaluation is conducted again using nominal oil prices, the four-model combination performs broadly the same.

Diebold Mariano, White and Hansen.96ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 4 / 2015DSGE model during this period is partly due to the assumption that oil prices follow a trend. Nevertheless, 
this compensates for the very poor performance of the DSGE model in the other sub-samples.During the more recent 2008-14 period, when oil prices were initially very volatile and then 

stabilised, the risk-adjusted futures model is very successful in forecasting at longer time 

horizons, while futures are successful at shorter horizons. 
From the second year onwards, the 

risk-adjusted futures model clearly outperforms futures. Moreover, the MSPE improvement is very 

high: 50% for the horizon eight quarters ahead and 75% for eleven quarters ahead.
16 Futures seem 
to perform well during this period for shorter time horizons,
 as demonstrated by the MSPE values 
(see Table 2, panel B). This assessment is also supported by the low forecast bias situated around 
zero for this particular period and these particular horizons.All models included in the combination manage to improve on the significant negative 
forecast bias of futures, which is mainly due to the backwardation characteristic of the oil 

futures curve. This seems to apply in particular to the DSGE model, which has an average forecast 
16 It should be noted that, for this period, the estimation sample Œ which for the risk-adjusted futures model only begins in January 1990 Œ is 
considerably larger, with up to 156 observations, which is twice the estimation sample size for the 1995-2001 period. For a model that is 
mainly based on ordinary least squares, this can result in greater consistency and robustness in the results.Chart 5 Bias of real oil price forecasts for selected time horizons(USD per barrel deflated by US CPI index)-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-102Q4Q8Q11Qfuturesadjusted futuresBVARDSGEfour-model combination-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-10a) 1995-2014b) 1995-2001-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-102Q4Q8Q11Qfuturesadjusted futuresBVARDSGEfour-model combination-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-10-4-20

four-model forecast combination) for the main sample and different sub-samples at selected forecast horizons (two, four, eight and eleven 

quarters ahead).97ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015bias of around zero over the whole evaluation period (see Chart 5). However, caution is needed in 
interpreting this finding, as this low value hides a high positive bias during the period from 1995 to 

2001 that is balanced out by a large negative bias in the subsequent periods. This notwithstanding, 

during periods of increasing oil prices, i.e. 2002 to 2007, the DSGE has the lowest bias. As also 

suggested by the MSPE, the BVAR has the lowest bias in times of stable and locally increasing oil 

prices, while the risk-adjusted futures model has the lowest bias in times of decreasing and stable 

oil prices, but only for longer time horizons, i.e. seven to eleven quarters ahead.It is thus clear that the different models perform well in specific periods and over specific 
horizons. As such, owing to these clear differences in forecast properties, combining the 

models offers substantial gains in forecast accuracy, both over time and across forecast 

horizons. Over the whole period from 1995 to 2014, the four-model forecast combination is more 

accurate than futures on average by 11%, 24% and 31% at forecast horizons four, eight and eleven 

quarters ahead respectively (see Table 2). At the same time, it reduces the negative forecast bias 

of futures on average by 46%, 43% and 42% at horizons four, eight and eleven quarters ahead 

respectively. The differences are all statistically significant, showing that the combination does a 

much better job than futures at longer time horizons, which are also more policy-relevant. In fact, 

the only horizons at which the combination does not outperform futures are the first and second 

quarters ahead. Notably, the four-model forecast combination outperforms not only futures as of 

the third quarter ahead but also all other models it includes.In addition, the performance of the four-model combination is very stable over time. For instance, in all sub-samples evaluated, the combination outperforms futures beyond the first and/

or second quarter ahead. Moreover, it also outperforms the other three models in most cases, with 

two notable exceptions: first, the DSGE model when oil prices follow an upward trend and, second, 
 in times of oil price volatility, the risk-adjusted futures model as of the horizon six quarters ahead. 

The gains offered by the latter are, however, not statistically significant (see Chart 6). Chart 6 Performance of the four-model combination and its underlying models across periods

Issue 4 / 2015All in all, combining individual projections offers several advantages for oil price forecasting 
relative to futures.
 The four-model combination generates a more accurate oil price forecast than 

futures, especially at longer policy-relevant time horizons, and helps to avoid large forecast errors 

on average. At the same time, the four-model combination has the disadvantage of being more 

complex than futures as a forecasting tool. Overall, the four-model combination is a useful tool for forecasting oil prices.
 As the 
combination entails models that contain data on oil fundamentals, it manages to hedge against risks 

related to strong movements in oil prices which are driven by oil fundamentals, similar to the way in 

which portfolio diversification hedges against individual investment risk. These strong movements 

are typically captured less well by futures given their relatively flat profile.6 CONCLUSIONAs oil prices have evolved very differently over time, accurately forecasting oil prices using 

one specific forecasting approach is challenging. Oil price futures, which are used for oil price 
forecasting by many policy institutions, including the ECB, have the advantage of being a simple 

and transparent forecasting tool. However, contrary to widespread opinion, futures are only an 
imperfect reflection of market expectations, and their typically flat and downward sloping profile 

causes large forecast errors in periods in which oil prices are volatile or steadily increasing. In turn, 

this can result in large forecast errors for inflation. Forecast models that include data on economic fundamentals tend to forecast oil prices more 
accurately than simple benchmarks, although their performance tends to be very unstable 

over time.
 As movements in oil prices can to a large extent be explained by changes in oil 

fundamentals and global economic activity, it has been shown that including information on these 

variables can improve the oil price forecast in periods when futures do not perform well. A problem 

with most forecast approaches, however, is that they only manage to capture a specific behaviour 

of oil prices over particular forecast horizons. As such, their accuracy might be very unstable over 

time and across forecast horizons. By pooling individual projections that have different forecast properties, a forecast combination can offer accuracy gains by comparison with an individual forecasting method 

and at the same time generate a projection which has a more stable performance over time. 

This article has shown that a four-model combination recently developed at the ECB improves the 

accuracy of oil price forecasts relative to those based on futures and other individual projections 

and seems to better hedge against making large forecast errors on average when oil price dynamics 

change. At the same time, using futures as a baseline has the advantage of providing a transparent 

and simple tool which is easy to communicate to the public. It is therefore useful to cross-check the futures-based forecast with the projections based 
on this four-model combination to assess the risks surrounding the futures-based oil price 

baseline in the context of the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections exercise. ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 4 / 2015S 1STATISTICSCONTENTS1 External environment S22 Financial developments S33 Economic activity S74 Prices and costs S11
