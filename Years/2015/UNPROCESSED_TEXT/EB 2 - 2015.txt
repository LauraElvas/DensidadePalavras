accommodation.

XTERNAL ENVIRONMENTGlobal growth is recovering gradually, albeit unevenly, across economies. On the one hand, the 
significant fall in oil prices is expected to boost global activity, supported by a robust outlook 

for growth in the United States. On the other hand, the deteriorating situation in some emerging 

market economies is weighing on the outlook for global growth. Global inflation has moderated in 

recent months. Annual rates of inflation are likely to remain low in the near term in view of the past 

decline in oil prices and to rise only gradually thereafter as the global recovery continues. Risks to 

global activity remain on the downside.The global economy is continuing along a path to gradual recovery. 

Lower oil prices are expected to boost global demand.

Issue 2 / 20152 FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
In December 2014 and most of January 2015 financial developments were driven largely by market 
expectations about the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) which was announced after 

the meeting of the ECB Governing Council on 22 January 2015. Before the APP announcement, 

euro area bond yields declined across instruments, maturities and issuers and reached new 

historic lows in many cases. Yields on AAA-rated long-term euro area government bonds declined 

while equivalent US bond yields increased, so that the spread between the two widened further. 

Yields on lower-rated euro area government bonds also declined but they displayed greater 

volatility, linked to the uncertainty surrounding Greece™s continued access to financial assistance. 

Following the announcement of the APP and in February and March, euro area government bond 

yields continued to decline. Furthermore, stock prices in the euro area increased significantly.

ONOMIC ACTIVITYThe euro area economic recovery has shown a gradual firming since mid-2014
 and labour markets have improved. Moreover, a number of factors have recently further supported euro area activity. 
Lower oil prices are bolstering real disposable income, thus supporting private consumption. The 
recent depreciation of the euro exchange rate has facilitated exports. The recently announced 

expanded asset purchase programme (APP) should further contribute to easing financing 

conditions and enhancing access to credit. Looking forward, economic activity is, therefore, 

expected to continue to strengthen during the course of
 2015 and beyond, driven by both domestic 

and external demand, although unemployment is expected to remain high. Against this background,

Issue 2 / 2015Global and domestic factors have accounted for the protracted fall in HICP inflation since 
late 2011, with the recent sharp fall in oil prices having been the main driver behind inflation turning 
negative in recent months. On the basis of prevailing oil futures prices annual HICP inflation is 

expected to remain at negative or very low levels over the coming months. The March
 2015 ECB 
staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area expect inflation to average at
 0.0% in 2015, but 
to rise significantly to
 1.5% in
 2016 and further to
 1.8% in
 2017. HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food is expected to rise from
 0.8% in 2015 to 1.3% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. The recent monetary policy measures are expected to contribute to the increase in inflation over the projection 

horizon and to underpin the anchoring of inflation expectations. The risks to the outlook for price 

developments over the medium term will be closely monitored, with a particular focus on the pass-

through of the monetary policy measures and geopolitical developments, as well as exchange rate 

and energy price developments. Inflation outcomes in recent months have been significantly lower than envisaged in the 
December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.

functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and easing bank lending conditions.In an environment of very low interest rates, money and loan dynamics improved further. 
Recent data indicate a pick-up in underlying growth in M3, but it still remains at subdued 
levels. Money-holders focus on overnight deposits.

Issue 2 / 2015The weakening of the broad-based NEER was mitigated by the euro™s strengthening by 
around 40% vis-à-vis the Russian rouble, which came under marked pressure in the 
context of the tensions in Ukraine.



against currencies of central and eastern European EU countries. 45ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 2 / 2015Box˜4FACTORS BEHIND RECENT HOUSEHOLD SAVING PATTERNS IN THE EURO AREAThe saving-to-income ratio is an important indicator of households™ behaviour that has 
an impact on the dynamics of real private consumption and, more generally, the pace of 

economic growth. 



The euro area household saving ratio has stabilised at relatively low levels in recent years, 
in comparison with the historical average.
Analysing households™ saving behaviour in the euro area from a historical perspective, 
a number of specific periods can be distinguished, each characterised by a different degree 

of influence of key driving factors.In the first phase of the recession and its aftermath, i.e. in the period from 2008 to 2010, 
the household saving ratio surged temporarily, driven primarily by faltering consumer 

confidence, before declining again. Chart A Euro area household saving ratio

Issue 2 / 2015Since 2011 the saving ratio has remained broadly stable at relatively low levels, reflecting 
compensatory effects of various factors that influence households™ decisions.

Looking ahead, the relatively sharp drop in oil prices observed since the summer 
of 2014 should support a temporary rebound of the saving ratio.


The expected hump-shaped response of the saving ratio may be linked to the uncertainty 
surrounding energy-related increases in real disposable income.
 Even if sustained, increases 

in real income owing to decreases in energy prices are generally surrounded by more uncertainty

THE 2015 MACROECONOMIC IMBALANCE PROCEDUREThe macroeconomic imbalance procedure (MIP), introduced in November 2011, is a 
cornerstone of the EU™s strengthened governance framework, which aims to prevent the 

emergence of harmful macroeconomic imbalances and to correct them when they are excessive. 

The MIP covers all EU Member States, with the exception of those subject to a macroeconomic 

adjustment programme. Following a first screening on the basis of a set of indicators, the Commission 

conducts in-depth reviews for a selected group of countries to assess the severity of the imbalances 

signalled by the indicators. If it concludes that imbalances are indeed present, the Member State 

concerned receives policy recommendations from the EU Council based on the recommendation of 

the Commission (preventive arm). By contrast, if imbalances are found to be excessive the excessive 

imbalance procedure should be initiated on a recommendation from the Commission.1 Under 
this corrective arm, the country concerned has to submit a corrective action plan outlining policy 

measures to address the excessive imbalances, which must be endorsed by the Council. In case of 

repeated failure to present an adequate plan or in case of non-compliance with an approved plan, the 

Council may impose financial sanctions on the euro area country in question.Outcome of the 2015 in-depth review
The outcome of the 2015 in-depth review shows that the European Commission has 
identified five countries with excessive imbalances: Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Italy and 

Portugal. The Commission decided to step up the procedure for Germany (from level 2 to 3), 

France (from level 4 to 5) and significantly for Bulgaria (from level 2 to 5), and to de-escalate 

the procedure for Slovenia (from level 5 to 4). Italy and Croatia have been in the same category 

since 2014. This year, Romania (level 2) and Portugal (level 5) have entered the procedure, 

following the end of their macroeconomic adjustment programmes. It is the first year that the 

Commission has formally introduced the classification of imbalances in six levels, although 

these were already implicitly used in the 2014 exercise (see Table A).1 Recital 22 of EU Regulation No 1176/2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances.Table A Macroeconomic imbalance procedure categories123456201420152014201520142015201420152014201520142015DKDKBEBEHUHUIEIEHRHRLULUBGNLDEESESITFRMTMTDESEFRSISIITATATNLROPTLTLTSEUKBGLVLVUKFIEEEEFIPOPOCZCZSKSKSource: European Commission.Legend: 1 = No imbalances; 2 = Imbalances which require monitoring and policy action; 3 = Imbalances which require monitoring and

59ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 2 / 2015ARTICLESPROGRESS WITH STRUCTURAL REFORMS ACROSS 
THE EURO AREA AND THEIR POSSIBLE IMPACTS 
Structural reforms have the potential to substantially boost productivity and employment and to 
reinvigorate growth in the euro area, while also improving the ability of countries to rapidly adjust 

to shocks, reallocate resources and restructure their economies. This article illustrates the effects 

of structural reforms on key macroeconomic variables, describes the recent progress of product 

and labour market reforms, and suggests that further structural reforms could be a powerful tool 

to restore growth and competitiveness in the euro area. There are signs that reforms undertaken 

since the start of the crisis have already had a positive impact; wages and prices appear to be 

more flexible and have helped the adjustment process, while export performance also seems to have 

improved in countries which have adopted reforms. Even though some euro area countries have 

made significant progress, indicators show that there is still ample room for further reforms across 

the euro area. This is necessary to support long-term sustainable growth, to increase the adjustment 

capacities of the euro area countries and to support the smooth functioning of the Monetary Union. 
1 MACROECONOMIC IMPACTS OF STRUCTURAL REFORMSStructural reforms can lead to higher sustainable employment, investment and growth as 

well as provide the flexibility needed for a smooth-functioning Monetary Union.

Box 1 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SHS DATA AND OTHER SECURITIES STATISTICSA number of features of SHS data have to be taken into account when reconciling the main 
aggregates derived from these data with other available (aggregate) statistics on securities 

holdings.More importantly, one of the main aspects that influence the coverage and quality of SHS 

data is the collection method,

jurisdiction or if the costs to collect the data directly from the investors are too high

 83% of the total outstanding amount of securities 
issued by euro area residents

Another conceptual difference is caused by the treatment of derogations.

Other differences may exist, including valuation and measurement differences, depending 
on the selected benchmark data.Table 2 SHS Sector holdings of securities issued by euro area residents at the end

 prove useful when, inter alia,

mismatches in the maturity of assets and liabilities


3.2˜CASE STUDY˜2: INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE MAIN EURO AREA SECTORS 
One of the benefits of SHS data is that they provide information on securities holdings by 
main euro area sector, with the same sector on the issuer side.


Direct exposures owing to securities issued by one euro area sector being held by another 
sector differ significantly, according to the type of security.

USE OF SHS FOR THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE INTEGRATED EURO AREA FINANCIAL 
 AND NON-FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BY INSTITUTIONAL SECTOR 
The integrated euro area financial and non-financial accounts (EAA), published quarterly 

by the ECB since June
 20071, provide a comprehensive overview of the economic and 
financial transactions by all institutional sectors in the euro area.

In the financial accounts, ﬁwho-to-whomﬂ data refer to financial transactions and/or 
positions for which both the creditor and debtor sectors can be simultaneously identified 

and presented in a fully consistent manner, i.e. without double-counting or gaps.

This article has introduced the new quarterly security-by-security data on securities holdings.
 
The granularity and comprehensiveness of the data mean they can be used for a wide range 
of purposes, Selected aggregates derived from the SHS data will also be made available for public use 
15Although the new SHS data are already a significant improvement on the information available 
on securities holdings, further enhancements are envisaged.
consideration. 15


The compilation of the financial accounts on a who-to-whom basis requires primary 

sources containing information on the institutional sector of the counterpartylimited tradability makes it easier to obtain counterparty information from primary data sources. An extension of the who-to-whom coverage to all marketable instruments, namely debt 
securities, quoted shares and investment fund shares, will now be possible thanks to the 

detailed information contained in the SHS.2


first publication of the EAA with extended who-to-whom coverage will 
take place in early 2016.
