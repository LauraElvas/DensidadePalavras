EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Much of the Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) 
is growing at a healthy 
pace, while Russia and other CIS economies are facing significant economic challenges
. 
The region as a whole is expected to return to positive growth next year
.  Overall, activity in 
the region is set to contract by 0.6 percent in 2015 and expand by 1.3 percent in 2016. This is 
little changed from the spring 2015 projections, but the risks have shifted to the downside: 
 Central and Eastern Europe
 (CEE)
, Turkey, and most of the
 Southeastern European
 (SEE)
 countries
 are expected to maintain solid, largely domestic-demand-driven growth in 2015
16. 
There are also some external tailwinds, such as lower oil prices and improved euro-area growth 
prospects. Furthermore, several CESEE European Union (EU) member states benefited from a 

temporary boost to investment from a sharp increase in utilization 
of EU Structural and Cohesion 
Funds (SCFs). In contrast, growth has softened in the 
Baltics
 due to weaker demand from the CIS.
  The economies of
 Russia, Ukraine,
 and 
other CIS
 countries will contract this year, with 
some stabilization expected in 2016. Russia continues to adjust to low oil prices and Western 

sanctions, but is expected to remain in recession in 2016. Ukraine is projected to return to 
positive growth next year, despite multiple challenges related to ambitious reforms, significant 
macroeconomic adjustment, and economic dislocations in the eastern part of the country.
  And the balance of risks has shifted to the downside.
 New risks to trade and capital flows 
stemming from a possible further slowdown in major emerging markets (notably, in China) as 

well as the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe are the main additions to long-standing risks.
 The key policy challenges are broadly similar
 from those discussed in the Spring 2015 
Regional Economic Issues
 report
. Supporting domestic demand, addressing crisis legacies, 
rebuilding buffers against external shocks, and improving the business environment to boost 

investment and long-term growth remain important. Country-specific priorities depend on how 

far along these economies are in the postcrisis adjustment and their exposure to external risks. 
 Where the recovery is well advanced
, the policy priorities need to increasingly shift 
toward the medium term, including rebuilding fiscal buffers and continuing with reforms to 
improve the business environment and address structural weaknesses. This is not to deny that 

there is still a lot of uncertainty about the strength of global recovery that, domestically, inflation 

is still too low in many CESEE economies, and that the key crisis legacies
high nonperforming 
loans (NPLs) and debt overhangs
still need to be addressed in some countries (notably, in SEE).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
  2  For economies that are in recession
, the key challenge is to steer the adjustment to 
terms-
of-trade and other shocks with a view to supporting weak internal demand and reducing 
high inflation.
  Countries vulnerable to external shocks
such as those with large external financing 
needs, weak fiscal positions, or high dependence on commodity exports
need to be prepared 
to deal with market pressures by using exchange rate flexibility as a shock absorber alongside 
macro-prudential policies to contain the buildup of financial sector risks and gradually rebuild 

foreign exchange reserves if they are below prudent levels.
 Large fiscal challenges remain in CESEE
, despite progress with consolidating the fiscal stance 
and improving the quality of budgets in recent years.
 Can CESEE countries reconcile fiscal 
consolidation with growth? The analysis presented in this 
Regional Economic Issues
 report offers 
some insights: 
 Most CESEE economies entered the 2008
09 global financial crisis with growth-
unfriendly budgetary structures relative to their peers
. On the 
spending side
, budgets were 
characterized by high public consumption and large unproductive transfers. On the 
revenue side
, they were characterized by a disproportionate reliance on labor taxes, notably social security 
contributions. Structures reflected a mixture of legacy issues from the economic transition of the 

1990s, an aging population burdening social security systems, and 
an orientation based on 
Advanced Europe, which sustains similar budgetary structures but with support from much 

higher per capita incomes. 
 Budgets have generally improved since the global financial crisis,
 when severe 
pressure on many CESEE budgets forced fiscal adjustment. On the 
revenue side
, many countries 
managed to shift the tax burden from taxes harmful to growth
such as the corporate income 
tax (CIT)
to more neutral forms as taxation
such as the Value-Added Tax (VAT). 
On the 
spending side,
 countries with access to EU SCFs often managed to avoid large cuts in public 
investment. Large fiscal savings came instead from reforming entitlement programs and 
reducing public consumption.  
 Fiscal consolidation in CESEE has not yet run its course, with sizable adjustment 
needs remaining, especially in SEE
. To safeguard or improve the quality of budgets during 
consolidation, the focus should be on reducing unproductive transfers and further reforming 
entitlement programs, including public pension systems. Restructuring public employment may 

also be called for, especially where the public sector wage bill is high, either because of excessive 
employment levels or disproportionately high public sector wages. On the revenue side, 
policymakers should focus on achieving a sizable part of the adjustment through indirect taxes, 

and consider the introduction or strengthening of carbon and property taxes.  
 For countries that do not have urgent fiscal consolidation needs, fiscal reform is 
still called for
 to enhance the quality of their budgets
, including by shifting taxation toward 
indirect taxes, and increasing the efficiency of health and infrastructure expenditures.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
, 
OUTLOOK
, AND RISKS
 
While a modest contraction in activity is expected this year for the Central, Eastern and South
-
eastern Europe (CESEE) as a whole, 
this reflects widely divergent country
-
specific developments
. 
Most 
economies are growing at a relatively healthy pace, 
with t
he exception of 
Russia and the rest 
of the CIS
, which
 
are in recession. 
CESEE growth is expected to turn positive in 2016, but risks are 
tilted to the downside. 
Regional
 
financial markets have, generally, weathered well the recent bouts 
of market volatilit
y stemming from worries about Grexit, slowing activity in China, and falling 
commodity prices
.

Recent 
Developments
 
In the first half of 
2015
, 
economic development
s 
continued to differ widely 
across 
CESEE 
countries 
(Figure 1

)
:
 
 

 
In

Southeastern Europe
an EU member
s
 
(SEE EU) 
the 
recovery
, generally,
 
proceeded
 
at a 
solid
 
pace
. The main tailwinds were 
stronger
 
domestic 
demand, 
lower oil prices, 
improved euro area growth prospects 
following 
the launch of the 
EC

quantitative easing (
QE
)
,
 
and 
increased
 
absorption of 
the 
EU 
Structural and Cohesion 
Funds 
(SCFs)
. 
Both CEE and SEE EU
 
also 
benefited from improved 
competitiveness vis
-
Ã 
-
vis 
the rest of the world, as
 
their 
currencies weakened along 
with the euro. 
 

 
Most 
SEE non
-
EU 
economies
, except Serbia,
 
also saw relatively strong growth
. 
In contrast
, 
Serbia 
is
 
only gradually 
emerging 
from the recession 
caused by the devastating floods in 2014
.
 

 
Growth in the 
Baltics
 
has softened
 
this year 
due to 
larger
-
than
-
expected spillovers from the 
recession in Russia and other CIS
 
countries
.
 

 
In Turkey
, 
growth remained robust
,
 
in the face of downside risks to invest
or confidence 
stemming from 
political uncertai
nty and elevated corporate debt
.
 

 
Russia and the 
rest of the
 
CIS
 
are in recession
.
 
The Russian 
economy
 
contracted 
due to
 
a 
combination of 
continued Western sanctions, 
low
 
oil prices
,
 
and 
structural weaknesses
. The 
recession
 
deepened in Ukraine, reflecting declining activity in the eastern conflict zone
 
and 
ongoing macroeconomic adjustment
. Russia

 
has had a negative effect on activity 
in other CIS countries 
through the trade and remittances c
hannel
s
 
and 
via 
confidence effects 
on consump
tion and investment
.
 
Domestic demand
 
was generally robust outside the CIS, with investment growth supported 
by greater absorption of EU SCFs. 
Private 
consumption 
remained buoyant across CESEE EU 
countries and Turkey (Figure 1.2), on the back of lower oil prices and favorable employment and 
in
come dynamics
. 
Investment 
surged in 
SEE EU
 
countries and remained a major growth factor in 
CEE EU
, driven by the s
harp acceleration 
in 
the absorption of 
SCFs
 
before 
the pending
 
deadline 
for use of budgeted amounts for 2007

13
 
(
Box 1.1). 
In 
contrast, consum
ption 
and investment 
in 
the 
CIS declined 
in response to worsening terms of trade, tighter credit conditions 
(Figure 1.3)
, 
and strong inflationary pressures (Figure 1.

financing to ensure ownership

operational program. Certain costs, for instance most land purchases and

financing to 40

operating costs, 
such as
 
those for 
waste management projects, are fully born

There are three SCFs
: (
1
) 
the
 
European Fund for Regional Development
, which is tasked with modernizing 
economic structures (e.g., improve public administration), infrastructure (e.g., improve metro systems), 
and 
support 
R&D
 
and innovation
, 
environmental protection (
e.g.,
 
solar 
and wind energy, waste water and 
sewage projec
ts), etc.; (
2
) the 
European Social Fund
, which focuses 
on increasing worker and enterprise 
adaptability
 
and
 
employment 
participation, and reinforcing social 
inclusion, 
among other areas
; and 
           
(

) 
the 
Cohesion Fund
, which 
supports regions with 
per capita 
g
ross 
n
ational 
i
ncome 
of less than 90 
percent of
 
the EU average
, 
in the 
transport, environment and energy 
sectors
.
 
The allocations from the first 
two funds are guided by the 
principle 
of additionality
, under which only new 
projects can be 
financed.
 
The funds are primarily spent on public and private investment, but also on goods and services
. CESEE 
countries use a bigger share of the SCF allocations, relative to the 
average for the EU, for
 
transportation 
infrastruct
ure and environmental pro
j
ects
 
(
see F
igure
 
above
). Both CEE and SEE EU countries invest less in R&D 
than their EU peers.
 
 
SCF allocations are budgeted over 7
-

 
(e.g., 2007

13; 2014

20). Funds that are not 
drawn within the pertinent deadlines (i.e., two 
years 
(
N+2) or three years (N+3) are, generally, lost for recipients. 
SCFs are administered by national authorities under close monitoring by the EC. Following the negotiation of 

tates for each program 

National authorities choose the individual projects, with the EC monitoring all aspects of the process, including 
proc
urement procedures, IT systems, audit practices, etc. There is typically under
-
execution of SCF absorption in 
the beginning of each program period (figure below). Besides some advance payments at the start of each 
program period, reimbursements are made up
on the presentation of invoices vetted and ultimately certified 
initially by the national certifying authority
 
and then by the EC
. If proper procedures are not followed, 

regulations, or outright fraud, 
may be identified. In cases of serious irregularities, the reimbursement of EU Funds can be suspended. Confirmed 
irregularities also trigger an adjustment in EU co
-
financing, ranging from a haircut to a full charge back to 
g
overnments. The EU grants, however, may not always be fully lost, since they can be reallocated to other

have sharply increased the absorption

13 funds in the run
-
up to the pending deadline for their use
. In 
the 
case of Romania and 
Hungary, 
EC payouts were not as strong 
in the first half of the yea
r
. In Hungary, this was 
due 
to the suspension of some operational programs
, with the burden of payment temporarily shifted to the national 
budget. 
In 
Romania, there is a discrepancy in the timing of recording of disbursements between the EC data and 
fiscal
 
accounts
, as the former are on a cash basis and the latter are on a commitment basis. Fiscal data
 
point to an 
increase in absorption in 
the first half of 
2015. For all countries, the absorption in the second half of the year is 
expected to be even stronger, as countries strive to reach 
certified 
payout rates 
of 
95 percent. 
On the other hand, 
Lithuania and Estonia have already absorbed most of the available 
funds from the 2007

13 
program 
period. 
 
The hastened absorption could, however, adversely 
affect growth 
and fiscal positions
:
 

 
Rushed projects may be more prone to irregularities, which may 
result in larger fiscal burden in 2015

16. 
 

 
If they were to materialize, recently floated ideas about 
retroactively 
providing 
EU funding for projects that or
iginally 
had 
been fully domestically financed would create risks for 
use of th
e 
newly created fiscal space
 
for unproductive current spending.
 

 
Since efforts have been focused on the previous 
seven
-
year 
program period, preparations for the new period (2014

20) have 
been delayed in some countries. This may cause a slump in 
absorption of SCFs in 2016, adversely affecting growth. 
 

 
Priority may have been given to shovel
-
ready projects (e.g., 
amelioratio
n of urban public spaces) rather than to ones that 
could better enhance potential output.

These potential downsides are likely to be less of an issue in the Baltics, which have demonstra

The recent fall in inflation expectations in SEE and CEE EU countries
 

for which 
comparable data are available

cannot be fully explained by their norma
l response to falling oil 
prices (see
 
Box 1 in IMF (2015b) for details). Thus far, this overshooting does not appear to have 
impacted real activity, but renewed disinflationary pressure would raise concerns of possible 
unanchoring of inflation expectations.

What explains the resilience of 
the 
CESEE 
financial markets?
 
One reason is that t
rade links of 
the
 
CESEE
 
region with China are relatively small
 
(Box 1.2). In addition, 
the impact of China

 
rebalancing on commodity prices is a positive terms
-
of
-
trade shock for most CESEE countries, in 
contrast with emerging market
 
commodity exporters (such as Brazil, Indonesia, 
and 
Russia). 
At 
the same time, m
ost CEE and SEE countries are in a different 
phase of the c
redit cycles compared 
with other emerging markets
. 
M
any 
CEE and
 
SEE countries have
 
made 
notable 
progress i
n 
private sector deleveraging 

via improvements in the priv
ate saving
-
investment balance
s
 

that 
has reduced their external vulnerabiliti
es 
(Figure 1.11)
. 
This makes them more resilient to 
changes in international investor sentiment. 
That said, these countries 
are not 
immune to 
a
 
more 
persistent rise in global risk aversion
, which could 
result in sustained
 
capital
 
outflows
, with a
 
greater i
mpact on countries with a large
r
 
share of foreign investors in thei
r local markets (such as 
Poland
 
and Hungary).

The direct trade links between CESEE and China 
are small
. 
T
he share of domestic value added from 
the region consumed by China is less than 2 percent 

those CESEE economies that are more integrated
 
into 
the global supply chains (the Czech and Slovak 
Republics, and Hungary) are most exposed. This 
suggests that

in the absence of any impact of 

premiums 

the impact on CESEE would be small.
 
 
Model 

growth slowdown to CESEE via the real channel

through both direct and indirect channels

confirm that the impact is fairly small. 

Flexible System of Global Models (FSGM) used for 
this exercise is a multi
-
region, forward
-
looking, semi
-
structural model (Andrle, M., et. al., 2015). In the 
model, lower growth in China affects world growth 
through two channels. First, lower than expected 
investment and growth in China implies weaker 
exports for the rest of the 
world. Second, it implies weaker global demand for commodities and lower 
commodity prices (including oil and metals). The simulation assumes a weakening of Chinese growth by 
around 1.5 percentage points on average over the next five years (relative to the 
October 2015 WEO 
baseline), combined with yuan depreciation vis
-
Ã 
-
vis the dollar by 10 percent and an increase in the 
Chinese risk premium by 100 basis points. All countries with policy space are assumed to use it to offset the 
shock. Model simulations sho
w that the impact on CESEE countries would be relatively small (see Figure 
below). This is, importantly, due to the assumption that these countries have fiscal and in most cases 
monetary space to engage in countercyclical policies that counteract the impac
t of the shock.
 
 
Spillovers from a broader economic slowdown in emerging economies would be bigger, but 
manageable.
 
The October 2015 WEO (Scenario Box 1) presents a scenario that assumes a slower pace of 
catching
-
up and lower productivity growth, combined with a tightening of external financing conditions in 
large emerging economies (including in Russia and Turkey). Co
mmodity prices fall and emerging market 
currencies depreciate in response to the growth slowdown and reversal of capital flows. 
The key results are 
as follows:
 
 

 
The impact on smaller emerging economies in CESEE is double that under China
-
only slowdown, but
 
is 
short
-
lived and small relative to the size of the assumed negative shock on large emerging markets. 
 
 

 
The substantially lower growth in Russia and Turkey compared to baseline under this scenario mostly 
reflects the assumed slowdown of their own potenti
al growth, rather than spillover effect from China 
and other emerging economies. The spillover
s
 

 
 
to Russia and Turkey
 
from 
a
 
structural slowdown in
 
the 
other emerging markets
 
is of similar 
magnitude to that in non
-
euro area EU countries.

In 2016, 
growth 
in many
 
CESEE 
countries is expected to continue at a pace 
broadly similar 
to that 
in 
2015, except in CIS and the Baltics 
(Figure 
1.

2
 
and Annex I
)
. 
As the 
Russian 
economy stabilizes and 
contraction of activity slows
 
and 
Ukraine

 
rebounds
, 
neighboring economies will be seeing higher growth rates in 2016. By contrast, t
he anticipated 
normalization of the annual absorption rate of EU SCFs will likely s
low growth in CEE (
Box 1.1).
 
The expected sustained growth in SEE EU countries 
is 
predicated on a successful rotation of 
investment expenditures from 
the absorption of 
EU funds 
in
to private investment. 
In the SEE 
non
-
EU countries, the IMF program with Serbia is forecast to help support a somewhat stronger 
rebound from the 2014 recession. 
 
 
Inflation trends will 
continue to be bimodal 
in 2016 
(Figure 
1.
1
3
 
and Annex II).
 
T
he weakness 
of emerging market cur
rencies amidst the ongoing rotation of financial sector risks from 
developed to emerging markets will keep inflation elevated
 
in the CIS and Turkey
, albeit on a 
downward trajectory. The significant downward revision in 
World Economic Outlook (
WEO
)
 
medium
-
t
erm projections of commodity prices are driving 
mark
downs to 
inflation forecasts in 
the rest of CESEE, though inflation is 
generally 
expected to move closer to central bank inflation 
targets.
 
The inertia in inflation expectations is contributing to the slo
w pace of change in inflation 
outcomes.  
 
C
.   
Risks
 
 
The balance of risks to CESEE growth has shifted from broadly neutral at the time of the

New risks to trade and capital flows 
stemming from a possible further
 
slowdow

A s
urge in financial 
market 
volatility
 
and
 
a
 
tight
ening in global financial conditions
:
 
Given 
their
 
high 
dependence on foreign funding
 
and generally compressed risk premiums
 
(
Box 
1.
3
)
, 
CESEE
 
countries are vulnerable to 
tightening 
of
 
external financing 
conditions
 
that coul
d be 
triggered by 
dislocations in 
advanced or emerging markets:
 
o
 
Contagion from renewed selling pressures
 
and 
volatility in emerging markets
 
(
including 
China
)
, 
on account of weaker 
emerging market 
fundamentals
 
could 
result in 
capital 
outflows and liquidity strains on 
CESEE 
sovereigns and le
veraged 
firms. 
 
o
 
A return of financial stress in 
the euro area 
(e.g., on concerns about the Greek program) 
remains a risk,
 
particularly for weaker subsidiaries of Greek banks in 
SEE
, 
as well as other 
CESEE sovereigns and financial institutions that are 
reliant on funding from the euro area
.
 
o
 
A faster
-
than
-
expected 
tightening in 
the 
U.S. 
monetary polic
y 
or
 
a persistent U.S. dollar 
appreciation 
could trigger a 
reassessment of 
emerging market
 
prospects. A s
trong
er
 
U.S. 
dollar 
and higher dollar borrowing cost
s 
may lead to 
balance sheet strains in countries 
with significant

, such as Russia, Turkey, 
Hungary 
and Ukraine.
 
 

 
Intensification of geopolitical tensions 
(
around 
Russia/Ukraine and 
the 
Middle
-
East) 
could 
prolong recessions in CIS co
untries and dampen investor sentiment in other countries (
e.g.
, 
the Baltics, Turkey). 
The
 
ongoin
g refugee crisis in Europe 
(
Box 1.4)
 
could 
put pressure on 
public finances, 
disrupt trade flows

as countries struggle to secure their borders

and

As 
discussed in the Spring 2014 REI, the 
level of 
rollover ris
k
 
depends critically on the composition of external 
borrowing. For some countries (most notably the Baltic 
states) the rollover risks are mitigated by the fact that a 
sizable portion of payments falling due is rela

inter

, which h

have 
a relatively 
large share of maturing debt denominated in USD
 
(Turkey,

) are 
more vulnerable to 
the USD 
appreciation and to the U.

Making Sense of Different Attitudes toward 
Migration
 
among EU Countries
1/
 
The recent surge in migrant
2/
 
flows to Europe has put in the spotlight the long
-
standing issue of migration. 
Governments have taken different approaches to the current humanitarian c
risis, with some balking at the costs 
imposed on EU frontier countries by the Dublin regulation

under which requests of asylum seekers from outside 
the EU 
should be
 
processed 
in
 
the country where they first enter

while others suspending the 

pr
ovisions in or
der to legally accept 
migrants. What accounts for these differences in attitudes?
 
 
International experience offers evidence on 
both the 
short
-
term 
costs and 
potential long
-
run 
benefits of migration.
 
An upcoming IMF 
Staff Discussion Note argues that t
he net fiscal 
impact 
of migration 
is
, initially, 
likely to be 
negative, reflecting the co
st of humanitarian aid 
and integration policies. Over time, however, the 
fiscal burden diminishes, as migrants gradually 
enter the labor force and contribute to tax 
revenues.
 
T
he impact on employment and wages 
of native workers is 
generally found to be sma
ll 
and short
-
lived. I
n the long
-
run
, the 
expansion of 
the labor force should boost the potential output 
of host countries.
 
Fully leveraging on the human 
capital potential of migrants depends crucially on 

 
 
D
ifferen
t 
countri

-
term costs or 
long
-
term benefits can be seen as reflecting 
differences in institutional capacities, income 
levels, and 
other 
factors. 
Migration flows are 
driven, to a large degree, by differences in income 
levels and strength of social safety nets between 
sender and receiver countries. 
Most CESEE 
countries with per capita incomes below USD 
15,000 (PPP
-
adjusted) have been on the 
sender 
side of migration flows since the late 1980s
 
(see 
Figure
 
above
). Inward migration to wealthier 
CESEE countries has been mos
tly from other 
CESEE countries. Overall, the 
share of foreign
-
born persons living in Central, Eastern, and 
Southeastern Europe
 
(CESEE) is much lower than 
in Western Europe (see Figure below).
 
CESEE 
countries, 
therefore, 
general
ly 
lack the 
institutional setup and knowhow to integrate 
large numbers of migrants from outside Europe.

FISCAL CONSOLIDATION
 
IN CESEE AND ITS 
LONG
-
TERM 
IMPACT ON 
GROWTH
 
 
After the onset of the global financial crisis, 
economies in 
CESEE came under pressure to 
correct external and internal imbalance
s
. By now, much of the external 
adjustment 
has taken 
place, via increases in private and public savings and, mainly, 
through 
declines in investment 
relative to GDP

a process that 
has come with high unemployment
 
in ma
n
y cases.
2
 
 
T
he global financial crisis of 2008
-
09 forced sharp, pro
-
cyclical fiscal adjustments
 
on many 
CESEE countries
, typically triggered by a sharp tigh
tening in financing conditions and the re
-
assessment of longer
-
term growth prospects. Fiscal adjustment is not yet complete, 
with 
significant consolidation needs remain
ing
 
in several economies, many of them in South
e
astern 
Europe (see below).
 
 
The quality 
of 
fiscal
 
adjustment is the focus of this chapter, taking a longer
-
term 
perspective.
 
As most countries 
in CESEE 
have emerged from the crisis and its aftereffects,
 
this is 
an opportune time to take stock of the 
structural 
quality of 
their 
budgetary systems,
 
how these 
have changed during adjustment, 
and 
of 
reform needs that remain. 
While there are several 

-
cutting 
studies on expenditure and revenue reforms, notably in 
the IMF Fiscal Monitor (2013, 2014), this 
study takes a regional perspective, looking for common traits and lessons that can be drawn 

 
 
The chapter focu
ses
 
on the 
structural
 
quality of budgets. 
At its core are questions such as: do 
revenue systems limit disincentives to work, save, and invest? Does government spending 
promote productive activities

particular
ly
 
the accumulation of physical and human capital

or 
does it finance mostly unproductive transfers? The focus is not on 
cyclical
 
budgetary 
management, which is covered extensively in IMF bilateral surveillance, notably Article IV reports.  
 
A

How Growth Friendly Are Budgets in CESEE? 
 
Budge
t structures in CESEE resemble more those of Advanced Europe than of other Emerging 
Economies, 
despite 
significantly lower GDP level
s
. On the spending side, transfers and public 
consumption tend to be higher than among peers, on the revenue side, CESEE government
s
 
rely 
disproportionately on social security contributions and consumption taxes. Overall, 
most 
CESEE 
countries
 
entered the global financial crisis with relatively growth unfriendly budget
 
structures.

CESEE Budget Structures Compared to Peers
 
Budgetary syst
ems in CESEE are young.
 
Many of their features were put in place during the 
economic transition from socialism 
in
 
the early 1990s. This (relative) youth has been both a 
blessing and a curse
. O
n the one hand, CESEE countries could design many budgetary elem
ents
 
from scratch

notably on the revenue side

and in 
so 
doing could draw on international 
experience. On the other hand, legacy issues burdened the transition, such as loss
-
making state 
owned enterprises, overburdened social security systems, and excessive
 
public employment. In 
some cases, these issues inhibit fiscal policy to this day.
 
3
 
 
Public expenditure levels in Central and Eastern Europe (CESEE) are high and resemble 
more those of Advanced Europe than of other Emerging Economies 
(Figure 2.1). 
4
 
Despite 
significantly 
lower income levels, total spending as a share of GDP is close to Western European 
standards, reflecting arguably 
historical reasons, 
geographic and cultural proximity
,
 
and a similar 
understanding of the role of government. There are
 
some differences 
within
 
CESEE: the Baltic 
countries and Turkey tend to spend somewhat less than Central (CEE) and South
-
Eastern (SEE) 
European countries, and also less than countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS). However, these differen
ces pale
 
compared to the discrepancies with 
public sectors in 
Latin 
America or Emerging Asia, both of which 
absorb much smaller shares of GDP
.

expenditure levels in CESEE are 
also 
close to those of Advanced Europe.
 
The exception is 
public investment, where CESEE economies outspend Advanced Europe 
by a substantial 
margin (as
 
a
 
share of potential GDP). Disaggregating spending by sub
-
region shows that 
Turkey differs from the rest of CESEE, with relatively smaller shares in transfers and public 
consumption, in line with
 
its smaller overall spending levels. Also in the Baltic count
ries, 
transfers are below the CESEE average.
 
Revenues.
 
The discrepancies with Advanced Europe are larger on the revenue side. CESEE 
governments tend to raise a higher share of revenue from consumption taxes

i.e. value 
added tax (VAT) and excises

than their
 
western European counterparts. By contrast, they 
raise less
 
from direct taxes on personal 
(PIT) 
and corporate income
 
(CIT)
. For taxes on 
personal income and property, the revenue yield in CESEE is less than half compared to that 
in Advanced Europe.
5
 
Consumption taxes are an important revenue source especially in 
Southeastern Europe
, where yields 
are 
almost double th
ose
 
of Advanced Europe. Turkey 
raises a relatively small share of revenue from social security contributions, in line with its 
lower level
 
of 
transfers
.

.1. Public Pension Spending and Pension Sustainability
1/
 
 
The challenges for pension systems in Emerging Europe (EE) resemble those in Advanced Europe (AE). 
Increasing 
life expectancy and falling fertility rates have triggered rapid population aging. In the EE EU Member 
States

where comparable da


the share of the 
working 
a
g
e population is expected to decline rapidly. W
hile currently about 1.5 workers support one pensioner, 
this is expected to be only one worker per pensioner in 2060 (for AE countries, the number of workers per 
pensioner will fall from 1.9 to 1.4). 
 
Progress with pension re
f
orm in Emerging Europe compare
s favorably with Advanced Europe. 
Many EE 
countries began to introduce pension reforms 
starting in the 
early 2000s. Although the path and pace of 
reforms differ across countries, most countries have reduced pension benefits, restricted early retirement, an
d 
increased the retirement age. As a result of these reforms, in m
ost
 
EE countries the net pension 
deficit
 
is 
projected to be less than 2 percent of GDP by 2060. At the same time, public pension spending is projected to 
fall
 
by Â¼ of a percentage point unti
l 2060.
6
 
A 
major
 
concern is social sustainability of the pensions system. 
A key element 
of
 
pension reform has been 
the reduction in pension benefits through parametric reforms. As a result, the level of pensions

already lower 
compared to AE

will decline further. Relative to wages, pension benefits are projected to fall on average by 10 
percenta
ge points until 2060. While such developments are unavoidable to render public pensions financially 
sustainable, in a few countries, the benefit ratio and gross replacement rate are projected to fall below 20 
percent in 2060. This looks unrealistic and rai
ses concerns about intergeneration
al
 
equity.

To ensure adequate retirement incomes in the future, EE policymakers should strive to raise the 
effective 
retirement age and encourage private savings.
 
Aligning the retirement age with life expectancy alone co

also be called for in individual cases. The development of private pension savings schemes should be

Differences in budget structures can reflect policy preferences, but also different structural 
characteristics of the underlying economies. 
For example, an open economy would typically 
raise a larger portion of revenues from (indirect) trade taxes than a c
losed economy. To separate 

with a model
-


that is, 
the budget one would expect from a country 
with identical structural characteristics. The model
-
based budget is computed from cross
-
country 
regressions covering 
76
 
advanced and em
erging economies (Annexes V and V
I for details).The 
regre
ssions suggest that 
per
-
capita GDP is
 
the most important 
correlate
 
of budget structures, 
with richer economies collecting more revenue from income taxes, and spending a relatively 
higher share of GDP on the public sector wage bill and on transfers. Other important 
correlates
 
are total GDP, openness, population density, age s
tructure, and resource wealth. 
 
 
Public spending in CESEE is generally higher than 
the various 
structural characteristics 
suggest

but especially so on transfers, public consumption, and other, unclassified 
expenses. 
On the revenue side, CESEE countries use particularly heavily social security contributions and 
consumption taxes. As CESEE, 
advanced
 
Europe spends more on transfers than its structural 
characteristics suggest, but

in contrast to CESEE

not on pub
lic consumption. On the revenue

What Makes a Budget Growth Friendly?
 
Context
 
The remainder of this chapter analyze
s
 

long
-
term growth. 
Before advancing, some remarks are in order to place the analysis in context. 
 

 
First, 
su
pporting growth is only one objective of fiscal policy. 
In particular, fiscal policy 
also pursues social and distributional objectives
 
that may or may not correlate with growth

t
he
 
link is complex. There can be conflicts: for instance, a shift from direct 
to indirect taxes 
reduces disincentives for work and savings, but it also decreases the amount of income 
redistribution through the tax system. Similarly, cuts in transfers can encourage labor 
participation but might worsen 
equity. Th
at
 
said, well
-
designed
 
f
iscal packages can mitigate 
such tra
de
-
offs (Cournede et al., 2014).
7
 
For example, if the proceeds of a regressive yet 
growth
-
enhancing tax reform are used to finance 
productive
 
spending, 
for example on 
education or health, 
the 
outcome may be higher growth and lower inequality (IMF, 2014
b
).
 
                                        
          
 
7
 
In general, expenditure
-
based fiscal consolidations are found to increase income inequality while revenue
-
based consolida
tions are rather neutral (Ball and others, 2013) or may even decrease inequality (Mulas
-
Granados, 
2005).

S
econd, 
growth friendliness has a long
-
 
and a short
-
term dimension
. In the short term, 
the impact of 
policies on 
aggregate demand 
can be more important than the structural 
aspects discussed here. Cuts in transfers, for example, can be detrimental to aggregate 
demand, even though they may improve labor market outcomes in the longer term. 
A
 
discussion of short
-
term demand stabilization
 
is be
yond the scope of this chapter
.  
 

 
Third, 
not only taxa
tion and spending levels matter
 
for growth but also the quality of 
government policy
 
and institutions
. On the revenue side, this includes issues such as tax 
expenditures and the quality of tax administration. On the expenditure side, 
spending

efficiency 
is critical
. Box 2.2
 
reports results for public infrastructure, health, and education. 
They 
point to re
latively strong education
al outcomes 
in CESEE
 
relative to the amount spent 
on public education
. This is less the case though for
 
health and public infrastructure (the 
latter with the exception of the Baltic countries). 
Thus, 

n 
public investment may
 
compensate 
in part for lower spending efficiency.
 
Theory
 
Economic theory offers some insights
 
into how budgetary policies can support growth 
(Anschauer, 1989; Barro and Sala
-
i
-
Martin, 1992;
 
Mendoza et al., 1997). 
 
For
 
government rev
enues
,
 
theory suggests that
, at an aggregate level, taxation 
of income 
tends 
to be 
more harmful 
to 
growth than taxation of consumption. 
 

 
Taxation of capital income
 
reduces the return on savings and investment, thus discouraging 
domestic investment, 
foreign
 
direct investment
 
and productivity improvement (
Hall and 
Jorgenson, 
1967; 
Lee and Gordon, 
2005). With capital being fairly mobile, high capital taxes 
can also drive corporate activity across borders
 
absent international cooperation
. Such tax 
arbitrage by 
multinational companies can be especially detrimental for emerging economies 
(
De Mooij and Ederveen, 2008
; 
Dharmapala, 
2014
; 
Crivelli, Keen and De Mooij, 2015). 
 

 
Labor taxes
 
can reduce both the demand for and supply of labor
.

Infrastructure.

lag Advanced Europe as regards the efficiency 
of 
public

Health.
 
H
ealth spending in CESEE countries is 
also 
less efficient than in Advanced Europe.
 
Further, the 
health expenditure efficiency in CESEE countries is at the lower end of emerging market economies. Some 
SEE countries have higher efficiency with a very low lev
el of expenditure. CIS countries have the most room 
to improve efficiency.
 

 
Education. 
By contrast, education expenditure in CESEE countries is relatively efficient. Turkey (and to a 
lesser extent the SEE region) is close to the efficient frontier, with relatively low levels of education 
spending. Many Baltics and CEE countries have similar 
educational 
scores as Advanced Europe, but achieve 
this with a significantly lower education expenditures.

. Taxes on 
P
roperty
1/
 
Property taxes are widely regarded as an 
efficient and equitable means of raising 
revenue, but with a revenue potential 
that is largely untapped in many 
countries. 
Property taxes generally
 
yield 
relatively modest revenue, particularly in 
developing economies, but there are also 
large disparities across countries that signal 
a potential for enhanced utilization 
(Norregaard, 2013). In CESEE, revenue 
collection
2
/
 
from property taxes in 2012/13 
averaged 0.7 percent of GDP, similar to that 
in d
eveloping countries, but less than half of 
that in advanced economies. There is no 
evidence either of any CESEE catch
-
up to 
advanced European countries in property 
tax collection. Since 1990, collection has 
increased by about Â½ a percentage point of 
GDP in
 
both country groups.
 
 
Recurrent taxes on land and buildings 
have a small adverse effect on economic 
growth, though are unpopular.
 
These 
taxes do not affect the decisions of 
economic agents to supply labor, to 
produce or invest to the extent as some 
other 
taxes.  Another advantage of property 
taxes is that the tax base is more stable 
making its revenue more predictable, partly 
due to less cyclical fluctuation in property 
values (Joumard and Kongsrud, 2003). Also, 
as real estate and land are highly visible a
nd 
immobile these taxes are more difficult to evade, and the immovable nature of the tax base may be 
particularly appealing in the context of increasing tax competition. There is, however, a widespread popular 
and hence political resistance to their increa
sed use stemming in part from their transparency and relatively 
limited scope for tax avoidance and evasion.
 
 
Recent reform proposals in CESEE entail significant revenue potential.
 
Latvia
 
introduced a residential 
property tax on buildings in 2010 to comple
ment the existing land tax. Kosovo has recently introduced a 
more efficient and accurate cadastre. 
Serbia
 
plans to replace the system of taxes based on property rights 
in tandem with a planned land privatization reform. In 
Croatia, a plan to 
introduce a 
new ad valorem 

being considered.

Due to data availability, the revenue figures 
relate to total revenue from property taxes, which may also include 
for some countries, recurrent taxes on net (of debt) wealth; taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts; financial and 
capital transaction taxes, or sales of immovable property.

By contras
t, 
subsidies
 
can distort the allocation of resources and therefore harm growth. 
Transfers 
such as unemployment benefits, especially when poorly designed, can reduce 
employment incentives and worsen labor market outcomes (Meyer, 2002; Abbring and 
others, 2005; OECD, 2006). 
 
 

 
There are no clear theoretical priors for 
spending on goods and service
s

that is,
 
public 
consumption. Public consumption 
is

d of
 
basic administrative services that 
economies need to operate efficiently, as well as education and healthcare spending. 
Excessive levels of public consumption can be inefficient and growth

Empirics
 
 
To 
arrive at a quantifiable framework, 
e
mpirical analysis 
complements 
the 
findings identified 
by theory
. The results are based on 
panel regressions that relate real per
-
capita GDP growth to a 

cyclically adjusted 
reven
ue and ex
penditure structure
, following 
the
 
approach 
introduced by Kneller et 
a
l

Regressions are
 
performed acro
ss 
broad expenditure and revenue categories as reported in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) 
database. This 
approach yields some broad insights, but it also has limitations:
 

 
Cyclical adjustment 
of fiscal data is
 
critical 
t
o prevent reverse causality from growth to 
revenue and expenditure categories. Data 
for all budget categories 
are adjusted using a 
methodology
 
proposed by Bornhorst et al. (2011)
. The methodology allows for robustness 
checks by varying the elasticities of budget categories to the business cycle; as another 
check, re
gressions are estimated with
 
GMM and
 
instrumental variable techniques. This said
,
 
t
here can still be 
feedback
 
if
 
adjustment is imperfect or in the presence of 
within
-
year fiscal 
policy reactions to developments in growth.
 

 

average
 
patterns
 
across expenditure and revenue 
categories. Especially on 
the spending side, th

abstract
s
 
from 
composition
 
within
 
these 
categories: for example the share of public consumption spent on productive uses such as 
education or health, or the composition of the capital budget

although 
these issues are 
likely relevant
 
for growth. 
More detailed expenditure categorizations
, and/or a breakdown of 
expenditures by functional categories,
 
would be desirable but are not available
 
consistently 
across countries
. 
On the revenue side, low yields from certain taxes can reflect low tax rates, 
large tax exemptions, or poor revenue administration

factors that have arguably different 
growth implications, but cannot be distinguished here.

I
n line with the treatment 
in Kneller et al. (1999)
, regressions are
 
run separately for each revenue
 
(expenditure)
 
category and control for total expenditures
 
(total revenues)
. The implicit assumption is that an increase in one 
revenue
 
(expenditure)
 
category is, in the long run, offset by a reduction in the other revenue
 
(
expenditure)
 
categories. The coefficients should thus not be interpreted as the direct, marginal impact of an increase in a 
revenue
 
(expenditure) category on growth.

Further, to keep the empirical m
odel tractable it is 
linearized. 
Hence it abstracts from issues 
like returns to scale (
for example, 
the possibility that public investment may become 
gradually less growth effecti
ve with larg
er amounts of investment). 
 
With these limitations in mind, 
the 
r
esults
 
point in the following directions:
 

 
Revenues. 
Co
rporate income taxes and social security contributions correlate negatively with 
growth in CESEE, as suggested by theory. 
By contrast, neither consumption nor property 
taxes correlate significantly with
 
growth. 
Interestingly, p
ersonal income tax 
is
 
also 
not
 
associated with a significant negative growth effect
, which is 
in line with previous findings
 
(Lee and Gordon, 
2005; Federe and Dahlby, 2012).
 
A growth
-
oriented revenue reform
 
in CESEE 
economies would
 
therefore shift 
the revenue base away from corporate income tax and 
social security contributions, and toward consumption taxes, property taxes, and personal 
income tax.
10
 
 

 
Expenditures.
 
On the spending side, 
transfers
 
and public consumption
 
in CESEE 
are 
significantly negatively correlated with
 
growth
 
(Annex Table VII. 1)
. The point estimate for 
public employment is also (slightly) negative but insignificant. By contrast, public investment 
is positively associated
 
with 
growth.

A shift 
from corporate to personal income taxes 
can improve efficiency (Johansson et al.
, 2008) while also 
improving income distribution (IMF, 2014)
.

The coefficient is substantially lower than fiscal multipliers typically found for public investment, for example 
IMF (2014). This is by design: the focus here is, in contrast to multiplier studies, on investment increases 
offset
 
by 
cuts in other public s
pending categories.

How Does Emerging Europe Score?
 
 
With this,
 
the elem
ents are in place to comp
ile
 
an index 
capturing
 
the growth friendliness 

 
The index multiplies the growth coefficients from above 
(Annex Table VII.1 
and 2) 
with the deviations
 
of the actual from the predic
ted budget structure (Annex Table
 
VI. 1)
, 
then sums all revenue/expenditure categories. 
 
Importantly,
 
the index is relative:
 

structure is more 
long
-
term 
growth friendly than that of its peers
 
(
that is, 
countries with 
identical struc
tural characteristics), and vice versa. Further, and in line with the standard 
treatment in the literature, revenue and expenditure structures are analyzed separately. As these 
structures are not necessarily independent 
o
f one another

for example, higher s
ocial security 
contributions typically go hand in hand with higher 
transfers

the results for expenditures and 
revenues are 
not
 
added up
, in order
 
to avoid double counting. The analysis is done for 2008

i.e., 
at 
the onset of the global financial crisis

and 
for 2014, 
which is 
the latest 
information available
.
 
 
The results show that 
CESEE economies entered the global financial crisis with relatively 
growth unfriendly budget structures 
(Figure 2.5).

expenditure side

Fiscal Adjustment in CESEE, 2008

14
 
In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008
-
09, many CESEE countries went 
through 
sizable fiscal adjustment
 
(Figure 2.6). As global financial
 
conditions tightened

even cutting 
some countries off external financing for a period

funding large deficits became more difficult. 
Further, the end to credit
-
fueled, domestic demand driven
 
growth triggered a re
-
assessment of 
growth prospects, implying that many countries needed a tighter long
-
term fiscal stance than 
previously thought. 
 
 
Structural fiscal adjustment varied across sub
-
regions.
 
The Baltic countries adjusted the most, 
followed
 
by 
Southeastern Europe

with a wide variety of outcomes

and Central Europe. In 
Romania, Lithuania, Estonia and Bosnia 
and
 
Herzegovina, structural fiscal adjustment exceeded 
 
5 percentage points of GDP. In Latvia and Hungary, adjustment exceeded 5 percent
ag
e points of 
potential GDP
 
for 
2008
-
12, but some of this was reversed in 2013/14. Also in Croatia, the Czech 
Republic, and Ukraine structural fiscal adjustment was more than 3 percent. In all countries with 
very large adjustments, the effort was heavily fro
ntloaded, often

but not always

in the context 
of IMF
-
supported programs (Romania, Bosnia
 
and
 
Herzegovina
, Latvia, Hungary, Ukraine). 
Annex 
VIII
 
contains a detailed description of country experiences with large adjustments. 
 
 
Structural adjustment was, for 
the most part, expenditure
-
led. 
 

 
The structural primary balance improve
d
 
in 14 o
ut of the 17 CESEE economies covered by 
this analysis, 
and in 
9 of these, the structural reduction in spending
 
was larger than the 
structural increase in revenues
. 
For all very
 
large adjusters identified above

Romania, 
Lithuania, Estonia, Bosnia
 
and Herzegovina

consolidation was clearly expenditure
-
led, with 
structural spending cuts of 5 percent of GDP or more.

occurred in Turkey and 
the Slovak Republic. In both cases, however, higher revenues financed in large part higher 
spending (of about 2Â½ of GDP) instead of contributing to c

(overall) adjusters, 
consolidation was revenue

revenue structures
 
(Figure 2.7). On the revenue side, the yield from direct taxes

on 
personal 
and, especially, 
corporate income

fell, for all sub
-
regions except Turkey. 
In the CIS and CEE 
countries, t
h
e loss in CIT receipts often reflected cuts in tax rates

see Box 2.
4
 
for 
a
 
survey. 
However, in the Baltic and SEE countries, the (structurally adjusted) yield from CIT fell 
without
 
a 
corresponding cut in 
tax rates. This points to structural 
shift
s
 
in the

 
tax bases

notably the sustained decline in the 
construction
 
s
ector that occurred in most CESEE countries in 
the wake of the global financial crisis, and structural declines in the profitability of financial

This result is highly robust and 
not
 
driven by
 
insufficient cyclical adjustment: even doubling the elasticity of CIT 
to GDP compared to the base specification (1.5) does not materially change the result.

ic investment, with Hungary, 
Lithuania and Slovenia managing to even 
increase
 
capital spending, despite fiscal 
consolidation.

At the other end of the spectrum, Ukraine, Croatia, Romania and Serbia cut

more, often motivating these cuts 
with insufficient prioritization and therefore inefficiency of public investment.  
 

 
Current spending.
 
The spending category with the largest consolidation was the 
public sector 
wage bill.
 
Cuts averaged 1 percent of potent
ial GDP across CESEE, exceeding 2 percent of 
potential GDP in Latvia, Romania, Lithuania, and Hungary. These reductions were achieved 
through a mix of public sector wage cuts (up to 25 percent in Romania), including through 
the elimination of extra payment
s such as 13
th
 
month salaries (Hungary), and reductions in 
public employment.

Revenue reforms have been a key component 
in
 

A study 
of changes in tax rates allows 
for  
analyzing policy changes while abstracting from underlying structural or 
cyclical (and incompletely corrected) changes in the economy.
 
 
 

 
Most CESEE countries 
have 
raised 
VAT rates
 
since 2008. In the Baltic and CEE countries, the VAT rate 
increased on 
average by close to 3 percentage points, although in SEE and CIS countries the increase 
has been about 1Â½ percentage points. This compares to an average VAT rate increase of 2 percentage 
points in 
A
dvanced Europe. In terms of levels, VAT rates in Baltic an
d CEE countries tend to be slightly 
higher than in 
A
dvanced Europe (21.9 percent on average vs. 21.1 percent, while in SEE and CIS 
countries they are lower 
 
at 
19.8 percent.
 

 
Despite fiscal consolidation efforts,
 
tax rates on corporate profits
 
(CIT) 
have fa
llen in several 
countries, notably in CIS and CEE countries. CIT rates in CESEE are low compared to advanced Europe 
(15.9 percent vs. 25 percent in 2014).
 

 
Labor taxes
 
remain high. At 39.2 percent, the average labor tax wedge in CESEE (from personal 
income tax and social security contributions) exceeds that in advanced Europe 
 
(38.2 percent).
15
 
Since 2008, the tax wedge has on average increased by less than Â½ of a percen
tage 
point. This is significantly less than the increase of more than 2 percentage points in advanced Europe.

Further, several countries consolidated 
transfers, 
with cuts exceeding 2 percentage points of 
potential GDP in Hungary, Bosnia
 
and Herzegovina
, and Lithuania. There is no coherent 
cross

country pattern on the transfer categories most affected; examples inc
lude public

including by curtailing pensions for privileged groups

maternity benefits, and, in 
the case of Bosnia, transfers to war veterans.

How 
Growth Friendly 
Were Budget Changes
? 
 
Evaluating these changes with 
the 
help of the empirical model described above suggests that
 

 
non
-
tax revenues improved the 
revenue structure, 
as the tax burden shifted from taxes considered harmful to growth to 
broadly growth neutral forms of taxation
 
(Figure 2.8)
. This pattern shows up in all sub
-
regions 
except Turkey (where large increases in social security contributions worsened the revenue 
structure). On a country
-
by
-
country basis, the model
-
based analysis suggests that 10 of 17 CESEE 
economies improved their 
revenue structures 
over 
2008

As mentioned earlier, a consistent cross

limited (these numbers arguably include both public consumption and investment).

As for expenditures, t
he divergent patterns of consolidation 
translate into
 
different 
estimated 
long
-
term growth
 
effects
.
 
As 
C
entral European and Baltic countries 
reduced 
primarily 
current 
expenditures while preserving capital spending, their spending structures 
typically improved. By contrast, 
in 
Southeastern Europe
 
and the CIS countries
,
 
public investment 
fell s
ignificantly, causing the expenditure structure to become less growth supportiv
e
. 
Overall, 
 
6 of 17 countries improved their spending structures.
 
 
Quality and Size of
 
Fiscal Consolidation 
 
Does the size of 
fiscal adjustment 
affect its quality
? And is expenditure

requires
 
shifts
 
in 
revenues away from 
categories
 
like
 
corporate income tax and social security contributions to consumption tax
 
personal income tax, or property tax. In CESEE, such shifts occurred only when revenue

2Â½ percentage points of

On the 
expenditure side
,
 
cuts in public investment render adjustment growth unfriendly. 
In 
CESEE, l
arge consolidation did 
not
 
come with
 
disproportionate cuts in investment. Instead, 
large adjusters realized savings 
primarily 
by curtailing public consumption and 
transfers

steps that ultimately enhanced the growth friendliness
 
of their budgets, 
all else being
 
equal.
 

the results suggest that 
 
the scope for growth friendly revenue
-
based consolidation is lim
ited.
 
L
arge adjustment 
s
hould therefore 
contain 
a significant portion of spending
-
side measures
, in particular in 
countries where overall spending levels are high
.
 
K
ey 
T
akeaways from the 
A
nalysis
 
Despite severe fiscal consolidation pressures in the wake of
 
the global financial crisis, 
many CESEE countries managed to avoid deteriorations in their budgetary structures. 
 

 
On the revenue side,
 
most countries were faced with large structural losses on corporate 
income tax, but managed to over
-
compensate for this 
by increasing revenues from less 
growth
-
harmful
 
forms 
of 
taxation
, in particular value added taxes.
 
 

 
On the spending side,
 
the Baltic and Central European countries typically managed to resist 
large cuts in public investment, reflecting in part the availability of EU structural funds. Large 
fiscal savings came instead from reforming entitlement programs and cutting public 
con
sumption. 
Consolidation 
i
n SEE and CIS countries, by contrast, resorted more to cuts in 
capital spending.
 

 
I
n 
Turkey
, both government spending and revenue 
grew in cyclically adjusted terms
, 
yielding 
som
e deterioration in 
the 
budget structure. However, in co
ntrast to much of the rest of 

, in terms of its broad orientation,
 
remains relatively growth friendly compared to peers
.
 
Looking ahead, sizeable fiscal policy challenges remain
 
in CESEE

and this c

contains several recommendations how to address these. 
 
 
 

 
Fiscal consolidation has not yet run its course, especially in 
SEE
. 
 
For c
ountries with sizable 
remaining 
fiscal adjustment needs
, the focus should be 
on 
reducing unproductive 
transfer and subsidies, and on further reforming entitlement 
programs, including public pension systems that absorb a large share of resources in CESEE
.
 
Restructuring the public sector may also be called for where the public sector wage bill is 
high, eithe
r because of excessive employment or disproportionately high public sector 
wages. Countries with access to EU structural and cohesion funds should seek to leverage 
these so as to avoid cuts in public investment.
 
 
On the revenue side, 
p
olicy makers 
should f
ocus on achieving 
a sizable part of adjustment 
through indirect taxes

notably VAT
, especially when existing VAT rates are modest 
CESEE REI FALL 2015
 
INTERNATIONAL MONETA
RY FUND
      
44
 
compared 
with those of
 
peers

and give consideration to the introduction or strengthening 
of
 
carbon and property taxes. 
On incom
e taxes, broadening tax bases by e
liminating tax 
expenditures
 
while reducing marginal rates is a priority. 
 

 
For
 
countries that do not have 
urgent 
fiscal 
consolidation
 
needs, 
fiscal reform is still 
called for to enhance the quality and growth
-
friendliness o
f their budgets.
 
 
o
 
Where 
corporate income taxes
 
are high, governments should seek to bring rates more in 
line with peers. 
If
 
distributional aspects are a concern, a relatively growth friendly option 
is to 
eliminate instead exemptions from 
personal income ta
x. 
 
o
 
While CESEE

 
high 
transfers
 
arguably reflect a conscious policy choice in favor of equity, 
financing a larger portion from general taxation, particularly 
indirect taxes
, instead of 
social security contributions would enhance the growth friendliness of the welfare state. 
A careful design is needed for social security contributions and their interaction with the 
withdrawal of social transfers upon taking up work, to avoid 
employment and poverty 
traps.
 
o
 
G
rowth friendly fiscal reform should seek to 
enhance the amount and efficiency of health 
and capital 
spending
, while limiting unproductive transfers and subsidies.
 

 
Finally, it is worth recalling that 
there are many issues crit
ical for the quality of fiscal 
policy that go beyond this chapter
,
 
but are covered in detail in other IMF publications 
(including IMF, 2014c, 2015a,c). These include: (i) enhancing spending efficiency, especially 
on health and public infrastructure; (ii) i
mproving the design of fiscal policies, notably the 
careful calibration of transfers to limit any negative impact on labor supply; (iii) improving the 
composition of spending 
within
 
expenditure categories, such as protecting spending on 
health and educatio
n within public consumption; and (iv) strengthening budget institutions 
to deliver more growth
-
friendly fiscal consolidation.

and their exposure 
to external risks:
 

 
Where the recovery is well advanced
, the policy priorities need to increasingly shift toward the 
medium term, including rebuilding fiscal buffers and continuing with reforms to improve the 
business environment and address structural weak
nesses. 
This is not to deny that there is still 
a lot of
 
uncertainty about the strength of global recovery that, domestically, inflation is still 
too low in many CESEE economies, and that 
the 
key crisis legacies

high NPLs and debt 
overhangs 

still need f
urther work
 
(notably in SEE)
.
  
 

 
For economies that are 
in recession
 
(Russia and other CIS countries)
, the key challenge is t
o 
steer the adjustment to terms
-
of
-
trade and other shocks with a view to supporting weak 
internal demand and reducing high 
inflation.
 

 
Countries
 
vulnerable to external shocks

such as 
those with large e
xternal financing needs,
 
weak fiscal positions or high
 
dependence on commodity exports

need to be prepared to 
deal with market pressures by using exchange rate flexibility as 
a 
sh
ock absorber (Russia, 
Turkey) alongside macroprudential policies to contain the build

Fiscal C
hallenges
 
 
Despite improvements in their budgetary structures, CESEE countries face 
significant fiscal
 
challenges
. 
Most 
CESEE countries still face
 
siz
able adjustment needs to stabilize debt levels 
and/or return to full compliance with the 

 
fiscal
 
rules
. The need for further consolidation 
tends to be 
large
r
 
in SEE. 
The analysis 
in 
this report offers some
 
insights
.
 
 
Countries with sizable fiscal 
adjustment needs
 
(mostly in SEE
;
 
Figu
re 3.2) could achieve more 
growth
-
friendly fiscal consolidat
ion via 
cutbacks in subsidies and tax 
incentives, reforms to entitlement 
programs
,
 
and the introduction or 
strengthening of modern property tax 
regimes. In a number of economies, 
tax compliance and admin
istration 
need to be improved. 
At the same 
time, prod
uctive public investment 
should be shielded from cuts. EU 
member states should increase the 
absorption of EU funds and increase 
their 
focus on projects that could 
better enhance potential growth.
 
 
Countries that do not have urgent 
consolidation needs
 
could
 
concentrate their efforts on improving their budgetary structures
. This would involve
 
reducing 
corporate income taxes
 
in line with peers or 
re
placing
 
corporate income taxation with increased 
personal income taxation,
 
especially for higher earners;
 
financing a larger portion 
of social 
spending 
from general taxation, particularly 
the 
VAT, instead of social security contributions
; and 
taking steps 
to 
enhance the amount and efficiency of health and capital spending
,
 
while limiting 
unproductive transfer
s and subsidies.

Addressing
 
high NPLs and debt overhangs 
requires a comprehensive approach
.
 
A recent 
IMF study 
on the causes and consequences of 
persistently high NPL
s
 
in Europe 
(
Aiyar and others 
2015) 
finds that the weak economic recovery is only part of the story and that the underlying 
reasons are often deep rooted.  
A new survey of European country authorities and banks
 
shows 
that deficiencies in 
the legal framework and
 
underdeveloped distressed debt
 
markets are, on 
average, seen as the 
most severe obstacles to 
distressed debt 
resolution in
 
countries with 
high 
NPL
 
levels across
 
Europe.

For SEE countries, obstacles to NPL

regarded
 
as more

(Figure 3.3). Furthermore, 
different obstacles 
tend to be 
interlinked, with difficulties in one 
area compounding challenges in 
others.
 
Thus, resolving high NPLs 
requires a comprehensive strategy 
that includes tightened

A cyclical adjustment was applied to revenues/expenditures following the disag
gregated 
approach proposed in Bornhorst and others (2011)
.  The purpose of cyclical adjustment is to 
decompose the overall balance into cyclical and cyclically adjusted components:
 
 
OB = CB + CAB
 
 
 
 
 
(1)
 
 
where 
OB 
is the overall balance, 
CB 
is the cyclical balance (the part of the fiscal overall balance that 
automatically reacts to the business cycle), and 
CAB 
is the cyclically adjusted balance (the part of the 
overall balance that is left after cyclical movements are taken out), expressed in
 
nominal terms. The 
disaggregated approach computes the cyclically adjusted balance as a function of individual cyclically 
adjusted revenue and expenditure categories:
 
 





















 
(2)
 
 
where 



 
represents the cyclically adjusted component of the 
i
-
th 
revenue category, 
G
CA 
represents 
cyclically adjusted primary expenditures, while 
R
NCA
 
and 
G
NCA
 
contain all revenue/ expenditure 
categories that do not require cyclical adjustment (Girouard and Andre,
 
2005). 
 
 
On the revenue side, the elasticity of each revenue category can be decomposed into two 
factors. 
The output elasticity of tax revenue (

Ri,Y
) is the product of the elasticity of tax revenues (
R
i
), 
with respect to the relevant tax base (
B
i
),

RiBi
, and the elasticity of the tax base relative to the output 
gap, 

Bi,Y
:
 

Ri,Y
 
= 

RiBi

 

Bi,Y
 
 
 
 
 
(3
)
 
 
Applying this decomposition to the computation of cyclically adjusted revenue yields:
 
 
                                    





















 
 
 
 
 
(4)
 
 
Assuming, or deriving, the value of the tax elasticity with respect to its base is the first step.
 
In addition to statutory tax rates, derivation also requires knowledge of the income distribution. The 
second step is an econometric estimation 
of the sensitivity of the relevant tax bases with respect to 
the output gap. This requires specifying macroeconomic proxies for the tax bases. For income taxes 
and social security contributions a common proxy is the wage bill, for corporate income taxes, t
he tax 
base is a measure of corporate profits, whereas private consumption serves as a base for indirect 
taxes. With these two elasticities at hand, the elasticities of tax revenue with respect to the output gap 
can be computed. The resulting elasticities 
of revenue categories with respect to the output gap are 
usually larger than one for income taxes (reflecting progressivity), around one for indirect taxes

(reflecting generally flat indirect (VAT) tax rates), and somewhat smaller than one for social secur
ity 
contributions. For practical reasons, the elasticities of the several revenue components with respect to 
the output gap were drawn from Girouard and Andre (2005), taking the mid
-
point of their estimated 
elasticities. As such, we assume an elasticity of
 
1.3 for personal income taxes, of 1.5 for taxes on 
corporate profits, of 0.7 for social security contributions, and of 1 for indirect taxes, including taxes on 
goods and services and property tax.
 
 
Similarly on the expenditure side, the elasticities can a
lso be decomposed into two factors. 
Current transfers

in particular unemployment benefits

are most likely to display a cyclical behavior 
owing to the benefit system. In contrast, nominal spending on other items such as wages and goods 
and services or capit
al spending is likely to be largely independent of the business cycle, not requiring 
any adjustment. As with revenues, the elasticities of expenditure with respect to the base can be 
assumed or derived. For simplicity, we only adjust the expenditure on soc
ial benefits, assuming an 
elasticity of 
-
0.5. For all other expenditure categories, the elasticity relative to the output gap is 
assumed to be zero.
 
All results in the chapter are robust to changes in elasticities.

Annex VI. Budget Structures and Country Characteristics

To compare the budget structure of CESEE countries with that of comparator countries, 
expenditure and revenue categories are regressed on structural country characteristics. 
Using 
the sample 
of countries defined in Annex V
, we estimate equations of the for

where the index

are respectively country

indicators. In Eq. (1), 
Fiscal
 
is a set of cyclically
-
adjusted expenditure and revenue variables, expressed relative to potential 
GDP, and 
X
 
is a set economic characteristics. In order to assess changes to the budget structure since 
the global financial crisis, Eq. (1) is estimated for two separate years: 2008 and 2014. 
 
Revenue
s
 
and expenditure, taken from the World Economic Outlook (WEO) Dat
abase, refer to 
consolidated general government, and are cyclically adjusted in percent of potential GDP.
 
In 

were used to fill gaps in the data series. For s
pending categories, four categories are considered in 
addition 
to 
total spending: public consumption of goods and services, compensation of employees, 
transfer
s
, and capital spending. For revenues, four categories are considered on top of total revenues: 
t
axes on corporate profits (CIT), taxes on goods and services, social security contributions, and the 
personal income tax (PIT).
 
Structural country characteristics are from the World Development 
Indicator Database: GDP per capita (in 2005 USD, PPP), log of 
GDP, dependency ratio (the ratio of 
depen
dents

people
 
younger than 15 or older than 64

to
 
the working

age population

those
 
ages

to
 
GDP), population 
density (number of people per sq
. 
k
m.
 
of land area), and natural resource rents (in percent of GDP). 
 
Annex Table VI
.1 below presents the results for spending and revenue categories.
 
Per capita 
GDP is generally found positively and statistically significantly correlated with expenditure and
 

increases the demand for public services in reflection of a higher degree of economic and institutional 
sophistication, also requiring higher government reven
ues. The negative coefficient on public 
investment could, in turn, reflect structural economic transformation (e.g. Turrini (2004)). Economy 
size (log GDP) appears to be negatively correlated with public investment, but has strong positive 
correlation with
 
revenues from social contributions and expenses related to 
transfers.
 
In addition a 
high dependency ratio tends to be associated with lower expenditure and lower revenues from 
consumption taxes. Coefficient estimates on trade openness are mostly statistically insignificant, 
except for revenues from social contributions, whi
ch may reflect higher demand for social insurance 
against external risks in more open economies (e.g. Rodrik (1998)). Population density matters 
according to the empirical results: higher population density could imply higher urbanization of the 
economy wh
ich helps improve efficiency of public sector operation. Resource rich economies have

different budget structures that are broadly reflected in the estimated coefficients: on the revenue side, 
resource-rich economies tend to collect less from non-resource tax revenues (Crivelli and Gupta, 2014), 
except for the CIT tax on companies operating in natural resource sectors. On the expenditure side, there is 

usually high infrastructure investment needs from natural resource sectors.  
The residuals from the estimated equations on revenue and expenditure components are used to 
assess budget structures in CESEE relative to their structural characteristics.
 On the expenditure side, 
current spending (wages and consumption of goods and services) is relatively high in CESEE as compared to 


ristics, except for Turkey. When assessing the 
changes over time, however, both categories of spending
in particular the public sector wage bill
shows a significant drop in SEE, CIS, and Baltic countries from 2008 to 2014. As for public investment, its level in 

2008 appears particularly high in SEE and Turkey, with SEE, CIS, and Baltic countries experiencing a 

significant drop over time. Transfers, however, have remained high among CEE, SEE, and CIS countries. On 
the revenue side, many CESEE countries except for CIS countries managed to increase their reliance on taxes

nary least squares with country and time 
fixed effects (OLS
-
FE). The long
-
term effect of different fiscal variables on growth is captured by 










. 
 
We also investigate whether the effect of revenues and expenditures on growth differs across 
regions
 
by
 
interacting the variable of interest with regional dumm
ies for CESEE and Advanced Europe
.
 
As described in Kneller et al. (1999), when estimating the impact of each spending category on output 
growth, an omitted variable represent
s
 
the underlying
 
assumption about how to finance the additional 
expenditure. In all cases, the omitted variables are the reminder of the public expenditures. Similarly for 
revenues, the omitted variables are the remaining public revenues.
 
Data are cyclically adjusted, int
er alia to 
prevent reverse causality from growth to revenue/expenditure categories
. Feedback effects cannot be 
excluded as cyclical adjustment is difficult to get right, e
specially for corporate taxes
. R
esults could also 
capture things like governments adj
usting budgets in response to high/low growth
. This said, 
results do not 
change materially when 
var
ying the set of 
elasticities used 
in cyclical adjustment, and neither 
when 
using 
Blundell and Bond (1998) system generalized method of moments estimator (GMM
) instead of OLS
-
FE.
 
The fiscal variables, taken from the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database, refer to consolidated 
general government and are expressed as ratios to GDP.
 

Revenue database and Article IV consultation reports were used to fill gaps in the data series. For spending 
categories, five categories are considered: public consumption (purchase/use of goods and service
s), 
compensation of employees, 
transfers
, capital spending, and other expense. For revenues, 
seven
 
categories 
are considered: taxes on corporate profits (CIT), taxes on labor income (PIT), taxes on goods and services, 
taxes on property, social contribution
s, other tax revenues, and other (non
-
tax) revenue.
 
In addition, we have included six control variables
: labor force (as a growth rate), private investment (in 
percent of GDP), terms of trade (as a growth rate constructed from an index series in which the 
year 2000 
takes the value 100), population (growth rate), oil rents (in percent of GDP), and the overall budget balance 
(in percent of GDP). The inclusion of the production factors related to capital increase (proxied by private 
investment) and labor force
 
growth follows from the related literature. Population growth may explain 
output growth. Several studies have suggested the relevance of terms of trade (Odedokun, 2001; Bose et al., 
2003; Gupta et al., 2005). Oil rents are included to capture potential ne
gative influence of natural
-
resource 
revenues on domestic revenues and expenditures (Crivelli and Gupta, 2014). The unit specific term in our 
panel model 

i
 
takes into account the effect of time

In order to assess the overall growth friendliness of 
CESEE 
government budget structures, 
additional 
assumptions are needed to indentify the marginal impact of revenue and expenditure components 
on long
-
term growth.
 
Given the omitted variable assumption used in estimating Eq. (1) above (controlling 
for total revenue and total expenditure, as we
ll as for the overall budget balance), the parameter estimates 
of the expenditure and revenue components cannot be directly interpreted as the marginal impact on 
growth. For example, the impact of a one percentage point increase of a given expenditure comp
onent 
implies in the regressions, a drop of equivalent size in other expenditure components. As a result, the 
estimated coefficients can only be interpreted as the net impact (net of the impact of reducing other 
expenditure components) on long
-
term growth.
 
 
We make the following assumptions in order to identify the marginal impact of expenditure and 
revenue components on long
-
term growth
21
:
 
 

 
When computing the net growth impact, the compensating change of other expenditure (revenue) 
components is equally dis
tributed among other expenditure (revenue) components.
 
 

 
The sum of the marginal impact of expenditure (revenue) components on long term economic 
growth is zero.
 
 
With these additional assumptions, and the estimated coefficients from the regressions on expe
nditure and 
revenue components above, a system of equations can be solved separately for revenue (expenditure) 
components that allows identification of the estimated marginal effects. This transformation results, as 
expected, in marginal effects on long
-
te
rm growth that are consistently lower (in absolute value) than the 
estimated coefficients above.
 
 
                                        
          
 
21
 
For this analysis, we focus on four expenditure components (wage, goods and services, investment, and 
transfers
), 
and four revenue components (taxes on goods and services, CIT, PIT, 
and social contributions). Total expenditure 
(revenue) is equal to the sum of the four expenditure (revenue) components plus other expenditure (revenue).

Annex VIII. Large Fiscal Consolidations: Country Experiences
22
 
 
Several CESEE countries underwent sizeable consolidation in the wake of the global financial crisis. This Annex 
summarizes the main policies taken in countries with 
the largest fiscal efforts. Overall, many measures went into a 
growth
-
friendly direction, broadly corroborating the findings of the quantitative analysis. That said, they also 
comprised spending measures that came with hardship for certain segments of the 
population. Some revenue 
measures

such as sector
-
specific taxes

may be turn out to be harmful to growth.
 
Romania
 
Fiscal consolidation started in 2009 in the context of an IMF supported program. Adjustment focused on 
expenditure consolidation, seeking to co
ntain entitlement and wage costs through cuts in wages and social 
transfers, parametric reforms to the pension system, including the removal of special pension regimes, and the 
introduction of a unified wage setting system. 
 
 
Structural fiscal reforms comp
lemented consolidation, including on the pension system, tax administration, 
and the public wage framework. A Fiscal Responsibility Law was enacted to streamline budgeting. A multi
-
year 
public financial management structure was introduced while limiting in
tra
-
year budget revisions. Fiscal rules 
were introduced to regulate spending, public debt, and the primary deficit. A framework for managing 
guarantees and other contingent liabilities was approved. The local public finance law was amended to bolster 
fisca
l discipline. Reform implementation was uneven though, particularly in the areas of revenue 
administration and health care reform.
 
Main measures:
 

 
Wage bill cut
 
(2 percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted)
: 
A key objective was to reduce the public 
sect
or wage bill back to the 2007 level through a 25 percent cut in public wages. 
Public employment 
was reduced 
by about 
16
 
percent
. The resulting 
public wage bill
 
in 2014 was
 
consistent with the 7 
percent of GDP cap set 

Fiscal 
Strategy
.
 

 
Capital spending cut 
(2Â½ percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted): 
efficiency of 

high 
capital spending had been 
compromised by 
the lack of 
a robust framework and capacity for developing, 
prioritizing, and executing public
-
investment projects. Cuts to capital spending 
focused on 
non
-
priority, 
inefficient projects
. In recent years the focus has shifted 
to improve absorption of EU funds, 
by 
stre
ngthening
 
targeting rules and public procurement.
 

 
Transfer cuts 
(0.1 percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted): A parametric reform to the pension 
system was an essential pillar for long
-
term fiscal sustainability, including also the removal of specia
l 
pension regimes. 
Short
-
term budgetary impact was only marginal, however, with the focus on 
preserving the scope and size of the safety net system (social protection).
 

 
Revenue increases:
 
Only 1/3 of the adjustment was 
achieved
 
through revenue measures, 
mo
stly 
explained by an increase to the VAT rate from 19 to 24 percent that 
triggered an increase in yields 
of

about 1 percent of GDP. Th
e
 
modest revenue increase relative to the large VAT rate hi
ke is explained by 
a weak revenue administration
.
 
Estonia
 
 
Reflecting the early onset of the crisis in Estonia, fiscal consolidation started early in 2008. Supplementary 
budgets in February and June of 2009 contained consolidation measures of 7Â½ percent. Many measures were 
on the revenue side, such as VAT increase
s and higher excise taxes. Other measures included social benefit 
reductions, cuts in operational spending, as well as land sales and discretionary spending cuts. Overall, the 
efforts led to a 2009 fiscal deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP (in ESA terms), which
 
helped paving the way for euro 
adoption in 2011.
 
 
 
Main measures: 
 
 

 
Wage bill and consumption spending cuts
 
(2 percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted): Large 
increases, particularly in current spending, resulted in an ill
-
timed loosening of fiscal 
stance in boom 
years. 
F
iscal consolidation was aimed at reversing these earlier spending
.
 
Cuts in spending in Estonia 
were possible due to low
er
 
rigidities as compared to other Baltic countries
.
 
 

 
Transfer cuts 
(1
 
percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjust
ed):
 
Cuts in social transfers 
reflect lower 
replacement rates for unemployment benefits.
 
 

 
Revenue collection
 
increases 
(1Â½ 
percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted
): mostly base
-
broadening measures.
 
T
ax collection
 
held up very well, as a result of improvements in tax administration 
at
 
the onset of the crisis. Estonia has a revenue
-
productive and cost
-
effective tax system, characterized 
by an internationally acclaimed low compliance burden (with some 90 percent of t
axpayers filing 
electronically). 
As a res
ult, 
they achieved a sizeable increased in revenue collection 
despite only 
marginal increases to VAT rates (2 percent) and excise taxes.
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina
 
 
Financing constraints triggered fiscal consolidation i
n 2010
-
2011. A temporary financing rule restrained 
spending on capital goods to offset overruns in wage and other current spending. Since 2012, adjustment 
efforts have increasingly focused on rationalizing public expenditures and on improving the compositi
on of 
spending. There have also been structural fiscal reforms, including strengthening tax administration and tax 
compliance, reforms of the system of rights
-
based benefits; a comprehensive overhaul of the health sector and 
pension systems; strengthening 
the medium term budget framework; and streamlining public administration.
 
 
Main measures:
 
 

 
Transfer

(2

T
he largest contribution came from 
reduction in war
-
related benefits. As a result of a new privileg
ed pension law in the Federation, benefits 
of existing war veterans were reduced substantially
.

Capital spending cuts 
(
1Â½ 
percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted):
 
In addition, a temporary 
financing rule restrained non
-
priority spending on capital go
ods, in part explained by delays in official 
foreign financing.
 
 

 
Tax revenue increases 
(4 percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted):
 
Mostly
 
due to
 
better tax 
administration and base
-
broadening measures.
 
Large gains in revenue collection have been 
explained 
by a significant effort to strengthen tax administration. Tax compliance measures including among 
others, a broader exchange of information between collection agencies in the Federation, and 
compulsory registration of farmers to broaden the tax b
ase for social security contributions have 
resulted in increased collection of all main taxes without
 
major changes to tax rates.
 
Czech Republic
 
 
The Czech Republic reacted to the global financial crisis at first with a fiscal stimulus: in 2007
-
09, the 
structural fiscal balance widened by more than 3 percent of GDP, while public debt increased to 38 percent of 
GDP by 2010. As the crisis intensified, stimulus was withdrawn and followed by large structural consolidation 
of more than 4 percent of GDP in 201

, fiscal adjustment
 
was carried out in the context of an IMF

supported program. Consolidation 
focused on expenditures, seeking to reduce the size of the large public sector. Many expenditure measures were 
of 
a 
structural
 
nature, such as the elimination of 13th
-
month pensions and wages. From late 2010, the 
government took increasingly recourse to revenue measures, such as VAT and excise increases, while seeking 
to 
reduce public consumption and capital transfers
. Sector
-
specific taxes were levied on banks as well as retail, 
telecom, and energy firms. During the early phase of consolidation, several structural fiscal measures were 
implemented, such as the passage of a fiscal responsibility law and parametric pensi
on reforms. However, 
many of these were reversed later.

.
 

 
Revenue: 
Mostly tax rate changes and new fees and sector specific taxes.
 
Fiscal stimulus 
in 2010/11 
through reforming the personal income tax to a
 
flat
-
tax system at 16 percent (lower rate)
. 
This came at 
a significant revenue loss of about 2Â½ percent of GDP. To compensate 
for 
the loss, the government 
starting in 2010 introduced sector
-
specific taxes on banks as well as retail, telecom, and energy fi
rms. In 
addition, an increase in the VAT rate

to
 
become the highe
st
 
in Europe at 27 percent

was
 
introduced, 
followed by increases in excise taxes. These last measures resulted in increased revenue collection by 
about 3 percent of GDP.
 
Lithuania
 
 
Fiscal adjustment began in 2009 and relied mainly on expenditure measures. Spending cuts were roughly 
proportional to the size of spending categories in total expenditures. However, capital spending supported by 
EU funds was left untouched 
so as not 
to for
go external grants
 
and the attendant growth benefits
. On the 
revenue side, measures focused on indirect taxes and one
-
off measures. Public spending as a share of GDP is 
now among the smallest in the EU. Lithuania also has relatively low implicit and statut
ory tax rates.
 
 

 
Current spending cuts
 
(5Â½ 
percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted
). Evenly distributed among the 
public sector wage bill, consumption of goods and services, and transfers.
 

 
Capital spending increased
 
(0.7 percent of potential GDP, cycl
ically adjusted). Capital spending 
supported by 
EU funds
 
was left untouched lest to forgo external grants. 
 

 
Revenue collection: 
A
 
base broadening of social security contribution (by including self
 
employed
 
professions that previously did not pay social con
tributions)
 
with a positive revenue impact of about 
 
1Â½ percent of potential GDP. 
 
A
 
reduction of
 
the personal income tax
 
rate, which explains deterioration 
in revenue collection by about 2 percent of potential GDP.
 
Latvia
 
 
Fiscal tightening was 
at first 
mostly carried out through expenditure cuts in the context of an IMF supported 
program. Measures included a 4 percent of GDP cut in remuneration

by means of a sizeable wage
 
cut
s for 
central government employees

and cuts in public investment. 
The focus shif

-
side 
measures
 
Pension cuts were reversed by the Constitutional Court. Structural reforms such as a Fiscal Discipline 
Law (FDL) and a Medium
-
Term Budget Framework were implemented in 2013.
 
 

 
Wage bill cut
 
(
3Â½ 
percent of potential 
GDP, cyclically adjusted):
 
through wage cuts for central 
government employees.
 

 
Capital spending 
(1Â½ percent of potential GDP, cyclically adjusted)
 

 
Revenue inc
reases: 
Mostly tax rate changes that included a 3 percentage point increase in personal 
income tax rate (PIT) to 26 percent, a decrease in the tax
-
free PIT 
allowance 
e, 
which resulted in a 
revenue gain by about 1Â½ percent of 
potential 
GDP
. A
 
VAT increase from 18 t
o 21 percent
 
result
ed
 
in a 
revenue gain of about 1 percent of 
potential 
GDP.
