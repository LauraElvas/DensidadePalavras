 MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS SUMMARYThe recent decline in oil prices is supporting the global economic recovery. Nevertheless, 
the recovery remains gradual and economic developments vary across regions. Growth in the 
United States remains robust, momentum is slowing in China, and activity in Japan has not regained 

traction. Economic conditions in Russia have deteriorated further, but spillovers to other emerging 

markets remain limited to date. Global trade is showing signs of strengthening. The decline in 

energy prices has lowered inflation rates globally. In euro area financial markets, short-term money market rates have declined further in an 
environment of increased excess liquidity, temporarily reaching new historic lows. Long-term 

interest rates also reached new historic lows, reflecting weak growth momentum and subdued 

inflation dynamics, as well as market expectations of sovereign debt purchases by the Eurosystem. 

At the same time euro area stock prices have increased. The exchange rate of the euro has 
depreciated further, both in nominal effective terms and against the US dollar. Overall, the latest economic indicators and survey results remain consistent with a moderate economic 
expansion in the euro area in the short term, while the recent fall in oil prices should support growth in 

the longer term. Meanwhile, although labour markets have shown some further signs of improvement, 

unemployment remains high and unutilised capacity is expected to diminish only gradually. 
Euro area HICP inflation declined significantly in December, to -0.2%. On the basis of current 
information, the short-term inflation outlook remains weak and annual HICP inflation is likely to 

stay very low or negative in the coming months. Supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures, 

the ongoing recovery and the assumption embedded in futures markets of a gradual increase in oil 
prices in the period ahead, inflation rates are expected to increase gradually later in 2015 and in 2016. 
The monetary analysis indicates that the annual growth of M3 recovered further in November. 
 The decline in loans to non-financial corporations has continued to moderate, while the growth 
of loans to households has stabilised at a slightly positive level. These developments have been 

facilitated by a broad-based and substantial reduction in lending rates recorded since summer 2014. 
 Despite the improvement in lending conditions, as reported in the January 2015 euro area bank 

lending survey, credit standards still remain relatively tight. The ECB™s monetary policy measures 

should support a further improvement in credit flows. At its meeting on 22 January 2015, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, 
the Governing Council of the ECB conducted a thorough reassessment of the outlook for price 
developments and of the monetary stimulus achieved so far. As a result, the Governing Council 

decided: first, to launch an expanded asset purchase programme, encompassing the existing 
purchase programmes for asset-backed securities and covered bonds as well as purchases of  euro-denominated investment-grade securities issued by euro area governments and agencies 

and European institutions in the secondary market (for futher details, see Box 1); second, to change the pricing of the six remaining targeted longer-term refinancing operations 

(TLTROs) by removing the 10 basis point spread over the rate on the Eurosystem™s main 
refinancing operations that applied to the first two TLTROs;third, in line with its forward guidance, to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged.6ECBEconomic Bulletin

XTERNAL ENVIRONMENT 
The recent decline in oil prices is supporting the global economic recovery.
 In response to 
a well-supplied oil market, Brent crude oil prices continued to decline sharply in December and January (see Chart 1) and stood on 21 January 2015 about 31% below the levels of early December 

(in US dollar terms). According to the futures curve, markets have priced in only a gradual increase 

in oil prices for the coming years. As lower oil prices lead to a redistribution of income from net oil 

producers to net oil consumers, this supports global demand, as net oil-consuming countries tend to 

have a higher propensity to spend.Despite the support from lower oil prices, the global economic recovery remains gradual, 
and surveys point to some softening in the growth momentum in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) excluding the euro area fell slightly in 

December to a level below both its long-term average and its third-quarter reading (see Chart 2). Global trade continues to show signs of strengthening. The volume of world merchandise imports 
excluding the euro area increased by 3.4% on a three-month-on-three-month basis in October, 

moving further above its long-term average. However, the global PMI for new manufacturing 

export orders moderated in the final quarter of 2014.Falling energy prices are leading to a decline in global inflation. 
As a result, annual consumer 
price inflation in the OECD area decreased further to 1.5% in November. The fall in inflation was 
broad-based across major economies, except for Russia, which experienced a significant increase. 

Annual OECD inflation excluding food and energy fell further to 1.7% in November. Given the Chart 1 Brent crude oil prices and futures(USD or EUR per barrel)02040

global inflation will continue.US activity was stronger than expected, and indicators point to robust growth in the short term. 
According to the third estimate, real GDP growth increased by 1.2% quarter on quarter in the third 

quarter of 2014, which is the strongest growth rate in almost a decade. Recent data remained robust, 
suggesting only a slight moderation in growth in the final quarter of the year. On balance, the 

income windfall for consumers from lower oil prices is expected to more than offset the negative 

impact from the further strengthening of the US dollar since December, thus providing a boost to the 
 overall outlook for the United States. At the same time falling oil prices are expected to lead to 

lower CPI inflation in the short term, reinforced by downward pressures from the appreciation 
 of the US dollar. This was already reflected in a drop in annual CPI inflation to 0.8% in December 

from the rate of 1.7% that had prevailed since August. As Japan™s economy failed to re-gain sustained traction after the hike in VAT in April, the government announced further fiscal stimulus measures. The second data release confirmed 
the decline in Japanese real GDP by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2014. 
 High-frequency indicators point to a return to positive, albeit weak, growth in the fourth quarter. 

At the end of 2014 the government announced a stimulus package and a reduction in the effective 

corporate tax rate in order to support growth. Meanwhile annual consumer price inflation continued 

to ease to 2.4% in November, driven largely by lower energy prices. In the United Kingdom, short-term indicators point to a slowdown in economic activity, while 
inflation has fallen to very low levels. While activity will be supported by higher real disposable 
income in view of falling energy prices, survey indicators point towards a near-term slowdown in the 
 pace of expansion. Annual CPI inflation eased further to 0.5% in December 2014 owing to lower 

energy prices. At the same time annual CPI inflation excluding food and energy remained broadly 

stable at around 1.3%.Growth momentum in China has slowed, and inflation remains low. 
Quarterly GDP growth slowed to 1.5% in the final quarter of 2014 on the back of weakness in the housing market and 
heavy industries. In a longer term perspective, Chinese growth continues on its path of gradual 

deceleration (see Box 2), although the recent drop in oil prices could provide some temporary 

support. Annual consumer price inflation Œ at 1.5% in December Œ is hovering at close to two and 

a half-year lows and is expected to decline further, reflecting both the slowdown in demand and the 

current weakness in commodity prices. While the economic situation deteriorated markedly in Russia, spillovers to other emerging 

market economies remain limited thus far.
 With the fall in oil prices accelerating in December, 

tensions in Russian financial and foreign exchange markets intensified, triggering forceful policy 

action. Following a rise of 100 basis points at its regular meeting on 11 December 2014, the Central 

Bank of Russia increased the policy rate by a further 650 basis points to 17% on 15 December 2014. 
Repercussions on other emerging market economies have been comparatively limited. However, 

there are some signs of deterioration in the financial market indicators of countries with closer 

commercial links to Russia in the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Central and Eastern 

Europe.8ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 20152 FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS1Short-term money market rates declined further in an environment of increased excess liquidity, briefly registering a new historic low. 
This followed the settlement of the 

December 2014 targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO), the second in the series, 
which amounted to •129.8
 billion, compared with the •82.6
 billion settled in the first TLTRO 
in September
 2014. The net liquidity injection of the second TLTRO amounted to •95
 billion, contributing to a significant increase in excess liquidity. The EONIA declined from an average level 

of around -2
 basis points in the first week of the twelfth maintenance period to an average level of 
around -5 basis points in the remaining four weeks (recording a new historic low of -8.5
 basis points on 24 December), amid higher excess liquidity. The EONIA stood at -6.8
 basis points on 21 January 2015 (see Chart 3). Long-term interest rates in the euro area also reached new historic lows against the background 
of a weak economic and inflation outlook. 
A synthetic measure of ten-year AAA-rated euro area 

government bond yields showed that they declined from
 0.84% on 4 December 2014 to a new historic low of
 0.48% on 16 January 2015 (see Chart 4). At the end of the review period they stood 
at 0.54%. The decline in long-term yields reflected market expectations of a further weakening of 
inflation dynamics in an environment of weak growth, as well as increasing market expectations 

of sovereign debt purchases by the ECB. The yield on US Treasuries with a ten-year maturity 
(see Chart
 4) recorded a decline similar to that of euro area yields, suggesting that global factors 
may have contributed to the decline in the synthetic measure of the ten-year AAA-rated euro area 

government bond yields. The spreads between sovereign bonds in Germany and other euro area  1 The period under review is from 4 December 2014 to 21 January 2015.

increase by more than 200 basis points. In the euro area, stock prices increased in the last part of the review period. The broad-based EURO 
STOXX equity price index increased by
 3.1% over the review period as a whole. The predominance 
 of dampening factors, such as weak growth momentum and the political uncertainties in Greece, 

abated in the week of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council, amid market 

expectations of sovereign debt purchases by the ECB. Stock market uncertainty in the euro area, as 

measured by implied volatility, increased and ended the review period at levels that are at the higher 

end of the range recorded over the past two years. The stock market in the United States weakened 

over the review period Œ the Standard & Poor™s 500 index declined by
 1.9% Œ and implied volatility 
increased slightly.The euro continued to depreciate amid expectations of further diverging monetary policies in the 
euro area and abroad. Overall, the euro weakened by 3.4% in trade-weighted terms over the review 
period. In the euro area, the subdued inflation outlook and declining benchmark bond yields, which 

reflected, among other things, the global increase in risk aversion, weighed on the exchange rate. 
 The euro fell by 5.8% against the US dollar, which was supported by market uncertainty in an environment 
of declining oil prices and heightened geopolitical tensions. The euro also continued to depreciate Œ albeit 

at a slower pace Œ against the pound sterling, which reached a six-year high against the single currency. 

Higher volatility and the decline in risk appetite supported the Japanese yen, leading the euro to decline 

by almost 8% against the Japanese currency. Following the announcement of the Swiss National Bank 
on 15 January 2015 that it would discontinue its minimum exchange rate target of 1.20 Swiss francs 
per euro, the euro depreciated sharply against the Swiss franc, to trade at around parity thereafter. 
 The Danish krone continued to trade close to its central rate within ERM II, while Danmarks 

Nationalbank reduced interest rates twice over the review period. In contrast, a weakening of the 

currencies of central and eastern European countries mitigated the depreciation of the euro in 

effective terms.
 On 1 January 2015 Lithuania adopted the euro and became the
 19th member of the 
 euro area (see Box 3).3 E
CONOMIC ACTIVITYFollowing six quarters of positive output growth, most recent hard data remain consistent 

with a further moderate economic expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In October 
and November industrial production excluding construction stood, on average, 0.3% above its 
 third-quarter level, when production contracted by
 0.4%. For the same period, construction production stood 0.5% above the figure for the third quarter, when it also recorded a decline. Recent developments in retail trade and car registrations are in line with continued positive private 

consumption growth in the fourth quarter, while the production of capital goods points to a modest 

expansion of euro area investment.The outlook of a gradual recovery is also confirmed by more timely survey data.
 The euro area composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) declined from the third quarter to the fourth 

quarter, mainly reflecting a weakening in sentiment for the services sector. However, the average 

for the fourth quarter remains consistent with moderate positive growth, signalling a continuation of 

the ongoing gradual recovery (see Chart 5). The economic sentiment indicator (ESI) also declined, albeit marginally, over the same period. As with the PMI, the average for the fourth quarter of the 

year is, however, still in line with an expansion of output. 10ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 2015Labour markets, while still weak, have improved somewhat further.
 Employment rose by
 0.2% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of
 2014, following an increase of
 0.3% in the previous quarter 
(see Chart
 6). The unemployment rate for the euro area, which started to decline in mid-2013,
 remained stable at
 11.5% between August and November 2014 (see also Box 4). More timely information obtained from survey results points to a modest strengthening of labour markets in the 
last quarter of 2014.Looking beyond the short term, the recent fall in oil prices should support growth, 

particularly domestic demand, through gains in the real disposable income of households 

and in firms™ profits 
(see Box 5). Domestic demand should also be supported by the Governing Council™s monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions and the 

progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Furthermore, demand for euro area 

exports should benefit from the global recovery. However, the euro area recovery is likely to 

continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity and the necessary 

balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. The results from the latest Survey 

of Professional Forecasters show that private sector GDP growth forecasts were revised down 

for 2015, by 0.1 percentage point to
 1.1%, compared with the previous survey round, while those 
for 2016 remained unchanged at
 1.5%. At the same time, unemployment expectations remained 
unchanged.Chart 5 Euro area real GDP, composite

RICES AND COSTSThe recent fall in oil prices has led to significant downward pressures on HICP inflation 
(see Box 5). The annual rate of change of the euro area HICP was -0.2% in December
 2014, the first negative rate recorded since October
 2009, and down from 0.3% recorded in November 2014 (see Chart 7). In contrast to headline inflation, HICP excluding food and energy continued on a 
broadly stable path, remaining at 0.7% from October to December.Price developments at the earlier stages of the production chain continue to signal a 

subdued outlook for inflation. The annual rate of industrial producer price inflation excluding 

construction and energy stabilised between October and November to stand at -0.2% in December. 

Producer price inflation for non-food consumer goods declined slightly in November. Only the 
annual rate of change of import prices for intermediate goods has seen the first positive recording 

since November 2012, which can be partly explained by the recent depreciation of the euro effective 
exchange rate. Pipeline pressures for HICP food have remained weak at each stage of the price 

chain. In November, the annual rate of change in producer prices for consumer food fell slightly, 
while euro area farm gate prices were also quite weak.Labour cost growth continues to be moderate. 
The annual rate of change in compensation per employee for the euro area fell slightly, making a year-on-year increase of
 1.3% in the third quarter of 2014, from 1.4% in the previous quarter (see Chart 8). Sectoral data indicate that the slower 
annual growth in compensation per employee was mainly accounted for by lower contributions 

from the industry and the construction sectors. The annual rate of change in unit labour costs for 

the euro area was marginally higher at
 1.1% in the third quarter of
 2014, as the deceleration in 
compensation per employee was more than offset by a slowdown in productivity growth.Chart 7 Contribution of components to euro

Issue 1 / 2015Similarly, profit margins remain weak.
 Profit growth (measured in terms of gross operating 
surplus) remained unchanged at
 1.0% in the third quarter of 2014 in line with the modest recovery in economic growth. The weak dynamics reflected subdued contributions from real GDP growth 

and growth in profits per unit of output (a measure for profit margins). From a sectoral perspective, 
the subdued developments in profits are shared by the industrial and the market services sectors. 

Box 6 discusses these recent profit developments in further detail.Financial market indicators of medium and long-term inflation expectations have shown 

signs of a weakening, while survey-based measures for longer-term expectations have 

remained more stable. 
Long-term forward inflation-linked swap rates and the five-year forward 

five-year ahead, bond-based break-even inflation rate declined substantially in December and 

early January 2015, following the sharp decline in oil prices. These measures currently stand at 
around 1.5-1.6%, possibly reflecting, to some extent, negative inflation risk premia. By contrast, 
survey-based measures for longer-term inflation expectations remain broadly unchanged. 

According to the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), for the first quarter of 2015, the average inflation expectations for
 2019 were around 1.8% (see survey at: www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/indic/forecast/shared/files/reports/spfreport201501.en.pdf). Shorter-term survey-based and 

market-based inflation expectations, as measured by inflation swap rates, have continued to decline 

and point to a very subdued outlook for inflation over the next two years.On the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for oil, annual HICP 
inflation is expected to remain very low or negative in the months ahead.
 Supported by the 

ECB™s monetary policy measures, the expected recovery in demand and the assumption of a gradual 

increase in oil prices in the period ahead, inflation rates are expected to increase gradually later 

in 2015 and in
 2016. The results from the latest SPF imply average inflation expectations of
 0.3%, 1.1% and 1.5% for 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively. The downward revisions of
 0.7 percentage point for 2015 and 0.3 percentage point for 2016 mainly reflect lower oil prices.5 M
ONEY AND CREDITMoney dynamics remain on a path of recovery. 
The annual growth rate of M3 picked up to 
3.1% in November, after 2.5% in October and the trough of 0.8% in April (see Chart 9). The rate 
 of increase over the past three months was 5% in annualised terms. The recovery of M3 growth was 

broad-based across countries and sectors, and reflected high inflows into overnight deposits held 
 by both households and non-financial corporations (NFCs). In an environment of very low interest rates, investors continue to search for yield.
 The low 
remuneration of monetary assets encourages money holders to prefer overnight deposits to other 

deposits or marketable instruments within M3, even though there are signs that the contraction of 

marketable instruments is phasing out. While some investors have moved from less liquid deposits 

included in M3 towards riskier assets outside M3, other investors have shifted away from longer-term 
 financial liabilities, thereby supporting M3 growth. The annual rate of change in longer-term MFI 

financial liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) held by the money-holding sector declined 

further in November. In addition, international investors again showed a keen interest in euro area 

securities. In the 12 months to the end of November 2014, MFIs™ net external assets increased by 

•315 billion. This figure largely reflects the net purchases by foreigners of securities issued by euro 

area residents and current account surpluses.13ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015Loans to the private sector continue to recover gradually. The annual rate of change in 
MFI loans to the private sector was -0.2% in November, after -0.5% in October (see Chart 9). 
 The gradual improvement in credit dynamics was visible across households and firms. The 
annual rate of change in MFI loans to NFCs (adjusted for sales and securitisation) was
 -1.3% in November, compared with -1.6% in October and the trough of -3.2% in February. 
 The annual growth of loans to households increased marginally to 0.7% in November, thus 

remaining slightly above the average observed since early 2013. Despite these positive trends, the 

consolidation of bank balance sheets and further deleveraging needs in some economic sectors and 

banking jurisdictions still curb credit dynamics.The reductions in bank lending rates have been sizeable since summer 2014. The overall nominal 
cost of external financing for euro area NFCs declined in the fourth quarter of 2014, after having 

stabilised in the autumn of 2014. The cost of market-based debt has continued to fall in January 
2015, while the cost of equity has stabilised. The declines were due to the ECB™s accommodative 

monetary policy stance, the decrease in banks™ composite funding costs, which have stabilised close 

to historically low levels, and increased competition among banks for loans. Rates on loans to NFCs 

declined further in November, in particular in the case of long-term loans (the cost-of-borrowing 

indicator for euro area NFCs fell to 2.5% in November, compared with 2.8% in June). Rates on 

loans to households for house purchase also fell in November, (the cost-of-borrowing indicator 

for households for house purchase decreased to 2.6%). At the same time, the cost of deposit 

funding for euro area banks remained broadly stable, while yields on bank bonds declined slightly. 
 MFI issuance of debt securities remained negative, and the ongoing contraction of balance 
 sheets and the strengthening of the banks™ capital base is reducing the need for banks to seek 

funding via debt securities issuance.Chart 9 M3 and loans to the private sector(annual rate of growth and annualised three-month growth rate)-4-20

Issue 1 / 2015The January 2015 euro area bank lending survey points to improvements in lending 
conditions; however, credit standards remain tight from a historical perspective 
 (see survey at: www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/pdf/blssurvey_201501.pdf).
 Banks continued to ease credit standards for loans to both NFCs and households (in
 net terms) in the fourth quarter of 
2014 (see Chart 10). These positive developments were driven by improved cost of funds and 
balance sheet conditions, as well as by stronger competitive pressures. In addition, the impact 

of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) on the loan supply is expected to 

largely translate into a narrowing of lending margins. The survey points to a pick-up in demand 

for loans to NFCs and consumer credit, and a continued increase in the demand for housing loans 
 (see Chart 10). Firms™ loan demand was largely driven by financing needs for fixed investment. However, the overall growth in external financing of non-financial corporations in the euro 
area, viewed on an annual basis, remains relatively weak.
 According to the most recent euro 

area accounts, debt securities issuance by euro area NFCs moderated in the third quarter of 2014 

but remained sufficient, together with robust equity issuance, to more than offset the declining net 

redemptions of bank loans. Securities issuance data for October and November suggest that the 

flows remain positive and support a gradual increase in the external financing of euro area NFCs. 
15ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015BOXESBox 1THE GOVERNING COUNCIL™S EXPANDED ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAMMEAt its meeting on 22 January 2015 the Governing Council of the ECB decided to launch an 
expanded asset purchase programme (APP)
, encompassing the existing purchase programmes 
for asset-backed securities and covered bonds, as well as purchases of euro-denominated 

investment-grade securities issued by euro area governments, agencies and European institutions 

in the secondary market. Under this expanded programme, the combined monthly purchases of 

public and private sector securities will amount to •60 billion. The intention is for these purchases 

to be carried out until the end of September 2016, and they will, in any case, be conducted until 
the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent 

with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This box 

explains the rationale for the Governing Council™s decision to expand its existing asset purchase 

programme and indicates the main transmission channels and key modalities of the APP.Rationale for expanding the ECB™s asset purchase programme
With regard to the outlook for price developments, the December 2014 Eurosystem staff projections pointed to a relatively low path for inflation until 2016 in an environment of 

gradual recovery. More recently, the fall in oil prices further weakened the short-term inflation 
outlook. In this environment, the likelihood had increased that inflation would remain too low 

for a prolonged period, implying risks to medium-term price stability. While the sharp fall in oil 

prices over recent months remains the dominant factor driving current inflation developments, 
measures of HICP excluding energy and food prices have also been falling since 2013 and 

remained relatively low in 2014 (see Chart A). Moreover, from the summer of 2014 the weaker 

inflation dynamics started to influence market-based measures of inflation expectations across

Issue 1 / 2015a range of maturities, including at horizons at which they should normally show resilience to 
realised inflation observations. In January 2015 market-based inflation expectations suggested 

that inflation would only return to more normal levels at very extended horizons. Overall, the 

risk had intensified that the sequence of negative surprises to headline inflation figures would be 

propagated to price formation in the future. Regarding the assessment of the monetary stimulus achieved via the monetary policy initiatives 
adopted between June and September 2014,
 the Governing Council considered two dimensions: 
the pass-through potential of each unit of euro liquidity introduced and the quantity of liquidity 

likely to be generated.The strength of the pass-through from a given amount of liquidity injected into private 
sector borrowing costs has been satisfactory. This can be seen, for instance, in the downward 

trend of bank lending rates to non-financial corporations that started in the third quarter 
 of 2014, coinciding with the first targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) and the 

announcement of the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP) and covered bond 

purchase programme (CBPP-3; see Chart B). In addition, on average, over recent months net 
redemptions of loans to non-financial corporations have moderated from the historically high 

levels recorded a year ago, and net lending flows turned slightly positive in November 2014. 

In addition, the January 2015 Bank Lending Survey indicated a further net easing of credit 

standards across all loan categories in the fourth quarter of 2014.However, the monetary policy measures did 
not result in a sufficient quantity of liquidity 

being generated. In this regard, recent measures 

have fallen short of the expectations regarding 

the expansion of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet 

that had been entertained when the measures 

were calibrated with a view to fostering a more 

rapid return of inflation to levels below, but 

close to, 2%. This has weakened the overall 

transmission of the measures to the broader 

financing conditions in the economy, thereby 

significantly reducing the upside support that 

the summer 2014 measures were expected to 

provide to inflation in the medium term.A forceful monetary policy response therefore became warranted
. Given the 
weakened medium-term outlook on price 

stability and the quantitative shortfall of 

existing monetary policy measures, the 

Governing Council judged the prevailing 

degree of monetary accommodation as 

insufficient to adequately address the 

heightened risks of too prolonged a period of 

low inflation and to ensure that the ECB fulfils 

its objective of price stability. Chart B Composite indicator of the

November 2014 preliminary data.17ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015Transmission and key modalities of the ECB™s expanded asset purchase programmeWith key interest rates at their lower bound, the Governing Council considered outright 
purchases of securities with a high potential for influencing the financing conditions faced 

by euro area households and firms to be warranted in view of the ECB™s price stability 

mandate. At the lower bound for policy interest rates, the adoption of further quantitative 

measures that can expand the size and change the composition of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet 

constitutes the only effective tool to provide further monetary policy accommodation. In this 

regard, balance sheet measures in the form of outright asset purchases allow full control to be 
taken of the degree of monetary stimulus. At the same time, further outright purchases should be 

composed of assets that both feature a high transmission potential to the real economy and are 

available in sufficient volumes. Purchases of investment grade bonds of euro area sovereigns are 

an effective instrument in this respect for at least two reasons. First, the sovereign yield curve 

constitutes the bedrock benchmark indicator for pricing a vast array of credit instruments and 

forms of external finance for the private economy, for example bank loans, corporate loans and 

equity. Conducting such purchases in proportions across sovereign issuers that indirectly reflect 

the economic weight of the various Member States in the euro area economy broadens the scope 

of interventions and thus amplifies their monetary impact. Second, the market for such securities 

is sufficiently deep and liquid to minimise the potential distortive effects of central bank action 

on the formation of market prices.The APP will work through the same channels that have been shown to be associated 
with quantitative policies in other jurisdictions, although the relative importance of 

these channels may differ
. The ECB™s interventions underscore the Governing Council™s 

determination to use all available tools within its mandate to address the risks of too prolonged a 

period of low inflation. In this way, the announcement of a significant expansion in the size and 

composition of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet through the APP will strengthen confidence and 

support inflation expectations, having a direct impact on real interest rates and thus counteracting 

an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions. Furthermore, the ECB™s interventions will 

reduce yields on government bonds, which will set in motion a more conventional chain of 

propagation channels that will support the economic recovery and help bring inflation back 

to levels below, but close to, 2%. These avenues work through price effects Œ as mentioned 

above, the pricing of a large variety of assets and loan contracts in the economy are a function 

of sovereign yields Œ and through quantity effects, as the additional liquidity introduced through 

the purchases is used by private investors to re-allocate their portfolios into a multitude of other 

assets that are not addressed by the central bank interventions, thereby leading to an easing of 

conditions across broad sources of private-sector financing.The Governing Council decided on the purchase modalities for the APP. Purchases will be conducted at a monthly pace of •60 billion and are intended to be carried out until the end 

of September 2016 and, in any case, until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment 

in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 

2% over the medium term. The monthly purchases will comprise purchases of asset-backed 
securities and covered bonds under the ABSPP and CBPP-3, as well as additional purchases of 

securities issued by euro area governments, agencies and EU institutions. With regard to these 

additional asset purchases, the Governing Council retains control over all the design features 

of the programme, including the purchase allocation, asset eligibility, and the pace and size 

of the purchases, thereby safeguarding the singleness of the Eurosystem™s monetary policy. 
18ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 2015While the ECB will coordinate the purchases, the Eurosystem will make use of decentralised implementation to mobilise its resources.With regard to the sharing of hypothetical losses, the Governing Council decided that 20% of the additional asset purchases will be subject to loss sharing.
 The Governing Council 

decided that purchases of securities of European institutions (which will constitute 12% of 

the additional asset purchases and will be purchased by NCBs) will be subject to loss sharing. 

The rest of the NCBs™ additional asset purchases will not be subject to loss sharing. The ECB 

will hold 8% of the additional asset purchases. This implies that 20% of the additional asset 

purchases will be subject to a regime of risk sharing. The arrangement underlines the choice of 

the monetary policy instrument that is most appropriate to achieve price stability, while taking 

into account the unique institutional structure of the euro area, where a common currency and 

single monetary policy coexists with 19 national fiscal policies. In particular, the chosen regime 

ensures the effectiveness of sovereign bond purchases by mitigating concerns relating to moral 

hazard, thereby preserving incentives for prudent fiscal policies and the necessary structural 

reforms.With regard to asset eligibility, the Governing Council announced the following criteria.
 The Governing Council decided to buy securities that fulfil the collateral eligibility criteria for 
marketable assets in order to participate in Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Securities 

that do not achieve the specified criteria will be eligible, as long as the Eurosystem™s minimum 

credit quality threshold is not applied for the purpose of their collateral eligibility. Moreover, in 

the case of euro area Member States under financial assistance programmes, eligibility will be 

suspended during reviews and will resume only in the event of a positive outcome.The sizeable increase in the Eurosystem™s balance sheet will further ease the monetary 
policy stance, and the APP will decisively underpin the firm anchoring of medium to 
 long-term inflation expectations
. Moreover, these decisions by the Governing Council will 
support its forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and reinforce the fact that there 

are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycles of major advanced 

economies. Taken together, these factors should strengthen demand, increase capacity utilisation, 

and support money and credit growth, thereby contributing to a sustained return of inflation 

towards a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.19ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015Box 2 
THE OUTLOOK FOR CHINA™S ECONOMY: RISKS, REFORMS AND CHALLENGES 
China™s economic growth has slowed further in 2014, continuing the moderation seen since the stimulus package implemented in the wake of the financial crisis. Cyclical factors have 

played a role, including the softening in global demand and monetary tightening to keep credit 

growth in check. But much of the slowdown has been structural as the traditional drivers of 

buoyant Chinese growth Œ favourable demographics, manufacturing exports and the country™s 

accession to the World Trade Organization Œ are running out of steam. Although economic activity has weakened, internal imbalances continue to increase Œ 
particularly the reliance on credit-driven investment to fuel growth.
 China™s investment 
reached 46% of GDP in 2013 (Chart A). Judging by current trends (i.e. for the period until the 

third quarter of
 2014), it
 is likely that this ratio will only decline very marginally in 2014, largely 
shrugging off the drop in property investment resulting from a weak housing market. Meanwhile, 

leveraging activity has continued to rise: since the end of 2007, China™s private sector credit-to-

GDP ratio has increased by over 80 percentage points and credit growth remains well in excess 

of nominal GDP growth, despite having moderated somewhat since early 2013 (Chart B).Imbalances have given rise to a number of policy challenges. Corporate and local government 
debt has expanded significantly, helped by the rapid growth of shadow banking. In addition, 

there has been growing concern among analysts and policy-makers about overinvestment and the 

misallocation of capital across a number of industries Œ in particular property and related heavy 

industries. The housing market slowed sharply in 2014, leading to higher inventories and lower 

house prices. Anecdotal evidence suggests that property developers, especially smaller firms, 

are under pressure to consolidate or scale back activities. Prices of construction-related goods

Issue 1 / 2015(such as steel) have also fallen and PPI inflation in China has been negative since early 2012, 
putting pressure on profit margins in a range of heavy industries. Furthermore, fast credit expansion 

has led to rising non-performing loan ratios, but these are still at a low level. A number of defaults 

or near-defaults on bonds and other financial products, something previously unheard of in China, 

also point to growing tensions in the financial sector. Moreover, high and rising debt levels seem to 

be constraining local governments™ ability to continue investing in infrastructure at the same high 

pace as a few years ago. It should be noted that the recent fall in oil prices is generally a positive 

development for China, given that it is a major net importer of oil. But this will only be significant 

if oil prices stay low for an extended period of time. Overall, although it is likely that China™s 

growth will continue to decelerate gradually in the foreseeable future, in line with its declining 

potential, the downside risks to the economic outlook seem to have increased. 
Structural reforms are needed to address vulnerabilities.
 A comprehensive reform agenda 
was announced at the end of 2013, based on a diagnosis of the structural economic challenges 
facing China. The broad principles underlying the agenda emphasise the need for markets to 

play a decisive role in allocating resources to all enterprises, regardless of whether they are in 

private or public ownership, with enterprises being able to compete under equal conditions. 

They also aim to limit the scope of government action to effective regulation and preserving 

macroeconomic stability, rather than micromanaging decisions by economic actors. The specific 

proposals are wide-ranging, including price and financial sector liberalisation, the opening 

up of markets to private firms and foreign competition, reform of state-owned enterprises 

(SOEs), fiscal reform, as well as land and household registration reform. If implemented in full, 

they should help reduce the medium-term risks of an abrupt slowdown in growth.Some promising steps have been taken to date, but progress has been uneven. Substantial 
headway has been made in respect of financial sector reform, promoting cross-border capital 

flows, social security and fiscal reform, while measures to liberalise the economy and reform 
SOEs seem to have been more limited so far. The State Council has proposed a deposit guarantee 

system and approved plans to make local government debt more transparent and sustainable. 
Further action has been taken towards realising capital account liberalisation (the Shanghai-

Hong Kong Stock Connect pilot programme being a case in point). The daily trading range of 

the exchange rate was increased to 2% and interest rates are gradually being liberalised. Labour 

mobility has also been promoted through a reform of China™s hukou (household registration) 

system. In other areas, progress has been rather patchy. Some local governments have announced 

timetables for reforming SOE governance and reducing government holdings, but without 

clearly redefining the role of SOEs. In addition, measures to liberalise the economy appear quite 

modest, focusing on streamlining administrative approval processes and opening up a number of 

infrastructure projects and industries to private capital and foreign investment. While important challenges remain, the Chinese authorities continue to be committed to 
the reform process. They have set 2020 as the deadline for implementing the bulk of reforms 

and they have recently reaffirmed their commitment to achieving that goal. As regards the 

financial sector, complementing the proposed deposit guarantee system with a clearer framework 

for the resolution of non-viable financial institutions will help further reduce moral hazard while 

allowing for more progress in interest rate liberalisation. Furthermore, dismantling administrative 

hurdles and investment restrictions in industries such as banking, telecommunications and 

energy would stimulate effective competition, enable new firms to enter the market and boost 

innovation and productivity, ultimately putting growth on a more sustainable footing.21ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015Box˜3LITHUANIA ADOPTS THE EUROOn 1 January 2015 Lithuania adopted the euro and became the 19th member of the euro area. The

Issue 1 / 2015The macroeconomic imbalances that built up in the years preceding the
 2007-08 crisis have 
been corrected thanks to measures put in place by the Lithuanian government, without any 
external support. Prior to 2007 credit growth and capital inflows fuelled growth in domestic 
demand in Lithuania, which experienced one of the EU™s fastest growth rates. At the same time 
macroeconomic imbalances built up as the country experienced sizeable capital inflows, mainly 

to the non-tradable sector. The government started to implement adjustment measures in
 2008 by cutting nominal wages in the public and private sectors in order to restore competitiveness. 
 A credible and frontloaded consolidation strategy together with structural reforms also helped 

Lithuania™s adjustment. The budget deficit was reduced from
 9.4% in 2009 to 2.6% in 2013. Liquidity was provided to the banking system, combined with measures to raise capital buffers 

and reforms to strengthen banking supervision. The economy started to recover in
 2010, led by a strengthening in exports on account of strong foreign demand and gains in competitiveness, 

followed by a rebound in domestic demand. Although the ratio of public debt to GDP more than 

doubled during the economic crisis, it stood at
 39% in 2013, which is significantly below the 
euro area average of 93% in the same year.More recently, economic activity has remained dynamic, with real GDP growing 

by 2.6% year on year in the third quarter of 2014 and positive developments in the labour 
market. The unemployment rate stood at
 9.3%, compared with its peak of 18.2% in the second quarter of
 2010. However, there has been a decline in the labour force owing to the number of 
people emigrating in search of work in other EU countries. This fact combined with the skill 

mismatching that characterises the Lithuanian labour market may lead to skill shortages and 

wage increases, undermining Lithuania™s ability to continue to gain market shares in global trade.
Lithuania™s production structure is broadly similar to that of the euro area as a whole.
 In the Lithuanian economy, industry (including construction) contributes around
 31% to total value added. The share of services is slightly lower, at around 66%, while the contribution of 
the agricultural sector, at
 4%, is somewhat above that of the euro area as a whole. Furthermore, Lithuania is a very open economy and its key trading partner is the rest of the euro area, 

which accounts for around 38% of its total exports and
 40% of its total imports. Other important 
trading partners include Poland and Russia.The country™s financial sector is bank-dominated. Bank credit to the private sector amounted 
to 46% of GDP in 2013. The banking system is highly concentrated and dominated by Nordic 
banks, and became
 90% foreign-owned after the failure of the two largest domestic banks. 
Meanwhile, the country™s non-banking financial sector is very small and undeveloped Œ its stock 

market capitalisation, at just below
 10% of GDP in
 2013, is among the lowest of the euro area countries. Capital markets are small and mainly consist of government bond markets.In order to fully reap the benefits of the euro and to allow adjustment mechanisms to operate 
efficiently within the enlarged currency area, Lithuania needs to continue its reform efforts 

after the euro has been adopted.
1 Economic policies should be geared towards maintaining 
price stability, ensuring the sustainability of the convergence process and sustainable growth in 

the long term. The Lithuanian authorities have committed to fully aligning their fiscal framework 

with the euro area fiscal requirements, strengthening it through the Fiscal Compact and increasing 

the flexibility of the economy in the face of adverse shocks. Lietuvos bankas is assuming

 further strengthen cooperation under the European banking union and maintain financial stability. 
 Lithuania needs to remain vigilent by implementing macro-prudential policies that avoid the 
emergence of any renewed financial imbalances arising after euro adoption. Despite the progress 

made so far in terms of structural reforms, the authorities are committed to do more in terms 

of further improving the business environment, investing in infrastructure needs and improving 

the quality of state-owned enterprises with a view to maintaining the competitiveness of the 

economy. Skill mismatches in the labour market need to be addressed in order to tackle the 

high structural unemployment by reforming the educational system and reducing the labour 

tax wedge. These reforms would lead to an improved labour market and contribute to potential 

growth. In the environment of the stability-oriented monetary policy conducted by the ECB, it is 

essential that Lithuania ensures an economic environment that is conducive to sustainable output 

and job creation in the medium to long term.24ECBEconomic Bulletin

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE IN THE EURO AREADespite the severe recessionary periods that have affected the euro area in recent years, the 
labour force participation rate in the euro area has shown (atypically) positive developments. 
 Defined as the share of the working age population that is either employed or currently 
seeking work, the participation rate
1 was on a rising trend in the euro area from
 2000 to 2012.  It then stabilised at around 64% in 2014. This box reviews recent developments in participation 
rates in the euro area as a whole and in the four largest euro area countries, and discusses the 
impact of demographic trends in comparison with other cyclical and structural factors.2 The rise in the aggregate participation rate has been driven mainly by the increase in the 

participation rates of older age groups (55-74), while the participation rate of younger age 

groups (15-24) has been falling 
(see Chart A). At the same time, the evolution of the population 
distribution was putting downward pressure on the participation rate. This is explained 
 by the fact that the shares of the population subgroups with the lowest participation rates (those 

between 55 and 74 years old) have increased, whereas the shares of those with the highest 
participation rates (mainly the prime-age population) have decreased (see Chart B).1 This box focuses on the population aged between 15 and 74. 2 For a further discussion of factors affecting the labour force participation rate, see the box entitled ﬁRecent developments in labour 
market participation in the euro areaﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, November 2013.Chart A Developments in participation rates

largest euro area countries
 since the start of the crisis. The participation rate has risen 

sharply in Germany and shown a slight 

increase in France (see Chart C). In Spain, the 

participation rate continued to rise despite the 

heavy impact of the crisis on its labour market,
3 before starting to fall at the beginning of 2013. In Italy, after declining, the participation rate 

started to increase again in 2012.The rise in the German participation rate was 
driven mostly by changes in participation 

behaviour across age groups, particularly 

in older age groups, which might be due to 

the implementation of the Hartz reforms 

and the phasing-out of early retirement 
options between 2006 and 2010. From 2009 

participation rates also benefited from an 

increase in net immigration to Germany. 

In France, the small rise in the participation rate was mainly attributable to an increase in the 

participation rate of older age groups (driven by an increase in the retirement age). In Spain, 

the rise in the participation rate up to 2012 mainly reflected positive changes in participation 

decisions (primarily among those aged between 40 and 64), which broadly offset the negative 

impact of changes in the population composition. The sharp rise in the Spanish participation 

rate also benefited from the resilience of the upward trend in female participation (which started 

in the 1980s). The fall in the participation rate since 2013 to some extent reflects the outward 

migration of foreigners and could also be explained by the fall in the participation rate of both the 

youth cohorts and older (those aged between 65 and 74) cohorts. In Italy, the negative impact of 
changes in the population composition was broadly offset by changes in participation decisions. 

The sharp decline in the participation rate that started after 2008 was related to the increase in 

discouraged workers. From 2012 the participation rate started to rise again, partly driven by the 

pension reform, which foresaw a gradual increase in the retirement age and restrictions on early 

retirement.Concluding remarks
Looking ahead, the population distribution in the euro area is changing, with the share of older age groups (where participation rates are lower), in particular, increasing over time. Although higher 

participation rates can be expected from these older age groups (as a result of improvements 
 in health and life expectancy, benefit reforms and retirement ages), further increases in the 

participation rate of all age groups will be needed if the aggregate participation rate is to continue 

to follow a rising trend. 3 The participation rate in Spain appears to be very resilient, whereas the unemployment rate tripled between 2008 and 2013. Chart C Participation rates in the euro area

Issue 1 / 2015Box˜5THE RECENT OIL PRICE DECLINE AND THE EURO AREA ECONOMIC OUTLOOKThe recent large decline in oil prices seems to be mainly driven by supply-related factors.
 Global oil supply has been supported by growth in US shale oil production and steady production 

from Russia, Iraq and Libya, while OPEC decided in November not to lower its production 

target (see Chart A). In addition, global demand for oil has been softening and oil demand 

forecasts for
 2014 and 2015 have been repeatedly revised downwards.
1 However, the role of 
demand factors in the decline of oil prices appears to have been limited. This is underlined by 

developments in prices of other commodities, which typically correlate strongly with economic 

activity and demand, and which have declined to a much lesser extent compared with oil prices 

(see Chart B). This suggests that oil-specific supply shocks played a dominant role. The recent fall in oil prices should therefore be expected to support global economic 
activity. Lower oil prices imply a transfer of income from net oil exporters to net oil importers. 
Given world production of oil of about
 90 million barrels per day, a USD
 60 (per barrel) oil price decline, as observed since July
 2014, leads to an overall net income redistribution of 
approximately 2% of world GDP. As oil importers have, on average, a higher propensity to 
consume, global demand increases. Besides the euro area, most euro area trading partners are 

expected to gain from a fall in oil prices. 1 The International Energy Agency (IEA) repeatedly revised downwards projected oil demand, with 2015 global oil demand expected to 
decline by 0.8%.Chart A Global oil supply(annual changes in million barrels per day; quarterly data)3050

significant downward pressure on HICP inflation in the near term. Direct effects are visible 
in consumer energy prices with a short lag as movements in upstream oil prices are generally 

fully passed through to pre-tax consumer prices with a lag of only around three to five weeks. 
Lower energy prices may also influence other prices through indirect effects, probably feeding 

through later.2 In addition, they may trigger second-round effects in the behaviour of price and wage-setters. Changes in oil prices affect economic activity predominantly via real disposable income and 
corporate profits. A decline in oil prices has typically favourable effects for economic activity, 

as it leads to direct increases in real disposable income and profits. At the same time, the extent 

to which real disposable income and profits react to declining oil prices may vary considerably, 

depending on the factors underlying the decline in oil prices. If oil prices fall primarily as a result 

of ample supply, real disposable income and profits will clearly increase. However, if
 weak global demand drives oil prices down, at least part of the increase in purchasing power and 

profitability through lower energy prices will be eroded by lower foreign demand.Historical data confirm that real disposable income and profits react significantly to changes 
in oil prices. Chart C shows the development of energy prices and real disposable income. 
Real disposable income growth is broken down further into the gains and losses that are attributable 
to fluctuations in energy prices and to all other factors.

Issue 1 / 2015and profit margins growth, the latter approximated by GDP deflator growth minus unit labour 
cost growth. In the wake of the oil price hikes of 1999 and 2000, as well as those in the second half  of the 2000s, real disposable income and profit margins declined. At the time of the sharp 
drop in oil prices in 1986, which, as with the current drop, reflected primarily ample supply, 
 profit margins (for which data are available for a longer period) improved significantly 

as a consequence. By contrast, the fall in oil prices at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 coincided with very weak global demand, and both real disposable income and profits 
declined sharply. As the recent decline in oil prices appears persistent and follows primarily 

from supply factors, it should support real disposable income and profits.Overall, while the recent oil price decline is expected to significantly decrease HICP inflation 
in 2015, it should support euro area economic activity in
 2015 and 2016. In general, the effects of oil price changes on HICP inflation should be temporary as, at present, futures markets 

predict a gradual increase in oil prices. If these were to materialise, the downward impact of oil 

prices on HICP inflation will eventually wear off and oil prices will start contributing positively 

to HICP inflation in
 2016. Since the fall in oil prices seems to be mainly due to supply-related 
factors, the overall impact on euro area economic activity should be predominantly positive. 

This effect extends into 2016, as economic activity can generally be expected to react with a lag 
to lower oil prices.29ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015Box 6TRENDS IN PROFIT MARGINS OF EURO AREA NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONSProfit margins are an important factor in the development of output prices.
 They are typically seen as a mark-up on costs and their evolution can thus provide a gauge for the capacity 

or need of firms to pass on or absorb changes in different costs or charges in their output 

prices. Profit margins or profit developments are also relevant for real economic developments, 

e.g. investment. At the aggregate level, the role of profit margins in output price developments 
is often approximated by developments in gross operating surplus per unit of output (in short: 

gross unit profits) in relation to the growth in the GDP or value added deflators. However, for 

the different institutional sectors of the economy, the profit measure of gross operating surplus 

tends to capture rather different economic forces, and it also includes components that may not 

correspond to the notion of profits in a more narrow sense. Against this background, this box 

focuses on profit developments in the non-financial corporations (NFCs) sector (which accounts 

for roughly half of euro area gross operating surplus) and on underlying components of gross 

operating surplus.1 Profit margin developmentsProfit margins of NFCs fell sharply during the 2008/09 recession and declined also over 
the past two years (see Chart A). Profit margins as measured in terms of gross unit profits 

are driven by the interplay between developments in gross operating surplus in the numerator 

and real value added as a measure of output 

in the denominator. Their declines during the 

great recession and over the past two years are 
explained by sharper drops in gross operating 

surplus than in real value added. In 2014, some 
improvements in real value added contributed 

to the decreases in gross unit profits. Gross and net operating surplus
When activity slumped during the 2008 
crisis, gross operating surplus was squeezed 

and since then has remained below its 

earlier levels.
 In an environment of mostly 
subdued developments in nominal value 

added, this squeeze reflects the relatively small 

responsiveness of compensation of employees 

(see Chart B). As a consequence, the profit 
share (in value added) moved sharply down 
to a level below its longer-term average, 
after trending upwards before the crisis 1 For an analysis of profits focusing on the whole economy, see the box entitled ﬁThe role of profits in shaping domestic price pressures in the 
 euro areaﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, March 2013. For developments in profit margins of NFCs split into euro area external deficit and surplus 
countries, see the box entitled ﬁA sectoral account perspective of imbalances in the euro areaﬂ, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, February 2012.

Issue 1 / 2015(see Chart C). Over the past two years, the profit share has continued to weaken. These patterns 
are more pronounced when looking at net operating surplus, given that consumption of fixed 
capital and the associated costs of capital services increased unabated during the crisis. The net 

profit share is thus more visibly below its longer-term average and has more clearly continued to 

decline in the past two years than the gross profit share. The declines in the profit shares may have different reasons.
 On the one hand, they reflect 
the fact that in the weak economic environment prevailing for most of the period since 2008, the 

additional increases in labour and capital services costs could not be passed on to selling prices. 

On the other hand, profit shares had increased substantially prior to the 2008 crisis and in this 

respect, it is difficult to benchmark developments in profit shares as there is no reliable gauge of 

a truly long-run level of these shares. Net entrepreneurial income and net retained earnings
Net entrepreneurial income and net retained earnings have developed modestly over the 
past two years, but remained relatively more robust than net operating surplus.
 Subtracting 
from net operating surplus the costs for net interest payments and rental income paid and adding 
non-interest property income received (such as dividend income received and property income 

from insurance) provides the profit measure of net entrepreneurial income. Given declines in 

net interest payments and rental income paid in the past few years, and more recently some 

improvements in non-interest property income received (see Chart D), net entrepreneurial 

income has developed better than net operating surplus. From net entrepreneurial income, firms 

still have to pay, in particular, taxes on income and wealth and dividends; net retained earnings

such as net interest payments, dividend payments are at the discretion of companies, at least 

to the extent that they remain in line with shareholder value expectations. Dividend payments, 

therefore, provide companies with some leeway to influence their net retained earnings.
2 Due to lower dividend payments net retained earnings declined less than entrepreneurial income. The shares of net entrepreneurial income and net retained earnings in value added 
have recently stabilised or improved slightly. This contrasts with a continued decline 
in the corresponding shares for gross and net operating surplus. Moreover, the shares 
 of net entrepreneurial income and retained earnings stand slightly below the longer-term 
 average, but not at unprecedented low levels (see Chart E). The relative movements in the 

variables imply that downward price pressures from net unit profits on the growth in the value 

added deflator over the past year do not reflect a further squeeze in unit net retained earnings but 

rather declines in net interest payments and dividend payments. Conclusions
Bearing in mind that there is substantial heterogeneity across euro area countries, data for 
the euro area as a whole indicate that NFCs™ profit margins dropped strongly as profits 
were squeezed by increases in labour and capital services costs in the aftermath of the 

2008/2009 recession.
 This reflects the limited possibilities of companies to pass cost increases 

on to output prices in an environment of weak demand and needed competitiveness gains. Cost 

developments themselves have been increasing, at least relative to income, in view of low 

productivity growth and downward rigidities in wages. 2 In this respect, net retained earnings can also reflect NFCs™ choice with regard to generating external or internal financing funds, e.g.
 at times of constraints in access to external financing, or deleveraging pressures and the need for balance sheet repair. Chart D Non-financial corporations™ net

Issue 1 / 2015However, the more narrow profit measure of net entrepreneurial income and 
companies™ net retained earnings remained lately more robust than net profits.
 
This is the case as net entrepreneurial income was propped up by declines in costs such 
 as net interest payments and as net retained earnings was supported by decreases in 

dividend income paid. Other profitability measures for NFCs confirm these profit 

developments. Measures of the return on capital, such as the ratio of entrepreneurial 
 income to loans, bonds and equity net of cash, are currently at relatively low levels but showed 

some tentative signs of improvement in 2014. 33ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015Box 7FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACTOn 13 January the European Commission issued a Communication on ﬁmaking the 
best use of the flexibility within the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ as a 
 ﬁcontribution to developing a more growth-friendly fiscal stance in the euro areaﬂ. It will be  implemented with immediate effect. Without modifying existing regulations, it clarifies and at 

the same time extends the flexibility of applying the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) 

in three major areas: (i) cyclical conditions, (ii) structural reforms and (iii) public investment. 

This box outlines the main elements of the Communication and its implications for surveillance 

under the EU™s fiscal governance framework. The new treatment of cyclical conditions under the SGP™s preventive arm
Under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1466/1997, which lays down the provisions for EU 
countries under the SGP™s preventive arm, Member States which have not yet reached their 
medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) are required to pursue an annual improvement 

in their structural budget balance of 0.5% of GDP as a benchmark.
 The regulation further 

specifies that Member States with a debt level exceeding 60% of GDP or with pronounced risks 

of overall debt sustainability are required to achieve an annual improvement in their structural 

balance that is higher than 0.5% of GDP. In particular, in assessing the appropriateness of each 

country™s progress towards its MTO, the Council and the Commission have to assess whether ﬁa 
higher adjustment effort is made in economic good timesﬂ, whereas the effort ﬁmight be more 

limited in economic bad timesﬂ.The Commission™s Communication defines ﬁeconomic good timesﬂ and granulates economic 
developments which are worse than what is experienced in ﬁnormal timesﬂ into ﬁbadﬂ, ﬁvery 

badﬂ and ﬁexceptionally badﬂ economic times.1 To this end, it includes a matrix that specifies 
the fiscal adjustments needed, according to the size of the output gap and economic growth, for 

countries with government debt below 60% of GDP and for those with government debt above 

60% of GDP.2 According to this matrix, irrespective of the debt level, no fiscal adjustment 
is needed (which is equivalent to granting a waiver) in countries faced with ﬁexceptionally bad 

timesﬂ, defined by negative growth or an output gap of below -4% of GDP. In addition, in ﬁvery 

bad timesﬂ, defined by an output gap of between -3% and -4% of GDP, the required structural 

effort is reduced to zero and 0.25% of GDP for countries with debt below and above 60% of 

GDP, respectively. This compares with requirements of 0.1% and 0.5% of GDP for these groups 

of countries, respectively, in the 2014 European Semester. In ﬁnormal timesﬂ, defined by an 

output gap of between -1.5% and 1.5% of GDP, the required structural effort is 0.5% of GDP for 

countries with debt below 60% of GDP and above 0.5% of GDP for countries with debt above 

60% of GDP. In ﬁgood timesﬂ, defined by an output gap of above 1.5% of GDP, the required 

structural effort gradually increases to above 0.75% of GDP and above 1% of GDP for countries 

with debt below and above 60% of GDP, respectively. In this respect, the Communication goes 
 1 The Communication does not, however, define a severe economic downturn and thus the conditions for triggering the ﬁgeneral 
escape clauseﬂ (see Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1466/1997 and Article 3(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1467/1997), which allows 
structural adjustment under both the Pact™s preventive and corrective arms to be paused in the event of a severe economic downturn in 

the euro area or the EU as a whole as long as fiscal sustainability is not at risk.2 As a criterion within this matrix an assessment is made as to whether the economic situation is improving or deteriorating by 
distinguishing whether real growth exceeds or falls short of a country-specific potential growth rate.34ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 2015beyond the provisions of the existing SGP Code of Conduct, which states that ﬁin principle, 
economic ‚good times™ should be identified as periods where output exceeds its potential levelﬂ, 

i.e. periods in which the output gap is positive and larger than zero. Compared with previous 

requirements applied in the review of draft budgetary plans for 2015, for example, Italy™s required 

structural effort under the preventive arm would be halved to 0.25% of GDP, keeping in mind 
 that compliance with the debt rule is a binding requirement under the SGP.However, the output gap, which largely determines the adjustment requirements under 
the new decision matrix, is an unobservable variable subject to considerable revisions 
 over time. Past experience points to a negative real-time bias of the output gap of the order 

of 1% of GDP over the 2003-13 period.3 In particular, the boom period of 2006-07 was not 
identified as ﬁeconomic good timesﬂ in real time. Consequently, the required fiscal adjustment 

towards the MTO determined by the new matrix in real time might turn out to be smaller than the 

adjustment that would have been warranted based on ex post data. This could undermine the aim 

of the Pact™s preventive arm, which is to build buffers in economic good times.The treatment of structural reforms 
Under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1466/1997, countries may deviate from the 
adjustment path towards their MTO if they have implemented major structural reforms 

which improve long-term fiscal sustainability. The SGP Code of Conduct provides examples 

of major health, pension and labour market reforms but also clarifies that ﬁonly major reforms 

that have direct long-term positive budgetary effectsﬂ and ﬁa verifiable positive impact on the 
 long-term sustainability of public financesﬂ will be taken into account. Furthermore, the 

Code of Conduct specifies that ﬁonly adopted reforms should be consideredﬂ. Contrary to the 
 Code of Conduct, the Commission™s Communication provides that reforms can now also be 

taken into account ﬁex anteﬂ on the basis of a dedicated structural reform plan presented by the 

Member State. This plan should contain a timeline for the adoption and delivery of the reforms. 

In the absence of a methodological framework to gauge the budgetary costs of structural reforms 

in a consistent manner across time and countries, the Commission envisages granting countries 
a fiscal loosening for planned structural reforms in the form of a deviation from the adjustment 

path towards their MTO of up to 0.5% of GDP for up to four years. It would be useful to develop 

a methodological framework to gauge the short-term budgetary costs of structural reforms and to 

link any allowance to clearly quantified costs, also given the fact that not all structural reforms 

entail budgetary costs. Under the Pact™s corrective arm, i.e. the excessive deficit procedure (EDP), the Commission 
will take into account the existence of a dedicated structural reform plan, which must provide 

detailed and verifiable information as well as credible timelines for adoption and delivery, as 

a relevant factor when recommending opening a procedure and when setting the deadline for 

correction of the excessive deficit or extending that deadline. Importantly, the Commission 

has clarified that there is no trade-off between structural reforms and the delivery of ﬁeffective 

actionﬂ, i.e. countries subject to an excessive deficit procedure remain obliged to achieve their 

fiscal consolidation targets.3 See also Kamps, C., Leiner-Killinger, N., Sondermann, D., De Stefani, R. and Rüffer, R., ﬁThe identification of fiscal and

Occasional Paper Series,  
No 157, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, November 2014.35ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015The treatment of public investment The Commission™s Communication has re-established the ﬁinvestment clauseﬂ. This was applied in 2013 and 2014 but had been discontinued for 2015, allowing countries under the 

SGP™s preventive arm to deviate temporarily from the adjustment path towards their MTO to 

accommodate additional public investment. The investment clause was introduced by the 

Commission in 2013 by subsuming investment under the above-mentioned ﬁmajor structural 

reformﬂ clause of the SGP. This was controversial, as public investment is different in nature 

from structural reform. The clause now pertains to capital expenditure on projects co-funded 

by the EU, including the Structural and Cohesion Policy, the Trans-European Network and 

the Connecting Europe Facility as well as the newly established European Fund for Strategic 

Investment (EFSI)
4. While the activation of the old investment clause hinged on negative 
economic developments in the EU as a whole (i.e. negative GDP growth with a negative or a 

large negative EU output gap forecast), the new investment clause can be activated on the basis of 

economic developments in the Member State concerned (either negative GDP growth or an output 

gap below -1.5% of GDP). As with the old investment clause, Member States need to ensure a 

safety margin so that the 3% of GDP deficit reference value is respected. An important condition 
 that applied under the old investment clause has been dropped, as there is no longer any reference 

to compliance with the debt rule. In spring 2014 the Italian authorities™ request for activation of 

the investment clause was rejected by the Commission on the grounds that compliance with the 

debt rule was not ensured.Implications for EU fiscal surveillance 
The Commission™s Communication has implications for the implementation of the Pact™s 
preventive arm in particular.
 Specifically, the reduction of structural adjustment requirements 
can be quite substantial as countries can draw on all three provisions in a cumulative manner. 

While the flexibility of the SGP should be used to avoid fiscal policy hampering the economic 

recovery and to support structural reform, it has to be carefully calibrated in order not to 

undermine debt sustainability and thus the credibility of the Pact and its consistent application 

across countries and over time. In this context the reduction of adjustment requirements also for 
high-debt countries increases the risk of inconsistencies with the requirements under the debt 

rule. To avoid the mistakes of the pre-crisis governance framework being repeated, it is also 

important that the debt rule, which was one of the major lessons of the crisis, is not sidelined. 

There is also a need for a clear methodological framework for taking into account the budgetary 

costs of structural reforms. It is important in this respect that structural reforms are only taken into 
 account in the framework once they have actually been implemented.4 Cash contributions to the setting-up of the EFSI will not have an impact on the deficit, but will have an impact on debt if financed 
through government borrowing (as has been the case for financial contributions to the ESM), which will likely be dealt with through 
the consideration of relevant factors within the EDP framework.37ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015ARTICLEGROCERY PRICES IN THE EURO AREA: FINDINGS FROM THE ANALYSIS OF A DISAGGREGATED  PRICE DATASETThis article analyses the functioning of the Single Market and the determinants of price level differences 
across the euro area based on the main findings of an ESCB group of economists established to 

investigate a unique disaggregated dataset of grocery prices across euro area countries. 
The results illustrate the presence of significant border effects, as prices vary substantially more 
across countries than within countries. In terms of factors determining price level differences 

across countries, there is strong evidence of market segmentation. It is shown that, in addition 

to consumer habits, structural features, specifically the competitive situation at the producer and 

retail levels, have an impact on prices and price dispersion. The analysis also sheds light on other 
aspects that are relevant for understanding inflation dynamics within and between countries, 

such as the potential implications for inflation measurement arising from the appearance of new 

products and retail outlets.Overall, the analysis shows that further reform efforts that enhance entry into and improve contestability 
in goods markets and the distributive trades would contribute to a deepening of the Single Market.1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUNDThis article draws on a newly available dataset on grocery prices in the euro area, and follows 

up on the Eurosystem™s Structural Issues Report (SIR) 2011 on ﬁStructural features of 

distributive trades and their impact on prices in the euro areaﬂ.
1 That report discussed the role 
of the distributive trades sector, which acts as the main interface between producers of consumer 

goods and consumers. The aim of the report was to analyse the structural features Œ particularly the 
degree of competition and regulatory aspects Œ of the distributive (i.e. wholesale and retail) trades 
sector and their impact on price developments in the euro area. Among the main findings was a 

considerable degree of price dispersion across the euro area, with evidence of a ﬁborder effectﬂ 
among euro area countries, i.e. prices vary more across countries than within countries. 
The findings of the 2011 SIR suggested that there was ample scope for further improving the 

Single Market and that further progress in improving effective competition in the distributive 

trades sector could help narrow price differentials: however, a number of key issues in that 
report could not be fully addressed owing to the lack of suitable data. First, regarding the Single 

Market, while the finding of the continued existence of strong border effects appeared robust, the 

analysis was indirect. Second, although there was some interaction between retail concentration and 

price dynamics, the impact of concentration on price levels could not be analysed. Lastly, although 

the report was able to document the emergence of discounters and private labels (i.e.
 own-branded products), it was not able to provide an indication of the possible impact of these structural changes 

on inflation measurement. This article uses a proprietary disaggregated grocery price dataset
 2 to investigate some of these key issues. In particular, the article seeks to: (a) achieve a
 better understanding of the 
stylised structural features of euro area grocery prices; (b) examine and quantify the degree of price 
dispersion and the magnitude of border effects within the euro area; (c)
 investigate the factors,

(d) provide some indication of the possible impact of structural developments in the distributive

3 After describing the dataset, the article looks at some potential 
determinants of price level differences among euro area countries. It analyses the potential impact 

of the appearance of private label goods and structural shifts in store formats on the measurement of 

HICP inflation. The pass-through of VAT changes into consumer prices is also analysed. The data used in this article consist of around 3.5 million observations on the price and 
quantity of individual products sold over the period 2009-11, disaggregated across a number 

of dimensions (including countries, regions, products, brands, pack sizes and store types).
 
Prices of individual products are proxied by unit values (including VAT),
 i.e. calculated as total 
sales value over a given period divided by quantity of the product sold, while quantities are available 
in terms of both number of packages sold and ﬁequivalisedﬂ units of content sold (e.g.
 litre, kg, 
etc.).4 The richness of the data lies in their multidimensionality: they cover 13 euro area countries
5 Œ for which 70 regions and approximately ten kinds of store can be identified
 Œ as well as 45 product categories6, with details on four brands per product category, three stock-keeping units per brand and data on private label aggregates. The sample period spans primarily 2009-11, with 98.6% of 

monthly observations spanning the 37-month period from November 2008 to November 2011. 

While the dataset is rich and complex and has an overall estimated market coverage rate of around 

75%-85%, it is unbalanced (i.e.
 not all information is available across all dimensions).
7 The data 
were found to be representative, as they are highly congruent with both detailed country CPI data 

and detailed PPP data obtained from Eurostat, after controlling for pack size.2 EURO AREA GROCERY PRICE DISPERSION WITHIN AND ACROSS COUNTRIES 8Although there is some empirical evidence of a reduction in price dispersion over a longer time 

period in the euro area,
9 during the period under review (2009-11) price differences remain 
substantial across a range of goods, with evidence of only limited convergence (see Box 1). Notwithstanding their highly disaggregated nature, the data used here present the challenge, 

when investigating price dispersion, of considerable heterogeneity across product categories 

in different countries. Brands and specifications of products sold can differ substantially. 
 3 In order to benefit from country-specific expertise, an expert group of economists from across the ESCB was brought together to analyse 
the dataset. This article draws on the work and findings of this group.4 Prices excluding VAT have been calculated using information on VAT rates for each product category in each country.
5 The countries covered are Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia

most countries. There can be several reasons for this diversity, including a)
 the historical presence 
of brands, b)
 differences in domestic preferences, and c)
 regulations in product markets which 
may hinder the introduction of new brands. Moreover, the data available only cover a time span 
(2009-11) that includes a period of considerable economic stress in the euro area. For these reasons, 

the specific price differentials for individual products and countries reported in Box 1 should be 

considered as indicative. Furthermore, price is only one aspect of interest to consumers; other 

relevant features may be choice, quality and innovation.1010 In this context, see a recent (October 2014) study prepared for the European Commission entitled ﬁStudy on the economic impact of 
modern retail on choice and innovation in the EU food sectorﬂ, which examines whether increased concentration (of food retailers/food 
brand manufacturers) or other factors (such as shop type/size, private label penetration, socio-demographic characteristics) have affected 

choice and innovation for the consumer in European shops. (http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/agriculture/overview_en.html). Box 1CROSS-COUNTRY PRICE DIFFERENTIALSWhile there is considerable heterogeneity across product categories with regard to price 
level differences across countries, there are some common features. Namely, among the 
products and countries in the dataset, many products in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands 

tend to be relatively cheap, while they are relatively expensive in Belgium, Ireland and Greece 

(see Table). For other countries, the rankings are more mixed across product categories.However, some caveats should be borne in mind when using this dataset to compare 
price levels across countries.
 First, the products covered are food, personal and healthcare 

grocery goods; other categories, such as unprocessed food, energy, durable consumer goods 

or services, are not represented. Second, the sample period covers 2009-11. While some price 

adjustments occurred during this period in some euro area countries, additional adjustments may 

have been made since. Lastly, although broadly consistent, the coverage of store types differs 
across countries. Nonetheless, the broad features identified tend to hold for a variety of product 

subsamples that may be considered broadly comparable. They also hold for a very narrow subset 

of products that have been identified as being an exact match across countries.During the period under review, there is substantial price dispersion with only limited 
convergence. The highly diverse unit prices across countries for the product categories under 
investigation can be seen when the median unit price difference is compared with the euro 

area average over time, while the median unit price difference across countries shows limited 

convergence. In fact, the median prices excluding VAT have shown convergence towards the 

euro area average only in Ireland, Greece and Austria. For branded goods, Ireland and Greece 

have become less expensive, with a cumulative drop of 3 and 6 percentage points respectively 

compared with average prices over the period 2009-11, while branded goods in Austria have 

become less cheap by a total of 2 percentage points (see Table).
1 It should be noted that the 
brand-level data on prices and volumes show that Ireland and Greece tend to be either the most

the median unit price for some countries no longer converges.40ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 2015expensive or among the most expensive countries in a majority of the product categories, while 
Germany and Spain tend to be among the least expensive countries. This is consistent with 

observed differences in producer market characteristics. Namely, Greece and Ireland tend, on 

balance, to have higher market shares for the leading brand in most of the product categories, 

thus implying higher monopoly power and higher mark-ups. At the same time private label 

goods tend to have low shares of the market in these countries. By contrast, Germany and Spain 

seem to be characterised by significantly lower market shares for the leading producers and a 

significantly higher share of private label products. Consumer behaviour also seems to differ. On 

average, Greek and Irish consumers tend to buy smaller pack sizes and have lower consumption 

intensities of the products included in the data, while German and Spanish consumers display 

the opposite behaviour. For a more detailed discussion of possible factors underlying price 

differentials, see Section 3 of this article.Price dispersion remains even when controlling for quality differences.
 In order to control
 Œ at least in part
 Œ for effects stemming from quality differences that may be reflected in prices, 
the unit prices of branded market leaders are also considered. By definition, market leaders 
in each region tend to have a broad consumption base and are characterised by good quality. 

They offer, in the eyes of the consumer, reasonable value for money. Moreover, for several 

product categories the market leaders across countries are the same producers (offering the same 

products). Nevertheless, even in this case the mean and median price difference between the 

cheapest and most expensive regions across the euro area countries is a full 220% and 181%, 
respectively. The price differences remain substantial, even in a comparison of the 25th and 75th 

percentiles.2 Price differences suggest markets may be segmented as they reflect data aggregated 

geographically (across urban and rural areas) and, as such, do not, in general, reflect a 

single expensive or cheap location. It would be more understandable if such price differences 2 This country-specific clustering of prices may also reflect the impact of possible territorial supply constraints. It should be noted that 
the country rankings in terms of most/least expensive do not generally change, even if unit prices include VAT.Median difference from euro area average price level (excl.

less affluent, primarily rural, district. Instead, it is generally the case that, when prices outside 

the inter-quartile (i.e. 25th to 75th percentile) range are disregarded, some countries do not 

figure. For example, in the case of paper towels, there are no prices from Greece (the most 

expensive country) or from the Netherlands (the cheapest country) inside the inter-quartile range 

(see Chart). Indeed, for several product categories, a country-specific price clustering is often 

observed, irrespective of whether or not (i) the market leader is the same across regions within 
a country, or (ii) the market leader is the same across countries

Issue 1 / 2015Notwithstanding the caveats regarding the measurement of price dispersion, the regional 
dimension of the dataset makes it possible to obtain a more robust indication of the border 

effect than was feasible heretofore: cross-country dispersion is significantly higher than cross-
regional variation within countries, suggesting substantial border effects in the euro area. This 

result confirms the indirect evidence of border effects reported in the SIR 2011, which used purchasing 

power parity (PPP) data (see Box 2 for a comparison). Price dispersion of unit prices is investigated 
by using coefficients of variation, defined as the standard deviation of a unit price for a product over 

the mean unit price for that product. Cross-country price dispersion is about five to seven times 

higher than within-country price dispersion, irrespective of whether one considers the full sample 

of products or varieties of product subsamples that may be broadly comparable or even identical 
 (see Table 1). For the full range of products in the dataset (including private label goods), the average 
unit price dispersion is 37% across countries, compared with an average price dispersion of about 

5% across regions within a country. Even for the set of identical products, the average unit price 

dispersion for the exact same product is 20% across countries and 4% within countries.

 Detailed product-level data, derived from so-called 
ﬁQuaranta tablesﬂ that are used to validate raw price data and for quality control purposes, are 
utilised. This exercise has three benefits. First, it demonstrates the congruity of the disaggregated 

price dataset utilised in the rest of this article. Second, it illustrates that the border effect 

documented in the SIR 2011 using data from 2009 is still present in updated data (from 2012 and 

2013). Third, it allows for a comparison with the same product types (food and beverages) and 

with another product group (home and garden, such as home electronics, paint, toys).1 Despite substantial methodological differences, the two (disaggregated grocery price and 

PPP) datasets are highly congruent. Although the PPP dataset generally only includes data 

collected in capital cities (with some exceptions)2, Charts A and B show that for two selected 
product types (a well-known ready-to-eat cereal brand and refrigerated milk), the ranking of prices 

across countries is almost identical to that seen in the disaggregated price dataset used in the main 
1 These product categories are an important element of consumers™ goods baskets. Food accounts for 20% of the overall HICP, while 
home and garden products account for around 13%, which is almost half of the non-energy industrial goods component. In addition, 
they concern strongly traded product categories and are therefore good test cases for the impact of national borders.2 In Germany, data are collected for four cities (Berlin, Bonn, Karlsruhe and Munich).43ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015text of this article. Although there are some 
deviations, these tend to be relatively minor and 

may relate to technical factors, such as pack 

size preferences across countries (see Section 3 
of this article for a more detailed discussion).The border effect as documented in the 
SIR 2011 in food, beverage and tobacco 

products has remained largely unchanged. Chart C shows the variation in prices within 

countries/capital cities and across countries/
capital cities in the countries of the euro 

area for 400 detailed food, beverage and 

tobacco products in both 2009 and 2012. 

The impact of national borders is clearly 

visible, since the variation of prices is almost 

always larger across countries than within 

countries. This result also holds if only 

named brands are considered; this allows us 

to control for potential quality differentials. 

The SIR 2011 also confirmed that this larger 

variation across borders was not the mere

Issue 1 / 2015result of geographical distance, as while price 
dispersion across four (fairly near) capital 

cities is lower than the euro area average, 

it is much higher than across four large 

German cities that are geographically much 

further apart. Thus, the findings of Reiff and 

Rumler3 Œ that although distance matters, 
borders matter more Œ appear to be robust.In addition to confirming the previous 

analysis for food and beverages, the updated 

PPP data also provide compelling evidence 

for a border effect when it comes to home and 

garden products (e.g. home electronics, paint, 

toys) Œ see Chart D. These products arguably 
provide for an even better test case for the 

existence of a border effect, as they more often 

tend to have named brands, are highly tradable/
traded and local preferences might be a less 

important factor influencing prices than in the 

case of food products. Again, it is the case that 

price variation across countries is much higher 

than within countries, both for all products together and for named brands only. Also, the charts for 

the Benelux countries and the German cities (not reported) provide qualitatively similar results.Overall, the analysis of the PPP dataset strongly supports the conclusions arrived at 
through the investigation of the disaggregated price data.3 Reiff, A. and Rumler, F., op. cit.Overall the data indicate that (a)
 there is considerable price dispersion across countries, even when specific brands are considered, and (b) price dispersion is substantially higher across countries than within countries (i.e. strong border effects exist).3 F
ACTORS EXPLAINING GROCERY PRICE LEVEL DIFFERENCES11Some price variation can be explained by distance Œ even within an individual country Œ but cross-country borders impact more. This is demonstrated when estimating a distance-based 
relative price equation which also controls for borders. The results show that the greater the distance 

between two regions, the greater the relative price variation but also that there is always a discrete, 

large jump in observed relative price differences at the border. By way of example, for the subset of 

identical products, it is estimated that relative prices differ by approximately 1% on average between 

two locations that are 100 km apart but within the same country. By contrast, if two locations are 

100 km apart and are separated by a border, then relative prices differ by approximately 19.5%. 

Changes in relative prices also depend positively on distance, i.e.
 the closer the two locations, the more prices co-move. However, even in this case there is a discrete jump at the border. 11 This section draws from Reiff, A. and Rumler, F., op. cit.; Petroulas, P. and Kosma, T., op. cit.; and Ciapanna, E. and Rondinelli, C., ﬁRetail

Sources: Eurostat PPP database, Nielsen and Eurosystem staff 
calculations.45ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015Price level differences and the associated border effects can be partly explained by observable 
factors. These include VAT differences between countries (see Box
 3), income differences (measured as GDP per capita), regional unemployment as a share of the labour force and regional 

population density. However, even after controlling for these factors in a regression, the estimated 

border effect remains significant.12 Price dispersion across countries may also be affected by the relative state of the business 

cycle. Upon regressing price dispersion on a European business cycle indicator, a variable capturing 
the spread of the business cycle position and a lagged dependent variable, it becomes evident that 

business cycle conditions have important effects on European price dispersion. Specifically, the 

estimates indicate that European price dispersion tends to be pro-cyclical
 Œ higher during upturns and lower during downturns Œ and is sensitive to diverging business cycle conditions. In this 
respect, the time period of investigation is also significant for the estimated border effects. 12 One reason may be that estimated border coefficients are biased upwards as the distribution of prices differs across countries. By using the 
disaggregated grocery price dataset it is estimated that cross-border price dispersion can be inflated by as much as 25% if cross-country 
differences in price distributions are not taken into account. See Gorodnichenko, Y. and Tesar, L.L., ﬁBorder Effect or Country Effect? 

Seattle May Not Be So Far from Vancouver After All.ﬂ, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 1(1), 2009, pp. 219-241.Box 3THE PASS-THROUGH OF VAT RATE CHANGES INTO CONSUMER PRICES1In Europe, value added taxes (VAT) play an important role in consumer prices. Most 
countries have a standard rate of VAT somewhere between 15% and 25%.
2 Furthermore, in 
recent years a number of countries have changed (mostly increased) their VAT rates. This is due 

in large part to the impact of the financial crisis and budgetary pressures, but has also occurred 

in the context of a shifting of the tax burden away from labour towards indirect consumption-
type taxes. The Chart illustrates that the average euro area standard rate remained relatively 

constant between 1999 and 2007, at around 18.5%, although there were some country-specific 

changes. In January 2007 there was a large jump owing to the 3.0 percentage point change in 

the German standard rate of VAT from 16.0% to 19.0%. Thereafter, the average rate remained 

relatively stable for about three years, at slightly below 19.5%. However, since the economic 

crisis in 2008 there have been a cluster of VAT rate changes and the aggregate standard rate has 

increased to over 20.5% (as at 1 July 2014). Since the launch of EMU in 1999, there have been 
approximately 30 VAT rate changes, of which two-thirds have occurred since the economic 

crisis. Clearly, it is of interest to policy-makers to understand how these changes are passed 

through into consumer prices.31 This box draws from Meyler, A., ﬁVAT pass-through: is there any value-added in a disaggregated cross-country and cross-product 
analysis?ﬂ, Working Paper Series, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, forthcoming.2 For a useful overview of existing VAT rates in the European Union and how these have changed over time, see http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/ and in particular the document ﬁVAT Rates Applied in the Member States of 
the European Unionﬂ, which is updated twice a year in January and July
 Œ http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf.3 In addition to VAT rate changes, VAT rates may also have an impact on price level differences across countries (see Sections 2 and 
3). In the dataset there is a wide range of (standard and reduced) VAT rates across countries and products. For example, in Estonia 

and Slovakia, the standard VAT rate is applied to nearly all of the products included in the dataset, whereas in Belgium, Spain, the 

Netherlands and Slovenia, it is applied to fewer than 40% of the products.46ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 2015Assessing the degree of pass-through of VAT rate changes is challenging, particularly when 
focusing on individual country data. This is because, in some countries, VAT rates changed a 

number of times in relatively quick succession and more recent VAT rate changes have occurred 

in a challenging macroeconomic environment which may confound the effect of VAT changes 

with other developments. To a large extent the country-specific studies estimating the pass-

through of VAT rate changes rely on individual HICP subcomponents with long time series of 

available data.
4 These approaches are not possible in the case of the dataset used here as the data 
sample is too short. An additional problem is that prices change for reasons other than VAT rate 

developments. In this regard, work from the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network showed 
that although prices may change relatively infrequently on average, when they do change they 

tend to do so by large steps both upwards and downwards (around 10% on average).
5 In this context, the effects of VAT rate changes of the magnitude 0.5-2.0 percentage points are not easy 

to detect. One alternative approach to estimating the pass-through of VAT rate changes is the 
so-called difference-in-differences approach, which takes advantage of the additional 

information from the dataset both across countries and across product categories.
 That 
is, differences in price developments of ﬁtreatedﬂ groups (products/countries where the VAT 

rate changed) and ﬁcontrolﬂ groups (products/countries where the VAT rate did not change) are 

analysed to estimate the impact of VAT rate changes.
6 The sample period covered by the dataset 
allows us to investigate VAT rate changes in six countries: Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Spain, 

Portugal and Slovakia.4 See, for instance, ﬁA preliminary assessment of the effect on inflation of the increase in value added tax ratesﬂ,

passed through in the month of the rate change. Thus, in the context of the economic crisis and 

heightened competition, some of the impact of the VAT rate changes may have been absorbed 

by margins. The estimation results also suggest that, among branded goods, the estimated pass-

through of VAT rate changes is lowest for the market leader. These results are broadly in line 

with theoretical expectations that firms with lower margins are obliged to pass through changes, 

but those with some degree of monopoly power may absorb some of the changes.7Although the relatively low precision and high uncertainty of the individual estimates need 

to be borne in mind, the analysis of VAT rate pass-through exploiting cross-country and 

cross-product information has provided some insight regarding food and personal care 

goods prices. To extend the results to other categories (e.g. services prices), a more systematic 

availability of micro consumer price data would be useful.7 For a fuller discussion see Fullerton, D. and Metcalf, G.E., ﬁTax Incidenceﬂ, 
Handbook of Public Economics
, Vol. 4, ed. Alan J. 
Auerbach and Martin Feldstein. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2002.Nonetheless, the overall conclusion that there are significant border effects within the single 
currency area is robust when controlling for distance, for the differences in the distribution of 

individual prices and for diverging business cycle positions across countries. One possible explanation of protracted differences in price levels across countries lies in 
market segmentation (i.e. price discrimination), which may be related to differences in retail 
market concentration, competition between producers, bargaining power allocation between 

producers and retailers, differences in consumer habits and differences in local costs such as 

wages and rents. Retail market structure may have an impact on price levels, albeit in a complex manner.
 On the one hand, increased retail market concentration (or less competition) ﬁdownstreamﬂ or closer to 

the consumer Œ i.e. at the store and parent company levels
 Œ is associated with higher prices. On the 
other hand, increased retail concentration ﬁupstreamﬂ or closer to the producer
 Œ i.e. at the buying group level Œ is associated with lower prices.13,14 Whether the downstream or upstream effects 
dominate is largely an empirical question. A statistically significant upward impact on prices from 

increased concentration (lower competition) at the parent company level is found by regressing 

price levels on regional concentration indices.
15 By contrast, the indications of a downward impact 
on prices arising from higher concentration at the buying group level are not robust across product 

categories. On balance, the results suggest that a lower degree of regional competition (higher 

concentration) at the parent company level is associated with higher prices. 13 A buying group is an organisation of retailers that combines the bargaining power of its members in order to be able to purchase goods at 
a more advantageous rate than might be achieved through individual negotiation. 14 See Ciapanna, E. and Colonna, F., ﬁThe effect of retail sector concentration on prices and SME performance in Italyﬂ, 2011, mimeo.
15 These findings are based on econometric investigations where the following equation was estimated at the regional level: 
 ln pij = ai + bk + BGj + PCj + j + ij where the dependent variable is the average price level (net of the VAT and in natural logs) for 
good i sold in region
 j 
and the main explanatory variable is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), computed at the buying group (
HBGj) and at the parent company level (
HPCj). Other control variables are included in the vector 
 and are comprised of regional dummies, 
regional population density, regional per capita GDP and the regional unemployment rate. 48ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 2015These results suggest that appropriate competition-enhancing policies (for example, the 
removal of zoning restrictions, retail outlet size restrictions or population-based restrictions) 

might benefit consumers by lowering prices.In view of the evidence of both microeconomic (market structure, consumer attitudes) and 
macroeconomic (position in the cycle) determinants of price differences, it is important to 

try to holistically account for as many factors as possible at the same time.
 This is done by 

regressing relative prices on possible explanatory variables split into four main categories.161. Competition in the producer market, which is captured by: (a)
 the relative quantity share of the 
market leader, which can be seen as a relative measure of monopoly power; (b)
 the relative quantity 
share of other brands that are not the market leaders; and (c)
 the relative quantity share of private 
label products.2. Consumer attitudes, which are measured by: (a)
 consumption intensity, calculated as the number 
of units sold per person per month in a location;17 and (b) consumer cost indifference, measured as the average pack size (while there is a negative relationship between pack size and unit price, it is 
still the consumer™s choice which pack size to buy).
3. Retail market concentration indices for: (a)
 the parent group level, and b)
 the buying group 
level.18 4. Other regional variables which may be important for determining price levels, such as (a)
 local costs such as wages and rents, (b)
 GDP per capita, (c)
 the unemployment rate, (d)
 population density, (e) VAT rates, and (f) a dummy variable capturing promotions.19 The results suggest that there is scope for lowering price dispersion (and lowering prices in 
some countries) by implementing product market reforms that aim to reduce the rents of 

the incumbent producers (i.e. the market leaders) and ease the potential entry and growth of 
new producers (increasing competition) Œ see Table 2. Significant effects on prices from retail 
market concentration are also found that depend on the level of aggregation (buying group vs. 

parent group), confirming that relevant policies regarding retail structures may indeed be beneficial 

for consumers. Perhaps reflecting the labour-intensive nature of this sector, differences in wages 

of low-skilled workers are also found to be important in explaining observed price differences, 

as are differences in rents (albeit not as robustly). The variables capturing the macroeconomic 

environment (such as regional GDP per capita, population density, unemployment) do not seem 

as important at the regional level, while VAT differences are significant in explaining price 

differences across countries. Finally, the variables capturing consumer attitudes (willingness 
16 The relative price equation estimated is set up whereby the unit price of a brand for a specific product in a region is expressed relative to 
the unit prices of the minimum price location (based on the market leaders in each location). All explanatory variables are expressed in 
similar relative terms and quantity-based variables are instrumented with their third lag to avoid simultaneity. 17 For example, Italy has a relatively high consumption intensity of pasta. Therefore, the price of pasta may be more important to, and 
monitored more by, Italian consumers compared with the price of, say, strawberry jam. 18 Measured as Herfindahl-Hirschman indices calculated at 5 km radii which are then averaged up to the regions. 
19 Promotions are defined as a price that drops by more than 6.25% (implying a 25% reduction in a week, which is a typical promotion 
period) in a month and increases by more than 6.25% in the next. Time dummies and dummies controlling for product equivalising units 

are also included.49ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015to consume private label goods, preferred pack sizes, etc.) are significant and economically 
meaningful. In this respect it is important to educate and inform consumers, stressing that their 

habits may affect prices.4 POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGES IN THE GROCERY RETAIL STRUCTURE FOR INFLATION 
MEASUREMENT 20The potential for bias in inflation measurement has long been recognised.
 The Boskin 

Commission Report (1996)21 highlighted four main sources of possible bias: (i)
 product substitution bias, which occurs with a fixed-weight consumption basket that fails to reflect the fact that consumers 
tend to substitute less expensive goods for more expensive goods when relative prices change; 

(ii) outlet substitution bias, which occurs when shifts to lower price outlets (e.g. discounters) are not adequately captured; (iii)
 quality change bias, which occurs when improvements in the quality 
of products are either estimated inaccurately or not at all; and (iv)
 new product bias, which occurs when new products are introduced into the consumption basket in a sufficiently timely manner. 

Another source of possible inflation measurement error is the lack of weighting at the elementary 

index level.2220 This section draws from Gabor, E. and Vermeulen, P., ﬁNew evidence on elementary index biasﬂ, Working Paper Series, No 1754, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, December 2014; McQuade, P., ﬁSubstitution to private label products: Evidence from euro area retail scanner dataﬂ,

Issue 1 / 2015Evidence of the magnitude of inflation measurement bias in euro area countries is relatively 
scarce and generally relates to the late 1990s.
 Examples of studies considering new outlet bias 
are: Lequiller (1997) for France, who suggests a range of 0.05 percentage point to 0.15 percentage 

point per annum; Hoffmann (1998) for Germany, who argues that the effect is ﬁunlikely to exceed 

0.1 percentage point annuallyﬂ; and Covas and Silva (1999) for Portugal, who, using Portuguese 

micro data, found that the effect had changed over time, ranging between 0.25 and 0.50 percentage 

point per annum.23More recent work on the subject of inflation measurement highlights the uncertainty 

surrounding estimates of inflation measurement bias in terms of both sign and magnitude 

and the fact that these estimates may vary over the business cycle.
24 Linz (2009) discusses the 
impact of a new weighting system on German inflation which gives a higher weight to discounters 

than previously and results in upward revisions to inflation owing to the pass-through of commodity 

price shocks. Handbury et al. (2013), using Japanese scanner data for grocery prices, find an upward 

bias on average over a long time period, which eventually turns from being positive to negative. 

Greenlees and McClelland (2011), using data from the United States, find that that the upward 

impact on prices from improved item quality offsets most of the downward impact of lower-priced 

outlets. Lastly, Kryvstov (2013), using Canadian data, argues that quality bias is not an important 
source of potential mismeasurement of CPI inflation in Canada.A number of features of the disaggregated price dataset used in this article enable an analysis 
of the cross-country evidence on possible inflation measurement issues for the euro area. First, 
as information both on market shares and average prices is available across store types, the possible 

implications for inflation measurement of structural changes in retail formats can be considered 

(see Box 4). Second, when constructing consumer price indices, price differences between private 
label and branded goods are usually implicitly attributed entirely to quality differences (thus the 

price level shift which occurs when consumers turn to cheaper private label products is not taken 

into account); however, indirect empirical evidence on the substitution between private label and 

branded goods using the disaggregated grocery price data suggests that this may not entirely be the 

case.25 Lastly, as data are available on the volume of sales as well as the average unit price of these 
sales, the possible impact of the lack of weighting at the elementary index level on consumer price 

indices can be considered. One caveat is in order: as data are available only for selected grocery 

goods, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the potential for mismeasurement of overall 

inflation. Nonetheless, important insights may be obtained and areas for further research identified. The noteworthy differences in price levels across different store types (even when controlling 
for composition effects) and structural changes in store formats (notably the emergence of 

discounters and the relative decline of traditional store types) could have implications for

 Such structural changes may imply mismeasurement in official inflation 
statistics if the price level differences between store types do not only reflect quality differences in 

the retail service provided (as is normally assumed when new outlets enter the samples) or if price 

changes differ across outlet types and statistical offices are slow to reflect the changing importance 

of different outlet types in the outlet weights used. Differences in market share and price dynamics 

are found across store types. Most noticeably, over the period 2009-11, both the relative price 

and relative market share of discounters increased slightly. These two effects counteract each 

other. Overall, over the period considered, the net impact on measured inflation does not seem 

to be economically significant, at less than 0.1 percentage point of the annual inflation rate.
26 The negligible impact may be due to the fact that, over the sample period considered, the potential 

upward bias arising from a substitution effect away from discounters owing to an increase in their 

relative prices was being counteracted by a downward bias arising from a market share effect as 

discounters became more attractive in the context of the slowdown in economic activity.Prices for private label goods are, on average, substantially lower than those for branded 
goods Œ see Box 4. Combined with the evidence of substitution between private label and branded 
goods this suggests implications for inflation measurement. Estimates show that private label goods 

and branded goods are substitutes
 Œ thus resulting in an upward bias Œ but also that private label goods have seen larger price increases than branded goods over the sample period, which, when 

combined with an increased market share (the share of private label goods has increased during the 

economic slowdown), results in a downward bias. A priori, the overall net effect is ambiguous.26 Hausman and Leibtag (2009) estimate for the United States that the outlet substitution effect (together with new outlet bias) is significant 
and might even reach 18% of the measured inflation rate (in other words, suggesting that the CPI is overestimated by 0.42 percentage 
point per annum). See Hausman, J. and Leibtag, E., ﬁCPI Bias from Supercenters: Does the BLS Know that Wal-Mart Exists?ﬂ, 
NBER 
Working Paper Series, No 10712, August 2004.Box 4STRUCTURAL SHIFTS IN STORE FORMATS AND THE EVOLUTION OF PRIVATE LABEL GOODSThis box provides a descriptive overview of two noteworthy developments relating to grocery prices in the euro area, namely the evolution of store formats and the emergence of private label 
goods.Store formatsStructural shifts in grocery retail and differences in price evolutions across store types need 
to be taken into account when measuring inflation. There is considerable heterogeneity across 

countries in terms of the structure of grocery retail, reflecting a combination of factors, such as 

historical legacies, societal preferences, socio-geographical factors and regulatory conditions. 

Even so, there has been a widespread increase in the market share of discounters, while shares 

for smaller grocers and specialist retailers have fallen (see also the SIR 2011). Furthermore, there 

tend to be substantial differences on average in the price levels found across the different store 

types for the product categories investigated. All other things being equal, discounters generally 

tend to be cheapest, followed by hypermarkets and large supermarkets, with small supermarkets, 
52ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 2015traditional stores and other store types (such as pharmacies and specialised outlets) being, on 
average, more expensive.1Private label goodsSimilarly, growth of private label goods also needs to be reflected in inflation measurement.
 Partially in response to, but also as a result of, the emergence of discounters, private label (or
 own label) brands by retailers themselves have emerged. As reported in the SIR 2011, the market 

share of private label goods has been increasing steadily in the euro area and, more generally, the 

penetration of private label goods in the market for packaged food is higher in western Europe 

than in any other geographical region. There are substantial price differences between private label and branded goods. The data 
suggest that these are around 35% on average. However, these differences decline slightly 

over the sample period. At the same time the market share of private label goods has increased. 
The discount of private label goods relative to branded labels varies across countries, and is 

largest for Slovenia, Belgium and Greece and smallest for Italy and the Netherlands. The share of 

private label goods is relatively low in Estonia, Italy and Greece, and relatively high in Germany 

and Spain.Across product categories, a noteworthy feature of private label goods prices is the positive 
relationship between their share of the market and their price relative to branded goods.
 
Product categories with a relatively small share of private label goods have a large discount 
1 Price differences vis-à-vis discounters, controlling for the composition of goods sold, range on average from 1% up to 17% depending on store type. It should be noted that apparent price differences are larger if the composition of goods (such as the share of private label 
goods, premium brands, etc.) is not controlled for.Ratio of private label to branded goods prices and private label market share (2009-11)0.30.4

This is due to the nature of the goods as well as consumer 
perceptions.2 For instance, consumers appear to perceive little difference between private label 
goods and branded goods for products such as paper towels and tissue paper and therefore (i)
 are willing to consume private label goods, resulting in a high market share for private labels, and 

(ii) will not pay a large premium for branded products, resulting in a relatively low discount 

for private labels. On the other hand, for personal care products, such as deodorants, shampoo, 

condoms and toothpaste, consumers appear to place greater emphasis on brands and therefore 

(a) are not willing to consume private label goods, resulting in a low market share, and (b) are 

willing to pay a substantial premium for branded products.While the net competition effects of private label goods may be unclear a priori,3 an 
increase in the market penetration of private label goods will exert downward pressure on 

price levels, as such goods are generally cheaper (other things being equal).4However, determining the impact of increased market shares for discount stores and 

private label brands on inflation measurement is more challenging and cannot be 

assessed ex ante. On the one hand, to the extent that price differences are not entirely the result 

of quality differences, it would imply an upward bias in inflation measurement. On the other 

hand, although the price of private label goods is, on average, lower than for branded goods, 

the rate of change in unit prices has been higher for private label goods than for branded goods 

over the sample period for the goods in the dataset. With an increasing market share, this 

could suggest some downward bias. Which effect dominates may vary over time and could 

depend, to some extent, on the business cycle.2 In general, goods which are relatively generic or ﬁcommoditisedﬂ are more likely to be offered as private label goods (e.g. canned and 
packaged food products, tissues and kitchen towels, etc.), while goods which have a higher degree of product differentiation and/or 
for which advertising or quality is of great importance (e.g. cosmetics, alcoholic drinks, baby food, etc.) tend to exhibit a lower level 

of private label penetration. J. Steenkamp et al. report that private label brand penetration is highest for certain categories of food and 

beverage and household products, but lower for many personal care products. In addition, they report that in countries where consumers 

have low trust in firms and institutions, private label penetration is likely to be low. See Steenkamp, J., Geyskens, I., Gielens, K. and 

Koll, O., ﬁA global study into drivers of private label successﬂ, commissioned by AIM Œ European Brands Association, 2004.3 The existence of private label goods may offer consumers more choice and may counteract the bargaining power of the producers of large 
brands. However, a high penetration of private label goods might give retailers excessive market power, particularly if competition in the 

retail sector itself is insufficiently high. In addition, smaller brands might get squeezed out of the market by a combination of large branded 

and large private label goods. Thus, the overall effect on competition is not straightforward. For a more detailed analysis, see ﬁThe impact 

of private labels on the competitiveness of the European food supply chainﬂ, European Commission, 2011.4 The 2004 study by J. Steenkamp et al. (op. cit.) found that ﬁaggregated across all FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) categories, 
manufacturer brands are priced higher than private labels in all regionsﬂ, but noted that the price premium varies by a substantial 

amount across countries and products.Considering the issue of weighting at the elementary index level, it is known that the choice 
of index formula for measuring consumer price inflation matters.
27 Official consumer price 
indices are generally constructed by a weighted aggregation of lower level index aggregates, where 

weights are based on expenditure information. However, at the level of individual products, for 

example different brands of the same product, usually no expenditure weights are available and the 

basic price indices for finely defined products (so-called elementary indices) are usually constructed 

using unweighted averages of price observations. For example, to construct a coffee price index, 

statistical offices normally construct an unweighted price average based on a sample of different 

brands, although they might sell at quite different and unknown quantities. The use of unweighted 
27 For an early exposition of this issue, see Silver, M., ﬁElementary Aggregates, Micro-indices and Scanner Data: Some Issues in the 
Compilation of Consumer Price Indicesﬂ, 
Review of Income and Wealth
, International Association for Research in Income and Wealth, 
Vol. 41, No 4, December 1995, pp. 427-438.54ECBEconomic Bulletin
Issue 1 / 2015price averages to construct lower level indices of finely defined products is not so much made by 
choice but by necessity. This begs the question of whether the absence of expenditure weights at the 

lower levels of aggregation matters for inflation measurement.28The data used in this article allow for an investigation of the index level issue, as expenditure 

(sales) shares can be calculated at the elementary level, and a comparison of unweighted and 

weighted price indices for individual products indeed finds that weighting at the elementary 

level may have significant effects.
 These effects may be both positive and negative. Furthermore it 

seems that, although these effects do not offset each other upon aggregation, there is no systematic 

positive or negative effect across countries, products and aggregation levels. Thus, while weighting 

at the elementary level can substantially change measured inflation, the mismeasurement can be 

both upwards and downwards and the net effects are not systematic.Overall, the analysis illustrates that there is considerable uncertainty, not only in terms of the 
magnitude but also of the direction of potential biases in inflation measurement
 (see Table 3). For instance, developments in the period 2009-11 suggest that, although relative prices for private 

label goods and discounters were increasing, they also increased their share of the market. While 

this combination may be due in part to the effect of the economic crisis, it suggests that the upward 

bias discussed in the literature cannot be assumed, but must be assessed empirically. In this context, 

ongoing work by the European Statistical System to investigate the information content of scanner 

data and its use in official price statistics is welcome.295 CONCLUSIONSOverall, the analysis underscores the need to maintain progress with reform efforts that 

enhance entry into and improve contestability in the consumer goods industries and 

distributive trades. The analysis of the dataset containing disaggregated information on grocery 

prices across euro area countries has provided a number of unique and valuable insights into 

grocery prices in the euro area. In particular, the results highlight substantial deviations from the 

law of one price and strong market segmentation along national borders, implying that there is 
28 Note that this question is different from the issue of whether there may be a bias at the elementary index level owing to the typical 
substitution behaviour of consumers, as discussed for example in the Boskin Commission Report.29 For an overview of recent work by European statistical institutes in this area, see papers presented at the ﬁWorkshop on Scanner Data for 
HICPﬂ, hosted by Statistics Portugal, Lisbon, from 26 to 27 September 2013: http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_
sem_lista&tipo=r&detalhe=165101941 Table 3 Summary of inflation measurement analysesIssueEffectStore formatOn average, evidence of negligible and insignificant upward CPI bias. Small net effect perhaps due to 

substitution away from store formats with higher price increases being counteracted by income, where 

consumers turn to stores that are cheaper Œ but have higher price increases. Private label goodsIndirect evidence points to potential upward CPI bias (as estimates show that private label goods and branded 

goods are substitutes and private label goods have relatively larger price increases) being counteracted over 

the sample by a market share effect (share of private label increasing owing to economic slowdown). The net 

effect is ambiguous.Elementary weightingWeighting at the elementary level can substantially change measured inflation both upwards and downwards 

both at the elementary level and at a more aggregated level, compared with using unweighted elementary 

aggregates. However, the effects are not systematic.55ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015much progress still to be made in developing the Single Market. Price level differences are shown to be a function of the structure in retail and producer markets, where the competitive situation is of 

particular importance, but where consumer behaviour also has a role to play.ECBEconomic BulletinIssue 1 / 2015S 1STATISTICSCONTENTS1 External environment S22 Financial developments S33 Production and demand S74 Prices and costs S115 Money and credit S146 Fiscal developments S19FURTHER IN
