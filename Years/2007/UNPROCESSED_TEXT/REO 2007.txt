viiForeword This 
Regional Economic Outlook: Europe (REO: Europe)
 is the first in what is planned as a periodic 
publication of the European Department of the In
ternational Monetary Fund. The next issue of the 
REO: Europe
 is scheduled for April 2008, shortly after the IMF™s April 
World Economic Outlook(WEO). 
 Every 
REO: Europe
 will cover the economic outlook and examine one or more analytical topics. 
The outlook part is intended to complement the WEO by highlighting economic developments and 

policy implications that are especially relevant for Europe. This issue™s focus is on the implications of 

recent financial turbulence and the reforms need
ed to sustain growth over the medium term. With 
the spotlight on the financial sector, the analytic
al part of the report discusses ways to further 
strengthen financial systems in both adva
nced and emerging economies in Europe.  
 This 
REO: Europe was coordinated by the Regional Studies Division of the IMF™s European 
Department. It draws extensively on contributions 
from the staff of the European Department and 
has benefited from inputs and comments from sta
ff of the IMF™s Monetary and Capital Markets and 
Research Departments. The main authors of the report are Rudolfs Bems, Philip Schellekens, Man-

Keung Tang, Athanasios Vamvakidis, and Edda Zoli, under the general guidance of Luc Everaert. 
Pavel Lukyantsau, Dominique Raelison-Rajaobelina, and Thomas Walter provided research, 
administrative, and editorial assistance, respectively. Marina Primorac from the External Relations 
Department oversaw the produ
ction of the publication.

ixExecutive Summary Outlook: Through Financial Turbulence to Sustained Growth  Strong fundamentals should allow the European 
economy to weather the cu
rrent financial turbulence 
relatively well. If the turbulence recedes, the impact on growth should be manageable. A buoyant global 

economy, combined with generally sound macroeconom
ic policies and increasing trade and financial 
integration in Europe, have yielded a buoyant regional economy with clear growth dividends for 

advanced economies and convergence benefits for emerging Europe. Nonetheless, growth is set to ease 
in 2008 in nearly all countries.  
 Protracted credit market tightness constitutes a k
ey downside risk to this outlook, especially for 
advanced economies. While the broader financial system has continued to function well, money and 

credit markets remain tight. Direct exposure and the interconnection of money markets caused financial 

turbulence to spread quickly to advanced economies in Europe. Lack of information on exposures and 

difficulties in valuing assets triggered a reluctance to trade in money markets, causing difficulties for 
banks relying on short-term wholesale resources to 
fund long-term assets. A continuing tightness of 
credit would have downsides for the real economy. 
 Despite relatively high external vulnerabilities, emerging Europe has so far remained largely unscathed 
by the financial turbulence, owing to its limited 
reliance on interbank market
s and complex financial 
products. Nonetheless, risks for emerging Europe have also risen, especially for those countries that have 

been funding large current account imbalances with fo
reign bank borrowing. In this regard, the financial 
turbulence may herald a healthy correction to past exuberance, bringing risk spreads closer to 
fundamentals, improving credit discipline, and helping to reduce external imbalances in emerging 

countries. The unexpected uncertainty associated with unse
ttled credit markets has complicated policymakers™ 
task of steering their economies to
 maintain growth without overhe
ating, especially in advanced economies. While their response has been broadly effective so far, central banks will have to continue to 
stand ready to provide liquidity to deal with systemic 
risks. In the euro area and several other advanced 
economies, monetary policy has been appropriately kept on hold in view of the downside risks associated 

with the financial turmoil. Looking further forward, 
the baseline forecast presumes these risks to dissipate 
gradually, and a further tightening may then be requi
red. Such a stance would of course need to be 
reconsidered if the risks materialized and the slowdown became protracted. In the emerging economies, 

inflationary pressures and external vulnerabilities will then warrant further interest rate increases in the 

central scenario. In those cases where monetary policy 
tools are ineffective or unavailable, the tightening 
will need to be achieved through fiscal restraint. Strong banking supervision will be critical throughout 

emerging Europe.  
 Recent events have underscored the need for fina
ncial sector reform. They reveal that private and 
public prudential frameworks have not kept up with developments in financial innovation and will need 

to do a better job going forward. Moreover, the tend
ency of new financial products to exploit gaps in 
prudential frameworks can prove problematic and needs to be guarded against. As argued in the 

analytical part of this paper, financial innovation has been and will remain an important source of 

strengthened performance over the medium term and must be encouraged. At the same time, a balanced 
review of prudential arrangements, financial safety nets
, and crisis resolution mechanisms is necessary to 
strengthen their overall effectiveness.  
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
x Looking beyond the immediate turbulence, Europe faces major challenges if it is to sustain reasonably 
robust growth. To deal with expenditure pressures from population aging, fiscal consolidationŠbased on 

expenditure reductionŠneeds to return to a more ambitious track. For 
several advanced economies, this 
is also needed because deficits remain too high 
to deal comfortably with eventual downturns. In 
emerging Europe, more fiscal consolidation is desirable to mitigate convergence-related demand 
pressures and insure against risks posed by the rapidly rising indebtedness of the private sector. 
Consolidation, however, also needs to be aimed at and 
complemented by structural reforms to strengthen 
supply and deliver on the promise of income converge
nce, including measures to advance economic and 
financial integration. 
Analytical Focus: Strengthening Financial Systems 
 Rapid financial deepening, innovation, and financial integration have substantially transformed the 

financial landscape in Europe. Consumers and businesses are benefiting from an ever-widening range of 

financing and investment options. The benefits are part
icularly apparent in the rapid income convergence 
enjoyed by many countries in emerging Europe. But 
rapid financial innovation and integration engender 
risks, and, as the turbulence has brought home, adverse shocks tend to be swiftly transmitted across 

borders. So what should policymakers do? 
 Current turbulence notwithstanding, advanced economies still stand to reap considerable efficiency 
gains by further expanding the range of financial acti
vities offered by their financial systems (Part II, 
Chapter 1). Competitive and more diversified financial systems are better at distributing risk and 

allocating resources to sectors with high growth po
tential. The countries that have progressed most in 
exploiting the complementarities of bank- and market-based financing have benefited overall. In most 

economies, further reforms are needed to level the playing field for the various forms of financial 

intermediation and take advantage of their synergies.  
 But recent events warn that financial innovation can heighten risks stemming from gaps in prudential 
frameworks. Putting matters in perspective, though, 
all traditional forms of financial intermediation have 
gone through similar tests and bounced back: their benefits are no longer questioned. In response to the 

current turbulence, market participants and policymakers will need to develop safeguards to allow these 

benefits to accrue without incurring excessive risk. From this perspective, it will be important to improve 

risk assessment models, market and liquidity risk management, due diligence, and transparency regarding 
the loan origination process and counterparty risk exposure. 
 For the emerging economies, meanwhile, the prime challenge is to effectively manage rapid financial 
deepening in the context of convergence (Part II, Ch
apter 2). The blistering pace of credit growth and 
the rapid increase in private indebtedness in many of these economies have heightened risks and raised 

questions about sustainability. Policies have been unable to stem this tide, underscoring the importance 

of reducing vulnerabilities and building safety margins. These objectives can be achieved by removing 

fiscal and other distortions affecting bank lendin
g, improving the implementa
tion of prudential and 
supervisory measures, and promoting better disclosur
e and understanding of risks. Where convergence has been associated with large external imbalances, the medium-term challenge will be to turn these 
imbalances around without painful adjustment. This will
 require that resources flow without hindrance to 
productive investments, particularly in the tradables sector. To assist this process, policymakers will need 
to strengthen their financial systems and make labor and capital markets more flexible.  
Executive Summary
xi Building on recent progress, all economies in emerging Europe can reap important benefits from 
sustained development of their financial systems in terms of efficiency, risk diversification, and resilience 

in coping with possibly volatile external capital 
flows (Part II, Chapter 3). For EU members, the 
integration process provides a unique opportunity to expedite financial development, as harmonization 

requirements, competition pressure, and supervisory risks make further comprehensive reforms more 
compelling. The emerging economies outside the European Union should focus on reinforcing the 
foundations of financial development: low and stable inflation, good institutional quality, and the rule of 
law. Creating a well-functioning government securities
 market, establishing strong corporate governance 
and creditor rights protection, an
d promoting the emergence of institutional investors would also be 
beneficial.

Sustained Growth
3Outlook: Through Financial Turbulence to 
Sustained Growth 
 Strong underlying fundamentals should allow the 
European economy to weather the current financial market 

turbulence relatively well. If the turbulence recedes, the impact 
on growth should be manageable. Emerging Europe has so far 
remained largely unscathed by the financial market 

turbulence. Nonetheless, growth is set to ease in 2008 in 

nearly all of Europe. In addition, uncertainty and downside 

risks have increased, and protr
acted credit market tightening 
could push growth below the baseline. The immediate challenge 

for policymakers is to restore confidence in key financial 

markets, support real activity, and keep inflation low. More 

fundamentally, however, there is a continuing need to address 
vulnerabilities and sustain growth over the medium term, 
which requires further progress in fiscal consolidation, 

economic integration, and structural reforms.
*Strong Fundamentals Should Help Overcome Financial 
Turbulence Economic activity has remained strong in 2007, 
with the euro area expected to outpace the United 

States and the top-performing European emerging 

economies posting growth rates second only to

Outlook: Through Financial Turbulence to Sustained Growth 
5especially buoyant in the Baltic countries, several 
European Union (EU) member states in Central 
Europe, and the oil producers, notably Russia and 

Norway. Strong domestic demandŠparticularly 

investment, including buoyant construction 
activityŠhas combined with a favorable external 
environment to drive Europe™s growth in recent 

years. Wage moderation and labor market reforms 

in the European Union™s advanced economies 

have supported job creation, lowered 

unemployment, and increased participation. 

Inflation remains under control in the advanced 

economies, and is projected to average close to 

the 2 percent target of both the European Central 
Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England, but energy 
and food prices contributed to an uptick in 

September (Table 1). However, inflation remains 

well above this level in most emerging economies, 

especially those with pegged exchange rate 

regimes; in some cases, this reflects overheating.  
 Recent financial turbul
ence has dampened the 
near-term outlook. While growth was set to ease 

somewhat, most countries are now expected to 

see a more pronounced slowing in 2008, as 

discussed in the October 2007 WEO. The 

projected lower growth for the United States and 

the fallout from financial turbulence are expected 

to reduce growth temporarily in advanced 

European economies. The direct impact on 
emerging Europe is projected to be quite muted, 
but the slowdown is expected to foster the 

beginning of a gradual correction of the external 

imbalances and easing of the overheating 

pressures apparent in a number of these 

economies. The baseline forecast assumes a 

gradual resumption of normal financial market 

functioning and liquidity conditions over the 

coming months.  
 Direct exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage 
market and the interconnection of money markets 

caused the financial turbulence to spread quickly 

to the advanced economies of Europe (Box 1). 

Several European banks were exposed to the 
shock either directly, through their holdings, or 
indirectly, through off-
balance-sheet special investment vehicles (SIVs or conduits). These 

vehicles often had contingent credit lines with the 

banks and were receiving short-term financing by 

issuing commercial paper. When the subprime 

crisis hit, lack of information on related exposures 

and difficulties in valuing collateral triggered a 

general reluctance to trade in money markets. 
Reflecting the liquidity freeze, volatility in 
interbank money rates rose sharply (Figure 3). 

Liquidity problems were further aggravated by 

investors™ general retrenchment from asset-backed 
commercial paper (ABCP), which required banks 

to fund the underlying assets directly. 
 Money and credit markets in advanced 
economies are still returning to normal operating 

conditions, but the fallout for individual financial 

institutions has so far been contained. Stock prices

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
6Box 1. Why Was Europe Affected by the Collapse of the U.S. Subprime Mortgage 
Market?The recent financial market turbulence is unprecedented in a number of ways. In contrast with other 
regional or global economic crises in recent decades, it originated in advanced economies and has affected 
their financial marketsŠparticularly in EuropeŠmuch more than others, including emerging economies 
that are usually considered to be more vulnerable. It was the first test of structured finance and related credit 
derivatives and instruments traded globally. The shock drained liquidity in the usually highly liquid interbank 
money markets of several countries.  
The origin of the shock was a reassessment of subprime mortgage risk in the United States and its 
implications for complex derivatives pricing worldwide.
1 Several European banks exposed to the U.S. 
subprime mortgage market started reporting substantial in
creases in provisions for bad loans during the first 
half of 2007. Concerns about credit quality in the U.S. subprime real estate market in July and early August 
translated into concerns about asset-backed comm
ercial paper (ABCP), which was used to fund 
collateralized debt obligations. As a result, financial institutions began a retrenchment of their holdings of 
related assets.  
Several large European banks found themselves exposed to the shock, either directly as holders of ABCP or 
indirectly through conduits and struct
ured investment vehicles with si
milar holdings that had ensured open 
credit lines with banks.
2 The ABCP market came to a sudden stop and forced exposed banks to step in with 
funding, causing a liquidity squeeze in the global money market through the interbank market. Concerns that 
conduits would have to draw further on banks with which they had open credit lines and, in some cases, be 
forced to sell assets in a declining market followed. Se
ctions of the money and swap markets effectively shut 
down as transactions were refused owing to price uncertainty.  
Uncertainty about the size and scope of the losses has magnified the impact of the shock. Many conduits 
that were investing in subprime mortgage securities had deferred the risk assessment of the underlying long-
term assets to the rating agencies 
while receiving short-term funding using 
ABCP. As risk-averse investors in 
ABCP, most of which were money market funds, beca
me wary about their uncertain exposures to the 
subprime mortgage fallout, the market for ABCP dried up. With banks committed to providing liquidity to 
their conduits and suspect about the exposure of their competitors to ABCP conduits, confidence plunged, 
and liquidity in the interbank money market and the financial system tightened. Furthermore, banks that are 
exposed to further future rollover failures of ABCP have started building precautionary cash reserves, 
reducing market liquidity further. 
Retained liquidity and a ﬁwaitŒand-seeﬂ and ﬁflight-to-qualityﬂ approach 
by investors and banks have affected
 other asset classes, such as leveraged buyouts, which also depend on 
banks for funding.  
The problem was exacerbated in Europe by the reliance of many European conduits on U.S. dollar funding. 
Because U.S. banks were reluctant to
 provide liquidity to European borrowers with uncertain exposures, the 
shortage of U.S. dollar funding spilled over to the European money market. The problem was compounded 
by the reliance of many financial firms on the foreign exchange swaps market, which is intermediated in U.S. 
dollars.1 The October 2007 
Global Financial Stability Report
 (IMF, 2007a) contains an extensive 
discussion of the evolution of the 
financial turmoil and its policy implications.  2 ABCP vehicles (or conduits) are usually backed up by lines

bout 90 percent of them have 
access to bank credit lines for 100 percent of their assets.
Outlook: Through Financial Turbulence to Sustained Growth 
7of the banking sector in advanced economies 
suggest continuing uncertainty (Figure 4). Two 

German banks with direct exposure to subprime 

losses had to be bailed out, while the United 

Kingdom™s fifth-largest mortgage lender, which 
relied substantially on money market liquidity, faced 
a run on deposits that prompted an intervention by 

the authorities. Some banks and mortgage lenders in 

other European countries also felt the shock. But 

banks with large retail networks and diversified 

portfolios have not been greatly affected so far. A 

few large European banks have had to book losses, 

but the amounts, while sizable in absolute terms, 

have up to now been small relative to the banks™ 
balance sheets.  
 Remarkably, emerging Europe has so far 
weathered the turbulence well, despite  

vulnerabilities linked to fast credit growth and, in 

some cases, high external debt. In addition to 

prospects for continued rapid growth, other factors 
seem to have provided shelter from financial 
turbulence to date. With strong demand for prime 

loans in recent years limiting the need to seek profits 

in riskier assets, direct exposure to ABCP has been 

virtually nonexistent. Exposure to complex financial 

products has been substantially smaller than in 

advanced economies, interbank markets have been 

relatively thin, and, for some countries, the exchange 

rate has been playing a larger role in the 
transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Money 
market conditions initially tightened appreciably in a 

few countries, and floating currencies came under 

pressure, especially in Turkey, Hungary, and 

Romania. However, these tensions eased quickly, 

except in Russia, where difficulties of some 

medium-sized banks in obtaining liquidity lingered 

for some time, and Romania, where exchange rate 

pressures continued. Exchange rate peggers have so far been less affected than floaters. Stock markets 
initially fell sharply in several other countries, most 

notably Turkey and Poland, but have recovered 

since (Figure 5). However, external credit spreads 

have remained wider in most emerging economies, 

notably Serbia, Ukraine, and Croatia (Figure 6).

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
8Protracted Credit Market Tightening Would Add Downside 
Risk The turbulence in 
financial markets has 
heightened downside risks. Besides risks that have 
been around for some time, including a disorderly 
unwinding of global imbalances, developments in 

energy and commodity prices, and political uncer-

tainty in some parts of emerging Europe, a sustained 

deterioration in financial conditions may push the 

European economy below the baseline projections. 

Financial turbulence has also amplified the risk of a 

disruptive unwinding of global imbalances. Advanced economies appear to be vulnerable to 
confidence effects and credit tightness in particular. 

A sharper slowdown of the U.S. economy would 
dampen exports, but the effect would likely be 

relatively contained unless it were associated with a 

disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and a 
further sharp appreciation of the euro. More 
important, a lasting deterioration of business and consumer sentiment, which has been considerably 

dented by the financial turbulence (Figure 7), would 

weaken domestic demand. As regards credit 
tightness, corporate borrowing for investment and 

construction activity in the housing sector would be 

affected the most. In the latter case, countries that 

experienced rapid house price increases (notably 

Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, 
and the United Kingdom) would be most exposed. Together with reduced profitability, the drying up of 

demand for securitized assets could induce an 
expansion of bank balance sheets and strain capital 

positions. Such a scenario could lead to a sustained 

tightening of credit conditions, with a dampening 

impact on domestic demand.  
 Emerging Europe could be affected through two 
channels: an overall increase in risk aversion and a 

slowing of foreign demand. A prolonged 

deterioration in financial conditions in mature 
markets could lead to a cutback in lending to 

emerging markets, especially if parent banks reassess 

their exposures to subsidiaries in emerging Europe. 

Mortgage and housing markets would be the first to 
feel the impact of tight credit conditions, as several 
emerging economies in Europe have experienced 

housing booms in recent years, sometimes fueled by 

substantial foreign borrowing. Even so, a broader 

rise in risk premiums would need to be substantial 
to significantly increase the debt-service burden in 
most emerging European economies: according to 

IMF staff estimates, a 100-basis-point increase in 

interest rates (well in excess of that experienced so 

far) would raise external debt service on average by 

0.4 percent of GDP. However, countries with high 

levels of private sector debt (most of which is at 

variable interest rates), such as Bulgaria, Croatia, 

Estonia, Hungary, and Latvia, would be more 
affected. As to the second channel, a growth 
slowdown in the advanced European economies 

would hit exports in emerging Europe, hurting 

short-term growth prospect
s. In combination, the 
operation of both channels could pose particular 

adjustment problems for countries that have been 

running large current account deficits (including the 

Baltics and several economies in Southeastern 

Europe). On the positive side, financial turbulence may 
well herald a healthy correction from past 

exuberance, thus strengthening the foundations for 

future growth. Asset markets tend to overreact, 

especially when opacity of information is a key 

factor, as is the case now. While some markets 
remain under stress, others have continued to

Outlook: Through Financial Turbulence to Sustained Growth 
9function well, suggesting that the impact on the real 
economy could be transitory. The market turbulence 

may set in motion a process that brings risk spreads 

and asset prices closer to fundamentals, improves 

credit discipline, and gradually diminishes external 
imbalances in emerging economies.  
Policymakers Are Facing 
Unexpected Uncertainty 
 Financial turbulence has complicated 
policymakers™ task of steering their economies to 

maintain growth without overheating, especially in 

advanced European economies. Monetary policy 

faces a delicate balancin
g act of responding to liquidity disruptions, while guarding against the 
buildup of inflationary pressures. In addition, 

lessons will need to be drawn from the current 

episode of turbulence for financial sector policies. 

Meanwhile, in several emerging economies in 

Europe, dealing with inflationary pressures and 

external vulnerabilities remains the dominant policy 

concern.   Central bank action seems to have been effective 
so far in calming market sentiment, but some money 

markets remain tight. While overnight money 

market rates were reduced following the central 

bank interventions, one- to three-month funding 

rates are taking longer to normalize (Figure 3). Most 

major European central banks have responded to 
the financial turbulence by providing liquidity 
support to the money market and by lending against 

riskier collateral, including mortgages. The ECB has 

injected large amounts of liquidity in the interbank 

money market a number of times since early August. 

The Bank of England offered resources beyond 

one-month maturity after the run on deposits of a 

mortgage bank in late September, though no bids 

were received for these funds. The Bank of Russia 
provided liquidity during the shock to support a 
return to smooth function
ing of the money market.   The European central banks are also reappraising 
their monetary policy stance in view of the likely 

impact of tightened credit conditions on growth and 

inflation. The ECB kept its policy rate constant in 
early September, although it had earlier signaled its 
intention to hike rates. The Central Bank of Turkey 

brought forward a cut in its policy rate to 

September, noting that the turbulence would lessen 

external and domestic demand. In Hungary, 
domestic factors induced the central bank to lower 
interest rates. However, the central banks of 
Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland increased interest 

rates in response to continued strong domestic 

demand and emerging capacity constraints. Similarly, 

concerns about inflationary pressures prompted the 

central banks of Poland and the Czech Republic to 

raise interest rates at the end of August.  
 In dealing with the current uncertainty, central 
banks will need to continue to stand ready to 

provide liquidity support to money markets as 

needed, while keeping interest rate policy focused on 

inflation and the real economy. Liquidity support 

should be designed to ensure a smooth functioning 

of money markets, while problems at individual 
institutions need to be resolved in ways that 
minimize the risk of moral hazard. In the euro area, 

monetary policy has been appropriately kept on hold 

in view of the downside risks associated with the 

financial turmoil. Looking further forward, the 

baseline forecast presumes these risks to dissipate 
gradually, and a further tightening may then be 

required. Such a stance would of course need to be 

reconsidered if the risks materialized and the 
slowdown became protracted. In the United 
Kingdom and other advanced European economies, 
similar considerations will need to guide monetary 

authorities.  
 In terms of financial sector policies, recent events 
indicate that private and public prudential 
frameworks have not kept up with developments in 
financial innovationŠthey will need to do better 

going forward. As argued in the analytical part of 

this REO, financial innovation is an important 

source of strengthened performance over the 

medium term, and as such must be allowedŠand 

indeed encouragedŠto flourish. But new financial 

products often exploit gaps in existing prudential 

arrangements that can prove problematic. As 
discussed in the October 2007 
Global Financial REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
10Stability Report, a balanced review of these 
arrangements is therefore necessary, focused on 

improving transparency and strengthening the 

effectiveness of financial regulation. In addition, the 

recent market turmoil has drawn attention to the 
need to secure effective financial safety nets and 
swift crisis resolution mechanisms.  
 In the Baltics and Southeastern Europe, 
meanwhile, policymakers will need to focus on 

steering the economy toward a soft landing. 

Countries with floating exchange rates could further 
raise interest rates as needed to stem inflationary 
pressures. Fiscal restraint will have to contribute, 

too, and will be crucial for countries with fixed 

exchange rates (e.g., the Baltics and Bulgaria) or 

tightly managed floats (e.g., Croatia). Throughout 

emerging Europe, strong bank supervision will be 

critical to manage rapidly expanding balance sheets.  Reforms Are Key to Sustaining 
Growth 
 To reduce vulnerabilities and raise medium-term 
growth prospects, Europe needs to continue fiscal 
adjustment and pursue structural reforms 

proactively. Recent fiscal consolidation has made 

inroads, but deficits remain too large in many 

advanced and emerging economies to deal 

comfortably with shocks and secure sustainability, in 

light of expenditure pressures from population 
aging. Structural reforms have paid off but, on 
average, Europe™s advanced economies are still 

failing to make notable progress in closing the 

transatlantic divide in per capita GDP. Yet Europe™s 

most successful performers have demonstrated that 

comprehensive reforms pay clear dividends. 

Emerging Europe has made great strides compared 

with the advanced economies, but viewed over a 

decade it is not doing as well as better-performing 
peers, notably in Asia, and its vulnerabilities are 
higher. For Europe™s emerging economies, it will be 

essential to deliver the higher growth potential that 

investors are anticipating.  
Fiscal Policy Needs to Return to the 
Consolidation Track  Fiscal consolidation, which had proceeded at a 
reasonable pace in 2004Œ06, is expected to stall 

during 2007Œ08 (Figure 8 and Table 2). In spite of 

the favorable outlook, fiscal policies are set to 

loosen in half of the European countries, and the 

pace of fiscal consolidation to slow in most of the 

rest. For the most part, these developments reflect 

policies that have used cyclically driven and, 
therefore, temporary revenues to slacken the pace of 
adjustment or raise spending. As a result, fiscal 

balances already deteriorated in 2006 in several cases 
(Serbia, Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak 

Republic). In the euro area, fiscal consolidation has 

continued in 2007 but is projected to stop in most 

countries in 2008. France and Italy, for example, are 

moving ahead with tax cuts and postponing further 

consolidation. Norway and Russia are unwinding 
large, oil-driven surpluses, reversing part of the 
earlier consolidation. At the other end of the 

spectrum, Hungary, which has had Europe™s largest 

deficit, is expected to deliver significant fiscal 

adjustment.  Figure 8. European Regions: General Government

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
12There are compelling reasons to pursue fiscal 
consolidation: 
More fiscal room would become available to 
manage possible significant downturns, which 
is especially relevant in several advanced 
economies. In the euro area, the commitment 
to reach specific medium-term objectives by 
2010 is welcome, but countries that are 

significantly short of these objectives need to 
step up the pace of adjustment beyond current 
intentions. 
Convergence-related demand pressures in emerging Europe would be mitigated. Despite 

efforts to tighten monetary conditions, they 
have been loose in a number of emerging 
economies because monetary policy has been 
overwhelmed by large capital inflows in many 
countries, particularly those where its use is 
restricted by pegged exchange rate regimes 
(Figure 9). As a result, monetary tightening has 

been providing little help in curbing domestic 
credit growth (see Figure 10). Fiscal restraint 
needs to go beyond mere cyclical stabilization 
to offset exuberant private sector demand. In 
this context, policymakers should also remove 

tax-induced distortions that have contributed 
to the blistering pace of credit growth. 
Insurance would be provided against the risks 
posed by the external vulnerabilities that the 

private sector has generated. While Europe™s 

overall external current account is close to 
balance, this masks an unprecedented dispersion, with large deficits in the Baltics, 
Greece, Portugal, Spain, and most emerging 
economies in Southeastern Europe (Figure 11 
and Table 2). Foreign bank borrowing has 
funded a large share of these deficits, boosting 

external indebtedness in several countries to 
levels much higher than in emerging 
economies outside Europe (Figure 12). Given 
the risk of external shocks, whether unrelated 
to country fundamentals or otherwise, 

prudence argues for building up safety 
margins, with increases in public savings 
mitigating the increases in private dissaving. 
Fiscal sustainability concerns in some emerging 
economies (e.g., the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
and Poland) and spending pressures from 
aging populations throughout Europe would 
be addressed. Given the already heavy tax 
burden in most countries, spending reforms 

seem to be the only option for consolidation. 
In many countries, further reforms of social security and health care systems seem 
necessary to establish the long-term fiscal 
sustainability of these systems.  
 With the baseline prospects still favorable for 
advanced economies and buoyant for emerging 

Europe, proceeding with fiscal consolidation 

within a framework that allows full play to the 

automatic stabilizers is unlikely to dent the short-

term outlook and is well worth the strengthened 

medium-term prospects it would open. 
Economic Integration and Structural ReformŠPaths to a Strengthened Performance Europe stands to gain considerably from 
continuing economic inte
gration. Although the 
recent financial turbulence underscores that 

financial integration also comes with some perils, 

there is little doubt that Europe has benefited 

greatly from the ongoing multifaceted process of 
economic integration (Box 2). The main channels 
have been trade integration, a long-standing 

pedigree of the European Union; financial 

integration, which has taken off over the past 

decade; and cross-border labor migration, which is 

also on the rise. There is strong evidence that 

economic integration has improved living 

standards in Europe. Emerging Europe has 

become Europe™s fastest-growing market, 
contributing on some estimates between 0.2 and 
0.4 percent annually to advanced economies™ 

growth in recent years. And financial integration 

has been key for the income convergence of 
Outlook: Through Financial Turbulence to Sustained Growth 
13emerging Europe (Part II, Chapter 2). With 
integration far from complete for most emerging 

economies, substantial economic benefits still lie 

ahead. 
 To fully reap the benefi
ts from integration and 
reduce vulnerabilities to shocks, Europe needs to 
push ahead with structural reforms, building on 
recent progress. Europe™s structural rigidities 
remain its Achilles™ heel, inhibiting growth and 

making adjustment to shocks protracted and 

difficult. Germany™s recovery took hold only after 

five years of slow growth and significant reforms, 

while Portugal has yet to rekindle its convergence 
bid, which faltered in the late 1990s. Figure 9. Emerging Europe: Monetary Conditions,

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
14Box 2. Europe™s Economic Integration 
Although the foundations of Europe™s economic integration were put in place by the Treaty of Rome in 
1957, the collapse of communism and EU enlargement provided a big push, increasingly encompassing 
countries that are not (yet) members of the European Union.
1 Already much more advanced than regional 
integration in the rest of the world, economic integration within Europe has accelerated in recent years, 
underpinning improved economic performance. As documented below, Europe™s economic integration is 
manifested in three areas: intra-Eu
ropean trade, financial market integration, and labor market integration.  
Intra-European Trade Both in levels and as a share of GDP, European 
economies trade more with each other than do 
economies within all other continents. Moreover, 
trade within Europe has been expanding rapidly 
since the 2004 EU enlargement, although not as 
fast as in Asia (first figure).
2The expansion in 
European trade has not been at the expense of 
trade with the rest of the world, as the openness 
of the European economy has kept increasing: 
the ratio of exports plus imports to GDP has 
risen from 48 percent in the early 1990s to 
82 percent today. 
Most intra-European trade is among developed 
economies, but the share of trade with emerging 
Europe has been increasing (table). The advanced 
European economies sent 11 percent of their 
exports to emerging Europe in 2006, compared 
with 8 percent in 2000. Moreover, their exports 
to emerging Europe have been growing by 
double the rate of their exports to each other in 
the past two years.  
Trade integration in Europe has led to faster economic growth. Exports to emerging economies in Europe 
contributed 0.6 percent to the growth of advanced European economies in 2006, compared with just 0.1 
percent at the beginning of the decade. Using an empirical growth model measuring cross-border spillover 
effects, the acceleration of growth in emerging Europe 
in the past five years (by 3.8 percentage points) and 
the increase of the share of imports coming from advanced European economies (by 3 percentage points) 
have raised annual growth in advanced European economies between 0.2 and 0.4 percent, keeping 
everything else constant.
3Estimates from the literature on the links between trade and growth, and
1A thorough discussion of the history of Europe™s ec
onomic integration is provided in Eichengreen (2007). 
2States within the United States trade more with each ot
her than European countries do
, even within the European Union, but this is an improper comp
arison, because countries 
tend to trade more within
 than across borders. 
Furthermore, free trade is historically much more recent within Europe than within the United States, and trade

4Financial Market Integration
5European financial market integration has progressed significantly in recent years with emerging Europe 
integrating faster than the rest of Europe. In a novel
 approach, integration is defined here using price-based 
rather than volume-based measures. An imperfectly integrated region undergoing financial integration is 
expected to experience convergence of the cost of capital across countries. Empirical analysis indeed finds 
strong evidence of a declining trend in cross-country dispersion of equity premiums (taken as a proxy for 
firms™ cost of capital) across advanced and emerging economies (second figure). Moreover, this process is 
faster in emerging Europe than in other countries included in the study, thereby significantly contributing to 
convergence within the region.
6In addition, the analysis suggests that Europe has 
been experiencing a virtuous circle wherein 
progress in financial integration and improved 
real prospects have been
 mutually reinforcing. Measures of a country™s speed of integration 
(proxied by the distance 
of a country™s cost of 
capital from the group average) predict 
subsequent increases in its risk-adjusted growth 
opportunities (proxied by the ratio of market 
price-to-earnings ratios to their volatility). 
Similarly, improvements in risk-adjusted growth 
opportunities predict future advances in financial 
integration. Adjusting for risk is especially 
important when looking at welfare implications. 
Countries with high, but very uncertain, growth 
prospects are unlikely to be as well off as 
countries with a more favorable risk-return trade-
off. From this perspective it is reassuring that 
most emerging countries in the sample are 
experiencing an improvement, though a few 
seem to have increased growth at the expense of 
a proportional increase in risk. 
Labor Market Integration  
Labor migration within Europe has increased 
considerably since the early 1990s. As a share of 
population, net migration to the euro area has 
risen to 82 percent of that to the United States,

7 Although bilateral flow data are not available, anecdotal 
evidence suggests that most labor movement within Europe is from emerging to advanced economies. 
Furthermore, the recent waves in net migration in Europe coincide with the liberalization of the Eastern 
European economies in the early 1990s and the EU enlargement process in recent years. Indeed, according 
to Article 18 of the Treaty of Rome, all EU citizens have the right to apply to work in any position in the 
union (including national civil services, with the exception of sensitive positions), although after a short 
transition period in some cases for the new members. 
The impact of migration on growth is an open empirical question, but seems to be positive in advanced 
European economies. According to IMF staff calculations, migration explains 8 percent of the increase in 
the euro area™s labor force since the beginning of this decade, which by itself is expected to lead to faster 
growth. The fact that unemployment has been falling at the same time suggests that imported labor is not 
replacing domestic labor. Therefore, labor migration may explain part of Europe™s fast economic growth in 
recent years, although more research 
is needed to determine how much.  
The economic impact of migration on emerging Europe, which is a net supplier, is a more complex issue. 
Both pull and push factorsŠhigh demand for cheap labor from receiving economies and a difficult business 
environment in supplying economiesŠexplain large labor outflows relative to population size in some 
emerging European economies. Although these countries benefit from significant remittances, human 
capital drain is a concern for their long-term growth 
prospects. However, structural reforms that improve 
the business environment could limit or even partly reverse the outflows. 
7Labor movements within the United States
 are much larger than within Europe 
or even within the European Union. 
However, the comparisons in this box refer to migration to the United States ra
ther than within labor reallocations.
Structural reforms have progressed during recent years in most European economies, but gaps with 

the rest of the world remain large for most 

countries (Table 3). Labor market reforms in 

advanced economies have increased employment 

rates, and the recent reinvigoration of the 
European Union™s Lisbon Agenda is encouraging. 
France™s ambitious structural reform plan is also 
welcome. But further steps are needed to narrow 

tax wedges and relax excessively strict 

employment protection regulations, and to 

increase contestability in the market for services, by implementing the EU Services Directive.
2Financial integration and further reforms of 

financial systems (Part II, Chapter 1) will also be 

essential.______2 The Services Directive aims at creating a free market for 
services within the European Union.

Outlook: Through Financial Turbulence to Sustained Growth 
17 With the pace and sustainability of convergence 
at stake, emerging Europe will need to push ahead 

with structural reforms. Although progress in recent 

years has been significant, this was from a low 

starting point in most cases. The Baltic countries are 
outliers, with structural reforms progressing well 
beyond what has been seen even in advanced 

economies. But these economies, together with 

others in the region, also feature relatively vulnerable 

external positions, and structural reforms aimed at 

strengthening contestability in the domestic 

economy are a major avenue toward strengthening 

the tradable goods and services sector and 

sustainability.  Economic transition in
 Central Europe has also 
progressed, improving competition and increasing 

potential growth, but an 
element of post-accession reform fatigue, easily available foreign financing, and 

expectations in some cases that eventual euro 

adoption will shield the economy from external 
shocks seem to have weakened the reform drive.
3______3 For recent empirical evidence, see Vamvakidis (2007). 
The challenge now is to move beyond the minimum 
standards prescribed by the EU 
acquis,4 and focus on 
strengthening productivity and transparency, 

including by improving the business environment 

and strengthening financial systems (Part II, 
Chapters 2 and 3).   The countries in Southeastern Europe and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) have 

lagged behind and will need to step up the pace.
5There is still significant room for reforms to reduce 

the role of the state in th
e economy, increase labor 
market flexibility, reduce red tape, progress with 
judiciary reform, and, in a number of countries, 

complete land registries.6 Although preparation to 
join the European Union in some cases will lead to 

reforms in these areas, more ambitious steps will be 

needed for these countries to be able to compete 

successfully within the European Union.

Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine.

could increase potential growth substantially in Croatia (see 
Moore and Vamvakidis, 2007). 
PART II 
Analytical Focus:Strengthening Financial Systems 
21Analytical Focus: Strengthening Financial 
Systems Following a period of sustained progress in financial 
deepening, innovation, and integration, turbulence has 

recently been testing Europe™s financial systems. The 

transformation of these systems has generally been beneficial, 

but financial sector efficiency still has considerable upward 
potential, and new policy challenges and risks have 
surfaced. Against this background, strengthening financial 
systems has become more important than ever. Each of the 

following chapters focuses on a priority area of reform: 

advanced economies need to tune up the efficiency and 

resilience of financial systems; converging economies in 

emerging Europe need to manage rapid financial deepening; 

and all emerging economies need to sustain development of 

their financial systems.  
 While much attention has been paid recently to 
the speed of financial deepening in emerging 

economies and its attendant risks, the financial 

systems of advanced economies have undergone a 

similar expansion already since the mid-1990s, 

and, as it turned out, not without risk (Figure 13). 

Clearly, common factors have been at work, such 

as the low-interest-rate environment and the search for yield. In the process, households have 
gained greater access to financial resources across 

Europe, especially through mortgage lending. The 

corporate sector too has rapidly increased its use 
of external financing in the form of credit and 

securities, and has done so more in advanced than 

in emerging economies. 
 Financial innovation has been transforming the 
face of intermediation (Figure 14). Derivatives, 

structured finance, and securitization products 

have proliferated, allowing a broader menu of 

risk-return choices and altering the distribution of 

risks. In advanced economies, banks have 

increasingly embraced these innovations, 

producing synergies between bank- and market-
based intermediation. In emerging economies, banks are expected to remain focused on their 

traditional intermediation function, but 
consolidation triggered by foreign bank 
penetration may quickly lead to the adoption of 

new products as well.  
 At the same time, financial integration in 
Europe has been proceeding at a sustained pace. 
The rising scale and persistence of cross-border 

capital flows have allowed current account deficits 

(and surpluses) to be larger and sustained for 

much longer than previously thought possible.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
22Moreover, gross holdings of assets and liabilities 
across borders have expanded even faster than net 

flows (Figure 15), with continuing cross-border 

consolidation and expansion of the banking 

system playing a key role.  
 The dynamic evolution of the financial system 
is generally having positive effects. Better access 

of households to the financial system is welfare 
improving, and allows a greater diversification and 

sharing of risk. Effective financial intermediation 

fosters efficient resource allocation and speeds its 
reallocation across sectors. And financial 
integration exports technology and skills and 

contributes to the better management of risks and 

lower macroeconomic volatility. However, 

benefits have not been distributed uniformly, 

reflecting the uneven state of development of 

financial systems across Europe and their still-

limited cross-border integration. Hence, more 

flexible and more integrated financial services 
sectors could appreciably boost productivity in 
Europe.7  In addition, as brought home by the recent 

subprime mortgage turbulence, risks need to be 

well managed to reap the benefits of financial 

innovation. Even with less sophistication, financial 
systems may exacerbate rigidities and distortions, and raise the costs of policy mistakes. And 

increasing financial integration may propagate 

external shocks more strongly and quickly across 

borders. Against this background, to enjoy the benefits 
of financial development without incurring 
excessive risk, advanced and emerging economies 

in Europe need to further strengthen their 

financial systems. Recognizing country differences 

in the level of financial development, the 

following chapters highlight three priority items 

on the reform agenda: 
Chapter 1, ﬁTuning the Financial Systems of Advanced Economies,ﬂ examines what is

needed for advanced economies to better 

exploit their financial depth for greater 
efficiency while safeguarding the resilience of 
the financial system. It looks at the economic 

benefits of financial systems that offer a wider 
range of financing options and discusses the 
reforms needed to move financial systems in 
that direction. At the same time, it identifies 
key risks posed by increasing financial 
sophistication and the required policy 
response.Chapter 2, ﬁManaging Rapid Financial 
Deepening in Emerging Europe,ﬂ focuses on 
how finance has been contributing to the 

economic convergence of emerging economies and which aspects of the financial system 
affect the sustainability of this process. It 
identifies financial sector policies to safely 
manage the boom associated with convergence 
and prepare emerging economies for a smooth 
reallocation of productive resources to the 

tradable sector.  Chapter 3, ﬁSustaining Financial Development 
in Emerging Europe,ﬂ takes stock of the 
financial system in emerging economies, 
identifies the factors that contribute to 

financial development, and lays out the 
unfinished policy agenda. It complements the 
chapter that precedes it, with many of its 
policy recommendations also pertinent for 
making rapid financial deepening a success.

231.  Tuning the Financial Systems of Advanced 
Economies Though Europe has made great strides in financial 
innovation and integration, many advanced European 

economies still need to level the playing field for the various 
forms of financial intermediation. Competitive and more 
diversified financial systems are better at distributing risk 

and identifying and supporting industries with high growth 

potential. These systems allow the complementarities of 

bank- and market-based financing to be fully exploited. At 

the same time, as the recent financial market turbulence 
underscores, both private and public prudential frameworks 

need to keep up with financial innovation if the benefits are 

to be reaped without incurring excessive risks. To secure the 
resilience of financial systems in advanced economies, it will 
be important to improve the management of market and 

liquidity risk, implement more advanced risk assessment 

models, and increase transparency of underwriting 
standards and counterparty risk exposures.
*Overview Financial systems in advanced European 

economies have been undergoing an unmistakable 

transformation. No longer is the European 

financial landscape dominated by a handful of 

large banks wielding considerable monopolistic 

power. Instead, competition among banks has 

been intensifying, and banks have been engaging 

in a wider variety of business than only traditional 
lending. Meanwhile, capital markets have been 
gaining importance, both as a source of funding 

and as a distributor of risks. And nonbank finan-

cial institutions have been rapidly emerging as 

another key intermediary of financial resources. As 

another sign of growing sophistication, the various 

forms of intermediation have also become less 

segmented, andŠthrough an increasing use of 
______Note: The main author of this chapter is Man-Keung Tang. 
The underpinning analytical work is presented in Tang (2007).innovative financial instrumentsŠcomplementary 
relationships among them have been 

strengthening. But, as the financial turbulence triggered by the 
meltdown of the U.S. subprime mortgage market 

has brought home, financial innovation comes 

with risks. Specifically, financial innovation often 

exploits interstices in existing prudential 

arrangements that can prove problematic. 
Moreover, in the context of financial 
globalization, turbulence spreads swiftly around 

the globe, sparing few countries from its adverse 

effects on confidence and real economic activity.  
 While it may be tempting for policymakers to 
try to slow financial innovation in view of such 
risks, a more productive policy approach would be 
to adopt reforms that simultaneously boost the 

efficiency of the financial system and tackle its 

vulnerabilities. Therefore, it will be important to 

clearly identify the benefits and causes of risks 

associated with a more sophisticated financial 

system before rushing to tighten regulation. In this 

respect, the initial reacti
on to the recent turbu-lence is encouraging, indicating a willingness by 

policymakers to preserve th
e benefits of financial 
innovation while confronting the prudential 
vulnerabilities. The benefits of stronger competition, greater 
diversity, and closer integration among different 

intermediaries in the European financial systems 

are becoming increasingly evident. Households 
and firms enjoy a greatly expanded set of invest-
ment and borrowing options at a significantly 

lower cost, thanks to stronger competition and 

better risk distribution. Empirical analyses suggest 

that the considerable financial depth of advanced 

European economies is more effectively trans-

formed into economic gains when the financial 

systems are more sophisticated.  
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
24 However, despite much progress made to date, 
European financial systems can still become far 

more efficient. The substantial remaining 

obstacles are restricting the full play of 

competitive forces and stunting the development 
of financing channels. Hence, the directly 
measured economic contribution of the financial 

sector to growth in advanced Europe has been 
lagging, and there is considerable scope to further 

strengthen this sector™s role in mobilizing 

resources to productive use. Lower productivity 

growth of the financial sector accounted for about 

half of the economy-wide productivity growth gap 

between the euro area and the United States during 1996Œ2003.  At the same time, the recent financial market 
turbulence has helped pinpoint weaknesses and 

provide some preliminary lessons to help buttress 

the prudential foundation of the more market-

based financial systems. In general, the increasing 
sophistication and complexity of financial 
transactions should be accompanied by an 

upgrading of private and public prudential 

frameworks. Recent events
 further highlight the 
need for better management of market and 

liquidity risk, upgrading of risk assessment models 

and due diligence, and greater transparency 

regarding the loan origination process and 

counterparty risk. Supervisory capacity may need to be boosted and the effectiveness of crisis 
management reviewed.8Evolution of Financial Systems 
 While starting points and speed of evolution 
differ, financial systems in advanced European economies have generally been moving toward 

stronger competition, greater diversity of financial 

activities, and closer integration among different 

intermediaries.  
______8 For further details see International Monetary Fund (2007a).  The financial index developed in the September 

2006 WEO9 provides one useful summary look at 
the composition of the financial systems in 

advanced Europe and their recent changes 

(Figure 16). In the remainder of this chapter, a 
higher score on the financial index will be 
described as a higher degree of sophistication of 

financial systems. The index quantitatively 

captures (1) the reliance of the system on 

traditional bank lending and the degree of 

competition among banks, (2) the extent of 

development of capital markets, and (3) the degree 

of new financial intermediationŠincluding the 

prevalence of nonbank financial institutions and 
use of financial innovations. Nearly all advanced 
economies have made progress on all three fronts 

covered by the index. But the landscape remains 

uneven across Europe. 
 Competition and diversity of intermediation 
have increased. Competition in bank lending has 
strengthened, as illustrated by narrowing interest 
spreads (lending minus money market rates) ______9 ﬁHow Do Financial System

25(Figure 17). The amount of funds under 
management by various nonbank financial 

institutions (e.g., insurance companies, pension 
funds, and investment funds) has risen 
substantially (Figure 18). Partly reflecting this rise, 

stock markets have gained in liquidity (Figure 19), 

and debt securities have increasingly become a 

potent funding source (Figure 20).  
 At the same time, banks have become more 
integrated with markets and continue to play a 
prominent role in the financial system. While 

competition for household savings from nonbank 
financial institutions has increased, the banks™ 
practice of more intensely sourcing funds from 

other intermediaries through the wholesale 
markets allows them to expand without being 
constrained by the amount of deposits they 

attract. Various off-balance-sheet activities, such 

as sales of securitized bank loans to the market 

and trading of derivatives, have also been 

increasingly pursued by banks. In general, such 

activities have decreased the segmentation of 

banks, markets, and nonbank financial

26intermediaries, enabling funds and risks to be 
more flexibly transferred.10 Traditional relationship-based lending 

continues to be highly relevant even though the 
changing nature of intermediation and widening 

range of lenders and financing options have 

reduced its dominance. The main advantage of 

relationship-based lendingŠfacilitating flows of 

finance in cases where there is serious information 

asymmetryŠappears to remain a key dimension in 

the evolving financial systems. In particular, a 
study of Italian firms shows that the financing of 
small enterprises, which tends to be opaque and 

heavily reliant on relationship-based loans for 

funds, has not been significantly affected by the 

rapid increase in sophistication of the Italian 

financial system (Box 3).  
Drivers of Change  The evolution of Europe™s financial systems 

has been driven in good part by domestic financial 

sector reforms. Large-scale privatization and 

deregulation of the banking sector in the 1980s 

and 1990s have increased competition and 

efficiency. Similarly, the substantial tightening of 

stock-listing requirements and corporate 

governance regulations has raised corporate 
disclosure standards and increased protection of 
investors from frauds, thus rendering equity more 
attractive. 
 Advances in information and communication 
technology have also contributed to this 

evolution. For instance, more timely availability 

and easier processing of borrower credit records 
encourage open competition among banks for 
potential borrowers (Petersen and Rajan, 2000), 

while increased access to the Internet and the 
proliferation of web-based trading channels 

promote wider and deeper investor participation ______10 In other words, the number of times savings are 
intermediated (ﬁchange handsﬂ) on their way to the end 

borrowers has increased, and the possibility of slicing and 
bundling risks in ways that 
better cater to different 
intermediaries and investors has expanded. 
in the stock markets (Choi, Laibson, and Metrick, 
2002). Financial integrationŠhastened by the 
harmonization of financial sector regulations and 

the adoption of a single currency among the euro 

area countriesŠmay have been the most 

important factor underlying the transformation of 

the financial system (Decressin, Faruqee, and 

Fonteyne, 2007): 
The lowering of barriers to integration of 
European banking has encouraged foreign entry and strengthened the contestability of the 
domestic banking sectors, prompting banks to 
expand into various off-balance-sheet activities 

(e.g., securitization, derivatives trading, and sale 
of risk management services). Moreover, the 
broadening of the client base across borders 
encourages banks to grow and benefit from 
economies of scale. The ensuing 

consolidations have further fostered banks™ 
capacities to engage in market transactions. 
Integration across stock exchanges has 
promoted capital market development. In particular, the mergers and joint ventures of 

several European stock exchanges, most 
notably Euronext,11 have standardized the 
trading platforms and lowered market 
fragmentation, thereby reducing cross-border 
stock trading costs and improving market 

liquidity (McAndrews and Stefanadis, 2002). Quality of the Financial System 
Matters As discussed, the evolution of the European 
financial systems has led to significant changes in 

the way finance is intermediated. Why are such 
changes important to the wider economy?______11 OMX Nordic Exchange, which consolidates exchanges in

Tuning the Financial Systems of Advanced Economies 
27Box 3. Continued Relevance of Relationship-Based Lending in an Evolving Financial System
As financial systems evolve, competition among banks and the diversity of financial intermediation increase, 
leading to a decline in the dominance of relationship-based lending. The expansion of borrowing alternatives 
benefits relatively transparent firms, as they get acce
ss to more competitively priced finance and become less 
vulnerable to the supply of funds from any one single lender.  
However, an examination of the financing of Italian firms indicates that relationship-based bank lending 
appears to remain important where its main advant
age counts most. Long-term interactions underlying 
relationship-based lending allow the lender to more 
effectively gather information about the borrower and 
thus facilitate flows of finance even in cases in which the borrower generates little publicly available 
information. Such mitigation of information asymmetry associated with opaque firms represents the main 
advantage of relationship-based lending. The study 
presented here, focusing on small enterprisesŠwhich 
tend to be opaque and rely heavily on loans from local banksŠin Italy shows that their access to funds has 
not been significantly affected over the past 10 year
s, suggesting that the main advantage of relationship-
based lending remains relevant even as the financial system is becoming increasingly sophisticated. 
Italy is chosen for the case study for two main reasons. First, the transformation of its financial system has 
been one of the most rapid among the advanced economies (according to the September 2006 WEO™s 
financial index). Therefore, any effect of the change in the financial system on the financing of the major 
beneficiaries of relationship-based lending should be most readily detectable in Italy™s data. Second, small 
enterprises make up a large part of the corporate universe in Italy. Their significant representation should 
provide more confidence in the precision of the empirical results. 
The empirical analysis examines the level of leverage of small enterprises (relative to larger enterprises) as a 
function of the financial system™s sophisticationŠof which a measure is constructed for each year of the 
sample period using the methodology for the September 2006 WEO™s financial indexŠcontrolling for 
fundamental factors found in the literature to be important determinants of the equilibrium leverage.
1In 
addition to the countrywide measure of the financial system, regional variation in the breadth of choice of 
lenders is measured as the number of lenders per firm in the region. Firm-level data used in the analysis 
cover more than 44,000 firms between 1995 and 2004.
2The sample includes small firms (with fewer than 50 
employees), but excludes micro 
firms.
3Regression results suggest that the 
increase in financial sophistication 
during the sample periodŠ
measured either for the country as 
a whole or across regionsŠdoes 
not significantly affect the 
financing of small firms (table). 
Although the positive effect of 
increasing financial sophistication 
on the equilibrium level of leverage seems to be lower for small firms (negative coefficient estimate on the 
interaction term), the differential effect is far from stat
istically significant. The results for all firms indicate 
that the increase in financial sophistication has a small positive effect on the equilibrium level of leverage.

28Theory 
 Financial systems featuring stronger 
competition, greater diversity, and closer 
integration among intermediaries are more likely 

to direct finance to its most productive use. In 

such systems, flows of finance are more closely 
guided by market signals, and financial resources 
are more competitively priced. The strong 

presence of a multitude of different intermediaries 

and financing options also expands the 

opportunities for both borrowers and lenders to 

meet their specific needs. Moreover, an 

intermediary™s capacity to originate claims is less 

constrained by its ability to bear the risks involved 

in these claims by the increased tradability of risks 
via various innovative financial instrumentsŠe.g., 
asset-backed securities (ABSs), collateralized debt 

obligations (CDOs), and credit default swaps. 

Consequently, each intermediary™s natural 

advantages are better exploited, the costs of risks 

are lowered, and the dispersion of risks becomes 

more optimal.
12 This efficiency benefit is likely to be especially 

noticeable for advanced economies. These 

economies already have in place many elements of 

the fundamental infrastructureŠe.g., strong 

tradition of rule of law, well-defined judicial 

systems, and good availability of information to 

the publicŠthat are crucial for the effectiveness 

of sophisticated financial transactions. 
Furthermore, positioned at the technological 
frontier where opportunities can be fast-changing 

and uncertainties are high, advanced economies 

would certainly benefit more than less developed 

economies from a system where finance flows 

flexibly and risks are widely distributed.  
______12 There are many other sugge
sted benefits of more sophisticated financial systems. Competitive financial markets 
encourage innovations (e.g., Holmstrom and Tirole, 1993) 

and facilitate aggregation of diffuse information (e.g., Boot 
and Thakor, 1997). The smaller vested interest the creditor 
has in the borrower and the bo
rrowing firm enhances the 
latter™s corporate governance (e.g., Dewatripont and Tirole, 
1994) and encourages competition in product markets (e.g., 
Cestone and White, 2003). 
Evidence The presence of such an efficiency benefit is 
supported by empirical work. For instance, cross-
country macroeconomic analyses
13 find that more sophisticated financial systems are associated with 

faster reorientation of the corporate sector to 
global growth opportunities, and more 
voluminous cross-border portfolio investment inflows and outflows.
14 New research based on cross-country industry-

level information confirms that the economic 

value of finance is enhanced in more sophisticated 
financial systems, that is, systems with a wider 
array of financial activities.
15 The evidence 
suggests that two channels through which finance 

benefits the economyŠthe general reduction in 

costs of external finance and improvement in 

resource allocation in the corporate sectorŠwork 
more effectively in such financial systems. 

Specifically, the positive effect of a greater 

availability of finance on the value-added growth 
of industries that are likely to be subject to the 
tighter financial constraints is larger in more 

sophisticated systems. Likewise, increased 

financial depth seems to strengthen the relative 

development (both value-added growth and 

productivity growth) of rising industries more in 

financial systems that are more sophisticated. In 

other words, more sophisticated financial systems 

appear able to derive larger efficiency gains from 
finance. Analyzing an even more detailed data set 
for Denmark suggests that the efficiency benefit 

applies also at the firm level (Box 4).
______13 See International Monetary Fund (2006b). 
14 A more sophisticated financial system here refers to one 
that has a higher score on the 
financial index developed in the 
September 2006 WEO. 15 To explicitly address possible endogeneity, rather than studying the simple correlation between finance and 
macroeconomic performance, th
e analysis exploits cross-
country industry-level data
 to examine the mechanisms 
underlying finance™s contribution to the economy. For details 
of the analysis, see Tang (2007). 
Tuning the Financial Systems of Advanced Economies 
29Garnering Benefits without Incurring Excessive Risks  Financial innovation is an important source of 
strengthened economic and financial performance 
over the medium term, but it is bound to pose 

challenges to private and public prudential 

arrangements, as highlighted by recent events. It is 

important that these challenges be met without 
undue costs to the greater availability of finance 
that innovation brings. Thus, a productive policy 

approach would be to implement measures that 

facilitate the move toward greater financial 

sophistication, while ensuring that prudential 

frameworks keep up with these developments to 

minimize the risks of financial crises. What does 
Box 4. Financial Intermediation at Work in Denmark 
Cross-country industry-level analysis in Tang (2007) suggests that under the right conditions (i.e., a high degree of 
sophistication in the financial system and a flexible labor market), finance would tend to flow to firms with tighter 
financial constraints and greater growth potential. Denmark ranks high on financial sophistication (as measured by 
the September 2006 WEO™s financial index) and has one of the most flexible labor markets in Europe. Moreover, its 
corporate sector has considerably expanded
 its recourse to external finance in recent years. Zooming in on a panel of 
firm-level data of Denmark provides an ideal test to see whether finance indeed flows as hypothesized. 
The test consists of verifying how a firm™s growth potential 
and the natural tightness of its financial constraint affect 
the amount of finance it attracts. Growth potential is measured by lagged sales growth, and the financing constraint is 
proxied by lagged cash flows and whether the industry it operates in has a high dependence on external finance. 
Reverse causality is dealt with by lagging the independent variables. Growth of debt finance is regressed on these 
variables of interest, along with current sales growth and total assets as controls. The panel data run from 2001 to 
2006 and include roughly 1,000 Danish firms in each year (see the table).  
Two main points emerge. First, the results confirm that more finance tends to flow to rising firms and firms in 
industries with high dependence on external finance. While the coefficient estimate on lagged cash flow is not 
statistically significant, it is of the expected sign.  
Second, the regressions show that the information content embedded in the flows of finance seems in fact greater 
than suggested by the cross-country results. Finance not only flows to high-growth industries, it also seeks out the 
high-growth firms within each industry.

30moving forward entail and how should risks be 
guarded against?  
Moving toward Greater 
Sophistication Competitive forces are likely to intensify 
financial integration and continue to push the 

European financial systems toward greater 
sophistication. While there have been major 

advances in integrating wholesale banking, there is 

still much room for further integration on the 

retail front. In addition, the delivery of numerous 

EU directives in the pipeline (notably the Markets 

in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID) will 
further facilitate capital flows and development of 
integrated financial services.  
 Nevertheless, the transformation of the 
financial systems is certainly not guaranteed and in 

fact does not appear to converge across countries. 

Specific domestic policy reforms are likely to be 
the main factor determining the ultimate extent 
and speed of the transformation, as illustrated by 
the experience of Italy (Box 5). 
 In certain cases, reducing involvementŠ
whether direct or indirectŠof the public sector in 

banks will be desirable. State intervention in bank 
management undermines the sector™s efficiency by 
distorting the bank™s decisions and jeopardizing 

the growth of other competitive banks.
16 Public sector divestment would remove such distortions 

and clear the way to list the banks publicly and 

subject them to greater market scrutiny and 

discipline. Improving the corporate governance of many 
large nonlisted private banks by stepping up 

disclosure requirements would yield efficiency 

gains. A particular risk of insufficient disclosure is 

that managers of these banks might engage in 

channeling finance to wher
e it produces personal

privately owned counterparts (Brunner and others, 2004). 
gains but perhaps little economic value. Stronger 
oversight of the nonlisted banks™ corporate 

governance would strengthen the role of price 

signals as a basis of their lending decisions. 
 Similarly, there is still much room for further 
reforming the banking regulations to foster 

efficiency. For instance, loosening the restrictions 

on bank consolidation would facilitate greater 

economies of scale and improve the contestability 

of the overall banking sector. Imposing stricter 

limits on banks™ industrial participation, 
meanwhile, would weaken banks™ vested interest 
in the borrowing firms and give them more 

incentives to finance product market entrants. 
 Beyond bank lending, a level playing field 
should be established for all types of financial 

activities, to encourage diversity and integration 
among intermediaries. In this regard, abolition of 
state-administered preferential deposit schemes 
and relaxation of the ceilings on interest rates and 

fees charged on financial services would induce 
creation of a wider range of investment vehicles. 

In a similar vein, modification of the legal and 

regulatory frameworks facilitating the issuance of 

financial innovations such as ABSs and CDOsŠ
which has been lagging in many advanced 
European economies17Šas well as of complex corporate securities (e.g., convertible bonds) 

would be helpful.  Finally, removal of impediments to financial 
integrationŠincluding by expediting 

harmonization of the regulatory regimes and tax 
treatment, standardizing the clearing and 
settlement systems, and relaxing national 

authorities™ restrictions on cross-border mergers 

of financial intermediariesŠwould certainly make

bonds remain on banks™ balance sheets (and hence have to be 

supported by a corresponding amou

securitization represents a more
 effective way for banks to 
raise funds and manage risks. 
Tuning the Financial Systems of Advanced Economies 
31Box 5. Upgrading a Financial System: Italy™s Experience 
The financial index of Italy™s financial system rose considerably between 1995 and 2004, showing great 
improvement in all three main components: the tr
aditional banking intermediation, the new financial 
intermediation, and the financial markets.
1In part, this development reflects Italy™s lower starting base, as its 
financial markets still remain undersized and dominated by banks.
2Domestic reforms specifically geared at 
the banking sector, firms™ corporate governance, and the securities markets have, however, prominently 
contributed to the transformation of the financial system during the period. 
Organizational Reforms: Privatizing the Major Financial Intermediaries 
A large-scale privatization program was carried out in the banking sector in the 1990s, leading to more 
intense competition among Italian banks and a more efficient and less concentrated banking sector. In 
addition, many of the privatized banks became listed on the stock exchange, making it possible for them to 
raise funds from a diverse spectrum of investors and becoming subject to market discipline. Incidentally, the 
public trading of banks™ equity also benefited the development of the stock market by increasing the 
market™s liquidity. 
The organization of the equity market has also been revamped. Following the stock exchange™s privatization 
in 1998, Borsa Italiana was created and charged with the responsibility to manage and develop the exchange. 
To complement the mandatory frameworks imposed by the state regulators, Borsa Italiana introduced a 
voluntary code of conduct (Preda Code) in 1999 to flexibly address some corporate governance issues that 
the formal requirements could not adequately deal with. Hoping to attract the listing of firms of various sizes 
and funding needsŠespecially salient given the predominance of small firms in ItalyŠBorsa Italiana 
introduced three separate exchange 
segments with different listing requirements. It is important that the 
segmentation allows smaller firms to access equity financing on the public market without incurring 
prohibitively high listing and compliance costs.  
Upgrading the Legal and Regulatory Frameworks: Bolstering Investor Protection and Facilitating 
Financial Innovations 
At the heart of greater nonbank intermediation lies investor confidence in the system™s ability to protect 
their investment, which was significantly boosted by the implementation of the Consolidated Law (Draghi 
Law) in 1998 and the Savings Law in 2005, the latter in response to corporate scandals. Along with the 
regulations introduced by Consob (a supervisory body of the stock exchange), the new law went a long way 
toward transforming corporate governance practices in Italy, particularly through a series of requirements 
aimed at improving the balance of power between the biggest shareholders and minority investors. 
Furthermore, self-dealing was made less attractive to the biggest shareholders by requiring mandatory bids 
and disclosure of material related-party transactions.
To make it easier for banks to securitize and sell their loans into capital markets, the Securitization Law was 
enacted in 1999. The increased ease of securitization expanded banks™ funding sources and enhanced their 
risk management capabilities. Last, but not least, the groundwork has been laid out for the implementation 
of many EU banking and financial market directivesŠnot
ably the Capital Requirement Directive (Basel II 
provisions) and MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive). 
1Italy™s ranking among the 18 sample countries improved in
 all three components between
 1995 and 2004. It rose from 7 to 4 in traditional banking intermediation, from 17 to 11 in
 new financial intermediation, and from 18 to 14 in capital 
market development.  2 See International Monetary Fund (2006a; 2007b).REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
32Box 5 (concluded) 
Strengthening Enforcement: Empowering Regulators Modalities of cooperation between the two supervisory authorities (Consob and Bank of Italy) charged with 
securities regulation have been clearly established, so as to facilitate exchanges of information and expertise 
while reducing the possible confusion of responsibilities. Moreover, regulators have been endowed with 
greater investigative and sanctioning authorities, thus ensuring stricter adherence to the regulations.
Unfinished Business 
Although much effort has been made to modernize the financial system,the road ahead to catch up with the 
most advanced financial systems is still long. Notwithstanding low concentration, there is further scope to 
strengthen competition among banks, as the average price of basic banking services in Italy appears to be 
one of the highest in Europe (EFMA, Capgemini, and Ing, 2005). Similarly, there is room to reduce stock 
market listing costs; strengthen and streamline 
corporate governance, accounting, and disclosure 
requirements for all corporations, especially groups; and further enhance minority shareholder protection, 
mainly by permitting class action lawsuits and enhancing the effectiveness of the civil judicial system. 
Development of the private pension pillar and further public divestment might also help. 
the environment more competitive and conducive 
to efficient financial transactions.
18Guarding against the Risks  The increasing sophistication and complexity of 
the financial system need to be accompanied by an 
upgrading of regulatory and supervisory 
frameworks to promote risk assessment and 

management capabilities, and transparency, while 

the threat to financial stability stemming from any 

inadequacies should be minimized. The recent 

financial market turbulence triggered by the 

meltdown of the U.S. subprime mortgage market 

highlights the need for prudential frameworksŠ

whether adopted by market participants or 
enforced by regulatorsŠto keep up with the 
financial innovations. Indeed, insufficient risk 

assessment and risk management capabilities, and 

lack of transparency rega
rding the counterparties™ 
risk exposures and the origination process, 

constitute interrelated vulnerabilities that 

culminated in the recent turbulence. 
______18 See Decressin, Faruqee, and Fonteyne (2007). 
Managing liquidity
 and market risks by financial 
institutions deserves heightened attention. To the 
extent that these institutions become more reliant 

on highly procyclical and volatile wholesale 

funding, their liquidity should be closely regulated 

(e.g., with respect to the concentration of funding 

sources) and monitored. In general, as market 

transactions become more widely used for both 

liquidity provision and profit generation, 

prudential risk assessment should focus on not 
only default risks, but also market risks that can 
undermine the liquidity and solvency positions of 

financial institutions. One clear lesson from the 

recent events is that liquidity risks had not been 

fully taken into account and had been poorly 

managed by many market participants.
19    
 Financial institutions, especially nonbanks, need 
to be encouraged to upgrade their risk assessmentmodels as financial systems grow in complexity 

and to perform more rigorous 
due diligence
. The tendency of many financial institutions to rely on 

ratings by external agencies for risk assessment 
______19 In particular, legal factors and concerns about reputational 
risks may force banks to reintegrate off-balance-sheet vehicles 
and fulfill contingent funding commitments. 
Tuning the Financial Systems of Advanced Economies 
33could prove to be risky itself. Ratings by such 
agencies typically reflect only their assessment of 

the financial products™ default risks, and not 

market or valuation risks. Even then, their models 

on default risk assessment tend to be highly 
sensitive to certain assumptions grounded in 
limited historical information (e.g., regarding 

correlation of defaults on the various underlying 

assets). Combined with lack of information on 

underwriting standards, excessive reliance on 

rating agencies could give rise to systemic and 

persistent mispricing of risks, as illustrated by 

recent events.
20 While rating agencies should 
improve and add to their tool kit in light of recent 
experience,
21 financial institutions need to build up 
their own due diligence capacity as well.  
 Risk assessment would be facilitated by 
improving transparency concerning 
the underwriting 
standard
 in the loan origination process. Extending 
prudential oversight to encompass the loan 
originators not currently regulated could be 
considered. Alternatively, the underwriting 

standard could be verified by a truly independent 

third party.   Raising the information standard governing the 
counterparties™ risk disclosure
 would also be beneficial. Inadequate information about market participants™ 
______20 The lack of transparency on th
e origination process may, in 
turn, encourage the originators to adopt a laxer underwriting 
standard.21 For instance, there have been recent discussions on 
creating measures of valuation 
risks in the rating agencies™ 
assessments. 
risk exposuresŠespecially through their 
contingent and off-balance-sheet activitiesŠ

increases uncertainty face
d by potential lenders and can cause funding channels to seize up in 

times of strain. More comprehensive and uniform 
accounting and regulatory treatment of illiquid 
financial instruments and contingent and off-

balance-sheet items may be necessary.  
 Finally, authorities™ 
supervisory capacity
 may need 
further boosting. There is scope for greater 

cooperation among supervisors across sectors and 
borders. Insurance companies and pension funds 
have been increasingly assuming the risks 

transferred from banks via complex financial 

instruments. Hence, where still insufficient, more 

sharing of expertise by the prudential supervisors 

of the insurance and pension industries and their 

bank colleagues would be highly desirable. The 

effectiveness of crisis management
 by the regulators 
and central banks may need to be reviewed, in 
particular in dealing with individual problem 
institutions and system-wide liquidity strains. 

Overall, central bank responses have been 

effective, but European authorities may need to 

strengthen their capacity to enforce early remedial 

action and to intervene rapidly in troubled 

institutions in order to preserve overall 

confidence.352.  Managing Rapid Financial Deepening in Emerging Europe  Income convergence in emerging Europe has been 
accompanied by rapid financial deepening. Financial 

intermediaries have played a primary role in channeling 
capital flows into the region, benefiting consumers, 
producers, and investors alike. But the resulting high speed 

of convergence is engendering short-term risks and medium-

term challenges. To ensure ﬁsafe drivingﬂ at considerable 

speed, and thus smooth convergence, policymakers will need 

to adopt a cautious approach. Faced with the uncertainties 

involved, reducing vulnerabilities and building buffers will 

be essential. Where convergence has been associated with 

large external imbalances, the challenge is to ﬁprepare for 
the curve ahead,ﬂ which is to turn around these imbalances 
without painful adjustment. This will require that resources 

flow without hindrance to productive investments, 

particularly in the tradables sector. Policymakers will need 

to strengthen their financial systems and raise the flexibility 

of labor and capital markets.
* For a number of years, the financial systems of 
Europe™s emerging economies have been playing a 
key role in these economies™ convergence and 

integration with advanced economies. Along with 

foreign direct investment (FDI), financial systems 

have been the principal conduits for the vast flow 

of capital into the region. Financial intermediaries 

have sparked in most recipient countries a rapid, if 

not blistering, pace of financial deepening.
22 Rapid financial deepening has brought both 

benefits and risks to borrowers and investors. The 

benefits have come in the form of consumption 

smoothing, diversification, and risk sharing, but 

they have not accrued uniformly. The pace of 
______Note: The main authors of this chapter are Rudolfs Bems and 
Philip Schellekens. The analyti
cal underpinnings of this 
chapter and the details of the simulations are presented in Bems and Schellekens (2007). 
22 Financial deepening will be interpreted here narrowly as the expansion of credit to resident
 nonfinancial corporations and 
households. financial deepening differs markedly across 
countries. And there are concerns that its speed is 

too high in some countries, posing risks to 
macroeconomic and financial stability.  
 Policymakers have struggled with the question 
of whether and how to manage fast-paced 

financial deepening. Some observers have taken 

the view that countries are on a one-way road to 

prosperity and that the risks pale in comparison to 
the benefits. Some, however, have interpreted the 
risks as high and rising, as evidenced by the 
swelling of imbalances. And those who have tried 

to slow capital inflows and credit expansions have 

been thwarted because the available policy options 

turned out to be either limited or ineffective.  
 Against this background, this chapter, after 
reviewing finance™s role in the convergence 

process, advocates a two-pronged approach to 

addressing the policy challenges associated with 

rapid financial deepening: Driving safely at high speed.
 With policies having 
had limited success in slowing the speed of credit growth, policymakers need to focus on 
reducing vulnerabilities and building safety margins. Such caution is desirable because of 
uncertainty about the extent to which the 
observed pace of convergence is an 
equilibrium phenomenon. In addition, it 

provides a buffer against sudden shifts in 
market sentiment that may be unrelated to 
country fundamentals. 
Preparing for the curve ahead.
 An often-overlooked 
aspect is that the ongoi
ng convergence process 
will entail a fundamental reorientation of the 
economies involved. Protracted current account imbalances will have to change course, 
and resources will need to shift to productive 
investments, particularly in the tradables sector 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
36to help boost exports; otherwise, an abrupt 
correction or a prolonged period of slow growth 
may follow. Private sector agents will need to be 
aware that such a turnaround is inevitable. 
Policymakers would do well to focus on reforms that will facilitate the smooth rebalancing of the 

sources of growth.Finance™s Role in Convergence Capital Inflows and Financial 
Deepening  Convergence in emerging economies has been 
greatly helped by massive inflows of capital. Over 

the last two decades, it has become clear that the 

growth potential in these economies is very large. 
As the economies have opened up, and their financial systems have reached a basic threshold of 
development, investors have taken advantage by 

injecting capital, thereby accelerating the 

convergence process. Income levels have been 

catching up quickly, with the fastest progress 

observed in the Baltics, Bulgaria, and Romania 

(Figure 21), countries that started from low levels. 

Not surprisingly, these countries have also been 

experiencing the largest current account deficits in 
the region (Figure 22).  
 Conceptually, the quickest way to prosperity 
involves some degree of capital inflows (Figure 

23). Where capital does not flow inŠperhaps 

because lenders are worried about a country™s 

ability to repayŠconsumption and investment will 
grow more slowly. Savings will need to be set 
aside to fund the expansion, and higher interest 

rates will provide this incentive. Capital inflows 

fast-forward this process: consumption can 

accelerate more quickly and increase well before 

production rises. Financial systems have played a vital role in 
intermediating the capital inflows into emerging 

Europe, quickening the pace of financial 

deepening. Initially, finance arrived in large 

quantities, with FDI providing the lion™s share. As 

financial development and bank consolidation 

progressed with the help of foreign investors, 

however, financial systems came to play a 

paramount role.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
38 Financial deepening has been driven almost 
exclusively by the large expansion of bank-

intermediated credit (Table 4). This expansion is, 

however, by no means uniform across countries, 

in part because starting points have differed. 

While the pace of financial deepening in the 

Baltics and the Balkans has been very fast, others, 

such as the Czech Republic and Poland, have 
experienced a much more subdued pace, at least 
until very recently. Financial Globalization and Risk  A striking aspect of the convergence in 
emerging Europe is that it has been taking place 
on the back of increasing financial globalization. 

Financial globalization has created vast 

opportunities for diversification and risk sharing, 
further enhancing finance™s role in convergence. 
The degree of financial globalization, as measured 

by the ratio of total foreign assets and liabilities to 

GDP, has reached high levels in many emerging 

European countries (Figure 24). Moreover, as 
illustrated in Figure 22, capital has been flowing 
from richer to poorer countries. 
 In this convergence process, diversification and 
risk sharing have materialized concretely through 

the operations of foreign banks and the inflow of 

FDI. In the search for higher profitability, foreign 
banks have diversified themselves by endowing 
affiliates abroad with large amounts of risk capital. 

This risk capital funds opportunities with higher 

returns. The risk-sharing nature of FDI is well 

known: FDI seeks to take advantage of upside 

profit potential, but also bears part of the 

downside risk.  Greater risk sharing is, in principle, welfare 
improving and can further speed the convergence 

process. Uncertainty about the outcome is an 

integral part of this process, especially when 

current developments are driven by expected 
future gains in productivity and income levels. 

Financial globalization may allow for the transfer 

of risk to those most willing to bear it. Thus, from 
the point of view of borrowers, the opportunities 
for better risk sharing a
dd to the attractiveness of foreign capital inflows and enlarge the current 

account deficit.  
Two Stages of Convergence 
 How do the inflow of capital and the process 

of financial deepening allow economies to 

converge to higher income levels? It is useful to 

highlightŠin a stylized mannerŠtwo stages that 

pose distinct policy challenges:  
The expansion stage
 features large capital 
inflows, a growing current account deficit, and 

an acceleration in spending on tradable and 

nontradable goods. Whereas tradables can be 
easily imported from abroad, nontradables 
need to be produced locally, creating a 
bottleneck in the expansion stage. Excess

39demand will push up the relative price of 
nontradables, produce a real exchange rate 
appreciation, and result in a shift of resources 
to the nontradables sector. 
Barring accidents, this is followed by a 
reorientation stage
 that is characterized by a 
rebalancing of the current account. Capacity in 
the nontradables sector would be built up 
gradually, dampening the price pressure. The 
relative price of nontradables would fall, and 
resources would shift back to the tradables 

sector. This sector will need to expand so that domestic demand can be satisfied and the foreign debt serviced. 
Clearly, most emerging economies in Europe 
are still in the firstŠexpansionŠstage of 
convergence. This is evidenced by the still-large 
potential for catching up with the income levels of 
advanced economies. It is also evident because the 
ongoing financial deepening still benefits the 

nontradables sector disproportionately. For 
example, whereas over 2000Œ06 credit to the 
nonfinancial tradables sector stagnated, credit to 
the nontradables sector more than doubled 
(Figure 25). Similarly, over the same period, 
households saw a tripling in credit for housing 
purposes, whereas consumer credit and other 

types of credit roughly doubled (Figure 26). 
Driving Safely at High Speed  
 What can be done to ensure the expansion 
stage goes smoothly and sets the country on a 
secure path to greater welfare and faster growth? 

Clearly, the faster convergence is, the more 

quickly benefits are realized; however, the more 

likely also that risks appear. The main challenge in 

the expansion stage will therefore be to ﬁdrive 

safely.ﬂ But what are the speed limits? Can one tell 

whether they are being broken? And, what can 

policymakers do about it?  
Do We Know the Speed Limits? 
 Unsurprisingly, this question offers a fertile 

ground for debate (Demekas, 2007). The speed 

limits to the inflow of capital and financial 

deepening are not only hard to measure, they are 

also neither unique across countries nor fixed over 

time. Consider the following three important 

determinants:

40Productivity gains. How bright is the future, 
really? This will matter much for the optimal 

speed limit. Greater future productivity will 
justify higher speed or, in other words, larger 
current account deficits. But larger deficits will 
also imply greater shifts in and out of the 
nontradables sector, producing larger swings in 
prices.Factor market flexibility. How flexibly can an 
economy adapt itself to this bright future? 
Critical in this regard is the flexibility of labor 
and capital markets. Greater flexibility means 
greater compatibility with higher speed limits 
and larger imbalances.  
Financial development.
 How financially developed 
is the economy to begin with? Europe™s 
emerging economies still differ significantly 
from its advanced economies in terms of 
financial regulation, supervision, and 

infrastructure. Where further reforms are 
warranted, convergence and financial deepening will accelerate. However, the speed 
of financial deepening needs to remain 
commensurate with the degree of financial 

development. For example, in the absence of 
sound arrangements for the liquidation of 
collateral, a speedy expansion of credit may 
generate unnecessary systemic risks 
(Schellekens, 2000).Theory provides only qualitative guidance. 
Nonetheless, Figure 27 is suggestive. 
Conceptually, larger current account deficits are 
consistent with larger productivity improvements 

(the positively sloped lines, generated from model 
simulations), and flexibility in the labor and capital 
markets allows for greater latitude in borrowing 
from abroad for a given productivity 
improvement (the blue versus the red line). Introducing actual data into the figure illustrates that whether the current account deficits are too 

high depends on a host of factors. If factor 
flexibility were low (the red line), all countries 
would appear to be speeding. Conversely, if factor 
markets were highly flexible (the blue line), all of 
them would appear to be crawling. Thus, speed 
limits are largely unknowable, but increasing 
productivity and the flexibility of factor markets 

are key to strengthening the sustainability of the 

current account. 
Breaking the Speed Limits  When driving become
s unsafe, policymakers have an unmistakable role to intervene. Indeed, if 

the speed limits are being broken, fast 

convergence and rapid financial deepening give 

rise to a litany of concerns that must be addressed. 

And, the financial sector may exacerbate these 

concerns. In this regard, the policy challenges 
faced in Latvia provide an interesting case study 
(Box 6).  Among the macroeconomic concerns, the 
significant problem is that breaking the speed 

limits leads to demand outstripping supply, 

putting excessive upward pressure on prices and 

wages and causing overheating. Monetary and 

fiscal policies are normally expected to be able to 
control these outcomes, but their effectiveness is

41limited in small economies facing strong capital 
flows. Hence, overheating can be associated with a 

loss of competitiveness and inflated asset prices. 

Subsequently, debt-service problems may arise 

when exchange rates or
 asset prices adjust, especially if they do so abruptly, as recent 
emerging market crises have illustrated.  
 The financial sector may exacerbate these 
vulnerabilities in several ways: 
The financial sector can raise an economy™s 
volatility through the ﬁfinancial acceleratorﬂ 
(Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997). Banks and financial institutions usually require collateral 
for lending. When asset prices rise, so do 

collateral values, thereby ﬁacceleratingﬂ the 
capacity of borrowers to obtain credit. 
However, it may well be that the initial lending 
was behind the increase in the asset™s price in the first place. The upshot is that prices tend to 

be more volatile as a result of the interaction 
between lending and collateral values 
(Figure 28). As financial institutions compete for market 
share,lending standards may deteriorate. 
Households and corporations could end up 
with too much debt, or with too much risk, for 
example by lending in foreign currency or 
exclusively at variable interest rates. This 
behavior played an important role in the 

subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. 
In emerging Europe, the main concern is the 
large share of liabilities outstanding in foreign 
currency (Figure 29). 
Overconfidence may lay the groundwork for a 
boom-and-bust cycle. Overconfidence may 
arise in connection with the prospect of 
adopting the euro or joining the European  
Union. Borrowers and lenders may have 
inflated views about productivity and income. 

The financial sector may allow overoptimistic 
agents to borrow, driving prices above Figure 29. Share of Foreign Currency Loans in Total

42Box 6. Addressing Financial Speeding in LatviaLatvia, perhaps more than other recent EU entrants, has enjoyed very rapid convergence in income levels 
over the past decade. Closer integration of goods, capital, and labor markets in the rest of Europe has 
created favorable investment opportunities and spurred large inflows of foreign financing. Consequently, 
capital and technology stocks have risen, and new employment opportunities have emergedŠboth in Latvia 
and abroad.  
But fast credit and wage growth have recently 
caused Latvia to diverge from a balanced and 
sustainable growth path. Overheating has 
intensified, driving the current account to a 
record deficit and magnifying external 
indebtedness. Rapid credit growth in euros has 
left large currency mismatches on the balance 
sheets of households and corporates. Procyclical 
macroeconomic and prudential policies have 
aggravated such trends. 
Heavy borrowing for real estate have led to the 
diversion of resources to the nontradables sector 
to the detriment of competitiveness (first and 
second figures). This skewed pattern of 
development reflects the undertaxation of real 
estate relative to other sectors and a perception 
by banks that mortgage lending is less risky than 
lending to manufacturing. Real estate™s 
attractiveness as a saving vehicle has been 
reinforced by negative real interest rates, the 
absence of alternative saving to match 
instruments, andŠuntil recentlyŠsustained 
rapid increases in housing prices, all of which 
have reinforced perceptions of a one-way bet. 
Latvia™s small size and limited workforce have 
impeded the establishment of large export-
oriented manufacturing projects. 
Returning to a balanced growth path will require 
efforts to curb domestic spending and wage 
growth: 
Avoiding a procyclical fiscal policy would 
help directly. By signaling the government™s 
concern about widening imbalances, it would 
also dampen overly optimistic private sector 
expectations. 
Efforts to curtail lending and improve the risk profile of new credit would help mitigate macroeconomic 
and financial stability risks. The issuance of loans only on the basis of legally documented income, the 
establishment of a comprehensive register for 
all loans, and a minimum 10 percent down payment 
requirement will support these objectives.

43Additional financial regulatory measures would help induce banks to internalize systemic risks in real 
estate and currency markets. The financial regulator 
could intensify on-site inspections of large banks, 
ensuring credit risk models are tailored to the Latvian context. 
Further efforts are needed to rebalance incentives for investment in the tradables sector: 
Incentives for investment in real estate need to be scaled back. Recent increases in real estate taxation 
and plans for periodic reassessments of cadastral values are steps in the right direction. But, to be 
effective, enforcement of real estateŒrelat
ed taxation would need to be stepped up.  
Through wage agreements, the public sector could demonstrate its understanding that wage growth 
should be kept in line with productivity growth. Simila
rly, social partners could secure a broad consensus 
for wage restraint.

entrepreneurship, and innovation in traditional and new export sectors.
fundamental levels (Figure 30). However, if the 
expectations are not validated, the bust will be 
even bigger.
Foreign bank contagion
 raises additional concerns. 
Certainly, the significant presence of foreign 
banks (Figure 31) has increased the availability 

of credit, and promoted financial development 
and reform more generally. Indeed, support 
from well-capitalized parents makes banks less 
vulnerable to local financial conditions. Hence, 
foreign banks have also been credited with 
providing a degree of stability. Yet, the 

concentrated number of international players 
and the similarity of their activities expose 
emerging economies to common-lender 
contagion risks (Table 5). Changes in market 
sentiments or strategic shifts at the parent level 

could amplify the impact of foreign shocks on 
the host country and create ripple effects 
throughout the region. Figure 31. Asset Share of Foreign-Owned Banks,

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
44Reducing Vulnerabilities and Building Buffers  Faced with considerable uncertainties about 
speed limits but consensus about the potential 

cost of vulnerabilities, policymakers in most 
countries have taken concrete measures to address 
vulnerabilities. They have undertaken 

macroeconomic tigh
tening: raising interest rates or 
reserve and liquidity requirements and reducing 
fiscal deficits or building up surpluses. Prudential 
and supervisory regulations have also been 

tightened, and monitoring 
has been stepped up to make sure banks uphold sound loan granting 
standards. In a few cases, marginal reserve 
requirements have been imposed on foreign 
borrowing (Hilbers, Ötker-Robe, and 

Pazarbasioglu, 2007). While these measures have helped dampen 
credit growth, rapid credit growth remains a 

concern in most countries. Countries with 
relatively tight fiscal policies are still experiencing 
very large capital inflows and current account 

deficits (such as Bulgaria and Estonia). Rapid 

deposit growth or easy access to funding by the 

parent bank has limited any impact that policies 

might have had on banks™ cost of funds. 

Significantly tightening reserve requirements 

seems to have had at best a transitory impact on 

credit growth, as borrowers and banks have found 
ways to circumvent these controls (as has 
happened, for example, in Croatia and Latvia). 

Where controls result in direct borrowing from 

abroad, prudential concerns may arise. Finally, the 

literature shows that capital controls, apart from 

being largely infeasible in EU member states, may 
not make a lasting impact (International Monetary 
Fund, 2007c).  What else can be done? With the boom a 
reality and policies largely ineffective in stemming 

the tide, it will be key to focus efforts on further 

reducing vulnerabilities and building in safety 
margins. Policymakers will need to be pragmatic 

and take into account the worse-case scenario. 

Such an approach would be consistent with 

strengthening or main
taining the following 
measures (selective country examples where the 
IMF has advocated these measures are provided in 
parentheses): 
Tightening macroeconomic policies:
 tightening fiscal 
policy, to cool off or not to add to existing 
demand pressures (the Baltics); eliminating 
fiscal incentives contributing to the 

nontradable boom (Latvia); conducting 
incomes policies that promote wage restraint 
supported by productivity growth (Romania); 
tightening monetary policies (Ukraine); and 
increasing reserve requirements (Bulgaria).  
Raising prudential standards:
 directing prudential 
efforts to remove distortions in bank lending 
associated with, for example, risky sectoral 
allocations, unhedged currency borrowing, 
imprudent funding behavior by banks, or real 

estate bubbles; identifying bank-specific capital 
requirements and raising them where 
necessary; and establishing risk-based and 
forward-looking supervision (Bulgaria, Latvia, 
Romania, and the Slovak Republic). 
Upgrading supervisory cooperation and coordination:
guaranteeing the effective implementation of 

prudential and supervisory measures by 
ensuring an adequate enforcement capacity, 
cross-border cooperation between home and 
host supervisors, and coordination among 
supervisors of nonbank financial institutions to 

avoid loopholes (the Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Lithuania, Poland, and the Slovak Republic). 
Enhancing risk disclosure:
 supporting a better 
disclosure and understanding of risks by 
conducting public awareness campaigns and

Managing Rapid Financial Deepening in Emerging Europe 
45strengthening market discipline for banks by 
tightening disclosure requirements of risk 
management and internal control policies and 
practices (the Baltics, Croatia, Hungary, 
Poland, and the Slovak Republic). 
Preparing for the Curve AheadReversing the Current Account Imbalances Even if driving fast is safe, policymakers will 
need to take curves carefully to avoid accidents. 

Converging economies inevitably face the 

requirement to service their debt and turn around 

their current account imbalances (Figure 32). The 

larger the current account deficits, the greater this 

challenge will be. And the larger the extent to 

which the inflow of resources has fed the boom in 
nontradables, the greater the reorientation in the 
structure of production will have to be. Thus, 

tradable output will need to rise again relative to 

nontradable output.  
 An equally vital policy challenge will be to 
deliver on the expectations of higher productivity. 
It is on these expectations that consumption, 
investment, and borrowing decisions have been 

made. If they turn out to be invalid, the 

rebalancing of the current account and the 

reorientation of production will prove even more 
difficult and painful. Instructive in this regard is 
the experience of Portugal, which experienced a 

large credit boom on the back of expectations that 

failed to materialize (Box 7).  
 With the credit-driven expansion of the 
nontradables sector a reality, and the rebalancing 

of growth toward exports an eventual necessity, 

the main issue is how to equip the economies and 

financial systems of emerging economies with the 

tools to support such a turnaround. Inevitably, the 

growth in credit to households will need to slow, 
in relative terms, and more financial resources will 
need to flow to productive investments. A key 

concern is that countries are not implementing 

sufficient reforms to facilitate these developments. 

Besides generally pursuing sound macroeconomic 

policies, bringing supervision and regulation in 

line with best practice, and avoiding 

microeconomic distortions, what else can policy 

makers do? Fostering Flexibility  
 Flexible labor and capital markets are key to 

support the unencumbered flow of resources 

from nontradables to tradables (Figure 33). As 
Portugal™s experience exemplifies (Box 7), running 
large current account deficits is an undesirable 

proposition when factor markets lack sufficient 

flexibility.Figure 32. Two Stages of Convergence

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
46Box 7. Rapid Financial Deepening: Lessons from Portugal 
Rapid financial deepening occurred in Portugal during the 1990s, when membership in the Exchange Rate 
Mechanism (ERM) and the prospect of euro adoption resulted in a sharp drop in risk premiums and interest 
rates. The resulting credit boom fueled a surge in domestic demand (first figure). With economic agents 
expecting permanently higher steady-state growth 
in monetary union, consumption and investment 
grew rapidly, housing and construction boomed, 
and income converged rapidly to the EU average 
(second figure). The corresponding decline in 
savings and rise in imports helped widen the 
current account deficit. 
However, the anticipated high productivity 
growth did not materialize after Portugal adopted 
the euro in 1999. Consequently, domestic 
demand growth slowed and turned negative in 
2002Œ03, as firms and households sought to 
work off the imbalances of the boom years. 
Cyclical difficulties were compounded by 
worrying structural developments, as productivity 
and competitivenessŠwhose weaknesses were 
masked by the boomŠcontinued to flag. Real 
convergence shifted into reverse. In response to 
this challenging situation, the authorities have 
been taking decisive action to correct the 
imbalances accumulated during the 1990s.  
Portugal™s boom and slump offer interesting 
lessons for Europe™s emerging economies, which 
are experiencing a phase of rapid financial 
deepening similar to Portugal™s a decade ago: 
A painful adjustment period may ensue if 
expectations of future high productivity are 
not fulfilled and financial resources are not 
channeled into productive investment. 
During the second half of the 1990s, Portugal™s competitiveness declined, as wage growth outstripped 
productivity. With sticky downward wages and a relatively rigid labor market, reorienting resources to 
the competitive industries in the tradables sector beca
me a daunting task, resulting in a period of slow 
growth.  
Vulnerabilities to the financial system can arise when private sector indebtedness reaches unprecedented 
levels. The household and corporate debt levels in Portugal did not particularly stand out in Europe 
before the credit boom. However, by 2005, household debt as a percent of disposable income was the 
second-highest in the European Union, and corporate debt to GDP was also among the highest. These 
high debt levels can make the financial system vulnerable to credit risks if employment or interest rates 
evolve adversely. The need for bala
nce sheet adjustment stemming from the high debt levels could also 
restrain domestic demand during the recovery.

Managing Rapid Financial Deepening in Emerging Europe 
47Prudential policies play a paramount role. Rapid financial deepening makes it necessary to sharpen the 
focus on regulation and supervision conducive to the sound management of typically rising credit risks. 
Mounting private indebtedness and the concentration of credit in sectors such as real estate were key 
sources of risk for Portugal. In this regard, its financial system weathered the economic turmoil 
surprisingly well, helped by successful guidance from the Bank of Portugal. 
Procyclical fiscal policy tends to be harmful. Fisc
al policy would be expected to counter the booming 
demand associated with rapid financial deepening. But Portugal™s fiscal policy was mostly procyclical, 
thereby aggravating the amplitude of the boom. Furthe
rmore, the lack of fiscal consolidation precluded 
fiscal expansion to help deal with the slump.
 There is especially scope for improving labor 
market flexibilityŠa particularly pressing objective 
given that the countries where credit grew quickly 
also seem to have more rigid labor markets 

(Figure 34). Against this background, it would 

certainly be very risky for countries converging 

rapidly to advanced-economy income levels to 

also aspire to match th
e generosity of advanced-
economy welfare states. The labor market 

rigidities often associated with a more generous 

welfare state may inhibit the smooth transition of 
resources to the tradables sector, thereby 
unnecessarily prolonging the reorientation phase. 
 The need for flexible labor and capital markets 
is particularly important where exchange rate 
flexibility is limited. With such limited flexibility, 
domestic factor prices, in particular wages, will 

need to carry the burden of the price adjustment. 

Factor market flexibility may alleviate this burden 

by ensuring that labor and capital are sufficiently 

responsive to price signals. 
 Furthermore, the diversification of financial 
systems in emerging economies will make capital 

markets more flexible. As these economies catch 

up and integrate further with the advanced 

economies of Europe, the financing options 

provided by their financial systems will broaden. 

As noted in Chapter 1, more diversified financial 

systems are able to identify and support rapidly 

rising industries more quickly, which will improve 
the flexibility of capital markets. 
Improving Financial Infrastructure To allow financial systems to provide more 
resources to the corporate sector, building a 

supportive, enabling financial infrastructure will be 

essential, as discussed in detail in Chapter 3. 

Creditors need good protection, provided through 

strict enforcement of bankruptcy and insolvency 

laws that meet international best practice 

standards. Improving corporate governance is 
essential in a number of
 emerging economies, and will require changes in legislation and 

enforcement. In addition, providing more and 

better credit information will help financial 

institutions channel resources to the corporate

48sector. In this context, fostering the development 
of credit registries is crucial. 
  Other parts of the financial system need to be 
developed as well, especially to fill in missing 

market segments. This would benefit the mobilization of domestic savings and thereby help 

rebalance the current account. Under the proper  
safeguards noted in Chapter 1, the development 
of securitization and asset-backed securities 

markets continues to have an important role to 

play. The development of basic derivatives 

markets would also be critical in this respect, 
helping to deepen markets in underlying securities 
and better allocate risks.
493.  Sustaining Financial Development in 
Emerging Europe Financial development has advanced to varying degrees 
in emerging Europe. Macroeconomic stability and good 

institutional quality and law enforceability appear to have 
been key forces. Building on recent progress, further reforms 
are needed to complete the establishment of deep, liquid, 

diversified, and stable financial markets. This will yield 

benefits in terms of efficiency, risk diversification, and 

resilience in the face of possibly volatile external capital 

flows. Going forward, the EU integration process is likely 

to drive reforms in EU members. In non-EU emerging 

economies, the focus should be on reinforcing the foundations 

of financial development, including the rule of law, creating 
a well-functioning government securities market, 
establishing stronger corporate governance and creditor 

rights protection, and promoting a favorable environment for 

the emergence of institutional investors. Reforms need to be 

tailored to specific country circumstances as illustrated in the 

boxes presented in this chapter.
*What Is the State of Financial Development? Financial development in emerging Europe has 
progressed considerably since the early 1990s, 
with banks dominating. Thus bank credit remains 

the most important form of financial 

intermediation. After its dramatic expansion of the 

past few years, bank credit is now roughly in line 

with the ranking implied by per capita income 

levels in most countries (Figure 35). Securities 

markets are less developed, with significant 

differences across countries. On one side of the 
spectrum are countries like the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, and Turkey, where at least two 

different segmentsŠgovernment securities and 

equitiesŠare relatively well developed. On the 

other side are countries, such as Belarus, where all 

capital market segments are still in their infancy. 
______Note: The main author of this
 chapter is Edda Zoli. The underpinning analytical work 
is presented in Zoli (2007). 
 The depth and liquidity of the government 
securities market mainly reflect current and past 

public sector financing needs. Hence, Central 

European countries and Turkey have well-
established government securities markets. 
Improving corporate governance in emerging 

Europe is only beginning to set the stage for the 

development of the corporate securities market. 

The outstanding stock of nonfinancial corporate 

debt securities has remained below 5 percent of 

GDP everywhere (Figure 36). Even in countries 

where corporate issues have grown more 

significantly in the past few years, such as Russia 
and Ukraine, they are concentrated in a few 
sectors. Trading volume in the secondary market 

is generally too low to provide adequate liquidity 

and continuous price discovery. The market for 

securities issued by financial institutions is 
somewhat deeper and expanding faster than the nonfinancial corporate bond market.

50 Equity markets have grown rapidly in the past 
few years, especially in Southeastern Europe and 

Russia, where market capitalization has reached 

surprisingly high levels. Nevertheless, liquidityŠas 

measured by the turnover ratio23Šis typically low 
throughout the region (Figure 37). The free 

floatŠthe portion of shares available to the 
investing publicŠis often small, and trading is 
concentrated in a few stocks. Capitalization tends 

to be concentrated in a small number of 

companies, even in countries with relatively well- 

developed marketsŠlike the Czech Republic, 

Hungary, Poland, and Turkey.  
 Nonbank financial institutions, including 
pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance 
companies, are mostly just beginning to emerge 

(Figure 38). In countries that introduced pension 
and regulatory reforms early on, pension fund 

assets are already high by regional standards, and 

even in comparison to some advanced economies. 
______23 The turnover ratio is defined as the value of trading relative to market capitalization. 
For instance, pension fund assets in percent of 
GDP are higher in Croatia, Hungary, and Poland 

than in Germany and Italy. The presence of 

mutual funds and insurance is small virtually 
everywhere. Mutual fund assets are over 5 percent 

of GDP only in the four largest Central European 

countries, plus Croatia and Estonia. Similarly,

24Which Factors Are Key?  
 A stable macroeconomic environment is 

essential for financial development. The level and 
volatility of inflation can be used to gauge overall 

macroeconomic stability. High and volatile 

inflation obscures the signaling role of price 

changes, creates uncertainty about returns on 
investment, and discourages demand for financial 
assets.25 Not surprisingly, therefore, empirical 
research finds that high inflation rates have a 

negative impact on financial development. A study 
on emerging Europe in particular, conducted as 

background to this chap
ter, indicates that high inflation was associated with lower bank credit to 

the private sector during 1995Œ2006, and that 

single-digit rates, as opposed to higher rates, 
favored private credit development. Rising income 
levels, and the associated increasing complexity of 

economic structure, also contributed to financial 

deepening.  
 Good institutional quality and law 
enforceability by the judiciary and the entire legal 
system are the foundations of financial 
development. Only if property rights are strongly 

respected can the financial sector effectively trade 

and intermediate claims on assets and use 

collateral to extend credit.26 Conversely, the 
financial sector can hardly flourish in an 

environment of corruption, low-quality 

bureaucracy, and an inadequate rule of law, as 

these jeopardize investor protection and contract 
enforceability. Our empirical analysis on emerging 
Europe confirms a positive and significant 

relationship between indicators of institutional 

quality and bank credit (Figure 39). 
______24 Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and 
Slovenia.25 Huybens and Smith (1999); and Boyd, Levine, and Smith 
(2001).26 Johnson, McMillan, and Woodruff (2002); and Acemoglu, 
Johnson, and Robinson (2004). 
 The development of equity and corporate debt 
securities markets requires appropriate legislation 
and strong corporate governance, including 

adequate disclosure of corporate activities and 

proper accounting rules and practices.
27 Similarly, the development of private credit intermediation 
and the debt securities market depends on 

adequate creditor rights protection through 

collateral and bankruptcy laws, as well as credit 

information disclosure.28 In our empirical study on 
emerging Europe, a measur
e of creditor rights protection is found to have been significantly 

associated with higher bank credit during 1999Œ

and Shleifer (2005). 
29 For emerging Europe, explaining the development of 
segments of the financial sector other than bank credit is 
challenging. Econometric studies on the determinants of 
development of debt securiti
es markets in the region are 
hampered by data limitations. For the equity market, while 
earlier empirical work underscored the role of the 
privatization process, single-dig
it inflation, rising income, 
shareholder protection, and inst
itutional investor assets in 
fostering market capitalization during the 1990s, our recent 
study could not confirm these findings. Figure 39. Bank Credit and Institutional Quality

52How Can Progress Be 
Sustained? While all emerging European economies have 
made important advances in setting the foundations for financial development, looking forward it is useful to distinguish between two 

groups of countries:  
The members of the European Union,
 where the ongoing process of creating a single market in 
financial services can be expected to continue 
to fuel further comprehensive reforms. Changes in securities market legislation, regulatory and supervisory frameworks for 
both bank and nonbank institutions, clearing 
and settlements systems, and other important 

financial areas are all being driven by the 
harmonization process across all EU members. 
Not only that, but EU financial integration is 
likely to shape overall financial development, 
providing both opportunities and challenges. 
The emerging economies that are not part of the 
European Union,
 where reforms will need to be domestically driven, even though European 
integration and financial globalization more 
generally can be expected to continue to foster 
financial development. At this stage, these 
countries should focus on reinforcing the 
foundations for financial development, including the rule of law, creating a well-
functioning government securities market, 
establishing stronger corporate governance and 
creditor rights protection, and promoting a 

favorable environment for the emergence of 
institutional investors. 
Financial Development in EU 
Countries: The Role of Integration Although emerging economies that joined the 
European Union have carried out comprehensive 

reforms to comply with the 
acquis communautaire
,much remains to be done. Further strengthening 

of institutional quality will allow these economies 

to catch up with advanced economies in this 
respect (Figure 40). The regulatory and 
supervisory frameworks for banking, insurance, 
and securities are already stronger than in non-EU 
emerging economies, but compliance can be 

further improved to fully meet international 

standards (Cihák and Tieman, 2007). It will also be 

important for financial development to continue 

to reinforce creditor rights protection through 

collateral and bankruptcy laws, as well as Figure 40. Institutional Quality Index, 2006

53information disclosure (Figures 41 and 42), and to upgrade corporate governance regulation and 

practices (Figure 43). 
 For EU emerging economies, the EU financial 
integration process is likely to be the main force 

propelling and shaping financial development. The 
European Union is heading toward a single 

market in financial services,
30 which creates both an opportunity and a challenge for emerging 

economies. On the one hand, it will allow better 

diversification of financing and investment 
options and strengthen competition. On the other, 
it will raise exposure to the potential risks 

associated with cross-border movements in capital 

flows. In this respect, rapid and full 

implementation of the relevant EU Directives will 

be key to making further progress in terms of 

laws, regulations, and practices, strengthening the 

financial sector, securing domestic and foreign 

investor confidence, and establishing emerging 
economies as important players in the EU 
financial market. 
 EU members also need to adapt their financial 
development strategy to 
take into account the opportunities as well as the constraints created by 

financial integration. For example, as countries 
move toward euro adoption, companies™ 
increasing access to foreign resources raises 

questions about the need for domestic currencyŒ

denominated corporate bond markets. For small 

countries, in particular, the increased competition 

associated with financial integration imposes 

strong pressure to find niche markets with a local 
comparative advantage. For these countries, 

joining regional markets, rather than developing ______30 Major steps in this direction 
were taken with the Financial 
Services Action Plan (FSAP), the Lamfalussy process, and the

barriers to the cross-border flow
 of financial services and 
capital within the European Un
ion. The Lamfalussy process 
was established in 2001 to facilitate the implementation of the 
FSAP regulatory framework. The Commission White Paper 
on Financial Services Policy sets the priorities for EU-level

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
54Box 8. National versus Regional Exchange Markets: Implications for Emerging Europe 
The operation of a national financial exchange has trad
itionally been seen as a sign of financial sector 
sophistication. A nationally based exchange can have advantages: traded assets are subject to the same legal 
and tax system, secure and rapid settlement is facilitated, exchange and investment regulations are 
homogeneous, and, perhaps most important, market participants have ready access to information on listed 
companies and the macroeconomic context. Many countr
ies in emerging Europe have established national 
exchanges, some of which are very small. 
With increasing financial integration, these markets fa
ce more competition and, therefore, need to change 
strategy if they want to survive, as large local corpor
ations seek listings overseas, investors have free access 
to all European markets, and trading is diverted abroad.
1Moreover, the new EU Markets in Financial 
Instruments Directive, an important step toward the creati
on of a securities market in Europe, is likely boost 
competition even further (Haas, 2007b).  
Indeed, the globalization of financial markets, technological innovation, and the desire for international 
diversification of portfolios have already led market operators to consolidate or intensify collaboration, 
especially in small and medium-sized markets. For example, the merger of the Nordic-Baltic exchanges has 
created the regional OMX Market. The Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) signed an agreement with the 
multinational exchange Euronext that allows WSE members access to Euronext products and vice versa, 
and enables dealers to trade products from each exchange on a single screen. In 2004 the Vienna Stock 
Exchange acquired a stake in the Budapest Stock Exch
ange and entered into an index cooperation project 
with it.2Although the consolidation process typically takes a few years, the examples of OMX and others 
offer useful experience. However, because exchanges ar
e largely private sector owned, there are obvious 
limits to how much policymakers can drive the process or set the timetable. 
Even though many of the original reasons for having national exchanges have been weakened by EU 
integration, as well as by the associated regulato
ry convergence, combined with improvements in 
information technology and general financial market globalization, authorities may still be concerned that 
small and medium-sized firms are unlikely to be able to list overseas and may find it difficult to raise capital 
in local stock markets amid declining market activity. 
Thus, perhaps the most fruitful approach may be to 
concentrate on further improvements in, and homogenization of, the legal and institutional framework in 
these countries to facilitate smaller companies™ access to venture capital or private equity firms, commercial 
banks, or nonbank financial institutions, and possibly second-tier listing at a regional exchange.

Financial Development in Non-EU 
Countries: Priority Reforms 
Reinforcing the foundations  Attaining low inflation in a durable manner will 
be critical for financial development. While all 
economies have made great progress toward price 

stability, a few still need to address the threat of 

high and volatile inflation. Belarus, Russia, Serbia, and Turkey experienced double-digit inflation, on 
average, during 2003Œ06, and inflation in Moldova and Ukraine is likely to be more than 10 percent in 

2007. Non-EU emerging European economies have 
also made significant progress in protecting 

property rights, creating high-quality bureaucracy, 
controlling corruption, and establishing the rule of 
law. Nevertheless, institutional quality and law 
 Sustaining Financial Development in Emerging Europe 
55enforceability need to be brought closer to the EU 
average (Figure 40). Enforcing contracts needs to 

be made less costly and time-consuming by 

improving the efficiency of court systems and 

unburdening the judicial processes.
31 Non-EU emerging economies have also taken 

major steps to develop a sound and efficient 
banking sector. Indeed, only Belarus has yet to 

liberalize interest rates and credit allocation 

(Figure 44). All countries in this group have 

functioning payments and settlement systems, put 
in place fairly good accounting and disclosure 
standards, and established frameworks for bank 

prudential supervision and regulation broadly in 

line with international standards (Figure 45).  
 However, weaknesses in implementation of 
written rules and regulations need to be addressed 
to minimize risks to financial stability. For 
example, Moldova could benefit by improving the 

transparency of the ownership structure of its 

banks to secure full enforcement of prudential 

limits for connected lending and large exposures. 

Further reforms would also be desirable in the 
areas of bank regulation and supervision. In 

Russia, risks could be reduced by tightening the 
regulation and enforcement of large exposure 
limits and connected lending. In Bosnia, unifying 
bank supervision into a single, independent 

country-wide agency is necessary for effective 

supervision. In Belarus, the banking supervisor 

should shed its shareholdings in banking 

institutions to limit actual or apparent conflicts of 

interest.Building the government securities market A well-functioning government securities

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
56Box 9. Developing the Government Securities Market 
Hungary™s Success . . . 
Hungary™s government securities market is one of the most developed, liquid, and sophisticated markets in 
the region. The driving force behind the development of this market was the authorities™ commitment to a 
coherent strategy involving macroeconomic stabilization, the creation of a suitable legal and regulatory 
environment, the use of government securities 
for monetary operations, and improvements in debt 
management. Gradual capital account liberalization also 
helped make the market deeper and more liquid.  
The first steps in market development were taken in the early 1990s with the liberalization of interest rates 
and the enactment of the Central Bank Act, which laid the foundation for the complete phaseout of central 
bank deficit financing. In 1993, the non-interest-bearing public debt was swapped into marketable 
government bonds. Throughout the 1990s, the monetary authorities gradually adopted indirect instruments 
of monetary policy. Government securities began to be used as collateral in central bank refinancing 
activities with financial institutions and for open market operations, which helped make the government 
securities market deeper, more liquid, and attractive to investors.  
In the early 1990s, new legislation on securities, as well as the establishment of the Securities Supervisory 
Agency,
1the Central Clearing House and Depository, the Treasury, and the Government Debt Management 
Agency, paved the way for the smooth operation of the government securities market. Measures to 
encourage the emergence of institutional investors broadened the investor base. Legislation on mutual and 
pension funds also took effect in the early 1990s. A mandatory funded pillar was introduced with the 1998 
pension reform. Long-term local currencyŒdenominated gove
rnment securities were also made available to 
nonresidents in 1994.  
In 1995, the authorities demonstrated their commitment to macroeconomic stability by implementing a 
stabilization package in response to widening budget and current account deficits. Fiscal adjustment, a one-
time devaluation of the forint, and a shift from an adjustable fixed exchange rate to a crawling band with a 
preannounced devaluation rate formed the basis for sounder macroeconomic development and greater 
investor
confidence. As the anti-inflationary commitment of the monetary authorities gained credibility, 
helped by the adoption of an inflation-targeting framework, the yield curve could be extended significantly.  
Since the mid-1990s, debt-management strategies have been implemented with a view to enhancing the 
functioning of the primary market and increasing transparency and liquidity in the secondary market. A 
system of primary dealers was launched in 1996. Debt instruments were standardized to reduce 
fragmentation. Benchmark securities were introduc
ed, and their yields started being published daily. 
Liquidity in the secondary market was further enhanced by the liberalization of the capital account, 
culminating in 2001 with the removal of all foreign exchange restrictions, including those on short-term 
portfolio transactions. . . . Can It Be Transferred to Ukraine? 
Ukraine™s government securities market has so far remained shallow and illiquid. Marketable securities
amounted to just over 2.1 percent of GDP at end-2006. The term structure of government securities is very 
fragmented, leaving several gaps in the yield curve.  
Note: This box is based largely on Csajbók 
and Neményi (1998) and Arvai and Heenan (2005). 
1The Securities Supervisory Agency later became 
the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority.
 Sustaining Financial Development in Emerging Europe 
57Developing a deep and liquid government securities market will require a strong commitment by the 
authorities to an integrated and credible debt mana
gement and market development strategy. The primary 
market could be fostered by conducting regular 
auctions under transparent rules and according to a 
preannounced issuance program, creating a small number of liquid benchmarks, and issuing securities in 
sufficient size to achieve adequate liquidity in the secondary market. The price-setting mechanism at the 
auctions will need to be modified to ensure that yields are not kept artificially low but, rather, reflect market-
based outcomes. Discontinuing the use of private placements of government debts would also be beneficial. 
In addition, it would be useful to deepen the cooperation between the central bank and the ministry of 
finance including by defining the role of the central bank in the secondary market. Moreover, using 
government securities for monetary operations would strengthen market liquidity. 
Achieving and maintaining low inflation will be essential because inflationary expectations affect the 
government™s ability to extend the yield curve beyond very short maturities. This is particularly critical for 
Ukraine, because inflation has been volatile and above the levels observed in neighboring countries. 
Furthermore, the development of the government securities market could be enhanced by broadening the 
investor base and introducing a system of primary de
alers once a clear debt management strategy has been 
developed and the level of primary issuances increased. 
facilitates the pricing of other financial 
instruments, including corporate bonds and 

derivatives. In Ukraine, for example, the pricing of 

corporate securities would be greatly facilitated by 

the establishment of a yield curve for government 

bonds. Moreover, government securities can be 

used as collateral to reduce credit risk and as 
relatively safe assets to resort to during periods of 
heightened uncertainty. Also, building the 

government securities market entails the creation 

of an extensive legal, informational, and 

institutional infrastructure that can benefit the 

entire financial system. Developing a government securities market 
requires the joint commitment of the government 

and the central bank to a coherent strategy. Such a 

strategy would involve regular issuance of 

securities; central bank use of government paper 

for monetary policy operations to enhance 

liquidity; public debt management practices to 

create clear benchmarks for different maturities; 

and adequate market infrastructure, including 
trading, depository, and settlement systems. 
Hungary, for instance, successfully implemented a 
consistent and integrated approach that helped  
establish a deep and liquid government securities market. Other countries, like Ukraine, for 

example, would benefit from a strong 

commitment to build a government securities 

market (Box 9). 
Developing corporate finance  Stronger creditor pr
otection and corporate governance are essential to establish credit and 

corporate securities markets. The institutional and 

legal frameworks governing the valuation of 

collateral and the protection of creditor rights 
need to be improved, particularly in Belarus, 
Russia, and Turkey (Figure 41). Accessibility and 

quality of credit information through credit 

registries could also be enhanced, especially in 

Albania, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine (Figure 

42). For corporate governance, progress is needed, 

especially in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 

Ukraine (Figure 43). Adequate securities 

legislation has yet to be put in place in Albania and 
Belarus. Again, Ukraine provides a good case 
study of how enhancing institutional quality and 

corporate governance can help develop corporate 

finance (Box 10).
REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE 
58Expanding the range of players in the financial system  Creating a diverse class of institutional 
investors (including pension funds, mutual funds, 

and insurance companies) would greatly 
contribute to financial market development and 
liquidity. These investors would provide a stable 

source of demand for financial instruments, and 
stimulate competition and efficiency in primary 

markets. The emergence of institutional investors 

can be fostered by enhancing the regulatory and 

supervisory framework for nonbank financial 
institutions. The supervisory framework could 
take the form of an in
tegrated supervisory agency or several agencies, provided that cooperation and 
information flows were secured. In countries that 
have not yet reformed their pension systems, such 

as Albania and Belarus, consideration could be 

given to mandatory or voluntary fully funded 

schemes that could contribute to pension fund 

development. The case of Hungary offers an 

example of how legislative and regulatory changes, 

as well as pension reforms, can expand the range 

of institutional investors (Box 9).
Box 10. Institutional Quality, Corporate Governance, and Financial Development: The 
Case of Ukraine The Ukrainian corporate debt securities market has grown dramatically in recent years. Corporate debt 
securities issuance revived in 2001Œ02, and has accelerated since 2005. In 2006, total issues amounted to 4.1 
percent of GDP. However, market liquidity is rather low. The emergence of the market has been 
encouraged by the increased funding needs of Ukrain
ian companies, coupled with weaknesses in banking 
sector intermediation, including the limited capacity to fulfill corporates™ long-term funding needs owing to 
the scarcity of long-term hryvnia funds for banks, wide interest rate spreads, and the lack of domestic 
syndicated lending.  
In addition, the equity market has grown considerably in the past few years. Market capitalization reached 
40.4 percent of GDP in 2006, up from less than 4 percent in 1999. However, the number of listed 
companies is very small, and concentration rather high; the 10 largest companies account for 68 percent of 
total market capitalization. Moreover, the free float is small (about 5 percent of market capitalization), and 
market turnover extremely low (see Figure 37 in the main text). 
A number of reforms could support further healthy development of the corporate debt and equity securities 
market. First, institutional quality and law enforceability need to be strengthened, as court proceedings are 
generally cumbersome and lengthy (see Figure 40 in the main text). It would be important to also reinforce 
corporate governance, because at present the quality of the legislation defining the responsibilities of the 
board, the rights of shareholders, and disclosure an
d transparency are below international standards (see 
Figure 43 in the main text). Deficiencies could be addressed in the area of securities market regulation and 
supervision, as well as in the clearing and settlement 
system. The trading and registrar systems could also be 
upgraded. Creating a benchmark yield curve on government securities would facilitate corporate bond 
pricing. Enacting a joint stock company law would help equity market development.
1 Furthermore, the 
institutional investor base for the securities market
 could be enhanced through legal, regulatory, and 
supervisory reforms favoring mutual funds development and by expediting pension reform, which could 
boost the emergence of pension funds.
