10ECB Annual Report2007When looking back at the events of the last year, the third enlargement of the euro area since 
its creation in 1999 stands out as an important 
event. Implementing the decision made in 2007, 
on 1 January 2008 Cyprus and Malta became 
the 14th and 15th EU Member States to adopt 
the euro, following Greece in 2001 and Slovenia 
in 2007, and their national central banks (NCBs) 
joined the Eurosystem. I would like to extend a 
very warm welcome to the Cypriot and Maltese 
citizens. The good economic performance of 
Cyprus and Malta, thanks to the implementation 
of stability-oriented macroeconomic policies 
over recent years, made it possible for these 
two countries to introduce the euro as their 
currency. The currency changeover to the euro 
proceeded in a smooth and efÞ cient manner 
in both countries. Looking ahead, the main 
policy challenge for both countries following 
their adoption of the euro will be to ensure 
the conduct of appropriate national economic 
policies in order to secure a high degree of 
sustainable convergence.Another important event in 2007 was the signing by the Heads of State or Government of the EU™s new Treaty in Lisbon on 13 December. 
This Treaty is now in the process of being 
ratiÞ ed by all 27 Member States with a view to it 
entering into force on 1 January 2009. The ECB 
welcomes the fact that the new Treaty states that 
price stability is an objective of the EU, while 
making Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), 
with the euro as its currency, an EU objective. 
The ECB becomes a Union institution and the 
new Treaty conÞ rms the independence of the 
ECB, of the ESCB and of the NCBs, as well 
as the legal personality, regulatory powers and 
Þ nancial independence of the ECB. The ECB 
considers that the new Treaty conÞ rms the 
current set-up of EMU and is looking forward 
to the successful completion of the ratiÞ cation process.***In 2007 annual HICP inß ation in the euro 
area was 2.1%, compared with 2.2% in 2006. 
While this exceeded the ECB™s deÞ nition of 
price stability of ﬁbelow, but close to, 2%ﬂ, the 
ECB™s monetary policy nonetheless continued 
to Þ rmly anchor medium to long-term in
ß ation expectations at levels broadly consistent with 
price stability, notwithstanding an economic 
environment characterised by signiÞ cant upward 
price pressures. These mainly stemmed from 
increases in commodity prices, in particular 
energy and Œ particularly in the fourth quarter Œ 
food prices, as well as, on the domestic side, the 
impact of increases in indirect taxes, capacity 
constraints in the context of an expanding 
economy and tightening labour markets. The 
continued anchoring of inß ation expectations 
at medium and longer-term horizons in 2007 
therefore reß ects favourably on the credibility 
of the ECB in delivering price stability over the 
medium term, in line with its mandate. Such 
anchoring is an indispensable precondition for 
well-functioning markets, sustainable growth 
and job creation in the euro area and is of the 
highest priority to the Governing Council.Throughout 2007 risks to price stability over the medium term were clearly on the upside. 
The risks included possible additional rises 11ECB Annual Report2007in oil and agricultural prices and potential unforeseen increases in administered prices and 
indirect taxes. More fundamentally, there were 
substantial risks of increases in the pricing power 
of Þ rms, especially in market segments with low 
competition, and of stronger than expected wage 
dynamics, implying a threat of second-round 
effects stemming from temporarily elevated 
inß ation rates on wage and price-setting. In 
order to ensure that price stability was preserved 
over the medium term, the Governing Council 
monitored wage negotiations and price-setting 
in the euro area with particular attention.Economic activity in the euro area continued to expand at solid rates in 2007, with annual 
real GDP growing by 2.6%, despite volatile 
energy prices and an environment of heightened 
uncertainty stemming from the Þ nancial turmoil 
in the second half of the year. While euro area 
exports continued to beneÞ t from strong but 
moderating global economic growth, domestic 
demand Œ in particular the Þ xed investment 
component Œ remained the main driver of the 
expansion of economic activity. During the Þ rst half of 2007, strong investment growth was 
supported by favourable Þ nancing conditions, 
strong corporate earnings and further gains in 
business efÞ ciency. In the second half of 2007, 
the heightened Þ nancial uncertainty partly 
clouded the situation in the real economy and 
the balance of risks to the baseline scenario for 
euro area growth tilted to the downside.Cross-checking with the monetary analysis conÞ rmed the Governing Council™s assessment 
that risks to price stability continued to lie 
clearly on the upside at medium to longer 
horizons. A broad-based assessment of available 
data conÞ rmed that the underlying rate of 
money and credit expansion was very vigorous. 
In the second half of 2007, the inß uence of the 
Þ nancial turmoil on the underlying dynamics 
of broad money and credit expansion remained 
limited. This was underlined in particular 
by the sustained growth of bank loans to the 
domestic private sector, especially to non-
Þ nancial corporations, suggesting that the credit 
supply had not been signiÞ cantly impaired. The Governing Council paid particular attention to 
monetary developments over this period.In order to contain the prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term, the 
Governing Council raised the key ECB interest 
rates in March and June 2007 by 25 basis points 
in each case. As a result, the minimum bid 
rate in the main reÞ nancing operations of the 
Eurosystem rose to 4.00% in June 2007, from 
3.50% at the end of 2006. In the second half 
of the year, the Governing Council decided to 
maintain key ECB interest rates at an unchanged 
level. Taking due account also of the unusually 
high degree of uncertainty about the impact 
of the Þ nancial turmoil on the real economy, 
the Governing Council deemed it necessary to 
collect and assess additional information and 
to monitor developments in Þ nancial markets 
particularly closely before drawing further 
conclusions for monetary policy. At the same 
time, the Governing Council conÞ rmed its 
permanent readiness to do whatever was needed 
in order to ensure that upside risks to price 
stability would not materialise and that the Þ rm anchoring of long-term inß ation expectations 
would be preserved. ***Further progress with Þ scal consolidation was 
made in 2007, according to the updated stability 
programmes, with the average Þ scal de
Þ cit ratio for the euro area declining to 0.8% of 
GDP, compared with 1.5% in 2006. However, a 
renewed increase in this ratio is already projected 
for 2008 at a time when many countries have still 
not achieved sound Þ scal positions. This implies a 
risk that some countries will not comply with the 
provisions of the preventive arm of the Stability 
and Growth Pact. In order not to undermine the 
credibility of the Pact, these countries should 
pursue much more ambitious policies and 
improve their structural position by a benchmark 
rate of 0.5% of GDP per year as required by 
the Pact. It is crucial that all countries live up 
to their commitments and aim to achieve their 
medium-term objective of a sound Þ scal position 
by 2010 at the latest, as agreed and announced at 12ECB Annual Report2007the Eurogroup™s Berlin meeting of April 2007. Discretionary Þ scal loosening would be totally 
inappropriate. On the contrary, allowing the free 
operation of automatic stabilisers in countries 
with sound budgetary positions and safeguarding 
the long-term sustainability of public Þ nances is 
the best contribution Þ scal policy can make to 
macroeconomic stability.As regards structural reforms, recent achievements in the context of the Lisbon 
strategy are encouraging. Structural reforms and 
wage moderation over recent years have led to a 
signiÞ cant rise in employment in the euro area 
of around 15.8 million persons in the period 
of nine years since the start of Stage Three of 
EMU, compared with an increase of around
4.5 million for the same group of countries in 
the nine years before 1999. In the same vein, the 
unemployment rate in the euro area continued 
to decline, from 8.3% in 2006 to 7.4% in 2007, 
a level not seen for 25 years. However, there is 
no room for complacency. Unemployment rates 
in many countries are still high and the labour 
participation rate remains low by international 
standards. Moreover, productivity growth in 
the euro area continues to be weak, limiting the 
scope for wage increases. It is thus important that 
governments continue to sustain momentum and 
step up their reform efforts to remove remaining 
barriers to job creation and productivity growth. 
Most importantly, this requires improvements in 
education and life-long learning, which would 
enhance human capital, improve employment 
prospects and increase innovation. Continuous 
efforts are also needed to enhance competition 
and ß exibility and to improve the functioning 
of labour, product and services markets. 
In particular, enhancing competition in the 
services sectors and network industries, as 
well as applying adequate measures in the EU 
agricultural market, would support productivity 
growth and price stability in the euro area.***2007 was marked by very difÞ cult challenges 
in Þ nancial markets. As of August, a very 
signiÞ cant worldwide market correction with 
episodes of acute turbulence and a high level 
of volatility affected euro money markets. The 
drying-up of liquidity in the euro money market 
on 9 August led the ECB to provide •95 billion at 
its policy rate of 4.00% with overnight maturity. 
The ECB conducted further similar operations, 
of decreasing amounts, over the following days. 
In the subsequent weeks and months, the ECB 
also conducted supplementary longer-term 
reÞ nancing operations as well as 
Þ ne-tuning operations. It also provided liquidity in dollars 
in parallel with the Term Auction Facility of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At the 
end of the year, the ECB took special liquidity 
measures in order to accommodate the speciÞ c needs of the banking system.As a result of the ECB™s operations, the overnight interest rate returned to the stable levels around 
the policy rate set by the Governing Council 
which had prevailed before the start of the 
turmoil. Tensions remain, however, at longer 
maturities in the money market.The Þ nancial market correction triggered 
a substantial reappraisal of risk by market participants. The ECB, as well as the other 
members of the Eurosystem, had warned on 
several occasions, in particular in its Financial 
Stability Review, that the situation was 
characterised by an underpricing of risks. While 
the present signiÞ cant market correction is not 
over, some provisional lessons can be drawn, 
including: i) the necessity for banks to enhance 
their risk management systems; ii) the need to 
reß ect on the advantages and disadvantages of 
the ﬁoriginate-to-distribute modelﬂ developed 
before the correction started; iii) the need 
for enhanced transparency from all actors in 
the markets; iv) the need to assess the overall 
role of credit rating agencies; and v) the need 
for supervisors to implement the new capital 
framework under Basel II as rapidly and 
effectively as possible and to reß ect on possible 
enhancements to the supervisory regime for 
liquidity risk. The euro area Þ nancial system remained resilient 
in 2007, but its shock-absorbing capacity was 13ECB Annual Report2007severely tested throughout the second half of the year. Apart from the possible consequences of 
the credit market turbulence, future risks to the 
euro area banking system mainly relate to the 
possibility of adverse developments in the credit 
cycle, with negative implications for banks™ 
asset quality and loan impairment charges. 
In addition, the possibility of a disorderly 
unwinding of global imbalances remains a 
source of medium-term risk to global Þ nancial stability. ***During 2007 the ECB continued to make an 
active contribution to the process of European 
Þ nancial integration. In addition to monitoring 
progress in this Þ eld and providing advice on 
relevant legislation and regulation, the ECB 
conÞ rmed its role as a catalyst for private 
sector activities, in particular by continuing its 
strong support for the Single Euro Payments 
Area initiative. The Eurosystem maintained 
a constant dialogue with banks and other 
stakeholders and intensiÞ ed coordination efforts 
with the European Commission. It supported 
the adoption of the Payment Services Directive, 
which was approved by the EU Council on
15 October 2007.Furthermore, the TARGET2 system started operating on 19 November 2007, when a Þ rst group of eight countries migrated their operations 
to the single shared platform. A second group 
of seven countries migrated on 18 February this 
year, and the third group will migrate on 19 
May. With a view to reaping the full beneÞ ts of TARGET2, the Eurosystem continued to 
explore the possibility of offering a new service, 
called TARGET2-Securities (T2S), to provide 
a common technical infrastructure for the euro 
settlement of securities transactions in central 
bank money by central securities depositories and 
to process both securities and cash settlements 
on a single technical platform. With T2S, there 
would be no difference between conducting 
domestic and cross-border settlements within 
the euro area. It should therefore contribute
to integrating and harmonising Europeanpost-trading Þ nancial services and should foster competition by providing equal, cheaper and 
harmonised access to settlement services within 
the European Þ nancial market.
***The total number of budgeted staff positions 
for 2007 was 1,348 full-time equivalent (FTE) 
positions. This compares with 1,343 FTE 
positions for 2006. Following the introduction 
in 2006 of general principles for mobility which 
encourage members of staff to change positions 
after every Þ ve years of service, internal mobility 
has received considerable support. In total, 152 
members of staff, including 31 managers and 
advisers, moved internally to other positions 
in 2007, on either a temporary or a long-term 
basis.In addition to promoting mobility, the Human Resources (HR) strategy continued to focus on 
the development of ECB management and, in 
particular, on strengthening managerial skills 
through training and individual coaching. The 
continuous acquisition and development of 
skills and competencies by all members of staff 
remains a cornerstone of the ECB™s HR strategy. 
In addition to numerous in-house training 
opportunities, staff continued to take up external

and team spirit among Eurosystem/ESCB

development in 2007, including opportunities for 
ESCB training activities and the development of 
measures to increase intra-ESCB mobility.***2007 saw the completion of the detailed

October, the ECB selected some companies and

DEVELOPMENTS ANDMONETARY POLICY
18ECBAnnual Report
2007In 2007 the ECB conducted its monetary policy in an environment of sound economic growth 
and vigorous money and credit expansion 
in the euro area. Throughout the year, the
medium-term risks to price stability remained 
clearly on the upside, as identiÞ ed by the 
Governing Council™s regular economic and 
monetary analyses. To contain these risks, the 
Governing Council continued to adjust the 
monetary policy stance, raising the key ECB 
interest rates by a total of 50 basis points in 
March and June. As a result, the minimum bid 
rate in the main reÞ nancing operations of the 
Eurosystem rose to 4.00% in June 2007.Following the onset of the turmoil and 
increased volatility in Þ nancial markets in early 
August 2007, which had been triggered by a 

deterioration in the US sub-prime mortgage 

market and the repricing of risk, the outlook 

for economic activity in the euro area became
clouded by unusually high uncertainty. 

Notwithstanding the conÞ rmation of upside 
risks to price stability over the medium term, it 

was necessary in this environment of heightened 

uncertainty to collect and assess further 
information before drawing conclusions for 
monetary policy. The Governing Council therefore 
left the key ECB interest rates unchanged in
the second half of the year (see Chart 1).Average annual HICP inß ation stood at 2.1%
in 2007, compared with 2.2% in 2006. Headline inß ation ß uctuated signi
Þ cantly in the course of 
the year, largely on account of developments in 
energy prices. Until the third quarter of 2007, 
annual HICP inß ation developed in line with the 
ECB™s deÞ nition of price stability (i.e. below, 
but close to, 2% over the medium term), partly 
as a result of favourable base effects stemming 
from energy price developments a year earlier. 
Towards the end of the year, by contrast, 
annual inß ation rose sharply, reaching levels 
signiÞ cantly above 2%. The rise was mainly 
due to substantial increases in international oil
and food prices in the second half of 2007, which 1 MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS

2007were ampliÞ ed by unfavourable base effects 
stemming from the decline in energy prices in the last quarter of 2006. At the same time, 
wage developments remained rather moderate 
throughout 2007, despite an environment of 
robust economic growth, emerging capacity 
constraints and tightening labour markets. While 
longer-term inß ation expectations derived from 
surveys remained anchored at levels consistent 
with price stability, break-even inß ation rates 
derived from bond yields, which include an 
inß ation risk premium, rose slightly. Overall, 
risks to price stability over the medium term 
remained clearly on the upside. These risks 
included: the scope for additional rises in prices 
of oil and agricultural products; unforeseen 
increases in administered prices and indirect 
taxes; and the possibility of increases in Þ rms™ pricing power, particularly in sectors sheltered 
from competition. More fundamentally, the 
possible emergence of stronger than expected 
wage dynamics and, in particular, of second-
round effects in wage and price-setting as 
a consequence of higher commodity prices 
and elevated headline inß ation rates posed 
substantial upside risks to price stability.Economic activity in the euro area continued to expand at solid rates throughout 2007. 
While euro area exports continued to beneÞ t from strong, albeit moderating, global growth, 
domestic demand was the main driver of the 
continued expansion. Investment remained 
dynamic over the year, supported by favourable 
Þ nancing conditions (especially in the 
Þ rst half), strong corporate earnings and continued 
gains in business efÞ ciency on account of 
restructuring in the corporate sector over an 
extended period of time. Consumption also 
continued to contribute to economic expansion 
in the euro area, supported by developments 
in real disposable income, as labour market 
conditions continued to improve. In the context 
of the Þ nancial turmoil that started in early 
August 2007, the prospects for economic 
activity became more uncertain and downside 
risks to growth intensiÞ ed. Nevertheless, 
the economic fundamentals of the euro area 
remained sound, with corporate proÞ tability sustained, household balance sheets strong, 
employment growth robust and unemployment 
rates declining from 8.2% in 2006 to 7.4% in 
2007, which was the lowest level for 25 years. 
Overall, notwithstanding the challenges posed by 
volatile energy prices and Þ nancial turbulence, 
real GDP in the euro area grew by 2.6% on 
an annual basis in 2007. While short-term 
risks to the outlook for economic growth were 
broadly balanced for most of the year, longer-
term risks remained on the downside. These 
risks mainly related to external developments, 
notably possible further rises in oil and other 
commodity prices, global imbalances and 
potential protectionist pressures. After the 
onset of the Þ nancial turmoil, downside risks to 
growth intensiÞ ed, given the potential impact 
of the reappraisal of risk in Þ nancial markets on 
Þ nancing conditions, economic sentiment and 
the global environment. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis 
conÞ rmed that upside risks to price stability 
prevailed at medium to longer horizons. 
Money and credit continued to grow vigorously 
throughout 2007. Although a number of 
temporary factors (such as the ß attening of the 
yield curve and, later in the year, the Þ nancial turmoil and speciÞ c transactions associated with 
the restructuring of certain banking groups) 
inß uenced developments in the broad aggregate M3, a broad-based assessment of the data 
conÞ rmed the strength of the underlying rate 
of money and credit expansion, as underlined, 
in particular, by the sustained growth of loans 
to the private sector. The Governing Council 
therefore paid particular attention to monetary 
developments, also with a view to better 
understanding the shorter-term response of 
Þ nancial institutions, households and 
Þ rms to 
the Þ nancial market turmoil in the second half 
of 2007.To address the prevailing upside risks to price stability identiÞ ed by both its economic and  
monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
decided in March and June 2007 to raise the 
key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points in 20ECBAnnual Report
2007each case. Following the onset of the Þ nancial turmoil in early August 2007, the prospects for economic activity in the euro area were subject 
to higher than usual uncertainty in the face of 
the increased volatility and the repricing of risk 
in Þ nancial markets. Against this background, 
and notwithstanding the assessment that risks to 
price stability over the medium term remained 
clearly on the upside, the Governing Council 
deemed it appropriate to collect additional 
information and to carefully examine incoming 
data before drawing further monetary policy 
conclusions. With due consideration of the 
heightened level of uncertainty, the Governing 
Council therefore left the key ECB interest rates 
unchanged in the second half of the year.In its communications to Þ nancial market 
participants and the general public, the Governing 
Council stressed that it would monitor all 

developments very closely, in particular those in 

Þ nancial markets. Furthermore, the Governing 
Council signalled its readiness to counter upside 

risks to price stability by acting in a Þ rm and 
timely manner to prevent second-round effects 

in wage and price-setting from materialising over 

the medium term. This would ensure that medium 

to long-term inß ation expectations remain 
Þ rmly 
anchored at levels consistent with price stability. 

Reß ecting the Governing Council™s mandate, such 
anchoring is an indispensable prerequisite for 
well-functioning markets, sustained economic 
growth and job creation.FURTHER ADJUSTMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY 

STANCE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2007At the start of the year, incoming information 
further underpinned the reasoning behind the 
interest rate increases implemented in 2006. In 
particular, the incoming data clearly conÞ rmed the view that risks to price stability remained on 
the upside, while economic activity in the euro 
area was continuing to expand robustly.With a quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2006, euro area real GDP 
growth exceeded earlier expectations. Strong 
contributions from domestic demand and exports 
were the main drivers of growth, pointing to the increasingly self-sustaining nature of the 
economic expansion. In addition, available 
conÞ dence indicators continued to support 
the Governing Council™s view that the robust 
economic growth dynamics had continued into 
early 2007. Moreover, the medium-term outlook 
for economic activity remained favourable, with 
conditions in place for the euro area economy 
to grow at a sustained pace, given robust 
global growth and dynamic investment growth 
in the euro area in a context of improving 
labour market conditions. In the ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections of March 2007, 
the ranges projected for economic growth were 
revised upwards in comparison with those in the 
Eurosystem staff projections of December 2006, 
largely reß ecting the continued strength of 
real GDP growth in the second half of 2006 
and lower energy prices, which were seen Œ if 
these developments were to be sustained Œ
to have a positive impact on real disposable 
income. Average annual real GDP growth 
was projected to be in a range between 2.1% 
and 2.9% in 2007, and between 1.9% and 2.9% 
in 2008.As regards price developments, annual HICP inß ation rates remained at 1.9% at the start of the 
year, and were thus consistent with the ECB™s 
deÞ nition of price stability. The fall in headline 
inß ation rates since the summer of 2006 was 
due predominantly to lower energy prices. In 
assessing the outlook for price developments, 
the Governing Council stressed the importance 
of taking a medium-term perspective and of 
looking beyond the possible volatility in inß ation rates in the course of 2007. In the ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections of March 2007, the 
upper bound of the range projected for inß ation in 2007 was somewhat lower than in the 
Eurosystem staff projections of December 2006, 
largely reß ecting the signi
Þ cant decline in oil 
prices. The projected range for inß ation in 2008, 
by contrast, was slightly higher than in the 
December projections, mainly as a result of the 
anticipation of stronger growth dynamics in the 
euro area that were likely to exert more intense 
pressure on factor utilisation and costs. Average 
annual HICP inß ation was projected to stand 
21ECBAnnual Report
2007between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2007, and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008. At the policy-relevant 
medium-term horizon, this outlook remained 
subject to upside risks.The outcome of the monetary analysis conÞ rmed the upside risks to price stability that had been identiÞ ed by the economic analysis. The 
continued robust expansion of money and credit 
in an environment of ample liquidity pointed to 
inß ationary risks at medium to longer horizons. 
At the beginning of 2007, annual M3 growth 
reached levels not seen since the introduction 
of the euro. Moreover, the annual rate of growth 
in loans to the private sector remained strong, 
largely reß ecting the continuation of the upward 
trend in the growth of borrowing by non-
Þ nancial corporations that had been recorded 
since mid-2004. At the same time, in the context 
of rising mortgage rates throughout the euro 
area and slowing housing markets in some 
regions, the growth of household borrowing 
showed signs of moderation, although at a 
high level. The monetary data thus conÞ rmed the persistent upward trend in the underlying 
rate of money and credit expansion that had 
been observed since mid-2004. The Governing 
Council therefore took the view that monetary 
developments continued to require very careful 
monitoring, especially in a context of sound 
economic expansion and persistently strong 
property market dynamics in the euro area.Overall, in view of the prevailing upside risks to price stability identiÞ ed by both the economic 
and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 
25 basis points on 8 March 2007. Furthermore, 
the Governing Council took the view that, even 
after the decision to further raise the key ECB 
interest rates, and given the favourable economic 
environment, the monetary policy of the ECB 
continued to be on the accommodative side.As regards economic activity, available data clearly conÞ rmed that the euro area economy 
was continuing to expand at a pace that was 
signiÞ cantly stronger than expected a year 
earlier. With a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.8%, real GDP in the Þ rst quarter of 2007 again 
somewhat exceeded previous expectations. 
Moreover, the medium-term outlook for 
economic activity remained favourable. This was 
reß ected by the Eurosystem staff projections of 
June 2007, which saw average annual real GDP 
growth as being within the upper band of the 
range projected by ECB staff in March. At the 
same time, the projected ranges for 2008 were 
revised marginally downwards after the increase 
in oil prices and with the balance of risks to the 
outlook at medium to longer horizons being 
considered to be on the downside.Moreover, the annual HICP inß ation rate stood 
at 1.9% in May, somewhat higher than expected earlier in 2007, as a result of higher oil prices. 
Given the upward path of oil prices implied 
by futures contracts, and viewed against the 
background of past energy price developments, 
annual inß ation rates were expected to fall only 
slightly in the ensuing months before rising 
signiÞ cantly towards the end of the year. In the 
Governing Council™s view, risks to the outlook 
for price developments remained on the upside 
at the medium-term horizon. These risks were 
in particular related to stronger than expected 
wage dynamics in an environment of increasing 
capacity utilisation and gradually improving 
labour markets.The monetary analysis continued to conÞ rm prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons, with the underlying 
rate of monetary expansion remaining vigorous 
in a context of already ample liquidity. This 
was reß ected in the continued rapid growth 
of both M3 and credit. At the same time, 
after looking through the factors affecting 
monetary and credit developments in the 
short term, there were increasing signs that
higher short-term interest rates were gradually 
inß uencing monetary dynamics, although they 
were still not dampening the underlying rate of 
monetary and credit expansion.All in all, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary 
analysis underpinned the Governing Council™s 22ECBAnnual Report
2007view that upside risks to price stability prevailed over the medium term. Against this background, 
the Governing Council decided to raise the key 
ECB interest rates by a further 25 basis points on 
6 June. On this occasion, the Governing Council 
stated that, even after this decision, the ECB™s 
monetary policy was still on the accommodative 
side. Therefore, it would be warranted to act 
in a Þ rm and timely manner to ensure price 
stability over the medium term. The Governing 
Council also made clear that it would monitor 
all developments closely to prevent the risks 
to price stability from materialising over the 
medium term.NO CHANGES TO KEY ECB INTEREST RATES IN 

THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 
In the course of the third quarter, incoming 
data on economic activity remained positive, 
supporting the view that the euro area economy 
was continuing to expand at sustained rates in 
line with the Governing Council™s baseline 
scenario. While quarter-on-quarter real GDP 
growth declined to 0.3% in the second quarter, 
after 0.8% in the Þ rst quarter, economic 
growth in the Þ rst half of the year, viewed as 
a whole, was in line with potential. Following 
the outbreak of the crisis in the US sub-prime 
mortgage loan market and the associated 
Þ nancial turmoil in August 2007, however, 
the prospects for economic activity in the euro 
area were subject to an unusually high level 
of uncertainty, which warranted the close 
monitoring of all developments, particularly 
those in Þ nancial markets.
In the ECB staff macroeconomic projections of 

September 2007, the range foreseen for real GDP 

growth in 2007 was 2.2% to 2.8%, implying a 

slight downward revision compared with that of 

the Eurosystem staff projections of June 2007. 

This was due mainly to the assumption of 
somewhat higher oil prices and somewhat tighter 
Þ nancing conditions, the latter re
ß ecting higher 
risk premia in the light of the Þ nancial turmoil.
For 2008, the projected range for economic 
growth remained between 1.8% and 2.8%, 
unchanged from that in the June 2007 
Eurosystem staff projections. The risks to these projections were deemed to lie on the downside, 
relating mainly to a potentially broader impact of 
the increased volatility and ongoing repricing of 
risk in Þ nancial markets on 
Þ nancing conditions 
and economic sentiment.As regards price developments, annual HICP inß ation stood at 1.7% in August, but over 
the remainder of the year, inß ation rates were 
projected to exceed 2%, largely determined by 
the pattern of base effects in energy prices. In 
the ECB staff projections of September 2007, 
annual HICP inß ation was projected to be 
between 1.9% and 2.1% in 2007, and between 
1.5% and 2.5% in 2008, as declining pressure 
from indirect taxes and energy prices was 
expected to be offset by pressures stemming 
from higher unit labour costs. In the view of the 
Governing Council, the risks to this outlook for 
price developments remained on the upside.The monetary analysis continued to conÞ rm this assessment, with the continued vigour of the underlying rate of monetary and credit 
expansion pointing to the existence of upside 
risks to price stability at medium to longer 
horizons. Against the background of the ongoing 
Þ nancial turmoil, the Governing Council 
recalled that volatility in Þ nancial markets could 
temporarily inß uence monetary dynamics, 
since Œ as demonstrated in previous episodes Œ 
changes in private sector attitudes towards risk 
could be associated with large portfolio shifts 
into safe and liquid monetary assets. Thus, the 
Governing Council was of the view that anin-depth and comprehensive analysis of monetary and credit data was needed to better understand 
the impact of Þ nancial developments on 
monetary developments and to extract the 
policy-relevant signals from monetary growth 
with regard to longer-term inß ationary trends.
Notwithstanding the prevalence of upside risks to 
price stability, as identiÞ ed by both its economic 
and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
took the view that, given the high level of 
uncertainty in the wake of the Þ nancial turmoil, additional information was needed before 
further conclusions for monetary policy could 23ECBAnnual Report
2007be drawn. Consequently, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates 
unchanged in the third quarter, while reafÞ rming that it would monitor all developments very 
closely, in particular those in Þ nancial markets, 
so as to ensure that risks to price stability did 
not materialise and that longer-term inß ation expectations remained Þ rmly anchored in line 
with price stability.In the fourth quarter incoming data supported the sustained nature of economic expansion in 
the euro area. Real GDP grew by 0.8%, quarter 
on quarter, in the third quarter of 2007, with 
domestic demand as the main driver. Moreover, 
available conÞ dence indicators, while declining 
somewhat in the context of the high volatility 
and the repricing of risk in Þ nancial markets 
since early August 2007, generally remained at 
levels that pointed to ongoing economic growth 
in the fourth quarter, albeit probably at a more 
moderate pace than in the third quarter. Overall, 
it was the assessment of the Governing Council 
that the economic fundamentals of the euro area 
remained sound, with proÞ tability sustained and 
employment growth robust. In December 2007 
Eurosystem staff projected real GDP growth 
to be in the range between 2.4% and 2.8% in 
2007, between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008, and 
between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2009. While the 
ranges projected for 2008 were revised slightly 
downwards, the new range for 2007 remained in 
the upper part of the previous one.Against this background, the Governing Council™s main scenario of real GDP growing 
around its trend potential remained in place 
in 2008 and 2009. On the domestic side, both 
consumption and investment were expected 
to contribute to economic expansion. At the 
same time, external demand was expected to 
continue to support euro area exports, provided 
that the global economy remained resilient, with 
the economic slowdown in the United States 
being partly offset by the sustained strength 
of emerging market economies. Prospects for 
economic growth in the euro area thus remained 
resilient, although the risks to this outlook 
remained on the downside. These risks related mainly to the potential impact of the ongoing 
Þ nancial turmoil on 
Þ nancing conditions and 
economic sentiment, with possible adverse 
effects on growth in the euro area and the 
world.On the price side, the annual rate of HICP inß ation reached levels above 3% at the turn of 
the year. Substantial increases in international 
oil and food prices, together with unfavourable 
base effects from energy prices, were the main 
factors driving this development. The Governing 
Council took the view that annual inß ation rates 
would remain signiÞ cantly above 2% in the 
Þ rst months of 2008, before moderating again 
over the course of 2008. Hence, the period of 
temporarily high rates of inß ation would be 
somewhat more protracted than previously 
expected.In December 2007 Eurosystem staff projected inß ation to rise to a range between 2.0% 
and 3.0% in 2008, before moderating to 
a range between 1.2% and 2.4% in 2009. 
Compared with the ECB staff projections of
September 2007, the range for 2008 was shifted 
upwards, largely reß ecting the assumed path of 
oil and food prices.On the money side, there was little evidence that the Þ nancial turmoil since August 2007 
had strongly inß uenced the dynamics of broad 
money and credit expansion. In fact, the growth 
of bank loans to the domestic private sector 
remained robust in the second half of 2007, 
suggesting that the supply of credit had not been 
impaired. Overall, a broad-based assessment of 
the monetary data supported the view that the 
underlying rate of money and credit expansion 
remained strong.With the prevalence of upside risks to price stability, especially in a context of existing 
capacity constraints and positive labour market 
developments, it was imperative to avoid the 
emergence of second-round effects on wage and 
price-setting from temporarily high inß ation rates, so as to ensure price stability over the 
medium term. As a consequence, the Governing 24ECBAnnual Report
2007Council re-emphasised that it was monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular 
attention. In addition, any scheme indexing 
nominal wages to the consumer price index 
should be avoided. Other upside risks related 
to further rises in oil and agricultural prices, in 
particular if they continued their upward trend 
observed in the last months of 2007, as well as 
to unanticipated increases in administered prices 
and indirect taxes.Against this background, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates 
unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2007. At 
the same time, it clearly communicated that 
the ECB™s monetary policy stood ready to act 
in a Þ rm and timely manner so as to counter 
upside risks to price stability, as required by its 
mandate under the Treaty. Readiness to act was 
seen as being warranted in order to ensure both 
that second-round effects from high inß ation rates and other risks to price stability did not 
materialise and that medium to long-term 
inß ation expectations remained 
Þ rmly anchored 
in line with price stability.25ECBAnnual Report
20072 MONETARY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS2.1 THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT 
GLOBAL GROWTH RESILIENT BUT SLOWING DOWN 
In 2007 global economic growth (outside the euro area) moderated somewhat from the very 
buoyant conditions recorded in the previous 
three years. This was partly related to the 
global Þ nancial tensions that surfaced in the 
middle of 2007 and overshadowed economic 
developments across the globe, as well as to a 
certain maturing of the global manufacturing 
cycle. While the US housing market weakness 
had only limited immediate spillover effects 
on other components of US domestic demand, 
which grew strongly in the second and third 
quarters of 2007, US economic growth slowed 
down markedly in the fourth quarter. The global 
repercussions of the weaker economic outlook 
in the United States, however, remained rather 
limited in 2007. In major emerging markets, 
the turmoil led temporarily to a rise in Þ nancial market volatility, but the capacity of most 
emerging markets to withstand this turbulence 
appeared to be stronger than in the past. Over 
the year as a whole, the economic expansion 
in emerging markets proceeded at a fast pace, 
particularly in emerging Asia. At the same time, 
uncertainty about the global economic outlook 
increased, associated with the broad-based 
reappraisal of risks, tighter Þ nancing conditions, 
the rise in commodity prices and a decline in 
conÞ dence indicators. 
Following a period of broadly contained 
global inß ationary pressures in the year to 
September 2007, headline inß ation in most 
economies rose strongly towards the end of 2007 
(see Chart 2). In the OECD countries, headline 
consumer price inß ation increased to 3.3% in 
December 2007. This was mainly attributable 
to higher commodity prices and unfavourable 
base effects. Amid tight market conditions, oil 
prices continued to rise strongly in the course 
of 2007. In addition, non-oil commodity prices 
continued to increase strongly in the Þ rst half of 
2007 and subsequently remained rather volatile 
at elevated levels. These latter developments 
reß ected a strong rise in agricultural prices, 
particularly food, which was only partly offset 
by a decline in metals prices. Agricultural prices 
continued to be affected by strong demand 
from emerging economies, developments in 
the production of biofuels and poor harvests in 
some countries. In view of the higher weight of 
food in their price index, inß ationary pressures 
have been even more pronounced in emerging 
markets than in industrialised countries. Chart 2 Main developments in major

2007Excluding food and energy, however, consumer price inß ation remained contained, standing at 
2.1% in December in the OECD countries.In the United States, the annual rate of growth 
in real GDP for 2007 as a whole was 2.2%, 

which was 0.7 percentage point below the rate in 

2006. The housing market correction, which had 

already begun in 2006, remained a major drag on 

growth and shaved almost a full percentage point 

off GDP growth through decreased residential 

investment. In addition, the sub-prime mortgage-
related Þ nancial market turbulence intensi
Þ ed 
from summer 2007 onwards, and contributed 

to curbing growth towards the end of the 

year. In the course of 2007 economic activity 

was volatile, with GDP growth falling below 

its potential rate in the Þ rst quarter, surging 
above it in the second and third quarters, and 

declining again in the fourth quarter. Amid this 

volatility, private consumption growth remained 

surprisingly strong, despite high energy prices 

and the housing and Þ nancial market turbulence, 
mainly owing to continued employment and 

income growth, which, however, deteriorated 

signiÞ cantly towards the end of the year. In 
addition, non-residential business investment 

growth was brisk, supported by high levels of 

corporate proÞ tability and, during the 
Þ rst half of 
the year, favourable Þ nancing conditions. The net 
trade contribution turned positive in 2007 for the 

Þ rst time since 1995, re
ß ecting buoyant global 
growth, as well as the depreciation of the real 

effective exchange rate of the US dollar. These 

factors also explain the decline in the current 

account deÞ cit from 6.2% of GDP in 2006 to 
5.5% in the Þ rst three quarters of 2007. The 
narrowing of the goods deÞ cit accounted for the 
bulk of the improvement.The Þ nancial market turbulence, which originated 
from increased delinquency and foreclosure 
rates for US sub-prime mortgages, heightened 

in the summer. However, its effects on the US 

real economy remained fairly limited during 

most of 2007 and were mainly related to the 

availability and price of loans, especially non-
conforming mortgages. Otherwise the turbulence 

was manifest mainly in money markets and in 
the Þ nancial sector, where banks had to make 
substantial write-downs.In the United States, the annual rate of change in the CPI for 2007 was 2.8%, down from 3.2% 
the year before. Consumer price inß ation rose in 
the Þ rst half of the year on account of signi
Þ cant increases in energy prices and an acceleration in 
the owner-equivalent rent component of the CPI. 
After being somewhat muted during the summer 
months, inß ationary pressures subsequently 
increased, with the year-on-year change in the 
CPI peaking at 4.3% in November. This was 
in particular attributable to strong base effects 
and increases in energy and food prices towards 
the end of the year. The annual rate of inß ation excluding energy and food also showed signs of 
renewed acceleration in the last months of the 
year. In 2007 as a whole, it stood at 2.3%, 0.2 
percentage point lower than in 2006.In the Þ rst half of 2007 the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve System kept the federal funds target rate 
unchanged at 5.25%. After the Þ nancial market 
turbulence began to heighten in late summer, 
the Federal Reserve made a series of rate cuts 
in September and October by a total of 75 basis 
points. After one additional 25 basis point cut 
made in December the target rate stood at 4.25% 
at the end of the year, a full percentage point 
below its January level. The Federal Reserve 
also used other monetary policy tools. In August 
it cut the spread between the federal funds and 
discount rates from 100 basis points to 50 basis 
points. On 12 December it announced additional 
changes to its monetary policy tools. The Federal 
Reserve established a temporary Term Auction 
Facility to auction term funds to depository 
institutions with longer maturities and looser 
collateral requirements than is the case in open 
market operations. At the same time it agreed on 
temporary liquidity-providing operations with 
the ECB and the Swiss National Bank to provide 
US dollars for use in their jurisdictions.As regards Þ scal policy, the federal budget de
Þ cit declined in the Þ scal year 2007 compared with 
2006. This was mainly the result of increased 27ECBAnnual Report
2007personal tax revenues and reduced outlays. According to estimates by the Congressional 
Budget OfÞ ce, the federal budget de
Þ cit stood 
at 1.2% of GDP in the Þ scal year 2007. 
In Japan, the economic recovery continued in 

2007, although domestic demand and in particular 

private consumption weakened. Growth in 

real activity moderated in 2007, with real GDP 

growing by 2.1% after 2.4% in 2006, remaining 

around potential for the fourth consecutive year. 

While economic activity remained supported by 

the continuing strength of exports, the contribution 

of domestic demand to GDP growth decreased. 

Export activity beneÞ ted from developments in 
the effective exchange rate of the Japanese yen 

and sound external demand, especially from 

Asia. Private consumption growth declined to 

1.4% after 2.0% in 2006, although employment 

conditions remained favourable overall. Moreover, 
despite export momentum, private investment 

growth slowed down. This reß ected a decrease in 
residential investment driven by a contraction in 

construction activity following the revision of the 

Building Standards Law, and a slowdown in non-
residential investment driven by some moderation 

in business conÞ dence, especially among small 
and medium-sized Þ rms. Despite moderating 
economic conditions, bank lending continued 

to increase in 2007, although at a slower pace 

than in 2006, amid increased uncertainties in the 

global Þ nancial environment.
Consumer price inß ation remained subdued in 
Japan in 2007, reß ecting in particular subdued 
wage growth. After being positive in 2006 in 

the wake of higher commodity prices, annual 

consumer price inß ation returned to negative 
territory at the beginning of 2007, before turning 

positive again in October as a result of the 

renewed increase in the price of imported raw 

materials. For the year as a whole, the annual 

rate of change in consumer prices was 0.0% after 

0.3% in 2006, while excluding fresh food the 

annual rate of inß ation was 0.0% after 0.1% in 
2006. In 2007 the Bank of Japan continued its 

policy of a very gradual tightening of monetary 

conditions, in line with subdued inß ationary 
pressures. For the second time since the end of 
the quantitative easing policy in March 2006, the 

Bank of Japan decided in February 2007 to raise 

its target for the uncollateralised overnight call 

rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. 
Growth in emerging economies remained solid 
and accounted for a signiÞ cant share of world 
GDP growth in 2007, as mature economies™ 

expansion weakened (see Chart 3). Some 

inß ationary pressure surfaced in a number of 
countries.Economic activity remained robust in emerging Asia. Notwithstanding a less favourable external 
environment in the second half of the year, strong 
domestic demand helped to support the growth 
momentum, notably in the largest economies 
of the region. Inß ationary pressures remained 
contained in most economies owing, in part, to 
the tightening in monetary policy implemented 
in many economies. One exception was China, 
where inß ation rose during the year. Re
ß ecting the region™s solid macroeconomic performance, 
valuations in local equity markets continued 
to rise amid large ß uctuations. Developments 
appeared to be more mixed in foreign exchange 
markets. Some emerging Asian currencies 
Œ such as the Thai baht or the Indian rupee Œ 
appreciated substantially in effective terms Chart 3 Geographical contributions to world

2007on the back of strong capital inß ows, while 
other currencies remained broadly stable or depreciated in effective terms.Focusing on China, the economy continued to expand briskly last year. Real GDP grew 
by 11.4% in 2007, up from 11.1% in 2006, on 
account of both sustained domestic demand and 
strong net exports. Inß ationary pressures picked 
up, with CPI inß ation increasing from 2.2% in 
January to 6.5% in December, largely driven 
by higher food prices. The Chinese renminbi 
continued to appreciate gradually against 
the US dollar throughout the year, although 
movements in effective terms were more 
subdued. In May the People™s Bank of China 
announced a widening of the daily trading 
band of the renminbi exchange rate against the
US dollar from +/-0.3% of the reference rate to 
+/-0.5%. The trade surplus continued to widen, 
bringing the cumulated surplus in 2007 to
USD 262 billion Œ or about 8% of GDP Œ almost 
50% higher than the surplus for the whole of 
2006. In this context, foreign exchange reserves 
continued to rise, totalling USD 1.5 trillion, 
close to 50% of GDP, at the end of 2007.Economic growth also remained sustained in 
Latin America, albeit with some heterogeneity 

in the inß ation and growth performances 
across economies. Improved macroeconomic 

fundamentals, a further reduction in Þ nancial 
vulnerabilities, high commodity prices and 

strong domestic demand continued to support the 

economic outlook. External Þ nancial conditions 
deteriorated in the wake of the recent period of 

global Þ nancial market turbulence, albeit less 
than in previous episodes of market volatility. 

In particular, spreads on credit default swaps 

on Latin American sovereign debt widened, but 

remained at low levels by historical standards. 

In the region™s leading economies, the pace of 

economic activity was more moderate in Mexico, 

reß ecting a less favourable external environment, 
but was robust in Brazil, while inß ation remained 
contained in both countries. Argentina continued 

to post high real GDP growth rates, and inß ation 
remained at elevated levels.COMMODITY PRICE DEVELOPMENTS IN 2007Oil prices surged for the fourth year in a row 
in 2007. The price of Brent crude oil increased 
to around USD 95.6 per barrel in late November. 
Oil prices were subsequently volatile and stood at 

USD 94.9 per barrel at the end of the year, around 

USD 17 above the peaks reached in August 2006. 

Measured in terms of euro, prices were only 

around EUR 4 above the August 2006 peak and 

around 40% above the level of end-2006. For 
the year as a whole, the average price of a barrel 
of Brent crude oil was USD 71, which was 9% 
above the average of the previous year.Throughout the year oil markets remained tight. As regards supply, the Organization of 
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
had lowered its production quota and actual 
production towards the end of 2006, while non-
OPEC supply growth fell short of expectations 
and, thus, did not compensate for lower OPEC 
output. In addition, some production disruptions 
attributable to the hurricane season temporarily 
reduced output. Global demand growth 
remained relatively robust. Some weakness 
in OECD demand towards the end of the year 
was compensated for by robust non-OECD Chart 4 Main developments in commodity

2007demand growth. Demand in most non-OECD countries, in particular China, remained strong, 
reß ecting robust economic performance. In 
addition, oil demand was supported by subsidies 
on oil products in many of these countries. 
Inventories in both the United States and the 
OECD countries failed to build up before the 
northern hemisphere heating season, a period 
when inventories normally increase. The low 
level of oil inventories triggered concerns about 
the lack of a safety cushion against possible 
future supply disruptions (related to geopolitical 
tensions and extreme weather) at a time when 
oil market conditions were already tight. 
Towards the end of the year, prices became 
increasingly volatile as a result of changing 
market perceptions about a slowdown in the 
US and global economy and some unwinding 
of speculative activity. Prices stayed at high 
levels, however, as the International Energy 
Agency conÞ rmed the positive outlook for 
global oil demand in 2008 owing to strong 
non-OECD demand growth and hinted at 
possible lower rates of oil discovery over the 
next decade. Not only oil but also other commodity prices increased markedly in 2007. The prices of 
non-energy commodities, as measured by the 
Hamburg Institute of International Economics, 
continued to be buoyant in most of 2007 and 
peaked in mid-October amid some volatility. In 
the Þ rst half of the year non-energy commodity 
prices were supported both by strong increases 
in industrial raw materials prices and by 
surges in agricultural prices attributable to 
strong economic growth, bad harvests and the 
increased use of agricultural raw materials in 
the production of biofuel. In the second half 
of the year the upward trend in agricultural 
and food prices continued, mainly driven by 
robust demand from China, while industrial 
raw materials (and in particular non-ferrous 
metals) prices declined, reß ecting the slowdown 
in industrial production in OECD countries. 
In aggregate terms, non-energy commodity 
prices (denominated in US dollars) increased 
by an average of approximately 19% in 2007 
compared with the previous year.2.2 MONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
THE PACE OF MONETARY EXPANSION REMAINED 
STRONGThe year 2007 was again characterised by strong 
monetary and credit growth, following the 
strengthening observed since mid-2004. This 
strength is reß ected in the continued high growth 
rates of both the broad monetary aggregate M3 
and lending to the private sector (see Chart 5), 
which stood at 12.0% and 11.1% respectively in 
the fourth quarter of 2007. A broad-based analysis of monetary developments 
shows that the growth of M3 in 2007 may 

somewhat overstate the underlying rate of 

monetary expansion, owing to the stimulative 

effect of the relatively ß at yield curve, which 
increased the attractiveness of short-term MFI 

deposits relative to longer-term deposits and 

securities. Consequently, strong M3 growth may, 

to some extent, have been driven by speculative 

demand for monetary assets. At the same time, the 

increases in key ECB interest rates since December 

2005 have clearly continued to inß uence money 
and credit developments. The impact of these 

increases in short-term interest rates on monetary 

dynamics remained visible, for example, in the

2007moderation in the annual growth rates of both M1 
and loans to the household sector.Thus far, the Þ nancial turmoil observed as of 
the second half of 2007 appears to have had a 
limited impact on the dynamics of the broad 

monetary aggregate. The turmoil has, however, 

affected speciÞ c components and counterparts 
of M3, particularly those closely related to the 

tensions emerging in the money market, such as 

the issuance of money market fund shares/units 

and MFI debt securities. However, a more general 

shift into monetary assets, possibly triggered by a 

more widespread increase in risk aversion in the 

non-Þ nancial private sector in the context of that 
Þ nancial turmoil, does not Œ thus far, at least Œ 
appear to have occurred. This assessment is 

supported by the detailed analysis of components 

and counterparts of M3 reported below.COMPONENTS OF M3 WERE INFLUENCED BY THE 

FLAT YIELD CURVEOn the components side, the annual growth 
rate of M1 moderated further to stand at 4.1% 
at the end of 2007, well below the double-digit 
growth rates observed between 2003 and late 
2005 before the key ECB interest rates were 
increased. This moderation is visible in both 
components of M1, i.e. overnight deposits and 
currency in circulation. M1 growth in 2007 
was inß uenced mainly by two countervailing 
forces. On the one hand, there was a dampening 
effect resulting from the rising opportunity cost 
of holding M1 associated with the increases 
in interest rates since December 2005. On the 
other hand, there was greater transaction-related 
demand for M1 given the continued strength 
of economic activity, as well as, potentially, a 
desire to hold M1 as a buffer in the context of 
the recent Þ nancial turmoil.
The strengthening observed since mid-2004 in 
the annual growth rate of short-term deposits 
other than overnight deposits (M2-M1) continued 
in 2007, with that growth rate reaching 17.8% 
in December (see Chart 6). The contribution of 
these other short-term deposits to annual M3 
growth increased to 6.6 percentage points in 
December, with such deposits accounting for most of the strong overall monetary expansion 
as well as its recent dynamics. However, this 
strong growth masks divergent developments 
across the various sub-components. The ongoing 
strong inß ows for short-term time deposits 
(i.e. deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two 
years), which grew at an annual rate of 41.4% in 
December, up from 27.2% in December 2006, 
were accompanied by a continuous decline in the
holdings of deposits redeemable at notice of up 
to three months, which declined by 3.6% in the 
year to December, after low levels of growth at 
the end of 2006.The remuneration of short-term time deposits has broadly followed the rise in short-term 
money market interest rates (see Chart 7). The 
spread vis-à-vis the remuneration of short-term 
savings deposits and overnight deposits has thus 
widened, as the remuneration of these deposits 
has increased more slowly and modestly, in 
line with historical patterns. This has supported 
shifts into time deposits from M1 and savings 
deposits. Moreover, with a relatively ß at yield 
curve, short-term time deposits have been 
attractive by comparison with riskier longer-
maturity assets outside M3, since they offer 
greater liquidity and less risk at little cost in 
terms of return, thereby supporting shifts away 
from longer-term assets as well. Chart 6 Main components of M3(annual percentage changes; adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects)2007200620052004200320022420161284

M1Source: ECB.31ECBAnnual Report
2007Having already strengthened considerably in 2006, 
the annual growth rate of marketable instruments 

(M3-M2) increased further in the course of 2007, 

standing at 19.9% in December, up from 13.3% in 

December 2006. To a large extent, this reß ects the 
impact of the relatively ß at yield curve in the euro 
area, which encouraged shifts into shorter-term 

monetary assets. As a result, the contribution of 

these instruments to the annual growth rate of M3 

was relatively strong, standing at 2.7 percentage 

points in December 2007. 
This strong contribution conceals divergent developments before and after the start of the 
Þ nancial turmoil, which become visible when 
looking at developments in the sub-components. 
For instance, the annual growth rate of 
money market fund shares/units strengthened 
continuously in the year to July 2007. Some 
money market funds took on exposure to the 
structured credit market in order to boost returns 
and thereby outperform their benchmark money 
market rate. In the context of the Þ nancial turmoil, money market fund shares/units suffered 
particularly large net outß ows in August and 
September and again in December, leading 
to a decline in their annual growth rate. These 
outß ows are likely to have re
ß ected general 
risk aversion towards such funds, as investors 
seemingly felt unable to judge the risks taken by 
individual funds in terms of exposure to asset-
backed securities at a time when the price of such 
instruments was volatile and difÞ cult to assess. 
The disinvestment observed for money market 
fund shares/units was mirrored by strong inß ows for MFI short-term debt securities. Between 
August and November the money-holding 
sector™s holdings of such securities increased at 
the strongest rate since the start of Stage Three 
of EMU, thereby providing funding to the 
MFI sector.HOUSEHOLDS’ MONEY HOLDINGS GREW 

STRONGLY 
The broadest aggregation of M3 components 
for which reliable information is available 
by holding sector is short-term deposits plus 
repurchase agreements (hereafter referred to as 
ﬁM3 depositsﬂ). The annual growth rate of the 
aggregate M3 deposits of the household sector, 
the sector contributing the most to total M3 
deposit growth, reached 8.1% in December 2007 
(see Chart 8). The upward trend observed in this 
growth rate since mid-2004 thus continued, 
supported by income and wealth growth and 
the increasing remuneration of M3 deposits. 
The robust growth of household M3 deposits is 
therefore evidence of the strength of underlying 
money growth. Continuing the strengthening observed since 
late 2004, the annual growth rate of M3 deposits 

held by non-Þ nancial corporations increased 
further in the Þ rst half of 2007, before levelling 
off to stand at 11.1% in December 2007.
The strong corporate demand for liquid assets in 

2007 was in line with strong proÞ tability and robust 
(current and expected) business investment. The 

growth rate of M3 deposits held by other Þ nancial 
intermediaries (OFIs), which do not include
insurance corporations and pension funds, stood 

at 25.0% on an annual basis in December 2007. 

To some extent, this strengthening reß ects an 
increase in secured interbank lending settled 

through electronic trading platforms, as a loss

2007participants to prefer secured to unsecured 
interbank lending. In addition, this strengthening 

is also related in part to some investment funds™ 

need to maintain larger cash buffers and, in the 

fourth quarter of 2007, to additional deposit 

holdings in the context of the acquisition, through 

a non-monetary Þ nancial intermediary, of a euro 
area MFI by several other MFIs.CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR GREW 

VIGOROUSLYAfter strengthening in both 2004 and 2005,
the annual growth rate of MFI credit to euro
area residents stabilised in 2006. It remained 

robust in 2007, standing at 9.3% in the 

fourth quarter (see Chart 9). This strong
lending activity by MFIs reß ected the rapid 
expansion of credit to the private sector, while 

credit extended to general government was 

curtailed. 
More speciÞ cally, MFIs reduced somewhat their 
holdings of loans granted to general government, while they removed, on a net basis, fairly 
substantial amounts of general government debt 
securities from their portfolios. The annual rate of decline of holdings of general government 
securities stood at 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 
2007. This development has Œ with some brief 
exceptions Œ been observed since mid-2006 
and is typical of periods with rising short-term 
interest rates and funding costs.The annual growth rate of MFI credit to the 
private sector strengthened gradually over the 
period 2004-05, before stabilising at a high level 
in 2006. It remained robust in 2007, hovering 
at around 11.5%. Loans granted to the private 
sector remained the dominant form of credit 
granted by MFIs in 2007, while the importance 
of MFIs™ purchases of securities other than 
shares increased. The annual growth rate of MFI lending to the private sector stood at 11.1% in the fourth 
quarter of 2007, having hovered at this high level 
since mid-2006 with strong economic activity 
and favourable credit standards supporting loan 
growth. At the same time, rising bank interest 
rates, reß ecting the increases in key ECB interest rates since December 2005, have dampened 
private sector demand for credit. Chart 8 Sectoral M3 deposits(annual percentage changes; not adjusted for seasonal or calendar effects)2007200620052004200320023025

2007The strength of lending to the private sector masks divergent developments across the 
individual sectors. While the annual growth 
rate of loans to households moderated in 2007, 
continuing a trend observed since early 2006, 
the annual growth rates of lending to Þ nancial and non-Þ nancial corporations increased. 
The moderation in the annual growth rate of 
loans to households was driven mainly by 
the falling annual growth rate of lending for 
house purchase, which reß ected the slowdown 
observed in house price growth and housing 
market activity in a number of euro area 
economies and the gradual increase seen in 
mortgage rates throughout the euro area over 
the past few quarters. The annual growth rate of MFI loans to non-Þ nancial corporations increased in 2007, 
reaching a very high level by the standards of 
the past three decades. In the Þ rst half of the 
year demand for loans was supported by strong 
economic growth and merger and acquisition 
(M&A) activity, as well as favourable credit 
conditions. In the second half of 2007, against 
the background of the Þ nancial turmoil, the 
large quantities of MFI loans to the private non-
Þ nancial sector raised the question of whether 
the reported ß ow of loans to households and 
non-Þ nancial corporations had been distorted 
by banks™ balance sheet management in the 
face of the turmoil. The information available 
on the volume of loans removed from MFI 
balance sheets suggested that banks had been 
able to continue to remove loans from their 
balance sheets in the second half of 2007, albeit 
at a somewhat lower rate, suggesting that the 
ß ow of MFI loans to this sector continued to be understated by the data reported.Thus, the large quantities of loans in 2007 appeared to reß ect the 
ß ow of 
Þ nancing from banks to non-Þ nancial corporations 
and households, rather than re-intermediation 
triggered by the Þ nancial turmoil, which probably 
accounted for a small part of the expansion in 
MFI loans. Thus, the evidence did not support the view that the supply of bank credit had 
been severely affected by the turmoil in 2007. 
However, this evidence is consistent with the 
more restrictive supply conditions indicated 
by the two bank lending surveys for the third 
and fourth quarters, which point to signiÞ cant tightening of credit standards applied to the 
corporate sector, especially in the case of loans 
to larger Þ rms and loans with longer maturities. 
At the same time, non-Þ nancial corporations may 
have been able to continue borrowing through 
approved lines of credit under conditions agreed 
prior to the turmoil.The annual growth rate of loans to OFIs strengthened markedly in the course of 2007. In 
the Þ rst half of the year MFI lending to these 
entities seems to have been driven mainly 
by demand on the part of investment funds 
and demand for bridge Þ nancing for true-sale 
securitisation transactions. In the second half 
of the year demand for loans reß ected, for 
instance, the takeover of an MFI and investment 
funds™ portfolio management, as well as 
demand related to the turmoil resulting from the 
drawing-down of credit lines to conduits and 
structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and MFIs™ 
increased preference for secured interbank 
lending through electronic trading platforms.In 2007 MFIs provided credit to the private sector by increasing their holdings of securities 
issued by the corporate sector, especially 
through purchases of debt securities rather than 
through the acquisition of shares and other 
equity. The bulk of the securities purchased in 
2007 had long maturities. The strong growth of 
these securities holdings, particularly prior to the 
onset of the turmoil, reß ected loan securitisation 
activity in some euro area countries and the 
growing Þ nancial integration of the euro 
area, whereby MFIs in one euro area country 
purchase instruments securitising mortgage 
loans in other euro area countries as a substitute 
for direct investment in those mortgage markets. 
Additionally, in late 2007 MFIs purchased 
sizeable holdings of debt securities in the context 
of a takeover of an MFI executed by a Þ nancing 34ECBAnnual Report

2007vehicle belonging to the OFI sector. However, in the context of the Þ nancial turmoil, MFIs may 
have purchased instruments related to previously 
securitised loans, thus re-intermediating some of 
their loan portfolios. Among the other counterparts of M3, the 
annual growth rate of MFI longer-term Þ nancial 
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) held 

by the money-holding sector moderated to stand 

at 7.8% in December 2007, having stood at 

9.7% at the end of 2006. However, these Þ gures 
mask the fact that this growth rate strengthened 

until mid-2007 before gradually moderating 

thereafter, a pattern generally visible for both 

longer-term deposits and MFI debt securities. 

This is consistent with a shift in the preferences 

of the money-holding sector (namely an increased 

preference for shorter maturities) and may, to 

some extent, reß ect a moderation in the pace of 
securitisation activity, which is often associated 

with the creation of long-term deposits. 
The net external asset position of the MFI 

sector was marked by volatile developments 

in 2007. Sizeable capital inß ows in the 
Þ rst 
quarter of 2007 led to the annual inß ows in the 
net external asset position of the MFI sector 

reaching a record •340 billion in March as 

Þ nancial market participants saw favourable 
investment opportunities in the euro area 

in the context of low volatility and ample 

Þ nancial market liquidity. The net annual 
inß ow then moderated over the remainder of 
the year, reaching •17 billion in December, as 

investment positions ceased to be proÞ table and 
were therefore partly unwound. (For a detailed 

analysis of developments in the net external 

asset position of the MFI sector, see Box 1.) 

The monetary presentation of the balance of 

payments reveals that the annual inß ows in 
the net external asset position of MFIs mainly 

reß ect investment in euro area debt securities 
by non-resident investors. 
Box 1MFI NET EXTERNAL ASSETS AND THEIR IMPACT ON MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
The net external asset position of the MFI sector measures the net transactions, settled via resident 

MFIs, between the euro area money-holding sector and its counterparties outside the euro area. 

The net external asset position is one of the 

counterparts of the broad monetary aggregate 

M3 and at times plays an important role in 

accounting for monetary developments in 

the euro area. By contrast with most of 2006, 

pronounced movements were observed in 

2007 in the annual ß ow of the net external 
asset position, with a strong build-up at the 

end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007 and a 

subsequent unwinding in the second half of the 

year. While these movements were mirrored by 

the pattern of annual ß ows into M3 between 
October 2006 and April 2007, in the period 

between May and October 2007 this ceased to 

be the case (see Chart A). This box reviews the 

developments in MFI net external assets and 

investigates possible explanations.Chart A MFI net external assets and M3(annual ß ows in EUR billions)

2007Some conceptual issuesThe question of whether developments in the MFI net external asset position have an impact on M3 depends on the way in which euro area money-holding sectors, such as households or
non-Þ nancial corporations, Þ nance their transactions with the rest of the world.
1 For example, consider a situation in which a euro area household purchases a bond from a foreign entity resident 
in the United States. If this transaction is conducted using accounts held at an MFI, it implies a 
decline in the net external assets of the MFI sector, as the euro area credit institution in charge of 
the transaction either decreases its claims on its correspondent bank in the United States or grants 
a deposit to the US correspondent bank. However, the impact on M3 is ambiguous. On the one 
hand, if the purchase is Þ nanced using the overnight deposits that the household holds with its 
credit institution, there will be a dampening impact on M3 as the M1 component declines. On the 
other hand, if the transaction is Þ nanced by means of a loan granted to the household by the bank, 
there will be no impact on M3, but a change in the composition of the counterparts of M3.2Vice versa, if a foreign entity purchases a security from an entity in the euro area money-holding 
sector and settles this purchase by transferring money from its bank account at a euro area MFI 
to the bank account of the euro area entity, M3 will increase in connection with an increase in the 
net external assets of the euro area MFI sector. An important tool for investigating the factors underlying developments in the MFI net external asset position is the ﬁmonetary presentation of the balance of paymentsﬂ. This framework 
establishes a link between the balance of payments statistics and the MFI balance sheet statistics 
and makes it possible to determine whether the capital ß ows behind developments in the net 
external asset position originate from euro area money-holding sectors or from non-residents, 
and whether they reß ect the exchange of goods and services or direct and portfolio investment.
Explaining developments in MFI net external assets since late 2006The monetary presentation of the balance of payments suggests that the main source of the upward movement in the MFI net external asset position between late 2006 and spring 2007 
was portfolio investment in euro area assets Œ particularly in debt securities, but also in equities 
(see Chart B).3Debt securitiesLooking at the origin of the capital ß ows suggests that the rise in the annual ß ow of MFI net 
external assets resulted mostly from foreigners™ stronger investment in the euro area, rather 
than euro area residents™ repatriation of funds from abroad. Foreign investors™ portfolio 

investment in euro area debt securities was strong as of mid-2006, with annual ß ows 
reaching a new high in April 2007 and remaining elevated until the third quarter of 2007 
1 When analysing monetary developments, it should be borne in mind that only transactions between euro area money holders on th
e one hand and banks and non-euro area residents on the other have a direct impact on the money stock. A transaction between euro area 
non-MFIs simply represents the circulation of money within the money-holding sector, with no impact on the total money stock in the 

euro area. This is the case where private transactions are Þ nanced by an exchange of shares.
2 It should be emphasised that some transactions which affect MFI net external assets have no impact whatsoever on either money
 or credit. For example, a credit institution selling a euro area government bond to a non-resident will affect MFI net external assets 

(upwards) and credit to general government (downwards), without any impact on M3.3 For additional information regarding the monetary presentation of the euro area balance of payments, see the box entitled ﬁMo
netary presentation of the euro area balance of paymentsﬂ in the June 2003 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.36ECBAnnual Report
2007(see Chart C). This may reß ect a favourable investment environment in the euro area for 
foreign Þ nancial market participants, characterised by low volatility and ample liquidity in 
Þ nancial markets. Non-residents™ strong demand for euro area debt securities, in the context 
of reduced net issuance by euro area general government, was offset to a signiÞ cant extent 
by sales of government securities by MFIs.In the second half of the year, in the context of the Þ nancial turmoil and repricing of risk, certain 
investment positions may have ceased to be attractive. Non-euro area investors may also have needed liquidity for other operations and may therefore not have increased their investment in 
the euro area. At the same time, favourable investment opportunities in the rest of the world 
attracted investment by euro area residents. This was visible in the gradual increase in the annual 
ß ow of portfolio investment in foreign debt securities by euro area investors. Such investment 
may have become increasingly attractive in the context of a strengthening euro exchange rate. 
With foreign investment in debt securities in the euro area remaining broadly unchanged until 
August 2007 and declining strongly thereafter, and investment by euro area residents abroad 
remaining broadly stable, the annual ß ow in the MFI net external asset position moderated in the 
second half of the year.Equities and foreign direct investmentAs regards portfolio investment in equities, while investment by euro area non-MFIs abroad has been continuously declining, investment by foreigners in the euro area has remained fairly 
stable, albeit at a much more subdued level than investment in debt securities and despite 
declining slightly towards the end of the year. Qualitative information at the end of 2006 
and the beginning of 2007 indicated that global investors viewed euro area equity markets 
favourably and that investors™ expectations for euro area corporate proÞ ts were positive. Up to mid-2007 net portfolio investment in equity pointed to stronger annual inß ows in the net 
external asset position of MFIs, which were offset by the moderating impact of net direct 
investment. However, this pattern was reversed somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2007, when 
annual inß ows for net portfolio investment in equity decreased somewhat, but were offset by 
reduced net outß ows for direct investment.

2007In addition to the pronounced movements observed in MFI net external assets since late 
2006, there have been equally pronounced 
developments in the gross external assets 
(and liabilities) of the euro area MFI sector. 
This marks a change compared with the 
relatively gradual strengthening observed 
previously (see Chart D). The simultaneous 
expansion of these gross positions in 2007 
resulted mainly from a rapid strengthening in 
MFI credit granted to the rest of the world, 
which led to the incurrence of deposit liabilities 
by euro area MFIs vis-à-vis non-euro area 
residents.Such a simultaneous expansion of gross external 
assets and liabilities can be a reß ection of 
stronger Þ nancial integration. One consequence of this could be that intra-MFI sector transactions, 
such as MFIs in one euro area country funding the lending of MFIs in another euro area country, are 

increasingly channelled through a Þ nancial centre located outside the euro area. Another possibility 
is that resident credit institutions, for instance money market funds, operate solely on behalf of their 

non-euro area parent companies. If these institutions receive their funds only from the rest of the world 

and also invest them only in the parent company™s home market, their entire business will appear only 

in the external assets and liabilities of the consolidated balance sheet of the euro area MFI sector.The strong expansion of the gross external positions has no immediate implications for the net external position. However, this situation could possibly lead to large amounts of liquidity being 
shifted quickly, resulting in signiÞ cant short-term changes in the magnitude and direction of 
ß ows in the MFI net external asset position. This, in turn, increases the exposure of domestic monetary 
developments to external forces.ConclusionsThe net external asset position of the euro area MFI sector has seen strong movements since late 2006, with net annual inß ows in March 2007 that exceeded those observed in the period of portfolio shifts from 2001 to 2003. Developments in the net external asset position up to spring 
2007 had a visible impact on the pattern of M3 growth, at least from an accounting perspective. 
Transactions between the euro area money-holding sector and the rest of the world are likely to 
increase in scope with the worldwide integration of Þ nancial markets. Given the multiple driving 
forces and originators of such transactions, a detailed assessment of developments in net external 
assets in the context of the ECB™s monetary analysis will be an important challenge.Chart D Developments in gross external

2007MONEY MARKET TENSIONS EMERGED IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET TURMOIL 
Money market rates rose across the entire maturity 

spectrum in 2007. In the Þ rst half of the year this 
was in line with the increases in key ECB interest 

rates. Further signiÞ cant increases in unsecured 
money market rates were seen in the second half 

of the year, following the turbulence in money and 

Þ nancial markets. The spread between unsecured 
and secured money market rates widened at all 

maturities with the exception of the very short 

term. These spreads, despite having declined, 

remained at elevated levels in early 2008.The Governing Council raised the key ECB 
interest rates by 25 basis points in both March 

and June 2007, with the marginal lending 

rate, the minimum bid rate and the deposit 

rate reaching 5%, 4% and 3% respectively 

(see Chart 1). In the remainder of 2007 and 

early 2008 the key ECB interest rates remained 

unchanged. After rising steadily in the Þ rst 
half of the year in line with expectations of 

further increases in key ECB interest rates, 

unsecured money market rates rose strongly from 
9 August onwards owing to the tensions in 

money and Þ nancial markets following concerns 
about banks™ exposure to losses resulting 

from US sub-prime mortgages and complex 

derivative instruments (see Chart 10). These rates 

reached peak levels in mid-December, when 

the underlying tensions in the interbank market 

were exacerbated by uncertainties related to the 

year-end. On 29 February 2008 the one-month, 

three-month and twelve-month EURIBOR rates 

stood at 4.20%, 4.38% and 4.38% respectively, 

i.e. 57, 66 and 35 basis points higher than the 

levels observed on 2 January 2007. By contrast, 

secured interbank interest rates fell gradually from 

early August onwards, reß ecting the downward 
revision of markets™ expectations regarding the 

future path of key ECB interest rates. 
With the substantial increases seen in unsecured money market interest rates, the corresponding 
spread between unsecured and secured money 
market rates widened signiÞ cantly, particularly at 
maturities of one month and longer (see Chart 11). 
These spreads remained at elevated levels in the 
Þ nal months of the year, with the spread between

agreements) reaching a peak of 93 basis points 
on 17 December on account of the particular 
tensions observed towards the end of the year. 
While this spread subsequently declined, 
reaching 43 basis points on 29 February 2008, 
it remained elevated by comparison with its 
average level of around 7 basis points in the Þ rst half of 2007.The slope of the money market yield curve Œ as measured by the spread between the 
twelve-month and one-month EURIBOR rates 
Œ showed some volatility in the course of 2007, 
with that spread ß uctuating between -15 and 50 
basis points. On 29 February 2008 this spread 
stood at 18 basis points, compared with 40 
basis points on 2 January 2007 (see Chart 10). 
However, the slope of the money market yield 
curve should be interpreted with some caution, 
since by historical standards the spreads between 
unsecured EURIBOR rates and secured rates 
(such as EUREPO rates) were exceptionally 
pronounced during the second half of the year at maturities beyond the very short term as a 
result of the turbulence seen in money markets 
since August 2007.Interest rates implied by three-month EURIBOR futures for 2008 increased in the course of 2007. 
Nonetheless, this too must be interpreted 
with caution given the sharp increases seen in 
EURIBOR rates in the context of the money 
market tensions, which are likely to blur 
the usual information content of these rates 
with regard to interest rate expectations. On 
29 February 2008 the interest rates implied 
by three-month futures contracts maturing 
in March, June and September 2008 stood 
at 4.36%, 4.05% and 3.71% respectively, 
i.e. 33 and 6 basis points higher and 27 basis 
points lower than on 2 January 2007. During the Þ rst half of 2007 the implied 
volatility derived from options on three-month EURIBOR futures decreased. However, implied 
volatilities then increased signiÞ cantly from 
August onwards as the tensions in money and 
Þ nancial markets took hold (see Box 2).
Box 2 
THE VOLATILITY OF MONEY MARKET INTEREST RATES IN 2007
When assessing developments in the money market during 2007, it is important to analyse not 
only the level of interest rates (as described in the main text) but also their volatility. Two issues 
are particularly relevant in this regard: i) assessing the impact of monetary policy decisions on 
the money markets; and ii) analysing how well the market functions, in particular as regards the 
transmission of monetary policy signals from the short end to the long end of the interest rate 
maturity spectrum. As far as the Þ rst issue is concerned, central banks strive to ensure that their policy actions and 
communication do not themselves foster unnecessary uncertainty (e.g. by adding ﬁnoiseﬂ to the economy), which would typically manifest itself in higher volatility in Þ nancial markets. 
As regards the second issue, analysing volatility offers insights into the microstructure of money 
markets and the efÞ ciency with which they operate.
1 For instance, comparing the volatility of 1 One issue is thus the question of how to measure the volatility of interest rates and 
Þ nancial yields. This is discussed in the article 
entitled ﬁThe analysis of the euro money market from a monetary policy perspectiveﬂ in the February 2008 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin. 40ECBAnnual Report
2007interest rates at speciÞ c maturities with the average level of volatility across the whole maturity spectrum may allow the central bank to detect atypical movements in some segments of the money market, which, in turn, could be related to imperfections in the market™s structure and 
might impede the effective transmission of the monetary policy impulse.Against this background, an analysis of the volatility of money market interest rates over the course of 2007 may help to shed light on the impact of the Þ nancial turmoil observed as of 
August 2007. This box focuses on developments in the unsecured segment of the interbank 
market (i.e. transactions conducted without collateral), the segment most affected by the turmoil. 
It considers volatility measures derived from the overnight interest rate, interbank deposit rates at 
one, three, six and twelve-month maturities and the three-month EURIBOR (for which a variety 
of derivative contracts exist).2The evolution of money market interest rate volatility in 2007Chart A shows the evolution of historical realised volatility in the overnight interest rate in 2007. Between January and mid-July realised volatility was relatively low, standing at levels similar to 
those observed in recent years. Volatility exhibited the usual pattern of periodic rises conÞ ned to speciÞ c periods, namely the days between the last main re
Þ nancing operation and the last day of 
the reserve maintenance period.Following the increased volatility observed in most Þ nancial markets towards the end of July, 
growing tensions in the money market were observed in early August on account of the rising uncertainty related to banks™ potentially large losses on their investments in US sub-prime 
mortgage markets and related instruments. This resulted in higher demand for overnight liquidity 
and a sharp rise in the level of volatility. Volatility remained at very high levels until October, 2 The two measures of volatility reviewed in this box, namely realised historical volatility and implied volatility, are described in detail 
in the box entitled ﬁMeasuring volatility in the money marketﬂ in the article referred to in footnote 1.Chart A Daily realised volatility of the

2007when the situation stabilised somewhat, partly owing to the effectiveness of the liquidity policy conducted by the ECB in order to address the tensions in the money market. However, after
mid-November renewed tensions were observed. The overnight interest rate was again 
characterised by unusually high levels of volatility, particularly approaching the end of the year 
amid widespread market concerns regarding a potential liquidity shortage at the turn of the year. When considering longer-term rates Œ namely deposit interest rates with a maturity of one, three or twelve months Œ the proÞ le which emerges is broadly similar (see Chart B). However, some 
signiÞ cant differences emerge, with longer-term interest rates showing, in particular, a tendency   
to react more sharply to the August turmoil. What explained the increased volatility in August 2007 
Between the end of June and early August it became clear that a number of European Þ nancial institutions had incurred substantial losses on their activities in the US sub-prime mortgage markets. As concerns about exposure to US sub-prime mortgage defaults intensiÞ ed, the ability of conduits to reÞ nance themselves diminished and demand for liquidity on the part of banks needing to provide credit to these conduits increased. These phenomena were further exacerbated 
by difÞ culties in the valuation of these 
Þ nancial products. The increased demand for liquidity, 
together with a loss of trust among counterparties, resulted in a tendency to hoard liquidity on 
the part of a large proportion of banks, and overall market liquidity thus declined signiÞ cantly. Interest rates in the money market increased signiÞ cantly, not least in the overnight segment, 
where the interest rate reached, on an intraday basis, levels almost 70 basis points above the 
minimum bid rate. On 9 August, in view of the strong demand for liquidity in the overnight market, which was also causing a substantial increase in very short-term market interest rates, the Eurosystem injected 
a signiÞ cant amount of liquidity into the market for that day through an overnight re
Þ nancing operation. As money market tensions persisted, increases were observed in interest rates in the 
longer-term segments of the unsecured money market (i.e. on interbank loans not secured by 
an exchange of collateral), leading to spreads against the secured segments of up to Þ ve times 
the historical average. In order to facilitate a better distribution of liquidity among banks, the 
Eurosystem conducted various forms of liquidity-providing operation during the second half 
of the year. These measures, together with an active communication policy, helped the market 
to function more smoothly, at least in the short term, and helped to reassure banks that their 
liquidity needs would be fulÞ lled. As a result, the level of volatility in the secured market 
decreased somewhat for various maturities. Comparison of developments in realised and implied volatilitiesImplied volatility3 is calculated on the basis of options based on forward-looking expectations, thereby providing some indications of volatility over the horizon covered by the contracts(three months for the standard EURIBOR futures contracts). By contrast, realised volatility 
reß ects the perceived uncertainty prevailing in the market. 
3 The implied volatility used for this box is derived from options on three-month futures contracts with a constant six months 
to maturity. 42ECBAnnual Report
2007LARGE SWINGS IN GLOBAL BOND MARKETS IN 
2007Long-term government bond yields in the 
euro area stood at 4.4% at the end of 2007, 
which was around 40 basis points higher 
than the levels prevailing one year earlier 
(see Chart 12). However, this fairly small 
overall increase in yields masks relatively marked swings within the year. In particular, 
the Þ nancial turmoil emanating from problems 
in the US real estate sector led to heightened 
volatility in the global bond markets in the latter 
part of the year. Underlying the moderate overall 
change in long-term nominal bond yields in the 
euro area were slight increases in the real yields 
offered on ten-year inß ation-linked bonds and 
Although the proÞ les of the two volatility 
measures are broadly similar, developments 
in implied volatility are more pronounced than 
those in realised volatility calculated on the 
basis of the three-month deposit interest rate. 
Looking at Chart C, implied volatility started 
increasing in mid-July, before rising more 
strongly in early August, with pronounced 
ß uctuations being observed thereafter. A 
similar development was observed for realised 
volatility calculated on the basis of three-month 
deposit interest rates, although the rise in this 
measure was more gradual and, overall, more 
contained, including in August (i.e. in the most 
critical period for the euro money market). These developments observed in the two volatility 
measures mostly reß ect the nature of these measures. While the increase in the realised volatility of the 
three-month interest rate reß ects the perceived tensions in the three-month unsecured segment of the 
money market, implied volatility also takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the future impact 
of the tensions resulting from the announcements made by a number of European banks regarding 

their exposure to securitised products related to the sub-prime mortgage market. In particular, these 

ongoing tensions in the money market have led to increased uncertainty regarding the future Þ nancial 
and macroeconomic environment, which is captured by the measure of implied volatility, but not by 

the realised volatility measure.Following the exceptionally high levels observed until the beginning of September, the realised volatility measure declined somewhat during that month, possibly in response to the generous 
liquidity policy conducted as of mid-August. At the same time, implied volatility remained 
high, probably affected by the more pronounced tensions in the unsecured segment of the 
market, particularly at the three-month horizon, although it also showed a tendency to decline in 
September. Overall, notwithstanding the above-mentioned declines, both measures broadly stabilised thereafter, although at levels higher than those prevailing before the onset of the turmoil in 
August, indicating that a return to the stable market conditions that prevailed prior to the turmoil 
may take some time. Chart C Realised volatility and implied

bonds maturing in 2015 Œ a measure of long-term real interest rates Œ stood at 2% in late 
2007, around 20 basis points higher than at the 
end of 2006. The Þ ve-year forward break-even

Þ ve years ahead, which measures 
market participants™ long-term inß ation expectations and related risk premia, increased  

by 20 basis points in 2007, standing close to the 
2.4% mark at the end of the year.In the Þ rst half of 2007 long-term government 
bond yields rose markedly on both sides of the Atlantic. In the euro area, the yields on 
government bonds with a ten-year maturity 
increased by a maximum of around 70 basis 
points between the end of December 2006 and 
early July 2007, whereas ten-year bond yields 
in the United States peaked in mid-June at a 
level around 60 basis points higher than at the 
end of 2006. The upturn in euro area long-term 
interest rates reß ected markets™ expectations of 
strong economic growth. This assessment was 
consistent with what were, on average, better 
than expected data releases on macroeconomic 
and business sentiment. The gradual increase 
in euro area bond yields was brieß y interrupted 
on two occasions in the Þ rst six months of 2007. 
First, long-term bond yields fell in late February 
and early March, following a pronounced decline 
in risk appetite and resulting portfolio shifts 
from stock markets to bond markets. Second, in 
early June long-term bond yields rose markedly, 
reß ecting strong sell-offs originating in the US 
bond markets.All in all, the relatively strong recovery observed in nominal euro area bond yields in 
the Þ rst half of 2007 was driven mainly by an 
increase in the real interest rate component. 
At the same time, market participants™ long-
term inß ation expectations in the euro area 
and the related risk premia edged up only
marginally over this period. For instance, 
the Þ ve-year forward break-even in
ß ation rate Þ ve years ahead increased by 10 basis 
points in the Þ rst six months of 2007, 
standing at a level of 2.3% at end-June

to the state of the US real estate market began 

to mount. In particular, it became clear that

2007worthiness were experiencing problems in 
repaying ﬁsub-primeﬂ mortgages taken out during 

the period of very low interest rates between 

2002 and 2004. Investors initially felt that the 

problems would be restricted to the United States 

and that only a relatively limited set of assets 

would be affected. In late July that relatively 

benign scenario was seriously challenged when it 

became clear that European Þ nancial institutions, 
too, were heavily exposed to the US sub-prime 

mortgage market. In some limited cases, the 

losses from such exposures even endangered 

the Þ nancial health of the institutions concerned. 
The revelation of such serious risks led to 

broader-based Þ nancial market turmoil with 
a general increase in risk aversion, prompting 

ß ight-to-safety portfolio shifts from riskier assets 
into government bonds, for example.As a result of the turmoil, by the end of 
the year the yield on ten-year euro area 

government bonds had declined, overall, by 

30 basis points by comparison with early July, 

being driven mainly by lower real yields. 

The fall in US bond yields was far more 

pronounced, with the ten-year yield standing 

at the end of the year around 130 basis points 

lower than its peak in mid-June. The more 

marked decline in US yields appears to reß ect 
a weaker growth outlook for the US economy 

in the eyes of investors, as well as the decision 

of the FOMC to lower interest rates on 

18 September, 31 October and 11 December.All in all, the recent turbulence came at 
the end of a relatively long period of calm 

market conditions. It is likely that the 

relatively tranquil market conditions prior 

to the turmoil led many market participants 

to take investment decisions on the basis 

of risk assessments that turned out to be 

too optimistic. Box 3 highlights the main 

similarities and differences between the 

turmoil of 2007 and that of 1998.The Þ ve-year forward break-even in
ß ation rate 
Þ ve years ahead increased by another 10 basis 
points over the last six months of 2007, standing 
at 2.4% at the end of the year. The overall increase 
in break-even inß ation rates in 2007 might
have been related to the deterioration in the
short-term outlook for inß ation, which was linked, 
in particular, to surging oil and food prices. It 

is unclear, however, to what extent the overall 

increase in this indicator reß ects shifts in market 
participants™ long-term inß ation expectations and 
changes in the related risk premia.Market participants™ perception of bond market 
uncertainty in the euro area, as measured by 

implied volatility, remained stable throughout 

the Þ rst six months of the year. This 
reß ected expectations of a continued 
favourable environment in both the euro area 

and the global economy. This favourable 

assessment on the part of investors changed 

on account of the turmoil, with the result that 

implied bond market volatility surged between 

June and August. Thereafter implied volatility 

in the euro area remained broadly unchanged 

at those somewhat elevated levels.In the Þ rst two months of 2008 euro area 
long-term bond yields declined by around 30 basis points to stand at 4.1% on 29 February. 
Similar declines in real yields offered on 
inß ation-linked bonds suggest that market 
participants have, in early 2008, become slightly 
more pessimistic regarding the prospects for 
economic activity in the euro area. EURO AREA STOCK PRICES INCREASED AMID HIGH 

VOLATILITY IN 2007 
Despite strong volatility over the year, euro area 

stock prices increased overall in 2007, thereby 

continuing the upward trend observed since early 

2003 (see Chart 14). All in all, the Dow Jones 

EURO STOXX index ended the year with a 

gain of 5% vis-à-vis the end of 2006. The stock 

markets in the United States likewise ended 2007 

on a positive note, with the Standard & Poor™s 

500 index having risen by 3.5%, while Japanese 

stock prices, as measured by the Nikkei 225 

index, fell by around 11%. As with developments 

on the bond markets, ß uctuations in euro area 
stock prices were particularly pronounced in 

the summer months, when investors became 

reluctant to hold risky assets such as stocks. The 
45ECBAnnual Report
2007positive overall performance of the stock markets 
in the euro area was due mainly to the continued 

strength of actual and expected earnings growth.Euro area stock prices tended to rise steadily in 
the Þ rst six months of 2007. This upward trend 
was temporarily interrupted in late February and 

early March, when stock prices in the euro area, 

mirroring developments in most other major 

markets, experienced a sharp correction partly 

triggered by developments in the Chinese markets. 

The Dow Jones EURO STOXX index lost around 

4% of its value between 6 February and 7 March. 

After that, the markets recovered, partly fuelled 

by increased risk appetite, by M&A activities and 

by the persistently favourable developments in 

earnings. Evidence of the robust manner in which 

earnings developed can be seen in the fact that 

between January and June the earnings per share 

of companies included in the Dow Jones EURO 

STOXX index grew at an average annual rate of 

close to 17%. All in all, euro area stock prices  
stood in late June 10% higher than the levels 

recorded at the end of 2006.The optimism prevailing in global stock markets 
came to an abrupt halt with the outbreak of the 

Þ nancial turmoil, triggering a broad reassessment 
of credit and Þ nancial risks and  heightened risk 
aversion among investors. The resulting fall 

in euro area stock prices seems mainly to have 

reß ected a strong upsurge in the equity risk 
premium demanded for holding euro area stocks, 

in particular those of Þ rms in the Þ nancial sector. 
At the same time, implied stock market volatility 

picked up strongly and reached levels not observed 

since 2003 (see Chart 15). The sell-off in the euro 

area stock markets was particularly strong in July 

and August, when the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 

price index lost around 5% of its value.In September and early October euro area stock prices witnessed a recovery similar to that 
observed after the short-lived correction in late Chart 14 Major stock market indices 1)(index rebased to 100 on 2 January 2007; daily data)200720062005200420031201101009080

2007February and early March. Later on, however, 
between mid-October and the end of the year, 

investors™ risk aversion increased again after a 

number of Þ nancial institutions revealed that they 
had suffered larger than expected losses in US 

sub-prime investments. As a result, euro area and 

global stock prices plummeted and stock market 

uncertainty, as reß ected in implied volatility, 
rebounded again to reach levels close to those 

observed in the summer months.The Þ nancial market turmoil had remarkably little 
impact on the expected and actual proÞ tability 
of euro area Þ rms. Between December 2006 and 
December 2007 the earnings per share of Þ rms 
included in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX index 
grew by 15%. At the same time, analysts expected 

earnings to grow at an annual rate of around 9% in 

2008. The fact that euro area Þ rms™ pro
Þ tability was 
largely unaffected by the Þ nancial market turmoil 
probably helped to dampen the overall decline 

observed in the second half of 2007.Looking at developments in individual sectors, 
the telecommunications and utility sectors 
strongly outperformed the overall index. 
The strong performance of these sectors was 
probably due to investors™ preference for Þ rms with relatively steady cash ß ows. At the same 
time, the Þ nancial sector underperformed 
by comparison with the overall index. The 
poor performance of this sector was related to 
increasing concerns about its proÞ tability in 
the context of its generally strong exposure to 
assets linked either directly or indirectly to the 
ailing sub-prime mortgage market in the United 
States.In early 2008 continued credit risk concerns coupled 
with lower earnings expectations contributed to 

lower stock prices. The Dow Jones EURO STOXX 

index and the Standard & Poor™s 500 index both 

fell, by 14% and 9% respectively, between the end 

of 2007 and 29 February 2008.Box 3 
SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EPISODES OF FINANCIAL TURBULENCE IN 2007 AND 1998
In the second half of 2007 global Þ nancial market prices were seriously affected by a general 
repricing of Þ nancial risk, which spread from one speci
Þ c credit market segment (assets backed 
by US sub-prime mortgages) to the credit markets as a whole and the Þ nancial system more 
generally. The sequence and nature of the events characterising the recent turmoil resemble to 
some extent those of the Þ nancial market turbulence experienced in the second half of 1998, 
typically referred to as the ﬁLTCM crisisﬂ. Looking at Þ nancial market indicators, this box 
highlights the main similarities and differences between the two episodes.In the Þ rst half of 1998 most advanced economies experienced favourable market conditions in the 
form of surging stock prices, stable long-term bond yield developments and a narrowing of corporate 
bond spreads, partly fuelled by strong macroeconomic conditions (see Charts A and B on US and 

euro area bond yields and stock prices). The generally tranquil global Þ nancial market environment 
began to change in the summer of 1998. The shifts observed in Þ nancial market sentiment and 
investors™ risk appetite appeared to be closely related to two main factors: Þ rst, market participants 
became more pessimistic about the impact that the 1997 contraction in Asian emerging markets 

would have on the global economy; and second, market concerns regarding the sustainability of 

Russian debt began to mount. These worries culminated on 17 August, when Russia announced debt 

restructuring, devaluation and a moratorium on private principal repayments. These announcements 

sparked a sell-off in global equity markets and corporate bond markets. Flight-to-safety portfolio 

shifts led to lower yields on long-term government bonds (see Chart A). 
47ECBAnnual Report
2007The strong market reaction to the Russian default led to mounting concerns about a global credit 
crunch. Many hedge funds and banks™ proprietary desks reported big losses, mainly as a result of 

the widening of corporate bond spreads and other risk spreads. The widening of spreads resulted 

in margin calls and a corresponding need for additional liquidity in order to fund positions. In early 

September 1998 short-term funding problems became particularly severe for one of the largest hedge 

funds Œ Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). There were widespread concerns that LTCM 

would be forced to unwind big positions in already tight market conditions, which could in turn give 

rise to severe systemic risks for the global Þ nancial system. However, several actions over the next 
few weeks helped the market to begin functioning normally again: Þ rst, on 23 September a private 
rescue plan was announced for LTCM; and second, the Federal Reserve decided to lower policy rates 

by a total of 100 basis points in three steps. Overall, the crisis had little impact on the real economy.Two notable similarities can be discerned between the episodes of turbulence in 2007 and 1998, the Þ rst relating to the 
Þ nancial market environment prior to the turbulence and the second to the 
fact that in each case the factor triggering the turmoil was only a relatively small shock. As regards the Þ rst similarity, in both cases the environment prior to the turbulence was 
characterised by prolonged periods of general upward movements in asset prices across 
most segments, coupled with low levels of Þ nancial market volatility. These very favourable 
market conditions may have led some investors to take investment decisions on the basis of 

risk assessments which turned out to be too optimistic. As a result, those investors probably 

placed too much weight on recent experience, extrapolating recent trends that were at odds with
long-run equilibrium values and probabilities. 
Second, in both cases the Þ nancial turbulence erupted in the absence of major in
ß ationary 
or economic shocks, the two crises being triggered, instead, by relatively small shocksChart A US and euro area long-term bond

2007GRADUAL MODERATION IN THE DYNAMICS OF 
HOUSEHOLD BORROWINGThe dynamics of household borrowing slowed in 

the course of 2007, reß ecting the dampening impact 
of higher lending rates, lenders™ more cautious 

assessment of credit risks and a moderation in 
housing market dynamics. MFIs were the main 

source of household borrowing, with the annual 

growth rate of MFI loans to households remaining 

robust at 6.2% in December 2007, having stood at 

7.2% in mid-2007 and 8.2% at the end of 2006. 

The gradual and continuous nature of this slowdown 
(i.e. unexpected defaults in sizeable, although not extremely large, market segments) which gave rise 

to general repricing of Þ nancial risk, leading to extreme price movements in speci
Þ c market segments 
(particularly the credit market segment). It cannot be ruled out that the strong market reactions may 

have been ampliÞ ed by the above-mentioned tranquil market environment, in which valuations for some 
asset classes seem, at least ex post, to have been somewhat elevated from a fundamental point of view. 
Despite the similarities reported above, developments during the two crises differ in a number of respects. 
First, the Þ nancial innovations of the past decade in the 
Þ eld of credit risk transfer have substantially 
increased the difÞ culty of determining the sectors and speci
Þ c entities in which such risks ultimately 
reside. Although the increased use of securitisation, where illiquid loans are converted into liquid 

instruments, has enhanced investors™ diversiÞ cation opportunities, the pricing of these new products is, 
in many cases, extremely complex. The surge in the use of these instruments and uncertainties regarding 

counterparties™ exposures may partly explain recent developments in a number of market segments. 

Second, the recent turmoil has predominantly affected spreads and liquidity in the credit and money 

markets. In 1998, by contrast, liquidity dried up in the government bond markets, too, as many risky 

investment strategies pursued during this period also involved positions in government debt securities. 
Third, the two charts show that there was some decoupling of asset price reactions in the euro area 
and the United States during the two Þ nancial crises. In 1998 stock prices dropped more sharply in the 
euro area than in the United States. This difference in stock price performance was probably related 

to an increase in economic growth differentials between the two economies. This could be seen in the 

fact that output growth was stable in the United States throughout 1998, while in the euro area real 

GDP growth fell from an annual rate of 3.8% in the Þ rst quarter of 1998 to 2.4% in the fourth quarter. 
By contrast, long-term bond yields declined by similar amounts in the two economies. In 2007, too, 

expected growth differentials may have contributed to the somewhat different patterns seen in euro area 

and US asset prices. For instance, the interest rate differential between US and euro area long-term bond 

yields narrowed in the months following the outbreak of the turmoil, even turning negative for the Þ rst 
time since early 2004. It seems that in the latter part of 2007 market participants viewed the euro area 

economy as being somewhat more resilient to the recent turmoil than the US economy. Corresponding 

expectations of stronger monetary policy reactions in the United States on the back of such changes 

in investors™ relative growth forecasts for the two economies contributed to this change of sign in the 

US-euro area long-term interest rate differential. At the same time, US and euro area stock prices have 

moved more or less in tandem during the recent turbulence, suggesting a strong international factor 

driving stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Fourth, emerging markets have weathered the 2007 market turmoil much better than in 1998. The 
moderate impact in 2007 suggests that emerging markets have, over the past decade, become more 

resilient to shocks in the global Þ nancial system. While emerging markets™ indebtedness played a central 
role in the 1998 turmoil, emerging markets have hardly been involved in the recent turmoil, cushioning 

instead the resulting risks for the global economy.49ECBAnnual Report
2007in lending to households suggests that it is being 
driven mainly by fundamental factors and that the 

Þ nancial turmoil has, so far, had a limited impact 
on lending to households. At the same time, the 

annual growth rate of loans to households by non-
MFIs (i.e. OFIs and insurance corporations and 

pension funds) continued to exceed that of MFI 

loans to households in 2007. 
The breakdown of MFI loans to households by 
purpose indicates that the main driver of borrowing 

remained house purchases. The annual growth
rate of loans for house purchase was 7.1% 

in December 2007, having stood at 9.6% in 

December 2006 (see Chart 16). This moderation 

wasconsistent with the slowdown observed in 

house price growth and housing market 

activity in a number of euro area economies. 

The results of the Eurosystem™s bank lending 

survey support this assessment, as in the course 

of 2007 banks identiÞ ed housing market 
prospects and, increasingly, developments in 

consumer conÞ dence as factors contributing to the 
dampening of households™ demand for housing 
loans. The moderation in loan growth observed 

towards the end of 2007 may also have reß ected 
the dampening impact of tighter credit standards as 

banks became more worried about housing market 

prospects and the general economic outlook. 
The moderation in the annual growth rate of loans 
for house purchase also reß ected the dampening 
impact of the increases in key ECB interest rates 

since December 2005. Continuing the trend 

observed in 2006, MFI lending rates for house 

purchase rose by 66 basis points between December 

2006 and the end of December 2007 (see Chart 17). 

Rates increased more strongly for loans for house 

purchase with a ß oating rate and an initial rate 
Þ xation period of up to one year or over ten years 
than for loans with intermediate maturities.Similarly, although at a lower level, the annual 
growth rate of consumer credit declined to 5.3% 

in December 2007, down from 7.7% at the end 

of 2006. The annual growth rate of consumer 

credit has declined in line with falling consumer 

conÞ dence and the gradual moderation seen in the

2007growth of retail sales in the euro area. The results 
of the bank lending survey indicate that over 

the Þ rst three quarters of 2007 credit standards 
were eased on a net basis, thereby supporting 

the growth of loans, while in the fourth quarter, 

in the context of the Þ nancial turmoil, credit 
standards were tightened. In this regard, it 

should also be noted that banks reported growing 

concerns in the course of the year regarding 

consumer creditworthiness and the outlook for 

general economic activity, which may have 

reduced lending activity. At the same time, MFI 

interest rates on consumer credit, which remained 

well above those on loans for house purchase, 

increased by 55 basis points between December 

2006 and December 2007, thus contributing to 

the dampening of demand for such loans. 
HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS INCREASED FURTHERNotwithstanding the moderation observed in 

the growth rate of lending to households, the 

robust pace of borrowing led to a further increase 

in the ratio of household debt to disposable 

income, which reached 92.5% in the third quarter 

(see Chart 18), while the debt-to-GDP ratio rose 

to 60.3% in that quarter on the basis of data from 

the euro area integrated accounts. However, when 

compared with the United States or the United 

Kingdom, the level of indebtedness of euro area 

households is still relatively modest. The continued 

rise in households™ indebtedness has increased 

their exposure to changes in interest rates, income 
and asset prices. It should be noted that this 

ratio represents an average level and the level of 

indebtedness may vary markedly across different 

households in the various countries of the euro area. 

Higher levels of exposure apply, for instance, where 

households took advantage of the exceptionally 

favourable interest rate conditions prevailing in 

previous years and took out mortgages at variable 

rates with low initial interest payments. This rising 

indebtedness, combined with higher lending rates 

for households, contributed to an increase in the 

debt servicing burden in 2007, measured as interest 

payments plus principal repayments as a percentage 

of disposable income. The interest payment burden 

increased further to stand at 3.2% in the third quarter 

of 2007, up from 2.8% at the end of 2006 and well 

above the levels observed in 2004 and 2005, but 

also below the previous peak observed in 2001. 
THE COST OF THE EXTERNAL FINANCING OF NON-
FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS INCREASED IN 2007In 2007 the real cost of the external Þ nancing 
of non-Þ nancial corporations in the euro area 
increased progressively, thereby continuing 

the trend observed in 2006, while corporate 

proÞ tability remained strong. Despite this, and 
reß ecting an increase in the funding gap, the 
growth rate of the external Þ nancing of non-
Þ nancial corporations remained very high, fuelled 
by strong demand for MFI loans. As a result, the 

leverage of the non-Þ nancial corporate sector is 
expected to have increased further in 2007.Following the increases in key ECB interest rates in 2006 and the Þ rst half of 2007, the real 
overall cost of the external Þ nancing of euro 
area non-Þ nancial corporations continued to rise 
in 2007 (see Chart 19).2 Throughout the year the increase was driven mainly by continued

2007in the cost of external corporate Þ nancing as 
lenders and other investors re-evaluated their perceptions of credit risk, with the result that 
market Þ nancing conditions became tighter than 
in the past.Turning to the components of the cost of external corporate Þ nancing, interest rates 
on MFI loans to non-Þ nancial corporations 
increased signiÞ cantly in both real and nominal 
terms in the course of 2007 (see Chart 19). 
The rise in short-term money market interest 
rates Œ which totalled 120 basis points between 
the end of 2006 and the end of 2007 in the case 
of the three-month EURIBOR Œ was followed 
by smaller increases in short-term MFI lending 
rates to corporate borrowers. In particular, 
the rates on loans with ß oating rates and an 
initial rate Þ xation period of up to one year 
increased by around 90 to 100 basis points in 
the case of small and large loans over the same 
period. These increases probably also reß ected the effects that previous increases in money 
market rates in 2006 had on MFI short-term 
lending rates, thereby broadly following the pattern of a lagged pass-through observed in 
previous cycles. Long-term MFI lending rates 
also increased in the same period Œ by between 
60 and 85 basis points. In the same period 
Þ ve-year government bond yields increased by 
30 basis points. As a result, the spreads between 
long-term bank lending rates and comparable 
market rates widened signiÞ cantly, especially in 
the second half of the year. The widening of the 
spreads reß ected the increase in banks™ funding 
costs.The real cost of non-Þ nancial corporations™ 
Þ nancing through market-based debt also 
increased signiÞ cantly in 2007, continuing the 
trend started in 2006. By December 2007 this cost was around 190 basis points above the low 
recorded in the summer of 2005. From June 
2007 onwards increases in the yields on 
corporate bonds were larger than those observed 
for corresponding government bonds, with the 
result that spreads widened accordingly in the 
second half of the year. This increase in spreads 
is likely to have reß ected perceptions of higher 
credit and liquidity risk among investors across 
the globe, as well as an increase in Þ nancial market volatility after a prolonged period of 
highly compressed spreads.3The real cost of non-Þ nancial corporations™ 
Þ nancing through quoted equity also rose 
progressively in the course of 2007, despite 
the increases in stock market prices (measured, 
for instance, by the broad euro area index) in 
the Þ rst half of the year. In the second half of 
2007 declines in stock market prices contributed 
to the increase in the cost of issuing equity. 
However, the calculation of the cost of equity 
relies on certain assumptions concerning Þ rms™ expected future cash ß ows and the results should 
therefore be interpreted with some caution.FURTHER RISE IN NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS’

20072007, continuing the upward trend observed as of late 2004. In the fourth quarter the real 
annual growth rate of the external Þ nancing of 
non-Þ nancial corporations stood at 5%, up from 
an average of 4% in 2006. This development was 
driven mainly by an increase in the contribution 
of loans granted by MFIs, with a more limited 
rise in the contribution of debt securities and 
quoted shares (see Chart 21).Demand for external Þ nancing remained very 
strong in spite of the robust generation of internal funds. In particular, proÞ ts remained at 
sound levels throughout 2007 according to 
evidence from aggregated Þ rm-level data taken 
from the Þ nancial statements of listed 
Þ rms (see Chart 20).4 However, it must also be borne in mind that, while earnings expectations in the 
euro area remained high throughout the year, 
the last quarter of 2007 saw a signiÞ cant increase 
in the number of downward revisions to the 
earnings expectations of listed euro area Þ rms.The rate of growth of MFI loans to non-Þ nancial corporations generally increased further in 2007, continuing the trend observed since the 
beginning of 2004. This rate of growth stood 
at 14.5% in December 2007 and rose further to 
stand at 14.6% in January 2008. Indeed, such 
strong loan growth dynamics have not been 
seen since the introduction of the euro in 1999. 
Consequently, on the basis of hard data, there 
were no signs of a weakening in the growth 
of lending to non-Þ nancial corporations in 
the wake of the recent turbulence in the credit 
markets. Part of the continued strength of MFI 
loan growth in the euro area may be explained 
by the following two factors. First, according to 
banks™ assessment of the situation, as revealed 
in the latest bank lending surveys, Þ nancing needs related to real economic activity Œ 
particularly for inventories, working capital and 
Þ xed capital investment Œ continue to explain 
the persistent increase in loan demand. Second,

2007have been supported by some shifts away from market-based debt Þ nancing in the light of the 
more difÞ cult conditions seen in the corporate 
debt markets in the latter part of 2007. By 
contrast, other factors of a more Þ nancial nature, 
such as reduced Þ nancing needs for M&As or 
the increases seen in lending rates, probably 
contributed to the dampening of loan demand. 
In this respect, the less favourable Þ nancing conditions experienced by the banks themselves 
may also have contributed to the lower loan 
demand, with banks passing on their more 
stringent Þ nancing conditions when granting 
credit to corporate borrowers.Market-based Þ nancing Œ through both debt 
and equity Œ also increased in line with the 
growth of bank-based corporate Þ nancing, 
although to a far lesser extent. The annual 

growth rate of debt securities issued by non-
Þ nancial corporations rose from around 4.5% 
at the beginning of the year to 10.1% in 

July 2007, which was a signiÞ cant increase, 
particularly when compared with the 

relatively modest growth of previous years. 

More recently the annual growth rate of debt 

securities issued by non-Þ nancial corporations 
has declined somewhat. Looking at short-term 

developments in seasonally adjusted data, the 

decline in the net issuance activity of non-
Þ nancial corporations became far more marked 
as of August 2007. This may have been related 

to the rise in corporate bond spreads following 

problems in the credit markets, as well as to 

reduced M&A activity. The annual growth 

rate of quoted shares issued by non-Þ nancial 
corporations tended to increase somewhat in 

2007, but it remained subdued. The overall 

modest contribution made by the net issuance 

of quoted shares to the net Þ nancing of the 
euro area corporate sector was probably related 

both to the fact that the real cost of equity 

is signiÞ cantly higher than the real cost of 
debt Þ nancing and to the ample availability 
of internal funds. At the same time, gross 

issuance rose somewhat in 2007, supported 

by developments in both initial and secondary
public offerings.The overall increase in the external Þ nancing of 
non-Þ nancial corporations can be linked to the 
increase in the Þ nancing gap or net borrowing Œ 
calculated as the difference between corporate 
savings and non-Þ nancial investment 
(see Chart 22). The wider Þ nancing gap 
experienced by non-Þ nancial corporations in 
the euro area in 2006 and the Þ rst three quarters 
of 2007 resulted from the increase in real 
investment and the decline in corporate savings. 
In an environment of strong operating proÞ ts, declines in corporate savings mainly reß ected  
increases in interest rate payments, but also the 
fact that corporations distributed a larger share 
of their proÞ ts during that period.
RISING CORPORATE DEBTAs regards developments in the balance sheet 
position of non-Þ nancial corporations in the 
euro area, the strong rise in debt Þ nancing led 
to further increases in debt ratios, continuing 
the trend observed since the beginning of 2005 
(see Chart 23). In this respect, the estimated 
ratios of debt to GDP and debt to gross operating 
surpluses rose to around 78% and 386% 
respectively in the last quarter of 2007. After a 
period of consolidation between 2002 and 2004, 
which had followed a sharp increase in debt 
in the second half of the 1990s, the debt ratiosChart 22 Non-financial corporations’

ratio of non-Þ nancial corporations™ debt to 
Þ nancial assets remained stable in the 
Þ rst three quarters of 2007, after having been on a 
declining trend since the Þ rst quarter of 2003. 
The recent increases in debt, coupled with interest rate increases, caused the net interest 
burden of non-Þ nancial corporations to rise 
signiÞ cantly in the course of 2007.
2.3 PRICE AND COST DEVELOPMENTS
Overall HICP inß ation was 2.1% on average 
in 2007, 0.1 percentage point lower than in the 
preceding two years (see Table 1). However, 
the 2007 average is the result of two distinct 
patterns in HICP developments over the course 
of the year: annual inß ation rates remained 
below 2% and broadly stable until the end 
of the summer, and grew rapidly thereafter. 
In September 2007 consumer price inß ation rose slightly above 2% for the Þ rst time since 
August 2006. It then increased to elevated 
levels, reaching a peak of 3.1% in November 
and December 2007. HICP inß ation developments in 2007 were 
largely determined by strong energy and food price increases (see Chart 24). The effects 
of the rise in oil prices in early 2007 on the 
energy price component of the HICP were 
reduced by favourable base effects until 
July 2007; thereafter, a combination of surging 
oil prices and adverse base effects led to a 
substantial contribution from this component 
to overall HICP inß ation. Annual rates of

BY ENERGY AND FOOD PRICE DEVELOPMENTSLooking in more detail at HICP developments in 

2007, oil price increases and base effects stemming 

from previous energy price developments, 

together with food price increases, signiÞ cantly 
affected the proÞ le of HICP in
ß ation.In mid-January 2007 the strong downward trend in 

oil prices on international markets that had started 

in August 2006 came to a halt, and prices began 

rising again. In December 2007 oil prices in euro 

were about 32% higher than a year earlier.5 The annual average price in euro of a barrel of Brent crude oil 5 remained practically unchanged in 2007, whereas oil prices in 2006 were on average 19% higher than those in 2005.Chart 24 Breakdown of HICP inflation: main

2007In a number of months in the period from January 
to July 2007 the effects of the rise in oil prices on 

the energy price component of the HICP were 

reduced by favourable base effects from the strong 

increase in energy prices observed a year earlier. 

From September 2007 onwards, a combination of 

surging oil prices and adverse base effects led to a 

substantial contribution from the energy component 

to overall HICP inß ation (see Chart 25). In the 
fourth quarter of the year, the annual rate of change 

in HICP energy prices was 8.1%, compared with 

0.8% on average in the Þ rst three quarters of the 
year. While base effects inß uenced the monthly 
developments of annual HICP inß ation, favourable 
and unfavourable base effects broadly offset each 

other for the year as a whole, implying that the 
contribution of the energy component to overall 

inß ation in 2007 re
ß ected the increases in oil prices 
that occurred over the year (see Box 4).The contribution of the other typically volatile component of inß ation, unprocessed food 
prices, to the overall inß ation rate also increased 
in 2007, following an acceleration in this 
component in 2006. The annual rate of change in 
unprocessed food prices remained elevated for 
most of 2007, although monthly developments 
were characterised by considerable volatility, 
mainly on account of changes in fruit and 
vegetable prices, which were affected by bad 
weather conditions in Europe, especially in 
the spring of 2007. Meat prices, which had Box 4THE IMPACT OF ENERGY BASE EFFECTS ON HICP INFLATION IN 2007
The annual rate of HICP inß ation increased 
substantially in the course of 2007. In 

December it stood at an elevated 3.1% Œ a 

level unseen since May 2001 Œ up from 1.9% 

in November 2006. This increase was almost 

entirely the result of three consecutive sharp
rises in annual inß ation in September, October 
and November, and was driven mostly by 

signiÞ cant contributions from price developments 
in the energy and processed food components
(see Chart A).It is important to establish to what extent changes 
in the year-on-year inß ation rate re
ß ect current 
developments (i.e. actual ﬁnewsﬂ from one 

month to the next) and to what extent they reß ect 
the impact of price volatility in the previous year, 

through ﬁbase effectsﬂ 1. This box reviews the role 
of base effects, in particular from energy price 

developments, in driving recent HICP inß ation 
developments and provides some insight into 

their prospective impact over 2008.1 A base effect can be de
Þ ned as the contribution to the change in the year-on-year in
ß ation rate in a particular month that stems from 
a deviation of the month-on-month rate of change in the base month (i.e. the same month one year earlier) from its usual or ﬁnormalﬂ pattern, taking account of seasonal ß uctuations. Chart A Contributions to the change in

2007The derivation of a monthly seasonal pattern for each HICP component makes it possible to separate the contributions of base effects and current developments to monthly changes in the 
annual rate of HICP inß ation (see Chart B).
2Base effects had a substantial impact on the pattern of headline inß ation rates in 2007, as had 
been anticipated. 3 Over the course of the year, the most signiÞ cant monthly contributions came 
from base effects in the energy price component, owing to the volatile pattern of month-on-month 

oil price developments in 2006. From January to July 2007 favourable energy base effects had 

a downward impact on the headline inß ation rate. In the second half of 2007, by contrast, the 
year-on-year rate of increase in the HICP was affected by unfavourable energy base effects, which 

were especially strong in September and October. Base effects from non-energy components were, 

overall, relatively small in 2007.Nevertheless, inß ation developments in the last quarter of the year were essentially driven by 
month-on-month price dynamics, owing to the surge in energy prices and also processed food prices. In November, in particular, most of the contribution from the energy component to the 
increase in HICP inß ation was due to the pass-through of the recent increases in oil prices in 
international markets. In addition to the impact from crude oil prices, there was some increase in 
the reÞ ning margin, reß ecting higher proÞ ts for energy suppliers. In December, by contrast, the energy component exerted some downward pressure on the overall headline inß ation rate, but 
this was broadly offset by further upward pressure from processed food prices. The fall in the 2 The contribution of base effects to the monthly changes in the year-on-year rate of in

2007increased at a sustained pace in 2006, continued to record heightened annual rates of growth in 
2007. In part, this development reß ected the 
price increases in global markets of animal feed 
and other input costs.A major contribution to the rise in HICP inß ation 
in late 2007 came from processed food prices, 
which started to rise at stronger rates towards 

the end of the summer. In the last quarter of the 

year the annual growth rate of the processed food 

component stood at 4.5%, the highest rate ever 

recorded since the start of Monetary Union in 

1999. The increase in the annual rate of change of 

processed food prices occurred in the context of 

strong increases in the prices of some agricultural 

commodities in world markets, which were driven 

by a combination of temporary and structural 
factors (see Box 5). The ﬁbread and cerealsﬂ and 

ﬁmilk, cheese and eggsﬂ sub-components were 

the most affected. 
Non-energy industrial goods prices rose by 
1.0% in 2007, a higher rate than in previous 

years. This acceleration mainly reß ected the 
effects of the VAT increase in Germany, the 

input cost pressures signalled by domestic 

producer prices for consumer goods, and 

the fact that capacity utilisation in the 

manufacturing sector stood around historically 

high levels throughout the whole year. These 

effects more than offset the dampening 

inß uence of lower import price pressures, 
which reß ected exchange rate developments, 
in an environment of strong international 

competition. Finally, services price inß ation 
energy component was mainly due to the impact of a decrease in crude oil prices over the month, 
while the base effect from energy price developments a year earlier was almost negligible.Looking at the year as a whole, total base effects from energy and non-energy components had a relatively minor cumulated impact on the annual rate of increase in HICP inß ation, as favourable 
and unfavourable inß uences almost exactly offset one another (see Chart C).
Overall, of the total 1.1 percentage point increase in the HICP annual growth rate between 
December 2006 and December 2007, only 0.1 percentage point reß ected the cumulative upward 
impact of energy base effects, while the remaining 1 percentage point reß ected price dynamics in 
2007. It therefore appears that most of the total increase in annual HICP inß ation was accounted 
for by current inß ation developments.
Looking ahead, the HICP inß ation rate is expected to moderate over the course of 2008, 
assuming some reversal of the recent rises in energy and food commodity prices in international 

markets, as currently embedded in futures prices. In 2008 total base effects from both energy 

and non-energy prices are expected to make substantial downward contributions to inß ation 
developments (of around 1.1 percentage point cumulatively in the 12 months to December 

2008).4 The impact will generally be concentrated towards the end of the year as the signiÞ cant 
increases in energy and food prices recorded in the second half of 2007 will drop out of the 

annual comparison 12 months later. However, the extent to which these negative base effects 

will also lead to lower HICP inß ation hinges crucially on the absence of further shocks to 
oil and food prices and on the moderate evolution of the other HICP components, which in 

particular requires the absence of second-round effects.4 See the box entitled ﬁAccounting for recent and prospective movements in HICP in
ß ation: the role of base effectsﬂ in the January 2008 
issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.59ECBAnnual Report
2007increased markedly at the beginning of 2007, 
mostly inß uenced by the VAT increase in 
Germany, and remained at elevated levels 

throughout the year.While the annual average growth rate of 
the overall HICP was broadly stable in 

2007, the annual growth rate of the HICP 

excluding the volatile unprocessed food and 

energy components increased to 2.0% in 

2007 from 1.5% in the previous two years. 
This indicator was affected by the German 

VAT increase at the beginning of the year. 

It remained stable at 1.9% from February 

to July 2007 and then started to move 

upwards again in August, mainly because 

of strong increases in processed food prices. 

By the end of the year, HICP inß ation 
excluding unprocessed food and energy 

had reached 2.3%, the highest level since 

end-2002.Box 5FOOD PRICE INFLATION IN THE EURO AREA
Food price inß ation increased sharply in the euro area in the second half of 2007, at both the 
producer and consumer level. Producer prices of food products and beverages rose by 4.5% 
on average in 2007, the highest rate for more than six years. HICP food prices rose by 4.3% in 
December 2007, up from 2.4% on average in 2006. The increase in HICP food prices was mainly 
driven by the processed food component. Within this component, the prices of cereals and bread 
and those of milk, cheese and eggs rose particularly sharply (see Chart A). Food prices played an 
important role in the rise in overall HICP inß ation in the second half of 2007. This box considers 
the potential factors driving movements in food price inß ation in the euro area and discusses 
the outlook. The rise in food price inß ation in the euro area largely re
ß ects global factors. The prices of several 
agricultural commodities, such as cereals and oilseeds, increased sharply in global markets 
in 2007 (see Chart B). In part, these price increases reß ected temporary 
factors, such as adverse weather conditions in 
some major agricultural commodity-exporting 

countries which affected the global supply of 

these commodities. High energy prices also 

increased the cost of energy-intensive inputs for 

agriculture, such as fertiliser, fuel for transport 

and machinery. In addition, international food 

prices were pushed up by the strong rise in the 

global demand for foodstuffs resulting from 

the changes in food consumption patterns in 

many developing economies, as well as from 

the emergence of new sources of demand for 

some agricultural commodities, particularly 

for the production of biofuels. As these latter

2007developments are of a structural nature, they are 
likely to continue to exert upward pressure on 

global food prices in the future. The increases 

in the prices of dairy products may have also 

reß ected the differing structure of the milk 
market across European countries, in addition 

to the price increases in global markets for milk, 

animal feed and other inputs.Underscoring the global nature of the food price shock, food prices increased simultaneously 
in several major economies outside the euro 
area in 2007. Furthermore, the food price 
components that contributed most to euro area 
inß ation (such as cereals and dairy products) 
also rose in these economies, suggesting that a 
common shock lay behind the price increases.Within the euro area, the impact of the global food price shock on prices in individual euro area 
countries differed considerably in terms of both speed and size. For example, the annual rate 
of increase of HICP processed food excluding tobacco in 2007 ranged from 5.7% in Slovenia 
Œ the highest rate within the euro area Œ to 0.7% in France and 0.8% in Finland, where the rate 
was signiÞ cantly below the euro area average (see the table). More recent data show stronger 
processed food price inß ation in the latter two countries.
Retail food markets are traditionally segmented across countries. In this respect, differences in 
demand conditions, market structures, food price levels and competitive pressures in the retail 
and distribution sectors are likely to explain the diverse reactions of consumer food prices across 
countries to the common external shock.Chart B Developments in food and tropical

2007LOWER AVERAGE PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION 
BUT UPWARD PRESSURE TOWARDS THE END 

OF 2007Producer price inß ation declined in the 
Þ rst part of the year, mainly on account of base 
effects from the energy component, and rose 
thereafter, pushed up by energy and food price 
developments. The annual rate of change in industrial 
producer prices (excluding construction) in 

the euro area was 2.8% in 2007, considerably 

lower than in the previous two years. 

Producer price inß ation, which had peaked at 
6% in July 2006, gradually declined to stand 

at 1.8% in July 2007, mainly on account of 
base effects affecting the energy component. 

From September 2007 higher annual rates of 

energy producer price growth Œ pushed up 

by oil price increases and base effects Œ and 

food producer price growth led to an increase 

in producer price inß ation. In December 2007 
producer price inß ation stood at 4.3%.
The annual growth rate of industrial producer 
prices excluding construction and energy 
declined somewhat in the course of the year, but 
remained at elevated levels. This development 
reß ected different patterns in the main 
components (see Chart 26). The annual rate of growth of intermediate goods prices continued to slow down gradually over the 
course of 2007, declining to 3.5% in December 
from a peak of 6.5% in August 2006. In the Þ rst part of the year intermediate goods prices were 
still affected by upward pressure from higher 
prices of industrial raw materials, which constitute 
their main drivers. The subsequent decline in 
industrial raw materials prices on world markets, 
together with the appreciation of the euro, 
dampened price developments in many parts of 
the intermediate goods sector. Manufacturers 
of food-related items experienced strong price 
increases in the third quarter of the year in the 
wake of surging prices for some agricultural 
commodities in world markets (see Box 5). The 
annual growth in capital goods prices reversed its 
upward movement in June 2007 and declined to 
1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2007, reß ecting the favourable effects of the appreciation of the 
euro.Further down the production chain, consumer 
goods prices continued on the upward path 

observed since mid-2005. The annual rate of 

change in overall consumer goods prices rose 
Looking ahead, the outlook for both world and domestic food prices remains highly uncertain. 
Although the supply of agricultural products should eventually respond to the increase in demand, 
the catch-up period may be more prolonged than currently envisaged. Moreover, food prices 
depend on a number of factors which are difÞ cult to predict, including technology advances and 
possible changes in energy policy. Overall, risks seem to be on the upside.Chart 26 Breakdown of industrial producer

2007to 3.9% in December 2007, the highest rate 
of increase since the beginning of Monetary 

Union in 1999. This development was mainly 

driven by non-durable consumer goods 

prices, which accelerated from July onwards, 

reß ecting global food price pressures which 
pushed up food consumer goods prices. 

Excluding tobacco and food prices, however, 

the annual rate of change in consumer goods 

prices remained stable throughout the year, 

hovering around 1.3%.LABOUR COSTS REMAINED MODERATEThe annual growth rate of compensation per 
employee remained moderate in 2007. The 
average annual growth rate in the Þ rst three 
quarters of the year was 2.0%, slightly lower 
than the average growth rate recorded in 2006 
(see Table 2). Sectoral data indicate that, as in 
the previous year, growth rates in compensation 
per employee in 2007 were higher in the 
industrial sector than in the services sector, in 
line with sectoral productivity developments 
(see Chart 27). In the industrial sector, the 
average growth rate in the Þ rst three quarters 
of 2007 was broadly in line with developments 
since the beginning of 2006. The annual rate of 
growth of compensation per employee in the 
construction sector, although slightly higher than 
in the industrial sector, moderated in the course 
of the year amid the Þ rst signs of a slowdown in 
employment in this sector. The annual growth 
rate of compensation per employee in services 
in the Þ rst three quarters of 2007 was lower than 
in the previous two years.The average growth in total hourly labour costs 
in the Þ rst three quarters of 2007 was lower than 
the growth rate recorded in 2006. The moderation 
of annual growth rates of compensation per 
employee and total hourly labour costs was 
partially due to the dampening effects of cuts 
in social security contributions which were 
implemented in some euro area economies 
in 2007.Other available labour cost indicators conÞ rm that wage developments remained moderate in 2007. In particular, negotiated wage growth 
stood at 2.1% on average in the euro area in 2007, 
slightly below the rate in 2006, although wage 
developments varied considerably from country Table 2 Labour cost indicators(annual percentage changes)2005200620072006

2007to country. The impact of lower unemployment on wage agreements appears to have remained 
relatively moderate. It appears that structural 
reforms in labour and product markets, changes 
in the composition of the labour supply and 
employment, and international competition have 
contributed to the continuation of moderate 
labour cost developments in the euro area. Despite moderate wage developments, the annual 
growth rate of unit labour costs rose slightly in 

the course of the year, mainly reß ecting declining 
labour productivity growth. Unit labour costs grew 

by an average of 1.1% in the Þ rst three quarters of 
2007, compared with average growth rates of 0.9% 

and 1.0% in the previous two years. The increase 

in unit labour costs brought about some slowdown 

in proÞ t developments in the course of 2007. The 
indicator of overall proÞ t mark-up, measured as the 
difference in the rates of growth of the GDP deß ator 
and of unit labour costs, still signalled dynamic 

growth in proÞ ts up to the third quarter of 2007, 
but at a lower rate than in 2006. Average proÞ tmark-up growth in the Þ rst three quarters of 2007 
was 0.6%, whereas it had been 0.8% in 2006. 
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICE INCREASES 

SLOWED DOWN FURTHER 
Residential property prices, which are not included 

in the measurement of the HICP, decelerated in 
the Þ rst half of 2007, continuing the slowing trend 
observed in the second half of 2005 and in 2006 

(see Chart 28). According to the latest estimates, 

the annual growth rate of residential property 

prices for the euro area as a whole declined to 5.0% 

in the Þ rst half of 2007, from 6.1% in the second 
half of 2006. Available country data suggest that 

the moderation in euro area house price inß ation 
was particularly marked in those countries that 

have recorded relatively high residential property 

price rises in recent years, such as Belgium, 

Ireland, Spain, France and Malta. By contrast, 

in the case of Italy, the Netherlands and Austria, 

available data suggest that house price increases 

in 2007 were roughly unchanged compared with 

those recorded in 2006. As regards Germany, 

house prices recorded a further small increase in 

2007, following a period of subdued developments 

until 2005. 
DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION PERCEPTIONS AND 

EXPECTATIONSIn view of the rise in headline inß ation towards the 
end of 2007, inß ation perceptions and expectations 
became a key issue in the assessment of future 

inß ation developments. The European 
Commission™s measure of consumers™ qualitative 

perceptions of inß ation over the previous 12

20072007 following the rise in actual inß ation, reaching 
levels last seen in the wake of the euro cash 
changeover in January 2002 (see Chart 29).6 In 
contrast to 2002, consumers™ inß ation expectations 
for the next 12 months increased Œ although by a 

smaller amount Œ in the second half of 2007. 

Similarly, information derived from professional 

forecasters indicated that survey-based long-term 

inß ation expectations remained at 1.9% according 
to the October 2007 Consensus Economics 

forecasts and increased to 2.0% according to the 

January 2008 Euro Zone Barometer and the ECB 

Survey of Professional Forecasters for the Þ rst 
quarter of 2008. Furthermore, break-even inß ation 
rates derived from inß ation-linked bonds and 
swaps in the euro area increased after 

September 2007, suggesting a rise in inß ation 
expectations or inß ation risk premia in 
Þ nancial 
markets (see also Section 2.2 of this chapter).2.4 OUTPUT, DEMAND AND LABOUR MARKET 
DEVELOPMENTS 
ECONOMIC GROWTH DEVELOPED FAVOURABLY IN 

2007Economic developments in 2007 were 
favourable overall, although growth slowed 
somewhat in the course of the year. On average, 
real GDP growth in the euro area was 2.6% in 
2007, which is slightly below the 2.8% recorded 
in 2006 and above the growth rates recorded in 
previous years (see Chart 30).The slower GDP growth in 2007 was mainly due to developments in private 
consumption and residential investment. The 
contribution of net exports to GDP growth was 
0.4 percentage point, twice the contribution in 
2006 (see Table 3). Among the factors underlying this slower 
growth Œ besides the one-off impact on 

consumption of a VAT increase in Germany 

Œ of particular signiÞ cance was the negative 
impact of higher food and energy prices on 

the real disposable income of households and 

on consumer and business conÞ dence. These 
inß ation developments and, subsequently, 
the Þ nancial turmoil which commenced 
in August and was closely linked to the
sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States 

contributed to a deterioration in consumer and 

business expectations in the second half of 

2007. In addition, weakening conditions in the 

housing markets of several euro area countries 

contributed to a moderation in economic 

activity.Despite the growing uncertainty during the second half of the year, the euro area economy 
performed well in 2007, as reß ected in the 
sizeable and steady decline in the unemployment 
rate. The euro area unemployment rate fell to 
7.1% in December, which constitutes the lowest 
level observed in the past 25 years. This positive 
trend reß ects the strength of the fundamentals

2007of the euro area economy and, in particular, the proÞ tability of 
Þ rms and robust job creation. 
Private consumption grew by 1.4% in 2007, 
down from 1.8% in 2006. The consumption 
growth path in 2007 was strongly inß uenced by a VAT increase in Germany in January 
2007. This led to purchases being made earlier, 
particularly purchases of expensive items such 
as durable consumer goods, in order to avoid 
the tax increase. As a result, the annual growth 
rate of euro area private consumption declined 
sharply to 1.4% in the Þ rst quarter of 2007, from 
2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Household 
consumption rebounded in subsequent months, 
in line with improvements in real household 
disposable income which were mainly driven by 
the positive developments in employment and, 
to a lesser extent, by growth in household real 
wealth. The second half of the year witnessed a 
progressive weakening in consumer conÞ dence, which appears to have been linked to the 
turmoil in Þ nancial markets, concerns about the external environment and the rise in inß ation (see Chart 31). However, the Þ nancial turmoil 
is considered to have had only a limited direct 
impact on consumption, although consumer 
credit standards were tightened in the last 
few months of the year, in contrast to the net 
easing of credit standards observed in previous 
quarters. Having rebounded strongly in 2006, total investment growth was robust in 2007, at 4.4% 
for the year as a whole. However, the pace of 

growth gradually moderated in the course of the 

year. The deceleration was most pronounced in 

residential investment, marking the end of the 

expansionary phase of the business cycle in the 

construction sector in the context of a slowdown 

in house price growth. The deceleration in 

housing investment was more marked in certain 

countries which had experienced very fast growth 

in previous years. As reported in the Eurosystem™s 

bank lending survey, net demand for housing 

loans to households dropped considerably in the

assessments of housing market prospects and the 
deterioration in consumer conÞ dence. 
Euro area exports expanded robustly by 5.9% 
in 2007, reß ecting the strong growth of external 
demand, despite the rapid appreciation of the euro 
observed during the year and strong competition 
from China and other Asian countries. Euro 
area imports also grew strongly, boosted by the 
robust performance of business investment and 
exports and also by the appreciation of the euro. 
Overall, net trade made a positive contribution 
of 0.4 percentage point to GDP growth.From a sectoral perspective, economic 
activity in 2007 was mainly supported by the 

sustained performance of services, with the 

annual growth rate of this sector decreasing 

slightly from 2.5% in 2006 to 2.4% in 2007. 

The industrial sector (excluding construction) 

showed considerable resilience throughout the 

year which was closely related to the robust 

growth of exports, and this offset the slowdown 

in construction activity. Value added growth 

in the euro area construction sector declined 

sharply in 2007, particularly in the second 

half of the year. As mentioned above, this

2007trend was mainly the result of the deterioration 
in expectations regarding housing markets, 

although other construction activities Œ 

including non-residential building and civil 

engineering Œ also experienced slower growth. 
FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN THE LABOUR MARKETThe euro area labour market has shown a clear 

improvement in recent years. In 2006, after 

years of subdued growth, employment 

increased by 1.5%. Job creation was also more 

balanced across age, gender and skill groups.7 This strong employment growth continued 

in 2007, with the annual growth rate of 1.7% 

being the highest seen since 2001 

(see Table 4). However, employment growth 

declined in the second half of 2007, reß ecting 
weaker economic conditions.From a sectoral perspective, the faster employment growth in 2007 partly reß ected strong job creation in the construction sector, 
which posted an annual growth rate of 4.3% 
in the third quarter of 2007, up from 2.7% in 
2006 as a whole. The protracted contraction of 
employment in industry (excluding construction) 
came to a halt in 2007 when, for the Þ rst time 
since 2001, net job creation Œ albeit very modest 
Œ was observed. Employment in services also 
grew faster, rising to 2.2% in the third quarter of 
2007 from an average of 2.1% in 2006. This was 
mainly related to developments in the Þ nance and business and trade and transport sub-
sectors. In the second half of 2007 these services 
sub-sectors experienced slower employment 
growth, as did the construction sector, where 
the slowdown was more pronounced. The 
developments in the latter sector reß ect the end 
of the cyclical upswing in housing and other 
construction activities. The unemployment rate, which started to decline at the beginning of 2005 and stood at 7.9% in 
the fourth quarter of 2006, decreased further 
in 2007, falling to 7.1% at the end of the year 
(see Chart 32).The average monthly decline in the number of unemployed persons during 2007 stood at around 
80,000. Overall, lower unemployment reß ects employment growth associated with cyclical 
conditions as well as the impact of market 
reforms and continued wage moderation. Labour productivity growth for the economy 
as a whole, as measured by real GDP divided 

by total employment, increased by just 0.8% 

in 2007, down from 1.3% in 2006 when labour 

productivity peaked in the fourth quarter at an 

annual growth rate of 1.6%. The acceleration 

in labour productivity seen in 2006, which was 

mainly associated with the cyclical upswing 

of the euro area economy, proved to be 

short-lived and the annual growth rate fell to 

0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007.

2007Box 6THE DECLINE IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE EURO AREA IN RECENT YEARS
For the last nine years employment growth in the euro area has expanded by a 1.3% annual average growth rate. Since the second quarter of 2003, the euro area unemployment rate has 
fallen by 1.5 percentage points, to stand at 7.2% in December 2007. This decline reß ects not 
only the economic upturn but also the effect of sustained moderate wage developments as well 
as reforms in the euro area labour market. Two periods can be identiÞ ed regarding unemployment developments in recent years (see Chart A). 
First, a period from mid-2003 to early 2005, during which the unemployment rate continued 
to increase slowly in spite of the acceleration in activity. This followed a period in which the 

unemployment rate increased sharply from a low of 7.8% in mid-2001 to 8.7% in mid-2003. Then 

a second period, from early 2005 to 2007, in which the unemployment rate fell markedly in a 

context of sustained economic growth, bringing the rate to levels not seen since the early 1980s. In 

absolute terms, unemployment has declined by around 1.6 million since June 2003, absorbing the 

increase recorded from mid-2001 to mid-2003. This box reviews the decline in unemployment in 

the euro area since 2003, focusing in particular on age, gender, skills and duration patterns.Strong employment growth largely accounts for the decline in unemployment
The decline in unemployment stemmed from the vigorous growth in employment. Total employment 
has been growing at an average quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.3% since mid-2003, compared with only 0.1% between mid-2001 and mid-2003. This corresponds to an increase of more than 

7.5 million employed. At the sectoral level, the services sector was responsible for around 85% 

of the increase in employment, while the remainder was created in the construction sector. 

Employment in agriculture and industry excluding construction remained on a declining trend. 
It is worth noting that the decline in unemployment occurred against the 
background of an ongoing increase in the 
labour force, although in the last two years this 
showed some signs of decelerating. Mainly 
on account of an increasing participation rate, 
labour force growth has remained sustained 
since early 2003 at an average annual rate 
of slightly above 0.9%. In other words, the 
dynamism of employment since 2003 not only 
absorbed the increasing labour force but also 
led to a signiÞ cant decline in unemployment.

2007most affected by high unemployment, i.e. young people and women. However, differences in unemployment rates across groups are still signiÞ cant (see the table). 
Youth unemployment (unemployment of those aged under 25) Œ which in the euro area is around 
twice as high as the overall unemployment rate Œ has decreased, from 16.5% in June 2003 to 
14.3% in December 2007. Overall, around a third of the total decrease in unemployment is 
attributable to this group. The female unemployment rate fell by 1.9 percentage points, to 8.0%, 
between June 2003 and December 2007, clearly a more pronounced decline than that recorded 
for male workers. Both groups, youths and women, have continued to beneÞ t from the easing 
of regulations applicable to Þ xed-term contracts and the introduction of measures aimed at 
promoting part-time employment, which have increased these groups™ employability. They have 
also beneÞ ted from the structural rise in employment in the services sector. 
On a less positive note, the ratio of long-term unemployed to the total number of unemployed persons 

appears to have remained broadly unchanged between 2003 and 2007, at slightly above 44%, which is 

very high compared with other economic areas. However, the ratio of those unemployed for more than 

a year to total unemployment has decreased by 1.0 percentage point since 2005. This indicates that 

persons in that group are beneÞ ting from the economic recovery with some lag. As re
ß ected in the trend 
decline, long-term unemployment is also beneÞ ting from labour market reforms aimed in particular at 
improving the employability of the most vulnerable groups and at increasing work incentives.Additional reforms and continuing wage moderation are necessary to encourage a further 
decline in unemploymentOverall, the decline in unemployment since mid-2003 has been signiÞ cant. A sustainable continuation of this decline in the coming years will necessitate, in addition to wage moderation, ongoing reforms in euro area labour and product markets. The European Commission has recently 
compiled a database (called LABREF), recording the key features of policy initiatives since the 
year 2000, focusing on their design, scope and durability.1 Chart B shows that on average the 1 Reforms have been classi
Þ ed along eight main policy dimensions, covering labour taxation, the unemployment bene
Þ t systems 
(together with other welfare-related beneÞ ts), active labour market programmes, job protection, pension systems, wage bargaining, 
working time organisation, migration policies and labour mobility; within these broad policy domains, an overall set of 36 areas of 
intervention are investigated.Unemployment rates in the euro area by gender, age group and skills(percentages; percentage points)Age200320052007Change 2003-07All above 158.79.07.2-1.5Men above 157.78.26.5-1.2Women above 159.910.08.0-1.9Younger 15-2416.517.614.3-2.2Older 55-647.47.56.1-1.3Skills 25-64below secondary education 10.310.29.1-1.2at least secondary education 7.77.96.2-1.5tertiary education 5.25.04.0-1.2Long-term unemployment rate above 1544.245.444.40.2Source: Eurostat.Note: Data for 2003, 2005 and 2007 refer to June, March and December respectively and are derived from the harmonised unemployment rate for all categories, except older workers, the skills breakdown and long-term unemployment, for which the data refer to March in all

2007majority of countries, most notably in Germany, Luxembourg and Finland. Against this background, the average government 
debt ratio in the euro area declined by close to 
2 percentage points to a level of 66.7% of 
GDP, the lowest debt level as a percentage of 
GDP since the start of Stage Three of EMU in 
1999. France and low-debt countries Ireland 
and Luxembourg were the exceptions to this 
declining trend. Moreover, in six countries debt 
ratios remained above the 60% of GDP reference 
value. Despite improved Þ scal outcomes, there 
was an increase in debt issuance activity of euro 
area governments in 2007 (see Box 7). The average structural budget balance (the cyclically adjusted balance excludingone-off and other temporary measures) in the 
euro area improved from -1.2% of GDP in 
2006 to -0.8% in 2007. Rather than concrete 
consolidation measures on the expenditure 
side, this improvement reß ected buoyant tax 
revenue growth over and above the growth 
that can be explained by developments in the 
assumed macroeconomic tax bases. Looking at 
individual countries, a substantial improvement 
in structural balances, of 0.5 percentage point 
of GDP or more, was seen in Germany, Greece, 
Italy, Portugal and Slovenia. By contrast, there 
was signiÞ cant structural budgetary loosening, 
of over 1 percentage point of GDP, in Ireland 
and the Netherlands. A small majority of euro 
area countries reached or continued to meet 
their medium-term budgetary objective (MTO)

2007Box 7DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ISSUANCE OF GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES AND BOND YIELD SPREADS IN 
THE EURO AREA 
In an environment of rising interest rates, which characterised most of the year, euro area net 
issuance of general government debt securities increased in 2007. The increase was remarkably 
strong for short-term issuance. In net terms, the growth rate of euro area general government 
debt issuance was 2.8% in December 2007, or only 0.4 percentage point higher than in 2006 
(see Table A).1 However, the general government debt-to-GDP ratio declined in most euro area countries, in the context of stronger economic growth.One reason for the 2007 percentage increase in governments™ issuance of short-term debt securities relative to long-term debt securities could be the rise in long-term interest rates in 
the Þ rst half of the year. Accordingly, as governments were faced with a steep yield curve, 
the annual growth rate of long-term debt securities fell from 3.4% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2007, 
while the annual growth rate of short-term debt securities rose sharply, and even turned 
positive in 2007. An analysis of the structure of outstanding general government debt securities reveals that government debt issuance is undertaken predominantly by central government. In 2007 it 
accounted for 93.5% of outstanding debt securities, while the other general government 
sub-sectors were responsible for the remaining 6.5%. The latter, however, have become more 
active over time, their issuance of debt securities having more or less doubled during the years 
1999-2006, while that of central government declined steadily over the same period. In general, countries have not changed their long-term debt management orientation. In 2007 long-term debt accounted for around 92.5% of outstanding debt securities, which is 
slightly less than in 2006. The share of short-term debt securities, however, increased from 
7.1% in 2006 to 7.5% in 2007 (see Table B). Table B also indicates that by far the largest 
proportion of long-term general government debt securities was issued at a Þ xed rate. 
The share of ß oating rate issues increased slightly in 2007, thus continuing the upward trend that 
started in 2004. 1 Growth rates are calculated on the basis of 
Þ nancial transactions and therefore exclude reclassi
Þ cations, revaluations, exchange rate 
variations and other changes that do not arise from transactions. For details, see the technical notes relating to Tables 4.3 and 4.4 of the

2007In order to illustrate the effect of rising interest rates on general government debt interest payments, 
the change in interest payments can be decomposed as follows: i) an effect stemming from changes in 

government debt, ii) an effect resulting from changes in interest rates and iii) a residual cross effect.2 Chart A shows that in 2007, for the Þ rst time since 2000, there was a positive contribution from the 
change in interest rates to the overall change in interest payments. Moreover, the impact of the change 

in interest rates was higher than the effect from the change in debt.In terms of cross-country differences, German ten-year government bond yields have thus far been 
the lowest among euro area countries on average, primarily on account of these bonds™ higher 

liquidity and corresponding benchmark status. Chart B shows the government bond yield spreads 

for the euro area countries other than Germany under the excessive deÞ cit procedure at the end of 
2006, against German bonds. 
The differences between government bond yields across euro area countries ultimately reß ect differences in liquidity and credit risk. There were two discernible trends in government bond yield spreads during 2007. In the Þ rst half of the year, government bond yield spreads were on 
a downward trend in some euro area countries. However, during the Þ nancial market turmoil in the second half of 2007 and as a result of a general repricing of risks, they increased, particularly 
in Greece, France, Italy and Portugal. The declines that were observed towards the end of 
September were reversed in November, following investors™ renewed concerns regarding the 
turmoil in credit markets. In order to conÞ rm the recent widening of the government bond yield spreads, Chart C shows 
sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads. By construction, sovereign CDS spreads can also be considered as measures of the credit risk associated with holding corresponding government 2 The change in interest payments,

2007STANDSTILL IN FISCAL CONSOLIDATION EXPECTED 
IN 2008 
Fiscal plans in euro area countries for 2008, 
as included in the stability programme updates 
of end-2007, indicate that the decline in the 
average government deÞ cit in the euro area, 
observed since 2004, will come to a halt, with 
the deÞ cit marginally increasing to 0.9% of 
GDP. Government expenditure and revenues 
would both decrease by approximately the same 
amount (0.25 percentage point of GDP). With 
economic growth expected to be broadly in 
line with potential, the near stabilisation of the 
euro area average deÞ cit re
ß ects a slowdown 
or even a reversal of consolidation efforts in 
some countries and a reduction of surpluses in  

others. Against this background, the average 
government debt ratio in the euro area is 
expected to decline less rapidly in 2008, by 
around 1.5 percentage points, to 65.1% of GDP.In more detail, no substantial consolidation 
progress towards sound public Þ nances is 
expected in France and Italy, leaving their 

headline deÞ cits rather close to the 3% of GDP 
reference value, as is the case in Portugal. Progress 

in the other countries that have not yet reached 

their MTO would be rather limited on average, 
bonds. For the speciÞ c purpose at hand, 
sovereign CDS spreads have the advantage 
of not being distorted by changes in the 
benchmark bonds of the countries concerned, 
of not being affected by any maturity mismatch, 
and of tending to be more responsive to market 
changes. In line with the above analysis on 
government bond yield spreads, CDS spreads 
for the above-mentioned countries have also 
increased since the summer of 2007, and in 
early 2008 continued this upward trend. Chart A Decomposition of the change in

MORE AMBITION IN FISCAL CONSOLIDATION 

EFFORTS ESSENTIALAccording to the updated stability programmes, 

the macroeconomic environment in 2008 

remains conducive to swift progress towards 

the MTOs set by the euro area countries. The 

Stability and Growth Pact calls on the euro 

area countries to attain annual improvements of 

the structural budget balance of 0.5% of GDP 

as a benchmark, with greater consolidation 

efforts to be undertaken in good times. In 

April 2007 the Eurogroup ministers reafÞ rmed 
their commitment to pursue sound Þ scal policies 
in line with the provisions of the Stability and 

Growth Pact. They recognised that the euro 

area was experiencing economic good times 

and undertook to make full use of the expected 

benign economic environment and the better 

than expected tax revenues to speed up the 

pace of deÞ cit and debt reduction. Eurogroup 
ministers committed to the objective that 

most euro area members would achieve their 

MTO in 2008 or 2009 and all of them should 

aim for 2010 at the latest. Member countries 

that had already achieved their MTO were 

expected to maintain this strong budgetary 

position so as to avoid Þ scal loosening in good 
times. In October 2007 the ECOFIN Council 

agreed on a number of welcome measures to 

improve the effectiveness of the Stability and 

Growth Pact, in particular by strengthening 

its preventive arm. They also conÞ rmed the 
need to comply with the Pact™s structural 

consolidation benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per 

year. Uncertainty surrounding the impact of 

the Þ nancial market turbulence, which began 
in summer 2007, on the economy and on 

the budget suggests that greater prudence is 

warranted in setting Þ scal policies.
Euro area countries still subject to the excessive 
deÞ cit procedure should bring their de
Þ cit ratios below the 3% of GDP reference value 
in a sustainable manner. They should also comply both with the benchmark improvement 
in the structural balance of 0.5% of GDP and 
with additional consolidation requirements 
included in the respective ECOFIN Council 
recommendations. To avoid the risk of exceeding 
the deÞ cit reference value in the near future, 
it is essential to continue progressing towards 
sound public Þ nances after having reduced the 
deÞ cit to below 3% of GDP. Otherwise, adverse 
developments might cause the deÞ cit to quickly exceed that value again. Current projections, 
as included in the stability programmes of the 
two countries subject to an excessive deÞ cit procedure, Italy and Portugal, indicate that 
deÞ cits would be below 3% of GDP in 2008 but 
would remain rather high, warranting further 
consolidation. Other euro area countries that did not reach their medium-term objective in 2007 should 
pursue a consolidation strategy in line with 
the requirements of the Stability and Growth 
Pact. This requires a structural consolidation 
of 0.5% of GDP per annum as a benchmark, 
with greater consolidation efforts to be 
undertaken if countries experience good times. 
In addition, as noted above, euro area countries 
should reach their MTO by 2010 at the latest. 
Compliance with these political commitments 
appears limited, based on the latest update of 
the stability programmes. In particular, Ireland, 
Greece, France and Italy are not expected to 
reach their MTO by 2010, and the structural 
Þ scal adjustment in 2008 would fall short of the 
0.5% of GDP benchmark in Belgium, France, 
Italy and Austria. These developments are 
all the more disappointing as some countries 
continue to beneÞ t from exceptionally buoyant 
revenues that enhance the structural budget 
balances, although their persistence is far 
from certain. Failure to meet the requirements 
of the Stability and Growth Pact and recent 
political commitments put the credibility of the 
preventive arm of the Pact at serious risk. It is advisable that those euro area countries 
that have already reached their MTO avoid pro-
cyclical Þ scal policies, which would fuel in
ß ation 
and macroeconomic imbalances, in good times. 
76ECBAnnual Report
2007The free operation of automatic stabilisers 
would help to smoothen out macroeconomic 

ß uctuations. Some countries that achieved their 
MTO in 2007 are planning to depart from this 

structural budgetary position in 2008. 
More determined efforts in euro area countries to achieve and maintain sound public Þ nances are 
not only warranted from the viewpoint of short-
term macroeconomic stabilisation, by allowing 
a free play of automatic stabilisers, but also 
because of the need to enhance long-term Þ scal sustainability. A lower government debt burden 
would partially compensate for the expenditure 
pressure resulting from an ageing population in 
the decades ahead. Other measures needed to 
enhance Þ scal sustainability relate to reforms 
in the areas of health care and pension systems 
as well as to increasing effective labour supply. 
Failure to act in a timely manner to address the budgetary consequences of ageing will put Þ scal sustainability at risk and increase the burden on 
future generations.Indications that part of the buoyant revenue 
growth has been used to fuel additional 

government spending in some countries point 

to the risk of expansionary Þ scal policies 
and a repetition of the policy mistakes of 

2000-01 when safety margins were eroded, 

causing several countries to enter the 

excessive deÞ cit procedure once economic 
conditions deteriorated (see Box 8). In this 

regard, a binding national medium-term 

Þ scal framework, if properly designed and 
rigorously implemented, can help to counter 

domestic pressure to use revenue windfalls for 

additional spending or tax cuts, and contribute 

to the creation of a sufÞ ciently large budgetary 
buffer below the 3% of GDP reference value. 
Box 8LEARNING FROM THE FISCAL POLICY EXPERIENCE OF 2000-01
In 2007 the euro area general government deÞ cit is expected to have declined to 0.8% of GDP. 
Excluding the impact of proceeds from the sales of UMTS licences, this is a lower level than that 
reached in 2000, at the peak of the previous economic cycle (see Chart A). Looking ahead, a key 
issue for Þ scal policy is to avoid a repetition of the experience in the early part of this decade 
when Þ scal positions deteriorated rapidly and a number of euro area countries incurred excessive 
deÞ cits. In this regard, past experience points to a tendency to overestimate the strength of the 
underlying budgetary position in good times, which calls for a particularly prudent Þ scal policy when economic conditions are favourable. In 1999-2000, at the peak of the last economic cycle, a number of countries adopted expansionary Þ scal policy measures (primarily tax cuts). These measures were deemed to be ﬁaffordableﬂ in 
view of the favourable economic projections and estimates of underlying (cyclically adjusted) 
budgetary positions available at the time. With hindsight, however, the strength of countries™ 
underlying Þ scal positions was overestimated. As the euro area economy unexpectedly entered 
a downturn, Þ scal balances deteriorated rapidly and several countries soon exceeded the 3% of 
GDP deÞ cit reference value (see Chart B, left panel). 
Two technical problems hamper the accurate estimation of the ﬁtrueﬂ cyclically adjusted budget 
balance. The Þ rst relates to the dif
Þ culty of assessing the cyclical position of the economy in 
real time. In autumn 2000 the European Commission, as well as most professional forecasters, 
expected the Þ scal position of the euro area to continue to improve. This assessment was based 
on the assumption that the output gap Œ and hence the cyclical component of the budget balance Œ 77ECBAnnual Report
2007was close to zero and that in the near future economic conditions would continue to exert a positive inß uence on the budget balance. In fact, as of 2001, the euro area economy entered a 
downturn. This gave rise to considerable ex post revisions of estimates of both the output gap 
and the cyclical component of the budget balance (see Chart B, right-hand panel). Hence the 
Þ nal outcome for 2000 in fact re
ß ected a strong positive cyclical impact of approximately 1% of 
GDP. By contrast, the cyclical contribution was estimated to be zero in that year.Another reason relates to uncertainty regarding the behaviour of tax revenues over the 
economic cycle. Current forecasting and cyclical adjustment methodologies generally assume 

a fairly stable relationship between the growth rate of tax revenues and the growth rate of GDP 

or, in disaggregated methodologies, the growth rate of other macroeconomic bases, which 

are also national accounts aggregates. During boom periods, however, taxes on proÞ ts and 
capital gains in particular have been shown to grow at a much faster rate than the assumed 

macroeconomic bases and then decline sharply during the subsequent downturn. The occurrence 

and magnitude of such effects can hardly be predicted given that they depend on factors such 

as the timing of the realisation of capital gains and complex tax rules, which usually allow 

proÞ ts in one year to be offset against losses in previous years. A breakdown of changes in the 
ratio of government revenue to GDP since 2000 suggests that revenue losses in 2000 and 2001 

were mainly attributable to tax cuts, but these were then exacerbated by other factors which 

depressed tax revenues, especially in 2002. By contrast, in 2005 and 2006 the revenue-to-GDP 

ratio increased signiÞ cantly, despite a relative lack of tax-increasing measures. The potential 
for such revenues to disappear in the near future represents a downside risk to the current 

Þ scal outlook. 
Given these experiences, an important lesson from the Þ scal policy misjudgements of 
2000-01 is that one should beware of interpreting budgetary improvements in good times as 
being structural, even if changes in cyclically adjusted budget balances point in this direction. 
Rather, and as agreed by the Eurogroup in April 2007, unexpectedly high tax revenues in good 
times should be allocated to deÞ cit and debt reduction rather than be used to increase spending or 
cut taxes in a potentially unsustainable manner. Chart A Fiscal developments, 1998-2007(as a percentage of GDP)2007200620052004200320022001200019991998

2007To that end, such rules need to be drawn up 
ex ante, and could include rules allocating 

exceptional surplus revenues to deÞ cit and debt 
reduction. Higher spending in priority areas or 

cuts in taxes and social security contributions 

to increase the quality of public Þ nances 
should be Þ nanced primarily via expenditure 
reductions to avoid increases in the tax burden 

and/or Þ scal de
Þ cits. Increasing ef
Þ ciency in 
the provision of government services in general, 

and in public administration in particular, as 

well as in government revenue structures, is an 

effective way to release budget resources for 

more productive purposes.2.6 EXCHANGE RATES AND BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
THE EURO CONTINUED TO APPRECIATE IN 2007 

IN EFFECTIVE TERMS 
After having receded somewhat from its end-
2004 peak in the course of 2005, the nominal 
effective exchange rate of the euro largely 
recovered in the course of 2006. Initially, the 
euro continued to appreciate in 2007, building 
on the strengthening momentum of the previous 
year. The appreciation trend was brieß y interrupted between May and mid-August, when 
the euro moved within a relatively narrow range. 
In the context of the global Þ nancial market 
turmoil, the euro depreciated in August before 
experiencing a strong appreciation throughout 
the remainder of the year. By the year-end the 
euro was, in nominal effective terms, 6.3% 
stronger than its level at the beginning of January 
and 8.2% above its average level in 2006. The 
appreciation was particularly pronounced vis-
à-vis the US dollar. In addition, the euro also 
appreciated strongly against the pound sterling. 
A more moderate appreciation was recorded 
against the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi 
and the Swiss franc.The appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the 
US dollar was driven largely by a changing 

market assessment of the relative cyclical 

outlook for the two economic areas in 

favour of the euro area and developments in 
interest rate differentials. In addition, the 

persistently large US current account deÞ cit 
is likely to have contributed to some extent 

to the weakness of the US currency. In the 

early months of the year, relatively robust 

data releases for the euro area contrasted 

with a more mixed data environment for 

the United States, which led to a narrowing 

of interest rate differentials between the 

two areas. From May to mid-August the 

euro/US dollar exchange rate underwent some 

ß uctuations as market participants revised 
their assessment of the relative cyclical 

strength of the two economies. After a short 

initial period of depreciation as a result of the 

Þ nancial turbulence triggered by concerns 
about liquidity conditions in global money 

and credit markets, the euro appreciated 

strongly against the US currency from late 

August to late November. The weakening of 

the US dollar appears to have been related 

to a downgrading of expectations for the 

growth outlook of the US economy by market 

participants, reß ecting, in particular, weaker 
than expected data releases for the US housing

2007and labour markets. After reaching USD 1.49 
on 27 November 2007, the single currency 

depreciated slightly to stand at USD 1.47 on 

31 December 2007, 11.8% stronger than at the 

beginning of that year.The euro also strengthened against the 
Japanese yen in 2007, amid some considerable 

short-term volatility. One of the main factors 

inß uencing the evolution of the Japanese 
currency appears to have been shifts in the 

attitude to risk by international investors 

and changes in the perceived attractiveness 

of ﬁcarry tradeﬂ transactions. Low Japanese 

interest rates and historically low implied 

volatility, combined with a favourable risk 

attitude of international investors, appear 

to have contributed to a signiÞ cant increase 
in the volume of outstanding carry trades. 

On 13 July the euro reached a high of 

JPY 168.68. This appreciation trend 

subsequently came to a halt in the context 

of the global Þ nancial turbulence, which 
led to a reappraisal of risk by international 

investors and appears to have contributed to 

a signiÞ cant unwinding of carry trades. From 
mid-August to mid-October, however, the 

euro strengthened again against the Japanese 

yen, while throughout the remainder of the 

year movements in the euro/yen exchange rate 

saw signiÞ cant volatility without any clear 
directional trend. On 31 December 2007 the 

euro stood at JPY 164.93, 5.1% higher than at 

the beginning of the year.The euro also appreciated noticeably against the pound sterling in 2007 (by 9.2%), with 
most of the appreciation being concentrated in 
the period between September and December. 
In late December 2007 the euro was trading at 
GBP 0.73, its highest level since the inception 
of the single currency in 1999. The weakening 
of the pound was reportedly related to market 
expectations of a further reduction in policy 
interest rates by the Bank of England in response 
to the less favourable Þ nancial and economic 
outlook. The euro also strengthened against the 

currencies of a number of Asian trading 

partners, reß ecting, in part, their formal or 
informal link to the US dollar. The euro 

appreciated markedly vis-à-vis the Korean won 

(12.5%) and the Hong Kong dollar (12.1%), 

and more moderately against the Singapore 

dollar (4.8%) and the Chinese renminbi 

(4.6%). The relatively contained appreciation 

against the Chinese currency reß ects, to some 
extent, the apparent greater willingness of 

the Chinese authorities to allow a stronger 

appreciation of their currency against the 

US dollar, especially towards the end of the 

year. The appreciation of the euro against 

these currencies was partly counterbalanced by 

the euro™s depreciation against the Polish zloty 

(by 6.2%), the Canadian dollar (by 5.4%), the 

Norwegian krone (by 3.4%) and the Czech 

koruna (by 3.1%).The real effective exchange rates of the euro  Œ based on different cost and price measures Œ 
also appreciated during 2007 (see Chart 33). 
In the last quarter of the year the real effective 
exchange rate of the euro, based on consumer 
prices, was about 5.5% above the level observed 
one year earlier.Chart 34 Current account balance and its

2007CURRENT ACCOUNT SHIFTED INTO SURPLUS IN 
2007In 2007 the current account of the euro area 

recorded a surplus of •15.0 billion (or 0.2% of 

euro area GDP), compared with a deÞ cit of •13.6 
billion in 2006. The shift largely resulted from an 

increase in the goods surplus of •37.3 billion and, 

to a lesser extent, from an increase in the surplus 

for services of •7.2 billion. These surpluses were 

only partly counterbalanced by a shift in the 

income account to a deÞ cit and an increase in the 
current transfers deÞ cit (see Chart 34).
After witnessing exceptionally strong growth 

rates in 2006, the value of extra-euro area trade 

in goods grew at a slower pace in 2007. The 

value of goods exports increased by 8.1% in 

2007, compared with growth of 14.3% in 2006. 

Meanwhile, the growth in goods imports showed 

a stronger deceleration, from 17.0% in 2006 to 

5.5% in 2007. This was one of the main factors 

behind the overall improvement in the euro area 

current account balance. Imports and exports of 

services, by contrast, grew more strongly in 2007 

than in 2006, partly counterbalancing the weaker 

growth in goods trade.According to the breakdown of trade in goods into volumes and prices, available up 
to November 2007, the deceleration in the growth rate of export values mainly reß ected developments in export volumes. Somewhat 
weaker growth in foreign demand and the 
appreciation of the euro contributed to the 
slowdown in extra-euro area exports in the 
Þ rst half of the year. Nevertheless, these 
developments may also be seen, to some 
extent, as a normalisation after a period of 
exceptionally strong growth at the end of 2006. 
Subsequently, growth in export volumes picked 
up in the third quarter of 2007, largely reß ecting a rebound in foreign demand. The geographical 
breakdown of euro area goods trade shows 
that exports towards Asia, especially China, 
and the central and eastern European countries 
continued to be particularly dynamic in 2007, 
amid strong economic activity in these regions. 
Export volumes to the United States declined 
in absolute terms (see Chart 35). Nevertheless, 
it appears that the appreciation of the euro has 
so far had a relatively contained impact on euro 
area export performance, with the latter mainly 
driven by continued robust growth in foreign 
demand. Meanwhile, export prices grew only 
moderately, indicating that euro area Þ rms might have adjusted their proÞ t margins to offset 
the decline in price and cost competitiveness 
resulting from the euro appreciation.On the imports side, import volumes followed similar trends to those of export volumes in 
2007. After subdued growth in the Þ rst half of 
the year, they accelerated in the second half, 
reß ecting the rebound in business investment 
and the appreciation of the euro. Meanwhile, 
import prices Œ following a signiÞ cant decline 
towards the end of 2006 Œ picked up again 
in 2007. This was mostly the result of the 
large increases in oil prices that were partly 
offset by the appreciation of the euro. In the 
12-month cumulated period up to October 2007, 
the oil trade deÞ cit stood at •161 billion, against 
•170 billion registered a year earlier.NET INFLOWS IN COMBINED DIRECT AND 

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT DECREASED IN 2007

20072007, compared with net inß ows of •140 billion 
a year earlier. This decline mainly reß ected a 
decrease in net inß ows in portfolio investment 
of •44 billion, which was counterbalanced, to some extent, by lower net outß ows in direct 
investment of •28 billion (see Chart 36). Lower net inß ows of debt securities, 
amounting to •60 billion as opposed to •124 
billion in 2006, accounted for most of the 

decrease in net portfolio inß ows and mainly 
reß ected considerably smaller net purchases 
of euro area bonds and notes by non-resident 

investors. However, this masks two distinct 

trend movements in the course of 2007. After 

a sharp increase in the early part of the year, 

net inß ows in debt instruments subsequently 
subsided.As for equity securities, the euro area registered higher net inß ows in 2007, amounting to 
•175 billion as opposed to •153 billion in 2006. 
This was mainly the result of considerably 
smaller net purchases of foreign equity by 
euro area residents (down from •156 billion to 
•50 billion), which were only partly offset by 
lower purchases of euro area equity by foreign 
investors.All in all, recent data seem to suggest that the 
Þ nancial account of the euro area was affected 
by the credit market turbulence that began 
in August 2007. Despite some rebound in 
October 2007, euro area and foreign investors 
appear to have reduced their foreign investments 
in both debt and equity instruments in the wake 
of the turmoil, possibly reß ecting more cautious 
foreign investment strategies.Turning to direct investment, the lower net outß ows in 2007 primarily re
ß ected higher 
foreign direct investment inß ows into the euro 
area. At the same time, direct investment abroad 
by euro area companies remained relatively 
strong. This reß ected the high pro
Þ tability of 
euro area multinational enterprises, which has 
steadily improved in the past few years. In 
addition, euro area Þ rms may have been taking 
advantage of the strengthening of the euro to 
buy assets abroad. Based on cumulated ß ows over four quarters, 
up to the third quarter of 2007 the main 
recipients of euro area direct investment 

were the United States, the United Kingdom, 

offshore Þ nancial centres, Switzerland and 
countries that have joined the EU since 2004.

INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION 

DETERIORATED FURTHER IN 2007Data on the international investment position 
of the euro area vis-à-vis the rest of the 
world, available up to the third quarter of 
2007, indicate that the euro area recorded net 
liabilities of •1,299 billion vis-à-vis the rest 
of the world (representing 14.8% of euro area 
GDP), compared with net liabilities of •1,024 
billion (12.1% of GDP) at the end of 2006 
(see Chart 37). This increase in net liabilities 
in 2007 resulted mainly from an increase in the 
net liability positions in portfolio investment 
(by •340 billion) and other investment (by 
•72 billion), which were offset by an increase 
in the net asset positions in direct investment 
(by •80 billion) and Þ nancial derivatives (by 
•43 billion). Reserve assets remained broadly 
unchanged.Overall, the increase in the euro area™s net international liability position was largely driven 
by revaluation effects resulting from asset price 
changes and movements in the euro exchange 
rate. An appreciation of the euro typically 
lowers the euro value of assets by more than the 
value of liabilities and leads to an increase in the 
net debtor position.83ECBAnnual Report
2007ECONOMIC ACTIVITY 
Real GDP growth in the non-euro area EU 
Member States remained robust in 2007 

(see Table 6).9 While this pattern of strong 
economic activity was widely observed across 

countries, annual growth rates differed 

considerably. Annual average real GDP growth 

was highest in the Baltic States and Slovakia, 

where it stood around 8%. In the Czech Republic, 

Poland and Romania, annual average real GDP 

growth was also very strong, at between 6.0% and 

6.5%. Real GDP growth was lowest in Denmark 

and Hungary, at 1.8% and 1.3% respectively. In 

Cyprus, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, 

growth remained robust between 2.8% and 4.4%. 
In most non-euro area EU Member States, 
economic activity was driven by domestic 

demand. Private consumption was spurred by 

increasing gains in real disposable income, 

associated with accelerated wage increases and 

rising employment. Growth in gross Þ xed capital 
formation beneÞ ted inter alia from an extended 
period of favourable Þ nancing conditions and 
a stronger inß ow of EU structural funds in 
many countries. In the majority of countries, 
rapid credit growth and an expansionary Þ scal 
stance also contributed to robust growth in 

domestic demand.Net exports contributed negatively to growth in 
most non-euro area EU Member States, 

despite solid growth in foreign demand, as 

strong demand for imports outpaced export 

growth. The contribution of net exports to real 

GDP growth was signiÞ cantly positive only 
in Hungary, Malta, Slovakia and Sweden. 

Overall, export growth in 2007 remained 

robust, although it decelerated in most countries 

compared with 2006. Growth in exports was 

supported by strong demand in key trading 

partners and sizeable foreign direct investment 

inß ows in recent years, while strong import 
growth was underpinned by robust domestic 

demand and the relatively high import content 

of exports. 
The non-euro area EU Member States referred to in this section 9 comprise the 14 EU Member States outside the euro area in the period to the end of December 2007 (i.e. Bulgaria, the

2007Along with the stronger economic activity, the labour market situation continued to 
improve in 2007 in most non-euro area
EU Member States. Unemployment rates 
continued their decline, mainly as a result of 
strong employment growth. Labour market 
conditions tightened further in many countries, 
particularly in the Baltic States, Denmark and 
the United Kingdom. International labour ß ows continued to affect the labour supply of many 
countries. Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland 
and Romania appear to have experienced 
particularly large labour outß ows in recent 
years. This was also the case in Estonia in 2007. 
These outß ows have contributed to skill 
shortages and bottlenecks in several sectors of 
the countries™ economies, thereby increasing 
wage pressures. By contrast, the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, 
Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom have 
experienced net positive migration ß ows. PRICE DEVELOPMENTSHICP inß ation increased signi
Þ cantly in many 
non-euro area EU Member States in 2007 
(see Table 7). Inß ation was highest in the fast-
growing Baltic States, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (between 4.9% and 10.1%), and 
stood close to or moderately above the euro 
area average in most other non-euro area EU 
Member States (between 0.7% and 3.0%). 
Average inß ation was below 2% in Denmark, 
Malta, Slovakia and Sweden in 2007, but picked 
up also in these countries towards the year-end 
owing primarily to increasing import prices for 
food and energy. The upward trend in inß ation in the non-
euro area EU Member States in 2007 was partly attributable to a signiÞ cant increase 
in energy and food prices. In addition, rapid 
growth in domestic demand in the majority 
of the countries contributed to underlying
inß ationary pressures. 
Energy prices increased in most non-euro area 
EU Member States. Food prices also increased 
signiÞ cantly, with the strongest increases 
observed in the Baltic States, Bulgaria and 
Hungary, generally reß ecting unfavourable 
weather conditions, food prices in the world 
markets and stronger global demand. Moreover, 
robust domestic demand continued to add to 
inß ationary pressures, especially in countries

2007with strong private consumption growth fuelled by strong credit growth on the back of negative 
real interest rates and substantial capital inß ows. Inß ationary pressures also resulted from strong 
wage growth in many countries, as labour 
market conditions tightened further. Nominal 
wage growth was particularly pronounced in 
the countries with higher output growth rates 
(i.e. the Baltic States, Bulgaria and Romania), 
where it exceeded productivity gains, 
triggering fast (in most cases double-digit) unit
labour cost growth. Import price trends 
differed signiÞ cantly across countries, partly 
reß ecting diverse exchange rate developments. 
In countries that allow for a signiÞ cant degree of exchange rate ß exibility, currency 
appreciation had a broadly dampening impact 
on import prices and, ultimately Œ given the 
countries™ relatively high degree of openness Œ 
headline inß ation. FISCAL POLICIESFiscal policies in the non-euro area EU Member 
States continued to be heterogeneous in 2007. 
Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia 
and Sweden recorded Þ scal surpluses, whereas 
the remaining countries registered Þ scal de
Þ cits (see Table 8). With the exception of Romania and 
the United Kingdom, budgetary outcomes for 
2007 were in line with, or better than, the budget 
balance targets of the updated convergence 
programmes submitted at the end of 2006 or the 
beginning of 2007. However, in many cases, 
this was due to the starting position at the end of 
2006 turning out to be better than foreseen in the 
programmes and buoyant tax revenues, which 
can be partly explained by higher GDP growth 
than initially expected. Progress in structural 
Þ scal consolidation seems to have stalled in 
most countries. Only Cyprus, Hungary, Poland 
and Sweden are estimated to have achieved a 
positive change in the cyclically adjusted budget 
balance of at least 0.5% of GDP between 2006 
and 2007 (net of one-off and other temporary measures). By contrast, the Þ scal stance in a 
number of countries was even loosened in a 
pro-cyclical way, despite strong output growth. At the end of 2007 the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia were subject to excessive 
deÞ cit procedures. According to the 2007-08 
updates of the convergence programmes, the 
deÞ cit ratio decreased in all of these countries in 
2007 except in the case of the Czech Republic. 
However, the Czech Ministry of Finance 
announced in January 2008 that the 2007 deÞ cit is estimated at only 1.9% of GDP, instead of 
the 3.4% of GDP stated in the convergence 
programme. Only in the case of Slovakia did the 
convergence programme point to a return of the 
deÞ cit ratio to below the reference value of 3% 
of GDP in 2007.With respect to the main decisions of the ECOFIN Council concerning the excessive 
deÞ cit procedure in 2007, Malta and the United 
Kingdom received abrogations in June and 
October respectively, after reporting a deÞ cit ratio below the 3% of GDP reference value 
for the Þ scal year 2006-07 and improvements 
in the structural balance. As regards Poland, in 
November 2007 the ECOFIN Council adopted 
a decision stating that the action taken by the 
Polish authorities was consistent with the 
Council recommendations made in February 
2007; nevertheless, the excessive deÞ cit procedure was not abrogated as the correction of 
the excessive deÞ cit was considered vulnerable 
to serious risks. The government debt ratio remained substantially below 60% of GDP in 2007 in 
most non-euro area EU Member States. Only 
in Malta and Hungary did the debt ratio remain 
above the 60% reference value, despite falling 
in 2007. In most of the other non-euro area 
EU Member States the debt ratio declined or 
remained broadly unchanged. 86ECBAnnual Report
2007BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
The combined current and capital account of the non-euro area EU Member States continued 
to vary considerably across countries in 2007 
(see Table 9), although the overall picture 
showed a deterioration in comparison with 
2006. While Denmark and Sweden reported 
surpluses, the remainder of the countries all 
recorded deÞ cits. Compared with 2006, these 
deÞ cits mostly increased, except in the case of 
Hungary, Malta and Slovakia. The deÞ cits in 
Bulgaria and Latvia were above 20% of GDP 
and exceeded 10% of GDP in Estonia, Lithuania 
and Romania. In Cyprus, Hungary, Slovakia and 
the United Kingdom, the deÞ cit stood between 
4% and 8% of GDP. The external imbalances 
in most countries originated from deÞ cits in 
goods, except in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Table 8 Fiscal positions in the non-euro area EU Member States and the euro area(as a percentage of GDP)General government surplus (+) / deÞ cit (-)

2007Poland and Slovakia, where the deÞ cits in 
income Œ often linked to the reinvested earnings of foreign-owned companies Œ were the most 
important factor.In many of the countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 and 1 January 2007, deÞ cits are, to a certain degree, a normal feature of 
the catching-up process, to the extent that they 
reß ect favourable investment opportunities 
and intertemporal consumption smoothing. 
However, very large current and capital account 
deÞ cits in some non-euro area EU Member 
States were also driven by cyclical factors 
and buoyant domestic demand, which signals 
risks to the sustainability of external positions, 
particularly if accompanied by deteriorating 
international price and cost competitiveness and 
a slowdown of export growth. In comparison with 2006, net direct investment in 
2007 decreased substantially in Denmark, Sweden 

and the United Kingdom. It remained rather 

stable for the EU11 aggregate, although a marked 

decline was recorded in Hungary, Slovakia and 
Malta. Especially for the latter country, the 

signiÞ cant drop might be seen as a normalisation 
following the high levels recorded in 2006. While 

net direct investment continued to constitute an 

important source of Þ nancing in a number of 
non-euro area EU Member States, in the case 

of the Baltic States, Hungary, Romania and the 

United Kingdom the deÞ cit in the basic balance, 
i.e. the sum of the combined current account 

and capital account balance and net direct 

investment, was higher than 4% of GDP, and 

for Latvia it exceeded 15% of GDP. As regards 

net portfolio inß ows, the balance remained 
negative or broadly neutral in all non-euro area 

EU Member States, with the exceptions of 

Denmark and Hungary. In these two countries, 

net portfolio investment inß ows resulted from 
substantial net debt inß ows related, in the case 
of Hungary, to yield differentials, whereas
net equity ß ows were negative. Net ﬁother 
investmentﬂ ß ows were largely positive in most 
countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 

and 1 January 2007, reß ecting mainly loans 
from foreign-owned parent banks to their 

subsidiaries in the region.

2007EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTSExchange rate developments in the non-euro 
area EU Member States in 2007 mainly reß ected 
the exchange rate regimes of the individual 

countries. The currencies of Denmark, Estonia, 

Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovakia 

participated in ERM II. They maintained a 

standard ß uctuation band of ±15% around their 
central rates against the euro, except the Danish 

krone, with a narrower band of ±2.25%. ERM II 

participation is, in some cases, also accompanied 

by unilateral commitments on the part of the 

countries concerned to maintain narrower 

ß uctuation bands. These unilateral commitments 
placed no additional obligations on the ECB. In 

particular, it was agreed that the Estonian kroon 

and the Lithuanian litas could join ERM II with 

their existing currency board arrangements 

in place. The Maltese authorities stated their 

intention to maintain the exchange rate of the 

Maltese lira at its central rate against the euro 

and the Latvian authorities decided that they 

would maintain the exchange rate of the lats at 

the central rate against the euro with a ß uctuation 
band of ±1%. The agreements on participation 

for the countries whose currencies joined ERM II 

after 2004 (i.e. all the countries listed above 

except Denmark) are all based on a number of 

policy commitments by the respective authorities, 

relating, inter alia, to the pursuit of sound Þ scal 
policies, the promotion of wage moderation and 

wage developments in line with productivity 

growth, the containment of credit growth and the 

implementation of further structural reforms. 
The Danish krone, the Estonian kroon, the 
Cyprus pound, the Lithuanian litas and the 
Maltese lira were stable against the euro in 2007 
and traded continuously at, or very close to, 
their central rates. Moreover, the Cyprus pound 
and the Maltese lira were converted irrevocably 
to the euro following euro area enlargement on 
1 January 2008. The Slovak koruna, by contrast, experienced a relatively high degree of volatility
(see Table 10). Against the background of 
improving macroeconomic fundamentals 
and a favourable economic outlook, in 
mid-2006 the koruna entered a period of 
protracted appreciation, which gained 
further momentum during February and 
the Þ rst half of March 2007. To contain
exchange rate volatility and excessive market 
pressures, in early March 2007 Národná banka 
Slovenska intervened to weaken the currency. 
On 19 March 2007, at the request of the Slovak 
authorities, by mutual agreement and following 
a common procedure, the central rate of the 
Slovak koruna was revalued by 8.5% vis-à-vis 
the euro. Owing to a more moderate inß ation outlook, Národná banka Slovenska lowered 
its policy rate by a total of 50 basis points 
in late March and late April 2007 to 4.25%, 
which helped to stabilise the koruna vis-à-vis 
the euro. Since April 2007 the Slovak koruna 
has remained relatively stable, ß uctuating at values between 5% and 8% stronger than 
the new central parity. The Latvian lats also Table 10 Developments in ERM IIMaximum deviation in % Currency Entry date Upper rate Central rate Lower rate  UpwardDownward

89ECBAnnual Report
2007experienced higher volatility than in previous years, although the ß uctuations remained within 
the unilateral narrow band of ±1% around 
its central rate. Having traded around 1% 
stronger than its ERM II central rate for most 
of 2006, the lats moved towards the weaker 
side of its unilateral narrow ß uctuation band 
on two occasions (in mid-February 2007 and 
in September 2007). The Þ rst episode followed 
Standard & Poor™s downgrading Œ from stable 
to negative Œ of Latvia™s future outlook on 
19 February 2007 and rumours of a potential 
devaluation of the Latvian currency™s ERM II 
central rate. In mid-March 2007 Latvijas Banka 
stepped in to prevent further weakness of the 
lats by intervening in foreign exchange markets 
and by increasing the reÞ nancing rate, from 
5.0% to 5.5%, as of the end of March 2007 
and again, to 6.0%, almost two months later. 
One-month interbank deposit rates increased 
signiÞ cantly, ß uctuating approximately between 
100 and 400 basis points above the reÞ nancing rate. In April 2007 the tensions in the foreign 
exchange markets gradually subsided amid the 
government™s commitment to implement an 
anti-inß ation plan, but the one-month interest 
rate remained considerably above the ECB™s 
minimum bid rate. On 12 May 2007 the lats again 
reached the stronger side of its ±1% ß uctuation band and the central bank intervened to prevent 
further appreciation. In September 2007 the 
lats once more came under pressure, following 
a downgrade by Moody™s and concerns over 
further increases in the current account deÞ cit and inß ation. Latvijas Banka did not intervene 
on this occasion, but money market conditions 
nonetheless remained tight.Turning to the currencies of the non-euro area 
EU Member States that were not participating in 

ERM II, developments varied considerably across 

countries (see Chart 38). The Czech koruna and 

the Polish zloty appreciated against the euro 

throughout most of 2007, standing, respectively, 

8.3% and 7.8% stronger vis-à-vis the euro on
29 February 2008 than at the beginning of 2007. 

After a period of relative stability in the Þ rst three 
quarters of 2007, the pound sterling weakened 

considerably against the euro owing to increased 

economic uncertainty that may be partly 

attributed to less favourable economic growth 

prospects linked also to a weaker housing market. 

As a result, on 29 February 2008 the pound stood 

13.6% below its 2 January 2007 level against 

the euro. Owing to both domestic factors and 

the broad strength of the euro, the Romanian leu 

and the Swedish krona also recorded a period 

of weakness vis-à-vis the euro, declining by 

10.3% and 4.1% respectively in the period under 

review. Notwithstanding some ß uctuations, the 
Hungarian forint remained broadly unchanged 

in 2007, depreciating somewhat at the beginning 

of 2008. On 25 February 2008 the Magyar 

Nemzeti Bank, in agreement with the Hungarian 

government, decided to abolish the ß uctuation 
bands around the forint and introduced a free 

ß oat. Finally, the Bulgarian lev remained stable 
at BGN/EUR 1.95583, reß ecting the unchanged 
Bulgarian exchange rate policy under the euro-
based currency board arrangement.FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSBetween January 2007 and February 2008, the 
evolution of long-term government bond yields 
in most of the non-euro area EU Member 
States10 was similar to that in the euro area, with an increase in the Þ rst part of the year followed 
by a decrease from August 2007 onwards amid 
global turmoil in Þ nancial markets.
In February 2008 long-term interest rates in 

the non-euro area EU Member States were, on

beginning of last year. Long-term interest rate 
differentials remained comparatively large in 
Romania and Hungary, where they stood at 
around 340 and 280 basis points respectively. 
In these countries, Þ scal developments and 
external imbalances contributed to keeping 
long-term bond differentials high. Additionally, 
for Romania this evolution is due to higher 
inß ation rates during the last years.
Overall, between January 2007 and 
February 2008, stock markets in most non-
euro area EU Member States recorded positive 
growth. Stock prices rose most in Bulgaria, 
Cyprus and Romania, clearly outperforming 
the average stock price developments in the 
euro area as measured by the Dow Jones 
EURO STOXX index. In Estonia and Latvia, 
however, stock prices had declined by the end of 
February 2008 to the average levels prevailing 
in 2006, after reaching historical peaks during 
2007. Stock exchange indices in most non-
euro area EU Member States declined in the 
wake of  the turmoil in global Þ nancial markets 
during the summer months, as some investors 
withdrew their assets from stock markets in 
order to improve their overall liquidity. The 
negative sentiment in stock exchanges improved 
somewhat during September and October 2007. 
Later, however, equity markets in most of the 
EU14 countries declined again owing to a lower 
global risk appetite, in line with stock markets 
in the euro area and other major economies.In 2007 growth in credit to the private sector 

remained high in all non-euro area EU Member 

States. Towards the end of 2007 annual credit 

growth appeared to stabilise in many countries, 

partly reß ecting the rise in bank interest rates. 
However, it continued to accelerate in some 

countries, such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, 

Lithuania and Poland. Credit growth was the 

most dynamic in the fast-growing Baltic States, 

Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, with the growth 

rates standing between 32% and 62% at the end 

of 2007. In the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary 

and Slovakia, the annual growth rate of credit to 

the private sector was between 19% and 29% in 

2007. Rapid credit expansion in these economies, 

with the exception of Cyprus, needs to be seen 

in the context of Þ nancial deepening. Indeed, the 
ratios of credit to the private sector to GDP in all 

EU11 countries, with the exceptions of Cyprus 

and Malta, remain well below the euro area 

average. Nevertheless, rapid credit expansion also 

poses a risk as it contributes in some countries to 

strong domestic demand and thereby to excessive 

external and internal imbalances. In addition, 

the large, rising share of foreign currency-
denominated borrowing is of particular concern 

in a number of countries. In Denmark, Sweden

2007stability. Monetary policy strategies, however, differ considerably from country to country 
(see Table 11). In 2007 the monetary policy and exchange rate regimes of the non-euro area EU Member 
States remained largely unchanged, although 
some reÞ nements were made to monetary 
policy frameworks in a few countries with a 
view to future monetary integration. However, 
in February 2008 Hungary abolished its 
exchange rate peg to the euro and moved to a 
fully-ß edged in
ß ation target with a free-
ß oating exchange rate.With regard to monetary policy decisions between January 2007 and February 2008, most 
central banks participating in ERM II adopted 
measures to tighten monetary policy conditions. 
These often mirrored moves by the ECB, which 
in 2007 raised the minimum bid rate on the main 
reÞ nancing operations of the Eurosystem by a 
total of 50 basis points, in two steps (in March 
and June), to 4.0%.    (Bulgarian National Bank), Eesti Pank and Lietuvos bankas have no ofÞ cial policy rates given their currency board 
arrangements; they automatically adjust to 
the rates set by the ECB. However, in view of 
strong inß ation, several NCBs took additional 
measures.    (Bulgarian National Bank) abolished, as of January 2007, 
the requirement for additional reserves for banks 
exceeding certain credit growth ceilings. At the 
same time, to cushion strong credit growth, it 
decided to raise the minimum reserve requirement 
by 400 basis points to 12%. Confronted with 
increasing volatility of the nominal exchange 
rate of the Latvian lats, persistently very high 
inß ation and overheating domestic demand, 
Latvijas Banka increased its reÞ nancing rate 
by a total of 100 basis points to 6.0% as well as 
the marginal lending facility rate by a total of
150 basis points to 7.5% in the Þ rst Þ ve months of 2007 and intervened in the foreign exchange 
market on several occasions. Despite the rise 
in policy interest rates, short-term real interest 
rates (in the four above-mentioned countries) remain negative, against the background of fast 
real GDP growth, rising inß ationary pressures 
and large persistent external imbalances.Following the ECB™s moves, Danmarks Nationalbank increased its lending rate in two 
steps to 4.25%. On 12 March and 6 June 2007 the 
Central Bank of Cyprus increased its marginal 
lending and overnight deposit facility rates by 
25 basis points each time to 5.00% and 3.00% 
respectively, in a move to gradually establish a 
1 percentage point margin between the two rates 
and the Cypriot main reÞ nancing rate, which 
remained at 4.5%. In December 2007 the main 
reÞ nancing rate was reduced by 50 basis points 
and thereby became realigned with that of the 
euro area at 4%. The Central Bank of Malta 
raised its central intervention rate twice by 
25 basis points on 25 January and 29 May 2007, 
to 4.25%. The decisions were taken against 
the background of a further decline in external 
reserves and a marked narrowing of the short-
term interest rate differential vis-à-vis the euro 
in favour of the Maltese lira, mainly as a result 
of the increase in interest rates in the euro area. 
In December 2007 the main policy rate was 
reduced by 25 basis points, thereby realigning 
itself with that of the euro area. The last interest 
rate decisions by the central banks of Cyprus 
and Malta were part of their Þ nal preparations 
before joining the euro area on 1 January 2008. 
Národná banka Slovenska lowered its repo 
rate by a total of 50 basis points to 4.25% on 
25 April 2007 (and widened the corridor of 
overnight rates around that rate), based on a 
more moderate inß ation outlook. 
The monetary policy decisions of those NCBs 
with inß ation targets that are not participating 
in ERM II differed across countries, mainly 
reß ecting their different cyclical positions 
and inß ationary outlook. In view of rising 
inß ationary pressures and an upward revision of 
its inß ation forecast for 2007 and 2008, 
eská národní banka increased its main reÞ nancing rate four times in 2007 Œ by a total of 100 basis 
points Œ to 3.5%. Narodowy Bank Polski raised 
its main policy rate in four steps Œ by a total 
of 100 basis points Œ to 5%. In January and 93ECBAnnual Report
2007February 2008 the main policy rate was raised again by a total of 50 basis points to 5.5%. A 
tightening was felt necessary given that inß ation is likely to exceed the inß ation target owing to 
real GDP growing above potential, high wage 
and unit labour cost growth and a loosening of 
Þ scal policy. Sveriges Riksbank increased its 
main policy rate in Þ ve steps by a total of 125 
basis points to 4.25% in February 2008 in order 
to bring the inß ation forecast back to the target 
level of 2%. In 2007 the Bank of England increased its main policy rate on three occasions Œ by a total of 
75 basis points Œ to 5.75%, mainly against the 
background of Þ rm growth and high in
ß ation. However, the Bank of England subsequently 
lowered it by 50 basis points to 5.25%. The 
latest decisions were made amid signs of weaker 
growth momentum.In contrast to most other countries, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank decreased its key interest rate 
in two steps Œ by 50 basis points altogether Œ 
to 7.5%, as the medium-term inß ation target 
seemed to be attainable. In 2007 Banca 
Naional a României cut its key interest rate in four steps Œ by a total of 175 basis points Œ 
to 7.0% by June 2007, in view of an improving 
inß ationary outlook and a stronger than 
expected appreciation of the nominal exchange 
rate. However, in October 2007 and January and 
February 2008, the policy rate was increased by 
a total of 200 basis points to 9.0% on the back 
of the deteriorating inß ation outlook owing to 
both supply and demand shocks.CENTRAL BANK 
OPERATIONS 
AND ACTIVITIESCHAPTER 296ECBAnnual Report
20071.1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS
The monetary policy operations of the 
Eurosystem comprise on the one hand open 

market operations, such as main reÞ nancing 
operations (MROs), longer-term reÞ nancing 
operations (LTROs) and Þ ne-tuning operations, 
and on the other hand standing facilities. Within 

the operational framework for the implementation 

of monetary policy, which also includes the 

system of minimum reserve requirements, 

these instruments are used to manage liquidity 

conditions in the interbank money market, Þ rst of 
all with a view to steering very short-term interest 

rates Œ in particular the overnight money market 

rate Œ close to the minimum bid rate in the MROs, 

which is the Eurosystem™s key policy rate.On two occasions in 2007, namely on 8 March 
and 6 June, the Governing Council increased the 

minimum bid rate by 25 basis points, to 3.75% 

and 4.00% respectively. As on previous occasions 

since the amendment of the operational framework 

in March 2004, these interest rate changes did not 

inß uence liquidity conditions or the overnight 
money market rate in a noticeable way before 

they actually entered into effect, illustrating that 

the amended framework has signiÞ cantly helped 
in shielding very short-term money market 

interest rates from the impact of expectations 

about changes in the monetary policy stance. 

However, after 9 August 2007 the Eurosystem 

faced one of the most challenging periods for 

the implementation of monetary policy since 

the introduction of the euro, when the turmoil 

in Þ nancial markets originating from the US 
sub-prime mortgage market spilled over into the 

euro money market. Within hours of the liquidity 

drying up in the euro money market on the 

morning of 9 August, the Eurosystem reacted by 

providing •95 billion of additional liquidity to the 

market at its policy rate of 4.00% in a Þ ne-tuning 
operation with overnight maturity. This was the 

largest volume that had ever been allotted in a 

Þ ne-tuning operation up until that point. Thereafter, 
the Eurosystem™s open market operations 

continued to be heavily inß uenced by the turmoil 
until the end of 2007. Box 9 describes the speciÞ c operational measures which the Eurosystem used 
to address the tensions in the money market and 

highlights the role of the collateral framework in 

supporting monetary policy implementation in this 

period of Þ nancial market volatility.
A particularly important indicator for assessing 

how successful the ECB was in steering very 

short-term interest rates is the spread between 

the overnight money market rate, as measured by 

the EONIA (euro overnight index average), an 

important reference rate for the money market, and 

the minimum bid rate in the MROs (see Chart 40). 

In 2007 this EONIA spread stood on average 

at 3 basis points, lower than the 8 basis points 

observed in 2006. At the same time, the volatility 

of the EONIA spread, as measured by the standard 

deviation, increased to 12 basis points in 2007, 

from 5 basis points in the previous year. These 

developments mainly reß ect the more volatile 
market environment as of 9 August: even though 

the ECB was indeed able to steer the average 

overnight rate fairly close to the minimum bid rate 

throughout the year, this was accompanied by an 

increase in the standard deviation of the EONIA 

spread from 6 basis points before 9 August to 

17 basis points as of 9 August. Over the same 

period, the average level of the spread decreased 

from 6 basis points to -3 basis points.LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE BANKING SYSTEM

2007account a daily assessment of the liquidity needs of the aggregate euro area banking 
system. These liquidity needs are determined 
by the sum of minimum reserve requirements, 
funds held in excess of these requirements on 
credit institutions™ current accounts with the 
Eurosystem (excess reserves) and autonomous 
factors. Autonomous factors are those items 
on the Eurosystem™s balance sheet, such as 
ﬁbanknotes in circulationﬂ and ﬁgovernment 
depositsﬂ, which have an impact on credit 
institutions™ current account holdings but are 
not under the direct control of the Eurosystem™s 
liquidity management. In 2007 the average daily liquidity needs of the euro area banking system (see Chart 41) 
amounted to •441.5 billion, 5% higher than 
in 2006. The main reason for the increase 
was the continued growth in average reserve 
requirements, by 14%, to •187.4 billion, 
which was only partially offset by a decrease 
in autonomous factors of 2% to •252.2 billion. 
Among the autonomous factors, banknotes 
in circulation rose signiÞ cantly, although the 
growth rate decreased to 9%, from 11% in 2006. 
The liquidity-draining impact of the growth in 
banknotes was, however, more than offset by 
other autonomous factors. Although average 
excess reserves for the maintenance periods ending in 2007 increased by •0.2 billion to 
•0.9 billion, they remained negligible in relative 
terms at 0.5% of reserve requirements. MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEMCredit institutions in the euro area are required 
to hold minimum reserves on current accounts 
with the Eurosystem. As has been the case 
since 1999, the minimum reserve requirements 
amounted to 2% of credit institutions™ 
reserve base in 2007. It is the growth in the 
reserve base, which is determined by certain 
short-term liabilities on credit institutions™ 
balance sheets, which explains the above-
mentioned 14% increase in the total amount of 
reserve requirements during 2007. Since for any 
maintenance period the Eurosystem remunerates 
the reserve holdings at a rate which is the average 
of the marginal rate of the MROs, the minimum 
reserve system does not impose noticeable 
costs on the banking sector. At the same time, it 
fulÞ ls two important functions in the operational 
framework for monetary policy implementation: 
Þ rst, it stabilises short-term money market rates, 
because the reserve requirements have to be 
fulÞ lled only on average over the maintenance 
period, allowing credit institutions to smooth out 
temporary and unexpected liquidity inß ows and outß ows on their accounts; second, it enlarges 
the liquidity deÞ cit of the banking system, 
i.e. banks™ overall need for reÞ nancing from the 
Eurosystem. OPEN MARKET OPERATIONSThe Eurosystem uses MROs, LTROs and 

Þ ne-tuning operations to manage the liquidity 
situation in the money market. All 

liquidity-providing operations have to be fully 

collateralised. MROs are regular operations with 

a weekly frequency and normally have a maturity 

of one week. They are the main instrument for 

managing the liquidity situation in the market and 

signalling the monetary policy stance. In 2007 

they were conducted as variable rate tenders with 

a minimum bid rate, which is the key monetary 

policy rate of the ECB. While a wide range of 

counterparties (1,693 at the end of 2007) are 

eligible for these operations, 338 actually 

participated on average in 2007, 10% less than in

20072006 (377). Up until 8 August the ECB on 
average allotted •292 billion in the MROs. The 

ECB provided •1 billion more liquidity than the 

benchmark allotment, which is the amount that 

allows counterparties to fulÞ l their reserve 
requirements smoothly until the settlement of the 

next MRO, 1 on all but one occasion (when 
•2 billion more than the benchmark amount was 

allotted). The ECB thereby continued a policy 

which had started in October 2005 of providing 

liquidity slightly above the benchmark to counter 

apparent upward pressure on the EONIA spread. 

After 9 August the average allotment dropped to 

•200 billion, reß ecting the provision of additional 
liquidity in supplementary LTROs (see below 

and Box 9).LTROs are monthly liquidity-providing operations with a three-month maturity. They 
are conducted as pure variable rate tenders (with no limits on bid rates) with a pre-announced 
allotment volume, which was set at •50 billion 
at the beginning of 2007. LTROs are open to 
the same set of counterparties as MROs, 145 
of which on average participated in LTROs 
in 2007, compared with 162 in 2006. After 
9 August 2007 two supplementary LTROs (with 
settlement on 24 August and 13 September) 
were conducted and later rolled over with an 
adjustment to the overall amount. At the end of 
2007 the outstanding amount of LTROs stood at 
•268 billion, almost 80% higher than the amount 
outstanding at the beginning of August. The benchmark allotment allows counterparties, in the 1 aggregate, to maintain current accounts close to their reserve requirements, taking into account foreseen liquidity needs and 
liquidity imbalances that have already accumulated in the same 
maintenance period. For an exact deÞ nition of the benchmark, 
see the box entitled ﬁPublication of the benchmark allotment in 
the main reÞ nancing operationsﬂ in the April 2004 issue of the 
ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.Box 9 
MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS DURING THE FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY
Providing liquidity earlier in the reserve maintenance periodIn its open market operations the Eurosystem usually provides liquidity in a way that enables credit institutions to maintain current accounts with the Eurosystem which are close to their 
reserve requirements, thereby fulÞ lling these requirements proportionally over the maintenance period. This is achieved by allotting amounts in the main reÞ nancing operations (MROs) 
which are close to the benchmark amount. The purpose of this allotment policy is to maintain 
very short-term rates close to the main ofÞ cial rate, namely the minimum bid rate in the 
Eurosystem™s MROs. However, after the turmoil in Þ nancial markets had spilled over into 
the overnight euro money market on the morning of 9 August 2007, it appeared that credit 
institutions developed a preference for fulÞ lling their reserve requirements relatively early in 
the maintenance period against the background of indications of decreasing turnover in longer-
term money market segments.In order to achieve its target for very short-term interest rates, the ECB ﬁfrontloadedﬂ the supply of 
reserves, i.e. it increased the supply of liquidity towards the beginning of the maintenance period, while 

reducing the provision at the end of the period.1 This frontloading of reserves in the Þ rst few days after 
9 August was achieved by injecting additional liquidity in four overnight Þ ne-tuning operations. A 
Þ fth 
overnight Þ ne-tuning operation was conducted at the beginning of September. Thereafter, the additional 
1 The Eurosystem had frontloaded the supply of reserves by providing liquidity slightly above the benchmark allotment in the MR
Os already before the turmoil. However, the degree of frontloading was much higher during the period of turmoil, as the chart illustrates.
99ECBAnnual Report
2007liquidity at the beginning of the maintenance 
period was mainly provided in the regular MROs. 

In all cases, the liquidity provision for the whole 

maintenance period remained unchanged, only 

the timing of the provision was adapted. This is 

illustrated by the path of the daily reserve surplus, 

i.e. the difference between current account holdings 

of credit institutions and reserve requirements in 

the course of a maintenance period (see the chart). 

While the daily reserve surplus was on average 

relatively close to zero in the maintenance periods 

before August 2007, it was well above zero at the 

beginning of subsequent maintenance periods and 

well below zero towards the end of those periods. 
On 8 October and 23 November the ECB announced 2 (via news wire services) that it would reinforce this policy of ﬁfrontloadingﬂ 
and that it would steer liquidity towards 
more balanced conditions also during the 
period if this was needed to keep short-term rates close to the minimum bid rate. In line with 
this communication, the ECB steadily allotted amounts signiÞ cantly above the benchmark in 
the MROs, and whenever notable downward pressure on the overnight rate started to appear, 
the ECB conducted liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations. In addition to the usual 
Þ ne-tuning operations on the last day of the maintenance period, such liquidity-absorbing 
Þ ne-tuning operations were carried out on 12 October, 7 December, 17 December and, as 
described below, around the year-end. On 14 January 2008 the ECB conÞ rmed that it would 
continue its frontloading policy for as long as necessary.Supplementary longer-term reÞ nancing operationsThe Þ nancial market volatility seemed to increase banks™ preference for reducing their 
future liquidity needs, which led to signiÞ cant tensions in the money market, not only in the 
short-term segment but also in the longer-term segment, where the turnover was reported to be 
very low. In order to support a normalisation of conditions, the Eurosystem increased the share of 
reÞ nancing provided via three-month longer-term re
Þ nancing operations (LTROs), while at the 
same time reducing the share provided via the one-week MROs. Accordingly, the total amount 
of outstanding reÞ nancing remained unchanged, while the average maturity was extended, 
thereby temporarily reducing the future liquidity needs of the banking system. SpeciÞ cally, two supplementary LTROs with a maturity of three months were carried out, one on 23 August and 
one on 12 September, for amounts of •40 billion and •75 billion respectively. As the regular 
monthly LTROs were conducted as usual, the total amount of reÞ nancing provided via LTROs 
increased from •150 billion (three allotments of •50 billion) to •265 billion, while the size of 
the MROs decreased correspondingly from around •300 billion to below •200 billion. The 
supplementary LTROs were renewed when they matured in November and December, with an 2 The full list of statements issued by the ECB can be found at: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omo/html/communication

Banks are usually more reluctant to lend in the money market in the last weeks of the year, owing 
to balance sheet concerns. This well-known phenomenon was foreseen to be particularly strong in 2007. In a press release on 30 November, the ECB therefore announced special measures 

to alleviate tensions in the money market during this time period. The maturity of the MRO 

allotted on 18 December was exceptionally extended from one to two weeks, so that banks could 

cover their liquidity needs over Christmas and the days around the year-end in advance of this 

difÞ cult period. On 17 December the ECB also communicated via news wire services that in this 
two-week MRO it would deviate from the usual allotment procedure and satisfy all bids at or 

above the weighted average rate of the previous MRO, which was 4.21%. This decision was mainly 

driven by evidence suggesting that liquidity needs could push up bidding rates to undesirable levels. 

As a result, the ECB allotted •348.6 billion, which was •168.1 billion more than the benchmark 

amount. The provision of such abundant liquidity resulted in downward pressure on the overnight 

rate. In order to reduce this pressure, the ECB conducted a series of liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning 
operations. The last of these Þ ne-tuning operations was conducted on 3 January, the day before 
the settlement of the Þ rst MRO in 2008. On average, the ECB drained •143.8 billion per day via 
Þ ne-tuning operations. However, the ECB also provided •20 billion of additional liquidity at a 
marginal tender rate of 4.20% in the MRO covering the year-end, thereby accommodating further 

liquidity demands from counterparties over this period. As a result of the very ample supply of 

liquidity, the EONIA stood 8 basis points below the minimum bid rate on the last trading day 

of 2007, whereas it had been 19 and 17 basis points above the minimum bid rate in the previous 

two years.Operations in connection with the US dollar Term Auction Facility As euro area banks were reported to be particularly concerned about the availability of their funding 
denominated in US dollars, the ECB established a reciprocal currency arrangement (swap line) in connection with the US dollar Term Auction Facility of the Federal Reserve System. The Eurosystem 

provided the US dollar funding received via this swap line to its counterparties against collateral 

eligible for Eurosystem credit operations in two operations settling on 20 and 27 December. Similar 

operations were also carried out by the Swiss National Bank. In each of the Eurosystem™s operations, 

US dollar funding of USD 10 billion was provided to counterparties with access to the marginal 

lending facility for a maturity of approximately one month. The two operations were conducted 

at a Þ xed rate equal to the marginal rate of the simultaneous Federal Reserve tenders, 4.65% and 
4.67% respectively, and attracted bids of USD 22 billion on 17 December and USD 14 billion on 

20 December. These operations did not have a direct effect on euro liquidity conditions, but aimed 

to improve global funding conditions. The operations were renewed in January 2008, but liquidity 

needs in US dollars had declined, as highlighted by the decreasing volume of bids. The ECB did 

not carry out any US dollar funding operations in February.The collateral framework in the period of Þ nancial market volatilityOwing to its acceptance of a broad range of collateral, the Eurosystem™s collateral framework has 
been well equipped to support the implementation of monetary policy during the ongoing market 101ECBAnnual Report
2007The ECB executes liquidity-providing and liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations on 
an ad hoc basis to manage liquidity conditions 
in the market and to steer interest rates. The 
Eurosystem has selected a limited number of 
counterparties most active in the money market 
for these operations (127 at the end of 2007). 
In 2007 the ECB conducted 24 Þ ne-tuning operations, 18 of which were launched after 
9 August as a result of the Þ nancial market 
turmoil. This compares with 31 Þ ne-tuning operations conducted in the eight-year period 
from 1999 until 2006. All six operations 
conducted before 9 August were executed 
in order to re-establish balanced liquidity 
conditions on the last day of the maintenance 
period, as has been the practice since November 
2004. Four were liquidity-absorbing and two 
liquidity-providing operations, reß ecting the 
slightly higher probability of a liquidity surplus 
after an allotment above the benchmark amount 
in the last MRO of the maintenance period. 
On two occasions, the intended amount 
could not be reached in a liquidity-absorbing 
operation, owing to an insufÞ cient volume 
of bids. The practice of conducting end-of-
period Þ ne-tuning operations was maintained 
after 9 August. However, most Þ ne-tuning operations thereafter (a total of 14) were used 
to counter ß uctuations in liquidity conditions 
and the overnight rate related to the Þ nancial market turmoil within the maintenance period 
(see Box 9).STANDING FACILITIESCounterparties may use the two standing 
facilities on their own initiative to obtain 
overnight liquidity against eligible collateral or 
to make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. 
At the end of 2007, 2,122 counterparties had 
access to the marginal lending facility and 
2,798 counterparties had access to the deposit 
facility. The rates for these facilities, at 100 basis points above and below the minimum bid rate 
on the MROs respectively, provide in principle 
a ceiling and a ß oor for the overnight rate and 
therefore perform an important function for 
monetary policy implementation. In 2007 the 
marginal lending facility was used to the average 
amount of •0.2 billion and the deposit facility 
to •0.5 billion per day, which represented an 
increase of •0.1 and •0.3 billion respectively by 
comparison with the previous year. The increase 
in the average recourse to the deposit facility 
can be attributed to the developments after 
9  August.ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR MONETARY POLICY 

OPERATIONS 
In line with central bank practice worldwide, 
all credit operations of the Eurosystem need 
to be based on adequate collateral. The 
concept of adequacy implies, Þ rst, that the 
Eurosystem is protected from incurring losses 
in its credit operations and, second, that 
sufÞ cient collateral should be available to a wide

As Charts 42 and 43 demonstrate, sufÞ ciency of collateral has not been a constraint for the Eurosystem, even at the peak of outstanding credit during the turmoil. Against this background, the collateral framework has facilitated access for a broad range of counterparties to 
central bank money. 102ECBAnnual Report
2007set of counterparties, so that the Eurosystem can provide the amount of liquidity it 
deems necessary through both its monetary 
policy and payment systems operations. To 
facilitate this, the Eurosystem accepts a broad 
range of assets as collateral. This proved 
to be a stabilising feature in the ongoing 
Þ nancial market turmoil, since it ensured that 
counterparties had enough collateral at their 
disposal to access the credit operations of the 
Eurosystem.In 2007 the average amount of eligible 
collateral increased by 7.7% compared with 

2006, to a total of •9.5 trillion (see Chart 42). 

General government debt, at •4.7 trillion, 

accounted for 49% of the total, with the 

remainder of marketable collateral taking the 

form of credit institution uncovered bonds 

(•1.6 trillion, or 17%), credit institution 

covered bonds (•1.2 trillion, or 12%), 

corporate bonds (•0.8 trillion, or 9%), asset-
backed securities (•0.7 trillion, or 8%), 

and other bonds, such as those issued by 

supranational organisations, (•0.4 trillion, or 4%). In addition, non-marketable assets, 
consisting in particular of credit claims (also 

referred to as bank loans), have been included 

in the single list of eligible assets since 

1 January 2007. However, as the eligibility 

of these assets is not assessed in advance of 

their acceptance, the potential volume of such 

assets cannot easily be measured. Their use in 

2007 reached •0.1 trillion, representing 1% of 

total eligible collateral in the Eurosystem. 
The average value of marketable and 
non-marketable assets deposited by counterparties 

as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations 

rose signiÞ cantly from •906 billion on average 
in 2006 to •1,101 billion in 2007. This increase 

was mainly due to the fact that counterparties 

deposited large additional amounts of collateral 

with the Eurosystem after the outbreak of the 

Þ nancial turmoil in August (see Chart 43). As the 
comparison of collateral with outstanding credit 

to the Eurosystem™s counterparties indicates, the 

share of deposited collateral not used to cover credit 

from monetary policy operations continued to be 
high. This suggests that sufÞ ciency of collateral 
has not been a constraint on the Eurosystem™s counterparties in the wake of the turmoil.As regards the asset types deposited as collateral with the Eurosystem, the annual average share 
of central government bonds dropped from 23% 
in 2006 to 15% in 2007. Uncovered bank bonds 
continued to form the largest class of assets 
deposited with the Eurosystem (33% on average 
in 2007). The average share of asset-backed 
securities increased from 12% in 2006 to 16% 
in 2007.Following the euro area-wide introduction 
on 1 January 2007 of non-marketable assets 

as eligible collateral in Eurosystem credit 

operations, counterparties have started 

to make use of this additional collateral 

source. On a yearly average this asset class 

represented 10% of the overall amount of 

collateral deposited, compared with 4% in 

2006 (see Chart 44). The number of credit 

claims whose creditworthiness could be 

assessed remained limited in 2007 (see the 

section on risk management issues). The full 

potential of this additional collateral source 

has therefore not yet been reaped.Chart 43 Collateral put forward in Eurosystem

2007On 24 May 2007 the Governing Council adopted the following two minor adjustments to 
the collateral framework during 2007:The calendar for the phasing-out of  Œ
marketable tier two assets eligible as 
collateral for Eurosystem credit operations 
was amended.2The residence criteria for assets eligible as  Œ
collateral for Eurosystem credit operations 
were further deÞ ned.3 RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESThe Eurosystem mitigates the risk of a 
counterparty default in a Eurosystem credit 
operation by requiring counterparties to submit 
adequate collateral. However, despite this 
requirement, the Eurosystem may still be exposed 
to a number of Þ nancial risks if a counterparty 
defaults. These include the credit risk associated 
with the collateral accepted, and the market and 
liquidity risks of adverse movements in the price 
of the collateral during the liquidation period 
after a counterparty default. In order to reduce 
these risks to acceptable levels, the Eurosystem 
maintains high credit standards for assets 
accepted as collateral, valuates collateral on a daily basis and applies appropriate risk control 
measures. Financial risks in credit operations 
are quantiÞ ed and reported to the ECB™s 
decision-making bodies.To ensure that its high credit standards for collateral are met, the Eurosystem relies on a 
set of procedures, rules and techniques that 
together constitute the Eurosystem credit 
assessment framework (ECAF). The credit 
quality threshold for the collateral eligible for 
Eurosystem credit operations is deÞ ned within 
the ECAF in terms of a ﬁsingle Aﬂ credit 
assessment.4 The ECAF foresees a number of alternative credit assessment sources. The 
euro area-wide introduction of non-marketable 
assets as eligible collateral in Eurosystem 
credit operations as of 1 January 2007 was 
combined with the Þ rst, but still limited, use of 
internal ratings-based systems by Eurosystem 
counterparties as a new source of credit 
assessment. As a consequence of the limited 
use of internal ratings-based systems, most of 
the credit claims that were newly eligible as of 
1 January 2007 and were submitted thereafter 
to the Eurosystem were claims on public sector 
entities for which an implicit credit assessment 
is derived from the credit assessment of the 
country where the debtor or guarantor of the 
credit claim is established.A number of additions related to the ECAF were introduced in 2007. Following a decision 
by the Governing Council on 19 October 2007, Marketable assets which were issued prior to 31 May 2007 and 2 are traded on non-regulated markets that currently fulÞ l the 
Eurosystem™s requirements for safety and accessibility, but not for transparency, will remain eligible until 31 December 2009 
and will become ineligible thereafter.
As a result of the completion of the single collateral framework 
3 on 1 January 2007, the Eurosystem has speciÞ ed that, with the 
exception of international or supranational institutions, issuers 

of marketable assets eligible for Eurosystem credit operations 

must be established either in the EEA or in one of the four 

non-EEA G10 countries (Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the United 

States). Assets issued after 1 January 2007 by entities domiciled 

outside the EEA or the non-EEA G10 countries are not eligible, 

irrespective of whether a guarantee by an entity established in the 

EEA is available. However, assets issued before 1 January 2007 

will remain eligible until 31 December 2011 and will only become 

ineligible after that date.

2007the rating agency DBRS is used, as of 1 January 2008, as an additional external credit assessment 
institution source within the ECAF. The 
Governing Council also decided in 2007 that 
covered bank bonds complying strictly with the 
criteria set out in Article 22(4) of the Directive 
on undertakings for collective investment in 
transferable securities (UCITS Directive) and 
issued after 1 January 2008 will be subject to 
the same credit assessment requirements as 
other marketable assets. 1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS
In 2007 the Eurosystem did not undertake any 
interventions in the foreign exchange market 
for policy reasons. The ECB™s foreign exchange 
transactions were exclusively related to 
investment activity. Furthermore, the ECB did 
not undertake any foreign exchange operations 
in the non-euro area currencies that participate 
in ERM II. The standing agreement between 
the ECB and the IMF to facilitate the initiation 
of special drawing right (SDR) transactions by 
the IMF on behalf of the ECB with other SDR 
holders was activated on 18 occasions in 2007.In the context of the Þ nancial market volatility 
in 2007, the Eurosystem also conducted two operations in connection with the US dollar 
Term Auction Facility of the Federal Reserve 
System, on both occasions providing an 
amount of USD 10 billion to the Eurosystem™s 
counterparties (for more details, see Box 9).1.3 INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
The ECB™s investment activities are organised 
in such a way as to ensure that no insider 
information about central bank policy actions 
may be used when making investment 
decisions. A set of rules and procedures, known 
as the Chinese wall, separates the business units 
involved in operational investment activities 
from other business units.FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio was 

originally set up through transfers of foreign 

reserve assets from the euro area NCBs. Over 

time, the composition of the portfolio reß ects 
changes in the market value of the invested assets, 

as well as foreign exchange and gold operations 

of the ECB. The main purpose of the ECB™s 

foreign reserves is to ensure that, whenever 

needed, the Eurosystem has a sufÞ cient amount 
of liquid resources for its foreign exchange 

policy operations involving non-EU currencies. 

The objectives for the management of the ECB™s 

foreign reserves are, in order of importance, 

liquidity, security and return. 
The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio consists of 
US dollars, Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. The US 

dollar and Japanese yen reserves are actively 

managed by the ECB and the euro area NCBs, as 

agents for the ECB. As of January 2006 a ﬁcurrency 

specialisation modelﬂ has been in operation to 

increase the efÞ ciency of the Eurosystem™s 
investment operations. Under this scheme, each 

NCB is as a rule allocated a share in either the US 

dollar or the Japanese yen portfolio, with two 

NCBs currently managing two.5 In January 2007 
two NCBs (Banka Slovenije and the Banque 

centrale du Luxembourg) pooled their operational 

activities for the management of their share of the 

ECB™s foreign reserves. Two further pooling 

arrangements came into effect in January 2008 

with the entry of the Central Bank of Cyprus and 

the Central Bank of Malta into the Eurosystem 

(see Chapter 3).During 2007 the ECB carried out gold sales amounting to around 79 tonnes of gold in 
total. These sales were in full conformity 
with the Central Bank Gold Agreement dated 
27 September 2004, to which the ECB is a 
signatory. Most of the proceeds of the gold sales For more details, see the article entitled ﬁPortfolio management 5 at the ECBﬂ in the April 2006 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.105ECBAnnual Report
2007were added to the Japanese yen portfolio and, to a minor extent, to the US dollar portfolio. The value of the ECB™s net foreign reserve assets 6 at current exchange rates and market prices increased from •42.3 billion at end-2006 
to •42.8 billion at end-2007, of which 
•32.1 billion was in foreign currencies Œ the 
Japanese yen and the US dollar Œ and •10.7 
billion was in gold and SDRs. Applying the 
exchange rates of end-2007, US dollar-
denominated assets represented 79.7% of the 
foreign currency reserves, while those 
denominated in Japanese yen accounted for 
20.3%. The most substantial change in 2007 
was therefore in the market value of gold and 
SDRs, which rose to •10.7 billion from •10.3 
billion in 2006, mostly as a result of the 
appreciation of gold by around 18% measured 
in euro-denominated terms. The mark-to-market 
value of the foreign currencies in the portfolio 
was broadly unchanged in 2007, with the 
depreciation of the US dollar and the Japanese 
yen vis-à-vis the euro being compensated for by 
the positive net returns (comprising capital gains 
and interest income) generated by portfolio 
management activities and the proceeds from 
the ECB™s gold sales. In 2007 the list of eligible instruments in which 
the ECB™s foreign reserves can be invested was 

extended to include interest rate swaps. In addition, 

the pilot project set up to establish an automatic 

securities lending programme for the ECB™s US 

dollar assets is well advanced and is expected to be 

implemented in the course of 2008. 
OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENT 
The ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of 
the invested counterpart of the ECB™s paid-up 
capital, as well as amounts held from time to 
time in its general reserve fund and its provision 
against foreign exchange rate, interest rate and 
gold price risks. The purpose of this portfolio is 
to provide the ECB with income to help to cover 
its operating expenses. The objective of its 
management is to maximise expected returns, 
subject to a no-loss constraint at a certain conÞ dence level. The portfolio is invested in 
euro-denominated assets.The value of the portfolio at current market prices grew from •7.5 billion at end-2006 to 
•9.3 billion at end-2007. Most of the increase 
in market value was due to the investment in 
the own funds portfolio of the provision against 
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 
price risks established by the ECB in 2005. 
Investment returns also contributed positively to 
the increase in market value. In the course of the year, ß oating rate notes were 
added to the investment options available for the management of this portfolio. In addition, 
the list of eligible issuers of covered bonds and 
senior unsecured bonds was further extended. RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESThe Þ nancial risks to which the ECB is 
exposed in its investment activities are closely 
monitored and measured in order to keep 
them within the levels speciÞ ed by the ECB™s 
decision-making bodies. For this purpose, a 
detailed limit structure is in place and limits are 
monitored daily. Regular reporting ensures that Net foreign reserve assets are calculated as ofÞ cial reserve assets, 
6 plus deposits in foreign currency with residents, minus future predetermined net drains on foreign currency holdings owing 
to repos and forward transactions. For detailed information on 
the data sources, see http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/external/
reserves/templates/html/index.en.html106ECBAnnual Report
2007all stakeholders are adequately informed of the level of such risks. In 2007 the ECB further enhanced its risk 
management capabilities by improving and 

upgrading its IT systems. The enhancements 

mean that many risk monitoring, measuring and 

reporting tasks can be automated within a robust 

and ß exible infrastructure. Moreover, a model-
based performance attribution framework has 

been developed that allows portfolio performance 

to be assigned to exposures to individual risk 

factors. Finally, in recognition of the fact that 

credit risk management techniques are gaining in 

importance within the central bank community, 

the ECB chaired a special Task Force of the 

Market Operations Committee, which carried out 

a comparative analysis of portfolio credit risk 

models used by Eurosystem central banks. The 

results of this analysis were published in the 

ECB™s Occasional Paper Series.7One of the indicators used to monitor market 
risk is Value-at-Risk (VaR), which deÞ nes the 
loss for a portfolio of assets that will not be 
exceeded at the end of a speciÞ ed period of 
time with a given probability. The value of this 
indicator depends on a series of parameters used 
for the calculation, in particular the conÞ dence level, the length of the time horizon and the 
sample used to estimate asset price volatility. As 
an illustration, computing this indicator for the 
ECB™s investment portfolio, using as parameters 
a 95% conÞ dence level, a time horizon of one 
year and a sample of one year for asset price 
volatility, would result in a VaR of •3,500 
million. Computing the same indicator with 
a Þ ve-year sample instead of one year would 
result in a VaR of •4,800 million. Most of this 
market risk is due to currency and gold price 
risk. The low levels of interest rate risk reß ect the fact that the modiÞ ed duration of the ECB™s investment portfolios remained relatively low.For more details, see ﬁThe use of portfolio credit risk models 7 in central banksﬂ by the Task Force of the Market Operations Committee of the ESCB, ECB Occasional Paper No 64,

20072 PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
The Eurosystem has the statutory task of promoting the smooth operation of payment 
systems. Its main instrument for carrying out 
this task Œ aside from the oversight function 
(see Section 4 of Chapter 4) Œ is the provision 
of facilities to ensure efÞ cient and sound 
clearing and payment systems. To this end, 
the Eurosystem created the Trans-European 
Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express 
Transfer system, known as TARGET, for 
large-value and urgent payments in euro. The 
technically decentralised TARGET system is 
being progressively replaced by the TARGET2 
system, which is based on a single technical 
platform that is shared by all participants. A Þ rst group of countries migrated to TARGET2 on 
19 November 2007.With regard to collateral management, the 
Eurosystem and the market offer a number 

of channels to facilitate the use of collateral 

across national borders. Furthermore, the 

Eurosystem, together with market participants, 

is deÞ ning the user requirements for the 
provision of securities settlement services in 

central bank money through a single European 

technical platform with harmonised processes 

and procedures (TARGET2-Securities). Such 

an initiative would ensure that there is no 

difference between conducting domestic and 

cross-border settlements within the euro area.2.1 THE TARGET SYSTEM
TARGET plays an important role in the 
execution of the single monetary policy and the 
functioning of the euro money market. Since 
TARGET offers a real-time settlement service in 
central bank money and broad market coverage, 
it has also attracted a variety of other payments. 
TARGET is available for all credit transfers 
in euro between participating banks, without 
any upper or lower value limit. Such transfers 
may be made both between banks in the same 
Member State (intra-Member State trafÞ c) and 
between those in different Member States (inter-
Member State trafÞ c).TARGET functioned smoothly in 2007 and 
continued to settle an increasing number of euro 
payments. This is in line with the Eurosystem™s 
policy objective of promoting settlement in 
central bank money as a uniquely safe means 
of payment. In 2007 89% of the total value of 
payments in euro large-value payment systems 
were executed via TARGET. The launch of 
TARGET2 on 19 November 2007 also went 
very smoothly (see Section 2.2 of this chapter).About 9,300 banks, including branches and subsidiaries, use TARGET to initiate payments 
on their own behalf or on their customers™ 
behalf. Overall, around 52,000 institutions, 
in particular branches of participants, can be 
addressed through TARGET using a Bank 
IdentiÞ er Code. 
TARGET OPERATIONSIn 2007 the daily average of payments processed 
by TARGET increased by 12.3% in volume 
and 15.6% in value. Table 12 provides an Table 12 Payment traffic in TARGET 1Volume (number of transactions) 20062007

2007overview of the payment trafÞ c in TARGET 
in 2007, comparing it with the trafÞ c in the 
previous year. In 2007 the overall availability of TARGET, i.e. the extent to which participants 
were able to use TARGET during its business 
hours without incident, reached 99.90%. 97.9% 
of inter-Member State payments were processed 
within Þ ve minutes. 
CONTINGENCY MEASURES FOR SYSTEMICALLY 

IMPORTANT PAYMENTS IN TARGETOwing to the TARGET system™s pivotal role in 
the market and its broad market coverage, suitable 
protection against a wide range of threats is 
essential for the reliable and smooth functioning 
of the system. It is crucial that systemically 
important payments Œ i.e. those that could cause a 
systemic risk if not processed when due, notably 
the settlement transactions from the Continuous 
Linked Settlement (CLS) system and EURO1 
(see Section 4.1 of Chapter 4), as well as margin 
calls for central counterparties Œ are carried out 
without delay, even in abnormal circumstances. 
The Eurosystem has established contingency 
measures to ensure that such payments are 
processed in an orderly manner, even in the event 
of TARGET malfunctioning. In 2007 a number 
of further trials were carried out by central 
banks (often involving commercial banks), and 
these proved the effectiveness of the TARGET 
contingency measures. They conÞ rmed that 
the Eurosystem is in a good position to ensure 
that payment systems and Þ nancial markets 
can continue to function smoothly in a crisis 
situation. TARGET CONNECTION FOR THE NCBS OF THE 

MEMBER STATES THAT JOINED THE EU IN 2004 

AND 2007In October 2002 the Governing Council 
decided that, following EU enlargement in 
2004, the NCBs of the new Member States 
would be allowed Œ but not obliged Œ to connect 
to the current TARGET system. Narodowy 
Bank Polski and Eesti Pank connected their
real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems 
to TARGET via the Banca d™Italia™s RTGS 
system in 2005 and 2006 respectively. With 
regard to Slovenia™s entry into the euro area in January 2007, Banka Slovenije decided, 
for efÞ ciency reasons, not to develop its own 
RTGS system, but to use the RTGS system 
of the Deutsche Bundesbank to connect to 
TARGET. When TARGET2 went live in 
November 2007, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania and 
Malta began operations on TARGET2™s single 
shared platform (SSP).RELATIONS WITH TARGET USERS AND RTGS 

SYSTEM OPERATORS OF OTHER CURRENCY AREASThe ESCB maintains close relations with 
TARGET users in order to ensure that their 
needs are given due consideration and receive 
an appropriate response. In 2007, as in previous 
years, regular meetings were held between 
the NCBs linked to TARGET and the national 
TARGET user groups. In addition, joint 
meetings of the ESCB™s Working Group on 
TARGET2 and the TARGET Working Group 
of the European banking industry were held to 
discuss TARGET operational issues and the 
implementation of and migration to TARGET2. 
Strategic issues were addressed in the Contact 
Group on Euro Payments Strategy, a forum in 
which the senior management of commercial and 
central banks is represented. The Eurosystem, as 
operator of the largest RTGS system in the world 
in terms of the value of transactions processed, 
maintained close contacts with the RTGS system 
operators of other key currency areas in 2007. 
Increasing interrelations, such as those stemming 
from CLS operations, have created the need for 
joint discussions on operational issues. 2.2 TARGET2 
The TARGET2 system started operating on 
19 November 2007 when a Þ rst group of 
countries (Germany, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Luxembourg, Malta, Austria and Slovenia) 
migrated their operations to the SSP. The 
second group of countries (Belgium, Ireland, 
Spain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
Finland) migrated to TARGET2 on 18 February 
2008. The third and Þ nal group (consisting of 
Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Poland and the 
ECB) will migrate on 19 May 2008. 109ECBAnnual Report
2007The start of TARGET2 operations was very 
successful. The SSP (operated on behalf of 

the Eurosystem by the Banque de France, the 

Banca d™Italia and the Deutsche Bundesbank) 

achieved a very high level of performance. 

The technical communication with remaining 

TARGET components also functioned 

smoothly. With the Þ rst group of countries, 
some 50% of overall TARGET trafÞ c in 
terms of volume and 30% in terms of value 

migrated to TARGET2. Both these Þ gures 
reached around 80% with the migration of the 

second group of countries. With the launch 

of TARGET2, it is now possible to process 

interbank direct debits as well as credit 

transfers. Moreover, with TARGET2, ancillary 

systems are able to conduct settlement directly 

on the SSP. Each participant is, in principle, 

able to conduct its cash settlement with any 

ancillary system through a single central bank 

account in TARGET2.In view of the start of operations of TARGET2, 
throughout 2007 work was conducted to 

Þ nalise the operational and legal frameworks. 
In particular, the testing and migration 

activities with future users of the system were 

thoroughly prepared and carried out. Between 

February and April 2007 the compliance of 

TARGET2™s SSP with the system speciÞ cations 
deÞ ned by the Eurosystem in cooperation with 
users (general functional speciÞ cations (GFS) 
and user detailed functional speciÞ cations 
(UDFS)) was tested. The tests involving 

TARGET2 users started as planned on 2 May 

2007, with the results made available through 

regular status reports. The tests also presented 

the opportunity to assess the planning of 

the changeover weekends. In particular, a 

fully-ß edged ﬁrehearsalﬂ of the 
Þ rst 
changeover weekend took place with all 

NCBs on 29 and 30 September 2007. In a 

press release on 9 November 2007, following 

the successful completion of its tests, the 

Eurosystem acknowledged the readiness 

of the national banking communities of the 

Þ rst migration group and con
Þ rmed that the 
new system would go live, as scheduled, on
19 November 2007. 
On 22 June 2007 the Governing Council released 
the ﬁFourth progress report on TARGET2ﬂ. The 
objective of the report was to update market 
participants on the Eurosystem™s decisions on 
outstanding issues related to pricing and on the 
approval of the TARGET2 Guideline, as well as 
to Þ ne-tune some previous decisions. The report 
also contained the Þ nal version of the GFS and 
provided information on legal issues, on recent 
changes to the envisaged functionality of the 
SSP, and on testing and migration activities. 
In addition, on 29 October 2007 the Governing 
Council released the ﬁFifth progress report on 
TARGET2ﬂ, which updated market participants 
on the Eurosystem™s decisions concerning 
remaining operational issues. The report also 
included the ﬁInformation guide for TARGET2 
usersﬂ and the ﬁUser information guide to the 
TARGET2 pricingﬂ.The ﬁInformation guide for TARGET2 usersﬂ provides banks and ancillary systems using 
TARGET2 with a standard set of information 
to give the participants a better understanding 
of the overall functioning of TARGET2 
and enable them to use it as efÞ ciently as 
possible. It answers the most frequently asked 
questions relating to TARGET2 and attempts, 
in particular, to provide users with a clear 
understanding of those features that are common 
and those that are speciÞ c to each country. In 
addition, the guide contains information about 
the operational procedures in normal and, more 
speciÞ cally, abnormal situations.
The ﬁUser information guide to the TARGET2 pricingﬂ gives TARGET2 users a comprehensive 
overview of the pricing schemes related to 
TARGET2 (core services, liquidity pooling 
and ancillary system services) and details of 
the billing principles for the various types of 
transaction, as well as the entities to be invoiced. In addition to these progress reports and the close cooperation with users in the Þ eld of testing and 
migration, users were kept informed of progress 
via the ECB and NCB websites dedicated to 
TARGET2. The websites contained information 
on the following developments: 110ECBAnnual Report
2007A user-focused plan for TARGET2 was  Œ
created and regularly updated throughout 2007 as a tool to facilitate users™ internal 
planning and alignment with the Eurosystem 
planning.In the course of 2007 regular workshops  Œ
with users took place at the national level. In addition, at the European level a TARGET2 
information session for users was held at the 
ECB on 14 June 2007. The TARGET2 Guideline was adopted by  Œ
the Governing Council on 26 April 2007 and published in all ofÞ cial EU languages 
on 11 June 2007. It is addressed to the 
NCBs of the Member States that have 
adopted the euro (ﬁEurosystem NCBsﬂ) 
and also applies, on the basis of a separate 
agreement, to EU NCBs outside the euro 
area that are connected or will connect to 
TARGET2 (ﬁconnected NCBsﬂ). Annex II 
to the Guideline contains the harmonised 
conditions for participation in TARGET2, 
which have to be implemented in the 
TARGET2 documentation of all participating 
and connected NCBs. The Guideline was 
published in the OfÞ cial Journal of the 
European Union on 8 September 2007 and 
is also available on the ECB™s website in all 
EU languages. The national migration proÞ les and the 
 Œ
ancillary system proÞ les were regularly 
updated throughout the year. These proÞ les show, for each central bank, which SSP modules will be used and how ancillary 
systems will settle after migration to 
TARGET2. A Þ nal version of the user handbook for the 
 Œ
information and control module of the SSP was published on 2 November 2007, while 
Þ nal versions of the UDFS (books 1, 2 and 
4 on XML messages and their corresponding 
XML scheme Þ les) were published on 
9 October 2007. 2.3 TARGET2-SECURITIESThe objective of the TARGET2-Securities 
(T2S) initiative is to provide harmonised and 
efÞ cient settlement of securities transactions in 
central bank money in euro, by concentrating 
securities and cash settlements in euro within 
a single platform. With T2S there would be no 
difference between conducting domestic and 
cross-border settlements within the euro area 
in participating central securities depositories 
(CSDs). It would therefore act as a catalyst to 
the integration and harmonisation of European 
post-trading Þ nancial services. T2S would also 
foster competition by providing equal, cheaper 
and harmonised access to settlement services 
within the European Þ nancial market.
On 8 March 2007 the Governing Council made 
a positive assessment of the feasibility of T2S 8 and decided to launch the next phase of the 
project, consisting of the deÞ nition of the T2S 
user requirements, in full transparency and in 
cooperation with market participants, in 
particular CSDs and their users. On 
26 April 2007 the Governing Council launched 
the Þ rst public consultation on the general T2S 
principles and the high-level proposals deÞ ning the nature and scope of T2S, and approved the 
establishment of a framework for the 
organisation and governance of the preparation 
of the T2S user requirements. The Advisory 
Group Œ assigned with the mandate of delivering 
the user requirements Œ divided the work 
between six different technical groups focusing 
on speciÞ c technical areas of settlement. The 
Advisory Group and the technical groups started 
the preparatory work in early summer 2007 and 
conducted a total of seven ﬁmini-consultationsﬂ, 
requesting feedback from national user groups 
and European associations in order to draw on 
the wealth of knowledge and experience 
accumulated in the various market segments. 
The Þ ndings and progress reports were shared 
The feasibility study, which covered operational, technical, legal 8 and economic aspects of the project, was published on the ECB™s website. 111ECBAnnual Report
2007with market participants during three information sessions held in June, August and November 
2007. All T2S documents, including mini-
consultations, newsletters, progress reports, 
agendas and meeting summaries, are available 
on the ECB™s website. In total, the T2S 
governance structure during this phase 
involves more than 188 individuals from 
77 organisations 9, ensuring that all user requirements and functionalities required by 
market participants are addressed and included 
where appropriate. The Advisory Group, which 
reports directly to the Governing Council, 
completed the Þ rst draft version of the T2S user 
requirements in December 2007.On 8 March 2007 the Governing Council also 
decided that T2S would be fully owned, developed 

and operated within the Eurosystem on the 

TARGET2 platform in order to exploit synergies 

to the fullest extent. Credit institutions would be 

able to pool all securities and central bank money 

on a single platform, instead of distributing 

securities and central bank money across several 

independent national platforms, thereby beneÞ ting 
from the synergies between TARGET2 and T2S. 

This should increase the efÞ ciency of collateral 
management. T2S would also enable a faster 

re-use of securities and central bank money, 

which would be of beneÞ t to market participants. 
Four euro area NCBs (the Deutsche Bundesbank, 

the Banco de España, the Banque de France and 

the Banca d™Italia) are prepared to develop and 

operate T2S.Public authorities such as the European Parliament, the ECOFIN Council and the 
European Commission were regularly informed 
throughout 2007 about the latest developments 
with regard to the T2S proposal and expressed 
support for the T2S project.With respect to legal issues, a comprehensive 
stocktaking exercise was undertaken during 2007 

covering the EU and national legislation, and other 

national arrangements and practices, that could 

have a bearing on the legal feasibility of T2S. 

This exercise included settlement procedures, 

data storage requirements, and reporting and 
auditing requirements. No major legal obstacles 

to the T2S initiative were identiÞ ed.A further public consultation, on the fully 

articulated user requirements and the methodology 

for economic impact analysis, was launched at 

the end of 2007, requesting market stakeholders 

to provide comments and suggestions by 

2 April 2008. Following this public consultation, 

the user requirements will be Þ nalised, together 
with an assessment of the economic, legal and 

governance structure of the T2S initiative. The 

Governing Council will then decide whether to 

enter the next phase of the project.With the implementation of T2S, the euro area would beneÞ t from a safe, ef
Þ cient and 
borderless infrastructure for the settlement in 
central bank money of securities transactions in 
euro. The services provided by this infrastructure 
would also be available to CSDs, central banks 
and banks in other EU and EEA countries if 
requested. Financial market participants would 
have one common set of harmonised settlement 
procedures and processes regardless of their 
own location and that of the trade.2.4 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR COLLATERAL 
Eligible assets may be used to collateralise 
all types of Eurosystem credit operation not 
only at the domestic level but also across 
national borders, the latter only by means 
of the correspondent central banking model 
(CCBM) or through eligible links between euro 
area securities settlement systems (SSSs). The 
CCBM is provided by the Eurosystem, while 
eligible links are a market-led solution. The amount of cross-border collateral held by the Eurosystem increased to •683 billion in 
December 2007, from •514 billion in the same 
month of the previous year. Overall, at the end 
of 2007 cross-border collateral represented 
48.5% of the total collateral provided to 
the Eurosystem. This includes all CSDs settling in euro and 33 custodian banks.9 112ECBAnnual Report
2007THE CORRESPONDENT CENTRAL BANKING MODELThe CCBM has remained the main channel for transferring cross-border collateral in 
Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit 
operations. It accounted for 39.6% of the total 
collateral provided to the Eurosystem in 2007. 
Assets held in custody through the CCBM 
increased from •414 billion at the end of 2006 
to •558 billion at the end of 2007. The CCBM framework has been revised in order to allow for the integration of new euro 
area countries. In this context, the CCBM 
Agreement with the Central Bank of Malta 
and the Central Bank of Cyprus was signed on 
22 November 2007. Despite its success and considerable contribution to the process of Þ nancial integration, the 
CCBM arrangement has a number of drawbacks, 
mainly linked to the fact that it was designed as 
an interim solution and relies on the principle of 
minimum harmonisation. These drawbacks, in 
combination with the growing importance of 
cross-border collateral, led to the Governing 
Council decision of 8 March 2007
 10 to review the current Eurosystem collateral management 
handling procedures and to create a new 
collateral management system for the 
Eurosystem (based on existing systems such as 
that of the Nationale Bank van België/Banque 
Nationale de Belgique and De Nederlandsche 
Bank), called Collateral Central Bank 
Management, or CCBM2. The participation of 
the euro area NCBs in CCBM2 is of a 
voluntary nature.Although CCBM2 is primarily designed to increase the efÞ ciency of the collateral 
management of Eurosystem central banks, for 
both cross-border and domestic transactions, it 
will also bring new opportunities for Eurosystem 
counterparties, particularly multi-country banks, 
to optimise their collateral use and enhance their 
liquidity management. The scope of CCBM2 
goes beyond that of the current CCBM and 
will establish efÞ cient methods for delivering 
and accepting both securities and credit claims 
at the domestic and cross-border levels with a harmonised level of service based on SWIFT 
communication protocols. CCBM2 will be 
implemented in accordance with the principle 
of decentralised access to credit and will be 
fully compatible with TARGET2 and T2S. 
CCBM2 will process instructions in real time on 
a straight-through-processing basis, permitting 
the delivery of collateral to generate the release 
of related credit in TARGET2 on a real-time 
basis. It will be able to take collateral through 
all eligible SSSs and eligible linkages between 
them. In order to integrate counterparties™ 
needs, the Eurosystem is developing CCBM2 
in close cooperation with market participants. 
A Þ rst public consultation on the principles for 
its development was launched on 26 April 2007. 
The comments received have been used as input 
for the deÞ nition of the user requirements for 
the new platform. A further public consultation 
on these user requirements is taking place 
in the Þ rst half of 2008, after which the user 
requirements for CCBM2 will be Þ nalised.ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES 

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSNational SSSs can be linked by means of 
contractual and operational arrangements to 
allow the cross-border transfer of eligible 
securities between systems. Once eligible 
securities have been transferred via such links 
to another SSS, they can be used through local 
procedures in the same way as any domestic 
collateral. 59 direct and 5 relayed links are 
currently available to counterparties, but only 
a limited number of them are actively used. 
Furthermore, these links only cover part of the 
euro area. Links become eligible for Eurosystem 
credit operations if they fulÞ l the Eurosystem™s 
user standards (see Section 4 of Chapter 4). The amount of collateral held through links increased from •99 billion in December 2006 to 
•125 billion in December 2007, but accounted 
for only 8.9% of the total collateral (both 
cross-border and domestic) held by the 
Eurosystem in 2007. See http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/coll/coll/ccbm2/html/index.10 en.html113ECBAnnual Report
20073.1 THE CIRCULATION OF BANKNOTES AND 
COINS AND THE HANDLING OF CURRENCYDEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINSAt the end of 2007 the number of euro banknotes in circulation stood at 12.1 billion, with a value 
of •676.6 billion, which represented an increase 
of 6.7% in terms of volume and 7.7% in terms 
of value compared with the levels at the end of 
2006 (11.3 billion banknotes with a value of 
•628.2 billion). The number of banknotes in circulation has 
continued to expand since the cash changeover in 

2002, although at a declining annual growth rate 

(see Charts 45 and 46). At the end of 2007 the 
average value of a banknote in circulation was 

•55.85 (compared with •55.36 one year before). 
It is estimated that, in value terms, between 10% and 20% Œ but potentially a Þ gure closer to the 
upper end of the range Œ of the euro banknotes in 
circulation are held by non-euro area residents, 
who continue to generate demand for euro 
banknotes, mainly as a store of value or as a 
parallel currency. Looking at a breakdown of the denominations, the •50 and •100 banknotes showed the 
strongest growth in circulation in numerical 
terms, rising by 8.9% and 8.3% respectively, 
followed by the •500 banknote, which rose by 3 BANKNOTES AND COINS

20077.9%. The number of the other denominations in circulation rose at rates of between 2% and 
6% (see Chart 47). In 2007 the total number of euro coins in circulation (i.e. net circulation excluding stocks 
held by the NCBs) grew by 9.1% to 75.8 billion, 
while the value of coins in circulation rose by 
7.6% to •19.2 billion. The share of the small 
denominations, the 1, 2 and 5 cent coins, in the 
total number of coins in circulation reached 
58.0% (compared with 57.3% one year earlier). 
Anecdotal evidence suggests that this continuing 
strong demand for low-value coins is explained 
by relatively high loss rates and hoarding.BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEMThe slight upward trend observed in euro 
banknote issues and withdrawals in previous 
years continued. In 2007 the euro area NCBs 
issued 33.4 billion banknotes, while 32.7 billion 
banknotes were returned to them. The return 
frequency 11 of banknotes in circulation fell slightly from 3.03 in 2006 to 2.93 in 2007. The euro area NCBs check each euro banknote returned to them for authenticity and Þ tness using fully automated banknote processing 
machines in order to maintain the quality and 
integrity of the banknotes in circulation. In 2007 
the NCBs identiÞ ed some 5.5 billion banknotes 
as being unÞ t for circulation and replaced them 
accordingly. This represented an increase of 
5.1% compared with the previous year and an 
unÞ t rate 
12 of 17.0% (16.9% in 2006). 3.2 BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITING 
AND COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCECOUNTERFEIT EURO BANKNOTES 
The number of counterfeit euro banknotes 
removed from circulation has remained stable 
over the last four years, despite the increase in 
the number of genuine banknotes in circulation 
over the same period. Chart 48 shows the trend 
in counterfeits removed from circulation, with 
Þ gures taken at half-yearly intervals since the 
euro banknotes were launched. The total number of counterfeits received by National Analysis 
Centres 13 in 2007 was around 566,000 14.Compared with the number of genuine euro 
banknotes in circulation, which was on average 
more than 11 billion in 2007, the quantity of 
counterfeits is very small indeed. The •50 
banknote was the counterfeiters™ biggest target, 
accounting for nearly half of the number 
of counterfeits. Chart 49 gives a detailed 
breakdown of the distribution of counterfeits in 
terms of volume. The public can remain conÞ dent in the security of 
the euro: it has proven to be a well-protected 
currency, in terms of both the sophistication of its 

security features and the effectiveness of European 

and national law enforcement authorities. 

However, this conÞ dence should never give rise 
to complacency, and the ECB™s advice to the 

public is to be alert to the possibility of fraud and 

to remember the ﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ test.15DeÞ ned as the total number of banknotes returned to NCBs in

2007COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCEThe Eurosystem continued in 2007 to work closely with Europol and the European 
Commission (in particular the European Anti-
Fraud OfÞ ce, OLAF) in the 
Þ ght against 
counterfeiting of the euro. The Eurosystem is 
active, both in the EU and beyond, in training 
professional cash handlers in the recognition 
and handling of counterfeit banknotes. The Eurosystem participates actively in the work of the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence 
Group (CBCDG) (a working group of 30 central 
banks and note-printing authorities cooperating 
under the auspices of the G10). The ECB 
hosts the International Counterfeit Deterrence 
Centre (ICDC), which acts as the technical 
centre for all CBCDG members. Its main role 
is to provide technical support and to operate 
a centralised communication system serving 
all parties involved in the Þ eld of counterfeit 
deterrence systems. The ICDC also maintains 
a public website which provides information 
and guidance concerning the reproduction of 
banknote images as well as links to country-
speciÞ c websites. 
3.3 BANKNOTE ISSUANCE AND PRODUCTION
FRAMEWORK FOR RECYCLING BANKNOTESFollowing the transposition of the ECB™s framework for the detection of counterfeits and 
the sorting of banknotes for Þ tness by credit 
institutions and other professional cash handlers 
(ﬁBanknote Recycling Frameworkﬂ, or BRF) 
into national arrangements by all euro area 
NCBs (with the exception of one, for which the 
process is pending), credit institutions and other 
professional cash handlers have been given a 
transitional period to adjust their cash handling 
procedures. In implementing the BRF, the NCBs have followed a variety of approaches that take 
into account differences in national situations
(e.g. as regards the economic and legal 
environment, the banking structure, and the 
role of the NCB in the cash cycle). While in a 
few countries the BRF has been implemented 
by means of a legal act (complemented by 
mandatory contracts to be signed with the 
respective NCB), in other countries, NCBs 
have issued obligatory instructions (which in 
some cases bind only credit institutions) or 
entered into bilateral contractual agreements 
(whereby credit institutions agree to adhere to 
the rules of the BRF and to include those rules 
in contracts with their service providers). In 
an opinion in December 2007 the Governing 
Council welcomed the European Commission™s 
proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) 
1338/2001 on the protection of the euro against 
counterfeiting. In accordance with this proposal, 
Article 6 of the Regulation would include the 
express obligation for credit institutions and 
other professional cash handlers to check euro 
banknotes and coins which they have received 
and that they intend to put back into circulation, 
and would also contain a reference to the 
procedures to be deÞ ned by the ECB as regards 
the method for checking recycled banknotes.The ECB continued its efforts, in close cooperation with the euro area NCBs, to ensure 
the uniform interpretation of the provisions of 
the BRF throughout the euro area, especially Chart 49 Distribution of euro banknote 
counterfeits by denomination•10019%•2009%•5001%•51%•102%•2020%•5048%Source: ECB.116ECBAnnual Report
2007with regard to the Eurosystem™s common test procedure for banknote handling machines.By adapting their operations in accordance with the BRF, credit institutions and other 
professional cash handlers will strengthen 
their ability to detect potential counterfeit euro 
banknotes. This will contribute effectively to 
their compliance with the legal obligation to 
remove potential counterfeits from circulation 
immediately and to make them available 
to law enforcement authorities for further 
investigation. Furthermore, it will ensure 
that credit institutions supply customers with 
banknotes that are in good physical condition, 
thus helping them to distinguish between 
genuine and counterfeit banknotes. THE EXTENDED CUSTODIAL INVENTORY PILOT 

PROGRAMMEThe Governing Council decided in 2006 to 
launch an Extended Custodial Inventory (ECI) 
pilot programme for euro banknotes in Asia. 
An ECI is a cash depot maintained by a private 
bank (ECI bank) that holds currency on a 
custodial basis. ECIs are expected to facilitate 
the international distribution of euro banknotes 
and to provide statistical data on euro banknote 
circulation outside the euro area, as well as 
information on counterfeits. In 2007 two large 
commercial banks active in the wholesale 
banknote market each began operating, for a 
one-year period, an ECI for euro banknotes: one 
in Hong Kong and one in Singapore. During the pilot programme the ECI banks ensured that only Þ t banknotes were
recirculated and that counterfeits were 
withdrawn from circulation according to 
the standards speciÞ ed by the BRF. Surplus 
banknotes and banknotes unÞ t for circulation 
were shipped to the Deutsche Bundesbank, 
which acted as the logistical and administrative 
counterpart for the ECI banks. The ECI 
operations and statistical reporting of the ECI 
banks proceeded smoothly. On the basis of this pilot programme, the Governing Council will decide in 2008 whether such an ECI programme should be established 
on a permanent basis. ROADMAP FOR GREATER CONVERGENCE OF NCB 

CASH SERVICESIn February 2007 the Governing Council 
adopted a roadmap with the aim of achieving, 
in the medium term, greater convergence in the 
cash services offered by the Eurosystem. Greater convergence is important because it will allow stakeholders Œ in particular those with 
signiÞ cant cross-border cash activities Œ to fully 
reap the beneÞ ts of the single currency, and will 
ensure fair competitive treatment. In view of the 
different national economic and geographical 
environments, the Eurosystem does not envisage 
a ﬁone-size-Þ ts-allﬂ cash supply system. The 
process of convergence will require some 
ß exibility regarding customer requirements, the 
cash infrastructure and transitional periods for 
implementation. As part of the roadmap, since July 2007 NCBs have provided cash services upon request to 
euro area credit institutions established outside 
their jurisdiction (ﬁnon-resident banksﬂ) and, 
since the end of 2007, euro coin lodgements 
from professional clients have been accepted at 
all euro area NCBs. The Eurosystem is still considering a number of further steps, including electronic data exchange 
with credit institutions for cash lodgements and 
withdrawals, orientation-independent banknote 
lodgements and withdrawals as a common free-
of-charge NCB service, and common banknote 
packaging standards for the free-of-charge NCB 
cash services.As these issues have a bearing on stakeholders in 
the cash cycle and could have operational and cost 

implications, consultations have been conducted at 

both the national and the European level. 
PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTSA total of 6.3 billion euro banknotes were 
produced in 2007, compared with 7.0 billion in 
2006. This reduction in the production volume 117ECBAnnual Report
2007was primarily due to a slightly smaller increase in circulation in 2006 than in the previous year 
and the production in 2006 of part of the future 
banknote requirements.The allocation of euro banknote production continued to be based on the decentralised 
production scenario with pooling adopted in 
2002. Under this arrangement, each euro area 
NCB is responsible for the procurement of 
an allocated share of the total requirement for 
certain denominations (see Table 13). THE SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTES 
In April 2005 the Governing Council approved a 

master plan for the development and introduction of 

the second series of euro banknotes. Since then, the 

ECB has established the functional and technical 

requirements for the banknotes by seeking input 

from various stakeholders, for example through 

qualitative research activities among members 

of the public and scientiÞ c visual perception and 
tactility studies. These activities resulted in a 

shortlist of user-friendly security features which 

were regarded as potentially suitable for inclusion 

in the second series of banknotes. During the 

subsequent industrial validation phase, the shortlist 

was reduced on the basis of the performance of 

the security features in a large-scale production 

environment. Other aspects were also taken 

into consideration, such as the resilience of the 

security features to counterfeiting, quality control 

requirements, cost, intellectual property rights and 

supply chain situations, as well as health, safety 

and environmental issues. 
In August 2007 the industrial validation phase 
was largely completed. It resulted in a package 
of security features which the Governing 
Council adopted in October 2007. In addition to 
traditional security features which have proven 
their effectiveness, several innovative visual and 
machine-readable security features will be 
integrated into the second series of banknotes, 
with a view to effectively thwarting modern 
counterfeiting techniques. The selected security 
features have now been embedded in the artistic 
design, which is based on the ﬁages and stylesﬂ 
theme of the current series. Keeping this theme, 
while redesigning the graphical elements, will 
ensure that the new banknotes are immediately 
recognisable as euro banknotes, yet allow cash 
users to distinguish easily between the two 
series of banknotes. In December 2007 the 
Governing Council approved the draft design of 
the new series of banknotes, paving the way for 
the origination 16 phase. The new series will be launched over a period of several years, and the 
Þ rst denomination is expected to be issued in a 
few years™ time. The ECB will inform the public 
well in advance about the modalities of the 
introduction of the new banknotes. ﬁOriginationﬂ covers the process of high-quality image 16 preparation and the transformation of designs into production tools, such as printing plates.Table 13 Allocation of euro banknote

2007The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a wide 
range of statistics which support the monetary 
policy of the euro area and various tasks of the 
ESCB. They are also increasingly used by the 
Þ nancial markets and the general public. As in 
previous years, in 2007 the provision of euro 
area statistics proceeded smoothly. A major 
milestone in the ECB™s medium-term strategy 
for statistics was reached in June 2007, with the 
Þ rst joint ECB/Eurostat publication of a set of 
quarterly integrated non-Þ nancial and 
Þ nancial accounts for the institutional sectors of the euro 
area. In addition, the ECB, in close collaboration 
with the NCBs, continued to contribute to the 
further harmonisation of statistical concepts 
in Europe and to the review of core global 
statistical standards.4.1 NEW OR ENHANCED EURO AREA STATISTICS
In June 2007 the ECB and Eurostat jointly 
published, for the Þ rst time, a set of quarterly 
integrated euro area non-Þ nancial and 
Þ nancial sector accounts starting from the Þ rst quarter of 
1999. These euro area accounts, which can be 
considered as ﬁnational accountsﬂ for the euro 
area, are prepared by the Eurosystem together 
with Eurostat and the national statistical 
institutes. Among other things, they allow a 
comprehensive analysis of the links between 
Þ nancial and non-
Þ nancial developments in the 
economy and of the interrelations among the 
different sectors of the economy (households, 
non-Þ nancial corporations, 
Þ nancial corporations 
and general government) and between these 
sectors and the rest of the world.The euro area accounts also provide a framework for analysing higher frequency data 
in a more comprehensive way. In this regard, the 
publication, since November 2007, of a sectoral 
breakdown of the broad monetary aggregate M3 
has further enhanced the scope for monetary 
analysis. In April 2007 the existing monthly statistics on outstanding amounts of Short-Term European Paper (STEP) were supplemented by daily 
statistics on yields, with breakdowns by initial 
maturity and sector of issuer (see Section 3 of 
Chapter 4).In July 2007 the ECB began the electronic publication of daily yield curves reß ecting the 
implicit market remuneration rates of euro area 
central government debt securities denominated 
in euro (based on the interest rate and the 
market price) for a wide spectrum of maturities, 
ranging from 3 months to 30 years. The euro 
area yield curves can assist in gauging market 
expectations of economic and Þ nancial activity 
over a medium to long-term horizon.The ECB has also compiled and released, on an experimental basis, monthly HICP-based 
estimates of administered prices in the euro 
area, using information on HICP sub-indices 
published by Eurostat and deÞ nitions agreed 
within the ESCB.Additional geographical breakdowns 17 for quarterly balance of payments ß ows and annual international investment position data have been made available through regular press releases 
and the ECB™s online Statistical Data Warehouse 
(SDW).18The legal framework for the collection of 
monetary and Þ nancial statistics was enhanced 
with a new ECB Regulation concerning statistics 
on the assets and liabilities of investment funds 
(other than money market funds), under which 
investment funds will report harmonised data 
from early 2009. The Governing Council 
also adopted a recast Guideline on monetary, 
Þ nancial institution and market statistics, which 
now includes further provisions for statistics on 
investment funds™ assets and liabilities and for 
payments statistics. In addition, the Governing For Brazil, Russia, India, China and Hong Kong SAR.17 The public version of the SDW was launched on the internet 18 at the end of 2006 and was welcomed by users of euro area statistics. Owing to its robust and easy-to-use interfaces, it 
has quickly become a popular tool for searching for euro area 
data on the internet. Each month around 20,000 people use the 
SDW to Þ nd and download euro area data, including national 
breakdowns.4 STATISTICS119ECBAnnual Report
2007Council amended the ECB Guideline and Recommendation on balance of payments and 
international investment position statistics and 
the international reserves template.Work is under way in several areas to further improve the euro area monetary and Þ nancial statistics in the coming years. In particular, 
preparations have been made for an integrated 
approach to MFI securitisation and the activities 
of Þ nancial vehicle corporations, paving the 
way for greatly enhanced availability of data on 
loan sales and loan securitisation. In addition, the Eurosystem is exploring the feasibility of enhancing statistical data on 
insurance corporations and pension funds. The 
regulatory framework for MFI balance sheet 
statistics and MFI interest rate statistics is also 
under review, with the aim of accommodating 
new user demands and evolving Þ nancial markets in a cost-effective way.The ECB continued to work on the development of a Centralised Securities Database (CSDB). 
The CSDB, an ESCB-wide project, is a single 
database containing benchmark information on 
individual securities that are relevant for the 
statistical purposes of the ESCB. The project 
is playing a pivotal role in the move towards 
security-by-security reporting, which has the 
potential to signiÞ cantly alleviate the reporting 
burden for respondents while improving the 
quality and ß exibility of euro area statistics. 
The database is already used by some NCBs to 
compile national Þ nancial statistics.
4.2 OTHER STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENTS
In 2007 the Eurosystem analysed in detail 
possible ways to further increase the efÞ ciency of the production of ECB statistics, also with 
a view to keeping the statistical burden to a 
minimum. In this context, further work was 
conducted on the feasibility of reusing existing 
micro-data, in particular from credit registers and 
central balance sheet data ofÞ ces. In addition, 
work continued with a view to promoting the alignment of statistical and supervisory concepts 
and data, focusing initially on the reporting 
requirements of credit institutions.Several documents published in 2007 helped to increase transparency on the governance 
and quality standards currently applied to the 
production and dissemination of ECB and 
ESCB statistics. The document entitled ﬁThe 
ESCB™s governance structure as applied to 
ESCB statisticsﬂ provides a brief overview of 
the governance structure guiding the provision 
of statistics by the ECB and the NCBs. The 
ﬁPublic commitment with respect to the ESCB™s 
statistical functionﬂ featured on the Þ rst page of the statistics section of the ECB™s website states 
the statistical principles and ethical and quality 
standards to which the ECB and the NCBs are 
committed when performing their statistical 
tasks. Furthermore, the ﬁECB Statistics Quality 
Frameworkﬂ elaborates on the quality principles 
that guide the production of ECB statistics. 
Qualitative assessments and quantitative 
indicators, such as those contained in the annual 
quality report on the euro area balance of 
payments and international investment position 
statistics, are provided regularly as part of this 
quality framework.The dissemination of statistics was further enhanced through the publication of additional 
tables on euro area statistics and all corresponding 
national data on the websites of both the ECB 
and the NCBs. Payments statistics have also 
been enhanced and the Blue Book Addendum 
has been replaced by time series and tables 
which can be found on the ECB™s website (see 
Section 2 of Chapter 2). In addition, new data 
on securities trading and central counterparties 
have been made available.As in previous years, the statistical information provided in the ECB™s publications has been 
made more comprehensive. Examples include 
the wide range of indicators presented in the 
annual report entitled ﬁFinancial integration in 
Europeﬂ and the addendum to the publication 
ﬁBond markets and long-term interest rates in 
non-euro area Member States of the European 120ECBAnnual Report
2007Union and in accession countriesﬂ (see Section 3 of Chapter 4). Annual data on banking structures 
and quarterly data underpinning the Financial 
Stability Review were further improved. The 
euro money market survey was enhanced, in 
terms of both data quality and timeliness, and the 
underlying datasets have been made available in 
the SDW.An ECB Occasional Paper entitled ﬁTowards harmonised balance of payments and 
international investment position statistics Œ 
the experience of the European compilersﬂ, 
published in July 2007, provides an overview 
of the methodological framework and practical 
issues related to the collection, compilation and 
dissemination of these statistics.The ECB continued to cooperate closely with Eurostat and other international organisations 
and has played an important role in the current 
update of global statistical standards (with the 
work on the System of National Accounts (SNA 
93) and the IMF Balance of Payments Manual 
due to be completed by 2008). Eurostat, 
supported by the ECB, has recently started to 
prepare for the revision of the ESA 95, which 
will implement most of the changes to the SNA 
at the European level. The ECB was also 
actively involved in reviewing the OECD 
Benchmark DeÞ nition of Foreign Direct 
Investment. Finally, it continued to support and 
implement global technical standards for data 
exchange.194.3 PREPARING FOR EURO AREA ENLARGEMENT 
Statistics also play an important role in 
monitoring the convergence of EU Member 
States that do not yet belong to the euro area 
and, hence, in the preparation of the convergence 
reports (see Section 1.2 of Chapter 5). The statistical data needed to assess the progress made by Member States in fulÞ lling the 
convergence criteria on price stability, Þ scal positions, exchange rates and long-term interest 
rates are provided by Eurostat. The ECB, together with the NCBs of the Member States 
concerned, assists Eurostat with the provision 
of long-term interest rate statistics and collects 
and compiles additional statistical data which 
supplement the four primary convergence 
indicators. Since the assessment of the convergence process is highly dependent on the quality and integrity 
of the underlying statistics, the ECB closely 
monitors developments in the compilation 
and reporting of these statistics, particularly 
government Þ nance statistics. 
For example, the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange 19 (SDMX), an initiative supported by the BIS, the ECB, Eurostat, the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World Bank, 
which serves to foster global standards for the exchange of 
statistical information.121ECBAnnual Report
20075 ECONOMIC RESEARCH 
The main functions of research at the ECB, as well as in the Eurosystem as a whole, are: to 
provide research results that are relevant for the 
formulation of policy advice on monetary policy 
and other Eurosystem tasks, and to design and 
implement the respective models and analytical 
tools; to maintain and use econometric models 
for economic forecasts and the comparison 
of the effects of alternative policies; and to 
communicate with the academic community, 
for example through the publication of research 
results in external journals and the organisation 
of research conferences.5.1 RESEARCH PRIORITIES
At the ECB economic research is mainly 
conducted by the Directorate General Research, 
but also by several other business areas. A 
Research Coordination Committee coordinates 
the research, setting priorities and bringing 
together the business areas which are requesting 
or supplying research.The following Þ elds were the main 
research priorities for 2007: forecasting model development; the role of Þ nancial sector 
information, including credit and monetary 
aggregates, in monetary policy analysis; 
understanding the transmission mechanism 
of monetary policy; Þ nancial stability; the 
efÞ ciency of the European 
Þ nancial system; and 
international issues.With respect to forecasting model development, the focus was on the further development and 
use of structural dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) models and on the 
implementation of dynamic factor models for 
short-term forecasting purposes. DSGE models 
have been developed and used in the past at the 
ECB for the analysis of a large and growing 
number of policy issues. This work continued in 
2007, with particular emphasis on the impact of 
structural change (e.g. demographics), external 
factors (e.g. oil price shocks), productivity 
developments and Þ nancial issues (e.g. credit 
frictions). Furthermore, work on two medium-scale models and their use for policy analysis 
continued: the New Area-Wide Model (NAWM) 
and the Christiano, Motto and Rostagno model. 
The Þ rst is a forecasting and simulation tool being 
developed for use, together with other models, 
in the context of the Eurosystem and ECB 
projection exercises. The second is a simulation 
tool with special emphasis on Þ nancial factors. 
As regards the development of forecasting tools, 
factor-based models were further developed and 
increasingly used for the short-term assessment 
of economic developments. Finally, the ECB 
actively supported the Euro Area Business Cycle 
Network, a joint venture between central banks 
and the academic community managed by the 
Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR).Research on monetary policy analysis centred on the development and use of quantitative 
methods for the monetary analysis, with an 
emphasis on providing high-quality analytical 
tools for the preparation of policy decisions. 
Work focused on developing money-based 
indicator models for inß ation and on analysing 
money demand, as well as on introducing the 
structural models described above into the 
policy analysis process.The monetary policy transmission mechanism was investigated from a number of perspectives. 
The Wage Dynamics Network (WDN), a 
network of ESCB researchers that investigates 
the features and sources of wage dynamics in 
the euro area and their relationship with prices, 
continued its work at both the aggregate and the 
micro level. The WDN survey group launched 
an ad hoc survey on wages, labour costs and 
price-setting behaviour at the Þ rm level in 17 
countries. The survey collects information 
on wage and price-setting, downward wage 
rigidity and the adjustment of wages and prices 
to shocks. The Þ rst set of research 
Þ ndings will 
be presented at a conference planned for 2008. 
Housing markets were also analysed, as well 
as the role of banks and credit in the monetary 
transmission mechanism. Work on household 
Þ nances was further pursued, with plans 
for a euro area-wide survey being prepared 
by the Eurosystem Household Finance and 122ECBAnnual Report
2007Consumption Network. Other topics analysed within this area of research were central bank 
communication policies, expectations and risk 
premia in the yield curve, and the determinants 
of equity price dynamics.Financial stability issues and their impact on 
monetary policy were also explored, particularly 

in the context of work carried out for the ECB™s 

Financial Stability Review. The Þ nancial system 
was analysed along two dimensions: its degree of 

integration and the evolution of capital markets.Under the research priority related to international issues, the main areas of interest 
were global imbalances and the international 
role of the euro. As regards the former, a high-
level seminar will be organised in 2008, while 
the outcome of work on the latter will be used 
to enhance the analytical content of the annual 
ﬁReview of the international role of the euroﬂ. 
In the context of this research priority, an 
international extension of the NAWM was 
developed.5.2 PUBLICATIONS AND CONFERENCES
The ECB™s research results were published in 
its Working Paper Series and, to some extent, 
also through the Occasional Paper Series and 
the Legal Working Paper Series. In particular, 
the Working Paper Series Œ already a well-
established tool to communicate policy-relevant 
internal research Œ saw the publication of more 
than 140 working papers in 2007. Slightly more 
than 100 were written by ECB staff, either alone 
or with external co-authors, with the remainder 
being written by external visitors attending 
conferences and workshops, working in the 
context of research networks or following a 
prolonged stay at the ECB for the completion of a 
research project. As is now the established norm, most of the papers are eventually expected to be 
published in leading, peer-reviewed academic 
journals. In 2007 ECB staff published more than 
50 articles in academic journals.In order to disseminate the Þ ndings of the 
Working Paper Series to a wider audience, it was decided to publish a Research Bulletin outlining 
policy-relevant research work, including 
topical articles and summaries of selected 
research papers. Featured articles in 2007 
included discussions of the effects of imperfect 
information and learning on Þ nancial market 
prices, Þ nancial integration and capital 
ß ows in new EU Member States, and productivity 
growth in the euro area.The ECB organised or co-organised more than 
ten conferences or workshops on research topics. 

Co-organised conferences involved the CEPR and 

other central banks, both from the Eurosystem 

and from outside the Eurosystem. Furthermore, 

a large number of workshops and seminars were 

organised to disseminate research within the ECB.Most of the conferences and workshops were related to speciÞ c research priority areas. 
The area of forecasting model development 
continued in 2007 to receive the same degree 
of attention as in previous years. In September 
a workshop co-organised by the ECB, together 
with the CEPR and the Banque de France, in 
the context of the Euro Area Business Cycle 
Network, was held to discuss changes in inß ation dynamics and their implications for forecasting. 
Conclusions from the workshop provided a 
useful input into work on inß ation forecasting 
under way at the ECB. Furthermore, a workshop 
on forecasting techniques (an event organised by 
the ECB on a biennial basis) discussed forecast 
uncertainty in macroeconomics and Þ nance, and 
more speciÞ cally how to integrate measures of 
risk into forecasting activities, a topical issue for 
many central banks.Concerning the research priority of monetary policy analysis, a conference jointly organised 
by the Bank of Canada and the ECB on the 
deÞ nition of price stability was held at the ECB 123ECBAnnual Report
2007in November 2007. The conference addressed the theoretical options and practical experience 
in the context of deÞ ning price stability. Another 
conference in November 2007 on the analysis of 
the role, challenges and implications of money 
markets from a monetary policy perspective 
further advanced the understanding of the 
transmission mechanism of monetary policy. 
A conference on the implications of changes 
in banking and the Þ nancing of 
Þ rms for the 
monetary policy transmission mechanism was 
held in May 2007.A joint conference with the Bank of England  Œ on payments and monetary and Þ nancial stability Œ was held in June 2007 as part of the 
work in the area of Þ nancial stability research, 
and a conference on globalisation and the 
macroeconomy took place in July 2007 in the 
context of the work on international issues.An additional mechanism for the dissemination of research was the organisation of seminar 
series, of which two were of particular 
relevance: the Joint Lunchtime Seminars, 
co-organised with the Deutsche Bundesbank and 
the Center for Financial Studies, and the Invited 
Speakers Seminars. The two series comprise 
weekly seminars to which external researchers 
are invited to present their recent work. The 
ECB also organises research seminars outside 
the scope of these two series on a more ad 
hoc basis.124ECBAnnual Report
20076.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITION OF 
MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED 
ACCESS 
Pursuant to Article 237(d) of the Treaty, the 
ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the 
compliance of the 27 EU NCBs and the ECB 
with the prohibitions implied by Articles 101 
and 102 of the Treaty and Council Regulations 
(EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 101 
prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from providing 
overdraft facilities or any other type of credit 
facility to governments and Community 
institutions or bodies, as well as from purchasing 
debt instruments directly from them. Article 102 
prohibits any measure, not based on prudential 
considerations, which establishes privileged 
access by governments and Community 
institutions or bodies to Þ nancial institutions. 
In parallel with the Governing Council, the 
European Commission monitors Member States™ 
compliance with the above provisions. The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ secondary market purchases of debt instruments 
issued by the domestic public sector, the public 
sector of other Member States and Community 
institutions and bodies. According to the recitals 
of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the 
acquisition of public sector debt instruments 
in the secondary market must not be used to 
circumvent the objective of Article 101 of the 
Treaty. Such purchases should not become 
a form of indirect monetary Þ nancing of the 
public sector.In 2007 the Governing Council identiÞ ed two cases of non-compliance with the above Treaty requirements and the associated Council 
Regulations. First, Národná banka Slovenska purchased debt instruments issued by the European Investment 
Bank (EIB) in the primary market. More 
speciÞ cally, on 6 February 2007 Národná banka 
Slovenska bought USD-denominated EIB bonds 
amounting to USD 50 million for the purpose 
of foreign exchange reserve management. 
Since the EIB is a Community body, such purchases constitute a breach of the monetary 
Þ nancing prohibition according to Article 101 
of the Treaty and Council Regulation (EC) 
No 3603/93. Národná banka Slovenska sold the 
EIB debt instruments purchased in the primary 
market on 22 May 2007 and took immediate 
measures to prevent the occurrence of such 
events in the future.Second, Banka Slovenije exceeded the limit 
on central bank holdings of coins which are 

credited to the public sector™s account. On 

15 February 2007 Banka Slovenije™s holdings 

of coins issued by the public sector and credited 

to the national public sector™s account exceeded, 

on a daily average basis, the limit of 10% of the 

value of coins in circulation established by Article 

6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93. 

On that date, the value of coins held by Banka 

Slovenije and credited to the public sector™s 

account reached 12.27% of the value of coins in 

circulation. This was a consequence of the strong 

return of coins to Banka Slovenije in the Þ rst half 
of February 2007, following the frontloading of 

the distribution to banks in autumn 2006 prior to 

the adoption of the euro. The situation was fully 

corrected immediately and the Treaty provisions 

have been respected since that date.6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONS
Article 105(4) of the Treaty requires that the 
ECB be consulted on any proposed Community 
or national legislation falling within its Þ elds of competence. 20  All ECB opinions are published on the ECB™s website. The ECB adopted 43 opinions in 2007:  8 were in response to consultations by the EU institutions 
and 35 were in response  to consultations by 
national authorities. This compares with 62 
consultations in 2006. A list of the opinions 
adopted in 2007 and early 2008 is annexed to this 
Annual Report. The United Kingdom is exempt from the consultation obligation, 20 pursuant to the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, annexed 
to the Treaty (OJ C 191, 29.7.1992, p. 18).6 OTHER TASKS AND ACTIVITIES
125ECBAnnual Report
2007The following ECB opinions issued at the 
request of the EU Council are particularly 

noteworthy. 
In addition to the opinions adopted under Article 105(4) of the Treaty, on 5 July 2007 the ECB 
issued an opinion 21 pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty concerning the opening of the 
Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) that drew 
up the new Lisbon Treaty 22. The ECB welcomed in particular the fact that price stability and the 
establishment of an Economic and Monetary 
Union with the euro as its currency were to be 
among the EU™s objectives and that monetary 
policy was to be expressly listed as one of the 
EU™s exclusive competences (see Section 1.2 of 
Chapter 5). On 2 August 2007, after the draft 
text of the new Treaty was unveiled, the 
President of the ECB wrote a letter to the 
Presidency of the IGC 23 with some suggestions regarding the institutional status of the ECB and 
the ESCB. Following the abrogation by the Council of 
Cyprus™s and Malta™s derogation, the ECB 

issued a single opinion 24 on the proposals of the 
European Commission for amending Regulation 

(EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro and 

Regulation (EC) No 2866/98 on the conversion 

rates between the euro and the currencies of the 

Member States adopting the euro. 25 The ECB was consulted on a proposal for a 
Council directive on the identiÞ cation and 
designation of European critical infrastructures 26, aimed at enhancing coordination in response 
to terrorist threats. The ECB noted that 
national provisions implementing the directive 
need to be compatible with central banks™ 
responsibilities for oversight of payment and 
securities settlement systems and clearing 
houses, and that duplication of work already 
undertaken by central banks in this area should 
be avoided. The ECB also emphasised that the 
list of European critical infrastructures should 
be kept conÞ dential. In an opinion on a proposal for a Council 

regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 
1338/2001 (on the protection of the euro 

against counterfeiting 27), the ECB recalled 
that criminal law may exceptionally fall within 

Community competence if necessary to ensure 

the effectiveness of Community law. The ECB 

noted that the ECB and the NCBs should in 

principle receive samples of banknotes, even 

if retained as evidence in criminal proceedings, 

and that the ECB™s own competence to ensure 

the integrity of euro banknotes under Article 

106(1) of the Treaty and Article 16 of the 

Statute of the ESCB should be more precisely 

reß ected in the proposal. On the procedures to 
be deÞ ned by the ECB and the Commission 
regarding the obligation to verify that received 

euro banknotes and coins are checked for 

authenticity, the opinion noted that these 

institutions should set the deadlines for national 

implementation. 
In its opinion on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council 
amending Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on 
European statistics, 28 the ECB welcomed the recognition of the need for close cooperation 
between the European Statistical System and 
the ESCB in the development, production 
and dissemination of European statistics, and 
the provisions regarding their exchange of 
conÞ dential data. 
In June 2007 a joint task force composed of 

representatives of the European Commission, the 

EU Council™s Secretariat and the ECB issued a 

report on the consultation of the ECB on proposed 

Community legal acts. The task force was 

established following a suggestion of the 

President of the ECB. The report aims to ensure 

that all parties speed up internal procedures so 

that the ECB may be consulted and deliver its 

opinions as early as possible in the legislative 
CON/2007/20 of 5 July 2007, OJ C 160, 13.7.2007, p. 2.21 See Section 1.2 of Chapter 5 for details.22 The letter has been published on the websites of both the IGC 23 and the ECB.CON/2007/19 of 5 July 2007, OJ C 160, 13.7.2007, p. 1.24 See Section 2 of Chapter 3.25 CON/2007/11 of 13 April 2007, OJ C 116, 26.7.2007, p. 1.26 CON/2007/42 of 17 December 2007, OJ C 27, 31.1.2008, p. 1.27 CON/2007/35 of 14 November 2007, OJ C 291, 5.12.2007, p. 1.28 126ECBAnnual Report
2007process. It recognises the obligation to consult 
the ECB on Lamfalussy Level 2 measures 29 falling within the ECB™s Þ elds of competence, 
and clariÞ es the ECB™s advisory competence in 
the Þ elds of prudential supervision and 
Þ nancial 
stability. The discussions within the task force 

have developed a shared understanding of the 

need for cooperation for the beneÞ t of the 
legislative processes of the Community as a 

whole. The report reß ects the common 
understanding of the members of the task force 

and does not formally bind their respective 

institutions. 
The ECB continued to be consulted by national 
authorities on issues pertaining to the NCBs, 

in particular on amendments to the statutes of 

the German, Greek, Hungarian and Austrian 

NCBs. 30 The ECB was also consulted by the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Portugal and Romania 

on issues that may have a bearing on the NCBs™ 

independence as members of the ESCB. 31 The ECB was consulted in the area of monetary 
policy by Latvia, Malta, Poland and Romania on 
the minimum reserves regime, 32 and by Cyprus, Poland and Slovenia with regard to currency 
matters and means of payment. 33 The ECB was also consulted by Austria, Germany, Hungary 
and Romania on statistical issues. 34 With regard to supervision, Bulgaria, Germany, 
Greece, Italy, Austria, Poland and Romania 35 consulted the ECB on draft legislative proposals 
relating to signiÞ cant reforms of the 
Þ nancial supervisory framework and to Þ nancial stability-
related issues. In this context, in its opinions 
on a draft law amending the Banking Act, the 
Savings Banking Act, the Financial Supervisory 
Authority Act and the Act of the Oesterreichische 
Nationalbank aimed at further improving the 
supervisory framework for credit institutions 
in Austria and strengthening the role of the 
NCB, the ECB restated, in line with its previous 
opinions in this area, that cooperation (including 
information-sharing) between supervisory 
authorities and central banks is essential for 
the conduct of macro-prudential monitoring, 
the oversight of payment systems and the 
safeguarding of other market infrastructures which are essential for the smooth conduct of 
monetary policy. In particular from a Þ nancial stability perspective, the ECB held the view that 
NCBs would inevitably need to be involved in 
Þ nancial market crisis management. 
In the area of payment and settlement systems, 
the ECB was consulted by the Netherlands, 
Hungary, Latvia, Greece, Slovenia, Romania, 
and Spain.36 In this Þ eld, the Dutch Ministry 
of Finance requested the ECB™s opinion on 
a draft law concerning systemic oversight of 
clearing and settlement companies. The ECB 
reiterated its view that, since payment systems 
are interlinked with securities clearing and 
settlement systems, there is a strong argument 
in favour of the NCB performing the oversight 
of both payment systems and securities clearing 
and settlement systems. It also repeated its 
recommendation that the oversight of payment 
systems, including market conduct, be explicitly 
assigned to De Nederlandsche Bank, which 
would be consistent with its participation in 
the Eurosystem. The ECB also noted that the 
NCB, as the prudential and systemic supervisor, 
should play a role in assessing whether the 
rules of the clearing and settlement institutions 
contain criteria limiting access by participants 
on grounds other than risk. With regard to the legal framework for the introduction of the euro, the ECB was consulted 
by Cyprus. 37 Slovakia consulted the ECB on draft national legislation intended to facilitate 
the future introduction of the euro and amending 
the Law on Národná banka Slovenska and The Lamfalussy approach is a four-level process for approving 29 securities, banking and insurance legislation. For more details, see the report entitled ﬁFinal report of the Committee of Wise Men

200727 other laws governing issues falling within the competence of the ECB that are relevant for 
legal convergence with the Treaty and the 
Statute of the ESCB.38As of 2008, information regarding the most 

important cases of non-compliance with the 

duty to consult the ECB on draft national and 

Community legislation is also included in the 

Annual Report. In 2007 there were six cases 

of non-consultation of the ECB. In one case of 

non-compliance, the Polish authorities failed 

to seek the views of the ECB on a draft law 

on disclosure. The law intended to impose on 

certain individuals the obligation to declare 

activities between 1944 and 1990 which 

could be deÞ ned as collaboration with the 
state security services. Certain provisions of 

the draft law could have affected central bank 

independence and amended some aspects of 

the NCB™s institutional regime under the Law 

on Narodowy Bank Polski, with implications 

for members of the governing bodies and 

staff of Narodowy Bank Polski. Had the ECB 

been consulted on this draft legislation, it 

would have raised signiÞ cant objections. The 
ECB corresponded with the Sejm Marshal 

(the speaker of the lower house of the Polish 

parliament) regarding the obligation to 

consult, but received replies disputing the 

ECB™s competence to be consulted on the 

aforementioned draft legislation. Subsequently, 

certain provisions of the law on disclosure 

that were of relevance for the ESCB were 

invalidated by the Polish Constitutional Court.In another case of non-consultation, the Latvian authorities failed to consult the ECB on a draft 
legislative provision on currency matters, 
as required by Community law. The draft 
provision in question, which was adopted on 
18 December 2007, was an amendment to the 
Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers on the 
rendering of the name of the single currency 
of the European Union in Latvian, which was 
originally adopted on 26 July 2005 and in 
relation to which the Latvian authorities also 
failed to consult the ECB. Whereas the original 
Regulation provided that the name of the single currency in Latvian was ﬁeiroﬂ, this provision 
has now been changed so that in Latvian legal 
acts the name ﬁeuroﬂ must be used. Outside 
legal acts the single currency is still ofÞ cially named ﬁeiroﬂ in Latvia. Following the adoption 
of the original Regulation in 2005, the ECB 
wrote to the Latvian Minister of Finance on 
1 September 2005, clearly indicating that, in 
accordance with the consistent case law of the 
European Court of Justice, Member States may 
not legislate on matters regulated by directly 
applicable Community law, and emphasising 
that the Community has exclusive competence 
to legislate on the euro and its name. CON/2007/43.38 128ECBAnnual Report
20076.3 ADMINISTRATION OF THE BORROWING AND 
LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITYIn accordance with Article 123(2) of the 
Treaty and Article 9 of Council Regulation 
(EC) No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002, the 
ECB continues to have responsibility for 
the administration of the borrowing and 
lending operations of the European Community 
under the Medium-Term Financial Assistance 
mechanism. In 2007 the ECB did not perform 
any administration tasks. There was no 
outstanding balance at the end of 2006 and no 
new operations were initiated during 2007. 6.4 EUROSYSTEM RESERVE MANAGEMENT 
SERVICESIn 2007 a comprehensive set of services 
continued to be offered under the framework 
established in 2005 for the management 
of Eurosystem customers™ euro-denominated 
reserve assets. The complete set of services Œ 
which is available to central banks, monetary 
authorities and government agencies located 
outside the euro area, as well as to international 
organisations Œ is offered under harmonised 
terms and conditions in line with general market 
standards by individual Eurosystem central banks 
(the Eurosystem service providers) acting as 
dedicated service providers. The ECB performs 
an overall coordination role, ensuring the smooth 
functioning of the framework. The number of 
customers maintaining a business relationship 
with the Eurosystem in 2007 remained stable 
by comparison with 2006. With respect to the 
services themselves, there was an increase in 
customers™ total cash balances and/or securities 
holdings. In 2007 the Eurosystem carried out a 
customer satisfaction survey, which conÞ rmed customers™ overall satisfaction with the range of 
services available under the framework and the 
quality of service offered.CHAPTER 3ENTRY OF CYPRUS 
AND MALTA INTO 
THE EURO AREA 
132ECBAnnual Report
2007On 10 July 2007 the ECOFIN Council adopted a 
decision allowing Cyprus and Malta to introduce 

the euro as their currency as from 1 January 2008, 

increasing the number of euro area countries 

from 13 to 15. The Council™s decision was based 

on the convergence reports published by the ECB 

and the European Commission in May 2007, and 

followed a discussion by the EU Council in the 

composition of the Heads of State or Government, 

an opinion of the European Parliament and a 

proposal from the European Commission. On 

the same day, the ECOFIN Council adopted a 

regulation Þ xing the irrevocable conversion rates 
between the Cyprus pound and the Maltese lira 

on the one hand and the euro on the other. The 

conversion rates were set at CYP 0.585274 and 

MTL 0.429300 to the euro and were identical to 

the central rates agreed with effect from 2 May 

2005, when the currencies entered ERM II. The 

Cyprus pound had remained close to its central 

rate against the euro on the strong side of the 

ß uctuation band, whereas the Maltese lira had 
stayed at its central rate during the whole period 

of participation in ERM II. Both currencies were 

trading very close to or at those rates on the day 

when the conversion rates were set.Looking back over the past ten years, HICP 

inß ation in both Cyprus and Malta has been 
relatively contained, ß uctuating mostly between 
2% and 3% (see Tables 14 and 15). These 

relatively favourable inß ation developments 
should be seen against the background of
long-standing pegged exchange rate regimes. In 

Cyprus, HICP inß ation stood at higher levels in 
2000 and 2003, largely reß ecting strong increases 
in energy and food prices, as well as the EU 

harmonisation-related gradual increases in energy 

excise taxes and in the VAT rate from 10% to 15% 

in the period 2002-03. In Malta, somewhat higher 

HICP inß ation rates were recorded in 1997 and 
1998, largely owing to relatively strong increases 

in hotel, restaurant and transport prices. In 2007 

average HICP inß ation in Cyprus stood at 2.2%, 
with annual inß ation rates rising from subdued 
levels in the Þ rst half of the year to above 3% at 
the end of 2007, mainly reß ecting the development 
of energy prices. In Malta, HICP inß ation in 
2007 was on average lower than in 2006, mainly 

reß ecting a sizeable drop in energy prices from 
the elevated levels recorded in the previous year, 

as well as a decline in accommodation prices.

2007rates rose steadily to stand at just above 3% in 
December, resulting in an average inß ation rate 
for the year as a whole of 0.7%. In both Malta and 

Cyprus, food prices contributed to rising inß ation 
in the course of 2007. In Malta, this increase 

in inß ation, which became particularly visible 
during the last quarter of the year, also reß ected 
increases in the clothing and footwear and hotel 

and restaurant sub-indices.Inß ation developments should be seen against a 
background of solid economic growth over the 
past decade in Cyprus, while growth was more 

sluggish in Malta. In Cyprus, real GDP grew by 

approximately 5% at the start of the decade, before 

moderating to around 2% in 2002 and 2003, 

reß ecting weakening tourism demand. In recent 
years, real GDP growth has picked up again 

to around 4%, in line with renewed strength in 

domestic demand. In Malta, following a period of 

solid economic growth until 2000, output growth 

slowed signiÞ cantly, re
ß ecting external weakness, 
increased competition in Malta™s export markets 

and restructuring operations in the manufacturing 

sector. Output growth picked up again in later 

years and averaged around 3%, mainly driven 
by domestic demand. As regards external 

developments, Cyprus and Malta have on average 

recorded current and capital account deÞ cits of 
around 3.5% and 4% of GDP respectively over 

the past ten years. In 2007 the current and capital 

account deÞ cit increased to 7.1% of GDP in 
Cyprus and declined to 3.2% of GDP in Malta.Labour market conditions have remained relatively stable over the past decade in both 
countries. In Cyprus, the unemployment rate 
ß uctuated between 3% and 5%, while in Malta 
it mostly hovered around 7%. Employment 
growth was relatively strong in Cyprus, rising to 
almost 4% between 2003 and 2005, whereas in 
Malta employment increased more moderately 
over this period. Following the economic 
recovery in recent years, however, conditions in 
the labour market strengthened in both countries 
in the course of 2007. Unemployment rates 
followed a declining trend in both Cyprus and 
Malta, standing at 3.9% and 5.8% respectively 
at the end of 2007. SigniÞ cant ß ows of foreign 
workers, including seasonal workers, support 
the ß exibility of the labour markets in both 
countries.Table 15 Main economic indicators for Malta(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated)1998199920002001200220032004200520062007

2007Fiscal policy has become more supportive of the achievement of price stability over recent years 
in both Cyprus and Malta as their Þ scal positions 
have improved signiÞ cantly. Starting from high 
levels, the general government deÞ cit-to-GDP ratio started to decline in both countries in 2004. 
In Cyprus, the deÞ cit ratio of 6.5% of GDP in 
2003 turned into a surplus of 1.5% in 2007, 
whereas in Malta, the deÞ cit ratio fell from 
9.8% of GDP in 2003 to 1.6% in 2007. In both 
countries, the improvement in the government™s 
budgetary situation was mainly driven by
non-cyclical factors, although temporary 
measures have also played an important role 
in recent years. The general government debt-
to-GDP ratio is high in both countries but has 
declined in recent years. In Cyprus, the debt 
ratio declined from a peak of 70.2% of GDP 
in 2004 to 60% in 2007, while in Malta, it fell 
from 72.7% of GDP to 62.9% over the same 
period. In Malta, further Þ scal consolidation 
is required if the country is to comply with its 
medium-term objective speciÞ ed in the Stability 
and Growth Pact. In addition, in both countries, 
sufÞ cient room for manoeuvre should be created 
in the public Þ nances to cope with the expected 
worsening of the demographic situation, which 
is likely to entail an increase in age-related 
public expenditure.Monetary policy played an important role in the convergence process in Cyprus and Malta. 
Both countries have a long-standing tradition 
of pegged exchange rate regimes, dating back 
to the 1960s. In addition, the maintenance 
of price stability as the primary objective of 
monetary policy was enshrined in the Central 
Bank of Cyprus Law and the Central Bank 
of Malta Act in 2002. The Cyprus pound was 
pegged to the ECU in 1992 and to the euro in 
1999, with a ß uctuation band of ±2.25%. The 
band was widened to ±15% in 2001 in the 
context of an ongoing gradual liberalisation 
of capital movements. However, the Central 
Bank of Cyprus did not make use of the wider 
band and the exchange rate moved within a 
narrow range. The Maltese lira was pegged to 
a basket of currencies for most of the period 
following Malta™s independence in 1964, with large weights being assigned to the ECU/euro, 
the pound sterling and the US dollar. As the 
euro was the currency with the largest weight 
in the basket (accounting for 70%), exchange 
rate ß uctuations of the lira vis-à-vis the euro 
remained fairly limited in the years before 
ERM II entry. Both the Cyprus pound and the 
Maltese lira entered ERM II on 2 May 2005, 
joining with the standard ß uctuation band of 
±15%. At that time, the Maltese authorities 
also stated their intention to maintain the 
exchange rate of the lira at the central rate
against the euro as a unilateral commitment. During 2007 the monetary policy of the central banks of Cyprus and Malta continued 
to be geared towards the achievement of price 
stability. Both central banks provided support 
for their exchange rate pegs by keeping their key 
ofÞ cial interest rates above those of the ECB. 
The Central Bank of Cyprus kept its minimum 
bid rate unchanged at 4.5% for most of the year, 
whereas the Central Bank of Malta increased 
its central intervention rate twice, in January 
and May, by a total of 50 basis points to 4.25%. 
The alignment of the ofÞ cial interest rates with 
those of the ECB took place on 21 December 
2007 in Cyprus and on 28 December 2007 in 
Malta, completing the process of convergence 
of ofÞ cial interest rates. Money market interest 
rates in Cyprus and Malta moved broadly in line 
with the ofÞ cial interest rates in each country, 
resulting in the completion of the convergence 
of market interest rates in December 2007. 
Long-term interest rates had already been 
close to euro area levels since early 2006. 
This reß ected market con
Þ dence in general 
economic developments in both countries and 
the credibility of their monetary and exchange 
rate policies.Following their adoption of the euro, the main policy challenge for both Cyprus and Malta is 
to ensure the conduct of appropriate national 
economic policies in order to secure a high degree 
of sustainable convergence. It is particularly 
important for both countries to continue 
on sustainable and credible paths of Þ scal consolidation based on structural measures and 135ECBAnnual Report
2007to improve their Þ scal performances by tangibly 
reducing their debt ratios. It is also important that they maintain moderate wage developments that 
take into account labour productivity growth, 
labour market conditions and developments 
in competitor countries. In both countries, the 
strengthening of competition in product markets 
and improvements in the functioning of the 
labour market are key elements in this regard. In Cyprus, for example, the indexation mechanism 
for wages and for some social beneÞ ts (such as 
cost-of-living allowances) should be overhauled 
in order to reduce the risks associated with 
inß ation inertia. In Malta, attention must also be 
paid to overcoming the structural constraints on 
economic growth and job creation, notably by 
fostering labour participation.Box 10STATISTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EURO AREA TO INCLUDE CYPRUS AND 

MALTA
The enlargement of the euro area to include Cyprus and Malta as of 1 January 2008 is the third 
occasion on which statistical series for the euro area have had to be amended in order to include 
additional member countries. The preparation of statistics for the enlarged euro area has been 
coordinated, where necessary, with the European Commission.The entry of Cyprus and Malta into the euro area means that residents of these countries have become residents of the euro area. This affects statistics for which euro area aggregates are not a 
simple sum of national data, such as monetary, balance of payments and international investment 
position statistics, as well as Þ nancial accounts, because transactions between residents of Cyprus 
and Malta and other euro area residents must now be consolidated.As of January 2008 Cyprus and Malta are thus obliged to meet all the statistical requirements of the ECB, i.e. to provide fully harmonised and comparable national data.1 Since the preparatory work for new statistics requires a long lead time, the central banks of Cyprus and Malta and 
the ECB started the statistical preparations well before Cyprus and Malta joined the EU. After 
becoming members of the ESCB, the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta 
intensiÞ ed their preparations to ful
Þ l the requirements of the ECB in the 
Þ eld of monetary, 
banking, balance of payments, government Þ nance, Þ nancial accounts and other 
Þ nancial statistics. In some statistical areas, an action plan has been developed with the two countries in 
order to ensure the gradual fulÞ lment of all ECB statistical requirements in the course of 2008. 
In addition, the central banks of Cyprus and Malta had to carry out the necessary preparations 
for the integration of Cypriot and Maltese credit institutions into the ECB™s minimum reserve 
system and to fulÞ l the relevant statistical requirements.
For the data reporters and NCBs of the other euro area countries, the enlargement of the euro 
area meant that from January 2008 they had to report transactions (or ß ows) and positions 
with residents of Cyprus and Malta as part of the euro area data, rather than as transactions and 
positions with non-euro area residents. 1 The statistical requirements of the ECB are summarised in the document ﬁECB statistics: an overviewﬂ, April 2006.
136ECBAnnual Report
2007In addition, Cyprus, Malta and the other euro area countries all had to provide backdata with 
sufÞ cient geographical and sector detail, dating back at least as far as 2004, the year Cyprus and 
Malta joined the EU.Regarding the publication of euro area statistics, the ECB has granted users online access to two sets of time series, one containing data for the current euro area (i.e. including Cyprus and Malta) 
as far back as available, and one linking the various compositions of the euro area, starting with 
the 11 countries in 1999. 137ECBAnnual Report
2007Pursuant to Article 122(2) of the Treaty, the ECB reviewed the statutes of the Central Bank 
of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta and 
other relevant Cypriot and Maltese legislation 
for compliance with Article 109 of the Treaty. 
The ECB made a favourable assessment of the 
compatibility of Cypriot and Maltese legislation 
with the Treaty and with the Statute of the 
ESCB, as stated in its Convergence Report on 
Cyprus and Malta published in May 2007. The ECB, the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta put in place a number of 
legal instruments with a view to ensuring the 
integration of the Central Bank of Cyprus and 
the Central Bank of Malta into the Eurosystem 
on 1 January 2008. The Eurosystem™s legal 
framework was adapted as a consequence of the 
decision taken by the ECOFIN Council on 
10 July 2007 to abrogate the derogations of 
Cyprus and Malta 1. The introduction of the euro in Cyprus and Malta and the integration of their 
central banks into the Eurosystem also required 
changes to some Cypriot and Maltese 
legal instruments. In March 2007 the Central Bank of Cyprus™s statutes were brought into line with 
recommendations in the ECB™s Convergence 
Reports 2004 and 2006. Cyprus had consulted 
the ECB on the draft amendments to the statutes 
of the Central Bank of Cyprus on three occasions. 
The ECB adopted three opinions proposing 
changes,2 which were reß ected in the 
Þ nal version of the statutes. In the course of 2007, the 
ECB was also consulted on amendments to other 
Cypriot legislation, governing currency issues.3Malta consulted the ECB on the draft 
amendments to the Central Bank of Malta™s 
statutes on 30 March 2006. The ECB adopted 
an opinion 4 proposing a number of changes, which were taken on board in the amendments 
to the statutes. The Central Bank of Malta 
also consulted the ECB on 21 November 2006 
on further changes to the Central Bank of 
Malta™s statutes to reß ect the recommendations 
contained in the ECB™s Convergence Report 
2006. The ECB adopted an opinion 5 on the changes, which was also reß ected in the 
Þ nal version of the Central Bank of Malta™s statutes. 
On 28 May 2007 the ECB was also consulted on 
amendments to Central Bank of Malta Directive 
No 1 on minimum reserve requirements and 
adopted an opinion on the amendments.6 The ECOFIN Council™s decision of 10 July 2007 
triggered amendments to Council Regulation 
(EC) No 974/98 to enable the introduction of the 
euro in Cyprus 7 and Malta 8, and the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 1135/2007 9 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1134/2007 10 amending Regulation (EC) No 2866/98, which 
determined the irrevocably Þ xed exchange rate 
of the euro vis-à-vis the Cyprus pound and the 
Maltese lira respectively. The Council consulted 
the ECB on proposals for both these regulations, 
on which the ECB adopted an opinion.11 The ECB was also consulted on national legislation 
regulating the euro changeover in Cyprus 
and Malta. 12 As regards legal preparations for integrating the 
Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of 
Malta into the Eurosystem, the ECB adopted the 
necessary legal instruments to provide for the 
paying-up of the remaining capital and the 
transfer by each central bank of foreign reserves Council Decision 2007/503/EC of 10 July 2007 in accordance 1 with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008, OJ L 186, 18.7.2007,

auditors of the Central Bank of Cyprus 14 and of the Central Bank of Malta 15 for the annual accounts starting from the Þ nancial year 2008. 
The ECB also reviewed its legal framework and 
introduced, where necessary, amendments 
resulting from the Eurosystem membership of 
the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central 
Bank of Malta. This included a review of 
Cypriot and Maltese legislation implementing 
the Eurosystem™s legal framework for monetary 
policy and TARGET2. Cypriot and Maltese 
counterparties were consequently able to 
participate in the Eurosystem™s open market 
operations from 2 January 2008. The ECB also 
adopted a regulation on transitional provisions 
for the application of minimum reserves by the 
ECB following the introduction of the euro in 
Cyprus and Malta.16 Finally, the ERM II agreement 17 was terminated for the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta.

2007Following the ECOFIN Council™s decision of 10 July 2007 on the adoption of the euro by 
Cyprus and Malta on 1 January 2008, the ECB 
conducted technical preparations with a view to 
fully integrating the Central Bank of Cyprus and 
the Central Bank of Malta into the Eurosystem. 
In line with the provisions of the Treaty, both 
central banks joined the Eurosystem with exactly 
the same rights and obligations as the NCBs of 
the EU Member States that had already adopted 
the euro.The technical preparations for the integration of the central banks of Cyprus and Malta into the 
Eurosystem were conducted in close cooperation 
between the ECB and the Central Bank of 
Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta and, 
where appropriate, in a multilateral manner with 
the 13 NCBs of the euro area. These preparations 
covered a wide range of areas, notably Þ nancial reporting and accounting, monetary policy 
operations, foreign reserve management and 
foreign exchange operations, payment systems, 
statistics and banknote production. In the Þ eld of operations, preparations involved extensive 
testing of the instruments and procedures for the 
implementation of monetary policy and foreign 
exchange operations. 3.1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS  
Following the adoption of the euro by Cyprus 
and Malta on 1 January 2008, credit institutions 
located in these two countries became subject 
to the Eurosystem™s reserve requirements 
as from that date. However, as 1 January 
2008 fell almost in the middle of the regular 
Eurosystem reserve maintenance period running 
from 12 December 2007 to 15 January 2008, 
transitional provisions had to be made for the 
application of minimum reserves in Cyprus 
and Malta during this maintenance period. 
Transitional provisions were also needed for the 
calculation of the reserve base of the respective 
counterparties. The list of the 215 Cypriot 
and 22 Maltese credit institutions subject to 
the Eurosystem™s reserve requirements was published on the ECB™s website for the Þ rst time 
on 31 December 2007.The entry of Cyprus and Malta into the euro area increased the aggregate reserve requirements 
of euro area credit institutions by less than 1% 
(•1.1 billion and •0.4 billion respectively). The 
autonomous liquidity factors in the balance 
sheets of the two central banks reduced the 
liquidity needs of the entire euro area banking 
sector by, on average, •2.7 billion in the period 
from 1 to 15 January 2008. In the calculation 
of this Þ gure, the liquidity-absorbing monetary 
policy operations launched by the Central Bank 
of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta before 
entering the euro area, which had all matured 
by 4 January, are also treated as autonomous 
factors. Accordingly, taking into account both 
reserve requirements and autonomous factors, 
the entry of Cyprus and Malta into the euro area 
reduced the total liquidity needs of the euro area 
banking sector by •1.2 billion, equating to 0.3% 
of the aggregate liquidity needs. In general, this liquidity surplus of •1.2 billion was smoothly channelled via the interbank 
market to banks in other euro area countries, so 
that it could be used for the fulÞ lment of reserve 
requirements in those countries. However, 
until 15 January, a daily average of around 
•0.3 billion was also placed in the deposit 
facility by Cypriot counterparties. The ECB took account of the impact on euro area liquidity conditions by adjusting the allotment 
amounts in its main reÞ nancing operations 
already as of the operation which was settled on 
28 December and matured on 4 January. Given 
the liquidity surplus, counterparties from Cyprus 
and Malta only submitted a negligible amount 
of bids in the main reÞ nancing operations at 
the beginning of 2008. However, they did 
participate in the liquidity-absorbing Þ ne-tuning operations which were conducted on 2 and 
3 January, depositing •0.3 and •0.5 billion with 
the Eurosystem. On entering the euro area, the central banks of Cyprus and Malta also adopted the collateral 3 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE INTEGRATION

INTO THE EUROSYSTEM 
140ECBAnnual Report
2007framework of the Eurosystem. The Central Bank of Cyprus reported assets of •4.2 billion 
located in Cyprus and the Central Bank of 
Malta reported assets of •3.1 billion located 
in Malta which were eligible to be used as 
collateral in Eurosystem credit operations as of 
1 January 2008.3.2 CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECB’S CAPITAL, 
RESERVES AND FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETSUpon joining the ESCB on 1 May 2004, the 
Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of 
Malta paid up 7% of their share of the subscribed 
capital of the ECB as a contribution to the ECB™s 
operational costs. In accordance with Article 49 
of the Statute of the ESCB, the Central Bank of 
Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta paid up the 
remaining part of their subscription on 1 January 
2008. Their total subscribed shares amount to 
•7.2 and •3.6 million respectively, equivalent to 
0.1249% and 0.0622% of the ECB™s subscribed 
capital of •5.761 billion as at 1 January 2008.At the beginning of 2008, in accordance with Articles 30 and 49.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central 
Bank of Malta transferred foreign reserve 
assets (of •73.4 million and •36.6 million 
respectively) to the ECB in proportion, 
based on their share in the ECB™s subscribed 
capital, to the foreign reserve assets already 
transferred to the ECB by the other euro 
area NCBs. Of the total contribution, 15% was 
made in gold and 85% in US dollar-denominated 
assets. Following the precedent set in 2007 by 
the pooling of operational activities between 
Banka Slovenije and the Banque centrale du 
Luxembourg for the management of their share 
of the ECB™s foreign reserve assets, the Central 
Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta 
have agreed to pool their operational activities 
for the management of their share of the ECB™s 
foreign reserve assets with the Bank of Greece 
and the Central Bank and Financial Services 
Authority of Ireland respectively. In connection 
with the transfer of foreign reserve assets to 
the ECB, the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta were credited with a 
euro-denominated claim on the ECB.141ECBAnnual Report
2007Six years after the successful introduction of the 
euro banknotes and coins in 12 euro area countries 

at the same time and one year after Slovenia 

joined the Eurosystem, the euro banknotes and 

coins were successfully introduced in Cyprus and 

Malta on 1 January 2008. After a dual circulation 

period of one month, the euro had fully replaced 

the Cyprus pound and the Maltese lira. 
As in the previous cash changeovers, timely and 
comprehensive preparation was crucial to the 

smooth introduction of the euro banknotes and 

coins. Both Cyprus and Malta had established 

changeover plans at the national level long 

before •-Day. These plans were based on, among 

other things, the legal framework adopted by the 

Governing Council in July 2006 in relation to 

certain preparations for the euro cash changeover 

and the frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro 

banknotes and coins outside the euro area. 
Following the ECOFIN Council™s decision of 10 July 2007 on the adoption of the euro 
in Cyprus and Malta on 1 January 2008, the 
Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank 
of Malta became eligible to borrow banknotes 
from the Eurosystem in preparation for the cash 
changeover and the banknote requirements 
in 2008. To cover the launch requirements, the Eurosystem provided the Central Bank of 
Cyprus with a total of 79.1 million euro 
banknotes with a face value of •1,730.0 million 
from its stocks, while the Central Bank of Malta 
received a total of 72.0 million banknotes with a 
face value of •1,566.0 million. For geographical 
and logistical reasons, the physical delivery of 
the banknotes was performed on behalf of the 
Eurosystem by the Bank of Greece, the Banca 
d™Italia and the Banco de Portugal. With regard to the euro coins, the competent authorities in both countries opted for a public 
tender procedure to procure the required 
quantities. In the case of Cyprus, 395.0 million 
euro coins with a face value of •100.3 million 
were produced by Mint of Finland, while the Monnaie de Paris minted 200.0 million euro coins 

with a face value of •56.1 million for Malta. 
The Central Bank of Cyprus began frontloading 
euro coins to credit institutions on 22 October 2007; 

the frontloading of euro banknotes began on 

19 November 2007. Sub-frontloading to retailers 

and the cash-operated machine industry started 

at the same time as the frontloading operation. 

A widespread predistribution of euro coins was 

supported by making some 40,000 pre-packed 

coin starter kits, worth •172 each, available to 

businesses and retailers from 3 December 2007. 

250,000 mini-kits, worth CYP 10 each, went on 

sale to the general public on the same date.In Malta the frontloading of euro coins started 
in late September 2007, while the frontloading 

of euro banknotes began in late October. The
sub-frontloading of banknotes and coins to 

businesses and retailers, including the distribution 

of coin starter kits, worth •131 each, started on 

1 December 2007. The general public was offered 

the opportunity to buy one of 330,000 mini-kits 

worth •11.65 from 10 December 2007. 
The frontloading and sub-frontloading operations in both countries, which contributed 
to a widespread distribution of euro cash before 
the launch, were completed as scheduled and 
were key to ensuring that the overall process 
ran smoothly. The changeover process in 
Cyprus and Malta also beneÞ ted from the quick conversion of the automated teller machines, 
which either had been converted before •-Day 
or were converted in the course of 1 January 
2008. In addition, retailers gave change only in 
euro cash from the Þ rst day.
In both countries the euro was brought into 
circulation under a ﬁbig bangﬂ scenario,
i.e. the euro banknotes and coins were physically 
introduced at the same time as the euro became 
legal tender. The Central Bank of Cyprus and 
the Central Bank of Malta will redeem their 
respective legacy banknotes for ten years, and 
their coins for two years. 4 THE CASH CHANGEOVER IN CYPRUS AND MALTA
142ECBAnnual Report
2007In connection with the introduction of the euro in 
Cyprus and Malta, the euro area NCBs exchanged 

Cyprus pound and Maltese lira banknotes against 

euro at par value from the Þ rst working day 
of 2008, and will continue this facility until 

29 February 2008 as a free-of-charge service.18 The amount exchanged was limited to •1,000 for 

any given party/transaction on any one day.THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON THE 

INTRODUCTION OF THE EUROThe ECB, in cooperation with the Central Bank of 
Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta, designed 
and implemented comprehensive information 
campaigns in preparation for the introduction of 
the euro in Cyprus and Malta on 1 January 2008. 
The objective of these joint euro information 
campaigns was to familiarise the public with the 
visual appearance and the security features of 
the euro banknotes and coins, as well as with the 
cash changeover modalities. Particular attention 
was paid to professional cash handlers and the 
visually impaired, for whom special training 
sessions and materials were developed.The logo ﬁ• Our moneyﬂ, which is based on the 
logo used for the information campaign for the 

introduction of the euro banknotes and coins in 

2002, featured in all the joint communication 

activities related to the changeover in Cyprus 

and Malta. 
The joint euro information campaigns adopted a communication mix involving research activities, 
publications, a press and public relations 
programme and a partnership programme, 
as well as dedicated web pages. Following 
pan-European qualitative research which was 
conducted in 2006, a strong human element 
was used when communicating about euro cash. 
Pictures of Cypriot and Maltese citizens in cash-
handling situations were used in the information 
materials in order to bring the euro closer to the 
people. The campaigns also took into account 
the lessons learnt in the context of the euro 
information campaign in Slovenia, where the 
communication mix used was validated by a 
survey conducted in February 2007.Almost 1.8 million publications, in Greek, 
Maltese, English and Turkish, were produced by the ECB and distributed by the Central Bank 

of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta. Every 

household in Cyprus and Malta received one of the 

560,000 ﬁpublic information leaß etsﬂ. Together 
with these leaß ets, households in Cyprus also 
received a euro calculator and two euro banknote 

cards, while those in Malta received two euro 

conversion cards. These are wallet-size cards 

showing two images that become alternately 

visible when the card is tilted. In Malta, the cards 

showed a conversion table for standard amounts 

in euro and Maltese lira, and on the reverse side 

the •20 banknote and its security features. In 

Cyprus, both the •20 and •50 banknote and their 

security features were shown. Special attention was paid to visually impaired citizens. The ﬁ• talking cardﬂ, an innovative 
product based on the principle of birthday cards 
which play a tune, contained an electronic 
chip with a pre-recorded three-minute message 
describing the main features of the euro and the 
local changeover modalities. Several public relations and press events triggered 
extensive press coverage: euro banners on the 

buildings of the Central Bank of Cyprus and the 

Central Bank of Malta, a euro conference in Malta 

to foster dialogue on the economic and practical 

aspects of the euro, a lecture for the academic 

world in Cyprus, and euro celebrations on 12 and 

18 January 2008 in Malta and Cyprus respectively. 

In order to provide authoritative information about 

the organisation, responsibilities and activities 

of the ECB/Eurosystem, a two-day seminar for 

Cypriot and Maltese journalists was organised at the ECB in Frankfurt in September 2007.Article 52 of the Statute of the ESCB requires that the Governing 18 Council of the ECB take the necessary measures to ensure that banknotes denominated in currencies with irrevocably Þ xed exchange rates to the euro are exchanged by the euro area NCBs 
at par value. Against this background, the Governing Council 
adopted a guideline on the exchange of such banknotes on 
24 July 2006.CHAPTER 4FINANCIAL STABILITY 
AND INTEGRATION
146ECBAnnual Report
20071 FINANCIAL STABILITY
The Eurosystem contributes to the smooth conduct of policies by the competent national 
authorities relating to the prudential supervision 
of credit institutions and the stability of the 
Þ nancial system. It also offers advice to these 
authorities and the European Commission on 
the scope and implementation of Community 
legislation in these Þ elds. 1.1 FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING 
The ECB, in collaboration with the ESCB™s 
Banking Supervision Committee (BSC), aims 
to safeguard the stability of the Þ nancial system. 1 Key activities are monitoring risks to Þ nancial stability and assessing the 
Þ nancial system™s shock-absorbing capacity. The main 
focus is on banks as they are still the primary 
intermediaries of funds and also the main 
potential channel for the propagation of risk in 
the Þ nancial system. At the same time, the 
increasing importance of Þ nancial markets and 
other Þ nancial institutions and their linkages 
with banks implies that vulnerabilities in these 
components of the Þ nancial system need to be 
monitored by the ESCB. CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTSIn 2007 the turmoil in international Þ nancial markets in the second half of the year raised a 
number of issues pertaining to Þ nancial stability 
in the euro area. The main developments, their 
dynamics and the lessons that may be drawn 
from this episode are treated elsewhere in this 
report (see Section 2 of Chapter 1), as well as in 
a number of pertinent ECB publications, notably 
the Financial Stability Review. Overall, and 
despite the turmoil, the euro area Þ nancial system 
remained sound and resilient in 2007. However, 
its shock-absorbing capacity was severely tested 
over a prolonged period during the second half 
of the year. While the macroeconomic backdrop 
remained largely supportive of Þ nancial system 
stability throughout the year, there was an 
abrupt reversal of favourable Þ nancial market 
conditions in July and August. This episode of 
Þ nancial market turbulence, which was sparked 
by a sharp rise in delinquency rates on US sub-prime mortgages, involved a repricing of credit 
risk across several markets and ultimately led to 
a disruption in the functioning of core funding 
markets. Before the market turmoil began, the euro area 
Þ nancial system was in a robust 
Þ nancial position, 
as a result of several years of strong proÞ tability 
in the banking sector which continued into the 

Þ rst half of 2007. This left the banking system 
with an ample buffer with which to absorb 

disturbances. The improvement in the proÞ tability 
of large euro area banks in the Þ rst half of 2007 
was mostly driven by strong growth in non-
interest income, whereas net interest income 

continued to come under pressure against the 

background of a ß at yield curve despite robust, 
albeit slowing, growth in loans to the private 

sector. The proÞ tability of large euro area banks 
was also supported by a continuation of low loan 

impairment charges. However, proÞ tability levels 
were adversely affected in the second half of the 

year by the repricing of credit risk and by more 

difÞ cult market conditions for funding liquidity. 
This negative impact was partly due to valuation 

changes in sub-prime and structured credit 

securities as well as leveraged loan commitments. 

The credit market turmoil had implications in 

particular for banks™ non-interest income sources, 

while banks reliant on wholesale funding sources 

also faced challenges in increasing their sources 

of net interest income. 
While continued strong proÞ tability in the 
Þ rst half of 2007 contributed positively to the capital of banks, solvency ratios decreased slightly as 
risk-weighted assets grew at a higher rate than 
banks™ capital bases. This notwithstanding, 
solvency levels remained comfortably above 
minimum regulatory requirements in the Þ rst half 
of 2007. In spite of the adverse developments 
in proÞ tability in the second half of the year, 
the direct implications of the Þ nancial market 
Since the end of 2004 the ECB has published a semi-annual 1 report on the stability of the euro area Þ nancial system entitled 
ﬁFinancial Stability Reviewﬂ. In 2007 it also published the sixth editions of the reports on ﬁEU banking sector stabilityﬂ and ﬁEU 
banking structuresﬂ. These publications present the main Þ ndings of the regular monitoring by the BSC of banking sector structure 
and stability, and are available on the ECB™s website.147ECBAnnual Report
2007turmoil are not likely to signiÞ cantly affect the 
solvency ratios of large euro area banks for 2007, indicating that these banks maintained an 
adequate shock-absorbing capacity. Aside from the possible consequences of the credit market turbulence, future risks to the 
euro area banking system mainly relate to the 
possibility of adverse developments in the credit 
cycle, with negative implications for banks™ asset 
quality and loan impairment charges. In addition, 
the possibility of a disorderly unwinding of 
global imbalances remains a source of medium-
term risk to global Þ nancial stability. 
Financial conditions in the euro area insurance 
sector continued to improve in the Þ rst half of 
2007, consolidating the improvements observed 
since 2004. This strength was supported by 
further growth in premiums, as well as by cost 
containment and moderate developments in 
losses. A strengthening of investment income, 
resulting from favourable stock market 
developments in the Þ rst half of 2007, also 
contributed to the improvement in proÞ tability. Some risks remain in the insurance sector, 
however, and may have increased. Financial 
market risks remain one of the largest risks facing 
insurers. While euro area insurance companies 
appear to have limited exposure to sub-prime 
mortgages and structured credit products, the 
secondary effects of a challenging credit market 
environment may be of some concern. Further 
risks may emerge from increased competition, 
in particular in the non-life segment of the 
insurance industry, which could put downward 
pressure on premium growth. The global hedge fund industry continued to grow in 2007 as a whole, although developments 
in net inß ows varied signi
Þ cantly throughout 
the year. Net inß ows were very strong in the 
Þ rst half of the year, notwithstanding a short-
lived episode of Þ nancial market turbulence in 
late February and early March. In the second 
half of the year, however, net investor inß ows to the hedge fund sector were adversely affected 
by the credit market turmoil and widespread 
losses in August which had an impact on all investment strategies pursued by hedge funds. 
Nevertheless, at the end of the third quarter of 
2007, year-to-date returns remained positive for 
the hedge fund industry as a whole. STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
Structural developments in the banking industry, 
which typically occur over long periods of 
time, can have important consequences for 
the stability of the Þ nancial system. In 2007 
the main long-term trends in consolidation 
and intermediation continued. The structure of 
banking markets continued to vary signiÞ cantly across EU Member States. The consolidation process, which is reß ected in 
the decrease in the number of credit institutions, continued at the aggregate level, although at a 
declining rate. At the end of 2006 the number 
of credit institutions in the EU25 was 2% 
lower than in 2005. At the same time, banking 
intermediation, measured by total banking 
assets, continued to outpace nominal GDP 
growth. The combination of a declining number 
of credit institutions and an increase in banking 
assets points to the growing importance of 
larger institutions. The reduction in the number of credit institutions was closely related to the mainly domestic merger 148ECBAnnual Report
2007and acquisition (M&A) activity within the EU banking sector. At the same time, the declining 
trend in the number of M&A transactions that 
has been observed since 2000 continued in 2007. 
Cross-border deals between credit institutions 
within the EU and those outside the EU are an 
exception to this trend, as they have increased, 
especially over the past two years. The value of 
M&As, however, increased in 2007, mainly as a 
result of large domestic deals in some Member 
States. With the acquisition of ABN Amro by 
the consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland, 
Santander and Fortis, cross-border deals in the 
EU reached a new scale. This highlights the 
predominance of a relatively small number of 
large-scale deals, which have been taking place 
every year since 2004. As regards the distribution channels used in retail banking, a number of recent developments 
can be identiÞ ed. Branch networks are being 
redesigned in terms of location and services 
in order to become more cost-effective and 
better integrated into the new distribution 
channels used by credit institutions. In addition, 
electronic channels are rapidly being developed, 
not only for the provision of information and 
transaction services but also for the promotion 
and sale of banking products. In an effort to 
address the Þ erce competition in the area of 
consumer credit, banks are also increasing 
their cooperation with third parties, such as 
retailers, Þ nancial companies and 
Þ nancial agents/services groups. These developments, 
and in particular the growing use of electronic 
channels, could involve different types of risk, 
such as operational, reputational, liquidity, 
legal and strategic risk. However, no signiÞ cant concerns for Þ nancial stability have been 
identiÞ ed to date, as electronic channels are still 
of limited importance for the majority of banks. 1.2 FINANCIAL STABILITY ARRANGEMENTS 
The main developments in the area of Þ nancial stability arrangements in 2007 concerned the 
follow-up to the Þ ndings of the EU-wide 
Þ nancial crisis simulation exercise carried out in 
April 2006. 2 The Ad Hoc Working Group on EU Financial Stability Arrangements of the 
Economic and Financial Committee (EFC), 
which was mandated to consider some of the 
key issues arising from the exercise and in which 
the ECB was represented, submitted its Þ nal report in September 2007 with a number of 
recommendations which were subsequently 
endorsed by the EFC. Throughout this 
discussion, the ECB emphasised that the 
prevention of Þ nancial crises should be the main 
focus of attention of the work, without, however, 
neglecting the pertinent issues related to the 
management of crises, if they occur, and their 
eventual resolution. As part of this endeavour, 
the BSC, in cooperation with the Committee of 
European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), 
developed a common analytical framework for 
assessing the systemic implications of a Þ nancial crisis with the aim of providing a common 
language for discussions between authorities in 
Member States affected by a cross-border 
Þ nancial crisis. This will allow the respective 
national authorities to address more effectively 
the impact of a crisis on their domestic Þ nancial systems and real economies. As a result of the EFC recommendations, the ECOFIN Council agreed in October 2007 on 
a strategic roadmap for strengthening the EU 
arrangements for Þ nancial stability at both the 
EU and the national level. As a Þ rst step, the 
Council adopted a set of common principles 
for cross-border Þ nancial crisis management 
which will be included in a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) between the central 
banks, supervisors and Þ nance ministries of the 
EU Member States to be signed in spring 2008 
as an extension of the EU MoU signed in 2005. 
The extended MoU will also include the above-
mentioned common analytical framework. In 
addition, it will contain practical guidelines 
for crisis management which reß ect a common 
This exercise was organised by the Economic and Financial 2 Committee with the aim of testing the Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in Þ nancial crisis situations 
between banking supervisors, central banks and Þ nance ministries. For more details, see the ECB™s Annual Report 2006, 
pp. 138-139.149ECBAnnual Report
2007understanding of the measures that need to be taken in the event of a cross-border crisis. The 
ECOFIN Council also encouraged the Member 
States which share Þ nancial stability concerns 
to develop and sign ﬁvoluntary speciÞ c cooperation agreementsﬂ that are consistent 
with the extended EU-wide MoU and build on 
cross-border supervisory arrangements for crisis 
prevention. The European Commission was 
invited, in close cooperation with the Member 
States, to consider possible enhancements 
and, where necessary, to propose regulatory 
changes with particular regard to information 
exchange, the cross-border transfer of assets, 
the winding-up of banking groups, and deposit 
guarantee scheme arrangements. The European 
Commission is already reviewing Directive 
2001/24/EC on the reorganisation and winding-
up of credit institutions, taking into account 
the ECB™s technical input, with the aim of 
presenting proposals in 2008 to further improve 
EU banking groups™ crisis resolution and 
management arrangements. 150ECBAnnual Report
20072 FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
2.1 GENERAL ISSUES
Ensuring the efÞ ciency and effectiveness of 
the EU regulatory and supervisory framework for Þ nancial services has been a key priority in 
recent years. The Lamfalussy framework 3 for Þ nancial regulation and supervision, established 
in the securities sector in 2002 and extended to 
the banking and insurance sectors in 2005, was 
designed to provide the appropriate institutional 
setting in this respect. The progress made towards convergence and cooperation under the Lamfalussy framework 
has been monitored closely. A Þ rst full review 
of the Lamfalussy framework for Þ nancial regulation and supervision across Þ nancial sectors was performed during the second half of 
2007, culminating with the ECOFIN Council™s 
adoption of its conclusions at its meeting on 
4 December 2007. The review beneÞ ted from 
the assessment of various EU institutions and 
fora, including the European Commission, 
the Inter-Institutional Monitoring Group, the 
Financial Services Committee (FSC) and the 
European Parliament. The Eurosystem, which 
has actively supported the Lamfalussy approach 
since its inception and has closely followed its 
development as part of its task to contribute to 
the smooth conduct of policies relating to the 
prudential supervision of credit institutions and 
the stability of the Þ nancial system, published 
its contribution on 30 November 2007. In this contribution, the Eurosystem noted that market developments Œ notably progress in 
banking integration, the increasing importance 
of EU banking groups with signiÞ cant cross-
border activities and the growing centralisation 
of business functions Œ underscored the urgency 
of enhancing cross-border convergence and 
cooperation in the supervision of EU banks. 
This would ensure the effective monitoring of 
and response to cross-border Þ nancial risks, 
while at the same time providing a streamlined 
supervisory interface and a level playing-Þ eld for market participants. If these aims are to be 
achieved, improvements are required at each 
step of the regulatory and supervisory process. The Eurosystem furthermore considers that the 
role of CEBS in the EU institutional setting 
should be enhanced and the responsibilities of 
CEBS members in fostering EU convergence 
and cooperation further stressed. At the same 
time, EU policy objectives need to be speciÞ ed more clearly. With respect to the regulatory 
framework, the Eurosystem sees a need to 
further enhance convergence in EU banking 
legislation. While the main priority in the area 
of cooperation between home and host 
supervisory authorities will be the effective 
day-to-day implementation of the enhanced 
regulatory framework provided by the Capital 
Requirements Directive (CRD) 4, further clariÞ cations should be considered. The home-
host cooperation arrangements for foreign 
branches deserve particular attention in this 
context, notably with a view to ensuring 
adequate host country involvement with regard 
to large foreign branches. In order to spur 
convergence of supervisory requirements, the 
Eurosystem highlights the importance of 
enhanced decision-making processes for CEBS, 
coupled with implementation on a ﬁcomply-or-
explainﬂ basis, and of effective supervisory 
disclosure and peer review. Finally, several 
measures to foster the convergence of 
supervisory processes have recently been 
introduced. These relate especially to the 
consistent implementation of CEBS standards 
and guidelines at the day-to-day level, 
ﬁoperational networkingﬂ within the supervisory 
colleges responsible for EU banking groups, The Lamfalussy approach is composed of four levels. At 3 Level 1, the basic principles of the legislation are laid down via the normal legislative process: a co-decision procedure involving 
the European Parliament and the EU Council, acting on a 
proposal of the European Commission. At Level 2, measures 
for the implementation of Level 1 legislation are adopted  and 
amended via fast-track procedures. Level 3 relates to the work of 
the Level 3 Committees to strengthen supervisory convergence 
and cooperation. Level 4 relates to Commission measures to 
strengthen the enforcement of EU law. For more details, see the 
ﬁFinal report of the Committee of Wise Men on the regulation 
of European securities marketsﬂ, 15 February 2001, which is 
available on the European Commission™s website. See also the 
ECB™s Annual Report 2003, p. 111.
The CRD comprises two recast Directives of 14 June 2006: 4 Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the 
business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/EC on the 
capital adequacy of investment Þ rms and credit institutions.
151ECBAnnual Report
2007the delegation of tasks and mediation among supervisors, and efforts to foster a common 
supervisory culture. The Eurosystem deems it 
important that these measures be effectively 
implemented and further developed in the 
period ahead. 2.2 BANKINGThe ECB, in cooperation with the BSC, has 
been carrying out work with regard to banks™ 
liquidity risk management. A report on liquidity 
risk management for cross-border banking 
groups in the EU was Þ nalised in the 
Þ rst quarter 
of 2007 and provided a timely contribution to 
the European Commission™s regulatory work 
in the area of liquidity risk. The report was also 
submitted to the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision and CEBS as input into their work 
on the subject. A streamlined version of the report was published in October 2007 as a special feature 
in the ECB™s ﬁEU banking structuresﬂ report. It 
focuses on issues relating to liquidity regulation 
and to developments in the organisation of 
cross-border banks™ liquidity risk management, 
as well as the potential implications for Þ nancial stability. The main Þ ndings of the report can 
be summarised as follows. First, cross-border 
banks do not perceive that the fragmentation 
of liquidity risk regulation in the EU imposes 
undue restrictions on the management of intra-
group liquidity across borders. However, banks 
indicated that other regulations related to home-
host arrangements and large exposure limits may 
pose potential obstacles to efÞ cient liquidity risk 
management. Second, while cross-border banks 
acknowledge the utility of initiatives taken 
by central banks to address problems related 
to international liquidity ß ows and the cross-
border use of collateral, they note that certain 
hurdles regarding the pooling of liquidity and 
the cross-border use of collateral may remain. 
Third, despite the remaining differences in 
the liquidity risk management of cross-border 
banks, the trend towards the centralisation of 
liquidity management policies and procedures, and the decentralisation of day-to-day 
liquidity management, was conÞ rmed. Fourth, 
sophisticated internal liquidity risk management 
approaches are still not widely employed, but 
the larger banks which have developed such 
approaches would also wish to use them for 
regulatory purposes. On the other hand, smaller 
banks currently use regulatory liquidity ratios 
also for internal management purposes. Finally, 
the shortening of the time horizon for banks™ 
payment obligations, the use of more market-
based and potentially more volatile funding 
sources and the increasing need for high-quality 
collateral were identiÞ ed as being among the 
major market developments affecting banks™ 
liquidity risk management. Looking ahead, the ECB, in cooperation with the BSC, will continue its work in this 
important area. In this context, the BSC will 
analyse current practices regarding EU banks™ 
liquidity risk stress-testing and contingency 
funding plans. Work is also under way at the ECB in relation to the potential pro-cyclical effects of the CRD. 
Under the CRD, the European Commission, in 
cooperation with the Member States, and taking 
into account the contribution of the ECB, has 
been given a mandate to periodically monitor 
whether the minimum capital requirements have 
signiÞ cant effects on the economic cycle, and 
to propose remedial measures if this is found to 
be the case. To this end, the BSC and CEBS are 
jointly developing an analytical framework for 
assessing the potential pro-cyclical impact of 
the new regulatory capital framework. 2.3 SECURITIESThe ECB contributed to the EU™s regulatory 
work in the area of securities through its 
participation in the European Securities 
Committee. The ECB also participated with 
observer status in the work of the European 
Securities Market Expert Group (ESME), 
established by the European Commission as an 
advisory body for the securities sector. 152ECBAnnual Report
2007In general, public authorities focused their attention in 2007 on the correct implementation
by Member States of both the Markets in 
Financial Instruments Directive and the 
Transparency Directive, as well as on the 
assessment of the need for further regulatory 
intervention. More speciÞ cally, the ECB actively participated 
in international and European fora in the debate on possible regulatory measures for hedge 
funds, given their increasing role in the Þ nancial system and the possible implications for Þ nancial stability. Following a report on highly leveraged 
institutions prepared by the Financial Stability 
Forum (FSF), the international consensus on the 
prevailing indirect regulatory approach, based 
on the close scrutiny of hedge funds by their 
counterparties Œ mainly banks Œ and investors, 
was conÞ rmed. The indirect approach, together 
with the pursuit of best practices by market 
participants, is fully supported by the ECB. The 
FSF is closely monitoring the implementation of 
its recommendations to supervisory authorities, 
counterparties, investors and the hedge fund 
industry, and has already reported to the G10 
governors and ministers of Þ nance on the 
progress made so far in this Þ eld. 153ECBAnnual Report
20073 FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
The Eurosystem has a keen interest in Þ nancial integration in Europe, as a well-integrated Þ nancial system enhances the smooth and 
effective transmission of monetary policy 
impulses in the euro area and has implications 
for the Eurosystem™s task of safeguarding 
Þ nancial stability. Financial integration also 
supports the efÞ cient operation and smooth 
functioning of payment and securities settlement 
systems. Furthermore, Þ nancial integration, a 
priority objective of the EU, can help to promote 
the development of the Þ nancial system, thereby 
raising the potential for economic growth. The Eurosystem distinguishes between four types of activity through which it contributes 
to enhancing European Þ nancial integration: 
i) raising awareness of and monitoring Þ nancial integration, ii) acting as a catalyst for private 
sector activities by facilitating collective 
action, iii) giving advice on the legislative and 
regulatory framework for the Þ nancial system 
and direct rule-making, and iv) providing 
central banking services that also foster Þ nancial integration. The ECB continued its activities in 
all four areas throughout 2007. RAISING AWARENESS OF AND MONITORING 

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION 
In March 2007 the ECB published a new 
annual publication entitled ﬁFinancial 
integration in Europeﬂ. The main purpose of 
this report is to contribute to the advancement 
of European Þ nancial integration and to raise 
public awareness of the Eurosystem™s role in 
supporting the Þ nancial integration process. 
The report is divided into three chapters. 
The Þ rst chapter sets out the ECB™s assessment of 
the state of Þ nancial integration in the euro area. 
This assessment is based on a set of quantitative 
indicators Œ with detailed elaborations thereof 
in a statistical annex Œ covering many important 
aspects of the Þ nancial system (such as the 
money, bond, equity and banking markets, 
as well as market infrastructures) which are 
published semi-annually on the ECB™s website 
and annually in this new report. The second 
chapter, entitled ﬁSpecial featuresﬂ, contains 
in-depth analyses of selected issues. The topics are generally chosen on the basis of their 
importance to the EU™s Þ nancial integration 
agenda and their relevance to the pursuit of the 
ECB™s tasks. The second chapter of the Þ rst report covers the following topics: monetary 
policy and Þ nancial integration, strengthening 
the EU framework for cross-border banks, 
and the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) 
initiative and its implications for Þ nancial integration. Finally, the third chapter provides 
an overview of the Eurosystem™s contribution 
over the past calendar year towards achieving 
more integrated and developed Þ nancial markets in Europe. In 2007 the ECB also continued its involvement in the Research Network on Capital Markets 
and Financial Integration in Europe, run in 
cooperation with the Center for Financial 
Studies at the University of Frankfurt am Main. 
The network continued its series of conferences 
with academics, market participants and 
policy-makers, with the active participation 
of NCBs. Its ninth conference, hosted by the 
Central Bank and Financial Services Authority 
of Ireland in Dublin on 8-9 October 2007, 
focused on ﬁAsset management, private equity 
Þ rms and international capital 
ß ows: their 
role for Þ nancial integration and ef
Þ ciencyﬂ. In the context of the network, the ECB awards 
each year Þ ve ﬁLamfalussy Fellowshipsﬂ 
to young researchers. Given that Þ nancial integration is expected to have implications for 
the development of the Þ nancial system and for 
economic growth, the ECB™s work on Þ nancial integration is closely linked to its wider analysis 
of factors supporting the adequate functioning 
of Þ nancial systems. Work in this area continued 
in 2007, with the aim of setting out a conceptual 
framework for measuring the development of 
the Þ nancial system. 
ACTING AS A CATALYST FOR PRIVATE SECTOR 

ACTIVITIES 
Progress in European Þ nancial integration 
depends to a large extent on private sector 
initiatives aiming to make use of the existing 
opportunities for cross-border business. Public 
authorities support such private efforts. 154ECBAnnual Report
2007In 2007 the Eurosystem continued its support for the SEPA initiative. The project 
implementation reached its most important 
phase in 2007, in preparation for the launch of 
the SEPA in January 2008. The Eurosystem 
strengthened its catalyst role by maintaining a 
constant dialogue with banks and other 
stakeholders and by intensifying coordination 
efforts with the European Commission. In July 
2007 the Eurosystem stated its position on all 
relevant topics in its Þ fth SEPA progress report, 
which addresses the status of and 
recommendations on SEPA instruments and 
infrastructures, presents the Eurosystem™s views 
on the implementation measures and migration 
towards the SEPA, and deals with the legal 
framework for the SEPA and the governance of 
the related schemes and frameworks. The 
Eurosystem worked very closely with the 
European Commission, especially in supporting 
the adoption of the Payment Services Directive 
(PSD) 5, which was approved by the European Parliament on 24 April 2007 and by the EU 
Council on 15 October 2007. The ECB and the 
Commission issued a joint statement welcoming 
the adoption of the PSD as a decisive step 
towards the realisation of the SEPA. With regard 
to the SEPA implementation process, the NCBs 
are directly involved in the work of the national 
bodies responsible for migration to the SEPA. 
At the European level, the ECB provided an 
analytical framework which allowed 
comparisons between national implementation 
plans. The Eurosystem hosted several fora to 
facilitate an open dialogue with banks, users and 
infrastructure providers, and supported similar 
initiatives by banks and the European 
Commission. The Eurosystem provided 
information to all stakeholders in brochures and 
on the websites of the ECB and the NCBs, and 
is hosting a link directory which brings together 
SEPA-related information. Euro card schemes operating in Europe have needed to comply with the SEPA cards 
framework since the beginning of 2008, and 
the SEPA credit transfer was launched on 
28 January 2008. To mark this important 
milestone, the ECB, the European Commission and the European Payments Council organised 
a high-level SEPA launch event for SEPA 
stakeholders and the media on 28 January. The ECB has supported the Short-Term European 
Paper (STEP) initiative since its inception in 

2001. Following the successful launch of the 

STEP market in July 2006, the Eurosystem 

has continued to contribute to the initiative in 

two main areas. First, the ECB and nine euro 

area NCBs will continue to provide technical 

assistance to the STEP Secretariat in the STEP 

labelling process until June 2008. However, 

the ultimate responsibility for granting and 

withdrawing the STEP label rests with the STEP 

Secretariat. Second, the ECB regularly publishes 

statistics on yields and volumes in the STEP 

market on its website. The STEP statistics are 

expected to play an important role in fostering 

the integration of this market by contributing to 

greater transparency. Since September 2006 the 

ECB has published STEP statistics on monthly 

outstanding amounts, and since April 2007 it has 

released STEP statistics on yields on a daily basis 

for selected data providers. It is planned to publish 

daily statistics for all data providers from 2008. 
ADVICE ON THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY 

FRAMEWORK FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND 

DIRECT RULE-MAKINGThe Eurosystem regularly contributes to the 
development of the EU legislative and regulatory 
framework by providing advice on the main 
policy developments and initiatives under way. Activity with regard to the EU framework for Þ nancial supervision focused in 2007 on 
the broad-based review of the Lamfalussy 
framework, to which the Eurosystem contributed 
(see Section 2 of this chapter). Furthermore, 
as part of its advisory role in accordance with 
Article 105(4) of the Treaty, the ECB regularly 
provides advice on Commission proposals for 
Level 2 legislation (see also Section 2). Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the 5 Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 
2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC 
(OJ L 319, 5.12.2007, p. 1). 155ECBAnnual Report
2007The ECB continued its work on the integration 
of European mortgage markets, following the 

Eurosystem™s contribution at the end of 2005 

to the European Commission™s Green Paper 

on this subject. The ECB pays close attention 

to the further integration and development of 

mortgage markets for several reasons. 

Mortgage markets are relevant for the 

transmission of monetary policy in the euro 

area and can have important implications for 

Þ nancial stability. In addition, mortgage 
securities play a role in the implementation of 

monetary policy via the Eurosystem™s 

framework for eligible collateral. Following 

its Green Paper consultation, the European 

Commission published a White Paper on 

18 December 2007. The ECB contributes to 

work in this Þ eld through its participation in 
various Commission expert groups and the 

European Financial Markets Lawyers Group 

(EFMLG). On 7 May 2007 the EFMLG 

published a report on legal obstacles to cross-
border securitisation in the EU. 6 The ECB provided advisory input on issues 

related to the integration of securities 

settlement systems and of payment systems. 

In particular, the ECB was closely involved in 

the work relating to the ﬁCode of Conduct for 

Clearing and Settlementﬂ. The code essentially 

aims to allow users to choose freely their 

preferred service provider at each stage along 

the transaction chain. To this end, the code 

contains commitments in three areas: price 

transparency; access and interoperability; and 
service unbundling and accounting separation. 

Given that the code is a self-regulatory tool, a 

strict monitoring mechanism has been set up to 

ensure that all the measures are implemented 

properly and on time. In principle, the 

mechanism relies on external auditors and 

an ad hoc Monitoring Group composed of 

the European Commission, the Committee 

of European Securities Regulators and the 

ECB. As the code of conduct ultimately aims 

to establish freedom of choice, it needs to 

be complemented by the full removal of the 

ﬁGiovannini barriersﬂ to efÞ cient clearing 
and settlement (named after the group that 

identiÞ ed them in 2001), which result from 
differences in technical standards and business 

practices, legal uncertainty, and differences 

in tax procedures. The removal of the Þ rst 
set of barriers is addressed within the context 

of the Clearing and Settlement Advisory 

Monitoring Expert Group (CESAME). The 

Þ scal barriers are being addressed by the 
Fiscal Compliance Expert Group, while the 

Legal Certainty Group is working on the legal 

barriers. The ECB continued to participate 

in CESAME and the Legal Certainty Group. 

Finally, the ECB continued to contribute to 

several strands of work that are being pursued 

in this Þ eld on a global level (e.g. by Unidroit), 
with a view to ensuring that EU initiatives in 

the area of securities clearing and settlement 

both complement and are consistent with the 

approaches developed by international bodies.

2007Article 65(1) of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive requires the European 
Commission to submit a review to the 
European Parliament and the EU Council on 
the possible extension of the transparency 
provisions set out in the Directive to Þ nancial instruments other than equities, in particular 
to bonds. Market participants and regulators 
have extensively debated the implications of 
enhanced trading transparency for non-equity 
Þ nancial instruments, especially corporate 
bonds. The ECB is of the view that there is no 
Þ rm evidence that the limited transparency in 
the bond market after trades have been executed 
is currently causing any market failure. At 
the same time, there is no evidence either that 
such limited transparency means an efÞ cient market functioning. The ECB suggested, at the 
Commission™s public hearing on 11 September 
2007 and at meetings of the ESME during 
2007, that this lack of experience in Europe 
be addressed via a market-led controlled 
experiment in both retail and wholesale markets 
to assess the effect of gradually introducing 
post-trade transparency into the markets for 
certain bonds. PROVIDING CENTRAL BANKING SERVICES THAT 

FOSTER FINANCIAL INTEGRATIONThe successful launch of TARGET2 on 

19 November 2007 gave further impetus to 

the process of Þ nancial integration in Europe. 
TARGET2 introduces a single technical 

infrastructure which permits the provision 

of a harmonised service level and ensures a 

level playing-Þ eld for banks across Europe. A 
single price structure applies to both domestic 

and cross-border transactions. TARGET2 also 

provides a harmonised set of cash settlement 

services in central bank money for all ancillary 

systems. The new functionalities of TARGET2 

enable banks with multinational operations to 

consolidate their internal processes, such as 

treasury and back ofÞ ce functions, and to further 
integrate their euro liquidity management. 

In addition, TARGET2 users have uniform 

access to comprehensive online information 

and liquidity control measures (see Section 2.2
of Chapter 2). 
Furthermore, with a view to reaping the 
full beneÞ ts of TARGET2, the Eurosystem 
continued to explore, in close cooperation with 
market participants, the possibility of offering a 
new service, called TARGET2-Securities (T2S), 
to provide a common technical infrastructure 
for the euro settlement of securities transactions 
in central bank money by central securities 
depositories and to process both securities and 
cash settlements on a single technical platform 
(see Section 2.3 of Chapter 2). Finally, in the area of collateral management, a single shareable platform (CCBM2) will be 
developed in parallel, and in close cooperation 
with market participants (see Section 2.4
of Chapter 2). 157ECBAnnual Report
20074 OVERSIGHT OF MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES
Payment systems oversight is one of the Eurosystem™s main tasks. By overseeing 
payment systems, in particular those that are 
systemically important 7, the Eurosystem contributes to the safety and efÞ ciency of 
Þ nancial infrastructures and, consequently, to 
the efÞ ciency of payment 
ß ows for goods, 
services and Þ nancial assets in the economy. 
The close relationship between payment systems 
and securities clearing and settlement systems 
means that central banks in general and the 
Eurosystem in particular also take a strong 
interest in securities clearing and settlement. 
The overall aim pursued by the Eurosystem is to 
minimise systemic risk. It is essential that, in their endeavours to promote the soundness and efÞ ciency of 
payment and securities clearing and settlement 
systems, central banks have comprehensive 
information on these systems at their disposal. 
For this reason, the ECB publishes, every few 
years, a comprehensive description of the main 
payment and securities settlement systems in the 
EU Member States. The fourth edition of this 
report, which has become known as the ﬁBlue 
Bookﬂ, was published on 14 August 2007. The ECB also publishes on an annual basis statistical data on payments and securities 
trading, clearing and settlement. In the past, 
these statistics were published in an addendum 
to the ﬁBlue Bookﬂ. As of the publication of the 
data for 2006 on 16 November 2007, the hard 
copy publication of the Blue Book Addendum 
has been discontinued, as the full time series 
for these data can now be downloaded from 
the ECB™s website through the Statistical Data 
Warehouse at http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/. 4.1 OVERSIGHT OF LARGE-VALUE EURO 
PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURES 
The Eurosystem oversees all major payment 
systems and infrastructures which process 
and/or settle euro transactions, including 
those managed by the Eurosystem itself. 
The Eurosystem applies the same oversight standards to both its own systems and those 
that are privately operated. These standards 
are the Core Principles for Systemically 
Important Payment Systems, deÞ ned by the 
G10 Committee on Payment and Settlement 
Systems (CPSS) and adopted by the Governing 
Council in 2001. They are complemented by the 
business continuity oversight expectations for 
systemically important payment systems (SIPS) 
which were adopted by the Governing Council 
in 2006. Based on the Core Principles and the business continuity oversight expectations, the 
Eurosystem in 2007 developed a common 
methodology for the oversight assessment of 
systemically and prominently important euro 
payment systems. The common methodology 
aims to provide the Eurosystem™s payment 
systems overseers with clear and comprehensive 
guidelines for the assessment of the relevant 
systems and the preparation of oversight 
reports. In addition, it provides payment system 
designers and operators with greater insight 
into overseers™ safety and efÞ ciency concerns, 
gives operators additional incentives to continue 
their efforts to mitigate or limit the various 
risks their systems may face and, ultimately, 
helps to ensure the smooth functioning of their 
systems. Following a public consultation on the 
common oversight assessment methodology, 
the Þ nal versions of the ﬁTerms of reference for 
the oversight assessment of euro systemically 
and prominently important payment systems 
against the Core Principlesﬂ 8 and the ﬁGuide for the assessment against the business continuity 
oversight expectations for SIPSﬂ were published 
on 12 November 2007.The Eurosystem must retain ultimate control over the euro. Therefore, from both a general A payment system is considered systemically important if a 7 disruption within it could trigger or transmit further disruptions among participants and, ultimately, in the wider Þ nancial system.
A payment system is considered prominently important if it 8 plays a prominent role in the processing and settlement of retail 
payments and its failure could have major economic effects and 
undermine the conÞ dence of the public in payment systems and 
in the currency in general.158ECBAnnual Report
2007policy and a systemic risk perspective, the Eurosystem cannot, as a matter of principle, 
allow payment infrastructures for euro 
transactions which are located outside the euro 
area to have the potential to develop into major 
euro payment infrastructures, particularly if this 
would put at risk the Eurosystem™s control over 
the euro. On 19 July 2007 the ECB published 
the ﬁEurosystem policy principles on the 
location and operation of infrastructures settling 
euro-denominated payment transactionsﬂ. These 
principles do not constitute a new policy stance 
but further detail the position of the Eurosystem 
which was outlined in 1998 in the policy 
statement on euro payment and settlement 
systems located outside the euro area and in 
2001 in the Eurosystem™s policy line with regard 
to consolidation in central counterparty clearing. 
The principles apply to any existing or potential 
payment infrastructure located outside the euro 
area that settles euro transactions.TARGET 
In accordance with the common TARGET 
oversight framework and objectives, the ECB 
and the NCBs perform regular and change-driven 
oversight activities with regard to the national
real-time gross settlement systems which 
participate in or are connected to TARGET, 
as well as with regard to the ECB payment 
mechanism (EPM). In view of the implementation 
of TARGET2 in November 2007, changes in 
TARGET were of a very limited nature, and 
the oversight of TARGET thus focused on 
regular activities, such as incident reporting and
follow-up. Before going live on 19 November 2007, TARGET2 was subject to a comprehensive 
oversight assessment which concluded in the 
third quarter of 2007. There were a number of 
oversight Þ ndings with regard to individual Core 
Principles. These Þ ndings will be addressed 
on the basis of an action plan established by 
the TARGET2 operators and agreed with the 
overseers. However, it will only be possible 
to further explore certain aspects when initial 
experience has been gained with TARGET2 
in operation. In line with existing Eurosystem policies, it is intended that the oversight 
assessment of TARGET2 will be published in 
the course of 2008. EURO1 
EURO1 is the largest privately operated payment 
system for euro credit transfers operating in 
the euro area. It is operated by the clearing 
company of the Euro Banking Association, EBA 
CLEARING. EURO1 works on a multilateral 
net basis. The end-of-day positions of EURO1 
participants are ultimately settled in central 
bank money via the TARGET system. As no 
major changes took place in the EURO1 system 
in 2007, the ECB™s oversight activities focused 
on monitoring the regular functioning of the 
system. The ECB concluded that there were no 
issues during 2007 which adversely affected the 
EURO1 system™s continued compliance with 
the Core Principles. CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM 
The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system 
was set up in 2002 to provide settlement services 
for foreign exchange transactions in multiple 
currencies. CLS currently settles in 15 major 
currencies around the world. Run by CLS 
Bank International (ﬁCLS Bankﬂ), the system 
virtually eliminates foreign exchange settlement 
risk by settling the two currency legs involved 
in foreign exchange trades simultaneously,
i.e. on a payment-versus-payment (PvP) basis, 
and only when sufÞ cient funds are available. 
CLS is regulated by the Federal Reserve 
System, which is also its lead overseer since 
CLS Bank is located in the United States. The 
Federal Reserve System cooperates with the 
central banks of all currencies which are eligible 
for CLS settlement, including the ECB. Within 
this cooperative oversight arrangement, the 
ECB (in close cooperation with the euro area 
NCBs) is the lead overseer for the settlement of 
euro transactions. In 2007 CLS prepared a self-
assessment on the basis of the Core Principles. In 2007 CLS Bank was granted regulatory approval by the Federal Reserve System to extend 
its services to the settlement of single currency 159ECBAnnual Report
2007(non-PvP) payment instructions associated with non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) and to act as 
the central settlement provider for all payment 
instructions associated with over-the-counter 
(OTC) credit derivatives calculated or matched 
by the DTCC Deriv/SERV Trade Information 
Warehouse. The Eurosystem agreed that CLS 
Bank could include the settlement of NDFs and 
OTC credit derivatives in euro as part of this 
service in view of the continued compliance of 
the CLS system with both the Core Principles 
and the Eurosystem policy principles on the 
location and operation of infrastructures settling 
euro-denominated payment transactions. The continuous safety and efÞ ciency of CLS 
and its compliance with the Eurosystem policy principles are of prime importance to the 
Eurosystem, because the CLS system is, in 
terms of value, the largest payment system 
settling euro transactions outside the euro area. 
In December 2007 CLS settled an average of 
381,436 foreign exchange transactions per day 
with an average daily settlement value equivalent 
to •2.9 trillion.9 With a share of 20% of all transactions settled in CLS, the euro has 
continued to be the second most important 
currency for settlement, after the US dollar 
(45%). The average daily value of CLS 
transactions settled in euro was •564 billion. In 2007 the BIS published a consultative report entitled ﬁProgress in reducing foreign exchange 
settlement riskﬂ to which the Eurosystem 
contributed. The report presents the results of a 
survey among major foreign exchange market 
participants on the size, duration, concentration 
and control of foreign exchange settlement 
exposures, which was conducted in 2006 by 
the central banks whose currencies are settled 
in CLS. The report indicates that further action 
is needed by individual institutions, industry 
groups and central banks to address the system-
wide risks to Þ nancial stability posed by foreign 
exchange settlement exposures. The Þ nal version of the report will be published in 2008. BUSINESS CONTINUITY 
At the ECB conference on business continuity 
for market infrastructures, held in September 
2006, market participants requested that the 
Eurosystem/ESCB organise business continuity 
exercises at the cross-border and cross-system 
level. As a follow-up, the Eurosystem/ESCB 
developed a framework and methodology for the 
organisation of business continuity exercises and 
conducted Þ rst internal crisis communication 
tests in 2007. More complex business continuity 
exercises are foreseen for 2008. In addition, the 
ESCB has worked on developing a proposal 
on how EU central banks can share public 
information concerning business continuity 
with market participants, and how central 
banks can exchange conÞ dential information 
with one another. In this context, the ESCB 
conducted a number of fact-Þ nding exercises 
to collect information on a variety of issues, 
such as international and national standards 
and initiatives, and national business continuity 
exercises. Non-conÞ dential information will 
be made available to the public on a dedicated 
business continuity area of the website of each 
central bank. The ECB is expected to make this 
dedicated area available on its website in 2008. SWIFT 
The oversight of SWIFT focuses on the 
objectives of security, operational reliability, 
business continuity and resilience of the SWIFT 
infrastructure. To ascertain whether SWIFT is 
pursuing these objectives, overseers regularly 
assess whether it has put in place appropriate 
governance arrangements, structures, processes, 
risk management procedures and controls to 
enable it to effectively manage the potential 
risks it may pose to Þ nancial stability and to 
the soundness of Þ nancial infrastructures. In the 
context of its participation in the cooperative 
oversight of SWIFT, the ECB started working The cash settlement of each foreign exchange trade consists of 9 two payment transactions, one in each currency involved. Thus, in December 2007 CLS settled 190,718 trades with an average 
daily value equivalent to around •1.5 trillion.160ECBAnnual Report
2007with the G10 central banks in 2006 to establish a set of high-level oversight expectations that 
would be suitable for the assessment of SWIFT, 
taking into consideration SWIFT™s existing 
structure, processes, controls and procedures. 
The Þ ve oversight expectations were 
Þ nalised in June 2007 and integrated into the oversight 
group™s risk-based oversight methodology. They 
are as follows:  1 Risk identi
Þ cation and management: 
SWIFT is expected to identify and manage operational and Þ nancial risks to its critical 
services and ensure that its risk management 
processes are effective. 2 Information security: SWIFT is expected 
to implement appropriate policies and 
procedures, and to devote sufÞ cient resources, to ensure the conÞ dentiality and 
integrity of information and the availability 
of its critical services. 3 Reliability and resilience: Commensurate 
with its role in the global Þ nancial system, 
SWIFT is expected to implement appropriate 
policies and procedures, and devote 
sufÞ cient resources, to ensure that its critical 
services are available, reliable and resilient 
and that business continuity management 
and disaster recovery plans support the 
timely resumption of its critical services in 
the event of an outage. 4 Technology planning: SWIFT is expected to 
have in place robust methods to plan for the 
entire life cycle of the use of technologies 
and the selection of technological standards. 5 Communication with users: SWIFT is 
expected to be transparent to its users and to 
provide them information that is sufÞ cient to 
enable users  to understand well their roles 
and responsibilities in managing risks related 
to their use of SWIFT. SWIFT is Þ nalising a self-assessment on the 
basis of these high-level expectations and 
will report to the central banks on its ability to meet the overseers™ expectations. The Þ ve expectations provide a framework within which 
the overseers organise their activities and on the 
basis of which risk-based oversight planning is 
prepared. The high-level expectations and the 
rationale for the framework were presented in 
detail in the ﬁFinancial stability reviewﬂ of the 
Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale 
de Belgique, published in June 2007. 4.2 RETAIL PAYMENT SERVICES
The Eurosystem™s oversight also covers retail 
payment systems and instruments. In 2007 
the ECB continued to monitor the smooth 
functioning of the Þ rst pan-European automated 
clearing house for bulk payments in euro, 
STEP2, which is managed and operated by EBA 
CLEARING. In the context of monitoring developments in the retail payments industry, the ECB carried out a 
comparative study together with the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City on the role of non-
banks in retail payments in the United States 
and in some European countries. 4.3 CARD PAYMENT SCHEMES
In line with its statutory responsibility to 
promote the smooth functioning of payment 
systems in the euro area, the Eurosystem has 
developed an oversight framework for card 
payment schemes which process euro payments. 
Its aim is to contribute to the maintenance 
of public conÞ dence in card payments and 
to promote a level playing-Þ eld for all card 
schemes operating across the euro area.A public consultation was conducted on the 
basis of a report entitled ﬁDraft oversight 

framework for card payment schemes Œ 

requirementsﬂ. A revised version of that 

report was then produced, taking into account 

the comments received during the public 

consultation. The report deÞ nes the intended 
scope of oversight activities to be performed 
161ECBAnnual Report
2007by the Eurosystem vis-à-vis card payment 
schemes and proposes standards which, if 

observed, would contribute to the soundness 

of such schemes. Those standards are based on 

a risk analysis conducted by the Eurosystem. 

The framework will apply to all card payment 

schemes providing services involving either 

debit or credit cards.The Þ nal version of the Eurosystem™s oversight 
standards for card payment schemes was approved by the Governing Council in January 
2008 and will be implemented in the course
of 2008.4.4 SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT
The Eurosystem has a strong interest in the 
smooth functioning of securities clearing and 
settlement systems because failures in the 
clearing, settlement and custody of collateral 
could jeopardise the implementation of 
monetary policy, the smooth functioning of 
payment systems and the maintenance of 
Þ nancial stability.
In its capacity as a user of securities settlement 
systems (SSSs), the Eurosystem assesses the 
compliance of SSSs in the euro area, as well as 
links between those SSSs, with the ﬁStandards 
for the use of EU securities settlement systems 
in ESCB credit operationsﬂ (known as the 
ﬁEurosystem user standardsﬂ). 10Links become eligible for Eurosystem credit 
operations if they fulÞ l the Eurosystem™s nine 
user standards. The Eurosystem assesses any 
new links or updates of eligible links against 
these standards. In 2007 three existing eligible 
links were updated and positively assessed. 
In addition, the use of Þ ve relayed links,
i.e. where more than two SSSs are involved, was 
assessed. No speciÞ c risks were identi
Þ ed in the 
course of this assessment. Consequently, the 
Governing Council considered all Þ ve assessed 
relayed links to be eligible to participate in the 
collateralisation process of the Eurosystem™s 
credit operations.In preparation for the entry of Cyprus and 
Malta into the euro area on 1 January 2008, the 
Governing Council assessed the SSSs of the 
two countries. The detailed analysis revealed 
that both systems were broadly compliant with 
the user standards and thus eligible for use in 
Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit 
operations.In March 2007 the CPSS published a report entitled ﬁNew developments in clearing and 
settlement arrangements for OTC derivativesﬂ 
to which the ECB contributed. The report, for 
which a series of interviews was conducted 
with banks, analysed the following six issues: 
the risks created by backlogs in documenting 
and conÞ rming trades, the implications of the 
use of collateral to mitigate credit risk, the use 
of central counterparties to reduce counterparty 
risk, the risks involved in prime brokerage, 
the risks stemming from invalid novations of 
contracts and the potential for market disruption 
from closeout following the default of one or 
more large counterparties.DEVELOPMENT OF THE STANDARDS FOR 

SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT IN THE 

EUROPEAN UNIONThe Governing Council approved a framework 
for cooperation on securities clearing and 
settlement systems between the ESCB and 
CESR in 2001. An ESCB-CESR working group 
drew up a draft report on ﬁStandards for 
securities clearing and settlement in the 
European Unionﬂ in 2004, with the aim of 
adapting the CPSS-IOSCO recommendations 
for SSSs to the EU environment. In the following 
year the working group continued to work in 
this Þ eld in order to develop an ﬁassessment 
methodologyﬂ which would provide guidance 
on the effective implementation of the standards. 
During this period the group worked in parallel 
on the adaptation of the CPSS-IOSCO 
recommendations for central counterparties. 
A number of open issues have stalled progress 
since late 2005. However, the European ﬁStandards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in 10 ESCB credit operationsﬂ, January 1998.162ECBAnnual Report
2007Commission provided new impetus in 2007 in discussions at meetings of the ECOFIN Council, 
the EFC and the FSC. Following those 
discussions, the ECOFIN Council recognised 
ﬁthat the investor protection and prudential 
safety of the post-trading sector, including its 
risk-management aspects, are important issues 
to be discussed and that concrete action, 
including for example by agreeing on the 
standards or regulatory measures, should be 
considered as a complement for the Code of 
Conduct on risks and Þ nancial stabilityﬂ. 
Furthermore, the ECOFIN Council requested 
that the FSC ﬁdeepen its work on the scope, 
legal basis and contents of the standards giving 
due consideration to the importance of ensuring 
a level playing-Þ eld; and together with the 
Commission propose ways forward on this 
subject to be submitted to the Council in early 
spring 2008ﬂ. 11 The ECB has been contributing to this work.ECOFIN Council Conclusions on Clearing and Settlement, 11 2822nd Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting, Luxembourg, 9 October 2007.CHAPTER 5 
EUROPEAN AND 
INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS
166ECBAnnual Report
2007In 2007 the ECB continued to have regular contacts with European institutions and fora, 
particularly with the European Parliament, 
the ECOFIN Council, the Eurogroup and 
the European Commission (see Chapter 6). 
The President of the ECB participated in 
meetings of the ECOFIN Council when matters 
relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB 
were discussed, as well as in the meetings of the 
Eurogroup. The President of the Eurogroup and 
the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary 
Affairs attended meetings of the Governing 
Council when they deemed it appropriate.I.I POLICY ISSUES
THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACTIn 2007 the favourable macroeconomic environment supported the improvement of 
budget balances in most countries and hence the 
abrogation of excessive deÞ cit procedures in a 
number of cases. The number of Member States 
in excessive deÞ cit decreased from eleven at the end of 2006 to six by the end of 2007. In January 
2007 the ECOFIN Council brought the excessive 
deÞ cit procedure against France to an end. It took 
the same step for Germany, Greece and Malta in 
June 2007. For the latter country, this removed a 
major obstacle to the adoption of the euro in 2008. 
Finally, in October 2007 the ECOFIN Council 
abrogated the excessive deÞ cit procedure against 
the United Kingdom. Following the correction 
of the excessive deÞ cits, it is now essential 
that Member States continue their structural 
Þ scal consolidation in line with the provisions 
of the Stability and Growth Pact to reach their 
medium-term objective. This will also help to 
prevent the 3% of GDP deÞ cit reference value 
from being breached again as a result of normal 
cyclical variations in economic activity. Two 
euro area countries (Italy and Portugal) and four 
non-euro area countries (the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) were still subject 
to ongoing excessive deÞ cit procedures at the 
end of 2007. Fiscal developments in the Czech Republic were a cause for concern. In July 2007 the ECOFIN 
Council decided, upon a recommendation by the European Commission, that the actions 
taken by the Czech Republic were proving 
inadequate to bring its deÞ cit below the 3% 
threshold by 2008. In particular, the updated 
convergence programme of the Czech Republic 
of March indicated that the 3% of GDP deÞ cit threshold would be exceeded not only in 2008, 
but also in 2009. In October 2007 the Council 
again recommended under Article 104(7) of the 
Treaty that the Czech Republic bring the deÞ cit below 3% of GDP by 2008 at the latest, with 
a 0.75% structural improvement in the budget 
balance between 2007 and 2008. According 
to the European Commission™s autumn 2007 
forecast, the deÞ cit will indeed decline to below 
3% of GDP in 2008.No further steps were taken regarding the excessive deÞ cit procedures against Italy 
(which, according to the ECOFIN Council™s 
recommendation, should have corrected its 
excessive deÞ cit by 2007), Hungary (2009), 
Poland (2007), Portugal (2008) and Slovakia 
(2007) as, in general, new data and projections 
pointed to progress in the correction of 
excessive deÞ cits in line with the Council™s 
latest recommendations. In October 2007 the ECOFIN Council 
discussed the effectiveness of the preventive 

arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, based 

on proposals from the European Commission 

included in its communication accompanying 

the report entitled ﬁPublic Þ nances in 
EMU Œ 2007ﬂ. Ministers concluded that all 

countries which had not yet reached their 

medium-term objective should speed up 

the pace of deÞ cit and debt reduction and 
allocate higher than expected revenues to this 

objective. They also reiterated the importance 

of national rules-based multi-annual
Þ scal frameworks and appropriate involvement 
of national parliaments. Moreover, Member 

States were asked to specify in their stability and 

convergence programmes how their medium-
term objectives would be met, including 

information on the extent to which further 

measures are required to achieve them. The 

Commission was requested to work further on 
1 EUROPEAN ISSUES
167ECBAnnual Report
2007the measurement of underlying Þ scal positions. 
With regard to the long-term sustainability 
of public Þ nances, the ECOFIN Council 
invited the Commission to provide proposals 

for discussion in 2008 on how to include the 

ageing-induced Þ scal burden in the de
Þ nition 
of the medium-term objectives. 
THE LISBON STRATEGY 
The Lisbon strategy Œ the EU™s wide-ranging 

programme of economic, social and 

environmental reform Œ continued to be at the 

centre of the EU economic policy debate. The 

EU Council left unchanged the Integrated 

Guidelines that were adopted in 2005 for a 

three-year period, while calling for a greater 

focus on the implementation of the strategy 

in order to achieve the overall goal of higher 

growth and more jobs. 1 At the same time, in 
spring 2007 the EU Council complemented 

these guidelines with country-speciÞ c recommendations for each Member State, and 

with a horizontal guideline addressed to euro 

area countries. Member States submitted in 

autumn 2007 their second progress reports on 

their 2005-08 national reform programmes. 

These reports set out the progress Member 

States have made so far in implementing their 

structural reform strategies. These strategies 

include ensuring the sustainability and quality 

of public Þ nances, improving the regulatory 
environment of businesses, investing in 

research and development and innovation, and 

taking measures to boost labour participation 

and enhance labour market ß exibility (see also 
Chapter 1). The progress reports on the 

national reform programmes were assessed by 

the ECOFIN Council, as well as by the 

European Commission, which published a 

ﬁStrategic reportﬂ in December 2007. These 

assessments prepared the ground for the 

adoption of a new set of integrated guidelines 

in 2008 for the new three-year policy cycle 

2008-10. At the same time, the Community 

Lisbon programme, which was updated at the 

end of 2007, set out a number of key priorities 

for Community-level action for the period 

2008-10, in line with the four priority areas of 

reform identiÞ ed by the Spring 2006 European 
Council (knowledge and innovation, business 

potential, labour markets, and energy). 
The ECB has repeatedly stressed the 
importance of implementing structural 

reforms and welcomes the determination of 

the Commission and the Member States to 

implement the renewed Lisbon strategy at 

the EU and national levels. It is particularly 

important that the euro area countries 

implement comprehensive reform measures, as 

they share the responsibility for ensuring the 

smooth functioning of EMU.1.2 INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
THE TREATY OF LISBONOn 13 December 2007 the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States signed 
the Treaty of Lisbon amending the Treaty on 
European Union and the Treaty establishing 
the European Community. The new Treaty 
is now in the process of being ratiÞ ed by all 
27 Member States. The intention is for it to 
enter into force on 1 January 2009, provided 
that the ratiÞ cation process has been 
Þ nalised by that date. If this is not the case, the Treaty 
of Lisbon will enter into force on the Þ rst day 
of the month following ratiÞ cation by the last 
Member State. The new Treaty amends the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty 
on European Union. These two Treaties 
will continue to be the basis on which the 
EU functions. Under the new Treaty, the 
Community is succeeded and replaced by the 
Union, which will have legal personality. The 
ECB welcomes this simpliÞ cation of the EU™s 
legal and institutional framework. The ECB considered it essential that price stability should remain not only the primary 
objective of the ECB and the ESCB, but should 
also be a stated objective of the EU. The new In accordance with the 2005 mid-term review of the Lisbon 1 strategy, the Integrated Guidelines are determined for a period of three years and thereafter updated annually during that period 
(see the ECB™s Annual Report 2005, pp. 140-141).168ECBAnnual Report
2007Treaty provides for this, as well as making an Economic and Monetary Union, with the euro 
as its currency, an EU objective. The ECB, currently a Community body, becomes a Union institution. The ECB deemed 
it indispensable to the successful performance 
of its tasks that the speciÞ c institutional features 
of the ECB and of the ESCB be preserved. 
The new Treaty does this by conÞ rming the 
tasks and composition of the ESCB and the 
independence of the ECB and the NCBs, 
as well as the legal personality, regulatory 
powers and Þ nancial independence of the ECB. 
Under the new Treaty, the appointment of 
members of the ECB™s Executive Board takes 
place by a qualiÞ ed majority of the European 
Council, instead of the current requirement for 
a common accord of the governments of the 
Member States at the level of Heads of State 
or Government. Further to the ECB™s request, 
the term ﬁEurosystemﬂ is introduced into 
the Treaties. The new Treaty also introduces several 
innovations in the area of economic 

governance. These include recognition of 

the Eurogroup, which retains its current 

informal status. Its President will serve a 

two and a half year term. Moreover, the role 

of the euro area countries is strengthened. 

Although the EU Council will still decide, on 

the basis of a Commission proposal, whether 

a Member State can adopt the euro, the euro 

area countries will provide a recommendation 

prior to such a decision. Similarly, decisions 

on non-compliance by euro area countries 

with the excessive deÞ cit procedure and the 
Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will be 

taken only by euro area countries, and without 

the Member State concerned. Finally, a new 

provision allows the euro area countries, by a 

qualiÞ ed majority, to adopt new measures to 
strengthen the coordination and surveillance 

of their budgetary discipline and to set out 

speciÞ c economic policy guidelines for the 
euro area countries. 
The ECB considers that the new Treaty broadly conÞ rms the current set-up of EMU. It would 
therefore welcome the successful completion of 
the ratiÞ cation process. 
CONVERGENCE REPORTS 
Following requests from Cyprus and Malta, the 
ECB and the European Commission, in line 
with Article 122 of the Treaty, each prepared 
convergence reports on the progress made by 
these two countries in meeting the conditions 
to join the euro area. On the basis of these 
convergence reports, which were published 
on 16 May 2007, and a proposal from the 
Commission, the ECOFIN Council adopted a 
decision on 10 July 2007 allowing Cyprus and 
Malta to introduce the euro as their currency 
from 1 January 2008 (see Chapter 3). 1.3 DEVELOPMENTS IN AND RELATIONS WITH EU 
CANDIDATE COUNTRIESThe ECB continued its cooperation with the 
central banks of the candidate countries with 
the aim of creating the conditions for a smooth 
monetary integration process in the EU, when 
institutional and economic conditions have been 
met. This cooperation developed in parallel with 
the overall institutional dialogue between the 
EU and these countries. Accession negotiations with Croatia began in October 2005. The opening of individual 
chapters of the acquis communautaire for negotiation started in June 2006 and proceeded 
smoothly in 2007, with negotiations having 
been conducted on a substantial number of the 
35 chapters by the end of the year. The ECB 
continued to strengthen its bilateral relations 
with the Croatian National Bank, paying a staff 
visit to Zagreb in April 2007 and hosting its 
governor in Frankfurt for the annual high-level 
pre-accession dialogue in October 2007. 169ECBAnnual Report
2007After opening accession negotiations with Turkey in October 2005, the European 
Commission started negotiations on the 
individual chapters of the acquis communautaire in June 2006. In December 2006 the European 
Council decided to suspend talks for 8 out of the 
35 chapters in the EU accession process, owing 
to the lack of progress in the extension of the 
customs union to the EU Member States. Five 
chapters Œ on enterprise and industrial policy, 
statistics, Þ nancial control, trans-European 
networks, and health and consumer protection 
Œ were opened in the course of 2007. The 
EU institutions are continuing to screen the 
compatibility of Turkish legislation with the 
acquis communautaire and preparations are 
under way for the possible opening of the other 
chapters. The ECB continued its long-standing 
high-level policy dialogue with the Central Bank 
of the Republic of Turkey, which included a visit 
of the President of the ECB to Ankara on 1 June 
2007, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary 
of the Turkish central bank. The discussions 
focused on recent macroeconomic and Þ nancial developments in Turkey, the monetary policy of 
the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, and 
the economic and monetary situation in the euro 
area. In the course of 2007, technical assistance 
was also provided when requested by the 
Turkish central bank, for example in the areas of 
internal Þ nance and payment systems. 
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
was granted candidate status in December 
2005. However, the European Council decided 
that negotiations would not be opened until a 
number of conditions had been met, including 
the effective implementation of the Stabilisation 
and Association Agreement signed with the 
EU, and no exact date has yet been speciÞ ed. The Commission closely monitors progress 
achieved, and while it acknowledged that steps 
in the right direction have been taken, it listed 
several areas for reform where efforts need to 
be increased. Contacts between the ECB and the 
National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia 
were intensiÞ ed at the staff level.

20072 INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
2.1  KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMSURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
Given the rapid pace of economic and Þ nancial 
integration, the global economic environment 

is becoming increasingly relevant for the 

conduct of economic policy in the euro area. 

As a result, the Eurosystem closely monitors 

and analyses macroeconomic policies and 

underlying developments in countries outside the 

euro area. It also plays an important role in the 

process of international multilateral surveillance 

of macroeconomic policies, which takes 

place mainly at the meetings of international 

organisations such as the BIS, the IMF and the 

OECD, as well as in fora such as the G7 and G20 

Þ nance ministers and central bank governors. 
In relevant institutions and fora, the ECB has 

been granted either member status (for example, 

in the G20) or observer status (for example, 

at the IMF). The ECB assesses international 

developments with a view to contributing to a 

stable macroeconomic environment and sound 

macroeconomic and Þ nancial policies. 
The international economic environment in 
2007 continued to be dominated by large global 
current account imbalances, with some 
adjustments taking place in the United States 
and oil-exporting countries.2 In the United States, the current account deÞ cit declined 
slightly to 5.7% of GDP, from 6.2% in 2006, 
mainly reß ecting a more balanced pattern of 
global demand growth and favourable exchange 
rate developments. At the same time, the 
adjustments in the United States were not 
directly reß ected in the current account positions 
of Asian economies, which continued to enjoy 
substantial surpluses, reaching around 6.1% of 
GDP on average compared with 5.3% in 2006. 
In particular, current account surpluses widened 
to 11.7% in China and to 4.5% in Japan. 
However, the oil-exporting economies Œ also a 
major counterpart of the US current account 
deÞ cit Œ reduced their current account surpluses 
to 11.9% of GDP, from 16.1% in 2006. Some 
Asian and oil-exporting economies continued to accumulate considerable amounts of foreign 
reserves. The accumulation of reserves 
continued to be particularly signiÞ cant in the 
case of China, where foreign exchange reserves 
reached levels well above USD 1 trillion. The 
increase in foreign exchange reserves in surplus 
economies contributed to a rise in the importance 
of sovereign wealth funds in global 
Þ nancial markets. 
On various occasions, the Eurosystem continued 

to stress the risks and distortions related to the 

persistence of such imbalances. It also conÞ rmed 
its full support for a cooperative approach on 

this issue, whereby all affected economies 

implement the necessary policies to ensure 

an orderly adjustment of global imbalances. 

A progressive and orderly adjustment of the 

imbalances would support and strengthen 

the prospects for global growth and stability. 

The international policy agenda includes 

policies aimed at increasing private and public 

savings in countries with current account 

deÞ cits, urges implementation of further 
structural reforms in mature economies with 

relatively low potential growth, and stresses 

the need for an increase in domestic demand 

as well as for an improved capital allocation in 

emerging market economies. Since exchange 

rates should reß ect economic fundamentals, 
exchange rate ß exibility in major countries 
and regions that lack such ß exibility remains 
a priority. In China, the move towards greater 

ß exibility is desirable, and in view of its rising 
current account surplus and domestic inß ation, 
there is still a need to allow for an accelerated 

appreciation of its effective exchange rate. 

Overall, several developments and policy 

measures went in the right direction in 2007, 

but further adjustments are still needed if global 

imbalances are to be signiÞ cantly reduced. 
Global credit market conditions deteriorated 
in the second half of 2007, as a repricing 
of credit risk related to strains in the US 
sub-prime mortgage market led to a spike in 2007 estimates in this section are based on the projections 2 contained in the IMF™s September 2007 ﬁWorld Economic Outlookﬂ.171ECBAnnual Report
2007yields and disruptions to liquidity conditions in segments of the interbank market. While 
emerging economies were also affected by 
these developments, the impact there was far 
less severe than in previous episodes of global 
Þ nancial turbulence. This resilience partly 
reß ects the improved policy frameworks in these 
countries, although an additional explanation 
is that the Þ nancial turbulence was rooted in 
markets for innovative credit instruments that 
are less widespread in emerging economies 
than in mature economies with developed 
Þ nancial systems. 
Finally, the euro area itself is subject to 
international policy surveillance exercises. In 
2007 both the IMF and the OECD™s Economic 
and Development Review Committee conducted 
their regular reviews of the monetary, Þ nancial and economic policies of the euro area, as a 
complement to their reviews of the individual 
euro area countries. The Article IV consultations 
of the IMF and the review by the OECD™s 
Economic and Development Review Committee 
provided an opportunity for useful discussions 
between these international organisations 
and the ECB, the Eurogroup presidency and 
the European Commission. Following these 
discussions, both the IMF and the OECD 
produced individual reports assessing euro 
area policies.3 The euro area also participated in the IMF™s Þ rst multilateral consultation 
exercise, which focused on global imbalances 
(see the next section for more details). INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE 
Efforts to reform the IMF in line with its 
medium-term strategy continued over the year. 
Progress on the various initiatives proceeded at 
different speeds, with the most notable 
achievement being the introduction of a new 
decision on bilateral surveillance.4 Other key reform areas included governance of the IMF 
(quotas and voice), the income and expenditure 
framework of the Fund, and the Fund™s role in 
emerging market economies. Agreement on 
these issues is pursued through discussions both 
inside the IMF and in other fora, such as the G7 
and G20, and the ESCB plays its part by monitoring and contributing to the discussions 
on these issues as appropriate. One of the main recent achievements of the IMF has been an improvement in surveillance. A new 
decision on bilateral surveillance over members™ 
policies was introduced in mid-2007 to replace 
the existing 30-year-old surveillance decision 
and to improve clarity, candour, even-handedness 
and accountability. The new decision seeks to 
pay greater attention to cross-country spillovers 
by employing external stability as the organising 
principle for surveillance. External stability is 
deÞ ned with reference to the exchange rate, the 
analysis of which consequently becomes a key 
component of the surveillance process. Owing 
to the single currency of the euro area, external 
stability for the euro area is to be assessed at the 
level of the euro area as a whole, while bilateral 
country surveillance, focusing on the national 
policies of individual Member States, remains 
important also in this context. Efforts are now 
under way to ensure the effective implementation 
of the new decision, taking into account the 
technical and conceptual challenges. In addition, the Þ rst multilateral consultation 
process advanced to the monitoring stage. Multilateral consultations are a new approach 
to surveillance that aim to bring together key 
parties in a conÞ dential setting for a frank 
dialogue in order to facilitate appropriate policy 
action on problems of systemic or regional 
importance. The Þ rst multilateral consultation 
sought to address global imbalances and 
involved China, the euro area, Japan, Saudi 
Arabia and the United States. The forum served 
as a useful platform to exchange ideas and views 
on the causes of and solutions to the imbalances. 
The emphasis has now shifted from dialogue 
to policy implementation and IMF staff are 
monitoring progress and communicating their 
Þ ndings in bilateral and multilateral reports. 
ﬁEuro area policies: 2007 Article IV consultation Œ staff reportﬂ, 3 IMF, July 2007, and ﬁEconomic survey of the euro areaﬂ, OECD, January 2007. 
The Executive Board decision on bilateral surveillance over 4 members™ policies adopted on 15 June 2007 replaces the 1977 
decision on surveillance over exchange rate policies. 172ECBAnnual Report
2007Progress has also been made on other elements of the medium-term strategy. On the topic of 
quota and voice reform, discussions focused 
on a new quota formula, a second round of 
ad hoc increases in quotas for a broader range 
of countries, and an increase in basic votes. 
The two key objectives of the reforms are to 
make signiÞ cant progress in realigning quota 
shares with members™ relative weight and role 
in the global economy and to enhance the voice 
and participation of low-income countries in the 
IMF. Agreement on the main elements of the 
package is expected to be achieved by the 2008 
Spring Meetings. Efforts are also under way to 
put the institution on a sounder Þ nancial footing. 
On the income side, the recommendations 
made in the report by the Committee of 
Eminent Persons (a body appointed to study 
the sustainable long-term Þ nancing of the IMF) 
provide the basis for speciÞ c proposals. On the 
expenditure side, consideration of the Fund™s 
core mandate and careful priority-setting 
are guiding proposals for a new expenditure 
framework, which envisages substantial budget 
reductions. Finally, work is also continuing on 
the Fund™s engagement with emerging market 
economies. The Fund improved its assistance 
in identifying vulnerabilities and in debt 
management, and continued to reß ect on the 
option of a new liquidity instrument as a crisis 
prevention measure. Beyond IMF reforms, the agenda of the international Þ nancial community continued 
to feature the promotion of mechanisms for 
crisis prevention and orderly crisis resolution. 
In this context, progress was made in the 
implementation of the principles for stable 
capital ß ows and fair debt restructuring in 
emerging markets, which were endorsed by the 
G20 in 2004. The aim of these principles, which 
are market-based and voluntary, is to provide 
guidelines for the behaviour of sovereign 
issuers and their private creditors regarding 
information-sharing, dialogue and close 
cooperation. An increasing number of 
Þ nancial institutions and issuing countries 
have voiced support for the principles and 
expressed particular interest in advancing their implementation. To guide the implementation 
and evolution of the principles, a Group of 
Trustees, comprising senior leaders in global 
Þ nance, was established in 2006. At its last 
meeting in Washington, D.C. in October 2007, 
the Group of Trustees reviewed the progress 
being made on the implementation of the 
principles within the framework of the 
international Þ nancial architecture. 
A number of other initiatives related to Þ nancial 
markets were taken in the course of 2007. 

Drawing on the example provided by the private 

sector with the aforementioned principles, a code 

of conduct for hedge funds was put forward by 

a group of leading London-based hedge funds. 

The code, which is voluntary, is designed to 

improve transparency and risk management. 

Additionally, the G8 agreed on an action plan 

for developing local bond markets in emerging 

market economies and developing countries. 

The action plan speciÞ ed a number of key policy 
issues for further detailed examination, including 

strengthening market infrastructures and public 

debt management policies, broadening and 

diversifying the investor base, developing 

derivative and swap markets, improving databases 

and promoting regional initiatives. The goal is to 

increase the depth and efÞ ciency of local bond 
markets so that they can play their full role in 

Þ nancial intermediation, 
Þ nancial stability and 
sustained economic growth. Finally, highlighting 

increasing interest in the role and operations 

of sovereign wealth funds, the International 

Monetary and Financial Committee requested 

that the IMF open a dialogue with sovereign asset 

and reserve managers. The Þ rst round table was 
convened in November 2007. 
2.2 COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 
THE EUAs part of its international activities, the 
Eurosystem continued to develop its contacts 
with the central banking community outside the 
EU, mainly through the organisation of seminars 
and workshops. Moreover, technical cooperation 
has become an important tool supporting 173ECBAnnual Report
2007institution-building and enhancing effective compliance with European and international 
standards at institutions outside the EU. The Eurosystem held its fourth bilateral high-level seminar with the Central Bank of the 
Russian Federation (Bank of Russia) in October 
2007 in Moscow. Seminar participants exchanged 
views on the current challenges for monetary and 
exchange rate policy in Russia, as well as on the 
process of Þ nancial deepening and its implications 
for the monetary policy transmission mechanism 
both in Russia and in other mature and emerging 
market economies. Furthermore, after reviewing 
the challenges of and the prospects for EU and 
euro area enlargement, the discussion focused 
on the implications for Russia. Similar events 
will continue to be organised on a regular basis, 
with the next seminar to be held in Vienna in 
spring 2009. Following up on the discussions at the high-level Eurosystem/Bank of Russia seminar 
held in Dresden in October 2006, the Bank 
of Russia hosted an expert workshop on the 
long-term growth prospects of the Russian 
economy in Tula on 14 June 2007. Bank of 
Russia staff, as well as other experts from the 
Russian government and Þ nancial community, 
exchanged views with Eurosystem economists 
on the determinants of growth in and the 
prospects for the Russian economy. At the 
workshop, presentations were given on, among 
other topics, ﬁLong-term challenges for the 
Russian economy: oil price dependency and 
Dutch diseaseﬂ and ﬁForecasting GDP growth 
in Russia and the role of policiesﬂ. Technical cooperation with the Bank of Russia continues. For example, in October 2007 the 
ECB hosted two high-level study visits in the 
areas of market operations and internal Þ nance. The Bank of Russia, the ECB and euro area 
NCBs have also engaged in close cooperation 
as a follow-up to the large-scale banking 
supervision training programme that was 
implemented between 2003 and 2005. A new 
central bank cooperation programme, funded 
by the European Commission, is envisaged to start on 1 April 2008, ending in December 2010. 
One aim of the programme is to enhance the 
internal audit capacity of the Bank of Russia 
through the transfer of EU knowledge and 
experience in the area of risk-based internal 
audits. Another aim is to pursue a gradual 
implementation of the Basel II principles 
for banking supervision in Russia through 
consultations and the sharing of the EU 
experience with the implementation of the EU™s 
Capital Requirements Directive. Advice in the 
area of payment systems was extended to the 
Commonwealth of Independent States through 
a seminar hosted by the National Bank of 
Kazakhstan in September 2007. The fourth high-level Eurosystem seminar with governors of central banks of the EU™s 
euro-Mediterranean partners took place in 
Valencia on 28 March 2007, while the Þ fth will be held in Cairo on 26 November 2008. 
Discussions in Valencia focused, among 
other things, on Þ scal policy in Mediterranean 
countries and euro-Mediterranean trade. Several 
ECB visits took place at the staff level to the 
central banks of the Maghreb countries, for 
example the Bank of Algeria (February 2007), 
the Bank Al-Maghrib (November 2007) and the 
Central Bank of Tunisia (November 2007). The ECB continued to deepen its relations with the central banks and monetary agencies of the 
member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC).5 The ECB also provided the GCC with advice in the areas of payment systems and 
banknotes. Together with the Deutsche 
Bundesbank, the ECB will organise a high-level Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United 5 Arab Emirates.174ECBAnnual Report
2007Eurosystem seminar with central banks and monetary authorities of the GCC on 
11-12 March 2008 in Mainz. On 25 November 
2007 the ECB, together with four euro area 
NCBs (Deutsche Bundesbank, Bank of Greece, 
Banque de France and Banca d™Italia), 
completed a two-year cooperation programme 
with the Central Bank of Egypt, funded by the 
European Commission. The programme 
supported the Central Bank of Egypt in its 
far-reaching reform agenda, focusing on the 
introduction of a risk-based approach to banking 
supervision and improving its supervisory 
capacities. For this purpose, six projects in the 
areas of ongoing supervision, inspections and 
controls, macro-prudential supervision, legal 
matters and standard-setting, training, and 
information technology were established in 
which each of the four NCBs assumed a 
mentorship and closely cooperated with a team 
leader from the Central Bank of Egypt. The ECB and a number of NCBs further deepened 
their relations with countries in the western 

Balkans. On 1-2 October 2007 the ECB organised 

the second economic conference on the region in 

Frankfurt, broadening its focus to all countries in 

central, eastern and south-eastern Europe. Senior 

central bank experts from EU Member States 

and south-eastern European countries, as well as 

representatives from the European Commission, 

international organisations and academia, 

discussed selected aspects of and key challenges 

for real convergence in the region. 
The ECB, together with eight NCBs (Deutsche Bundesbank, Eesti Pank, Bank of Greece, 
Banco de España, Banque de France, Banca 
d™Italia, Oesterreichische Nationalbank and 
Banka Slovenije), provided the Central Bank of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina with a needs analysis 
report on progress to be made in selected central 
banking areas in preparation for EU accession. 
The report, which concluded a mission initiated 
on 1 March 2007, was ofÞ cially delivered by the 
Eurosystem on 12 September 2007. It contains 
recommendations on areas in which the Central 
Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to 
make progress over the coming years in order to bring its standards into line with those adopted 
by the ESCB. The programme was funded by the 
European Commission through the Community 
Assistance for Reconstruction, Development 
and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme and 
coordinated by the ECB. CHAPTER 6ACCOUNTABILITY 
178ECBAnnual Report
2007Over the past decades, central bank independence has emerged as a fundamental component of the 
monetary policy frameworks of industrialised 
and emerging economies. The decision to grant 
central banks independence is Þ rmly grounded 
in economic theory and empirical evidence, both 
of which show that such a set-up is conducive to 
maintaining price stability. At the same time, it 
is a founding principle of democratic societies 
that public authorities should be accountable to 
the general public, from which their mandate 
ultimately derives. In the case of an independent 
central bank, accountability can be understood 
as the obligation to explain how it used its 
powers and to justify its decisions to citizens 
and their elected representatives.The ECB has always fully acknowledged the fundamental importance of being accountable 
for its policy decisions and to this end has 
maintained a regular dialogue with EU 
citizens and the European Parliament. The 
ECB exceeds the reporting requirements laid 
down in the Treaty, for instance by publishing 
a Monthly Bulletin rather than the required 
quarterly report. It also holds a press conference 
following the Þ rst Governing Council meeting 
of the month. The ECB™s commitment to the 
principle of accountability is further illustrated 
by the numerous ECB publications released 
and the large number of speeches delivered by 
the members of the Governing Council during 
2007, explaining the ECB™s decisions.At the institutional level, the European Parliament Œ as the body which derives its 
legitimacy directly from the citizens of the EU Œ 
plays a key role in holding the ECB to account. 
In line with the provisions of the Treaty, the 
President presented the ECB™s Annual Report 
2006 to the plenary session of the European 
Parliament in 2007. In addition, the President 
continued to report regularly on the ECB™s 
monetary policy and its other tasks during his 
quarterly hearings before the Committee on 
Economic and Monetary Affairs. The President 
was invited to an additional hearing before this 
Committee to explain the ECB™s operations in 
the money market in response to the Þ nancial market turmoil during the second half of 2007, 
and to discuss the potential lessons for the 
framework for Þ nancial regulation, supervision 
and stability. The President also appeared before 
a joint meeting of the European Parliament and 
the national parliaments to exchange views on 
economic convergence in the euro area. Other members of the Executive Board were also invited to appear before the European 
Parliament on a number of occasions. The 
Vice-President presented the ECB™s Annual 
Report 2006 to the Committee on Economic and 
Monetary Affairs. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell 
appeared twice before the Committee to provide 
information on recent developments in the Þ eld of securities clearing and settlement and the 
Eurosystem™s TARGET2-Securities project. As in previous years, a delegation of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs 
visited the ECB to exchange views with the 
members of the Executive Board. The ECB also 
continued its voluntary practice of replying to 
written questions from members of the European 
Parliament on issues related to the ECB™s Þ elds of competence. 1 ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT179ECBAnnual Report
2007During the various exchanges of views between the European Parliament and the ECB, a wide 
range of issues were addressed. The key issues 
raised by the European Parliament during these 
exchanges of views are outlined below. THE EU FRAMEWORK FOR FINANCIAL 

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND STABILITYThe European Parliament and the ECB 
continued their close dialogue on matters 
concerning Þ nancial integration and stability. In 
its resolution on Þ nancial services policy (2005-
2010), the Parliament, while recognising that 
hedge funds can provide an additional source of 
liquidity and diversiÞ cation in the market and 
create opportunities to improve corporate 
efÞ ciency, shared the concerns of some central 
banks and supervisors that such funds may be a 
source of systemic risk. Accordingly, it called 
for increased cooperation among supervisors in 
taking forward the recommendations of the 
Financial Stability Forum and urged investors, 
core intermediaries and public authorities to 
assess the potential counterparty risks presented 
by hedge funds. The European Parliament also 
noted the high degree of concentration in the 
credit rating agency sector, and recommended 
greater transparency with regard to the working 
methods of these entities. In respect of Þ nancial supervision, the Parliament expressed concern 
that the current framework may fail to keep 
pace with Þ nancial market dynamics and 
stressed that it must be sufÞ ciently resourced, 
coordinated and legally entitled to provide 
adequate and quick responses in the event of 
major cross-border systemic crises. It thus 
considered it necessary to allow the relatively 
new Level 2 and Level 3 arrangements of the 
Lamfalussy framework 1 time to become established and, at the same time, to look into 
the desirability and feasibility of execution of 
prudential supervision at the EU level where 
needed in the future. The President of the ECB emphasised that the reassessment of risk which had taken place in the 
second half of 2007 reß ected the materialisation 
of some of the vulnerabilities that had 
previously been identiÞ ed by the ECB and other 
central banks. He perceived a need to increase 
transparency and improve risk management with 
regard to sophisticated Þ nancial products. The 
President acknowledged that the small number 
of global credit rating agencies was a real issue 
for the functioning of global Þ nance. At the same 
time, he stressed that investors must not treat 
the opinion of rating agencies as a substitute 
for their own credit analysis and due diligence. 
On the subject of hedge funds, he underlined 
the positive role they played in enhancing the 
efÞ ciency and liquidity of 
Þ nancial markets, 
whilst acknowledging that they can also 
represent a source of risk to the stability of 
the Þ nancial system. He therefore advocated a 
rapid implementation of the recommendations 
of the Financial Stability Forum and supported 
the proposal that the hedge fund sector would 
strive for best practices and that industry-led 
benchmarks would be a suitable tool to pursue 
this objective. He also noted the need for a 
substantial improvement in the understanding 
of non-regulated entities, such as conduits and 
special purpose vehicles, and asked to continue 
the thorough examination of all non-regulated 
entities. Finally, he stressed that the potential of 
the Lamfalussy framework should be exploited 
to the maximum extent possible before any far-
reaching institutional changes were considered 
(see Chapter 4). PUBLIC FINANCESThe conduct of Þ scal policies 
Þ gured prominently 
in the discussions between the European 
Parliament and the ECB. In its resolution on 
the European Commission™s ﬁPublic Þ nances in EMU 2006ﬂ report, the European Parliament The Lamfalussy approach is composed of four levels. 
1 At Level 1, the basic principles of the legislation are laid 
down via the normal legislative process: a co-decision 

procedure involving the European Parliament and the 

EU Council, acting on a proposal of the European 

Commission. At Level 2, measures for the implementation 

of Level 1 legislation are adopted and amended via 

fast-track procedures. Level 3 relates to the work of the 

Level 3 Committees to strengthen supervisory convergence 

and cooperation. Level 4 relates to Commission measures 

to strengthen the enforcement of EU law. For more details, 

see the ﬁFinal report of the Committee of Wise Men on the 

regulation of European securities marketsﬂ, 15 February 

2001, which is available on the European Commission™s 

website. See also the ECB™s Annual Report 2003, p. 111.2 SELECTED TOPICS RAISED AT MEETINGS WITH 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT180ECBAnnual Report
2007supported a strict application of the Stability and Growth Pact and called for renewed efforts by 
Member States to use the economic upswing to 
prepare their public Þ nances for the challenges 
of the future, notably an ageing population. In its 
resolution on the Commission™s annual report on 
the euro area, the European Parliament therefore 
welcomed the orientations for Þ scal policies 
adopted by the Eurogroup in April 2007, which 
recalled the commitment to actively consolidate 
public Þ nances in ﬁgood timesﬂ and to use 
windfall revenues for deÞ cit and debt reduction.
The President of the ECB stressed that the 

economic good times should be used to rapidly 

address the remaining budgetary imbalances in 

euro area countries, as well as to accelerate the 

adjustment towards their medium-term objectives. 

Against this background, he urged all euro area 

countries to honour the commitment made in the 

Eurogroup to reach their medium-term budgetary 

objectives as soon as possible and by 2010 at the 

latest (see Section 1.1 of Chapter 5).PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSThe ECB continued to inform the European 
Parliament about its ongoing activities in the 
Þ eld of payment systems and securities clearing 
and settlement systems. Gertrude Tumpel-
Gugerell appeared twice before the Committee 
on Economic and Monetary Affairs to report on 
the progress made in establishing a Eurosystem 
infrastructure for the provision of securities 
settlement services in central bank money, called 
TARGET2-Securities. The ECB also welcomed the adoption by the European Parliament and the 
EU Council of the Payment Services Directive 
in 2007, as it provides the legal foundation for 
the creation of a Single Euro Payments Area 
(SEPA) (see Section 3 of Chapter 4). In its own-initiative resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report 2006, the European Parliament 
fully supported the ECB™s efforts to foster 
Þ nancial integration by acting as a catalyst for 
private sector initiatives, such as the SEPA. The 
Parliament also considered that the TARGET2-
Securities project might have the potential to 
enhance the integration, efÞ ciency and safety of 
the European securities settlement infrastructure. 
At the same time, it deemed it essential that 
an appropriate governance framework be put 
in place. In its resolution on Þ nancial services 
policy (2005-2010), the European Parliament 
called for further progress in removing the 
barriers identiÞ ed in the Giovannini Group™s 
report on cross-border clearing and settlement 
arrangements (see Section 2 of Chapter 2). CHAPTER 7

Communication at the ECB aims to enhance the public™s understanding of the ECB™s 
decisions. It is an integral part of the ECB™s 
monetary policy and of its other tasks. Two 
key elements Œ openness and transparency Œ 
guide the ECB™s communication activities. 
Both contribute to the effectiveness, efÞ ciency and credibility of the ECB™s monetary policy. 
They also support the ECB™s efforts to give 
full account of its actions, as explained in more 
detail in Chapter 6. The concept of real-time, regular and comprehensive explanations of the monetary 
policy assessment and decisions, which was 
introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely 
open and transparent approach to central bank 
communication. Monetary policy decisions are 
explained at a press conference immediately 
after the Governing Council has taken them. 
The President delivers a detailed introductory 
statement at the press conference, explaining 
the Governing Council™s decisions. The 
President and the Vice-President are then at 
the media™s disposal to answer questions. 
Since December 2004 decisions taken by the 
Governing Council other than those setting 
interest rates have also been published every 
month on the websites of the Eurosystem central 
banks. The ECB™s legal acts are made available in all the ofÞ cial languages of the EU, as are the 
consolidated Þ nancial statements of the 
Eurosystem.1 The ECB™s Annual Report and the quarterly issues of its Monthly Bulletin are also 
made available in full in the ofÞ cial EU 
languages.2 The Convergence Report is made available either in full or in summary form in all 
ofÞ cial EU languages.
3 For the purposes of public accountability and transparency, the ECB 
also publishes other documentation in addition 
to the statutory publications in some or all 
ofÞ cial languages, in particular press releases 
announcing monetary policy decisions, staff 
macroeconomic projections, 4 policy positions and information material of relevance to the 
general public. The preparation, publication and 
distribution of the national language versions of the ECB™s key publications are undertaken in 
close collaboration with the NCBs. With the exception of Irish, for which a derogation at the EU 1 level is in effect.With the exception of Irish (by EU derogation) and Maltese (by 2 agreement with the Central Bank of Malta, following the lifting 
of the temporary EU derogation in May 2007).
See footnote 2.3 ECB staff projections since September 2004 and Eurosystem 4 staff projections since December 2000.185ECBAnnual Report
2007The ECB needs to address a variety of audiences, such as Þ nancial experts, the media, 
governments, parliaments and the general public, 
with varying levels of knowledge of Þ nance and economics. Its mandate and decisions 
are therefore explained through a range of 
communication tools and activities which are 
constantly being reÞ ned in order to make them 
as effective as possible, taking into account the 
different audiences. The ECB publishes a number of studies and reports, such as the Annual Report, which 
presents a review of the ECB™s activities in 
the previous year and thus helps to hold the 
ECB accountable for its actions. The Monthly 
Bulletin provides regular updates of the 
ECB™s assessment of economic and monetary 
developments and the detailed information 
underlying its decisions, while the Financial 
Stability Review assesses the stability of the 
euro area Þ nancial system with regard to its 
ability to absorb adverse shocks. All members of the Governing Council directly contribute to enhancing public knowledge 
and understanding of the Eurosystem™s tasks 
and policies by giving testimonies before the 
European Parliament and national parliaments, 
delivering public speeches and granting 
interviews to the media. In 2007 the President 
of the ECB appeared seven times before the 
European Parliament, and these hearings also 
started to be webcast on the ECB™s website.The members of the Executive Board delivered around 220 speeches to a variety of audiences 
in 2007 and granted numerous interviews, as 
well as having articles published in journals, 
magazines and newspapers. The ECB organised 15 seminars addressed to international and national media in 2007. Three 
of these seminars were organised in cooperation 
with the European Commission and four in 
cooperation with EU NCBs. The ECB continued to contribute to the dissemination of research Þ ndings by publishing 
Working Papers and Occasional Papers and by 
organising academic conferences, seminars and 
workshops (see Section 5 of Chapter 2).The euro area NCBs play an important role in ensuring the dissemination at the national 
level of Eurosystem information and messages 
to the general public and interested parties. 
They address a variety of national and 
regional audiences in their own languages and 
environments. In 2007 the ECB, in conjunction with the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta, 
organised information campaigns in preparation 
for the introduction of the euro in Cyprus and 
Malta on 1 January 2008. The logo ﬁ• Our 
moneyﬂ, which is based on the logo used for the 
information campaign for the introduction of 
the euro banknotes and coins in 2002, was used 
in all the joint communication activities for the 
changeover in Cyprus and Malta. The campaigns 
followed the pattern of the communication 
strategy developed for Slovenia™s entry into 
the euro area on 1 January 2007. They aimed 
to familiarise professional cash handlers and 
the general public with the visual appearance 
and security features of the euro banknotes 
and coins, as well as with the cash changeover 
procedures (see Section 4 of Chapter 3). The ECB welcomed around 13,500 visitors to its premises in Frankfurt in 2007. The visitors 
received Þ rst-hand information in the form 
of lectures and presentations given by ECB 
experts. University students and professionals 
from the Þ nancial sector made up the majority 
of visitors. All documents published by the ECB and its various activities are presented on the ECB™s 
website, which received 15 million visits in 
2007 (with 15 million documents downloaded). 2 COMMUNICATION 
ACTIVITIES186ECBAnnual Report
2007In particular, the information kit entitled ﬁPrice stability: why is it important for you?ﬂ 5 for young teenagers and their teachers, produced by 
the ECB in cooperation with the euro area NCBs 
in all ofÞ cial EU languages, received a high 
level of attention from users. The kit consists of 
an eight-minute animated Þ lm, lea
ß ets for pupils 
and a teachers™ booklet. The Þ lm features
two secondary school pupils Þ nding out
about price stability. The leaß ets provide an 
easy-to-understand overview of the topic,
while the booklet provides greater detail for 
teachers. Around 60,000 public enquiries involving requests for information on different aspects of 
the ECB™s activities were handled in 2007.The ECB holds an annual Cultural Days 
programme which aims to bring the cultural 

diversity of the EU Member States closer 

to the staff of the ECB and the ESCB, to the 

international Þ nancial community in Frankfurt 
as well as to the residents of Frankfurt and the 

surrounding region. Each year this initiative 

highlights the richness of the culture of one EU 

country, thus fostering a better understanding 

of the nations in the EU. In 2007 the Cultural 

Days programme focused on Greece, following 

on from Austria, Hungary, Poland and Portugal 

in previous years. The programme was 

organised in close cooperation with the Bank 

of Greece and took place between 24 October 

and 13 November 2007. 
The information kit can be accessed on the ECB™s website under 5 http://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/educational/pricestab/html/index.en.htmlCHAPTER 8INSTITUTIONALFRAMEWORK,
ORGANISATION AND
ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
191ECBAnnual Report
2007The Eurosystem is the central banking 
system of the euro area. It comprises the 

ECB and the NCBs of the EU Member 

States whose currency is the euro (15 since 

1 January 2008). The Governing Council 

adopted the term ﬁEurosystemﬂ in order to 

facilitate understanding of the structure of 

central banking in the euro area. The term 

underlines the shared identity, teamwork and 

cooperation of all of its members. The Treaty 

of Lisbon incorporates the term ﬁEurosystemﬂ 

(see Section 1.2 of Chapter 5). 
The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the NCBs of all EU Member States 
(27 since 1 January 2007), i.e. it includes the 
NCBs of the Member States which have not yet 
adopted the euro. The ECB is the core of the Eurosystem and the 
ESCB and ensures that their respective tasks 
are carried out either through its own activities 
or via the NCBs. It has legal personality under 
public international law. Each NCB has legal personality according to the law of its respective country. The euro 
area NCBs, which form an integral part of the 
Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred upon 
the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules 
established by the ECB™s decision-making 
bodies. The NCBs also contribute to the work 
of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through 
their participation in the Eurosystem/ESCB 
committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). 
They may perform non-Eurosystem functions on 
their own responsibility, unless the Governing 1 DECISION-MAKING BODIES AND CORPORATE

2007Council Þ nds that such functions interfere with 
the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the 
Governing Council and the Executive Board. 
The General Council is constituted as a third 
decision-making body of the ECB, for as long 
as there are EU Member States which have not 
yet adopted the euro. The functioning of the 
decision-making bodies is governed by the 
Treaty, the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant 
Rules of Procedure. 1 Decision-making within the Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised. 
However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs 
jointly contribute, strategically and operationally, 
to attaining the common goals of the Eurosystem, 
with due respect to the principle of 
decentralisation in accordance with the Statute 
of the ESCB. 1.2 THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
The Governing Council comprises the 
members of the Executive Board of the ECB 
and the governors of the NCBs of the Member 
States which have adopted the euro. Its main 
responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaty, are:to adopt the guidelines and take the decisions  Œ
necessary to ensure the performance of the 
tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem; to formulate the monetary policy of the  Œ
euro area, including, as appropriate, decisions relating to intermediate monetary 
objectives, key interest rates and the supply 
of reserves in the Eurosystem, and to 
establish the necessary guidelines for their 
implementation. The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice 
a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt am 
Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an in-
depth assessment of monetary and economic 
developments and takes related decisions 
speciÞ cally at its 
Þ rst meeting of the month, 
while the second meeting usually focuses on issues related to other tasks and responsibilities 
of the ECB and the Eurosystem. In 2007 two 
meetings were held outside Frankfurt: one 
was hosted by the Central Bank and Financial 
Services Authority of Ireland in Dublin and the 
other by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in 
Vienna. When taking decisions on monetary policy and on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, 
the members of the Governing Council do not 
act as national representatives, but in a fully 
independent personal capacity. This is reß ected by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ 
applied within the Governing Council. For the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, see Decision ECB/2004/2 1 of 19 February 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 33; Decision 
ECB/2004/12 of 17 June 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure 
of the General Council of the ECB, OJ L 230, 30.6.2004,
p. 61; and Decision ECB/1999/7 of 12 October 1999 concerning 
the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board of the ECB, 
OJ L 314, 8.12.1999, p. 34. These rules are also available on the

20071.3 THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
The Executive Board comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and four other 
members appointed by common accord by the 
Heads of State or Government of the Member 
States which have adopted the euro. The main 
responsibilities of the Executive Board, which 
as a rule meets once a week, are:to prepare the meetings of the Governing  Œ
Council;
to implement the monetary policy of the  Œ
euro area in accordance with the guidelines 
and decisions laid down by the Governing Council and, in doing so, to give the 
necessary instructions to the euro area 
NCBs;
to manage the current business of the ECB; Œ
to exercise certain powers delegated to it by  Œ
the Governing Council, including some of a 
regulatory nature. The Executive Board is assisted by a 
Management Committee in matters relating 
to the ECB™s management, business planning 
and annual budget process. The Management 
Committee is composed of one Executive Board 
member, who acts as Chairman, and a number 
of senior managers. Back row (left to right):Jürgen Stark,José Manuel González-Páramo,Lorenzo Bini SmaghiFront row (left to right):Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell,Jean-Claude Trichet,Lucas D. PapademosJean-Claude Trichet

Member States. It mainly carries out those tasks 
taken over from the EMI which still have to be performed by the ECB on account of the fact 
that not all the Member States have adopted 
the euro. In 2007 the General Council met Þ ve times. Since January 2007 the governors of

AND THE EUROSYSTEM IT STEERING COMMITTEE198ECBAnnual Report
2007The Eurosystem/ESCB committees have 
continued to play an important role in assisting 

the ECB™s decision-making bodies in the 

performance of their tasks. At the request of 

both the Governing Council and the Executive 

Board, the committees have provided 

expertise in their Þ elds of competence and 
have facilitated the decision-making process. 

Membership of the committees is usually 

restricted to staff of the Eurosystem central 

banks. However, the NCBs of the Member 

States which have not yet adopted the euro 

take part in the meetings of a committee 

whenever it deals with matters that fall within 

the Þ eld of competence of the General Council. 
Where appropriate, other competent bodies, 

such as national supervisory authorities 

in the case of the Banking Supervision 

Committee, may also be invited. In July 

2007 the Committee on Cost Methodology 

was established as a Eurosystem/ESCB 

committee under Article 9.1 of the Rules of 

Procedure of the ECB, bringing the number of 

Eurosystem/ESCB committees which have 

been established under this Article to 13. 
The Budget Committee, which was established under Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure, 
assists the Governing Council in matters related 
to the ECB™s budget. The Human Resources Conference was established in 2005 under 
Article 9a of the Rules of Procedure as a forum 
for the exchange of experience, expertise 
and information among Eurosystem/ESCB 
central banks in the Þ eld of human resources 
management.In August 2007 the Governing Council 
established the Eurosystem IT Steering 
Committee (EISC) with a mandate to steer 
continuous improvement in the use of IT within 
the Eurosystem. The EISC™s responsibilities 
relate in particular to Eurosystem IT governance, 
covering such areas as the development and 
maintenance of policies for IT architecture 
and security, the identiÞ cation of IT demand, 
IT project portfolio management and 
prioritisation, IT project planning, realisation 
and control, and the monitoring of IT systems and operations. The EISC is expected to 
increase the efÞ ciency and effectiveness of 
the Governing Council™s decision-making on 
Eurosystem/ESCB IT projects and operations by 
considering proposals from ESCB committees 
or Eurosystem central banks prior to discussion 
by the Governing Council, and by submitting 
reports on these proposals to the Governing 
Council. The EISC reports to the Governing 
Council via the Executive Board.1.6 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In addition to the decision-making bodies, the 
corporate governance of the ECB encompasses 
a number of external and internal control 
layers, three codes of conduct as well as rules 
concerning public access to ECB documents. EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe Statute of the ESCB provides for two layers, 
namely the external auditor, which is appointed 
to audit the annual accounts of the ECB 
(Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB), and 
the European Court of Auditors, which examines 
the operational efÞ ciency of the management of 
the ECB (Article 27.2). The annual report of the 
European Court of Auditors, together with the 
ECB™s reply, is published on the ECB™s website 
and in the OfÞ cial Journal of the European 
Union. In order to reinforce public assurance as 
to the independence of the ECB™s external 
auditor, the principle of audit Þ rm rotation is 
applied. 3INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe internal control structure of the ECB is 
based on the functional approach that each 
organisational unit (section, division, directorate 
or directorate general) is responsible for 
managing its own risks, controls, effectiveness 
and efÞ ciency. Each organisational unit 
implements operational control procedures KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG Wirtschafts-3 prüfungsgesellschaft was the ECB™s external auditor for the Þ nancial years 2003-07. Following the conclusion of a public 
tender procedure and in line with the ECB™s agreed practice of 
rotating audit Þ rms, a new external auditor for the 
Þ nancial years 
2008-12 will be appointed.199ECBAnnual Report
2007within its area of responsibility in accordance with the risk tolerance set ex ante by the 
Executive Board. For example, a set of rules and 
procedures Œ known as a Chinese wall Œ is in 
place to prevent inside information originating 
in the areas responsible for monetary policy 
from reaching the areas responsible for the 
management of the ECB™s foreign reserves 
and own funds portfolio. The ECB enhanced 
its approach to operational risk management 
during 2007 by creating an umbrella framework 
which allows operational risks to be managed in 
a consistent, structured and integrated manner 
by bringing together a number of risk and 
control policies, procedures and instruments. 
In addition, the Directorate General Human 
Resources, Budget and Organisation monitors 
the portfolio of risks and the internal control 
structure and makes proposals to improve the 
effectiveness of risk identiÞ cation, assessment 
and treatment in the ECB. Independently from the internal control structure and risk monitoring of the ECB, audit missions 
are performed by the Directorate Internal Audit 
under the direct responsibility of the Executive 
Board. In accordance with the mandate deÞ ned in the ECB Audit Charter, 4 the ECB™s internal auditors provide independent and objective 
assurance and consulting services, bringing a 
systematic approach to evaluating and improving 
the effectiveness of risk management, control and 
governance processes. The Directorate Internal 
Audit abides by the International Standards for 
the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing of 
the Institute of Internal Auditors. A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal Auditors Committee, which is composed of 
the heads of internal audit at the ECB and the 
NCBs, is responsible for coordinating the 
auditing of Eurosystem/ESCB joint projects and 
operational systems. In order to enhance corporate governance, the Governing Council decided to create an ECB 
Audit Committee as of April 2007, composed 
of three of its members, with John Hurley (Governor of the Central Bank and Financial 
Services Authority of Ireland) as Chairman. CODES OF CONDUCTThere are three codes of conduct in place at the 

ECB. The Þ rst is for the members of the 
Governing Council and reß ects their 
responsibility to safeguard the integrity and 

reputation of the Eurosystem and to maintain 

the effectiveness of its operations. 5 It gives 
guidance to, and sets ethical standards for, the 

members of the Governing Council and their 

alternates when exercising their functions as 

members of the Governing Council. An adviser 

has also been appointed by the Governing 

Council to provide guidance to its members on 

some aspects of professional conduct. The 

second code is the Code of Conduct of the 

European Central Bank, which gives guidance 

to, and sets benchmarks for, the staff of the 

ECB and the members of the Executive Board, 

all of whom are expected to maintain high

ANTI-FRAUD MEASURESIn 1999 the European Parliament and the EU 
Council adopted a regulation 9 to step up the Þ ght against fraud, corruption and any other 
illegal activity detrimental to the Communities™ 
Þ nancial interests. The regulation provides inter 
alia for the internal investigation of suspected 
fraud by the European Anti-Fraud OfÞ ce (OLAF) within the Community institutions, 
bodies, ofÞ ces and agencies. 
The OLAF Regulation foresees that each of the 
latter adopt decisions in order for OLAF to be 
able to carry out its investigations within each 
of them. In June 2004 the Governing Council 
adopted a decision 10 concerning the terms and conditions for investigations by OLAF of the 
ECB, which entered into force on 1 July 2004. PUBLIC ACCESS TO ECB DOCUMENTSThe ECB™s Decision on public access to ECB 
documents 11 adopted in March 2004 is in line with the objectives and standards applied by 
other Community institutions and bodies with 
regard to public access to their documents. It 
enhances transparency, while at the same time 
taking into account the independence of the 
ECB and of the NCBs and ensuring the 
conÞ dentiality of certain matters speci
Þ c to the 
performance of the ECB™s tasks. 12 In 2007 the number of public access requests 
remained limited.Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament 9 and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud OfÞ ce (OLAF),

20072.1 HUMAN RESOURCES 
In 2007 the ECB enhanced its human resources (HR) policy framework to underline the 
importance of its values and the HR basic 
principles. 13 This framework is also an instrument for explaining why speciÞ c HR 
policies have been chosen and how they relate 
to one another. Under the framework, policies 
relating to HR management fall into four main 
areas:CORPORATE CULTUREWith staff from the 27 EU Member States, 
the ECB has integrated diversity management 
into its HR practices to ensure that the individual 
competencies of staff are recognised and 
fully utilised for the purpose of achieving the 
ECB™s objectives. The management of diversity at the ECB is based on the diversity strategy launched in 2006. It seeks to ensure 
that all members of staff are treated with respect 
and that their performance is assessed on the 
basis of merit.The six ECB common values (competence, 
effectiveness and efÞ ciency, integrity, team spirit, 
transparency and accountability, and working for 

Europe) were further embedded in the HR policies 

with a view to shaping day-to-day behaviour and 

improving performance.STAFF DEVELOPMENTFollowing the introduction in 2006 of general 
principles for mobility which encourage 
members of staff to change positions after Þ ve years of service, internal mobility has received 
considerable support. Mobility is seen as an 
opportunity for staff to widen their expertise 
and develop their skills and as a means for the 
ECB to broaden awareness among its staff and 
increase synergies across business areas. In this 
respect, the internal recruitment policy, which 
places emphasis on broad competencies, aims 
to further facilitate internal staff mobility. In 
2007 a ﬁmobility windowﬂ was launched to 
foster exchanges between staff members as well 
as temporary internal transfers, for instance to 
cover for the absence of colleagues. In total, 152 members of staff, including 31 managers 
and advisers, moved internally to other positions 
in 2007, either on a temporary or on a long-term 
basis.The ECB™s external work experience scheme facilitates the secondment of staff 
to the 27 NCBs in the EU or to relevant 
international organisations (e.g. the IMF and 
the BIS) for periods of two to twelve months. 
23 members of staff were seconded under 
this scheme in 2007. In addition, the ECB 
granted unpaid leave, for up to three years, to 
36 members of staff. Many of them (19) 
took up employment at NCBs, international 
organisations or private companies. Others 
used these periods of unpaid leave for 
study purposes.In addition to promoting mobility, including managerial rotation, the HR strategy 
continued to focus on the development of 
ECB management and, in particular, on 
strengthening managerial skills through training 
and individual coaching. Training for managers 
concentrated on the enhancement of leadership 
skills, on performance and organisational 
change management, and on ﬁdignity at workﬂ 
as an essential pillar of the ECB™s diversity 
strategy.Managers also participated in an annual mandatory multi-source feedback exercise in 
which directly reporting staff, peers and external 
contacts identify areas for managers™ personal 
development. Based on the results of the multi-
source feedback, individual coaching can be 
provided.The continuous acquisition and development of skills and competencies by all members of staff 
remains a cornerstone of the ECB™s HR strategy. 
As a basic principle, learning and development 
are a shared responsibility between staff and 
institution. On the one hand, the ECB provides 
the budgetary means and training framework The HR basic principles are: organisational need, decentralised 13 staff management, merit, diversity, attractive employment conditions and reciprocal commitment.2 ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
202ECBAnnual Report
2007and managers deÞ ne the training needs of staff 
for their current position. On the other hand, staff have to take the necessary steps for learning 
and development and ensure that their expertise 
is maintained at the highest level. In addition 
to numerous in-house training opportunities, 
staff continued to take up external training 
opportunities to address individual training 
needs of a more technical nature. They also 
beneÞ ted from training opportunities organised 
as part of ESCB programmes or offered by the 
NCBs. In the context of its secondary training policy, the ECB provided 22 members of staff with 
support to acquire a qualiÞ cation that would 
increase their professional competence beyond 
the requirements of their current position. RECRUITMENTExternal recruitment to Þ ll permanent positions 
was carried out on the basis of Þ xed-term contracts of Þ ve years for managerial positions 
and three years for other positions. Fixed-term 
contracts offered for permanent positions may 
be converted into unlimited contracts, subject 
to a review procedure that takes into account 
organisational considerations and individual 
performance. In 2007 the ECB offered 
27 convertible Þ xed-term contracts to external 
applicants. It also issued 56 non-convertible 
Þ xed-term contracts to cover for staff 
absences of more than one year and 114 short-
term contracts to cover for absences of 
less than one year, such as unpaid or parental leave. The following table summarises 
developments in the stafÞ ng of the ECB 
in 2007.Offering short-term contracts to staff from NCBs and international organisations allows 
the ECB and these organisations to gain from 
each other™s experience. Employing NCB staff 
on a short-term basis also helps to foster an 
ESCB-wide team spirit.In September 2007 the second intake of participants in the ECB™s Graduate Programme, 
which is aimed at recent graduates with a broad 
educational background, joined the Bank on the 
basis of two-year non-convertible contracts.The internship opportunities offered by the ECB focused on students and graduates with 
backgrounds in economics, statistics, business 
administration, law and translation.The ECB also offered Þ ve fellowships as part 
of the Wim Duisenberg Research Fellowship Programme, which is open to leading 
economists, and Þ ve fellowships to young 
researchers in the context of its Lamfalussy 
Fellowship Programme. EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONSThe ECB has started an ambitious project 
which aims to introduce an enterprise resource 
planning system. The SAP-based system called 
ﬁISISﬂ (Integrated data, Streamlined processes, 
Information Sharing), once operational, will 
have a signiÞ cant impact on a number of 
tasks relating to HR management. As well as 
simplifying various administrative processes, 
the system will allow staff and managers to 
perform some activities in ﬁself-service modeﬂ, 
thus contributing to increased efÞ ciency within 
the organisation.Taking into account the most recent developments regarding life expectancy, the 
ECB has initiated a review of the retirement 
plan it offers to its staff. It is expected that the 
outcome of this review will be implemented at 
the beginning of 2009.Staffing developments20072006

2007In order to improve the balance between professional and private life, and to further 
develop the resilience of the ECB, the Executive 
Board decided to launch a pilot project with a 
view to progressively introducing teleworking. 
After completion of the project, the beneÞ ts and 
drawbacks will be carefully assessed before a 
decision is taken on extending the scheme.THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE 

AND THE FOLLOW-UP TO THE EUROSYSTEM 

MISSION STATEMENTThe Human Resources Conference (HRC) was 
established in 2005, with the aim of further 
promoting cooperation and team spirit among 
Eurosystem/ESCB central banks in the Þ eld of HR management. The HRC™s activities in 
2007 covered different aspects of staff training 
and development, including opportunities for 
ESCB training activities and the development of 
measures to increase intra-ESCB mobility.With the aim of exchanging experiences and moving towards the establishment of best 
practices, workshops and presentations were 
organised on topics such as recruitment and selection procedures, assessment centres, 
internal mobility and career path policies. A 
conference on leading organisational change 
also took place, and a new task force on ESCB 
human resources management information was 
launched.2.2 NEW ECB PREMISES
Work on the ECB™s new premises progressed 
according to schedule in 2007. The detailed 
planning phase started on 20 February 2007 
and the results of this phase were presented to 
the public on 8 October 2007. The design was 
submitted to the relevant authorities of the City 
of Frankfurt on 22 October 2007 in order to 
obtain the necessary building permits.While the overall appearance of the building 
ensemble remained unchanged as a result of the 

detailed planning phase, the design for the new 

premises was further developed. On-site analyses 

of original building elements and materials used in 

the Grossmarkthalle were conducted with a view 

to developing appropriate methods of restoration. 
204ECBAnnual Report
2007The speciÞ cs of the construction envisaged inside 
the Grossmarkthalle were elaborated in further 
detail, especially with regard to Þ re and safety 
requirements, as well as the structural elements 

of the functional areas within the hall.The overall concept for the interior of the new premises, including the materials and surfaces, 
was deÞ ned. Sample installations were built to 
test the functionality and quality of the materials 
chosen for the main building elements. An 
actual-size, two-storey mock-up building, 
showing the facade of a middle section of the 
high-rise south ofÞ ce tower and the adjacent 
atrium, has been installed at the ECB™s future 
site in order to verify the technical, functional 
and architectural details.In 2007 the land use plan was further developed by the planning department of the City of 
Frankfurt, in cooperation with the ECB. The 
purpose of the land use plan is to ascertain 
sustainable urban development. The general 
public and various authorities are involved in 
the development of the plan, thereby ensuring 
its democratic legitimacy. The land use plan was 
published in the ﬁAmtsblattﬂ, the ofÞ cial gazette 
of the City of Frankfurt, on 13 November 2007, 
rendering it legally binding. In August 2007 the ECB launched an international public tender for a general 
contractor to construct its new premises. The 
contract notice was published both in the 
OfÞ cial Journal of the European Union and 
on the ECB™s website. It is envisaged that the 
contract will be awarded in October 2008, with 
the main construction work scheduled to begin 
in the fourth quarter of 2008. Preliminary work 
on the ECB™s future site will begin in the Þ rst quarter of 2008. The new premises are expected 
to be Þ nalised by the end of 2011.
In 2008 the City of Frankfurt will launch a 
competition to design a memorial and information 
space to commemorate the deportation of Jewish 
citizens from the Grossmarkthalle.2.3 THE EUROSYSTEM PROCUREMENT 
COORDINATION OFFICEIn July 2007 the Governing Council decided 
to establish the Eurosystem Procurement 
Coordination OfÞ ce (EPCO) in order to enhance 
cooperation within the Eurosystem in the Þ eld of procurement. The main tasks of EPCO are 
to facilitate the adoption and exchange of best 
practices within the Eurosystem, to develop 
an infrastructure (skills, functional tools and 
IT processes) enabling purchasing power to 
be pooled, and to coordinate the Eurosystem 
procurement agenda. Eurosystem central banks 
participate on a voluntary basis. In December 
2007 the Banque centrale du Luxembourg was 
designated to host EPCO from 1 January 2008 
to 31 December 2012.205ECBAnnual Report
20073 ESCB SOCIAL DIALOGUE
The ESCB Social Dialogue is a consultative forum involving the ECB and employee 
representatives from the central banks of the 
ESCB and from European trade union 
federations. 14 Its purpose is to provide information and foster exchanges of views on 
issues that may have a major impact on 
employment conditions at the central banks of 
the ESCB. Meetings of the ESCB Social Dialogue were held in July and December 2007. In addition 
to issues relating to banknote production and 
circulation, payment systems (TARGET2, 
TARGET2-Securities and CCBM2) and 
Þ nancial supervision, discussions dealt with 
the implementation of the measures related to 
the Eurosystem mission statement, strategic 
intents and organisational principles and with 
their implications for the day-to-day work of 
Eurosystem staff. The employee representatives 
were also informed of the work being carried 
out by the HRC. The ECB continued to issue a biannual newsletter to keep employee representatives 
informed of the latest developments with regard 
to the above topics. The implementation of the measures agreed in 2006 between the ECB and the European trade 
union federations to enhance further the ESCB 
Social Dialogue was initiated in 2007 and will 
be pursued in 2008. The Standing Committee of European Central Bank Unions 14 (SCECBU), Union Network International Œ Europa (UNI Œ Europa) Finance and the European Federation of Public Service

207ECB Annual Report20071 NATURE OF THE BUSINESS
The ECB™s activities in 2007 are described in detail in the relevant chapters of the Annual 
Report.2 OBJECTIVES AND TASKS
The ECB™s objectives and tasks are described in 
the Statute of the ESCB (Articles 2 and 3). An 
overview of these objectives is included in the 
President™s foreword to the Annual Report. 3 KEY RESOURCES, RISKS AND PROCESSES
GOVERNANCE OF THE ECBInformation relating to the governance of the ECB is given in Chapter 8. MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARDThe members of the Executive Board are 
appointed from among persons of recognised 
standing and professional experience in 
monetary or banking matters by common accord 
of the governments of the Member States at the 
level of the Heads of State or Government, upon 
a recommendation from the EU Council after it 
has consulted the European Parliament and the 
Governing Council. The terms and conditions of members™ employment are determined by the Governing 
Council, based on a proposal from a Committee 
comprising three members appointed by 
the Governing Council and three members 
appointed by the EU Council.The emoluments of the members of the Executive Board are set out in note 29 ﬁStaff 
costsﬂ of the Annual Accounts.EMPLOYEESThe average number of staff (full-time 
equivalent) employed on permanent or Þ xed-term contracts by the ECB rose from 1,337 in 
2006 to 1,366 in 2007. At the end of that year 
1,375 staff were employed. For further details, 
see note 29 ﬁStaff costsﬂ of the Annual Accounts 
and Chapter 8, Section 2, which also describes 
the ECB™s human resources strategy.INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserves portfolio consists of 
foreign reserve assets transferred to it by the euro 
area NCBs in accordance with the provisions of 
Article 30 of the Statute of the European System 
of Central Banks and of the European Central 
Bank, and the income thereon. It serves to fund 
the ECB™s operations in the foreign exchange 
market for the purposes set out in the Treaty.The ECB™s own funds portfolio reß ects the 
investment of its paid-up capital, the counterpart of the provision against foreign exchange, 
interest rate and gold price risks, the general 
reserve fund and income accumulated on the 
portfolio in the past. Its purpose is to provide the 
ECB with income to contribute to the coverage 
of its operating expenses.The ECB™s investment activities and its management of the associated risks are described 
in greater detail in Chapter 2.THE BUDGET PROCESSThe Budget Committee (BUCOM), composed 
of ECB and euro area NCB experts, is 
a key contributor to the ECB™s Þ nancial governance process. In accordance with 
Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure, BUCOM 
supports the Governing Council by providing a 
detailed evaluation of annual ECB budget 
proposals and requests for supplementary 
budget funding by the Executive Board, prior 
to their submission to the Governing Council 
for approval. Spending against agreed budgets 
is monitored regularly by the Executive 
Board, taking into account the advice of the 
ECB™s internal controlling function, and by 
the Governing Council with the assistance 
of BUCOM.MANAGEMENT REPORT FOR THE YEARENDING 31 DECEMBER 2007208ECB Annual Report20074 FINANCIAL RESULT 
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTSUnder Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 
by the Executive Board, in accordance with 
the principles established by the Governing 
Council. The accounts are then approved 
by the Governing Council and subsequently 
published.PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, 

INTEREST RATE AND GOLD PRICE RISKS 
Since most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities are 

periodically revalued at current market exchange 

rates and security prices, the ECB™s proÞ tability 
is strongly affected by exchange rate exposures 

and, to a lesser extent, interest rate exposures. 

These exposures stem mainly from its holdings 

of foreign reserve assets held in US dollars, 

Japanese yen and gold, which are predominantly 

invested in interest-bearing instruments. 
In 2005, taking into account the ECB™s large exposure to these risks and the size of its 
revaluation accounts, the Governing Council 
decided to establish a provision against foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate and gold price 
risks. As at 31 December 2006, this provision 
amounted to •2,371,395,162. In accordance 
with Article 49.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
Banka Slovenije also contributed an amount of 
•10,947,042 to the provision with effect from 1 
January 2007. Taking the results of its assessment 
into account, the Governing Council decided to 
transfer as at 31 December 2007 an additional 
amount of •286,416,109 to the provision, which 
increased its size to •2,668,758,313 and, as in 
2006, reduced net proÞ t to exactly zero. 
This provision will be used to cover realised 
and unrealised losses, in particular valuation 
losses not covered by the revaluation accounts. 
Its size and continuing requirement is reviewed 
annually, taking a range of factors into account, 
including in particular the level of holdings of 
risk-bearing assets, the extent of materialised risk exposures in the current Þ nancial year, 
projected results for the coming year, and a risk 
assessment involving calculations of Values 
at Risk (VaR) on risk-bearing assets, which is 
applied consistently over time. The Governing 
Council has decided that the provision, together 
with any amounts held in the ECB™s general 
reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the 
capital shares paid up by the euro area NCBs.FINANCIAL RESULT FOR 2007Had the provision against foreign exchange 
rate, interest rate and gold price risks not been 
increased in 2007, the ECB would have reported 
a net proÞ t of •286 million. 
In 2007, the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis 
the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese 
yen resulted in write-downs in the euro value of 
the ECB™s holdings of assets denominated in 
these currencies. These write-downs amounted 
to some •2.5 billion and were expensed in the 
ProÞ t and Loss Account. 
In 2007 net interest income increased to •2,421 
million from •1,972 million in 2006, owing 
mainly to an increase in euro banknotes in 
circulation and in the marginal rate for the 
Eurosystem™s main reÞ nancing operations, 
which determines the remuneration that the 
ECB receives on its share of euro banknotes in 
the Eurosystem.Net realised gains arising from Þ nancial 
operations rose from •475 million in 2006 to •779 
million in 2007, mainly due to (a) the drop in US 

interest rates in 2007 which resulted in higher net 

realised gains from security sales during the year 

and (b) the rise in the price of gold, which led to 

greater realised gains from gold sales in 2007. 

These sales were conducted in accordance with 

the Central Bank Gold Agreement, which came 

into effect on 27 September 2004 and of which 

the ECB is a signatory.Total administrative expenses of the ECB, including depreciation, increased from •361 
million in 2006 to •385 million in 2007. 209ECB Annual Report2007CHANGE TO THE CAPITAL OF THE ECBIn accordance with Article 49.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, which was added to the Statute by 
the Treaty of Accession, the ECB™s subscribed 
capital is automatically increased when a new 
Member State joins the EU and its NCB joins 
the ESCB. This increase requires the calculation 
of the capital key weighting of each NCB that 
is part of the ESCB by analogy with Article 
29.1 and in compliance with Article 29.2 of 
the Statute of the ESCB. Consequently, upon 
the accession of Bulgaria and Romania as 
new Member States as at 1 January 2007 (a) 
the NCBs™ capital key shares were adjusted in 
accordance with Council Decision 2003/517/EC 
of 15 July 2003 on the statistical data to be used 
for the adjustment of the key for subscription to 
the capital of the European Central Bank and (b) 
the subscribed capital of the ECB was increased 
to •5,761 million. In addition, in accordance with Article 49.1 of the 
Statute of the ESCB, Banka Slovenije paid up the 

remainder of its capital subscription to the ECB 

upon Slovenia™s adoption of the single currency 

as at 1 January 2007, while the Bulgarian National 

Bank and Banca Naional a României, similarly 
to the other non-euro area NCBs, paid up 7% of 

their subscribed capital as a contribution to the 

operational costs of the ECB.The combined effect of the developments described was that the ECB™s paid-up capital 
increased from •4,089 million on 31 December 
2006 to •4,127 million on 1 January 2007.

00Frankfurt am Main, 26 February 2008EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKJean-Claude TrichetPresidentPROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 
31 DECEMBER 2007213ECB Annual Report2007FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTSThe Þ nancial statements of the European 
Central Bank (ECB) have been designed to 
present fairly the Þ nancial position of the ECB 
and the results of its operations. They have 
been drawn up in accordance with the following 
accounting policies 2, which the Governing Council considers to be appropriate to the nature 
of central bank activity. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been 
applied: economic reality and transparency, 
prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet 
events, materiality, the accruals principle, going 
concern, consistency and comparability.RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAn asset or liability is only recognised in the 

Balance Sheet when it is probable that any 

associated future economic beneÞ t will 
ß ow to or 
from the ECB, substantially all of the associated 

risks and rewards have been transferred to the ECB, 

and the cost or value of the asset or the amount of 

the obligation can be measured reliably.BASIS OF ACCOUNTINGThe accounts have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis, modiÞ ed to include market valuation of marketable securities, gold and all other on-
balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency. 
Transactions in Þ nancial assets and liabilities 
are reß ected in the accounts on the basis of the 
date on which they are settled. With effect from 1 January 2007, the basis for recording foreign exchange transactions, 
Þ nancial instruments denominated in foreign 
currency and related accruals in the accounts 
of Eurosystem central banks has changed. 
Early application was permitted, and the ECB 
introduced the change as at 1 October 2006, 
with the following effects. With the exception of securities, transactions are now recorded in 
off-balance-sheet accounts on the trade date. At 
settlement date the off-balance-sheet entries are 
reversed and transactions are booked on-balance-
sheet. Purchases and sales of foreign currency 
affect the net foreign currency position on the 
trade date, rather than on the spot settlement 
date as was the case hitherto, and realised results 
arising from sales are also calculated on the trade 
date. Accrued interest, premiums and discounts 
related to Þ nancial instruments denominated in 
foreign currency are calculated and recorded 
daily, and the foreign currency position is also 
affected daily by these accruals instead of 
changing only when interest cash ß ows actually 
occur, as was the case previously. GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND 

LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency are converted into euro at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet 
date. Income and expenses are converted at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. 
The revaluation of foreign exchange assets and 
liabilities, including on-balance-sheet and off-
balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a 
currency-by-currency basis.Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
is treated separately from the exchange rate 
revaluation. Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the year-end. No distinction is made between 
the price and currency revaluation differences 
for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is 
accounted for on the basis of the price in euro 
per Þ ne ounce of gold, which, for the year 
ending 31 December 2007, was derived from ACCOUNTING POLICIES1The detailed accounting policies of the ECB were laid down in 1 Decision ECB/2002/11, OJ L 58, 3.3.2003, p. 38, as amended. With effect from 1 January 2007, this Decision was repealed 
and replaced by Decision ECB/2006/17, OJ L 348, 11.12.2006,
p. 38, as amended.
These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 2 of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach 
to the rules governing the accounting and Þ nancial reporting of 
Eurosystem operations.214ECB Annual Report2007the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar on 31 December 2007.SECURITIES  
All marketable securities and similar assets are 
valued either at the mid-market prices or on the 
basis of the relevant yield curve prevailing at 
the Balance Sheet date on a security-by-security 
basis. For the year ending 31 December 2007, 
mid-market prices on 28 December 2007 were 
used. Non-marketable securities are valued at 
cost, while illiquid equity shares are valued at 
cost subject to impairment.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the 
period in which they are earned or incurred. 
Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of 
foreign exchange, gold and securities are taken 
to the ProÞ t and Loss Account. Such realised 
gains and losses are calculated by reference to 
the average cost of the respective asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income but are transferred directly to a revaluation 
account.Unrealised losses are taken to the ProÞ t and Loss 
Account if they exceed previous revaluation gains registered in the corresponding revaluation 
account. Unrealised losses in any one security, 
currency or in gold are not netted against 
unrealised gains in other securities, currencies 
or gold. In the event of an unrealised loss on 
any item at the year-end, the average cost of that 
item is reduced to the year-end exchange rate 
and/or market price.Premiums or discounts arising on purchased securities are calculated and presented as part 
of interest income and are amortised over the 
remaining life of the assets.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby 
the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against 
collateral.Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement 
to repurchase them from the counterparty at an 
agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase 
agreements are recorded as collateralised inward 
deposits on the liability side of the Balance 
Sheet and also lead to an interest expense in the 
ProÞ t and Loss Account. Securities sold under 
such an agreement remain on the Balance Sheet 
of the ECB. Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous 
agreement to sell them back to the counterparty 
at an agreed price on a set future date. 
Reverse repurchase agreements are recorded 
as collateralised loans on the asset side of the 
Balance Sheet but are not included in the ECB™s 
security holdings. They give rise to interest 
income in the ProÞ t and Loss Account.
Reverse transactions (including security lending 
transactions) conducted under an automated 
security lending programme are recorded on the 
Balance Sheet only where collateral is provided 
to the ECB in the form of cash over the maturity 
of the transaction. In 2007 the ECB did not 
receive any collateral in the form of cash over 
the maturity of such transactions.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange 
forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 
exchange swaps and other currency instruments 
involving an exchange of one currency for 
another at a future date, are included in the net 
foreign currency position for the purpose of 
calculating foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation 
margin of open interest rate futures contracts 
are recorded in the ProÞ t and Loss Account. The 
valuation of forward transactions in securities 
and of interest rate swaps is based on generally 215ECB Annual Report2007accepted valuation methods using observable market prices and rates and the discount factors 
from the settlement dates to the valuation date. POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTSAssets and liabilities are adjusted for events that 
occur between the annual Balance Sheet date 
and the date on which the Governing Council 
approves the Þ nancial statements, if such events 
materially affect the condition of assets and 
liabilities at the Balance Sheet date. INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM 

BALANCESIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-border 
transactions that occur between two EU 
central banks. These transactions are processed 
primarily via TARGET/TARGET2 Œ the Trans-
European Automated Real-time Gross settlement 
Express Transfer system (see Chapter 2) Œ and 
give rise to bilateral balances in accounts held 
between those EU central banks connected to 
TARGET/TARGET2. These bilateral balances 
are then assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, 
leaving each NCB with a single net bilateral 
position vis-à-vis the ECB only. This position 
in the books of the ECB represents the net 
claim or liability of each NCB against the rest 
of the ESCB. Intra-ESCB balances of the euro area NCBs with the ECB (except for the capital of the ECB 
and positions resulting from the transfer of 
foreign reserve assets to the ECB) are described 
as intra-Eurosystem claims or liabilities and are 
presented in the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a 
single net asset or liability position. Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem are included as a single net asset 
under ﬁClaims related to the allocation of 
euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see 
ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).Intra-ESCB balances of non-euro area NCBs 
with the ECB, arising from their participation in 
TARGET/TARGET2, 3 are disclosed under ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residents 
denominated in euroﬂ. TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETSFixed assets, with the exception of land, 
are valued at cost less depreciation. Land is 
valued at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a 
straight-line basis, beginning in the quarter after 
acquisition and continuing over the period for 
which the asset is expected to be available for 
use, as follows:The depreciation period for capitalised building and refurbishment expenditure relating to the 
ECB™s existing premises has been reduced in 
order to ensure that these assets are completely 
written off before the ECB moves to its new 
premises. THE ECB’S RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER POST-
EMPLOYMENT BENEFITSThe ECB operates a deÞ ned bene
Þ t scheme for 
its staff. This is funded by assets held in a long-
term employee-beneÞ t fund. 
BALANCE SHEETThe liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in 
respect of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t plans is the present 
value of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation at the 
Balance Sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets used to fund the obligation, adjusted for 
unrecognised actuarial gains or losses. As at 31 December 2007, the non-euro area NCBs participating 3 in TARGET/TARGET2 were: Danmarks Nationalbank, Central Bank of Cyprus, Latvijas Banka, Lietuvos bankas, Central Bank 
of Malta and Bank of England. Computers, related hardware and 
software, and motor vehicles 4 yearsEquipment, furniture and plant in 
building 10 yearsFixed assets costing less than •10,000Written off in the 
year of acquisition216ECB Annual Report2007The deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash ß ows, using interest rates of high-quality corporate 
bonds that are denominated in euro and have 
similar terms of maturity to the term of the 
related pension liability.Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience adjustments (where actual outcomes 
are different from the actuarial assumptions 
previously made) and changes in actuarial 
assumptions.PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNTThe net amount charged to the ProÞ t and Loss 
Account comprises: (a) the current service cost of the bene
Þ ts accruing for the year; (b) interest at the discount rate on the de
Þ ned beneÞ t obligation;
(c) the expected return on the plan assets; and 

(d) any actuarial gains and losses recognised in 
the ProÞ t and Loss Account, using a ﬁ10% 
corridorﬂ approach.“10% CORRIDOR” APPROACHNet cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses which exceed the greater of (a) 10% of the 
present value of the deÞ ned bene
Þ t obligation 
and (b) 10% of the fair value of plan assets, 
are to be amortised over the expected average 
remaining working lives of the participating 
employees. PENSIONS OF EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS AND 

OTHER POST-RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
Unfunded arrangements are in place for the 
pensions of members of the Executive Board and 
disability beneÞ t provisions for the staff. The 
expected costs of these beneÞ ts are accrued over 
the Executive Board/staff members™ terms of 
ofÞ ce/employment using an accounting approach 
similar to that of deÞ ned bene
Þ t pension plans. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the 
same manner as outlined above. These obligations are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the appropriate 
liability in the Þ nancial statements.
BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONThe ECB and the euro area NCBs, which 
together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro 
banknotes. 4 The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem central 
banks on the last working day of each month in 
accordance with the banknote allocation key.5 The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of 
the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, 
which is disclosed under the Balance Sheet 
liability item ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ. The 
ECB™s share of the total euro banknote issue is 
backed by claims on the NCBs. These claims, 
which bear interest,6 are disclosed under the sub-item ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claims: claims related 
to the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/
intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). Interest income on these 
claims is included within the item ﬁNet interest 
incomeﬂ. This income is due to the NCBs in the 
Þ nancial year in which it accrues, but is to be 
distributed on the second working day of the 
following year.7 It is distributed in full unless Decision ECB/2001/15 of 6 December 2001 on the issue of euro 4 banknotes, OJ L 337, 20.12.2001, p. 52, as amended.ﬁBanknote allocation keyﬂ means the percentages that result from 5 taking into account the ECB™s share in the total euro banknote 
issue and applying the subscribed capital key to the NCBs™ share 
in that total. 
Decision ECB/2001/16 of 6 December 2001 on the allocation of 6 monetary income of the national central banks of participating 
Member States from the Þ nancial year 2002, OJ L 337, 
20.12.2001, p. 55, as amended.
Decision ECB/2005/11 of 17 November 2005 on the distribution 7 of the income of the European Central Bank on euro banknotes 
in circulation to the national central banks of the participating 
Member States, OJ L 311, 26.11.2005, p. 41. This Decision 
repealed Decision ECB/2002/9.  217ECB Annual Report2007the ECB™s net proÞ t for the year is less than its 
income earned on euro banknotes in circulation and subject to any decisions by the Governing 
Council to make transfers to a provision for 
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 
price risks and to charge costs incurred by the 
ECB in connection with the issue and handling 
of euro banknotes against this income.OTHER ISSUESTaking account of the ECB™s role as a central 
bank, the Executive Board considers that the 
publication of a cash ß ow statement would not 
provide the readers of the Þ nancial statements 
with any additional relevant information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB, and on the basis of a recommendation 
of the Governing Council, the EU Council has 
approved the appointment of KPMG Deutsche 
Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft Wirt-
schaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the external 
auditors of the ECB for a Þ ve-year period up to 
the end of the Þ nancial year 2007.
218ECB Annual Report2007NOTES ON THE BALANCE SHEET1 GOLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLES 
As at 31 December 2007 the ECB held18,091,733 ounces of Þ ne gold (2006: 
20,572,017 ounces). The reduction was due to 
(a) gold sales of 2,539,839 ounces in accordance 
with the Central Bank Gold Agreement, which 
came into effect on 27 September 2004 and of 
which the ECB is a signatory, and (b) Banka 
Slovenije™s transfer to the ECB of 59,555 ounces 
of Þ ne gold
 8 upon Slovenia™s adoption of the single currency, in accordance with Article 30.1 
of the Statute of the ESCB. The decrease in the 
euro equivalent of this holding, resulting from 
these transactions, was more than offset by a 
signiÞ cant rise in the price of gold during 2007 
(see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and 
liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).2 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO 
AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN 

CURRENCYRECEIVABLES FROM THE IMF 
This asset represents the ECB™s holdings 

of special drawing rights (SDRs) as at 

31 December 2007. It arises as the result of a 

two-way SDR buying and selling arrangement 

with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 

whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange 

sales or purchases of SDRs against euro, 

on behalf of the ECB, within minimum and 

maximum holding levels. The SDR is deÞ ned 
in terms of a basket of currencies. Its value 

is determined as the weighted sum of the 

exchange rates of four major currencies (euro, 

Japanese yen, pound sterling and US dollar). 

For accounting purposes, SDRs are treated 

as a foreign currency (see ﬁGold and foreign 

currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies). 
BALANCES WITH BANKS AND SECURITY 

INVESTMENTS, EXTERNAL LOANS AND OTHER 

EXTERNAL ASSETS; AND CLAIMS ON EURO AREA 

RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY 
These two items consist of balances with banks 
and loans denominated in foreign currency, and 
investments in securities denominated in US 
dollars and Japanese yen, as follows:Despite the depreciation of both the US dollar and the Japanese yen against the euro in 2007, 
the net euro value of these positions increased, 
mainly as a result of (a) the investment of the 
proceeds of the gold sales in Japanese yen and 
to a lesser extent in the US dollar portfolio 
(see note 1, ﬁGold and gold receivablesﬂ) and 
(b) income received primarily in the US dollar 
portfolio. Additionally, upon Slovenia™s adoption of the single currency with effect from 1 January 2007, 
Banka Slovenije transferred US dollars with 
a value of •162.9 million to the ECB, in 
accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statute of 
the ESCB. The transfer, with a value equivalent to •28.7 million, was made 8 with effect from 1 January 2007.Claims on non-euro area

219ECB Annual Report2007The ECB™s net foreign currency holdings 9 of US dollars and Japanese yen, as at 31 December 2007, were as follows: 3 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO 
As at 31 December 2007 this claim consisted 
of money market deposits with a value of 
•20.0 million and current accounts with non-
euro area residents.4 OTHER CLAIMS ON EURO AREA CREDIT 
INSTITUTIONS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
As at 31 December 2007 this claim consisted 
of money market deposits with a value of 
•100.0 million and current accounts with euro 
area residents.5 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM CLAIMS 
CLAIMS RELATED TO THE ALLOCATION OF EURO 
BANKNOTES WITHIN THE EUROSYSTEM 
This item consists of the claims of the ECB 
vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs relating to 
the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in 
the notes on accounting policies).OTHER CLAIMS WITHIN THE EUROSYSTEM (NET)This item consists of the TARGET/TARGET2 
balances of the euro area NCBs vis-à-vis 
the ECB (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/intra-
Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on accounting 
policies). The increase in this position is due 
mainly to the settlement of the euro leg of the 
back-to-back swap transactions conducted with 
NCBs in connection with the US dollar Term 
Auction Facility (see note 9, ﬁLiabilities to non-
euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ).6 OTHER ASSETS
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETSThese assets comprised the following main items on 31 December 2007:Assets minus liabilities denominated in the respective foreign 9 currency that are subject to foreign currency revaluation. These are included under the headings ﬁClaims on non-euro 
area residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, ﬁClaims 
on euro area residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, 
ﬁAccruals and prepaid expensesﬂ, ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area 
residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, ﬁOff-balance-
sheet instruments revaluation differencesﬂ (Liabilities side) and 
ﬁAccruals and income collected in advanceﬂ, also taking into 
account foreign exchange forward and swap transactions under 
off-balance-sheet items. The effects of the price revaluation

220ECB Annual Report2007The decrease in ﬁLand and buildingsﬂ at cost is due mainly to the sale in January 2007 of the 
ofÞ cial residence for Presidents of the ECB 
purchased in 2001. A new ofÞ cial residence was 
acquired in December 2006. The increase in the category ﬁAssets under constructionﬂ is due mainly to initial works 
related to the ECB™s new premises. Transfers 
from this category to the relevant Þ xed asset 
headings will occur once the assets are in use.OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETSThe main components of this item are as 
follows:(a) Securities denominated in euro and reverse 
repurchase agreements in euro constitute the investment of the ECB™s own funds (see 
note 12, ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ). The increase 
in securities held was due mainly to the 
investment in the own funds portfolio of the 
counterpart of the amount transferred to the 
ECB™s provision against foreign exchange, 
interest rate and gold price risks in 2006.(b) The ECB holds 3,211 shares in the BIS, 
which are included at the acquisition cost of 
•41.8 million.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION 

DIFFERENCES 
This item is composed mainly of valuation 
changes in swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2007 (see note 21, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These valuation changes are the result of the 
conversion of such transactions into their euro 
equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the Balance Sheet date, compared with the 
euro values resulting from the conversion of the 
transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency (see ﬁGold and foreign 
currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies). Valuation gains in forward 
transactions in securities are also included in 
this item. ACCRUALS AND PREPAID EXPENSESIn 2007, this position included accrued interest 
receivable on the ECB™s claims related to 
the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem for the Þ nal quarter (see ﬁBanknotes 
in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting 
policies) amounting to •545.8 million, and 
accrued interest receivable on the TARGET/
TARGET2 balances due from euro area NCBs 
for the Þ nal month of 2007 amounting to 
•481.6 million. Also included under this item is accrued interest, including the amortisation of discounts, on 
securities and other Þ nancial assets.
SUNDRY 
This item consists mainly of balances 
related to swap and forward transactions in 
foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2007 (see note 21, ﬁForeign

Balance Sheet date, compared with the euro 
values at which the transactions are initially 
recorded (see ﬁOff-balance-sheet instrumentsﬂ 
in the notes on accounting policies).This item also includes a claim against the German Federal Ministry of Finance in respect 
of recoverable value added tax and other 
indirect taxes paid. Such taxes are refundable 
under the terms of Article 3 of the Protocol on 
the privileges and immunities of the European 
Communities, which applies to the ECB by 
virtue of Article 40 of the Statute of the ESCB. 7 BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION 
This item consists of the ECB™s share (8%) 
of the total euro banknotes in circulation (see 
ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).8 LIABILITIES TO OTHER EURO AREA 
RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
This item comprises deposits by members of 
the Euro Banking Association (EBA) which are 
used in order to provide the ECB with collateral 
in respect of the EBA™s payments settled through 
the TARGET/TARGET2 system.9 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO 
This item consists mainly of a liability to the 
Federal Reserve amounting to •13.9 billion in 
connection with the US dollar Term Auction 
Facility. Under this programme, USD 20 billion 
were provided by the Federal Reserve to the ECB 
by means of a temporary reciprocal currency 
arrangement (swap line), with the aim of offering 
short-term US dollar funding to Eurosystem 
counterparties. The ECB simultaneously entered 
into back-to-back swap transactions with NCBs 
that have adopted the euro, which used the resulting funds to conduct liquidity-providing 
operations with the Eurosystem counterparties. 
These back-to-back swap transactions resulted 
in non-remunerated intra-Eurosystem balances 
between the ECB and the NCBs reported under 
ﬁOther claims within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ.The remainder of this item reß ects balances 
held at the ECB by non-euro area NCBs arising from transactions processed via the TARGET/
TARGET2 system (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/
intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).10 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY 
This position consists of repurchase agreements 
conducted with non-euro area residents in 
connection with the management of the foreign 
currency reserves of the ECB.11 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM LIABILITIES 
These represent the liabilities to the euro area 
NCBs that arose from the transfer of foreign 
reserve assets to the ECB when they joined the 
Eurosystem. They are remunerated at the latest 
available marginal rate for the Eurosystem™s 
main reÞ nancing operations, adjusted to re
ß ect a 
zero return on the gold component (see note 23, 
ﬁNet interest incomeﬂ). The enlargement of the EU through the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the concomitant 
adjustment of the total limit of NCBs™ claims 
and weightings in the ECB™s capital key (see 
note 15, ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ), along with 
Banka Slovenije™s transfer of foreign reserve 
assets upon Slovenia™s adoption of the single 
currency, led to an increase of these liabilities 
by •259,568,376.222ECB Annual Report2007Banka Slovenije™s claim was set at •183,995,238 
in order to ensure that the ratio between that claim 

and the aggregate claim credited to the other 

NCBs that have adopted the euro will be equal to 

the ratio between Banka Slovenije™s weighting in 

the ECB™s capital key and the other participating 

NCBs™ aggregate weighting in this key. The 

difference between the claim and the value of 

the assets transferred (see notes 1 ﬁGold and gold 

receivablesﬂ and 2 ﬁClaims on non-euro area 

and euro area residents denominated in foreign 

currencyﬂ) was treated as part of the contributions 

of Banka Slovenije, due under Article 49.2 of the 

Statute of the ESCB, to the reserves and provisions 

equivalent to reserves of the ECB existing as at 31 

December 2006 (see notes 13 ﬁProvisionsﬂ and 14 

ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ).12 OTHER LIABILITIES
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS REVALUATION 
DIFFERENCES 
This item is composed mainly of valuation 
changes in swap and forward transactions in foreign currency that were outstanding on 
31 December 2007 (see note 21, ﬁForeign 
exchange swap and forward transactionsﬂ). 
These valuation changes are the result of the 
conversion of such transactions into their euro 
equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the Balance Sheet date, compared with the 
euro values resulting from the conversion of the 
transactions at the average cost of the respective 
foreign currency (see ﬁGold and foreign currency 
assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 
policies and also note 6, ﬁOther assetsﬂ).Valuation losses in forward transactions in securities and interest rate swaps are also 
included in this item. ACCRUALS AND INCOME COLLECTED IN ADVANCE 
This item consists mainly of interest payable 
to the NCBs in respect of their claims relating 
to the foreign reserves transferred (see note 11, 
ﬁIntra-Eurosystem liabilitiesﬂ), amounting to •1.4 billion. Also included within this balance 
are accruals on balances due to NCBs in respect 
of TARGET/TARGET2, accruals on Þ nancial instruments, including the amortisation of 
coupon bond premiums, and other accruals. SUNDRY 
This item consists mainly of outstanding 
repurchase transactions of •517 million 
conducted in connection with the management 
of the ECB™s own funds (see note 6, ﬁOther 
assetsﬂ) and the net liability in respect of the 
ECB™s pension obligations as described below.THE ECB’S RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER

224ECB Annual Report200713 PROVISIONS 
As at 31 December 2005, taking into account the ECB™s large exposure to foreign exchange 
rate, interest rate and gold price risks, and the 
size of its revaluation accounts, the Governing 
Council deemed it appropriate to establish a 
provision against these risks. This provision will 
be used to fund future realised and unrealised 
losses, in particular valuation losses not covered 
by the revaluation accounts. The size and 
continuing requirement for this provision is 
reviewed annually, based on the ECB™s 
assessment of its exposure to the above risks. 
This assessment takes a range of factors into 
account, including in particular the level of 
holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent of 
materialised risk exposures in the current 
Þ nancial year, projected results for the coming 
year, and a risk assessment involving 
calculations of Values at Risk (VaR) on risk-
bearing assets, which is applied consistently 
over time.10 The provision, together with any amount held in the general reserve fund, may 
not exceed the value of the ECB™s capital paid 
up by the euro area NCBs.As at 31 December 2006, the provision against foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 
price risks amounted to •2,371,395,162. In 
accordance with Article 49.2 of the Statute of 
the ESCB, Banka Slovenije also contributed 
an amount of •10,947,042 to the provision 
with effect from 1 January 2007. Taking the 
results of its assessment into account, the 
Governing Council decided to transfer, as at 
31 December 2007, an additional amount of 
•286,416,109 to the provision, which increased 
its size to •2,668,758,313 and, as in 2006, 
reduced net proÞ t to exactly zero. 
This item also includes an appropriate provision 
against the contractual obligation of the ECB 
to restore its current premises to their original 
condition when they are vacated and the ECB 
moves to its Þ nal site, and other miscellaneous 
provisions. 14 REVALUATION ACCOUNTS 
These accounts represent revaluation balances 
arising from unrealised gains on assets and 
liabilities. In accordance with Article 49.2 
of the Statute of the ESCB, Banka Slovenije 
contributed an amount of •26 million to these 
balances with effect from 1 January 2007.The foreign exchange rates used for the year-end revaluation were as follows:15 CAPITAL AND RESERVES 
CAPITAL
(A) CHANGE TO THE ECB’S CAPITAL KEYPursuant to Article 29 of the Statute of the ESCB, the shares of the NCBs in the ECB™s 
capital key are weighted according to the 
shares of the respective Member States in 
the EU™s total population and GDP in equal 
measure, as notiÞ ed to the ECB by the European 
Commission. These weights are adjusted 
every Þ ve years and whenever new Member 
States join the EU. Based on Council Decision 
2003/517/EC of 15 July 2003 on the statistical 
data to be used for the adjustment of the key 
for subscription to the capital of the European 
Central Bank, 11 the NCBs™ capital key shares were adjusted on 1 January 2007, upon the 
accession of Bulgaria and Romania as new 
Member States, as follows:See also Chapter 2 of the ECB™s Annual Report.10 OJ L 181, 19.7.2003, p. 43.11 2007 •2006 •Change •Gold5,830,485,3884,861,575,989968,909,399

225ECB Annual Report2007(B) CAPITAL OF THE ECBIn accordance with Article 49.3 of the Statute 
of the ESCB, which was added to the Statute by 

the Treaty of Accession, the ECB™s subscribed 

capital is automatically increased when a new 

Member State joins the EU and its NCB joins the 

ESCB. The increase is determined by multiplying 

the prevailing amount of the subscribed capital 

(i.e. •5,565 million as at 31 December 2006) 

by the ratio, within the expanded capital key, 

between the weighting of the entering NCB(s) 

and the weighting of those NCBs that are 

already members of the ESCB. Therefore, on 

1 January 2007, the subscribed capital of the 

ECB was increased to •5,761 million. 
In accordance with Article 49.1 of the Statute of 
the ESCB and a legal act adopted by the 
Governing Council on 30 December 2006 12, Banka Slovenije paid up an amount of 
•17,096,556 as at 1 January 2007, which 
represented the remainder of its capital 
subscription to the ECB.The non-euro area NCBs are required to pay up 7% of their subscribed capital as a contribution 
to the operational costs of the ECB. Therefore, as 
at 1 January 2007, the Bulgarian National Bank 
and Banca Naional a României paid amounts of •3,561,869 and •10,156,952 respectively. 
Including these amounts, this contribution 
amounted to a total of •122,952,830 at 
end-2007. The non-euro area NCBs are not 
entitled to receive any share of the distributable 
proÞ ts of the ECB, including income arising 
from the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystem, nor are they liable to fund any loss 
of the ECB. The combined effect of the three developments described was that the ECB™s paid-up 
capital increased from •4,089,277,550 on 
31 December 2006 to •4,127,136,230 on 
1 January 2007, as shown in the table below: 13Decision ECB/2006/30 of 30 December 2006 on Banka 12 Slovenije™s paying-up of capital, transfer of foreign reserve assets and contribution to the European Central Bank™s reserves

reserve assets already transferred to the ECB by 
the ratio between the number of shares

number of shares already paid up by the other 
NCBs without a derogation. These foreign 
reserve assets comprised amounts of US dollars 
in the form of cash, and gold, in proportions of 
85 to 15 respectively. The Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta were credited with claims in respect of 
the paid-up capital and foreign reserve assets

As part of the management of the ECB™s own funds, the ECB has concluded an automatic 
security lending programme agreement, whereby 
an appointed agent enters into security lending 
transactions on behalf of the ECB with a number 
of counterparties, designated by the ECB as 
eligible counterparties. Under this agreement, 
reverse transactions with a value of •3.0 billion

An action for damages was brought against the ECB before the Court of First Instance of the 
European Communities (CFI) by Document 
Security Systems Inc. (DSSI), alleging that the 
ECB had infringed a DSSI patent 15 in the production of euro banknotes. The CFI has 
dismissed DSSI™s action for damages against 
the ECB. 16 The ECB is currently pursuing actions to revoke that patent in a number of 
national jurisdictions. Furthermore, the ECB has 
the Þ rm conviction that it has in no way infringed 
the patent, and will consequently also enter a 
defense against any infringement action that 
may be brought by DSSI before any competent 
national court. DSSI™s European Patent No 0455 750 B1.15 Order of the Court of First Instance of 5 September 2007, Case 16 T-295/05. Available at www.curia.eu.229ECB Annual Report200723 NET INTEREST INCOME
INTEREST INCOME ON FOREIGN RESERVE ASSETSThis item includes interest income, net of interest expense, in respect of the assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency, as 
follows: INTEREST INCOME ARISING FROM THE 

ALLOCATION OF EURO BANKNOTES WITHIN THE 

EUROSYSTEM 
This item consists of the interest income relating 
to the ECB™s share in the total euro banknote 
issue. Interest on the claims of the ECB in 
respect of its share of banknotes is earned 
at the latest available marginal rate for the 
Eurosystem™s main reÞ nancing operations. The 
increase in income in 2007 reß ected both the 
general increase in euro banknotes in circulation 
and the increases in the ECB™s main reÞ nancing rate. This income is distributed to the NCBs as 
described in ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the 
notes on accounting policies. Based on the ECB™s estimated Þ nancial result 
for 2007, the Governing Council decided to withhold distribution of the whole of this 
income. REMUNERATION OF NCBS’ CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF 

FOREIGN RESERVES TRANSFERRED 
Remuneration paid to euro area NCBs on their 
claims on the ECB in respect of the foreign 
reserve assets transferred under Article 30.1 of 
the Statute of the ESCB is disclosed under this 
item.OTHER INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER INTEREST 

EXPENSEThese items include interest income of 
•3.9 billion (2006: •2.5 billion) and expenses 
of •3.8 billion (2006: •2.4 billion) on balances 
arising from TARGET/TARGET2. Interest 
income and expenses in respect of other assets 
and liabilities denominated in euro are also 
shown here.24 REALISED GAINS/LOSSES ARISING FROM

230ECB Annual Report200725 WRITE-DOWNS ON FINANCIAL ASSETS AND 
POSITIONS 
The exchange rate losses are primarily due to the write-down of the average acquisition costs of 
the ECB™s US dollar and Japanese yen holdings 
to their end-of-year exchange rates, following 
the depreciation of these currencies against the 
euro over the year. 26 NET EXPENSE FROM FEES AND COMMISSIONS 
Income under this heading includes penalties 

imposed on credit institutions for non-compliance 

with the minimum reserve requirements. 

Expenses relate to fees payable on current 

accounts and in connection with the execution of 

foreign currency interest rate futures (see note 18, 

ﬁInterest rate futuresﬂ).27 INCOME FROM EQUITY SHARES AND 
PARTICIPATING INTERESTS 
Dividends received on shares in the BIS (see 
note 6, ﬁOther assetsﬂ) are shown under this 
heading. 28 OTHER INCOME 
Other miscellaneous income during the year 
arose principally from the contributions of other 
central banks to the cost of a service contract 
held centrally by the ECB with an external 
provider of an IT network. 29 STAFF COSTS 
Salaries, allowances, staff insurance and other 
miscellaneous costs of •141.7 million (2006: 
•133.4 million) are included under this heading. 
Staff costs of •1.1 million (2006: •1.0 million) 
incurred in connection with the construction of 
the new ECB premises have been capitalised 
and are excluded from this item. Salaries and 
allowances, including the emoluments of 
holders of senior management positions, are 
modelled in essence on, and are comparable 
with, the remuneration scheme of the European 
Communities.Members of the Executive Board receive a basic salary and additional allowances for residence 
and representation. In the case of the President, 
an ofÞ cial residence owned by the ECB is 
provided in lieu of a residence allowance. 
Subject to the Conditions of Employment for 
Staff of the European Central Bank, members of 
the Executive Board are entitled to household, 
child and education allowances, depending on 
their individual circumstances. Basic salaries are 
subject to a tax for the beneÞ t of the European 
Communities as well as to deductions in respect 
of contributions to the pension, medical and 
accident insurance schemes. Allowances are 
non-taxable and non-pensionable. The pension 
arrangements for the Executive Board are 
described in ﬁThe ECB™s retirement plan and 
other post-employment beneÞ tsﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies.Basic salaries paid to members of the Executive Board over the year were as follows:2007 •2006 •Change •Unrealised price losses

231ECB Annual Report2007The total allowances paid to the members of the Executive Board and their beneÞ ts from the 
ECB™s contributions to the medical and accident 
insurance schemes amounted to •579,842 
(2006: •557,421), resulting in total emoluments 
of •2,207,366 (2006: •2,153,013).Transitional payments are made to former 
members of the Executive Board for a period after 

the end of their terms of ofÞ ce. In 2007, these 
payments and the ECB™s contributions to the 

medical and accident insurance schemes of former 

members amounted to •52,020 (2006: •292,280). 

Pension payments, including related allowances, 

to former members of the Executive Board or their 

dependents and contributions to the medical and 

accident insurance schemes amounted to •249,902 

(2006: •121,953).Also included under this item is an amount of •27.2 million (2006: •27.4 million) recognised 
in connection with the ECB™s retirement plan 
and other post-employment beneÞ ts (see 
note 12, ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ). At the end of 2007 the actual full-time equivalent number of staff holding permanent or Þ xed-term contracts was 1,375 17, including 149 with managerial positions. The change in the number 
of staff during 2007 was as follows:The number of staff as at 31 December 2007 
includes the full-time equivalent of 79 staff 
(2006: 63) on unpaid/parental leave and 21 
on maternity leave (2006: 10). In addition, as 
at 31 December 2007, the ECB employed the 
full-time equivalent of 71 staff (2006: 70) on 
short-term contracts to replace staff on unpaid/
parental and maternity leave. The ECB also offers the possibility to staff from other central banks of the ESCB to undertake 
temporary assignments at the ECB, and the 
related costs are included under this heading.
76 ESCB staff were participating in this 
programme as at 31 December 2007 (2006: 61).30 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
These cover all other current expenses relating to 

the renting and maintenance of premises, goods 

and equipment of a non-capital nature, professional 

fees and other services and supplies, together 

with staff-related expenses including recruitment, 

relocation, installation, training and resettlement.31 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION SERVICES 
This expense relates to costs arising from 
cross-border transportation of euro banknotes 
between NCBs to meet unexpected ß uctuations in demand for banknotes. These costs are borne 
centrally by the ECB. Until 2006, the full-time equivalent of all permanent and Þ xed-17 term contractual commitments was provided in this note. From 2007, it has been decided to provide the actual full-time equivalent 
number of staff holding permanent or Þ xed-term contracts, as 
it is considered to be more relevant to the users of the Þ nancial statements. The 2006 Þ gures have been adjusted accordingly.

of the ECB for the year 2007.INCOME RELATED TO THE ECB’S SHARE OF TOTAL 
BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATIONIn 2006, following a decision by the Governing 
Council, income of •1,319 million earned on 
the ECB™s share of total banknotes in circulation 
was retained to ensure that the ECB™s total proÞ t distribution for the year did not exceed its net 
proÞ t for the year. Similarly, in 2007 an amount 
of •2,004 million was retained. Both amounts 
represented the full income earned on the ECB™s 
share of total euro banknotes in circulation in 
the years in question.PROFIT DISTRIBUTION/COVERAGE OF LOSSESPursuant to Article 33 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
the net proÞ t of the ECB shall be transferred in 
the following order:(a) an amount to be determined by the Governing 
Council, which may not exceed 20% of the net proÞ t, shall be transferred to the general 
reserve fund subject to a limit equal to 100% 
of the capital; and (b) the remaining net pro
Þ t shall be distributed 
to the shareholders of the ECB in proportion 
to their paid-up shares.In the event of a loss incurred by the ECB, the 
shortfall may be offset against the general 
reserve fund of the ECB and, if necessary, 
following a decision by the Governing Council, 
against the monetary income of the relevant 
Þ nancial year in proportion and up to the 
amounts allocated to the NCBs in accordance 
with Article 32.5 of the Statute. 18In 2007 the funding of the provision against 
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 
price risks for the amount of •286 million had 
the effect of reducing net proÞ t to exactly zero. 
Consequently, as in both 2005 and 2006, no transfers to the general reserve fund or proÞ t distribution to the shareholders of the ECB took 
place. There was also no requirement to offset 
a loss.Under Article 32.5 of the Statute of the ESCB, the sum of the 18 NCBs™ monetary income shall be allocated to the NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB.236ECBAnnual Report

2007This glossary contains selected terms that are used in the Annual Report. A more comprehensive and detailed glossary can be found on the ECB™s website.Balance of payments (b.o.p.): a statistical statement that summarises, for a speciÞ c period of time, the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The transactions considered are those involving goods, services and income; those involving Þ nancial claims on, and liabilities to, 
the rest of the world; and those (such as debt forgiveness) that are classiÞ ed as transfers.
Benchmark portfolio: in relation to investments, a reference portfolio or index constructed on the basis of the objectives for the liquidity and risk of, as well as the return on, the investments. The 
benchmark portfolio serves as a basis for comparison of the performance of the actual portfolio.Bond market: the market in which longer-term debt securities are issued and traded.Candidate countries: countries for which the EU has accepted an application for EU membership. Accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey began on 3 October 2005, while those with the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have not yet started.Central counterparty: an entity that interposes itself between the counterparties to the contracts traded in one or more Þ nancial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.Central government: the government as deÞ ned in the European System of Accounts 1995 but excluding regional and local governments (see also general government).Central securities depository (CSD): an entity that i) enables securities transactions to be processed and settled by book entry, and ii) plays an active role in ensuring the integrity of securities 
issues. Securities can be held in physical (but immobilised) or dematerialised form (i.e. so that they 
exist only as electronic records). Collateral: assets pledged or otherwise transferred (e.g. by credit institutions to central banks) as a guarantee for the repayment of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. by credit institutions to central 
banks) under repurchase agreements.Consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector: a balance sheet obtained by netting out inter-
MFI positions (e.g. inter-MFI loans and deposits) in the aggregated MFI balance sheet. It provides statistical information on the MFI sector™s assets and liabilities vis-à-vis residents of the euro area not belonging to this sector (i.e. general government and other euro area residents) and vis-à-vis non-euro area residents. It is the main statistical source for the calculation of monetary aggregates, 
and it provides the basis for the regular analysis of the counterparts of M3.Corporate governance: rules, procedures and processes according to which an organisation is directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure speciÞ es the distribution of rights and responsibilities among the different participants in the organisation Œ such as the board, managers, 
shareholders and other stakeholders Œ and lays down the rules and procedures for decision-making.Corporate profitability: a measure of the earnings performance of corporations, mainly in relation to their sales, assets or equity. There are a number of different corporate proÞ tability ratios based on company Þ nancial statements, such as the ratio of operating income (sales minus GLOSSARY258ECBAnnual Report
2007operating expenses) to sales, the ratio of net income (operating and non-operating income, after tax, depreciation and extraordinary items) to sales, the return on assets (relating net income to total 
assets) and the return on equity (relating net income to shareholders™ funds). At the macroeconomic 
level, the gross operating surplus, based on national accounts, for instance in relation to GDP or value added, is often used as a measure of proÞ tability. Correspondent central banking model (CCBM): a mechanism established by the Eurosystem with the aim of enabling counterparties to use eligible assets on a cross-border basis. In the CCBM, NCBs act as custodians for one another. Each NCB has a securities account in its securities 
administration for each of the other NCBs (and for the European Central Bank). Cost of the external financing of non-financial corporations (real): the cost incurred by non-
Þ nancial corporations when taking up new external funds. For euro area non-Þ nancial corporations, it is calculated as a weighted average of the cost of bank lending, the cost of debt securities and the cost of equity, based on the amounts outstanding (corrected for valuation effects) and deß ated by inß ation expectations.
Counterparty: the opposite party in a Þ nancial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with a central bank).Credit derivative: a Þ nancial instrument which separates the credit risk from an underlying 
Þ nancial transaction, enabling the credit risk to be priced and transferred separately.
Credit institution: i) an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credit for its own account; or ii) an undertaking or any other legal person, other than those under i), which issues means of payment in the form of electronic money.Credit risk: the risk that a counterparty will not settle an obligation for full value, either when due or at any time thereafter. Credit risk includes replacement cost risk and principal risk. It also includes the risk of the failure of the settlement bank.Debt security: a promise on the part of the issuer (i.e. the borrower) to make one or more payments to the holder (the lender) at a speciÞ ed future date or dates. Such securities usually carry a speciÞ c rate of interest (the coupon) and/or are sold at a discount to the amount that will be repaid at 
maturity. Debt securities issued with an original maturity of more than one year are classiÞ ed as 
long-term.Deposit facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use to make overnight deposits, remunerated at a pre-speciÞ ed interest rate, at an NCB (see also key ECB interest rates).Direct investment: cross-border investment for the purpose of obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy (assumed, in practice, for ownership of at least 10% of the 
ordinary shares or voting power).ECOFIN Council: the EU Council meeting in the composition of the ministers of economy and Þ nance.259ECBAnnual Report
2007Economic analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions. The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of current economic and Þ nancial developments and the implied short to medium-term risks to price stability from the perspective of the interplay between supply and demand in goods, services and factor markets at those horizons. Due attention is paid to the need to identify the nature of shocks 
affecting the economy, their effects on cost and pricing behaviour, and the short to medium-term 
prospects for their propagation in the economy (see also monetary analysis).Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a consultative Community body which contributes to the preparation of the work of the ECOFIN Council and the European Commission. Its tasks include reviewing the economic and Þ nancial situation of the Member States and of the Community, and budgetary surveillance.Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the process that led to the single currency, the euro, and the single monetary policy in the euro area, as well as to the coordination of the economic policies of the EU Member States. This process, as laid down in the Treaty, took place in three stages. Stage 
Three, the Þ nal stage, started on 1 January 1999 with the transfer of monetary competence to the European Central Bank and the introduction of the euro. The cash changeover on 1 January 2002 completed the process of setting up EMU.Effective exchange rate (EER) of the euro (nominal/real): weighted average of bilateral euro exchange rates against the currencies of the euro area™s important trading partners. The European Central Bank publishes nominal EER indices for the euro against two groups of trading partners: the EER-22 (comprising the 12 non-euro area EU Member States and 10 main trading partners 
outside the EU) and the EER-42 (composed of the EER-22 and 20 additional countries). The 
weights used reß ect the share of each partner country in euro area trade and account for competition in third markets. Real EERs are nominal EERs deß ated by a weighted average of foreign, relative 
to domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measures of price and cost competitiveness.EONIA (euro overnight index average): a measure of the effective interest rate prevailing in the euro interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest rates on 
unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by a panel of contributing 
banks.Equities: securities representing ownership of a stake in a corporation. They comprise shares traded on stock exchanges (quoted shares), unquoted shares and other forms of equity. Equities usually 
produce income in the form of dividends.Equity market: the market in which equities are issued and traded.ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II): the exchange rate mechanism which provides the framework for exchange rate policy cooperation between the euro area countries and the non-euro area EU Member States. ERM II is a multilateral arrangement with Þ xed, but adjustable, central rates and a standard ß uctuation band of ±15%. Decisions concerning central rates and, 
possibly, narrower ß uctuation bands are taken by mutual agreement between the EU Member State 
concerned, the euro area countries, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the other EU Member States participating in the mechanism. All participants in ERM II, including the ECB, have the right 
to initiate a conÞ dential procedure aimed at changing the central rates (realignment).260ECBAnnual Report
2007EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate): the rate at which a prime bank is willing to lend funds in euro to another prime bank, as reported by a panel of contributing banks, computed daily for 
interbank deposits with different maturities of up to 12 months.Euro area: the area encompassing those Member States which have adopted the euro as the single currency in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy is conducted under the responsibility of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. The euro area currently comprises Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, 
Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Finland.European Central Bank (ECB): the ECB lies at the centre of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and has its own legal personality in accordance with the Treaty (Article 107(2)). It ensures that the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem and the ESCB are implemented either through its own activities or through those of the NCBs, pursuant to the Statute 
of the ESCB. The ECB is governed by the Governing Council and the Executive Board, and, as a third decision-making body, by the General Council. European Monetary Institute (EMI): a temporary institution established at the start of Stage 
Two of Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1994. It went into liquidation following the establishment of the European Central Bank on 1 June 1998.European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95): a comprehensive and integrated system of macroeconomic accounts based on a set of internationally agreed statistical concepts, deÞ nitions, classiÞ cations and accounting rules aimed at achieving a harmonised quantitative description of the economies of the EU Member States. The ESA 95 is the Community™s version of the world System 
of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93).European System of Central Banks (ESCB): composed of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the NCBs of all 27 EU Member States, i.e. it includes, in addition to the members of the Eurosystem, the NCBs of those Member States that have not yet adopted the euro. The ESCB is governed by the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the ECB, and, as a third decision-making body of the ECB, by the General Council.Eurosystem: the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the European Central Bank and the NCBs of the Member States that have adopted the euro.Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF): the framework that deÞ nes the procedures, rules and techniques which ensure that all eligible assets meet the Eurosystem™s high credit standards.Excessive deficit procedure: the provision set out in Article 104 of the Treaty and speciÞ ed in Protocol No 20 on the excessive deÞ cit procedure requires EU Member States to maintain budgetary 
discipline, deÞ nes the criteria for a budgetary position to be considered an excessive de
Þ cit and 
regulates steps to be taken following the observation that the requirements for the budgetary balance or government debt have not been fulÞ lled. Article 104 is supplemented by Council Regulation 
(EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive 
deÞ cit procedure (as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1056/2005 of 27 June 2005), which 
is one element of the Stability and Growth Pact.261ECBAnnual Report
2007Executive Board: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and four other members appointed by common accord by the Heads of State or Government of the Member States that have adopted 
the euro.Financial stability: condition in which the Þ nancial system Œ comprising Þ nancial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures Œ is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of 
Þ nancial imbalances, thereby mitigating the likelihood of disruptions in the Þ nancial intermediation 
process which are severe enough to signiÞ cantly impair the allocation of savings to pro
Þ table investment opportunities.Financing gap of non-financial corporations: the Þ nancing gap can be de
Þ ned as the balance 
between the corporate savings (through retained earnings and depreciation allowances) and the 
non-Þ nancial investment of non-
Þ nancial corporations. The 
Þ nancing gap can also be de
Þ ned on 
the basis of the Þ nancial accounts, as the balance between the net acquisition of 
Þ nancial assets and 
the net incurrence of liabilities by non-Þ nancial corporations. There are statistical discrepancies 
between the two measures owing to differences in source statistics.Fine-tuning operation: an open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in order to deal with unexpected liquidity ß uctuations in the market. The frequency and maturity of Þ ne-tuning operations are not standardised.Foreign exchange swap: simultaneous spot and forward transactions exchanging one currency against another.General Council: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and the governors of all the NCBs of the European System of Central Banks.General government: a sector deÞ ned in the European System of Accounts 1995 as comprising resident entities that are engaged primarily in the production of non-market goods and services intended for individual and collective consumption and/or in the redistribution of national income 
and wealth. Included are central, regional and local government authorities, as well as social 
security funds. Excluded are government-owned entities that conduct commercial operations, such 
as public enterprises.Governing Council: the supreme decision-making body of the European Central Bank (ECB). It comprises all the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the NCBs of the Member States that have adopted the euro.Gross operating surplus: the surplus (or deÞ cit) on the value of output of production activities after the costs of intermediate consumption, compensation of employees and taxes less subsidies 
on production have been deducted, but before payments and receipts of income related to the 
borrowing/renting or owning of Þ nancial and non-produced assets have been taken into account.
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP): a measure of consumer prices that is compiled by Eurostat and harmonised for all EU Member States.262ECBAnnual Report
2007Implied volatility: the expected volatility (i.e. standard deviation) in the rates of change of the price of an asset (e.g. a share or a bond). It can be derived from the asset™s price, maturity date and 
exercise price of its options, as well as from a riskless rate of return, using an option pricing model 
such as the Black-Scholes model.International investment position (i.i.p.): the value and composition of an economy™s outstanding net Þ nancial claims on (or Þ nancial liabilities to) the rest of the world.
Key ECB interest rates: the interest rates, set by the Governing Council, which reß ect the monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank. They are the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility and the interest rate on the deposit facility.Liquidity risk: the risk that a counterparty will not settle an obligation in full when due. Liquidity risk does not imply that a counterparty or participant is insolvent, since it may be able to effect the required settlement at some unspeciÞ ed time thereafter.Lisbon strategy: a comprehensive agenda of structural reforms aimed at transforming the EU into ﬁthe most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the worldﬂ, launched in 2000 by 
the Lisbon European Council.Longer-term refinancing operation: a regular open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in the form of reverse transactions. Such operations are carried out through a monthly standard tender and normally have a maturity of three months.
M1: a narrow monetary aggregate that comprises currency in circulation plus overnight deposits held with MFIs and central government (e.g. at the post ofÞ ce or treasury).M2: an intermediate monetary aggregate that comprises M1 plus deposits redeemable at a period of notice of up to and including three months (i.e. short-term savings deposits) and deposits with an 
agreed maturity of up to and including two years (i.e. short-term time deposits) held with MFIs and central government.M3: a broad monetary aggregate that comprises M2 plus marketable instruments, in particular repurchase agreements, money market fund shares/units, and debt securities with a maturity of up to and including two years issued by MFIs.Main refinancing operation: a regular open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in the form of reverse transactions. Such operations are carried out through a weekly standard tender and normally have a maturity of one week.
Maintenance period: the period over which credit institutions™ compliance with reserve requirements is calculated. The maintenance period begins on the settlement day of the Þ rst main refinancing operation following the meeting of the Governing Council at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled. The European Central Bank publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of the year.263ECBAnnual Report
2007Marginal lending facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use to receive overnight credit from an NCB at a pre-speciÞ ed interest rate against eligible assets (see also key ECB interest rates).Market risk: the risk of losses (in both on and off-balance-sheet positions) arising from movements in market prices. MFIs (monetary financial institutions): Þ nancial institutions which together form the money-
issuing sector of the euro area. These include the Eurosystem, resident credit institutions (as deÞ ned in Community law) and all other resident Þ nancial institutions whose business is to receive 
deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for their own account (at least in economic terms), to grant credit and/or invest in securities. The latter group 
consists predominantly of money market funds.MFI credit to euro area residents: MFI loans granted to non-MFI euro area residents (including general government and the private sector) and MFI holdings of securities (shares, other equity and debt securities) issued by non-MFI euro area residents.MFI interest rates: the interest rates that are applied by resident credit institutions and other MFIs, excluding central banks and money market funds, to euro-denominated deposits and loans vis-à-vis households and non-Þ nancial corporations resident in the euro area.MFI longer-term financial liabilities: deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years, deposits redeemable at a period of notice of over three months, debt securities issued by euro area MFIs with an original maturity of more than two years, and the capital and reserves of the euro area MFI sector.MFI net external assets: the external assets of the euro area MFI sector (such as gold, foreign 
currency banknotes and coins, securities issued by non-euro area residents and loans granted to non-
euro area residents) minus the external liabilities of the euro area MFI sector (such as non-euro area residents™ deposits and repurchase agreements, as well as their holdings of money market fund 
shares/units and debt securities issued by MFIs with a maturity of up to and including two years).Minimum bid rate: lower limit to the interest rates at which counterparties may submit bids in the variable rate tenders of the main refinancing operations. This is one of the key ECB interest rates reß ecting the stance of monetary policy.
Monetary analysis: one pillar of the European Central Bank™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions. The monetary analysis helps to assess medium to long-term trends in inß ation, in view of the close relationship between money and prices over extended horizons. The monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of monetary 
indicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures of excess liquidity (see also economic analysis).Monetary income: income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the Eurosystem™s monetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with guidelines established 
by the Governing Council and held against banknotes in circulation and deposit liabilities to credit institutions.264ECBAnnual Report
2007Money market: the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded using instruments which generally have an original maturity of up to and including one year.Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in the Þ nancial market. With regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, Eurosystem open market operations can be divided into four categories: main refinancing operations; longer-term refinancing operations; fine-tuning operations; and structural operations. As for the instruments used, reverse transactions are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed in all four categories of operations. In addition, the issuance of debt certiÞ cates and outright transactions are available for structural operations, while outright transactions, foreign exchange swaps and the collection of Þ xed-term deposits are available for the conduct of Þ ne-tuning operations.
Option: a Þ nancial instrument that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
speciÞ c assets (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predetermined price (the strike or exercise price) at or up 
to a certain future date (the exercise or maturity date).Other financial intermediary (OFI): a corporation or quasi-corporation (other than an insurance corporation or pension fund) that is engaged mainly in Þ nancial intermediation by incurring liabilities in forms other than currency, deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from 
institutional entities other than MFIs. OFIs include in particular corporations engaged primarily in 
long-term Þ nancing, such as 
Þ nancial leasing, securitised asset holdings, other 
Þ nancial holdings, 
securities and derivatives dealing (on their own account), venture capital and development capital.Portfolio investment: euro area residents™ net transactions and/or positions in securities issued by non-residents of the euro area (ﬁassetsﬂ) and non-residents™ net transactions and/or positions 
in securities issued by euro area residents (ﬁliabilitiesﬂ). Included are equity securities and debt securities (bonds and notes, and money market instruments), excluding amounts recorded in direct investment or reserve assets.Price stability: the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem. The Governing Council deÞ nes price stability as a year-on-year increase in the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. The Governing Council has also made it clear that, in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inß ation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
Primary balance: government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments on consolidated government liabilities. 
Projections: the results of exercises conducted four times a year to project possible future macroeconomic developments in the euro area. Eurosystem staff projections are published in June and December, whereas European Central Bank (ECB) staff projections are published in March and September. They form part of the economic analysis pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB and are thus one of several inputs into the Governing Council™s assessment of the risks to price stability.
Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system: a settlement system in which processing and settlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time (continuously) (see 
also TARGET).265ECBAnnual Report
2007Reference value for M3 growth: the annual growth rate of M3 over the medium term that is consistent with the maintenance of price stability. At present, the reference value for annual M3 growth is 4½%.Repurchase agreement: a contract to sell and subsequently repurchase securities on a speciÞ ed date and at a speciÞ ed price. Also called a ﬁrepoﬂ.Reserve base: the sum of the eligible balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) that constitute the basis for calculating the reserve requirement of a credit institution.Reserve ratio: the ratio deÞ ned by the central bank for each category of eligible balance sheet items included in the reserve base. The ratio is used to calculate reserve requirements.Reserve requirement: the minimum amount of reserves a credit institution is required to hold with the Eurosystem. Compliance is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balances over a maintenance period.Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.Securities settlement system (SSS): a transfer system for settling securities transactions. It comprises all of the institutional arrangements required for the clearing and settlement of securities trades and the provision of custody services for securities. Settlement risk: the risk that settlement in a transfer system will not take place as expected, usually owing to a party defaulting on one or more settlement obligations. This risk comprises, in particular, 
operational risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.Stability and Growth Pact: the Stability and Growth Pact is intended to serve as a means of safeguarding sound government Þ nances in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union in order to strengthen the conditions for price stability and for strong, sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. To this end, the Pact prescribes that Member States specify medium-term 
budgetary objectives. It also contains concrete speciÞ cations on the excessive deficit procedure. The Pact consists of the Resolution of the Amsterdam European Council of 17 June 1997 on the 
Stability and Growth Pact and two Council Regulations, namely i) Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 
7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and 
coordination of economic policies as amended by Regulation (EC) 1055/2005 of 27 June 2005, and 
ii) Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation 
of the excessive deÞ cit procedure as amended by Regulation (EC) 1056/2005 of 27 June 2005. The Stability and Growth Pact is complemented by the ECOFIN Council™s report entitled ﬁImproving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, which was endorsed by the Brussels 
European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005. It is also complemented by the new Code of Conduct 
entitled ﬁSpeciÞ cations on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and Guidelines on the format and content of stability and convergence programmesﬂ, which was endorsed by the 
ECOFIN Council on 11 October 2005.Standing facility: a central bank facility available to counterparties on their own initiative. The Eurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility.266ECBAnnual Report
2007Straight-through processing (STP): the automated end-to-end processing of trades/payment transfers, including, where relevant, the automated completion of conÞ rmation, matching, generation, clearing and settlement of orders.Systemic risk: the risk that the inability of one participant to meet its obligations in a system will cause other participants to be unable to meet their obligations when due, with possible spillover 
effects such as signiÞ cant liquidity or credit problems that may threaten the stability of the Þ nancial system. Such inability may be caused by operational or Þ nancial problems.
TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer 
system): the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system for the euro. It is a decentralised system consisting of national RTGS systems, the ECB payment mechanism (EPM) and the interlinking 
mechanism.TARGET2: a new generation of the TARGET system which replaces the former decentralised technical structure with a single shared platform offering a harmonised service with a uniform pricing scheme.Treaty: refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community (ﬁTreaty of Romeﬂ). The Treaty has been amended on several occasions, in particular by the Treaty on European Union (ﬁMaastricht 
Treatyﬂ) which laid the foundations for Economic and Monetary Union and contained the Statute of the ESCB.6GG*6GG*
