  PH_711807_CEEOverview  The EU and euro-area 
economies entered 2007
 on a strong note thanks to 
sound domestic fundamen
tals and favourable global growth. In both areas, 
real GDP growth remained unchanged
 in the first quarter of 2007 
compared to the previous quarter, at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), well 
above estimates of po
tential growth. Economic activity 
started to ease in 
the second quarter, to 0.5% QoQ in the EU and 0.3% in the euro area, 

already before the turbulence broke 
out in the financial markets. The 
moderation could, at least partly, be 
explained by temporary factors such 
as the return to normal levels of
 construction investment, which were 
boosted by the unusually mild wint
er weather at the start of the year. 
Looking at the first two quarters to
gether gives a more 
accurate picture of 
the cyclical strength at the start of this year.  
The EU economy was thus in a relatively 
good position to
 weather the 
turmoil in the 
financial markets that bega
n during the summer. This re-
pricing of risk in global ass
et markets has not come as a surprise: risk 
premia had been unusually compressed in recent years, causing excessive 
risk taking in the search for yield.  
The current distress was triggered by a rap
id increase in defaults in the US 
sub-prime mortgage market, which
 is a small segment of the overall US 
mortgage market. However, as these sub-prime loans have been passed on 
to other banks / institutions, which
 subsequently mixed them with different 
loans or receivables into complex and quite opaque financial products such 
as collateralised debt obligations 
(CDOs), these risks have been distributed 
around the global financial system. 
For instance, some European 
institutions without any a
pparent connection to th
e US mortgage market 
were severely hit in recent months. Market participants became reluctant to 
engage with counterparties until the location of these losses became clearer 

and their own liquidity needs were 
fully assessed. While some markets 
have recovered (at least to a degree), crucial segments of the credit market, 
such as inter-bank lending, remain seriously disrupted. Even though major 

intervention by Central Bank
s to inject liquidity has 
helped to stabilise the 
markets, the turmoil has clearly 
tilted the balance of risk
s to the downside, 
in particular as regards the outlook for the US.  
The Commission's baseline forecast assumes that the turbulence will peter 
out gradually, although with a reduction 
in investors' appetite for risk and 
tighter financing conditions as a result.
 This would have a certain adverse 
effect on investment and consumption 
growth, which could be reinforced 
by wealth and confidence effects. However, a still benign global 

environment, high profit margins, confi
dence indicators remaining above 
their long-term averages, continued empl
oyment growth in the EU and, in 
some cases, expansionary fiscal policies sug
gest that growth should hold 
up reasonably well. Real GDP growth is therefore expected to decelerate 
from 2.9% this year to 2.4% in both 2008 and 2009 in the EU (and in the 

euro area from 2.6% in 20
07 to 2.2% in 2008 and 
2.1% in 2009), close to 
potential growth. This constitutes a downward revision of 0.3 of a 
percentage point (pp.) in 2008 for
 both areas compared to the spring 
forecast.  The EU economy was sound before the 
turbulence...  
...that tightened 
financing conditions, increased uncertainty 
and tilted the risks to 
the downside... 
...although solid 
fundamentals limit the 
downward revision  
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  Economic growth is being driven 
by domestic demand, with private 
consumption taking over as the ma
in engine of growth. Equipment 
investment is supported by sturd
y profits and still favourable demand 
expectations, while tighter financing condi
tions are likely to mainly affect 
construction investment. This would thereby accelerate the ongoing 
correction of the housing market in 
some countries like Spain and Ireland.  
Economic activity is also supported by
 a positive, albeit small, net 
contribution from the external sector this year in the euro area. The 

international environment is exp
ected to remain supportive, as a more 
marked slowdown in 
the US is largely offset by bu
oyant growth in the 
emerging markets. World GDP grow
th (excluding th
e EU) should ease 
slightly from 5.6% this year to 5.3% in 2008 before accelerating again to 
5.4% in 2009.  
World trade growth (excluding the EU) 
is set to decline 
somewhat from 
around 8% in 2006 to 7¾% 
this year, reflecting the glob
al slowdown in the 
manufacturing sector. With world GDP 
growth sustained above 5% per 
annum, world trade is expected to remain robust at 7-7½% in 2008-2009.  
The slowdown in the US economy appears sharper than expected this 
spring, with the downturn in the ho
using market curbing GDP growth to 
around 2% at present, well below trend. A 
further decline in residential 
construction investment is forecast, which would bring the share of 
residential construction down from a peak
 of 5.5% of GDP in 2005 to 
3.5% by the end of 2008. Although 
different indicators have sent mixed 
signals recently, the downturn in the 
housing sector has affected other parts 
of the economy to a degree. However, the overall outlook remains for a 
mid-cycle slowdown in the US, not a recession. Once the housing cycle 

turns, economic activity could rebou
nd to its potential growth rate.  
In Japan, following 
strong growth at the start 
of this year activity declined 
in the second quarter (-1.2% QoQ annualised) due to a slump in business 
investment. Indeed, capital spending has 
stalled during the first two 
quarters, following four years of ve
ry strong expansi
on. Looking ahead, 
indicators point to real GDP growth at
 around 2% this year and next, i.e. 
still slightly above potential, 
before picking up some
what in 2009. With 
nominal wages continuing 
to decline in 2007 an
d core inflation declining 
further to -0.3% YoY in September, the economy remains in mild 
deflation. Inflation is expected to only turn 
positive at the start of 2008.  
The emerging Asian economies continue
 to post buoyant growth, with 
China and India exceeding expectations. For the region as a whole (i.e. 
Asia excluding Japan), real GDP growth is expected to ease marginally to 

just below 9% this year (an upward re
vision of 0.5 pp. compared to the 
spring forecast). Somewhat weaker export growth and the dampening 
impact of monetary and administrative measures should lead to a mild 
deceleration of growth in China over the forecast years, contributing to 
further growth 
moderation to 8½% in 2008 
and 8¼% in 2009 in the region. 
External sector remains 
supportive... ...in spite of the 
slowdown in the US... ...as it is compensated by buoyant growth in 

emerging economies  
PH_711807_CEEOverview  Among the other emerging economies, 
economic growth remains largely 
unchanged in the Middle East and North Africa at around 5¼% per year, 
while some deceleration is foreseen for the other regions. Following better-

than-expected growth in Russia this year, 
where the boost to investment 
from the liberalisation of the financial account in 2006 was 
underestimated, econom
ic activity in CIS is set to moderate as this 
temporary effect fades away, remaining however the second fastest 
growing region in the world. Real GDP growth is gaining momentum in 
Sub-Saharan Africa this year, not least because of higher oil production 

and high oil prices in several coun
tries, which is increasi
ngly supporting a 
pick-up in domestic demand. Growth is expected to moderate somewhat 
going forward, from around 7% in 2007 
to 6½% in 2008 and 2009. Lastly, 
the outlook for Latin Americ
a also remains favourable
 following stronger-
than-expected GDP growth in the first half 
of 2007. However, due to the 
expected moderation in global growt
h and emerging capacity constraints, 
GDP growth is projected to ease gr
adually from 5% in 
2007 to around 
4¼% in 2009.  
Owing to an expected rebound of growth in Turkey, real GDP growth in 
the candidate countries is forecast to accelerate from 5¼% this year to 
around 6½% in 2009. The disinflation pr
ocess is set to continue in Turkey, 
supported by monetary and fiscal polic
y, contributing to a more balanced 
growth ahead.  
Although commodity prices have more 
than doubled si
nce 2003, world 
GDP growth has remained solid. A certain impact on consumer price 

inflation has been noted, but, due to e.g. moderate wage behaviour overall, 
has so far not caused any sizeable second-round effects.  
Oil prices have reached new record highs during this autumn, with the cost 
of a barrel of Brent crude oil exceeding 84 US-dollar at the time of the cut-
off date (i.e. 24 October). Compared to 
mid-January, oil prices have risen 
by 65% (or by 49% expr
essed in euro), notwithstanding the fact that oil 
prices had already more than doubled in the preceding three years. A 
continued tight oil market, with sustai
ned strong demand and a sluggish 
expansion of supply, suggest that 
spare capacity and stock levels could 
remain under pressure. Consequently, oil prices are assumed to stay high in 
the near future and range, based on futures prices, between 75 and 81 US-

dollar per barrel, corresponding to an annual average increase of 6.6% this 
year and 11.7% in 2008 before eas
ing somewhat in 2009. Since the cut-off 
date for the autumn forecast, oil prices have continued to rise and reached 

90 US-dollar on 2 November; recent developments in the markets would 
imply that the oil price assumptions 
would have been around 6 US-dollar 
higher per barrel next year (or alm
ost 4 additional euros per barrel also 
taking into account the furthe
r strengthening of the euro). Using the 
multipliers from the Commission's global macroeconomic model QUEST 

as a rule of thumb, this would have lowered GDP growth by almost 0.2 pp. 
next year and increased consumer price inflation by 0.1 pp. 
Most non-fuel commodity prices also continued to rise this year, especially 
food commodities and metals. For ex
ample, wheat prices have doubled 
...and despite continued 
high oil prices

  over the last year as a result of adverse 
weather conditions 
in e.g. Europe, 
Africa and Australia. Under the 
assumption that weather conditions 
normalise and conditions in metal 
markets eases somewhat, non-fuel 
commodity price inflation cou
ld start to recede in th
e course of 2008.  
Looking ahead, survey data for the EU have started to decline in recent 
months. According to the Commission's most recent business and 
consumer surveys, economic sentiment has weakened in all sectors besides 
the construction sector. However, the economic sentiment indicators 
remain well above their long-term averages. 
National business surveys also 
have declined in recent months, though almost all remain at elevated 
levels. This would suggest relatively 
firm real GDP growth in the coming 
quarters, broadly in line with potential.  
Against this background, both hard 
and soft data suggest that the peak of 
the current business cycle is behind us, although data may partly be 
distorted by special factor
s (e.g. the impact of the VAT increase in 
Germany on the quarterly profiles at the turn of this year). For the year as a 

whole, real GDP growth is expected to
 ease only marginally to 2.9% in the 
EU and 2.6% in the euro-area economies (thus unchanged from the spring 
forecast).  Growth rates continue to vary across 
EU Member States. This can be 
partly explained by the ongoing ca
tching-up process in the recently-
acceded Member States, but there are also sizeable differences among the 
euro-area countries. Measured by an u
nweighted standard 
deviation, the 
growth dispersion in per capita terms 
is expected to de
cline slightly in 2007. However, this 
follows exclusively from the impact of the smaller 
Member States as the dispersion among 
the five largest countries remains 
unchanged. 
Although softening, survey data are still at 
high levels... PH_711807_CEEOverview  Going forward, output is set to decelerate to 2.4% in both 2008 and 2009 
in the EU (2.2% in 2008
 and 2.1% in 2009 in
 the euro area). This follows, 
in particular, from the impact of tight
er financing conditions and reduced 
confidence on domestic demand.  
Gross fixed capital formation, which has 
given a significant stimulus to 
growth since early 2006, is expected to moderate in the coming two years, 
with a more marked slowdown forecast for construction investment. The 
recent financial turbulence has caused tighter financing conditions and 
affected investor confidence negativ
ely. On the other hand, still elevated 
confidence levels in in
dustry and services, hi
gh capacity utilisation rates, 
sizeable profits and sound balance sheets suggest that the near-term 

outlook for equipment invest
ment remains relatively favourable.  
Private consumption picked up again in
 the second quar
ter of this year, 
thereby becoming the main engine of grow
th Œ as is to be expected in a 
maturing business cycle. The initially weaker development of private 
consumption compared to previous recoveries mainly reflected sluggish 
employment growth at the 
start of this upturn on top of rather subdued 
wage growth. On the back of the 
turnaround in the 
labour market situation 
since early 2006, consum
er confidence firmed and consumption growth 
gradually strengthened (although th
is trend may have been partly 
overshadowed in 2006-2007 by th
e temporary impact of the budgetary 
measures in Germany). With a still favo
urable employment outlook, a key 
question is to what degree consumer confidence will be affected by the 
distress in the financial markets. So 
far, confidence remains rather strong, 
although it should be noted that 
confidence in the 
retail sector declined 
sharply in September 2007 (as regards 
both the present and the expected 
business situation). The savings rate is 
expected to broadl
y stabilise in the 
EU, suggesting that private consumption 
would grow at around 2¼% in the 
coming two years in line with disposable income. 
Although the slowdown of growth in
 the US economy affects exports in 
the EU, especially in countries such as Ireland and the United Kingdom, 
the external sector remains
 supportive to growth th
is year. The impact of 
the appreciation of the euro on euro-area exports should be offset by a 
broadening of world growth and its 
ongoing shift in the geographical 
composition in favour of Asian and 
oil-exporting economies. Moreover, 
taking into account the developments in
 other key currencies, the gains in 
nominal effective terms have been 
markedly more moderate (about +3% 
vis-à-vis +8.5% in the bilateral US-do
llar/euro rate until end-October). 
Following a slight deterioration next year, European exports are forecast to 
benefit from the acceleration of world growth and world trade growth in 
2009.  ...suggesting more

  Turning to the labour market, employment growth accelerated to 1.5% in 
the euro area in 2007
 (whilst remaining unchanged at 1.5% in the EU), 
reflecting the lagged response of employ
ment to GDP. This corresponds to 
3.6 million new jobs in the EU this year (of which 2.3 million in the euro 
area). The improvement appears broad-based across all sectors as well as 
various types of work arrangements (e.g
. part-time, full-time, permanent 
and fixed-term contracts)
. Employment growth also
 seems to be largely 
balanced across Member States this year, although not always accelerating 
and with Hungary being an exception with declining employment.  
Going forward, a deceleration in employment growth to around 1% per 
year is expected in both the EU and the euro area as the business cycle 

matures. It follows, in particular, from
 a marked slowdown of job creation 
expected in Germany, Spain, and Poland among the larger Member States. 
However, this is still equivalent to 4.5 
million new jobs being created in 
the EU in 2008-2009 (3.2 million 
in the euro area) and is expected to bring 
the employment rate to above 66% of 
the working-age 
population in the 
EU by 2009. 
The unemployment rate fell to its lo
west level in more than fifteen years at 
7% of the labour force in the EU 
in the early autumn of 2007. The 
unemployment rate is expected to continu
e to decline gradually, albeit at a 
clearly slower pace, to reach 6.6% in the EU in 2009 (7.1% in the euro 
area). Although the cyclical upswing is the main factor behind the 
improved labour market situation in recent years, a decline in the estimated 
structural unemployment rat
e has also contributed 
to lower unemployment. 
With unemployment declining, labour shortages are becoming more 
common in both the manufacturing and services sectors, especially in 

Bulgaria, Denmark, the Netherlands and 
Poland. This tigh
tening of the 
labour market situ
ation is expected to pu
t some upward pressure on 
Strong job creation this 
year... ...brings unemployment

PH_711807_CEEOverview  nominal wage growth. Compensati
on of employees per head is therefore 
forecast to accelerate from 3% this year to 3.6% in 2008 in the EU, before 
easing somewhat in 2009. Similarly, euro-area wage growth is set to pick 

up from 2.6% in 2007 to 3.1% in 2008 before moderating to 2.8% in 2009. 
An easing in 2009 may appear some
what counterintuitive, but is above all 
explained by the impact of contract re
newals, one-offs and catching-up 
measures in 2008, particularly in Germ
any, Italy and Finland, which, at 
least in the German case, followed several years of wage restraint.  
Sustained labour productivity growth is expected over the forecast horizon 
that, at 1.3% in 2009 in
 the euro area and 1.6%
 in the EU, hovers around 
their long-term averages. This limits the rise in un
it labour cost over the 
forecast period across most Member States. After several years of low 
actual productivity growth in the 19
90s, the decline 
in trend labour 
productivity growth seems to have 
come to a halt, although at this stage 
there is no robust evid
ence of a pick-up in 
the underlying trend. 
Inflation has remained relatively containe
d during the first three quarters of 
this year. Headline HICP inflation decelerated to 2.1% on average in the 
EU and 1.8% in the euro area. Indeed, euro-area consumer prices remained 
below the 2% threshold for twelve mont
h in a row until September this 
year, when energy prices pushed the inflation rate above 2% again. The 
main reason behind this development 
is the strong increase in oil prices 
during 2006, which caused fav
ourable base effects in energy price inflation 
(YoY) during the first three quarters 
of this year. Core inflation (which 
excludes energy and unprocessed
 food), on the othe
r hand, continued to 
drift up. The gap between headlin
e and core inflation that has been 
observed over the last two years has therefore been closed. Indirect and 
second-round effects of high oil prices 
still appear to be relatively limited, 
as the pick-up in core inflation reflects, 
in particular, the impact of the 
German VAT hike by 3 pps. at th
e start of this year as well as strong 
increases in primary commodity prices. 
Going forward, euro-area inflation is expected to rise to 2.4% in the fourth 
quarter of this year reflecting base 
effects turning unfavourable and 
commodity prices on the rise, 
while unit labour costs remain relatively 
moderate. Consumer price inflation is expected to come back to around 2% 
in the second half of 2008 for the rem
ainder of the forecast horizon on the 
back of an assumed easing of oil pr
ices. A similar pattern is expected in the 
EU as a whole, albeit at a slightly higher level. This corresponds to a 
certain upward revision of annual co
nsumer price inflation: to 2.3% this 
year and 2.4% in 2008 in the EU, befo
re easing slightly to 2.2%, while 
accelerating from 2% this year to 2.1% in 2008 in the euro area, before 
decelerating somewhat to 2% in 2009. 
The current account is broadly in ba
lance for the EU and the euro area, but 
varies across Member States. In some of the recently-acceded Member 
States, a sizeable deficit may be linked to a catching-up process where 
external savings, especially in the form of foreign direct investment, could 

play an important role 
supporting income conv
ergence. Indeed, most of 
these countries also display buoyant investment 
growth and an annual 
Contained inflation so 
far this year... ...but higher commodity 
prices cause inflation to 
accelerate  Large current-account deficits may support 
income convergence, 
but entail risks 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  labour productivity growth of 5% or
 more. However, persistently large 
(and in some cases growing) deficits and external debts could raise some 
concerns about sustainability and vulnerab
ility. This may reflect, for 
example, difficulties in fin
ancing large external deficits in an environment 
of shifting risk preferences in the glob
al markets; or problems in adjusting 
the external position once the upswing 
of a strong credit boom has run its 
course.  Public finances are set to improve 
further this year. The general 
government deficit is expected to dec
line from 1.6% of GDP in 2006 to 
1.1% in 2007 in the EU (and from 1.5% to 0.8% in the euro area). This 
follows, in particular, from stronger-t
han-expected revenue growth in the 
euro area, which has been revised up to
 4.9% from 4.2% in the spring 
forecast. However, parts of these windfall gains have been used for 
additional expenditure this year and next in some of the Member States. 

Expenditure growth in the euro area is now forecast at 3.1% in 2007 (up 
from 2.8% in the spring forecast). For 
2008, a slight deterioration in the 
deficit is expected: to 1.2% of GDP in 
the EU and 0.9% in the euro area, 
also taking into account the mode
ration in economic activity. Based on the 
usual no-policy-change assumptions, the deficits are forecast to broadly 
stabilise in 2009
 in both areas. At the Member State level, the budgetary developments are more diverse 
than forecast this spring. While the outlook is for an improved budgetary 
position in most euro-area econom
ies, a worsening is now expected for 
Ireland throughout the forecast period
 as well as, although to a lesser 
extent, for Belgium and Greece this year. 
The deterioration 
anticipated for 
the Netherlands this year is e
xpected to be largely made up for over the 
coming two years. Conversely, th
e outlook for 2007 has improved 
particularly for Germany and Italy, ev
en though the 
fiscal consolidation projected in the spring for the 
latter country was slightly higher. A 
significant improvement is also foreseen for Portugal with the deficit 

falling below the 3% of GDP threshold in 2008. As regards the four 
Member States outside the euro area that are currently subject to the 
excessive deficit procedure (EDP), th
e budgetary positions improve 
significantly in Hungary, with the 
deficit falling from 6.4% this year to 
4.2% in 2008, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, while the deficit is set to 
rebound in Poland above the threshold in 2008 on account of an 

expansionary budget. Outside the 
countries currently in EDP, the deficit in 
Romania is expected to widen signific
antly and could reach 3.9% of GDP 
in 2009.  Unexpected revenue 
gains improve the 
budgetary outlook this 
year... ...but a worsening is 
expected for some 
countries PH_711807_CEEOverview  Taking into account temporary measures and cyclical factors, the estimated 
structural deficit is also declining this year (fro
m around 1½% to 1% in the 
EU and from about 1% to ¾% 
in the euro area). However the decline is 
less pronounced than for the nominal
 balance, reflecting a slowdown in 
fiscal consolidation. On th
e basis of the usual no-policy-change assumption 
and the information from the 2008 budgets 
available at the time of the 
forecast, no further improvement in the structural balance is expected for 
2008 and 2009. 
The general government gross debt 
ratio is maintaining its 
decline from the 
2005 peak. It is expected to decrease by more than 5 pps. between 2006 
and 2009 to 63.4% of euro-area GDP. As for the EU as a whole, the debt is 

forecast to gradually decline, falling below the 60%-of-GDP reference 
value already in 2007.  
Summing up, the economic outlook
 in the EU and the euro area is for a 
moderation of GDP growth to around potential during the forecast period. 
Consumer price inflation is expected to temporarily accelerate to 2.4% in 
the fourth quarter of 2007 in the euro area, before coming back to around 
2% in the third quarter of 2008 for the remainder of the forecast horizon. 
However, there are several risk factors to bo
th the growth and the inflation 
outlook. The balance of risk
s for economic growth is now clearly tilted to 
the downside and to the upside for consumer price inflation.  
The major downside risks relate to the recent turmoil in the financial 
markets and a sharper and/or more protracted slowdown in the US 

economy. While most financial markets 
have returned to a broadly normal 
functioning, significant disruptions 
persist in crucial market segments, 
signalling a continued lack of 
confidence affecting credit and liquidity 
provisions. The lack of transparency of market participants' exposure to the 
underlying risks could imply that 
the confidence effect may last for a 
protracted period of time. In that event, credit conditions and credit 

availability could be more seriously 
affected than assumed in the forecast. 
This could affect 
inter alia housing markets adversely, especially in the 
US, but also in the EU, thereby deepening and prolonging the ongoing 

corrections. The impact of a 
further tightening of 
lending cond
itions and 
reduced credit availability would 
affect Member States in different ways. 
Countries having had a housing boom in the recent past, with high external 

debt or a high share of debt at variable
 interest rates are likely to be more 
exposed than others.  
Further downside risks relate to a 
disorderly unwinding of global 
imbalances in general, even if the 
current outlook alread
y predicts a certain 
reduction of the US current-account deficit. Moreover, persistent large 

current-account imbalances 
could enhance the ri
sk of protectionist 
measures. Other downside risks relate 
to adverse developments in oil 
prices.  On the other hand, there are a number 
of upside risks. Commodity prices could well decrease over the forecasting period or the growth momentum 
in emerging markets could surprise on the upside. The dynamics in the 
Fiscal consolidation

Downside risks on

PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  labour market may also have been un
derestimated, giving
 an additional 
boost to labour income and consu
mer confidence. This could facilitate a 
return to a trend decline of the savin
gs rate following the temporary rise 
after the burst of the dot-com bubb
le at the start of this century Œ thereby 
yielding further support 
to private consumption. 
Risks appear to have increased 
also as regards the inflation outlook. This 
follows, in particular, fro
m the rise in commodity prices where the up-tick 
in food prices might have boosted in
flationary expectations and pressures 
recently. Indeed, the strong increase of consumer price inflation expected 
for October (up to 2.6% YoY) from 2.1% in September according to 
Eurostat's flash estimate, released after this forecast's cut-off date) seem to 

suggest a more pronoun
ced impact from food and energy prices. However, 
the marked increases in oil prices 
(in US-dollar) have had a relatively 
muted impact in recent years, owing to the competitive pressures of 

globalisation, a decline in 
the inflation of other 
goods and the appreciation 
of the euro, which partly offset the 
effect of higher oil prices on domestic 
inflation. Nevertheless, it cannot 
be excluded that there may be non-
linearities at play, possibly implying that oil prices above a certain 
threshold could influence domestic in
flationary pressures to a greater 
extent.  ...while there are upward risks on inflation 
 PH_711807_CEEOverview   Box 1: 
Some technicalities behind the forecast
The overall cut-off date to take new information into 
account when preparing this macroeconomic outlook 

was 24 October 2007. However, unemployment data 
have been revised thereafter following a major 
methodological change (see Eurostat's press release 
n°149/2007, 31 October 2007).  
External assumptions 
This forecast is based on a set of external assumptions. 
These assumptions reflect the market expectations at the 
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions from 
possible volatility during one specific trading day, 
averages from a 10-day reference period have been used 
for exchange and interest rates as well as for oil prices.  
Exchange and interest rates 
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates has 
been standardised using fixed nominal exchange rates 
for all currencies. They are kept constant based on the 

averages from 5 to 18 October. This technical 
assumption leads to implied average USD/EUR rates of 
1.36 in 2007, 1.42 in 2008 and 2009, and average 
JPY/EUR rates of 161.7 in 2007, 165.8 in 2008 and 
2009. 
Interest rate assumptions are now market-based instead 
of judgemental as was the case up until the autumn 2006 
forecast. Short-term interest rates for the euro area are 
derived from future contracts. Long-term interest rates 
for the euro area, as well as
 short- and lo
ng-term interest 
rates for other Member States, are calculated using 
implicit forward swap rates, corrected for the spread 
between the 3-month inter-bank interest rate and the 3-

month swap rate. In cases where no market instrument 
is available, a fixed spread vis-à-vis euro-area interest 
rates is taken for both short- and long-term rates. The 

reference period is from 5 to 18 October 2007. As a 
result, short- and long-term interest rates are expected at 
4.3% on average in 2007 and 4.4% in 2008 in the euro 
area. For 2009, short-term interest rates are assumed at 

4.3%, while long-term interest rates are at 4.5%. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity prices are also forecast taking into account 
market c
onditions. In the case of oil prices special 
attention is paid to futures' prices. Prices for Brent oil 
are, accordingly, projected to be 70.6 USD/bl in 2007, 

78.8 USD/bl in 2008 and 76.0 in 2009, c.f. table 62. 
This would correspond to an oil price of 51.8 EUR/bl. in 
2007, 55.6 EUR/bl. in 2008 and 53.6 EUR/bl. in 2009. 
Chain linking 
In order to improve the accuracy of GDP growth 
estimates, National Accounts have moved to ‚chain 
linking™ in most Member States to incorporate more up-
to-date price weights. Chain-linked series are based on 
previousyear™s prices (instead of prices from a given 
base year), which are then ‚chained™ together.  
Budgetary data 
Data up to 2006are based on government debt and 
deficit data transmitted by Member States to the 
European Commission in October 2007. In publishing 
these data, Eurostat has amended the deficit and debt 
data for Belgium for 2005 and 2006 and, more 
marginally, the deficit for the United Kingdom for the 
years 2003-2006. For Greece, the Commission hasused 
new GDP figures that,according to Eurostat, have been 
revised upwards by 9.6%.  
For 2008, budgets adopted or presented to parliaments 
and all other measures known in sufficient detail are 
taken into consideration. For 2009, the "no-
policy 
change" assumption used in the forecasts implies the 

extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends and the 
inclusion of measures that are known in sufficient 
detail. 
The general government balances reported by Member 
States to the European Commission may be slightly 
different from those published in the national accounts. 
The difference concerns settlements under swaps and 
forward rate agreements (FRA). According to ESA95 
(amended by regulation n°2558/2001), swaps and FRA-

related swaps are financial transactions and therefore 
excluded from the calculation of the government 
balance. However, for the purposes of the excessive 
deficit procedure, those flows are still booked as 

interest.  
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output gaps 
The number of working days may differ from one year 
to another. For 2005 and 2006, the effects were negative 
of around -0.1 pp. each year, while it is estimated to be 

close to neutral in 2007. 
Annual GDP figures are not adjusted for the number o
f working days, while quarterly figures mostly are. The 
calculation of potential growth and the output gap does 

not adjust for working days. Since it is considered 
temporary, it should not affect the cyclically-adjusted 
balances. 
  PH_711807_CEE   PH_711807_CEEChapter 1 The world economy   PH_711807_CEEPH_711807_CEE1. Global growth is withstanding the US 
slowdown  The outlook for the global economy remains largely 
positive, but the down
side risks have clearly 
increased. This is mainly due
 to a sharper housing 
downturn in the US, which has triggered distress in 
the credit markets. However, the slowdown of the US 
economy is anticipated to be largely offset by the 

strong expansion of other regions of the world, in 
particular Asia. All in all, world GDP growth is 
projected to ease gradually to 
5.1% this year and 4.7% 
next year, before picking up 
slightly to 4.8% in 2009. 
The main uncertainty of 
these projections lies in the 
magnitude of the US slowdown, which has proved to 
be sharper than expected in the spring forecast. The 

steep fall in residential in
vestment has depressed 
growth to below trend, 
with spillover effects on 
employment. It has also tr
iggered a re-assessment of 
risk on the financial 
markets, initiated by rising 
defaults in the sub-prime mo
rtgage market. While a 
certain decoupling between the US economy and the 

rest of the world has been observed so far, some 
economies are particularly de
pendent on US imports 
and would therefore be affected by a sharper and 
longer-lasting reduction of consumption growth in the 
US. In the same vein, a worsening of the situation in 

the credit markets would lead
 to a further tightening 
of financing conditions 
which could affect confidence 
and the global economy. 
GDP growth is supported by emerging 
economies–  As discussed, the recent developments in the global 
economy have shown a decoupling between the US 
and the rest of the world. While the underlying growth 

rate of the US economy is now clearly below 
potential, many emerging economies have accelerated 
more than expected in the spring forecast. They are 

likely to sustain high rates 
of growth next year, thus 
putting a floor under the moderation in global growth 
expected for 2008. In 2009, the rebound of US GDP 

growth should lead to a slight acceleration in global 
activity. Due to weaker US import growth, world 
trade growth has moderated in
 the first half of 2007. 
The global manufacturing PM
I indicator, which is 
normally a reliable indicator of world trade growth, 

suggests a further decline in the second half of the 
year. Therefore, growth in global imports of goods 
and services (excluding the EU) is projected to 

decrease to 7.8% in 2007 and 7.1% in 2008, before 
edging up to 7.7% in 2009.

robustness of the global 
economy, it is a noteworthy 
fact that several poles are taking over as drivers of 

world growth, with some 
of them particularly resilient 
to the US slowdown. Apart from Asia (especially 
China and India), the most outstanding cases are the

 PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  However, the resilience of these economies to a long-
lasting and sharper-than-expected downturn of the US 
may be questioned. First, a stagnation of US imports 

could entail an increase in the current-account deficit 
of emerging economies (especially in the non-oil-
producing CIS countries) and,
 therefore, lead to a 
marked depreciation of their currencies. Second, the

and could be affected by their exposure to the US 

situation, with possible repercussions on domestic 
consumption and investment.  
In terms of global current account imbalances, 
however, the slowdown of US imports, together with 

strongly rising exports, is 
having the positive 
consequence of reducing the deficit in US external 
accounts. The domestic counterpart is a rise in the 

household saving rate which should more than offset a 
projected increase in the fiscal deficit of general 
government. Nevertheless, the US current account 

deficit, even though decreasing, 
is projected to remain 
above 4% of GDP throughout the forecast period. 
– but is threatened by the turmoil in the credit 
markets 
A widespread re-pricing of 
risk started on the credit 
markets during the summer. It was triggered by a 
rapid increase in defau
lts in the US sub-prime 
mortgage markets. Due to 
the complexity of new 
financial instrument
s, such as securitisation 
derivatives, risk has become increasingly difficult to 

assess for investors, leading to a loss of confidence. 
As a result, financing conditions have begun to 
tighten globally. 
On inter-bank markets, th
e spreads between key 
interest rates and short-term rates have increased due 
to a rise in the perceived default risk. The spread 
between the euro-area key interest rate Œ the minimum 

rate of submission to the main refinancing operation Œ 
and the EURIBOR 3 months reached 75 basis points 
in October, reflecting heightened nervousness. The 

same phenomenon was observed on the US market. 
The repeated injections of 
liquidity by the ECB and 
the US Federal Reserve in order
 to abate tensions 
have not deterred banks from hoarding excess 
liquidity, therefore pushi
ng the short-term interest 
rates higher than usual. Despite the 50-bps-cut of the 
key policy rate in Septem
ber and expectations of 
further reduction, the US 
3-month rates are only 25 
basis points lower than six months ago, at about 
5.10% on 24 October. In the euro area, they are about 
75 basis points higher th
an their spring level, due to 
both the monetary tightening of the ECB and an 

increased spread stemming from the higher 
counterpart risk. On 24 October, they stood at about 
4.65%.  
On the bond markets, a general flight to quality 
caused US interest rates to
 decrease. This started in 
mid-July, in conjunction 
with the do
wnward revision 
of growth expectations and the monetary policy 

loosening. On 24 October, 
the 10-year benchmark rate 
had declined to about 4.35%. In the euro area, due to 
different growth scenarios, the developments were 

somewhat less pronounced. On
 24 October, the 10-
year rate stood at 4.15%, close
 to its spring levels.

 At the same time, the yield spreads between corporate 
and government bonds have increased on all the 
ratings, due to a sudden reassessment of counterparty 

risk. In an historical perspective, these yield spreads 
remain at low levels. Howev
er, a further tightening 
cannot be ruled out. In parallel, banks could also 

respond to the financial turmoil by a quantitative 
restriction of credit. In the euro area, while the annual 
growth rate of loans to the private sector increased to 
11.2% in August (and fo
llowing the cut-off date, to 
11.0% in September), the E
CB Bank Lending Survey 
for the third quarter of 2007 
expects a deterioration of 
credit conditions. 
If this were to become a global 
phenomenon, it could weigh appreciably on world 

growth.

%However, stock markets overcame the turmoil –
 Global equity prices also registered a correction in 
August 2007. This stemmed from a worsening of the 

situation on the US sub-prime 
mortgage markets, and 
subsequent decisions by major banks to temporarily 
close some funds. While this closure was purely 

technical, it triggered fears of an extension of the 
crisis to other markets. Th
e correction of equity prices was particularly severe for the banking sector. After 

the emergence of a shortage of liquidity on the money 
market, and the subsequent intervention of both the 
ECB and the Fed, banking shares lost up to 20%. 

However, they started to rebound on 17 August, when 
the Fed announced a cut in its discount rate by 50 bp.

 Since then, losses have been mostly recovered. Stock

After having eased to almo

 to increase again. They 
are now about 40% higher than at the beginning of the 
year, oscillating around the level of USD 80/bl. In 

euro terms, however, the increase is more limited.    
This increase comes from both supply-side and 
demand-side factors. From the supply side, 
geopolitical tensions are strong, especially regarding 

the Iran nuclear programme. In addition, US 
stockpiles of crude oil are decreasing, while 
bottlenecks persist in the 
refinery process. From the 
demand side, world oil demand is expected to 
continue to rise in the me
dium term, in connection 
with the buoyant GDP growth of emerging 
economies.

euro has continued to appreciate 
The euro reached an all-time high against the US 
dollar, trading abov
e 1.40 USD in October. This is an 
outcome of the relative downward revisions in 
expected GDP growth, which have been more 
significant for the US than for the euro area. In 

addition, the monetary policy loosening by the US 
Federal Reserve has reduced the interest rate 
differential between the two regions. Finally, the 

unwinding of yen carry-trades
 has also played a role, 
although a smaller one than what might have been 
expected from a US downturn. However, gains in 

nominal effective terms have been markedly more 
moderate, with an appreciation of about 3% on one 
year. Although the Japanese economy has recovered from 
the last recession, deflati
on persists and nominal key 
interest rates are still very low. As a result, the euro 
reached a new all-time high against the yen in July, 

before losing some ground af
ter the start of the 
financial market crisis. With th
e recovery of the stock 
market and the disappointing outturn for Japanese 
GDP growth in the second 
quarter of

ing close to its historical 
high against the yen, at about 160 JPY.

 While the weakness of the US dollar is improving US 
trade, thereby lowering the US current account deficit 
and global external imbala
nces, a continuous slide, 
particularly in isolation from
 other adjustment in other 
parities, would have kno
ck-on effects on the EU 
economies. Furthermore, the widening of the trade 
balance between China and both the EU and the US 
suggests that exchange rate misalignments persist. 
 Outlook by region 
World GDP is expected to 
ease slightly in 2007 and 
2008 to respectively 5.1% a
nd 4.7%, before edging up 
to 4.8% in 2009. Compared to the 2007 spring 
forecast, this represents an upward revision for this 

year which stems essen
tially from better-than-
expected growth in Asia (excluding Japan), Latin 
America and the CIS countries. However, the 

moderation of world GDP growth next year will be 
more pronounced than projected in the 2007 spring 
forecast, the discrepancy coming from the sharper-

than-expected slowdown of the US economy. In line 
with this scenario, world trade growth is also expected 
to gradually decelerate, from an estimated annual rate 

of around 9% in 2006 to around 7.8% in 2007 and 
7.1% in 2008, before rebo
unding to 7.7% in 2009.  
After three years of rap
id expansion, the US economy 
shifted to a growth path below trend last year. 
Between the second quarter
 of 2006 and the second 
quarter of 2007 real GDP increased by 1.9%. The 

slowdown has been concentrat
ed in the housing sector 
with declining 
residential investment subtracting 1 pp 
from GDP growth. Althou
gh house prices have started 
to decline and negativ
e wealth effects are likely to 
materialise in the near term, consumer spending has 
so far continued to expand at
 a solid rate. GDP growth 
should still reach 2.1% in 2007. 
However, the housing downturn has turned out to be 
more pronounced and more 
protracted than previously 
expected. This has led to a 
significant downward 
adjustment of projected GDP 
growth for next year to 
1.7%. The main reason is sharply lower consumer 
spending growth, as the fall-out from the housing 

correction takes hold. Business investment should 
also remain subdued, partly because of tighter credit 
conditions. On the other ha
nd, improving
 net exports 
will provide a considerable offset on overall economic 
activity against the backgroun
d of past dollar 
depreciation and robust gr
owth in many export 
markets. The housing recession is expected to bottom 
out in the second half of 
next year, which should 
allow the economy to
 recover slowly towards 
potential, resulting in annual growth of 2.6% in 2009.  
PH_711807_CEEChapter 1 The world economy 
 The Japanese economy
 should continue to grow at a 
moderate pace, decreasing to 1.9% in 2007 and 2008 
from 2.2% in 2006. While private consumption has 

proved to be rather stron
g, especially given the still 
decreasing nominal wages, business investment fell 
unexpectedly in the second quarter of 2007, leading to 

a contraction of GDP. However, private investment is 
expected to pick up rapidly,
 against the background of 
high corporate profits and a rising external demand, 

especially from the rest of Asia. At the same time, 
private consumption is projected to be supported by a 
moderate rise in household income, as wage growth is 

expected to gear up over the forecast horizon. For 
2009, GDP growth is set to edge up to 2.3%.    
Economic growth in the 
other Asian economies
 is 
expected to continue on a strong footing over the 

forecast period, although the aggregated regional 
growth figures mask variations across the different 
economies. On the one side, China and India are 

experiencing annual growth rates from 7% to 11%, 
while on the other side, the countries of South-East 
Asia are registering growth rates of about 5%. In 
2007, GDP growth in the whole region is set to reach 
8.8%, before decelerating modestly to 8.4% in 2008 

and to 8.2% in 2009.  
China's economic growth continues to exceed 
expectations, with a revised GDP growth rate of 
11.1% in 2006. After a slight deceleration at the end 

of 2006, the Chinese economy reaccelerated in the 
first six months of 200
7. Key factors behind this 
performance remain outst
anding growth in net 
merchandise exports and investment spending. While 
the deceleration in US imports should induce a slight 
deceleration in Chinese exports, they are still expected 

to expand by about 20% in 2007 and about 15% in 
2008. As a result, GDP growth
 should remain almost 
unchanged in 2007
, before easing slightly to 10.3% in 
2008. Such a projection assumes that the monetary 
and administrative measures undertaken by the 
government to cool the economy might at last have an 

impact, and that the slight appreciation of the 
renminbi in effective terms will continue. If so, GDP 
growth for 2009 should be 
contained at below 10%. 
Growth in 
India
 is also projected to moderate 
somewhat over the forecast period, from 9.2% in 2006 
to 7.6% in 2009. This gradual easing reflects the 

impact of previous monetary 
tightening and the recent 
appreciation of the rupee against the US dollar. In the 
rest of Asia, economic growth is expected to decrease 
slightly to below 5% in 2007 and 2008, except in 
Indonesia, whose growth rate is set to reach 6%. 

While divergences exist 
across countries, the general 
tendency is, for the contribution of domestic demand 
to GDP growth, to decline 
somewhat while exports 
remain buoyant. This is particularly the case for 
Korea, which could thus suffer more if the slowdown 
in the USA were to be 
sharper-than-expected, with some repercussions on its neighbours. However, 
Asian emerging economies seem to be weathering the 
US slowdown quite well up to now.   
The EFTA countries continue to enjoy strong growth. 
In Norway
, GDP growth is forecast at 2.9% in 2007 
and should increase to 
3.1% in 2008, before 
moderating to 2.2% in 2009. Domestic activity should 

continue to be the 
main driver of growth, supported 
by strong private consumption. In 
Switzerland
, GDP 
growth is expected to slow 
gradually in a context of 
tighter monetary policy and less buoyant international 
environment. The economy shoul
d expand at 2.3% in 
2007, before softening to 2.1% in 2008 and 2.0% in 
2009.  Economic growth in 
Turkey
 reached about 6% last 
year, but is expected to 
decrease to 5.1% in 2007. 
This moderation reflects the impact of monetary 
tightening measures, taken in the aftermath of the 
financial turbulence last year. However, activity is 
forecast to reaccelerate gradually to 6.5% in 2009, in 
line with potential growth. In 
Croatia
, strong 
domestic demand, partly fuelled by some pre-election 

spending, is likely to increase growth to 6% in 2007, 
before moderating to 5-5½% in 2008-09. In the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
 GDP 
growth continues to increase, from 3.1% in 2006 to an 
expected 5.0% in 2007, 5.5% 
in 2008 and 5.3% in 
2009.  The CIS region
 is the second-fastest-g
rowing region 
after developing Asia, with economic growth 
expected at 8.3% in 2007, 7.5% in 2008 and 7.1% in 
2009. Economic growth in 
Russia
 reached 6.7% in 
2006 and the forecast for 2007 has been revised 
upwards, to 7.7% compared 
to 6.8% in the spring 
forecast. The growth in domestic demand is still 
robust, as investment spending and consumption 
continue to accelerate. Furthermore, oil prices have 

rebounded after the softening observed at the turn of 
this year, boosting a still large current account surplus

Economic growth in

reach 5% for the year as a whole. The economic 
expansion has benefited from favourable external 

conditions, but is increasingl
y gaining support from domestic demand, on the back of lower real interest 
rates, strengthening labour markets and generally 

expanding credit. In line with the expected 
moderation in the world economy and emerging 
capacity constraints in some countries, GDP growth in 

the region is, however, expected to decelerate to 4.4% 
in 2008 and 4.2% in 2009. While most economies in 
the region have shown surpr
ising strength, growth in 
those economies that are most exposed to the US 
economy is likely to be lower than what was expected 
in spring. This is no
tably the case for Mexico. GDP growth in the 
MENA region
 reached 6.2% in 
2006, with most oil-importing countries performing 
better than the oil-exp
orting countries, as they reap 
the fruits of previous structural reforms. For 2007, 
real growth in the region is expected to reach 5.2% 
and remain over 5% in 2008 and 2009. In Saudi 

Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, domestic 
demand is expected to remai
n underpinned by oil 
export revenues, which are financing significant 

increases in public spending.  Buoyant foreign direct 
investment should also con
tinue to stimulate growth.  
In sub-Saharan Africa
, annual GDP growth is 
expected to reach 6.9% this year, after 5.8% in 2006. 

Domestic demand is accelerating markedly and is 
expected to contribute over 8 pps. to growth, 
supported by high oil revenues but also a dynamic 

non-oil sector. However, the external sector 
contribution remains negative,
 as imports are boosted 
by domestic demand. In 2008
 and 2009, GDP growth 
is expected to fall back to about 6½%, as domestic 
demand decelerates due to the tightening of both 
monetary and fiscal policies.

 GDP growth normalised in the first half of 2007 
while remaining dynamic– 
The economies of the euro area and the EU have seen 
a significant acceleration of economic activity since 

the beginning of 2006. Fo
llowing fairly weak growth 
in the early phase of the cyclical upswing, in 2006 
GDP grew by 3% in the EU and by 2.8% in the euro 

area. This was the best perform
ance since 2000 and 
above the potential growth 
rate in both regions. While 
the pick-up in economic activity largely reflected the 

strengthening of the cyclical
 upswing, some indicators 
suggest that structural improvements supporting an 
increase in growth potential may also be under way. 

There are signs of an increased
 resilience to global 
disturbances. The employment 
effect of recent output 
growth has been particularly intense. The acceleration 

of labour productivity might
 be more than just 
cyclical in nature. The structural unemployment rate 
has declined. 
Following the strong performan
ce in 2006, the EU 
and euro-area economies entered 2007 on a strong 
note, with quarter-on-quarter GDP growth of 0.8% in 
both regions. The deceleration of economic activity in 
the second quarter to 0.5% in the EU and just 0.3% in 
the euro area came as a surprise but should not be 

overstated. After five consecutive quarters of above 
potential growth, some normalisation had to be 
expected. In addition, mild weather boosted 
construction activity in the first quarter, thus 
adversely affecting growth 
in the second quarter. The 
downside surprise in the second quarter was also at 

odds with survey indicators, which did not suggest 
such a slowdown in econo
mic activity, particularly in 
the euro area. 
Disregarding the volatility 
of quarterly figures, the 
economy maintained co
nsiderable dynamism in the 
first half of 2007. Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth 
was, on average, 0.6% in the EU and 0.5% in the euro 

area, thus largely in line with the spring forecast. 
Underlying GDP growth as measured by the year-on-
year rate of change stood at 3.1% in the EU and 2.8% 
in the euro area over the same period. Nevertheless, 
economic activity in the EU and the euro area has 

probably passed its cyclical peak.  
Differences in GDP growth among the larger euro-
area Member States remained sizeable in the first half 
of 2007, with Spain posting an average quarter-on-

quarter growth rate of 1%,  the Netherlands 0.5%, 
France and Germany 0.4% and Italy 0.2%. Outside 
the euro area, GDP expanded by 0.8% in the UK 
(with the preliminary estimate for the third quarter at 

0.9%), was up by a healthy 1.5% in Poland while 
slowing to just 0.2% in Hungary. However, the 
dispersion of GD
P growth rates, as measured by the 
standard deviation, has not increased compared to 
2006. –underpinned by robust investment growth... 
The breakdown of GDP by demand component shows 
that gross fixed capital formation has been a 

significant stimulus to economic activity since early 
2006. Investment, which was rather subdued in the 
initial stages of the cycle, ha
s finally reached levels 
comparable to previous recoveries. The rising trend in 
gross fixed capital formation
 has gone hand in hand 
with a strong turnaro
und in corporate profitability 
owing to moderate increases in
 labour costs and to a 
rise in labour produ
ctivity growth.  In the euro area, the nomin
al gross operating surplus 
of corporations, which may be interpreted as a proxy 
for corporate profits, grew, on average, at a solid 
4.5% per year over the 2000-2006 period. In the first 

quarter of 2007, the gross op
erating surplus stood at 
40.3% as a share of GDP, a record high, and remained 
above 40% also in 
the second quarter.

each year between 2004 and 2006 in both the EU and

wage dynamics. Despite the strong acceleration of 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  euro-area economic activity in 2006, the annual 
growth rate of compensation per employee was 2.4% 
(in nominal terms), broadly unchanged from the pace 

of growth that prevailed in
 the first half of the decade 
when economic activity was more subdued. In 
addition, the rise in labour 
costs has been dampened 
by the rebound in labour pr
oductivity which rose at an 
average annual pace of 1.3% between the first quarter 
of 2006 and the second quar
ter of 2007, well above 
the 0.5% growth rate of the previous five years. While 
there is evidence of a recent mild acceleration of 
wages in specific sectors and Member States, wage 

growth in the euro area 
is still projected at a moderate 
2.6% for the year 2007 as a whole. 
The strength of corp
orate investment is also visible in 
corporate borrowing data. Le
nding to non-financial 
corporations has been on the rise since the beginning 
of 2004 and the year-on-year growth rate at the end of 
2006 was already higher than the prev
ious peak in late 
2000. Growth in 
loans to non-fina
ncial corporations strengthened further in the first half of 2007 and stood 
at 14.2% (year-on-year) in August.  
Recent financial turbulence has shaken investor 
confidence and shou
ld cause tigh
ter credit conditions and tamer investment activity going forward, 

particularly in the con
struction sector. However, with 
business sentiment in industry and services still 
upbeat at the beginning of 
the fourth qu
arter of 2007 
(although moderating in both cases), capacity 
utilisation rates reported to be
 above the long-term 
average, sound corporate balance sheets and

–and consumption gathering pace– 
Last year private consumption expanded by 1.8% in 
the euro area and 2.2% in the EU, gathering pace 

compared to the subdued performance observed in the 
early stages of the economic upt
urn. In the first 
quarter of 2007, private 
consumption was adversely 
affected by the VAT increase in Germany, but gained 
momentum in the second quarter, expanding by 0.5% 
(quarter-on-quarter) in both the euro area and the EU, 
thereby becoming the main engine of growth. 
Excluding the VAT effect, private consumption has 

been on a broad 2% growth path since the beginning 
of 2006.  The initially weaker development of private 
consumption compared to previous recoveries 
mirrored employment gro
wth, which remained 
sluggish for several quarters
 after the turnaround in 
economic activity in mid-
2003. In addition, wage 
growth remained subdued 
for a prolonged period in 
some euro-area Member States, particularly in 
Germany. This was a welcome means to restore 
competitiveness. Howev
er, it also acted as a brake on 
the growth of household income and thereby on 
private consumption. Since
 the beginning of 2006, 
employment growth has pi
cked up significantly and 
contributed to a more robust expansion of private 
consumption both by increasing the number of people 
in employment and by 
strengthening consumer 
confidence.  
Employment growth accelerated to 1.3% last year in 
the euro area (1.5% in the EU), up from 0.3% growth 
on average in the previous three years (0.5% in the 

EU). As a result, close to 2 million new jobs were 
created in 2006 in the euro area (more than 3.5 
million in the EU). Consumer spending continued to 
receive support from the improving labour market 
also in 2007, with euro-area employment increasing at 

an annual pace of 1.8% in the 
first half of this year 
(1.4% in the EU). At the same time, the 
unemployment rate continued to fall, reaching 7.3% 

in September 2007 in 
the euro area (7.0% in the EU), 
the lowest level since 1993. While the fall in the 
unemployment rate is largely attributable to the strong 

cyclical upswing, available estimates also point to a 
fall in the structural rate of unemployment, suggesting 
that earlier labour market reforms are starting to bear 

fruit. PH_711807_CEEChapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU

 Indicators of private consum
ption point to
 continuous, 
albeit somewhat moderated, growth in the second half 
of the year. According to the Commission's most 

recent business and consumer survey, consumer 
confidence is still fairly strong, consumers™ fears of 
unemployment are decreasing and the assessment of 

the general economic c
onditions is improving. 
However, households' willingness 
to buy in 
the future has not improved and neither has their assessment of 

their own financial situatio
n. Confidence in the retail 
sector declined sharply in September, due to a 
significant worsening in retailers' assessment of both 

the present and expected business situation. The 
recent financial turmoil is likely to affect consumer 
confidence and thus dampen consumption growth. 
As for financial developmen
ts, credit to the household 
sector remains sustained. The annual growth rate of 
loans to households stood at 7% in August 2007, 
unchanged compared to the previous month, pointing 
to a modest impact of recent financial developments 
on household borrowing so far.  However, growth in 

loans to the household sector has moderated 
appreciably since the peak observed in spring 2006. 
This is in line with the mode
ration in the rise in house 
prices and in housing activity
 in a number of Member 
States over the past few quarters and the gradual 
upward trend in
 mortgage rates. 
 –with exports still supporting growth despite 
some headwinds. Last year net foreign demand 
contributed 0.3 pp. to 
GDP growth in the euro area (0.1 
pp. in the EU) and a 
similar contribution was envisage
d in the first half of 
2007. This was largely due
 to the very strong 
performance of exports, 
across several euro-area 
countries. The impact of the appreciation of the euro 
on euro-area exports was thus fairly contained. The 

broadening of world growth and 
the concomitant shift 
in the geographical composition of euro-area exports 
in favour of Asian and oil-exporting economies more 

than offset the slowdown 
in the economic activity of 
some key trading partners, particularly the USA.

ted 8% to total euro-area 
export growth and a contribution of 21% came from 
the oil exporters, the CIS, Norway and the OPEC

of exports outside the euro area in 2006 and 

contributed only 5% to the growth of these exports. 
The good performance of euro-area exports observed 
up to now despite the sizeable appreciation of the euro

possibility that a further strength

have adverse non-linear effects on export growth. 
PH_711807_CEE2. Financial market turmoil increases 
economic uncertainty  Uncertainty about future course of financing 
conditions 
The current forecast is characterised by higher than 
usual uncertainty, due to ongo
ing problems in the 
functioning of several key 
financial markets and the 
resulting uncertainty about the future course of 
financing conditions. The tu
rmoil, which has persisted 
over many weeks, is increasingly likely to impact on 
the real economy through a tightening in credit 
conditions. The extent of this credit tightening will 
ultimately depend on how long it takes for normality 
to be restored in the 
affected financial markets which 
remains an open question.   
The trigger for problems in financial markets has been 
the deterioration in 
the US housing market, as 
reflected in accelerating rates of defaults on higher-
risk or sub-prime mortg
age loans. While the 
associated financial losses are sm
all relative to the 
size of the international financial system, they have 
triggered a generalised collapse of investor confidence in those securities and instituti
ons with potential sub-
prime exposure. These effects have not been confined 
to the United States. Europe
an financial markets have 
also experienced 
problems of disruption and 
dislocation, even though su
b-prime mortgage lending 
is much less prevalent in Europe.  
Problems in the US sub-prime lending have impacted 
on the international financial system because of the 
way in which the associated credit risks have been 

managed. Although the su
b-prime mortgage loans 
were originated by US mo
rtgage lenders and retail 
banks, they were sold on to
 other financial institutions 
in the secondary market. 
These institutions securitised the loans and bundled th
em together with other 
securities Œ based on prime mo
rtgage loans or loans 
raised by companies Œ 
to create marketable securities 
known as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). 
CDOs were then subdivided 
into tranches, with risk 
categories ranging from very high risk (junk) to very 
low (AAA). Each tranche was assessed by a credit 
rating agency and sold on this basis to investors, 
including hedge funds, pension funds, insurance 
companies and banks. In this way, the credit risk 

associated with US sub-prime mortgage loans was 
distributed around the g
lobal financial system. 
  Money markets have been among those most 
disrupted by the loss of investor confidence. Central 
banks have been required to intervene on many 

occasions to support the smooth functioning of these 
markets by providing emerge
ncy liquidity. Moreover, 
the financial turmoil has impacted on the stance of 

monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has lowered 
both the discount rate (the ra
te at which banks borrow 
from the Federal Reserve) 
and the target for the 
federal funds rate (the rate at which banks borrow 
from each other) in response to growing concern 
about the implications of th
e financial turmoil. Both 
the ECB and the Bank of 
England, which until the 
summer were widely expected to raise interest rates, 
responded to uncertainty in financial markets by 

holding their policy rates unchanged, while signalling 
a continued vigilance as 
regards inflationary 
developments.

Money markets particularly disrupted 
The financial-market turmoil h
as led to a typical flight 
to quality, although some cal
m has been restored to 
markets in recent weeks. During 
the initial flight to 
safety, interest rates on most liquid government paper 
and sovereign bonds declined sharply, leading to an 
increase in spreads across sovereign issuers with 

similar ratings but less liquid markets. The increased 
risk aversion has been also visible in a sharp rise in 
investor perceptions of 
default probabilities and wider 
spreads on corporate and emerging market bonds. 
Recently, though, a partial relaxation can be observed. 

Equity prices initially fell sharp
ly, but recovered in 
the wake of expected and then realised US interest 
rate cuts. However, sentiment
 in equity markets 
PH_711807_CEEChapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
 remains volatile and the recovery in prices has not 
been uniform, with large 
multinational corporations 
generally outperforming smaller firms.  
Several key financial mark
ets are still not functioning 
properly. In the interbank markets, interest rates for 
maturities longer than a few days remain at elevated 
levels. Problems in the 
functioning of the interbank 
market reflect a combination of perceived 
counterparty risk related to 
sub-prime exposures and, 
particularly more, reluctance among market 

participants to make multi-day loans because of 
concerns about future liqu
idity needs. As a result, 
interest-rate spreads, e.g. between 3-month interbank 

lending rates and the respective average risk-free rate 
on euro-area government bills, have widened 
significantly.

Credit conditions have tightened 
The abrupt re-pricing of ri
sk sparked by the financial 
turmoil has led to a tightening of credit conditions, 
which is likely to persist 
going forward. The precise 
extent and duration of such
 tightening is, however, 
difficult to predict.      
The sharp decline in th
e value of some financial assets 
held by the financial sector since end-July can be seen 
as a balance-sheet shock for banks and the financial 

system overall, which is likely 
to reduce the ability 
and willingness of institution
s to provide credit. In 
addition, a reduced scope to transfer credit risk via 

securitisation implies higher lending interest rates and 
tighter lending standards. In turn, lower levels of 
lending activity will reduce bank profits.

 Tighter credit conditions are visible in the results of 
the latest ECB bank lending survey. The survey of 
changes in bank lending standards made during the 

third quarter of 2007 indicates that a net 31% of all 
euro-area banks tightened their credit conditions vis-
à-vis corporate borrowers (31% of all banks 
tightening and none easing) and a net 28% of banks 
expected standards to tighten in the fourth quarter. A 

net 12% of banks also indicated a tightening of 
lending standards on mortgage lending in the third 
quarter (22% tightening a
nd 10% easing) and a net 
15% of banks expected to furt
her tighten in the fourth 
quarter. The survey also revealed that banks have not 
yet tightened standards on ot
her household sector loan 
categories, but expect to tighten them in the fourth 
quarter. 
Negative but uncertain impact on economic sectors 
Due to the strong profitability of recent years, 
corporate balance sheets seem well placed on average 

to withstand the tigh
tening credit conditions. However, external financing
 demand has risen sharply 
in the past two years with 
bank lending to the non-
financial corporate sector in the euro area at record 
high levels. This has partly reflected a corresponding 
expansion in investment activ
ity but also high levels 
of M&A activity.  The aggregate growth rate of bank credit to the 
corporate sector hides c
onsiderable differences 
between Member States. In August 2007, lending was 
up by about 30% year-on-year
 in Ireland, Spain and 
Slovenia. In contrast bank le

only 4% in Germany. In the face of these continuing

 Debt-servicing costs are also trending higher, 
although they remain belo
w the peak levels recorded 
in 2001. While a further rise in debt-servicing costs 
relative to income would 
seem tolerable on the basis 
of historical experience, tighter credit conditions 

could have a more severe impact if consumer demand 
were to deteriorate as well.  
In recent years, EU households have taken advantage 
of a low interest-rate environment to accumulate 
record levels of debt, main
ly to finance housing 
investments. In the euro area,
 the ratio of household 
debt to (gross) disposable income has risen to 90% 
from roughly 70% in 1999
, while the ratio to GDP has 
risen to 59% from about 45% over the same period. 
However, household interest payments to banks 
remain below the levels reco
rded in 2000/01. In 
contrast to the United States, the EU has only a 

limited market for sub-prime 
mortgages and the risk 
of mortgage default seems much lower. However, the 
prevalence of variable-rate mortgages in some 

Member States with high h
ousehold debt levels is a 
source of concern as it might
 imply higher servicing 
costs for households. Another 
concern relates to the 
implications of a past weakening of lending standards 
for credit quality and therefore credit risk going 
forward. 
In this context, the key fact
or influencing households™ 
wealth and confidence going ahead will be the 
evolution of housing markets. House prices are 
already decelerating from earlier elevated levels, in 
particular in markets where prices have increased 

most (possibly to overvalued 
levels). The evolution of 
credit standards and house prices will also impact on 
residential construction, whic
h has been an important 
driver of GDP growth in many countries over the last 
few years. Construction could suffer from tighter 
credit conditions both 
directly and indirectly via 
housing-market developments. 
Some catching-up EU economies might be 
vulnerable 
The financial turmoil has 
not had a significant impact 
on catching-up economies, possibly
 due to their lower 
exposure to sophisticated fi
nancial products. Some of 
the Member States in Central and Eastern Europe 
were affected by the initial phase of the turmoil, 

experiencing currency depreci
ation, widening risk 
premia and declining equity prices. However, most of 
these effects eased subsequently. Nevertheless, the 

durable tightening in credit conditions, which is likely 
to follow the current fin
ancial turmoil, increases the 
risks for these economies. Those Member States with 
larger external financing needs (which in some cases 
rely extensively on short-
term capital inflows) are 
particularly vulnerable. Any sharp reduction in access 
to external financing would directly affect housing 
markets and consumption (directly via reduced 

availability of credit and indirectly via wealth effects).  
 
 
 PH_711807_CEEChapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
  Box 2.2.1:
 'Quand le bâtiment va, tout va'
Housing markets in several EU countries have been 
buoyant over the past decade, driven by low interest 
rates and Œ in some cases Œ dynamic demographics, but 
some cooling has been apparent lately and more may be 
in store. Among the largest countries, France, the 
United Kingdom and Spain have posted two-digit rates 
of house price increases in real terms for several years 
in a row since the turn of the century. They have now 
experienced sharp losses in price momentum and this is 
also reflected in a slowdown in residential construction 
activity Œ although not to the same extent as in the 
United States. 
The greater synchronisation of housing cycles across 
countries in recent decades has raised concern that a 
downturn in housing markets could trigger a recession 
in the near term. While a soft landing appears a likely 
prospect in most cases, a disorderly correction of house 
prices would pose risks for macroeconomic and 
possibly financial stability. There are essentially three 
channels through which a downturn in housing markets 
could affect overall economic activity: 
1. A fall in house prices in real terms could affect 
household consumption either via saving responses to 
households™ perceived wealth or via effects on 
mortgage borrowing stemming from lower estimates of 
housing collateral for mortgage equity withdrawal. 
Such consumption responses can be expected to be 
more marked in countries where financial markets 
provide easy access to household credit and to financial 
products that facilitate mortgage equity withdrawal. The 
strength of the aggregate wealth effect also crucially 
depends on the home ownership rate. 
2. House prices and the underlying supply and demand 
conditions may have an important effect on private 
residential investment. Changes in the profitability of 
housing investment affect the construction sector as 
well as employment and demand in property-related 
sectors. Several factors affect the sensitivity of 
construction activity. In particular, supply constraints in 
the form of planning restrictions, the availability of land 
or the competitive conditions in the construction sector 
may play a significant role in restraining the growth of 
housing investment in upturns and hence create pent-up 
demand which can thenact as a buffer during the 
downturn. 
3. Sharp downward corrections in asset markets or other 
sources of stress in financial markets, e.g. the recent 
turmoil triggered by the sub-
prime crisis, can have large 
effects on the banking sector. If financial intermediaries 
misjudge risks, underestimating them in good times and 
overestimating them in bad times, the potential for 
credit and asset booms to derail and turn into busts is 
substantial. In this context, the pro-cyclicality of bank 
provisioning is a concern. Banks may be reluctant to 
make adequate provision for loan losses when housing 
markets are buoyant. Hence, when a crisis strikes, this 
could lead to a credit squeeze affecting other sectors. 
In this context it may be useful to examine past 
behaviour of EU economies during housing downturns 
and to compare this with the experience in non-EU 
economies.  A priori EU economies may be expected to 
display a lower sensitivity of consumption, residential 
investment and overall activity to swings in housing 
markets than non-EU economies. The main reason is 
that planning restrictions and credit constraints on 
households are generally tighter in most EU countries 
than in many non-EU countries (such as the United

confirmed by the data. Real house prices and residential 
construction are generally more volatile around turning 
points in the non-EU sample than in EU countries and 
so are household consumption and real GDP growth.

contribution of roughly the same magnitude. The 
growth rate of household consumption and GDP have 
also tended to respond strongly, with the former 
plummeting from roughly 3½ % (annual rate) prior to 
the housing peak to close to nil one year after the 
housing peak, the latter falling from around 3% to 
almost -1% after 1½ years.  
The evidence presented above suggests that 
developments in the housing market may affect growth, 
via their impact on consumption and investment. In the 
past few years, household consumption and investment 
have probably benefited from the strong increases in 
house prices observed in some EU countries, 
particularly in the UK, Denmark, Finland, Spain and 

France. Housing price effects are usually identified as 
stronger in Anglo-Saxon countries than in the euro area. 
Although empirical research has largely focused on the 
wealth effects of house prices, the role of housing 
markets in the transmission of monetary policy should 
not be overlooked. Housing markets will amplify the 
impact of changes in monetary policy if the mortgage 
rates are closely linked to change to base rates because 
they are predominately based on variable interest rates. 
Residential mortgage loans in the euro area typically 
fall into two groups, fixed-interest-rate countries and 
variable-rate countries. The first group includes 
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands 
and Sweden. The second group includes Greece, Spain, 
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and the UK.  
The importance of interest rates and mortgage lending 
conditions also clearly varies with owner-occupation 
levels. In countries such as Germany, Denmark, the 
Netherlands, France, Austria and Finland, which have 

larger private rented sectors, mortgage interest rates 
will tend to have less of an impact on household 
finances and so on consumer spending than in countries 
such as Spain, Greece, Italy and Ireland where owner-
occupation rates are higher.

 Around potential in 2008 and 2009 
Following two years of 
above-potential growth, annual GDP growth in 2008 and 2009 is projected to 
fall back to around
 potential in both 
the euro area and 
the EU, around 2.2% and 2.4% respectively. In both 
regions, GDP growth in 2007 is unchanged compared 
to the spring forecast, but growth in 2008 is revised 

down by 0.3 pp. The downwar
d revision is mainly 
due to tighter financing conditions, which are 
expected to slice 0.7 pp off investment growth (in 

both regions).  
Going into 2009, the con
tribution of the foreign 
balance improves (to +0.1 pp in the euro area and to 
neutral in the EU), while domestic demand 

decelerates. In the EU, this leaves GDP growth at the 
same rate as in 2008, while euro-area GDP slows 
down in 2009.  
This outcome at the aggreg
ate level is the result of 
diverging developments across Member States. For a 
majority of euro-area Member States, growth is 
revised  upward in 2007. The unchanged figure for the 
euro area as a whole is due mainly to a downward 
revision of growth in Fran
ce by 0.5 pp. On the other 
hand, the downward revi
sed EU growth figure for 
2008 is a reflection of similar revisions for a majority 
of Member States, with significan
t upward revisions observed only for Sloveni
a, Finland, Lithuania and 
Slovakia. Finally, growth is expected to decelerate in 

2009 in many Member States, due largely to 
subsiding construction in
vestment, but this is 
balanced by an assumed acceleration of growth in 

Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. 
Domestic demand will remain 
the main driving force 
of activity, although its contribu
tion to growth is 
expected to diminish over the forecast horizon. While 

domestic demand growth will be relatively stable in 
Germany, France and Italy, it is foreseen to slow 
down in most other Member States.  
Consumption growth restrained by subdued real 
income growth 
The modest evolution of domestic demand is closely 
linked to the development of private consumption. At 
around 2.3% average annual growth over 2006-2009, 

EU consumption growth remains far below the 1997-
2001 average (of 2.9%), contributing only about 1
 pp to output growth (between 1 and 1¼ pp. in the euro 
area). In the euro area, the uneven evolution of 
consumption over the forecast period is mainly due to 

the effects of the VAT increase in Germany.  
PH_711807_CEEChapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
 The excellent performance of the main labour market 
indicators in the EU seems to be at odds with the 
development of consumption. Employment growth, 

while decelerating somewhat after 2007, remains 
brisk, bringing the EU unemployment rate down to 
6.4% of the labour force in 2009.

forecast
EUeuro 
area
 While the number of employed persons rises 
considerably over the forecast horizon, their income 
evolution is not supportive of a more dynamic profile 

of consumption. Although growth of real 
compensation per employee is expected to pick up in 
2008, continuing its acceleration since 2005, it 

remains moderate compared to previous peaks. 
Growth of real compensa
tion per employee is 
projected to remain below 1½% in the EU and the 
euro area. These projections are based on the 
assumption that increased la
bour market flexibility 
and competitive pressures from globalisation will 
continue to restrain domestic wage dynamics even at a 
time of low unemployment.  
Besides real income growth, consumption is also held 
back by an essentially stable 
household saving rate. In 
2007, the saving rate is projected to increase in 
Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Austria and 

Sweden, while declining in most other Member 
States. Whereas in the case of Germany the increase 
could be seen as a result of the VAT hike, the rises in 

other Member States are more difficult to explain.

 Rises in most of these Member States' saving rates do 
not seem to be due to confidence effects. Consumer 
confidence has not been significantly affected by 

events in financial mark
ets. Even after its three-point 
decline since May 2007, EU consumer confidence is 
still far above its long-term average. Besides specific 

national policy measures, income-distribution effects 
may have influenced Member States' aggregate saving 
rates, as high-income households with a relatively 

high saving propensity seem to have benefited 
proportionally more from the economic expansion 
than low-income households.  
Finally, in some Member States, depending on the 
characteristics of the nat
ional housing market, 
ongoing and expected 
downward corrections in the 
housing market might lead 
to a reduction in expected 
household wealth, reducing 
the propensity to consume 
out of current income. In 2008-2009, upward and 

downward movements in the saving rate in different 
Member States cancel each other out, leaving the EU 
saving rate stable, thus offering
 no additional support 
to consumption growth.  
Resilient investment in equipment 
Investment was the major sup
port to GDP growth in 
2006 and 2007. In a majority of Member States, the 
growth rate of investment in 2007 was revised 

upwards. This is also the case for the aggregate EU 
level, notwithstanding downward revisions in some 
larger countries (France, Italy and the United 

Kingdom). In 2008, total i
nvestment in the EU is 
expected to decelerate to around
 3½% (from 5½% in 
2007). In 2009, investment should grow at the same

 pace, with a further slowdown in a majority of 
Member States being counterbalanced by a re-
acceleration in Ireland and the United Kingdom. 
Investment in equipment 
is projected to grow at 
respectable rates, of around 
4%, during 2008 and 
2009 in both the EU and the euro area, following 
growth of around 7% in 2007, the fastest pace since 

2000. This strong performance may seem surprising 
in view of the results of the October ECB Bank 
Lending Survey. The survey reported a tightening of 

credit standards in the euro area in the third quarter of 
2007 and expects a further credit tightening in the 
period ahead. However, the survey is a snapshot of 

the situation taken at the end of September, and, if 
financial markets normalise, as this forecast assumes, 
it can be expected that credit standards will normalise 

as well. The impact on investment plans of firms 
outside the financial sector 
will also be cushioned by 
the current high profitability which limits their 

reliance on lending for 
investment purposes. 
Moreover, fundamentals are still supportive of 
investment in equipment. In the manufacturing sector, 
the capacity utilisation rate exceeded the maximum of 
the 1999-2000 expansion in Ap
ril 2007, though it then saw a small decline of 0.7 pp in July. However, at 

83.7%, the present rate of manufacturing capacity 
utilisation in the EU is still 2 pps
. above the long-term 
average. Judging from the monthly business survey in 
industry, short-term demand prospects are still 

favourable, with a high level of order books and 
above-average production expectations.

 The upbeat picture fr
om industry contrasts with the 
prospects for the service sector. In view of the 
subdued development of consumption, the optimism 
in the service sector has not matched the dynamism of 

industry during recen
t years. This is reflected in 
PH_711807_CEEChapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
 sectoral confidence indicators, with services 
confidence barely above its long-term average 
(whereas industrial confidence is close to historical 

highs). Specifically, in the light of possible problems 
in the financial sector emanating from the financial 
market turmoil, equipment investment in the services 

sector is likely to be less dynamic than in industry. 
A significant housing market correction in some 
Member States 
Regarding investment 
in construc
tion, residential investment is expected to slow down markedly, while 

developments for public and corporate investment in 
construction should be smoother. In particular, for 
corporate construction investment the development 

should be largely in line 
with that of equipment 
investment, i.e. growth shou
ld hold up well, with 
industry doing better than services.  
As to housing investment, the situation varies 
significantly across Member States. Some countries 
(such as Ireland and Spain) have experienced 
considerable rises in house 
prices in the past few 
years, while in others (like Germany) house prices 
have more or less stagnated. Accordingly, tighter 

credit conditions across the EU will have a 
differentiated impact across Member States, with the 
effect being determined by the house market 

characteristics of each country. In particular, countries 
where flexible-rate loans are more widespread can be 
expected to be more exposed to a change in credit 

conditions. Overall, however, while concerns exist 
regarding some mortgage 
markets, the problem 
should remain contained as, 
on average, leverage in 
Europe is smaller than in the US. 
Notwithstanding tightening 
financing conditions, the 
forecast for growth in construction investment in 2007 
is revised up in a majority of Member States. But 

there are also some downward revisions, particularly 
for Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Ireland 
(where a contraction of about 3% is now foreseen, 

instead of an expansion of the same size in the 
spring), which limit the upward revision for the euro 
area as whole to 0.4 pp. In 2008, growth in euro-area 
construction investment is
 revised downwards to 
2.2%, with Ireland (and Denmark outside the euro 

area) expected to see a contraction of construction 
investment. Anaemic growth in construction 
investment will also continue
 in 2009, with a growth 
rate of merely 1.3% in the euro area, a figure that is 
significantly influenced by
 a contraction in Spain, 
where construction investment is projected to fall by 
more than 3%. 
Exports benefit from buoyant demand from 
emerging markets and oil exporters 
As detailed in Chapter 1, b
uoyant developments in 
emerging markets are expected to compensate for the 
weakness of US growth. 
GDP growth in the world 
excluding the EU should
, as a result, remain firm, 
dropping slightly to 5.3% in 2008 (from 5.6% in 
2007), before re-accelerating to 5.4% in 2009. As 

would be expected, world trade growth shows the 
same pattern.  
Against this background, EU
 exports of goods and 
services are projected to slow down, from 6.3% in 

2007 to 5.8% in 2008 and 2009. The EU as a whole is 
expected to limit its market sh
are loss to less than 1% 
annually, which suggests that 
EU exports seem to be 
relatively little affected by exchange rate 
developments. This is partly due to the fact that, 
according to Commission estimates, EU exports react 
more strongly to global trade developments than to 
movements in the exchange rate. Moreover, exchange 

rate developments have been 
narrower than suggested 
by the bilateral EURŒUSD rate. In real effective 
terms, the euro-area exchange rate appreciated by 

2½% YoY in 2007, against a increase of around 10% 
in the bilateral EURŒUSD rate.

 Business survey results confirm
 the benign short-term 
export outlook. The ECFIN indicator for export order 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  books is still very close 
to its all-time high. The 
export order index from the PMI manufacturing 
survey dropped in September to
 its lowest value since 
August 2005, but rema
ins above its long-term 
average. EU exporters are expected to continue to 
benefit from two "regional" factors. The first one is 

the buoyancy of demand from emerging markets, 
which seems to give a 
particular boost to capital 
goods producers. The second factor is so-called oil-

bill recycling. With oil 
prices assumed to stay above 
70 USD/barrel throughout the forecast period, EU 
exporters will further enjoy buoyant demand from oil 

exporters, who source a 
large share of their imports 
from the EU.  
Cumulated over the forecast period, the euro area is 
expected to lose about 4% of its export market share 

(and the EU 2%), with a 
wide dispersion across 
Member States, largely in lin
e with competitiveness 
developments. Among the euro-area Member States 

that are set to lose less market share than the euro-area 
average, strongly different current-account situations 
are found. Five countrie
s (Belgium, Germany, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlan
ds and Austria) are 
expected to increase their current account surplus to at 

least 3% of GDP in 2009. Greece, Portugal and Spain, 
on the other hand, are proj
ected to retain their large 
current account deficits in 2009 (in excess of 8% of 

GDP). While, for Greece and Portugal, this would 
mean a slight reduction of the deficit over the 
forecasting period, for Spain a clear deceleration in 

the rising trend is observed. 
Among non-euro-area Member States, current account 
divergences are even wider. Developments are 
noteworthy in several countries. Hungary and 

Slovakia are set to gain large market shares and 
consequently reduce their current account deficit by a 
substantial amount. By cont
rast, five non-euro-area 
Member States are projected to 
continue to post large 
(double-digit) current account deficits in 2009. 
Among these five countries, improvements compared 

to 2007 are foreseen for Bulgaria (to 17.6% of GDP), 
Estonia (to 10.9%) 
and Latvia (to 19.8%), while a 
deterioration is expected for 
Lithuania (to 14.6%) and 
Romania (to 16.2%). 
PH_711807_CEE4. Continued strength of the labour market 
 The labour market continued to benefit from the 
growth momentum in 2007 in both the euro area and 
the EU. Due to the lagged response of employment to 

GDP growth and the maturing cycle, a deceleration in 
the employment dynamics will become visible in 
2008-2009. Overall though, employment growth will 
be sustained and unemployment should keep 
declining over the forecast horizon. Robust employment growth in 2007  
Boosted by strong economic activity in the past few 
quarters, employment in Europe is expected to grow 

by 1½% in 2007, up by 0.2 pp. in the euro area 
compared to 2006, and at a strong pace for the second 
year in a row in the case of the EU. Although not as 

fast as in the year 2000, 
this pace of employment 
growth fares well in a hi
storical perspective. In 
individual countries, positive 
surprises have led to 
sizeable upward revisions in 2007 compared to the 
spring forecast, especially for Germany, the 
Netherlands (+0.7 pp.), 
Finland (+0.8 pp.) and 
Slovenia (+1.5 pps).

By contrast, employment gr
owth has been revised 
down by 0.4 pp. in Port
ugal and 0.1 pp. in Italy and 
Ireland. The increase in job creation in Germany was 
encouraging, in that the jobs created were mainly 

regular jobs (e.g. full-time,
 paying social security 
contributions). Employment growth appears well 
balanced across Member States. In the euro area, only 

France, Italy, and Portugal will see much slower 
growth than the average. 
Outside the euro area, the news is also good 
(especially from Poland), en
suring on the whole a 
high level of job creation. All sectors have benefited 
from the revival of the labour market, as well as the 
various types of work arrangements (e.g. part-time, 

full-time, permanent and fixed-term contracts). The 
labour market improvement across components 
reflects inter alia past structural reforms and the 
increased confidence of firms, due to the sustained 
economic activity. 
Unemployment at its lowest  
As a result of the 
positive labour market 
developments, in the summer of 2007 the euro-area 

unemployment rate reached its lo
west point in fifteen 
years. For the year as a whole, the unemployment rate 
is expected to decline to 7.3% in 2007 in the euro area 

and to 7.1% in the EU, from 8.3% in the euro area and 
8.2% in the EU in 2006. The unemployment rate has 
dropped by 1 pp. between 2006 and 2007 in both 

regions. Following a major revision in the 
unemployment series in Germany, the euro-area and 
EU unemployment rates in September declined to 

7.3% and 7.0%, respectively (see Eurostat press 
release 149/2007 of 31 October 2007), and represent a 
level shift compared
 with the spring
 forecast, but the 
trend continues to decline.

up to the third quarter of

employment growth going forward. Employment 

prospects reported in the Commission's business and

creation should continue towards the end of the year, 

especially in the services sector, while indications 
from the manufacturing sector are more mixed. The

 Labour market outlook for 2008-09 
Further ahead, employment growth is projected to 
moderate to slightly below 1% per annum in both the 
euro area and the EU. This change is especially due to 
a deceleration in employment growth in Germany, 

Spain, and Italy, as well as other smaller Member 
States. Employment growth in the euro area should 
continue to decelerate gradually towards the long-

term average in 2009, an
d it is foreseen to slow 
markedly in the EU, from 1.5%
 in 2007, to 0.9% in 
2008 and 0.8% in 2009. This deceleration is due to the 

drop in employment growth in most euro-area 
countries, but also in
 Poland (from 4.4% in 2007 to 
1.3% in 2009) and in Sweden and Denmark (with 
strong declines of around 2 pps).  
As unemployment keeps dropping– 
The unemployment rate is expected to decline to 7.1% 
in 2008 and 2009 in the eur
o area and to 6.8% in 2008 
and 6.6% in 2009 
in the EU. For 2
008, the decline in 
both regions is driven by developments in Germany 
and the Netherlands. Outside the euro area, 

unemployment rates are foreseen to decline across the 
board in 2008-2009, except in the United Kingdom 
and Estonia, where they remain 
broadly constant, and 
in Lithuania, which is th
e only country where the rate 
is expected to increase. Following a methodological 
change in the unemployment series in Germany, the 

German, EU and euro area rates were revised at the 
end of October.  
– labour markets tighten  
As the actual unemployment rate keeps declining, so 
does the structural unem
ployment rate (NAIRU), 
which is estimated to reach 7.1% in the euro area and 
6.6% in the EU by 2009. As the actual unemployment 
rate declines and equals the estimated level of the 
structural rate in 2009 in both regions, wage pressures 
could become more prominent.

PH_711807_CEEChapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
 Still moderate wage developments On the back of a tighter labour market situation, real 
compensation of employees in the euro area is 
expected to increase over the forecast horizon from 

0.2% in 2006 to 0.7% in 2007, and 1.0% in 2008 
before easing slightly to 0.8% in 2009. This profile is 
essentially due to developmen
ts in Germany, Finland 
and Slovenia, where compensation per employee 
increases in 2008, but then decelerates again in 2009. 
The spike in 2008 is du
e partly to temporary 
developments and catching-up on previous years of 
wage restraint. In contrast, real compensation per 
employee is projected to fall slightly in Spain. 

Turning to the EU, a similar
 pattern develops across 
the forecast horizon, with 0.9% in 2007, 1.4% and 
1.3% in the subsequent y
ears. However, this overall 
acceleration in 2008 appears temporary, as it peters 
out in 2009. These growth rates are nevertheless 
above the long-term averages of the past ten years for 

the euro area and the EU as a whole (of around +0.5% 
and 1.1% per annum, respectively).

Growth of real unit labour costs and 
                      productivity, euro area
 In view of the wage restraint in recent years and the 
tightening in the la
bour market a gradual 
normalisation of wage behaviour could have been 

expected in 2007-2009. However, the projections 
suggest continued moderate wage developments. A 
possible explanation for 
this is pressure from 
international competition, 
which diminishes the 
bargaining power of workers, implying a possible 
structural change in wage formation.  
In this context, unit labour costs are set to continue to 
grow at a very moderate pace, by 1½ to 2%. Unit 
labour costs in the euro area are expected to increase 
in 2008 (to 1.8%) and then return to 1.5% in 2009 per 
annum, which translates into
 negative growth of real 
unit labour costs. This should 
continue to support the 
export performance of the region. The very subdued 
ULC growth is a general feature across Member 

States, with the notable exception of Greece and the 
Netherlands (in both f
orecast years) and Italy (in 
2008). Could wages be more supportive of private 
consumption? 
Real wage behaviour during the current cycle has so 
far been characterised by continuing wage 
moderation, giving little support to household 

disposable income. Three years of wage growth below 
0.5% per year in real terms has given rise to 
distributional concerns. This has led to questions 

about the factors behind the substantial 
decline in the 
wage share experienced in the recent past. It is 
therefore useful to explore the reasons behind such 

developments. In addition to wage moderation there 
are structural explanations for slow wage 
developments. In particular, 
a sectoral re-composition 
seems to be under way, i.e. 
a gradual reallocation of 
value-added towards sectors with
 a structurally lower 
share of labour. More
over, there is also an 
employment composition effect at work, as the 
relative weight of the self-employed in total 

employment has increased. The relative importance of 
these factors varies across countries and time periods, 
depending on changes in the structural features of the 

economy. Overall, changes in the structure of 
employment seem to play an important role in 
explaining recent trends in the wage share.  
At this juncture, it is expected that (i) employment 
growth will remain robust, (ii) the unemployment rate 
will keep declining, (iii) and compensation per 
employee will see a slight improvement over the 

forecast horizon. This should support a rise in the overall wage bill which, in turn
, should feed into an 
improved outlook for private consumption.  
Following the cyclical upswing, labour 
productivity growth remains relatively moderate 
The moderation of GDP growth coupled with still 
strong employment
 growth in 2007 dampened labour 
productivity growth, which is expected to be 1.1% in 
2007, before picking up agai
n (to 1.2 and 1.3%) in

 2008-09. The euro area and the EU both display the 
same pattern, with produc
tivity returning to around 
the longer-term averages in 2008-2009 in both the 

euro area (1¼%) and the EU (1½%). Labour 
productivity should grow faster in the EU, due to the 
effect of catching-up economies and above-average 

labour productivity gains in Denmark and the UK. 
Productivity growth remains relatively low in Italy 
and Spain, while it should rebound in Germany in 

2008 and 2009 as employm
ent growth normalises.  
The structural features of European labour markets 
seem to be prolonging two trends observed already in 
the 1990s. First, as past structural reforms and wage 

moderation have begun to bear fruit, employment and 
labour supply have picked up
. Second, the euro-area 
economy experienced a slowdown in trend 

productivity which began around the mid-1990s and 
came to a halt in the mid-2000s.   
On average during the first half of this decade 
employment expanded at a significantly faster pace 
than during the 
preceding two decad
es. In addition, 
actual data suggests a stro
ng pick-up in labour 
productivity growth since mid-2005. However, a large 
part of this apparent acceleration of productivity 

growth must be attributed to the cyclical upswing 
which the EU economy has enjoyed in this period. 
These results are corroborated by estimates of trend 

growth of total factor productivity which show, as of 
now, little sign of a pick-up 
in this component of 
labour productivity growth
. Thus, while the 
slowdown appears to have ended, trend productivity 
growth remains at fairly low levels (compared to 
historical averages) and a reversal of the trend Œ 

leading to a sustained pic
k-up of productivity growth 
Œ does not seems to have materialised yet. 
PH_711807_CEE5. Inflation hovering around 2% 
 Headline inflation has remained contained so far 
in 2007 due to favoura
ble base effects– 
Headline HICP inflation
 in the EU remained 
contained in the 
first three quarters of this year, averaging 1.8% in the euro area and 2.1% in the EU, 
in both cases lower than
 in 2006. Moreover, last 
August marked the first time 
since 1999 in which the 
euro area registered a period of twelve consecutive 
months with inflation rates below 2%.   
The short-term dynamics of overall inflation 
continued to be driven mostly by developments in the 

energy component. As oil prices rose strongly during 
most of last year, peaking in the summer, favourable 
energy-price base effects contributed significantly to 

the limited increase in overall 
inflation in the first part 
of 2007. The 
annual rate of increase of energy prices 
in the euro area, for instance, averaged merely 0.5% 

in the first eight months of the year, compared to 
double digit rates in the same period last year. 
However, since oil prices also
 fell sharply in the 
autumn of 2006, base effects 
should reverse direction 
and push inflation upward
s in the last months of 2007. 
The strong increase in inflation in the euro area in 
September 2007 (to 2.1%, from 1.7% in August,) is 
already explained by such effects, combined with the 

renewed strong 
increases in oil and commodity prices, 
though the latter are pa
rtly cushioned by the 
appreciation of the euro.

 Developments in 
unprocessed food
 prices, the other 
main non-core component also showed a moderating 

trend so far this year, al
beit much less marked. 
Following an up-tick in the spring, due to unusual 
weather conditions, inflation in unprocessed food 
resumed its easing path over the summer, to stand at 

around 2% in the euro area in September. This was 
about 2½ pps. below the peak in September 2006.  
The decline of inflation in this component occurred 

despite sustained upward 
pressure on prices of 
agricultural and food product
s in world markets.  This 
may reflect a series of attenuating factors such as the 

appreciation of the euro, the relatively small share of 
agricultural goods in euro-area imports and the degree 
of protection from externa
l fluctuations provided by 
the EU™s common agricultural policy to domestic 
agricultural markets. 
–while core inflation continued to drift up, 
reflecting rising food and services price increases 
In contrast, euro-area 
core inflation
 (HICP excluding 
energy and unprocessed food) con
tinued to drift up, to 
stand at 2.0% in September 2007, an increase of 
nearly ½ pp. since last December. While the firming 

up of underlying inflation is in 
line with the economy 
reaching a mature cyclical position, it also reflects 
administrative measures Œ notably the increase in the 
standard rate of German VAT from 16% to 19% in 
January 2007 Œ and strong
 increases in primary 
commodity prices, particularly food prices.  
The upward drift of core inflation can be traced 
mainly to developments in the 
processed food 
and 
services components. The former rose sharply from 
just below 2% in the spring to just above 3% in 
September, on the back of the surge in the prices of 
agricultural commodities and food in world markets.  
This surge is driven by both, retrenching supply due 
to damaged crops because of the adverse weather 
conditions in the win
ter and spring, and increased 
demand due to a world switch 
to bio-fuels and rising 
income in emerging economies. 
At the same time, 
services inflation has continued on 
an upward trend since the spring, rising to 2½% in 

September 2007. This placed services inflation ½ pp. 
above its level of a year earlier. Part of the increase 
can be attributed to developments in Germany, where 
services inflation was affected by the VAT hike.  In 
addition, there is also some 
evidence suggesting that 
firms in the services sector, which are more sheltered 
from foreign competition, are better able to pass on 
rising cost pressures to consumers. Overall, official 

estimates indicate that the German VAT increase will 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  have added about 1 pp. to national inflation, including 
anticipation effects.  This means a 0.3 pp. effect at the 
euro-area level. However, 
there is some uncertainty 
regarding the final price impact. 
On the other hand, inflation in 
non-energy industrial 
goods
 appears to have ended the gentle upward trend 
started in mid-2005.  Inflation in this component has 

been mostly steady or easing slightly since the spring. 
It stood at 1% in Septem
ber 2007, some 0.2 pp. below 
the March peak. The m
oderation of inflation in this 
component is partly explai
ned by aggressive seasonal 
discounting in July in several Member States, 
particularly in clothing and footwear. Another 

explanatory factor is the decline of import price 
inflation for consumer good
s, most likely linked to 
appreciation of the euro. It seems that these effects are 

offsetting the inflationa
ry pressures signalled by 
capacity utilisation rates in manufacturing, which 
have reached historically high levels. 
Looking at developments 
at the production stage, 
there are still some signs of pipeline inflationary 
pressures, despite the continued easing of the headline 
index. Overall industrial producer price inflation (PPI, 
excluding construction) in the euro area fell to 1.7% 
(YoY) in August, compared to 2½% 
in the spring and 
about 6% in Augu
st 2006. This was 
mainly the result 
of ongoing sharp declines in the energy component, 
where the annual rate of price declines observed since 

last April actually accelerated to about -2% in July 
and August. This compares to inflation rates of 
around 15% in the same months last year.

Industrial producer prices, euro area
 The picture is, however, less
 favourable in key non-
energy-related components of 
industrial producer 
prices. In particular, in
flation in intermediate goods, 
the largest component of the index, remains at an 
elevated level, although it eased since the spring, to 
4¼% in August.  Meanwhile, inflation in industrial 

consumer goods, the most
 immediately relevant 
component for consumer prices, increased markedly 
since the spring, to 2¼% 
in August, the highest rate 
since the end of 2001, reflecting the upward pressure 
on producer prices for consumer food items. 
On the side of wages, as mentioned in the previous 
chapter, the overall picture remains one of continued 

moderation in the first part of the year. The annual 
growth rate in compensation 
per employee in the euro 
area rose to 2.3% in the first quarter of 2007, up from 

1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Other labour cost 
indicators, such as the ECB's indicator of negotiated 
wages and Eurostat's hourly 
labour cost index, also 
show only a slight acceleration in the second quarter. 
For the year as a whole, compensation per employee 
is estimated to grow by 2.
6%, only 0.2 pp. above the 
2006 average. This suggests the absence of significant 
second-round effects from 
the past oil price hikes.  
The continued moderation in wage growth is 
remarkable as it takes place against an ongoing 
tightening of the labour 
market, with employment 
continuing to grow at a healthy pace and 

unemployment declining to lev
els not seen for the last 
20 years. However, the estimated deceleration in the 
pace of labour productivity growth for the year as a 

whole (to 1.1%, from 1.4
% last year) implies a 
somewhat stronger acceleration of unit labour cost 
gains, from nearly ½ pp in
 2007, to 1.4% in 2009.  
On the side of inflation expectations, the 
Commission's consumer surveys show short-term 
inflation expectations in the euro area to have moved 
up noticeably, after declining throughout the first half 

of the year.  In September 2007, they were back at the 
level of December 200
6 and, for the second 
consecutive month, above their historical average. 
This upturn likely reflects the wide press coverage of 
the sharp increases in oil prices and in some 

frequently bought food items; such as bread, cereals, 
milk and fruits.  Inflation in these food items was 
running at roughly twice 
their respective historical 
average in September. Reflecting these developments, 
consumers' inflation perceptions have also been on the

expectations in the euro area, derived from French 
government inflation-indexed bonds, also picked-up 

somewhat recently, after decl
ining slightly since the spring, to stand at about 
2.1% in early October.  
However, caution should be exercised in interpreting 
inflation expectations 
derived from financial 
instruments at a time of heightened financial market 
volatility. Inflation set to remain broadly unchanged at about 
2% over 2008-09 
Looking ahead, average annual HICP inflation in the 
euro area is projected to decline from 2.2% last year 
to 2.0% this year, and to 
remain broadly unchanged at 
that level over the forecast horizon. In the EU, 
inflation is expected to remain un
changed at 2.3% this 
year, rise slightly to 2.4% in 2008 and ease to 2.2% in 

2009. Compared to the spring, the new projections 
entail only slight revisions for 2007 (+0.1 pp. for the 
euro area and the EU), reflecting 
mainly data outturns. 
For 2008, there are somewhat higher upward revisions 
in the two regions, which take into account the higher 
oil price assumptions. In terms of 
quarterly profiles
, inflation in the euro 
area is now expected to rise to about 2½% in the 
fourth quarter of this year
, on account of 
unfavourable base effects and higher oil 
prices. It should fall back 
to 2% in the third quarter 
of 2008, and remain at 
around that level for the remainder of the forecast 

horizon. A similar pattern, but with generally slightly 
higher inflation rates, is exp
ected in the EU.  
The inflation projection is 
supported externally by 
reduced inflationary im
pulses from commodity and 
import prices and domesticall
y by relatively sustained 
overall moderation in unit labour cost gains, despite 
the expected tightening of the labour market. The 
annual rate of increase in to
tal primary commodity 
prices (including fuels) is
 assumed to fall sharply 
from about 20% in 2006 to 
10% this year and actually 
register a rate of price decline of almost -3.0% at the 
end of the forecast period.  However, this pattern is 

delayed for the prices of
 food and agricultural 
commodities, which are expected to accelerate 
significantly this year, and ease rather sharply 

thereafter. The annual rate of increase of import 
prices, on the other hand, is projected to ease 
throughout, from 4½% in 
2006 to somewhat below 
1½% in 2007-08 and to
 about 1% in 2009.  
On the domestic side, the profile of nominal unit 
labour costs is explained 
chiefly by the projected 
acceleration in compensation per employee in 2008 

and the subsequent sligh
t easing, while productivity 
gains should increase only 
marginally. Alth
ough the 
acceleration of wage growth is in line with the 

maturing cyclical position of the euro area and the 
tightening labour market, it is also affected by special 
measures in some Member States in 2008, which also 
explain the slight easing in 2009. 
At the Member State level, Germany and France are 
expected to register the 
lowest inflation rates in the 
euro area over 2008-09 (around 1½%), while Greece, 
Spain, and Slovenia should be at the other end of the 
scale (with inflation rates around 3%). Outside the 

euro area, only Sweden and the UK are projected to 
have inflation rates broadly 
on a par with the euro-
area average over the next 2 years, with the remaining 

Member States recording hi
gher inflation rates. The 
Baltic countries, together with Bulgaria, are expected 
to register the highest 
inflation rates in the EU in 2009 
(roughly between 5-6%), alth
ough easing from their 
levels in 2008.

The general government budget deficit in 2007 is 
estimated at 0.8% of GDP in the euro area, down from 
1.5% in 2006, and 1.1% of GDP in the EU as a whole, 

down from 1.6% in 2006. A slight deterioration is 
expected in 2008, as the draf
t budgets for 2008 do not 
envisage any further fiscal
 consolidation. Based on 
the usual no-policy-change 
assumption, the deficit is 
expected to broadly stabilise in 2009. These 
projections confirm the outlook in the 2007 spring 

forecast. For 2007 the deficit forecasts for the euro 
area and the EU have improved somewhat since 
spring, whereas for 2008 
they have increased slightly. 
The somewhat more favourable public finance 
outcome for 2007 in the euro area reflects stronger-
than-expected revenue growth compared to spring 

(from 4.2% to 4.8%), partly offset by higher 
expenditure growth (from 2.8% to 3.1%). Broadly 
similar revisions took place for the EU.   
In the coming years, the 
revenue-to-GDP ratio in the 
euro area should decline gradually from 45.6% in 
2007 to 45.1% in 2009
 (and similarly for the EU, 
from 44.9% to 44.5%) as taxes are projected to grow 
less than nominal GDP, reflecting 
tax cuts in 2008 in 
a number of countries, including Germany, France, 

Sweden and Poland. The 
expenditure ratio is expected 
to decline in step, from 46.5% of GDP in 2007 to 
46.1% in 2009 in the euro
 area, and from 46.1% to 
45.8% for the EU.  
Correcting for cyclical factors, one-offs and other 
temporary measures, the structural deficit is also 
declining this year, although
 less than the nominal 
balance (from 1% of GDP in 2006 to ¾% in the euro 
area and from some 1½% to 1% in the EU). From 

2008, with the output 
gap stabilising at around -¼% 
of potential GDP, a neglig
ible impact of one-off 
measures (in the euro area and in the EU) and no 

further consolidation effo
rt, the structural balance 
closely follows the pattern of
 the nominal balance, 
with a structural deficit of 
around ¾% of GDP in the 
euro area and 1% in the EU over the forecast period. 
Euro area: further improvement in most countries 
At the country level, the 
budgetary outlook compared 
to the spring forecast is more diverse. While the 2007 
outcome in most euro
-area countries is better than 
projected in spring, with 
a further improvement in the 
budgetary position expected thereafter, there is a 
significant worsening in 
a number of countries. In 
Ireland for instance, the surplus 
of 2.9% of GDP in 
2006 is set to turn into
 a deficit of 0.6% of GDP in 
2009 (on a pre-budget 
basis), reflecting inter alia 
lower property-related taxes in
 2007. For France, the 
outlook for 2007 and especi
ally 2008 is revised down 
compared to the spring forecast, with a deficit now 
expected at around 2.6% of GDP throughout the 
forecast period. Compared to spring, the outlook has 

deteriorated also, albeit to 
a lesser extent, in Belgium 
(in the absence of a budget pending the formation of a 
new government after the 10 June elections) and Italy 

(where the forecast confirms a marked deficit 
improvement in 2007 but 
the draft budget implies no 
further consolidation in structural terms in 2008).  
PH_711807_CEEChapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
 Conversely, the outlook improves particularly for 
Germany (a budget close
 to balance throughout the 
forecast period), Finland (still posting the highest 

albeit declining surplus in the euro area, of above 4% 
of GDP), Luxembourg (with a surplus of 1.4% of 
GDP in 2009), Slovenia and Cyprus (both recording a 

deficit of below 1% of GDP by the end of the forecast 
horizon). A significant im
provement is also expected 
for Portugal (where the deficit is now foreseen to fall 

to the 3% of GDP threshold in 2007) and Greece 
(owing to a significant conso
lidation package in the 
budget resulting in a deficit forecast of 1.8% of GDP 

in 2008 and 2009). 
For the Netherlands, the sharp deterioration in 2007 is confirmed to be largely 
remedied in 2008-2009.  
For the remaining eu
ro-area countries, there is little 
change compared to the spring forecast: the ongoing 
budgetary consolidation in Malta and the marked 
reduction of the surplus in Spain over the forecast 

horizon are broadly confirm
ed, while in Austria a 
small deficit remains.  
Outside the euro area three countries still above or 
close to 3% deficit threshold in 2009 
Outside the euro area, of the four Member States 
currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure, 
the budgetary outlook improves substantially 
compared to the spring forecast in the Czech Republic 
(with the deficit now expected to
 fall below the 3% of 
GDP reference value in 2008, after the strong 

deterioration in 2007), Hungary (forecast to reach a 
deficit of 3.8% of GDP in 2009, compared to 6.4% in 
2007) and Slovakia (expected to present a deficit 

below 3% of GDP in 2007 
and reduce it in the two 
subsequent years). In Poland, 
the deficit is estimated 
to fall below 3% of GDP in
 2007 (significantly better 
than expected in spring), 
but to reboun
d above the threshold in 2008 on account of an expansionary 
budget. For several other countries outside the euro 

area the outlook also improves compared to the 
spring, for instance in Bulgaria, Latvia and Sweden. 
By contrast, the deficit in Lithuania is worse than 
projected in spring, and wide
ns in 2008. The deficit is 
projected to widen sign
ificantly in Romania (with a 
deficit above 3% in 2008 and forecast to reach almost 
4% of GDP in 2009), while the surplus in Denmark 
and Estonia declines rapidly ove
r the forecast horizon. 
Also in the UK, the de
ficit outlook has worsened 
compared to the spring with deficits at 3% of GDP in 
the financial years 2007/08 and 2008/09.  
Debt maintains its downward path In the euro area the debt 
ratio continues its decline 
from its 2005 peak. Between 2006 and 2009 it is 

expected to decrease by more than 5 pps, to 63.4% of 
GDP, confirming the trend an
ticipated in the spring 
forecast. Debt developments for the EU27 as a whole 

are broadly similar and debt 
should fall below the 
60% of GDP reference value already in 2007. The 
decreasing trend is shared by all euro-area countries 

except Ireland, albeit to varying degrees, with France 
and Portugal witnessing only a slight debt reduction 
over the period 2006-2009. 
Compared to the spring 
forecast most debt projections have been revised 
downward, except for Ireland and France. Compared 
to 2006, the debt ratio
 is expected to have fallen 
below the 60% of GDP reference value by 2009 in 
Cyprus, Malta and Austria, whereas in Germany it 
will fall to 60.3% of GDP. 
Outside the euro area, debt 
is decreasing in most countries. The exceptions are 
the Czech Republic, Romania and the UK and, from 
2008, Poland, while the debt 
ratio is expected to peak 
in Slovakia in 2007 and 
one year later in Hungary.

 PH_711807_CEE7. Risks to the forecast 
 Amid stiff headwinds building up in recent months, 
the economic outlook for the EU and the euro area has 
worsened compared to the spring forecast. Growth is 

now expected to fall back to 
potential in 2008 and to 
remain at this rate in 2009. Although risk appetite is 
not expected to return to
 pre-crisis levels, with higher 
borrowing costs and tight
er lending conditions as a 
result, the baseline scenario of this forecast is 
predicated on a gradual resolution of the current 

distress in the financial markets.  
Indeed, since the outbreak of the turbulence most 
financial markets have return
ed to a broadly normal 
functioning, with cred
it spreads narrowing, volatility 
reducing and stock mark
ets regaining pre-crisis 
valuations. However, signif
icant dislocations have 
persisted in some important 
segments such as the 
asset-backed commercial paper market and the inter-
bank money market, signalli
ng a continued lack of 
confidence affecting credit and liquidity. Were this 
crisis of confidence to linger for some time, there 
would be a risk of deepening the distress. The effects 
of this are difficult to assess with any reliability as 
markets have evolved in a 
benign environment in 
recent years without being tested under more stressful 

conditions, but credit 
conditions and credit 
availability could arguably experience a significant 
squeeze.  Credit conditions for firms have already deteriorated 
in the wake of the fin
ancial market turbulence 
according to the most recent surveys by the European 
Central Bank and the Bank of 
England. The reduced 
ability to access market funding was cited as one of 
the major reasons for tigh
ter credit standards. The tightening was particularly 
marked for long-term 
loans, which is the category of credit that had 
expanded most vigorously 
in the past few years. As 
long-term credit is being used to a significant degree 

to fund fixed capital expend
iture, there is a risk that a 
credit squeeze may dampen corporate investment by 
more than what is factored 
into the baseline scenario. 
Moreover, although household credit so far seems to 
have been less affected by
 tightening lending 
conditions, demand for hous
ehold credit had already 
decelerated noticeably prior to the turmoil as a 
consequence of cooling housing markets. This could 

mean that both supply and demand for credit could 
shift markedly lower in
 the period ahead, with 
inevitable negative consequences for investment 

expenditure.  
The alternative scenario detailed in Box 2.7.1 
simulates the macroeconomic effects of a delayed 
restoration of confidence in 
financial markets, 
assuming that this will also affect adversely housing 
markets, particularly in the US but also in the EU, 
thereby deepening and p
rolonging the ongoing 
correction in the housing sector. The scenario assumes 
that the lack of co
nfidence in the banking sector will 
manifest itself in substantially
 tighter credit conditions across all risk classes over a prolonged period of time. 
The results show that this 
would entail a significant 
additional loss in output in
 the US and in the EU in 
both 2008 and 2009, due to falling growth in both 
investment and consumption.  
At the current juncture, the likelihood of this scenario 
is considered to be 
relatively limited, since still-
favourable economic fundamentals, such as strong 
balance sheet positions and h
igh profitab
ility, should 
enable companies to ab
sorb tighter credit conditions 
without a major impact on their investment 
expenditure, while robust em
ployment growth should 
sustain consumer spending. In the absence of a sharp 
fall-out on the real sector, 
financial markets should 
gradually repair themselves
 and credit conditions 
could return to more normal levels with time. 
However, the likelihood of the alternative scenario 
would increase appreciably if higher market volatility 

and wider risk premia were to dampen business and 
consumer confidence more strongly in the months to 
come. 
The sharp downturn of the US economy in the 
alternative scenario is also based on the assumption of 
a sustained deterioration in the US labour market. 
However, so far the US labour market has shown few 

signs of weakening, with un
employment remaining 
close to historically lo
w levels and employment 
expanding at solid rates. Com
bined with robust hourly 
earnings growth, the development of labour income 
continues to look health
y, cushioning the negative 
impact of falling house prices on
 consumption. But if 
reduced credit availability affected
 a broader range of 
households, demand for housing and consumer goods 
would be further curtailed, which could eventually 
undermine the solid performance of the labour market 
going forward, feeding back into household demand 

and the economic outlook more generally. A sharper-than-expected downturn in the US would 
have an impact on the outlook for Europe through 
PH_711807_CEEChapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
 diminished trade. While the importance of the direct 
trade channel with the 
US is relatively limited, it is 
the combination with indirect trade effects, i.e. 

reduced trade with
 third countries as a consequence of 
the impact of the US slowdown on these countries' 
economies, that could exacerbate any spillovers from 

an US downturn to output growth in the EU. 
Moreover, a number of other factors such as the 
effects of reduced profitabi
lity of EU companies 
established in the US, balance sheet effects due to a 
fall in asset prices and, particularly, confidence 
spillovers are likely to magnify the trade effect. 

However, in the context of the simulations referred to 
in Box 2.3 confidence effects are taken into account 
via the impact of the financial markets distress rather 

than through bilateral spillovers. 
On the other hand, emerging market economies have 
so far proved remarkab
ly resilient against the 
downturn in the US and th
e financial market distress. 
While this is partly linked to high commodity prices, a 
large part of this decoupling
 is due to the robust 
domestic growth momentum in these countries. 
Moreover, intra-regional trade, especially among the 
countries in South-East Asi
a, has gained significant 
importance relative to
 trade with the industrialised 
countries, making these economies more independent 
of developments outside the region. Since, at the same 

time, the share of EU exports to these countries in 
total extra-EU trade is rising rapidly, the external 
sector could prove more supportive to growth in the 

EU than assumed in the baseline scenario. 
The financial market turmo
il may not only aggravate 
the situation in the US housing market but could also 
influence developments in 
the EU housing sector. As 
shown in Box 2.2.1, the developments of two 
variables related to the hou
sing market, namely real 
house prices and the cont
ribution of housing 
investment to GDP growth, appear to be relatively 
good predictors of turning points in economic activity. 
While such relationships shou
ld not be interpreted in a 
mechanistic way, the exceptionally high level these 
variables have attained in a number of Member States 
seems to signal a heightened risk of an economic 
downturn in these coun
tries in the period ahead. 
House price inflation has indeed started to slow down 

in countries where 
price rises in past years have been 
most pronounced. Moreover, 
in some countries where 
the share of the construction sector in the economy 

has swollen significantly beyond the longer-term 
average, such as in Spain and in Ireland, real activity 
has already started to ad
just. With sub-prime 
mortgage markets not common in the EU, the baseline 

scenario assumes an orderly 
and gradual transition to 
a more sustainable activity le
vel, but a significant 
deterioration in credit co
nditions and credit 
availability could trigger a mo
re abrupt and sharper 
correction than assumed. 
The situation in the hous
ing market suggests that risks 
in conjunction with
 tighter lending conditions are not 
symmetrically distributed among EU Member States. 
This illustrates the more ge
neral point that shifting risk preferences in global markets may affect Member 

States to a different degree.  
In this context, it would 
seem that some Member States are more exposed than 
others, reflecting different 
situations in terms of their 
housing market, the level of their external deficit and 
debt as well as the share of debt at variable interest 
rates. Concern about a disorderly unwinding of global 
financial imbalances has eased in the recent past, as 
the economic slowdown in the US in combination 
with the depreciation of the US dollar has acted to 
reduce the US current-account deficit. However, the 
US deficit remains at high levels and the surpluses of 

many Asian emerging market economies and of oil 
exporting countries keep risin
g, with the surplus 
countries building up 
sizeable foreign-exchange reserves. While a large part of these reserves are 
reinvested in the US thanks to
 the high liquidity and 
sophistication of the US capital market, returns on US 

assets have been typically lower than elsewhere in 
recent years, increasing the risk that investor 
preference will shift away from US assets. Although 

some diversification in the allocation of foreign-
exchange reserves is already in train, up to now this 
process has been gradual and has 
not triggered abrupt 
exchange rate movements.  
Nevertheless, the US dollar recently reached historical 
lows against the euro and other EU currencies, raising 
questions of when the pain threshold for EU exports 
would be reached. While the 
depreciation of the US 
dollar by itself is not consid
ered to represent a 
significant threat to the EU outlook, the fact that 
countries with large current account surpluses, in 
particular China, manage their exchange rates vis-à-

vis the US dollar rather than
 in relation to a trade-
weighted currency basket, is of greater concern. 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  Persistent large current account imbalances would 
also entail the risk of pro
tectionist measures, a risk 
that would significantly rise if 
economic growth in the 
countries concerned were to slow down by more than 
currently expected.  
Risks continue to be associat
ed with developments in 
commodity markets. In particular, oil prices have 

recently ratcheted up again, reaching historical highs, 
on the back of limited spare capacity facing robust 
demand. Moreover, due to 
shortages of refining 
capacity, prices for oil products have risen even faster 
than for crude oil. While 
additional capacity is 
gradually coming on-stream, demand growth 
continues unabated and stocks are at low levels. This 
makes the market relatively ti
ght and sensitive to even 
small supply disruptions, actual or expected, e.g. as a 

result of geopolitical tensions. As a consequence, upside risks to oil prices continue to dominate over 
the downside risks over the forecast horizon.  
The impact on the real economy of the rise in oil 
prices over past years has been 
surprisingly muted so 
far. This can to some extent be ascribed to the fact 
that, thanks to the competitive pressures of 
globalisation, a decline in 
the inflation of other 
imported goods, especially of manufactures, partly 

offset the effect of higher oil prices on domestic 
prices. However, the dampening effect of 
globalisation on import prices 
seems to have ground 
to a halt, with rises in 
commodity prices starting to 
outweigh the decline in the inflation of manufacturing 
prices. Particularly, food prices have recently seen an 

up-tick and, probably due to the important impact this 
product category has on consumer perceptions, have 
added to a rise in inflationary expectations. For this 

reason, and despite the m
oderating effect of the 
appreciation of the euro, upside 
risks to the inflation 
outlook appear to have increased. 
There are also upside risks to the growth outlook such 
as the undiminished growth 
momentum in emerging 
market economies. On the domestic side, an upside 
risk is related to consumer 
expenditure. In particular, 
the expected favourable labour market developments 
may give a further boost to consumer confidence, 

thereby unleashing some of the pent-up demand that 
accumulated during this cycle of unusually restrained 
consumer spending. While, 
in 2008, this could 
probably only be realised 
through a fall in the 
household saving rate Œ the forecast being based on a 
broadly stable saving rate
 Œ in 2009 robust 
employment growth could boost wages by more than 
what is factored into th
e forecast. However, if higher 
wage claims were not matched by equivalent 
productivity gains this could also turn into an 
additional risk to the 
outlook for consumer prices.

Graph 2.7.1: 
Risks to the euro-area outlook
 Taking everything together, risks to the growth 
outlook for the EU and the euro area appear broadly 

balanced in 2007 but tilted to
 the downside in 2008 
and 2009. This is depicted in Graph 2.7.1, which 
provides a quantification of the above-presented risk 

assessment in terms of possi
ble deviations from the 
baseline scenario. The chart shows the impact various 
combinations of risks could have on euro-area GDP 

growth, the outcomes being weighted by the 
probability of their occurren
ce. At a 90% confidence interval, GDP growth in the euro area could be, in the 

extreme case, up to 0.2 pp. lower or higher in 2007, in 
line with the assessment of
 balanced risks. In 2008 
and 2009, risks to the forecast become more 

pronounced and at the same time skewed to the 
downside. Taking again the 90% confidence interval, 
euro-area GDP growth could be up to 0.7 and 0.9 pp. 
lower in 2008 and 2009
 respectively, if mostly 
downside risks materialise. 
In the opposite case, euro-
area GDP could also be somewhat higher, by 0.4 pp. 
in 2008 and 0.6 pp. in 2009.

  Box 2.7.1: 
Possible impact of a global credit squeeze
One of the most important risks highlighted in this 
forecast relates to the turmoil that started in the 
financial markets during the summer. While most 
financial markets have returned to a broadly normal 
functioning, significant disruptions persist in some 
crucial market segments. Although the baseline 
scenario assumes that the turbulence gradually peters 
out, with somewhat tighter financing conditions as a 
result, it cannot be excluded that the lack of confidence 
may last for a longer period of time or that credit 
conditions and credit availability are more seriously 
affected than assumed in the baseline forecast.  
This box will briefly discuss the current credit 
turbulence and the channels through which the euro 
area could be affected, and will give some indications 
of the possible quantitative impact of a global credit 
squeeze on the euro-area economy based on a model 
scenario.  
Both risks and uncertainty spread easily in today's 
complex financial markets 
The ongoing distress in the financial market can be 
traced back to excessive risk-taking in the past, in an 
environment where risk premia were compressed to 
unusually low levels. The turmoil was triggered by a 
rapid increase in defaults in the US sub-prime mortgage 
market, which is a small segment of the overall US 
mortgage market. It quickly turned into a broader 
liquidity crisis as sub-prime loans have been passed on 

to other banks/institutions, which subsequently mixed 
them with other loans or receivables into complex and 
opaque financial products such as collateralised debt 
obligations. The credit risks associated with the US 
sub-prime sector were thereby distributed around the 
global financial system. 
Investor trust was further shaken when some financial 
institutions without any apparent connection to the US 
mortgage market were severely hit, such as the IKB 
Deutsche Industriebank, the Sachsen Landesbank in 
Germany and Northern Rock in the United Kingdom. 
As a result, mistrust among investors spread throughout 
the financial system and market participants became 
reluctant to engage with counterparties, turning the 
turbulence into a general lack of confidence and trust 
among investors.  
While some market segments have shown signs of 
stabilisation lately,crucial segments of the credit 
market such as inter-
bank lending remain seriously 
disrupted. In response, major central banks intervened 
on several occasions. If the current turbulences do not 
peter out gradually (as in the Commission's baseline 
forecast), investors' appetite for risk will be further 
reduced, reinforcing a "de-leveraging", whereby 
investors and institutions reduce their levels of lending 
and debt. With banks tightening their lending 
conditions via higher spreads and increased collateral 
requirements, consumer demand and corporate 
borrowing could also be affected. In addition, the 
current credit losses could rise significantly if the 
turmoil were to affect the real economy substantially 
going forward. One could therefore not exclude a more 
pronounced adjustment involving temporary 
overshooting in the tightening of financing conditions. 
Private consumption and construction investment 
primarily affected by tighter financing conditions 
Tighter financing conditions imply not only higher 
interest rates, but also reduced availability (e.g. changes 
in lending standards) and increased requirements in 
terms of collateral. They would have an adverse impact 
on domestic demand in the euro area, especially for 
private consumption and investment. As the tightening 
of financing conditions is not limited to the euro area, a 
second-round effect may also come from reduced 
demand elsewhere, lowering growth in the export 
markets.  
As regards private consumption, the direct impact will 
be most pronounced for credit-constrained households. 
These households have 
access to the banking system, 
although they can only become indebted up to a certain 
percentage of their income or wealth. Tighter financing 
conditions and higher collateral constraints would 
reduce both theirconsumption and residential 
investments. The impact could subsequently be 
reinforced by wealth effects following a decline in the 
stock of housing combined with a drop in house prices. 
Liquidity-constrained households, on the other hand, 
will continue to consume only as much as disposable 
income allows, since it will become even more difficult 
for them to gain access to the financial markets. A third 
category of households is net savers, which could be 
expected to maintain their low propensity to consume. 
 (Continued on the next page) 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007  Box (continued) 
Turning to the corporate 
sector, the sound balance 
sheets and high capacity utilisation rates suggest that 
the near-term outlook for equipment investment could 
remain relatively dynamic. That assumption would at 

least appear reasonable for those enterprises that could 
finance a sizeable part thereof out of their own 
accounts, while banklending standards have clearly 
been tightened also vis-à-vis corporate borrowers 
according to the ECB's most recent banklending survey.  
Construction investment is likely to be more affected by 
the higher cost of capital, which may also have 
reinforced the ongoing correction of the housing sector 
in some of the Member States.   
The direct impact on private consumption and 
investment may be reinforced by both consumer and 
investor confidence effects. Although survey data have 
started to decline in recent months, most remain well 
above their long-term averages, suggesting firm growth 
ahead. However, with a more pronounced credit 
squeeze, further confidence effects can by no means be 
excluded.  
A further credit squeeze would take its toll on GDP 
growth in the euro area and, even more so, in the US 
Based on a simulation with the Commission's global 
macroeconomic model QUEST, a scenario has been 
simulated to illustrate the impact on the euro area and 
on the US, via the channels discussed above, of a global 
credit squeeze.  
The simulation is based on the assumption that, on top 
of the increased cost of capital included in the base-line 
forecast, there is a further rise
 in the interest-rate spread 
of 50 basis points (bp.) in both the US and the EU in 

2008-2009. Moreover, the possibly reduced availability 
of credit is illustrated by an increase in the collateral 
requirement for households, although somewhat more 
strongly for the US than the euro area (reflecting the 

differences in e.g. sub-prime mortgage loans between 
the US and most European countries.)  
The higher interest rate affects the cost of capital for 
both business and residential investments negatively; 
both could subsequently decline by 1-1½ percentage 
points (pps.) in 2008 in the euro area compared to the 
baseline scenario. A further fall could be expected for 
residential investment in 2009, while an endogenous 
model-based monetary-
policy response, based on the 
standard Taylorrule, partly offsets the increase in 
lending costs for non-residential investments towards 
the end of the forecast horizon.  
The two shocks taken together lead to a reduction in 
private consumption growth of 0.8 pp. in 2008 and 
again in 2009 in the euro area. This follows from the 
limited possibilities of consumption smoothing by 

credit-constrained households. They have to respond to 
the credit restrictions by reducing their residential 
investment and consumption immediately. Moreover, 
the abrupt reductionin demand has a further impact on 
house prices causing additional negative wealth effects.
The results are similar in nature, but more pronounced 
in size, for the US economy. Consumption is set to fall 
by around 2 pps. in both 2008 and 2009, while 
residential investment would be 3 pps. lower after two 
years. A swift response by the monetary authorities 

could support to non-residential investment. The 
negative impact in the US is also counterbalanced by a 
boost to net exports due to a certain endogenous 
depreciation of the US-dollar (by 3% in real effective 
terms). 
Overall, GDP growth would be reduced by around 0.6 
pp. in the euro area in 2008 and a further 0.3 pp. in 
2009. For the US, growth would be lowered by 1 pp. 
and 0.4 pp. respectively. 
The impact of a further tightening of lending conditions 
and reduced credit availability is likely to be 
asymmetrically distributed among Member States. 
Countries with a housing boom in the recent past, with 
high external debt levels or a high share of debt at 
variable interest rates are likely to be more exposed 
than others.

Belgium - Contributions to GDP growth
Forecast
Activity in 2007 
Economic growth remained stron
g in the first half of 
the year, mainly due to buoyant domestic demand, but 
is expected to slow down
 towards year-end. This is 
expected to result in annual GDP growth of 2.7%, 
compared to 2.8% in 2006. 
Private consumption in 2007 benefited from 
increasing real household 
disposable income and 
households' high confidence levels, mainly as a result 
of high employment growth. Private investment also 
grew at a very rapid pace in the first half of the year. 

However, a slowdown in bo
th private consumption 
and investment growth toward
s the end of the year is 
expected. Public investment Œ corrected for the sale of 

real estate by the government in 2006 Œ decreased 
considerably in 20
07, after the brisk growth that was 
recorded last year in the run-up to the local elections. 

Finally, despite the weaken
ing international economic 
environment, exports are projected to recover from 
the unusually low expansion ra
te in 2006 also due to a 
more competitive price setting by exporters. However, 
as imports are likely to 
increase faster than exports Œ 
on the back of high domestic demand Œ the 
contribution of net exports to
 GDP growth is expected 
to turn negative in 2007. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Economic growth in Belgium is forecast to decelerate 
gradually to 2.1% in 2008 and 2.2% in 2009 on the 
back of weakening domestic demand.  
Private consumption is expected to slow down in 
2008, reflecting a considerably smaller increase in 
real disposable income as a result of a pick-up in 
inflation and the slower rise 
in employment. Also the 
transformation of part of th
e health insurance system 
for self employed from a 
voluntary private scheme to 
an obligatory state-run system will affect private 
consumption. Part of this negative impact will 

however be offset by a rise in households' non-labour 
income, partly attributable 
to higher interest rates.   
Deteriorating demand condi
tions, both in Belgium 
and abroad, and less beneficial financing conditions 
are expected to also lead to a slowdown in private 
investment in the forecast years. Government 
investment has been strongly in
fluenced by the sale of 
real estate in recent years. As there are no such 
operations included in the forecast for 2007-2009, it is 
expected to return to its trend growth.  
Finally, export growth is forecast to strengthen 
somewhat further in 2008 and 2009. At the same time, 
import growth is expected 
to flatten, reflecting weaker 
internal demand, so th
at Belgium's external balance should contribute positiv
ely to GDP growth in the 
next two years. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment kept rising rapidl
y in 2007, reflecting the 
continued positive impact on the labour market of 
buoyant economic activity. Employment growth 
should remain sustained with a growth rate of around 

1% in 2008-2009, given that changes in economic 
activity affect the labour market with a certain lag. As 
the total labour force is expected to grow at a 
somewhat slower pace, the unemployment rate will 
decrease. Wage formation decisions in Belgium are 
partly based on developments in Germany, France and 

the Netherlands in order 
to avoid a loss of 
competitiveness; therefore, the 
growth rate of Belgian 
salaries and wages is supposed 
to develop in line with 
the expected wage increases in the neighbouring 
countries.  HICP inflation has remained con
tained in 2007, as the 
energy component has exerted a moderating effect, 

mainly as a result of lower gas prices included in the 
index. In 2008, however, 
higher energy prices are 
expected to drive up inflation to 2.1% on an annual 
average, after which it is e
xpected to fall back to 
1.8%.

  Public finances 
The budget is forecast to show a deficit of 0.3% in 
2007, compared to 
a surplus of 0.4% in 2006. This 
deterioration is largely the result of the projected zero 

net impact of one-offs in 20
07 (positive and negative 
one-offs of some 0.1% of GDP offsetting each other), 
compared to a positive im
pact of 0.8% of GDP in 
2006. The government had targeted in the budget for 
2007 a surplus of 0.3% of GDP and announced 
revenue-raising measures of this type amounting to 

0.5% of GDP. However the government, in its 
caretaker capacity awaiting the installation of a new 
government following the elections of 10 June, may 

not go ahead with the remaining operations, based on 
information available at the time of the forecast. 
 The expected budgetary outturn for 2007 also suffers 
from relatively low corporate tax receipts, partly as a 

result of a reduction of the effective tax rate following 
the introduction, in 2006, of th
e possibility for 
corporations to deduct from
 their taxable corporate 
earnings a notional interest 
expense related to the size 
of their own funds. On the other hand, revenues from 
household income tax, indirect taxes as well as social 

contributions seem to develop rather favourably, on 
the back of strong economic growth. 
The outgoing government is planning to prepare a 
provisional budget for 2008 Œ which cannot include 

new measures Œ in the event that a new government 
may not be appointed in time to permit a finalisation 
of budget discussions by the end of the year. The 

deficit on a no-policy-change basis is projected to 
increase slightly to 0.4% 
of GDP in 2008-2009, 
reflecting mainly the impact of the economic 

slowdown on both government expenditure and 
revenue.
 Having fallen below 90% for th
e first time in 2006, 
the debt ratio is expected 
to continue to decline 
throughout the forecast horizon, reaching 79% in 
2009.  PH_711807_CEE2. Bulgaria Tight labour market fuelling wage pressures  036912151803040506070809

forecast
 %Activity in 2007 
Real GDP growth accelerated to 6.4% in the first half 
of 2007, up from 6.1% in 2006, mainly driven by 
strong domestic demand. Fuelle
d by continued strong 
FDI inflows and a re-acceleration of credit growth, 
investment demand was 
particularly buoyant, 
expanding by close to 30%. High wage increases and 

strong employment growth 
also boosted private 
consumption, which grew by 
close to 7%. In contrast, 
public consumption remained 
almost unchanged in 
real terms compared to 2006. 
Real export growth decelerated to 7.4%, whilst import 
growth remained strong at
 close to 12%. Economic 
growth has thus become in
creasingly unbalanced in 
the first half of 2007. The weak export performance is 
partly explained by lower en
ergy exports following 
the partial closure of Kozloduj nuclear power plant at 

the end of 2006 and the ongoing economic 
restructuring in certain sectors. It may, however, also 
reflect an underreporting of intra-EU trade flows 

following changes in the re
porting methodology after 
accession. In line with a growing trade deficit, the net 
borrowing of the economy widened to around 18% of 
GDP (up from 15% in 2006). Economic activity 
should decelerate slightly in the second half of the 

year, with real GDP expandi
ng by around 6¼% for 
the full year. Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
A certain rebalancing of economic activity is expected 
in 2008 and 2009. Econo
mic growth will, however, 
remain robust reflecting underlying trends and the 
continuing catching-up of the Bulgarian economy. 
Real GDP growth is thus projected to decelerate 
slightly in 2008, on the back of somewhat weaker 
domestic demand, and to return 
to close to potential in 
2009. Investment growth is expected to decelerate to 
more sustainable levels 
as a result of tighter 
international credit cond
itions triggering a certain 
slow-down in FDI inflows. In 
addition, higher wage growth is compressing profit margins, and hence also 
dampening investment demand. Moreover, investment 

activity currently driven by th
e need to adopt EU 
standards in certain industries will gradually fade out 
in the coming years. At the same time, increased 

public investment associated 
with the ab
sorption of 
EU Structural Funds should ensure that investment 
growth still remains well above 10% per year. Private 

consumption growth will slow down moderately as 
nominal wage growth decelerates and high inflation 
together with lower employm
ent growth also limits 
growth in disposable incomes. 
On the external side, lower domestic demand growth 
should be reflected in a further cooling down of 
import growth in 2008 and 
2009. At the same time, 
export growth is expected to recover from the slow 
down in 2007 as high capital accumulation in recent 

years should strengthen the export potential of the 
Bulgarian economy. The negative contribution to 
growth from net export
s should thus decrease 
noticeably. Together with an improvement in the 
terms of trade and increasing EU transfers, this will 
entail a gradual reduction in the net borrowing of the 

economy to around 16% of 
GDP in 2008
 and 2009. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The Bulgarian economy has been showing signs of 
overheating in 2007 with mounting wage pressures, 
rising inflation and a wide
ning of external imbalances. 
Buoyant employment growth and a strong decrease in 
unemployment have led to a 
considerable tightening 
of the labour market, with growing shortages 

especially for high-skilled labour. Consequently, 
nominal wage growth has accelerated sharply since 
the end of 2006 to over 17% in the first half of 2007. 
Given the sustained decline in the working-age 
population and somewhat weaker labour demand due 

to rising wage costs, job crea
tion is projected to slow 
down to around 1% by 2009. Wage pressures will 
remain strong over the forecast period, although 

nominal wage growth may decelerate from the 
currently high levels.

  growth is expected to in
crease to around
 5% in 2009, 
this would still entail sub
stantial increases in nominal 
unit labour costs, reducing com
panies™ profit margins 
and adding to in
flationary pressures. 
HICP inflation decelerated to around 4½% in the first 
half of 2007, mainly because of base year effects due 
to an increase in excise duties at the beginning of 

2006. Since July 2007, howe
ver, inflation has started to accelerate sharply, largely on the back of drought-
related increases in f
ood prices, although core 
inflation has also pi
cked up noticeably, reflecting 
increasing demand-side pressures. In view of 
sustained wage pressures, inflation is expected to 

remain at around 6-7% throughout the forecast 
horizon. Public finances 
Thanks to very strong revenue growth, the general 
government budget surplus is expected to reach 

around 3% of GDP in 200
7, which is clearly above 
initial budget projections. The revenue over-
performance is largely due to stronger economic 
activity, with particularly buoyant domestic demand 
growth generating higher revenue, and to substantially 

higher inflation than orig
inally expected. In addition, 
strong growth of corporate income tax revenue Œ 
despite a 5-pps. reduction in the tax rate at the 
beginning of the year Œ suggests that improved tax 
compliance and a successful reduction of the informal 
economy also play a role. At the same time, nominal 

expenditure growth has remained broadly in line with 
original budget targets, impl
ying a slight drop in the 
expenditure-to-GDP ratio. The general government 

surplus in 2007 also reflects a one-off, expenditure 
increasing foreign debt 
cancellation to Libya of 
around 0.1% of GDP. Based on a no-policy-change assumption, a 
comparable general government
 surplus to 2007 is 
expected in 2008 and 2009. Together with strong 
nominal GDP growth, this would imply a further 

decrease in general government
 gross debt to below 
15% of GDP. PH_711807_CEE3. Czech Republic

Activity in 2007 
The strong expansion of the Czech economy has been 
largely sustained through the first half of 2007. 
Growth has been mainly propelled by strong 

consumer demand, partly compensating for lower-
than-anticipated investment 
spending. External 
demand has remained robust, with exports slightly 

outpacing imports. The strong rise in consumer 
spending has been underpinned by a number of 
factors including climbing wage levels, falling 

unemployment, expand
ing credit, moderate inflation 
and an increase in social benefits. On the supply side, 
the largest contribution has come from manufacturing, 

where growth in output has been spread over most 
sectors, in particular, electronics, transport equipment, 
and the automotive sector. In keeping with the long-

term trend, foreign investment continues to be 
strongly attracted to th
e industrial sector where 
foreign-owned companies dominate export sales. 
 Prospects for 2008 and 2009  
After economic expansion in 2007, growth is 
expected to moderate in 2008 and 2009, toward its 
potential level. Growth is foreseen at about 5¾% in 

2007, while slowing to abo
ut 5% in 2008 and 2009. 
This is foreseen of in part due to the effects of the 
anticipated fiscal contraction in both years, stemming 

from cuts to social expenditure contained in the 
stabilisation package and fu
rther spending restraint in 
the budget for 2008. Private consumption is expected 

to continue rising more slowly, due to the fiscal 
consolidation includ
ing cuts to so
cial benefits. While 
recent investment figures have been below 
expectations, it is still ex
pected that gross fixed 
capital formation will provide a strong impetus 

benefiting from an increased injection of EU funds 
and a buoyant construction market. The trade balance 
is anticipated to continue improving over the forecast 

period, positively influencing the current account 
balance, partly offset by the increase in the ratio of the 
repatriation of dividend
s compared to re-invested 
profits by foreign enterprises. Government 
consumption is expected to be constrained during the 
forecast period, reflecting the aim of fiscal 

consolidation env
isaged in the 
stabilisation package 
and proposed budget for 2008. 
 Labour market, costs and prices 
Unemployment fell sharply at 
the beginning of 2007. 
Hiring has been particularly b
uoyant in foreign-owned 
enterprises. In spite of the recent rises in employment, 
the number of vacancies still remains high, pointing to 
the potential for further jo
b creation, but also to the 
continued presence of structural
 constraints. It is 
anticipated that unemployment will fall, albeit more 

moderately, beneath 5% towards the end of the 
forecast period. Employment incentives incorporated 
in the stabilisation package 
(the reduction to personal 
and corporate income tax and lowering of social 
benefits) will contribute to the decline. Public sector 
employment is expected to remain near current levels. 

Wages, particularly in the private sector, are set to 
continue rising strongly. 
 
The effect of two recent rises in excise duties and 
strong consumer spending is expected to add 

inflationary pressure in the near term. At the 
beginning of 2008, a further rise in excise duty, the 
introduction of environmen
tal taxes and the increase 
in the lower VAT rate from 5 to 9% will add further 
to inflationary pressure. In
 2008, the consumer price 
index is expected to rise towards 4% before easing in 

2009, given that core 
inflation should remain 
moderate. The strong koruna continues to be an 
offsetting factor against rises in import prices.

  Public finances 
The government deficit dropped to below 3% of GDP 
in 2006, falling well with
in the agreed consolidation 
path set out in the 2
004 Excessive Deficit Procedure 
(EDP), albeit helped by st
ronger-than-anticipated 
growth generating higher-t
han-expected revenues. 
 
Despite a revenue boost 
from stronger-than- 
anticipated grow
th, the annual deficit is expected to worsen to about 3½% of
 GDP in 2007.  The 
deterioration reflects a marked fiscal expansion, 
mainly due to substan
tial increases in social 
expenditure without counterbalancing measures in 
other areas. The stated inte
nt of the new government 
has been immediate fiscal consolidation, which has so 

far been primarily reflected in the expenditure 
restraint shown in the stab
ilisation package and the budget for 2008. Based on a successful 

implementation of the measures announced, and the 
likelihood of sustained, albei
t moderating growth, it is 
predicted that the Czech
 Republic will achieve 
substantial consolidation in 2008, with a deficit below 
the 3% of GDP reference value for 2008, and a further 

modest reduction in 2009. Th
e main downside risk to 
this forecast is the ability of the government to 
restrain spending and to continue consolidation in 

2009 against a reduction in direct taxation.  The 
existence of the reserv
e fund, in which government 
departments roll over spending allocations, continues 

to add uncertainty to the forecast. The government 
debt ratio is likely to be constrained to about 30½% of 
GDP by 2009, partially be
nefiting from privatization 
revenue.

%Activity in 2007 
After a lengthy period of 
strong real GDP growth, 
economic activity progressive
ly abated in the first half of the year. Compared with the same period in 2006 

the growth rate more than 
halved from 3¾% to 1½% 
in 2007. Private consump
tion declined, indicating that 
what has been the main driving force of economic 

growth in recent years is losing steam. This is largely 
explained by increasing intere
st rates and a slowdown 
in the housing market, with both lower turnover and 

stagnating prices. However, 
as previously anticipated 
further interest rate hikes did 
not materialise and with 
the prospect of lower taxes, consumption is expected 

to rebound slightly in th
e second half of 2007 to 
ensure annual growth 
of 2%. Meanwhile, non-
residential investment gro
wth, in particular in 
equipment, has also weakened.  
Labour shortages are now clearly constraining 
economic activity, affecting export growth in 
particular. Capacity constraint indicators are reaching 

high levels, and imports are required to meet a larger 
share of domestic demand. As a result, net exports are 
continuing to contribu
te negatively to GDP growth 
also in 2007. The strained labour market appears to 
weaken productivity growth. 
In summary, the economy now appears to be facing a 
period of more moderate growth.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Over the forecast period, GDP growth is expected to 
continue to slow down to just below 1½% in 2008 and 
2009 as interest rates are expected to increase. 
Domestic demand is projected to remain robust, 
driven mainly by priv
ate and government 
consumption, albeit at a lower pace.  
Private consumption will be sustained by increasing 
real disposable income taking over from wealth 
effects, which have weakened with the stagnation of 
the housing market. Residential investment is also 

likely to recede fro
m the current historically high 
level. Thus far the overall trend of house prices does 
not point to a dramatic 
correction, although there are 
indications that prices have fallen in certain regions. 
In anticipation of rising 
interest rates, house owners have over time shifted towards mortgage types that 
are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. 

Nevertheless, further increases 
in interest rates and the 
development of house prices remain downside risks.  
Capacity constraints and labour shortages have varied 
effects on investment. Cap
acity pressure is predicted 
to remain high, thus creating demand for capacity 
extending investm
ents. Concurrently, labour shortages hinder construction activity 
and other labour-intensive 
investments. More generally, the lack of labour 
supply may encourage 
substitution to capital. Export growth is expected 
to continue to be held back 
by labour shortages and 
capacity constraints, resulting 
in increasing production costs. As import growth is 
also estimated to d
ecline owing to weaker private 
consumption, net exports ar
e projected to gradually 
have a more neutral impact on GDP growth.  
Consumer and business confidence depicts a more 
positive picture than might be expected from the weak 

outcome in the first ha
lf of 2007. Industrial trend indicators and consumer expectations have been quite 
stable and remain at relativ
ely high levels. 
Labour market, cost and prices 
The labour market continues
 to remain tight with 
unemployment at a historically low level and 
pervasive labour shortages. Over the forecast period 
this situation is predicted to
 remain, although an 
expected influx of foreign workers could provide 
partial alleviation. In the first half of 2007 the excess demand for labour 
spurred relatively generous private sector wage 
increases, which are likely to 
spill over to public 
sector negotiations to be concluded in 2008.

 Cost pressures are mounting due to the strong labour 
market, in particular for labour-intensive services. 
Driven also by higher food and energy prices, 

inflation is expected to increase 
from a very low level 
to 2½%.  
Public finances 
Public finances continue to
 be strong with a likely 
surplus of 4% of GDP in 200
7, which is expected to 
ease to 3% in 2008 and 2½% in 2009. Income taxes 
will be cut gradually in 2008 and 2009 and, given the 
strained labour market, the expected overall 

expansionary fiscal stance poses a risk of cost 
pressure. 
The strong labour ma
rket position continues to benefit 
both the expenditure and the revenue side. Public 

investment is returning to the trend level after 
extraordinary inve
stments prior to the organisational 
reform at local government le
vel entering into force in 
2007. From 2009, investments are foreseen to 
increase slightly with access being granted to a fund 
dedicated to enhancing the quality of public services. 
Revenue will continue to be volatile due to the 
sensitivity of certain taxes to
 oil and gas prices and 
financial market developm
ents. The special pension 
contribution continues to be suspended in 2008 and is 
assumed to be reintroduced in 2009.  
Following a ruling by the 
European Court of Justice, 
the taxation of pensions is 
being reformed. Although 
the new rules will only apply from 2010, expected 
compensational transfers will have effects within the 

forecast period. Over the forecast period, government debt is expected 
to fall from 30% in 2006 
to around 17½% in 2009.

Sustained growth driven by domestic demand 
The German economy has finally moved to a solid 
growth path. At the end of 2006, economic growth 
was boosted by private 
consumption and buoyant 
housing investment being brought forward ahead of 
the increase in the standard VAT rate. As expected, 
private consumption slowed down substantially in the 

first months of 2007. A similar profile holds for 
export growth, which was overstated in the final 
quarter of 2006 as a consequence of statistical 

distortions. On the other hand, owing to exceptionally 
favourable weather conditions at the beginning of this 
year, the negative echo effect in construction 

investment was delayed by
 one quarter. Substantial 
swings in inventories coun
terbalanced the uneven 
developments of expenditure components, and, as a 

result, headline GDP growth was relatively smooth in 
recent quarters. 
On a solid growth path 
Even if the quarterly year-
on-year growth rates have 
now peaked, reaching in the last quarter of 2006 
nearly 4%, driven by the temporary factors referred to 
above, the fundamentals of the German economy are 

intact with growth expected to be above potential 
during the forecast period.  
However, the phasing-out of the favourable 
depreciation rules for investment in machinery and 

equipment at the end of 
2007 will shape economic 
activity around the turn of the year. It is expected to 
boost investment in the sec
ond half of 2007 and to 
weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2008. 
Nevertheless, both corporate and government 
investment will remain important growth drivers over 
the forecast period. In contrast, residential 
construction is likely to 
suffer further from the VAT 
hike and the abolition of subsidies for owner-occupied 
housing investments.  
Private consumption, which has so far been relatively 
sluggish during the current
 upswing, is expected to 
recover gradually as a conseq
uence of very favourable 
labour market development
s and significant wage 
increases. Consumer confidence is also profiting from 

the rapid fall in unemployment(
1). The household 
savings rate will remain at a high level despite the 
strong increase in consumption.  
By contrast, the appreciation of the euro and slowing 
world demand (partly a result of the financial market 
turmoil) is likely to damp
en export growth. Moreover, 
wage moderation, which had backed the sustained 

improvement in German
y's price competitiveness vis-
à-vis its trading partners and thus its remarkable 
export performance, seems to be coming to an end. 

This will slow down the de
cline in real unit labour 
costs, bringing it more in lin
e with those of Germany's 
main trading partners. Con
sequently, there will likely 
be only minor gains in export market shares. 
Germany's external surplus will 
be further dampened 
by accelerated import growth due to buoyant domestic 
demand. However, with import volumes being 
substantially smaller than th
e export volumes, the 
growth contribution of net external demand is forecast 
to remain positive. 
Some clouds in an overall clear sky 
Against the background of the recent financial market 
PH_711807_CEEChapter 3 Member States, Germany turmoil, both consumer and business confidence 
indicators have recently fallen significantly but 
remain at a relatively high level. While the German 

economy might be hit indirec
tly via slower growth in 
export markets, only a limited 
credit tightening for the 
corporate sector has been 
seen so far. In addition, it 
seems unlikely that there will 
be a decline in house 
prices with corresponding wealth effects on private 
consumption given the post-re
unification recession in 
the German construction sector and house prices 
having remained relatively stable during the last one 
and a half decades. Indeed, th
e financial situation of 
the private sector is re
latively sound. Private 
households benefit from the recent strong increase in 
employment and higher wages. The corporate sector 

has achieved balance sheet restructuring on the back 
of high profits and has even been a small net lender of 
funds in 2006. On 
an aggregate level, 
this puts it in a 
position to finance its investments from own 
resources. Therefore, the impact 
of the financial 
turmoil on the real economy in Germany should be 
limited to a temporary cooli
ng down around the turn 
of the year 2007/08. Inflation to calm down Given the substantial impact of the VAT increase, 
inflation in Germany is currently above the euro-area 
average, in contrast to recent years. While this effect 
should fade out in 2008, consumer surveys reveal that 

recent increases in food prices, particularly dairy 
products, have led to concerns about a higher 
inflationary trend. Nevertheless, while further food 

price increases do seem likely, their impact on the 
overall consumer price index is 
limited. In addition, 
higher oil prices are currently mainly balanced out by 
a stronger euro, which is 
substantially dampening 
import prices. In the light of nominal unit labour cost 
rising only moderately, inflat
ion should calm down in 
the course of 2008 and remain broadly stable at 
around 1½% in 2009. Public finances 
The general government budget is projected to be in 
balance in 2007, for the first ti
me since 2000 when the 
UMTS licence sales yielded exceptional receipts of 
2½% of GDP. The spring 2007 forecast had projected 

a deficit of 0.6% of GDP. 
Consolidation is backed by
 revenue and expenditure 
developments. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is almost 
back up to its level
 of five years ago, while the 
expenditure-to-GDP ratio has fallen
 to its lowest level 
since reunification. 
The increase in the standard VAT rate from 16% to 
19% on 1 January 2007 made a significant 
contribution to this conso
lidation. This was coupled 
with a strong rebound of revenues from direct taxes, 

especially those related to 
profits, which has already 
been visible over the past few years. In line with 
stronger wage and employ
ment growth, revenues 
from payroll taxes also picked up this year, exceeding 
the expectations of the spring 2007 forecast. 
As in previous years, expenditure was kept under 
control in 2007. Despite unexpectedly high revenue 

growth, total general g
overnment expenditure will 
edge up by less than 1%. This modest increase masks, 
however, the fact that expenditure on public 

investment and subsidies has been stepped up in the 
light of buoyant revenues. 
In contrast, the better-than-
expected labour market developments dampen 

expenditure growth. Also, despite the turnaround in 
interest rates, growth in in
terest expenditure on public 
debt will remain subdued. As a result, the structural 
deficit is expected to decline by about one percent of 
GDP in 2007, enabling Germany to almost reach its 

medium-term budgetary objective of a balanced 
budget in structural terms. 
In 2008, the gener
al government balance is expected 
to relapse into a small deficit. The most significant 

budgetary measure, the reform of company taxation, 
is expected to burd
en public finances by more than 
0.3% of GDP. Moreover, 
the strong growth of 
revenues from profit-related 
taxes will likely abate. 
Employees are allowed to deduct their cost of 
commuting from the wage ta
x, pending a decision by 
the Constitutional 
Court. As the budget of the Federal 
Employment Agency was in surplus in 2007, the 
unemployment insurance 
contribution rate will be 
reduced next year (from 4.2% to 3.9%, burdening the 
budget by 0.1% of GDP). As from mid-2008, the 
contribution rate to th
e long-term care system is 
scheduled to increase by 0.
25 pp., which will serve to 
fund additional sp
ending. Public investment is 
projected to continue trending up, due to the 
construction of childcare facilities. 
Finally, the public 
sector wage agreement at the federal and local level 

will expire at the end of 2
007. Since that agreement 
foresaw almost zero nominal wage growth in 2006

  and 2007, public service unions can be expected to 
demand wage increases that at least match those in 
other sectors of the economy. The agreement at the 

Länder level (which has th
e largest share of public 
employment) remains in force until 2008 and foresees 
wage rises of more than 2½% in that year. In sum, the 

budget balance can be expected to weaken somewhat 
in structural terms. 
In 2009, the gener
al government balance is projected 
to move into surplu
s. Following the assumption of 
unchanged policies, social contribution rates are 
projected to remain unchanged and growth in 
expenditure is projected to be moderate. The virtual 

absence of new borrowing at the level of general 
government will dampen the effect of rising interest 
rates on the cost of public
 debt. Two one-off events 
will impact on public fin
ances. A decision by the 
European Court of Justice 
will temporarily burden the 
budget(2). In contrast, budgetary relief is expected 
from a one-time reduction in Germany's contribution 
to the EU budget(
3). The government debt ratio is projected to fall over the 
forecast period, from almost 65% of GDP in 2007 to 
close to the 60%-of-GDP reference value by 2009. 
                                                          
 (1)  The projection takes into account the recent methodological 
change in calculating the unemployment rate according to the 
survey-based Eurostat definition, resulting in an upward revision of the unemployment series between 1 and 2 

percentage points since 2005. The national concept, which is 
based on registered unemployment, has not been altered. 
(2) In March 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that the 
taxation of foreign dividend income in the German tax system 
in force until 2000 was not compatible with EU law. The main 
budgetary burden from retroactive 
tax reimbursements is 
expected to arise in 2009, amounting to over 0.1% of GDP. 
(3) The Council decision on own resources for the EU budget 
2007-2013 foresees a reduction in Germany's contribution to 

the EU budget. As this decision is likely to enter into force by 
2009, the forecast for 2009 takes into account a retroactive one-
off reduction in Germany's contribution by 0.1% of GDP.

Estonia - Output gap and contributions to 
GDP growth
Forecast
Activity in 2007 
After having grown at a rate above 10% for a year and 
a half, the Estonian economy started to decelerate at 
the beginning of 2007 w
ith the rate of economic 
growth reaching 8.8% year-on-
year during the first 
half. Confidence indicators began to fall across all 
categories, admittedly from exceptionally high levels, 
at the beginning of the year, reaching their long-term 
averages by the autumn
. Initially, however, the economic slowdown was mainly on the net exports 

side, while growth in domestic demand still exceeded 
12% and investment growth 
in particular remained 
strong, as many projects that were started at the peak 

of the credit and housing boom were finalised. 
The subsiding real estate boom is expected to play the 
key role in the second half
 of the year and beyond, as 
the clearest loss of momentum is observed in the 

industries that are most di
rectly related to it Œ real 
estate, renting and business activities and construction. This in itself 
mirrors the easing of the 
credit growth that became particularly evident in the 
summer months when the amount of newly issued 
housing loans dropped below 
that of a year ago. The 
number of real estate transactions has also been 
falling since the spring and prices seem to have 

stabilised, although there are no sufficiently representative real estate price indices. 
There was a quite remarkable deceleration of both 
exports and imports in the first half-year. As the 

slowdown in merchandise exports was steeper than in 
imports, this could indicate a more constrained 
competitiveness, but it is also
 likely to be a reflection 
of a decrease in transit-like trade, notably oil, as well 
as changes in sub-contracting business patterns. Trade 
in services, meanwhile, showed strong growth. 

Overall the external balance is
 showing the first subtle 
signs of improvement on 
the back of positive terms-
of-trade gains and a higher services balance. 
In the second half of the year the general economic 
slowdown is expected to
 continue, with overall GDP 
growth for the year as a whole at 7¾% and the 
external deficit still high at around 14% of GDP. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Moderation in private consumption and especially 
investments is expected to sl
ow economic growth to 
more sustainable levels of between 6% and 6½% in 
2008 and 2009. Households' investments in particular 

are expected to moderate, whereas enterprises will 
continue to increase thei
r fixed assets, including 
equipment. Rising governm
ent sector investments 
related to the absorption of 
EU structural funds will 
also support the con
tinuation of investment activity. 
Domestic demand will thus continue to lead economic 
growth, albeit at a slower pa
ce than in 2007. 
Both export and import 
growth rates are expected to 
abate compared with the exceptionally high levels of 

2006, with the contribution of net exports becoming 
broadly neutral. The consid
erable investments that 
were made in recent years will support the continuing 

expansion of export-oriente
d production. Together 
with a significant increase in capital receipts linked to 
EU funding, this will contribute to an overall 

narrowing of the external 
account deficit to below 
10% by the end of the forecast period. Net external 
liabilities relative to GDP, around three-quarters at 

mid-2007, will remain broadl
y stable, though with the 
external debt ratio expected to overtake that of equity 
during the forecast period. 
Net primary income debits 
are expected to stay high due to increasing debt 
interest and FDI-related earnings.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2007 the population of working age started to 
shrink due to a natural 
decrease, with little net impact 
assumed from net migration. Over the forecast period 
this is not yet expected to reduce total numbers 

employed, as the younger generation, which is quite 
numerous, is still entering the labour market; it is also 
expected that some of those who left the country in

 the wave of opening lab
our markets in the EU will 
return. However, limited scope for further increases in 
the labour force will be a 
significant constraint on 
increasing capacity going forward. 
Shortages of skilled labour 
in the context of strong 
growth triggered a leap in wages in the first half of 
2007. Robust wage growth
 is expected to continue 
over the forecast period, driving up labour costs. 
Inflation has worsened in 2007 more than foreseen, 
reflecting domestic demand pressures, developments 
in some world market prices, and administrative price 

increases. This has resulted in an upward revision of 
the HICP inflation forecast for 2007 from the spring 
forecast to 6¼%. The forecast for 2008 is 7¼%, an 

even more significant upward revision, mirroring the 
decision in June 2007 to bring forward to 2008 all 
excise tax increases, previously assumed distributed 

over 2008-2010, that stem from the EU legislation. In 
2009 inflation is expected to
 ease somewhat, but will 
still be at uncomfortably high levels. 
Public finances 
In 2007 tax revenues are expected to again 
considerably exceed those initially planned, resulting 
in a general government surplus around 3% of GDP. 

Tax receipts have been particularly strong as regards 
personal income tax and so
cial contributions, which 
are most directly linked to the buoyant wage increase, 

although indirect tax receipts have also been high. In 
2008 and 2009 the reve
nues relative to GDP are 
expected to stabilise around 37½%, whereas 

expenditure ratio is expe
cted to rise somewhat. 
Nonetheless the overall fiscal position of general 
government is expected to be strong, ensuring a 

continued surplus. 
The level of public deb
t, already the lowest in the EU, 
will continue to decrease over the forecast period, 
while the government's 
financial assets will continue 
to accumulate further; the net assets ratio, already 
significantly positive, will similarly increase.

forecast
Activity in 2007 
Real GDP grew by 6¾% YoY in the first half of 
2007, continuing the strong performance of recent 
years. The manufacturing and services sectors are 

expected to continue their satisfactory rate of growth 
in the second half of the year, but slowing 
construction suggests overall growth of close to 5% 

for 2007. Domestic demand grew strong
ly in the first half of the 
year and will remain relatively buoyant for the 
remainder of the year. Howe
ver, the strength of 
exports implies a more b
alanced growth pattern than 
in recent years.  With continu
ed strong job creation, 
accelerating earnings and the one-off effect of the 

ending of the government-sponsored saving scheme 
(SSIA), private consumption is expected to increase 
by around 6½% for the year as a whole.  
The overall picture for investment is mixed.  While 
housing indicators suggest that this sector has begun 
to decline steeply from its 20
06 peak, strongly rising 
non-residential construction and acquisition of 
machinery and equipment, mean that overall 
investment will see a small increase. Trends in non-

residential construction re
flect planned public 
infrastructure provision
s and buoyant private 
construction; a high rate 
of expansion is anticipated 
for machinery and equipment as a result of aircraft 
purchases and the pick-up in
 industrial output.  
On the external sid
e, the first half of 2007 saw strong 
growth in merchandise export volumes, thanks partly 

to the chemical sector. As in earlier years, business 
and financial services expo
rts also grew strongly. 
Total exports of goods and services are expected to 
increase by 7% annually, and with imports expected 
to grow by 6%, net exports will make their strongest 

contribution to growth since 
2003.  Employment rose 
annually by almost 4% in 
the first half of the year but 
the expected deceleration in growth in the second half 

of the year will be reflected in the labour market, 
giving an overall annual increase in employment of 
3¼%.  Annual HICP inflation is projected at 2.8%, 

faster than the euro area because of higher services 
inflation.  CPI inflation will be around 2 pps. higher, 
reflecting higher mortgage repayments. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009  
Real GDP is projected to grow below potential; by 
around 3½% in 2008 before picking up to 3¾% in 
2009. Given its weight in output and employment, the 
housing sector will act as a drag on growth over the 

forecast period. Growth is expected to become more 
balanced with a significant 
positive contribution from 
net exports.  The scale and 
duration of the slowdown 
will depend crucially on the size of the adjustment in 
residential construction as well as the adaptability of 
the economy to global conditions.  While Irish exports 
will continue to benefit 
from generally favourable EU 
market conditions, the uncertain prospects for the US 

economy Œ the source of much inward investment and 
the destination of almost one 
fifth of exports Œ and the 
rise in the real effective ex
change rate constitute 
additional risks for exports.   
In 2008, private consumption is expected to slow as 
the impact of the government savings scheme wanes; 
in 2009, a small rebound is projected.  Overall 

investment is forecast to decline marginally in 2008, 
negatively affected by a large fall in the housing 
sector. Continued, albeit lower, increases in other 

investment components are unlikely to offset this fall 
until 2009 when an in
crease is expected. Merchandise 
exports are projected to rise further but by less than 

export market growth. Service exports have increased 
their market share in recent years, but this may slow 
reflecting the cumulative impact of faster services 
sector inflation. Imports are projected to slow 
somewhat reflecting slower domestic demand.  
Labour market, costs and prices  
Employment growth will be considerably less 
dynamic than recent years. While services sector 
employment will grow relatively strongly,

  construction employment 
may contract sharply. For 
2008, employment growth is
 projected to slow to 
around 1¼%, before rising 
to 1½% in 2009. The 
economic slowdown is expected to dampen inward 
migration, and labour force growth is forecast to slow 
to an annual average 1.9% over th
e period 2008-2009.  
As this is faster than forecast employment growth, 
unemployment is expected to rise to 5¼% in 2008, 
before rising further to 5½% in 2009. Annual per 

capita compensation is expected
 to grow by around 
4% over the forecast period.  Productivity in terms of 
value added per employ
ed person will rise somewhat 
reflecting the shift away from th
e construction sector; 
in line with the worsening 
picture on output, 
productivity in the rest of th
e economy is expected to 
fall slightly.  HICP inflation is expected to moderate 
to 2.2% and 2% in 200
8 and 2009, as domestic 
demand slows and unit labour cost increases 

decelerate. CPI inflation is also expected to fall to 
within half a percentage point above the HICP by 
2009, as the impact of higher average mortgage 
repayments recedes.  
Public finances      
In 2007, a general govern
ment surplus of 0.9% of 
GDP is expected, compared to a Budget 2007 target 
of 1.2%. Slower economic activity will be reflected in 

lower tax revenue growth and the weakening of the 
fiscal position is largely due to lower property-related 
taxes. On a no-policy-change basis, weakening 

revenue is expected to result in a deficit of 0.2% of 
GDP in 2008 and 
0.6% in 2009.  Current spending is 
expected to slow, but 
capital spending will increase, 
reflecting programmed increases.  
In this overall scenario, a worsening of the external 
environment or a more dramatic correction in the 
housing sector constitutes significant downside risks, 

as tax revenue would slow further.  In 2007, 
government debt is projected to remain broadly at its 
2006 level and to rise somewhat to 28.5% by end 

2009. PH_711807_CEE8. Greece Solid growth driven by domestic demand

Activity in 2007(
1)  Economic growth accelerated to above 4% on an 
annual basis in the first half of the year. Although 
domestic demand is expected to 
remain robust also in 
the second half of the year, increasing by 4¾%, high 
import growth will mean that th
e contribution of the 
external sector to GDP will remain negative. As a 

result, economic activity is estimated to grow around 
4% for the year as whole, slowing down marginally 
compared with the 2006 outcome but well above the 

euro area. The momentum of last year's extraordinary 
dynamism in investment acti
vity started fading out 
already in the 2nd quarter of 
2007, returning closer to 
historical levels, which, along with the private 
consumption rundown, are behind the deceleration of 
domestic demand. On the other hand, public 

consumption rebounded 
strongly, reflecting the 
implementation of relief measures for the victims of 
August fires and the cost of
 the organisation of early 
call for elections in Sep
tember. While exports will 
still grow above 6%, on account of the rebound taking 
place in the tourism sector, imports are projected to 
slow down from the strong increase recorded last 
year. Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Economic growth is expected to decelerate only 
marginally over the forecast horizon, remaining 
almost exclusively driven by domestic demand. GDP 
is projected to grow at around 3¾% over the forecast 

horizon. Rising interest rate expectations and 
increasing uncertainties in the global financial 
markets, coupled with somewhat more moderate wage 
growth, will induce a further slowdown in private 
consumption growth, though it will remain above 3% 
per year until 2009. Government consumption is 

expected to decelerate, closer to GDP growth rate, 
while public investment is
 projected to continue 
growing as fast as this year. Although the decelerating 

investment activity in housing should have a smaller 
positive impact on construction than in 2007, growth 
in equipment is projected
 to continue growing at 
healthy rates. Overall, domestic demand is forecast to 
contribute about 4¼ pps. to
 GDP growth until 2009. 
On the external front, imports are projected to keep 

pace with domestic demand, while the positive 
differential in terms of unit labour cost growth is 
likely to weigh on competitiveness and slightly slow 

down growth in exports of goods. Following the 
rebound of last year, exports of services are expected 
to continue to be dynamic, but more in line with 

historical trends. Although a more moderate growth of 
imports is foreseen, the overall slowdown in exports 
would result in just a marginal decrease of the 
negative contribution of the external sector to GDP 
growth. Consistent with
 these developments, the 
current account balance sh
ould remain around the 
level of 2007, at 
about 10¾% of GDP. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Consistent with sustained gr
owth, employment should 
increase by 1½%, in line with the rate recorded in 

2006, while the slight deceleration of economic 
activity should lead to slig
htly lower growth in job 
creation, just above 1¼%, until 2009. The 

unemployment rate is accordingly expected to 
decrease by around ½ pp
. to below 8%, maintaining the trend of the last few years. As regards prices, 

annual HICP inflation is project
ed at 2¾% in 2007, 
well below nominal wage growth which, given 
productivity growth of 
about 1¼%, is pushing unit 
labour costs clearly above those of the euro area over 
the forecast horizon. Inflation 
is expected to rebound 
marginally in 2008, on the 
back of the oil price 
increases and rising indirect taxes on oil sub-products. 
Wages per head are set to keep rising above 
productivity, albeit slightly more moderately than this 
year. This should somewhat 
slow down the increase in unit labour costs. Even
 so, they would still rise 
more than in the euro area's partner countries, thus 
further worsening the coun
try™s competitive position 
over the forecast horizon, especially in the goods 

sector. PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007 Greece

 Public finances 
The government deficit for 2006 has been revised 
upwards from 2.4% to 2.5% of GDP, reflecting the 
updates in the accounts of extra-budgetary funds and 

of social security. For 200
7, the general government 
deficit is projected at 2.9% of GDP(
2). This includes one-off revenues of ¼% of GDP as well as one-off 

expenditures of half th
is amount. The latter reflects 
the implementation of ad hoc measures addressed at 
compensating the effects of wildfires in August as 

well as the organisation of early elections in 
September. 
The 2008 draft budg
et targets a deficit of 1.7% of the 
unrevised GDP(
3). No deficit-reducing one-offs are 
contemplated. Total revenue
s are budgeted to rise 
around ½% of GDP, mainly 
through higher
 indirect 
tax revenues. Total expenditures would decrease by 

more than ¼% of GDP, mostly due to lower 
government consumption. On account of a slightly 
less favourable growth scenario
 and a more prudent 
assessment of measures on the revenue side, which 
takes account of past outcomes, the Commission 
services project a deficit of 1.8% of GDP in 2008. 

Measured by the cyclically
-adjusted balance net of 
one-offs, the structural bal
ance would improve by 
around ½% of GDP. Based on the customary 

unchanged policy assumption, the 2009 deficit is 
projected at 1¾% of GDP. After reaching more than 
95% of GDP in 2006, the general government debt 

ratio is projected to decrease to below 90% of GDP by 
2009.

Activity in 2007 
Buoyant economic activity con
tinued during the first 
half of 2007, underpinned by dynamic domestic 
demand. GDP growth is projected to remain slightly 

above 3¾% over the whole of the year. However, 
private consumption is expected to lose momentum 
on the back of tighter cred
it conditions. While the 
growth of investment in dwellings might halve with 
respect to the previous year, 
investment in equipment 
is expected to break thr
ough the two-digit barrier. 
Domestic demand should contr
ibute around 4¾ pps. 
to GDP growth this year. Exports would grow by a
bout 4½%, slightly below 
the 5% recorded in 2006 
and overall in line with 
world trade growth. Wh
ereas export activity is 
expanding strongly in non-European markets, 
competitiveness losses and 
the insufficient recovery 
of Spain's traditional European partners might be 
behind sluggish export dev
elopments in this area. 
Imports are projected to increase by 6½%, thus 

following a decelerating path in
 line with a slowing 
down private consumption. As a result, the negative 
contribution of net exports to growth should decline 
from 1¼ pps. recorded in 
2006 to slightly below 1 pp. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
In 2008, GDP growth is foreseen
 to fall to 3% on the 
back of cooling private consumption and contracting 

housing investment. Private
 consumption might grow 
at 2¾%, while investment in dwellings is projected to 
decline by around 1¼%. Yet
, total gross fixed capital 
formation would increase 
by 3%, thanks to 
infrastructure investment and investment in 
equipment. Overall, domestic demand is projected to 
contribute 3½ pps. to GDP growth in 2008.  
The economic fundamen
tals, which supported strong 
and sustained investment 
in housing, seem to be 
fading out: credit conditions might tighten, wealth 
effects seem to be vanishing and, concomitantly, 
expectations are deteriorating. The effects of all these 
factors are already visible in the fall in the number of 
housing start-ups in the first
 half of 2007 and suggest 
that the housing sector may be adjusting towards a 

new equilibrium more c
onsistent with the projected 
creation of new households.  
In addition, private consump
tion seems to be losing 
momentum, also in 
line with its economic 
fundamentals. Specifically, while less robust 
employment creation prospects would imply a 
deceleration of real disposable income, households' 

debt service payments have been increasing in line 
with interest rates. Moreover, the 
recourse to new 
bank loans to finance private consumption could be 

more difficult than in the pa
st due to the current 
uncertainties in financial markets. 
Export growth might remain br
oadly stable in 2008 at 
around 4½%, on the back of prospects for global 
demand, which are broadly comparable to those 
prevailing in 2007, whereas no improvement in 

competitiveness is on the ho
rizon. Import growth, 
although projected to slow down
 in line with private 
consumption, should 
still increase well above GDP, in line with strong investme
nt in equipment. Overall, 
resilient exports together with a moderation of 
imports should push down the negative contribution 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007 Spain 
from net exports to GDP growth, to half of one 
percentage point of GDP.  
GDP growth is projected to further slow down in 
2009 to around 2¼%. Priva
te consump
tion would continue its decelerating path in line with the 
downward pressure put on employment by a shrinking 
housing investment, which might further decline by 

around 10%. As a result, gross fixed capital formation 
growth should increase by a meagre half of one 
percentage point.  
Overall, domestic demand sh
ould contr
ibute around 
2½ pps. to GDP growth, while the contribution of net 
exports would become nearly neutral, as a result of 
lower cyclical imports rather than
 of more buoyant 
exports. Export growth is projected to remain broadly 
stable at around 4½%. This 
would be slightly higher 
than import growth at 4¼%, still on a moderating path 

consistent with domestic deman
d developments.  
Despite this improvement, the trade deficit is forecast 
to still remain at arou
nd 8½% of GDP. Additionally, 
the balance of primary incomes should worsen on the 
basis of cumulated external 
debt vis-à-vis its foreign 
lenders. Higher payments to 
foreign investors should 
bring about a widening of the gap between domestic 
and national disposable 
income. All in all, the current 
account deficit is projected slightly above 9¾% of 

GDP by the end of 
the forecasting period. 
There are risks to this scenario, the balance of which 
would be tilted towards th
e downside. Some of the 
current developments in th
e construction sector, in 
financial markets, house
holds' indebtedness and 
external imbalances could weigh on economic activity 
more than projected in the central scenario above.  
Specifically, the adjustment in the construction sector 
could take place quicker than expected, slowing down 
employment and private consumption more than 
projected. Additionally, in a scenario of tighter credit 

conditions, private consump
tion might further 
decelerate. Moreover, the Spanish households, highly 
indebted and at almost exclusively variable interest 

rates, present a maximum exposure to financial 
turmoil. Furthermore, within
 a context of credit 
restraint, the financ
ing of the external debt of the 
country could take place at higher risk premia, further 
weighing on gross fixed capital formation. Finally, 

population growth might slowdown, on the basis of 
less buoyant expectations about economic 
developments. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
Consistent with the pi
cture for economic activity, 
overall job creation is projected to decelerate over the 

forecast period. In 2007, employment growth should 
still be robust and increase by 3% (full-time 
equivalent). Lower employment dynamism is 

projected in 2008 and 2009
, when jobs are expected to 
be created at rates of about 2% and 1¾% respectively, 
mainly in the services sector.
 The unemployment rate 
might increase by around one percentage point, to 9%, 
in 2009 with labour fo
rce growth outpacing job 
creation.  In 2007, on the back
 of lower oil price inflation 
during the first part of the year, consumer price 
increase is expected to decelerate to an annual rate 
just above 2½% in 2007, one 
percentage point lower 
than last year. In the 
same vein, the inflation differential with the euro area should bottom out at 
around half of one percentage point. However, the 
transitory base effect of oil prices is vanishing, and a 
rebound of inflation to well above 3% is expected by 

the end of the current year. In spite of higher expected 
oil prices in 2008, which should put upward pressure 
on prices, weaker domestic demand would act in the 

opposite direction, so that
 inflation might remain at 
levels close to 3% over the forecasting period. By the 
end of 2009, a decelerating internal demand would 

ease price pressures, leading to a slight decline of 
headline inflation to 
2¾%. The inflation differential 
with the euro area is projected to increase to about ¾ 

of one percentage point over the next two years.  
Compensation of employees is projected to closely 
follow inflation developme
nts between 2007 and 
2009, as in the recent past. Productivity growth for the 

economy as a whole would re
main sluggish over the 
forecast horizon, always below 1% per year. Unit 
labour costs would not 
moderate substantially, from 
marginally above 2% in 2007 
to just below 2% in 
2009.   
Public finances 
In 2007, the general gove
rnment surplus is estimated 
at around 1¾% of GDP. This 
is similar to 2006, but 
well above the target in th
e 2007 Budget Law (0.7% 
of GDP). Higher-than-expected revenues, especially

  direct taxes, largely explain the better result. Indeed, 
corporate taxes associated to unusual profits are 
growing at record levels. 
In 2008, the Draft Budget Law targets a surplus of 
1¼% of GDP compared to the 0.7% assumed in the 
updated 2006 Stability Programme. This target 
appears realistic. Although the Draft Budget Law 

seems to be based on a slightly favourable 
macroeconomic scenario (it projects GDP to grow by 
3.3% next year), favourable projections for tax 

revenue growth might be broadly offset by the base 
effect corresponding to higher-than-expected revenues 
in 2007. Total expenditures would grow by about 7%, 

above nominal GDP growth at 6%. 
Regarding central government expenditure, the 2008 
Draft Budget Law gives priority again to R&D, which 
should grow in nominal ter
ms by around 17%. As a 
result, public R&D will represent 0.7% of GDP. 
Public investment remains
 dynamic, and should grow 
by around 10%, also supported by sizeable below-the-
line operations.  In 2009, based on the customary no-policy-change 
scenario, the general government surplus could 

narrow to just above half of
 one percentage point of 
GDP. Revenues are projected to grow at around 5¼%, 
slightly below nominal GDP, reflecting mainly fewer 

indirect and corporate taxes on the back of declining 
tax collection associated to a scenario of less buoyant 
housing market and corporate profits. Total 

expenditures are assumed to follow previous trends 
and increase by around 6¾%.  
Although the primary surplu
s should decline from 
3½% in 2007 to 2% in
 2009, the debt-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to continue on a decreasing path, from 
36¼% of GDP in 2007 to around 33% in 2009.

GDP Growth (lhs) 
%%The economic situation in 2007  
GDP growth lost momentum in the second quarter of 
2007 and is expect
ed to average 1.9% for the year as a 
whole, virtually the same rat
e as in 2006. It is still 
largely supported by domestic demand, while the 
external sector is likely to again make a negative 
contribution, albeit less so 
than in previous years.  
The disappointing performa
nce in the second quarter, 
with GDP increasing by only 0.3% QoQ, largely 
reflects the unexpected stagnation of business 
investment which could in part
 be attributed to a wait-
and-see attitude linked to 
uncertainties about the 
strategy of a new government. The recent financial 
turmoil is unlikely to encou
rage firms to boost their 
investment plans in the second half of the year. 
Nevertheless, short-ter
m indicators remain 
encouraging, at least as regards domestic demand, and 

a technical rebound in invest
ment spending at the end 
of the year seems plausible since the productive 
capacity utilisation rate is slightly above its average 

level. Consumption in manufactured goods increased 
by around 2% QoQ in Q3 and demand expectations 
still remain healthy in bo
th the industrial and services 
sectors. In particular, privat
e consumption should be 
more dynamic in the second half of the year, with real 

personal disposable income su
pported by income tax 
cuts introduced with the 
budget for 2007, combined 
with muted inflation. The TEPA fiscal package(
1), 
adopted in summer, is not expected
 to have an impact 
on growth in 2007. Purchasing power should also be 
supported by the growth in wage income due to 

accelerating employment and subdued inflation. HICP 
inflation is likely to stay close to
 1.5% in 2007. The 
contribution of the external 
sector is likely to remain 
negative, despite the improvem
ent of the economic 
situation in France's main trading partners, given that 

imports will continue to 
grow more strongly than 
exports.   Prospects for 2008 and 2009  
In 2008 and 2009, real GDP growth is expected to 
remain subdued and slightly 
below current estimates 
of potential growth. It should 
still be largely driven by 
domestic demand, with the external sector once more 
making a negative contribution.  
Private consumption is forecast 
to continue to be the 
main driver of economic 
growth. Consumption will 
increase in line with households' disposable income, 
reflecting both the expected rise in employment and 

tax and social contributions cuts introduced with the 
TEPA package. The new tax deductions on mortgage-
loan interest (also part of the TEPA package) should 

cushion the negative im
pact of high real-estate prices 
and tighter financing conditions and hold up demand 
for housing, and hence domestic demand. Finally, the 
projected benign inflation outlook should also support 
households™ purchasing power. 
Considering the fact that the capacity utilisation rate is 
now slightly above its long-term average and that 
some firms need to upgrade and replace their 
production capacity, invest
ment in equipment is 
expected to remain robust in the next two years at 
around 4¼%. Muted inflation 
combined with the 
recent financial turmoil could lead to higher real 
PH_711807_CEEChapter 3 Member States, France interest rates. The consequen
t tightening of financial 
conditions could hamper the acceleration of 
investment, although dome
stic demand expectations 
should remain healthy.  
In the external sector, exp
ort growth is likely to be 
dampened by the appreciation of the euro and a 
slower global expansion. Moreover, French export 

growth will still be constrain
ed by an unfavourable 
product and geographical sp
ecialisation. In a context 
where imports are forecast to remain buoyant in view 

of robust final demand, the 
contribution of net trade to 
GDP growth will again become more negative in 
2008 and 2009.  
 Labour markets, costs and prices 
In 2007, employment is expected to increase by 1%, 
i.e. slightly more than expected considering the 
modest improvement of the economic situation in the 
first half of 2007. Employment
 growth is expected to 
remain robust in 2008 and to slow down gradually 
towards the end of the forecast period, reflecting the 
traditional lag with which employment reacts to 
economic activity. 
Given the still high 
unemployment rate, wage 
moderation is expected to continue. As productivity 

growth is expected to de
celerate from the high rate 
observed in 2004, unit labo
ur costs should rise by 2% 
in 2008 and in 2009
. Core inflation is thus projected 
to pick up gr
adually, due to price increases in services 
and some pass-through effects of prices of raw 
materials. Nevertheless, given the difficulties for 

companies to fully pass th
e increase in commodity 
prices on to final custom
ers, due to the still strong 
competition from low-cost countries, prices of 

manufactured goods are expected to rise only 
modestly. Inflationary demand pressures should 
remain subdued due to the persistent negative output 

gap. In this context, annual
 HICP inflation should be 
marginally above 1½% in both years. 
 Public finances 
Following a significant declin
e from 2.9% of GDP in 
2005 to 2.5% in 2006, the general government deficit 
is forecast to broadly stabilise in 2007 at 2.6% of 
GDP, compared to the government's objective of 
2.4% of GDP. This difference would result from 
slightly higher expe
nditures, notably in social security (only partially corrected by measures taken in July) 

and somewhat lower revenues. In spite of the small 
projected increase in the headline deficit, 2007 should 
show an improvement in the structural balance (the 

cyclically-adjusted-balance net of one-offs) of around 
0.3% of GDP compared to 2006. One-off measures in 
2007 are expected to amount to around 0.05% of 

GDP, down from 0.3% of GDP in 2006(
2).  On the revenue side, the effects of the robust 
employment performance and strong corporate tax 
proceeds are likely to counterbalance the impact of 

the income tax reduction incl
uded in the 2007 finance 
law, while VAT receipts are lower than expected. 
Taking into account also the cuts in social 

contributions for overtime with an impact of 0.1% of 
GDP which entered into force on 1 October, the 
overall tax burden would decrease to 44.0% of GDP, 

from 44.2% in 2006. On the expenditure side, despite 
the reduction of state expe
nditures (although by less 
than the targeted decrease of 1% in volume), 
substantial slippages have been recorded in social 
security and particularly in healthcare, where once 

again the objective will not
 be achieved. Local 
expenditure growth, though slowing, remains 
dynamic, in line with the electoral cycle. All in all, the 

expenditure-to-GDP ratio would broadly stabilise 
compared to 2006 at 53.2% of GDP. 
In 2008, the deficit is expected
 to remain at 2.6% of 
GDP, compared with an official target of 2.3%. The 

forecast incorporates the measures in the TEPA 
package and those presented in the draft finance laws 
for the state and social security. The main measures, 

which impact chiefly on revenues, are: (a) the fiscal 
package (including, inter 
alia, the virtual elimination 
of the inheritance tax, 
an income tax credit for 
mortgage interests, th
e "tax shield" or 
bouclier fiscal
, i.e. a maximum of 50% of in
come in tax paid, and tax 
rebates on overtime) with an
 overall additional 
negative impact of 0.4% of 
GDP in 2008, (b) an 
additional cut 
in the local "
taxe professionnelle
" (negative impact of 0.1% of GDP), and (c) a reform in 
dividends taxation, with
 a positive one-off effect of 
0.1% of GDP in 2008, sp
lit between the state and 
social security(3). The forecast also assumes that the 
new rule for state expenditures, a "zero volume" 
increase extended to include most transfers from the 

state to the local authorities, is observed. It is backed

Local authorities' expenditures should also decrease 
significantly in view of the March 2008 local

% Activity in 2007 
Following a weak real GDP growth in the first 
semester of 2007, a mo
re dynamic expansion in 
economic activity is expected in the third quarter of 

the year, based on an anticipated re
bound in industrial 
output. On the other hand, for the fourth quarter of the 
year, business confidence indicators point to an easing 

of economic growth. Given the good starting position 
created by the acceleration of GDP growth in the 
fourth quarter of 2006, economic growth in 2007 as a 

whole is expected to be 1.9%, 
in line with the spring 
forecast and above potential. 
Supported by favourable 
employment developments 
and fiscal incentives for the purchase of durable 

goods, private consumption was the main driver of 
GDP growth in the first half of the year. Domestic 
demand will continue to be the main contributor to 

growth throughout the year
, also thanks to expected 
increase in investment. Th
e evolution of exports to 
date deserves a special mention: while in value terms 

exports of goods have recorded a strong increase, 
persistently high estimated price deflators for 
exported goods imp
ly that Italy is continuing to 
accumulate significant losses of market shares in 
volume terms. However, combined with moderate 

import dynamics, in particular of energy goods, net 
exports are expected to provide a slightly positive 
contribution to GDP grow
th in 2007, even though 
services, including th
e tourism sector, have pushed in 
the opposite direction. The forecast for annual HICP 
inflation in 2007 is at 1.9%, down from 2.2% in 2006, 

also thanks to a lower contribution from energy prices 
and some of the liberalisation measures adopted so 
far, namely of telecommunications. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
The growth momentum at 
the start of 2008 will be 
considerably lower than it was in 2007. In the context 
of a still benign, though slightly less dynamic and 

more uncertain international 
environment, economic 
growth in 2008 as a whole is expected to be 1.4%, 0.3 
of a percentage point lower 
than in the 2007 spring 
forecast. For 2009, real GDP growth is forecast to 
converge towards potential, at 1.6%.  Thanks to the expected increase in real disposable 
income, private consumpti
on will continue to be the 
main driver of GDP growth in both years, even 
though it will decelerate in 2008, on the back of an 
expected rise in the saving rate. Investment 

expenditure will decelerate due to less favourable 
financial conditions and less vigorous public 
investment. In particular, in 2008, residential 

construction will undergo a deceleration from the high growth rates recorded in 2005-2007. The currently 
high capacity utilisation will mean that the equipment 
component will continue to increase in 2008, albeit at 
a more moderate pace. In 2009, a slight acceleration is 

forecast. Given still favourable external demand and 
the ongoing restructuring in the manufacturing sector, 
export growth is expected to 
remain broadly stable in 
2008 and to accelerate in 2009, with a higher 
contribution from services. On the other hand, import 
growth is expected to recover to a path consistent with 

historical levels, also driven by 
the exchange rate 
appreciation. The result is 
a slightly negative contribution to economic growt
h from net exports in 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007 Italy 
2008 and 2009. In this 
scenario, Italy will continue 
losing market shares as measured in volume. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2007, employment growth will decelerate after the 
strong increase recorded in 20
06. Still, the decline in 
the unemployment rate will 
be substantial, as labour 
force growth is expected to stall. The projected lower 
economic dynamism in 2008 and 2009 should lead to 

a further reduction in empl
oyment growth. Combined 
with only a small recovery in 
the growth rate of the 
labour force, the unemploy
ment rate is projected to 
continue decreasing in both 2008 and 2009.  
After the significan
t increase in 2007, labour productivity is forecast to decelerate in 2008, and to 
recover somewhat in 2009. In the manufacturing 

sector, productivity growth is set to slow down 
already in 2007, after
 the sustained ga
ins recorded in 
2006. Growth in compensation per employee will be 

moderate in 2007, while it 
is expected to accelerate in 
2008, due to the scheduled contract renewals in both 
the public and the private sectors. As a result, the 
growth pace of unit labour costs will accelerate from 
1.2% in 2007 to 3.1% in 2008.  
Dynamic unit labour cost growth
 together with higher 
oil and food prices will pus
h HICP inflation slightly 
up in 2008, to 2%. A new deceleration is expected in 
the following year, to 1.9%, 
as inflationary pressures 
will be contained. 
Public finances 
In 2007, the general 
government deficit is forecast at 
2.3% of GDP. The improv
ement with respect to the 
4.4% of GDP deficit recorded in 2006 reflects 

buoyant revenue as well as the impact of one-offs, 
which turns from a negative 1.2% of GDP in 2006 
into a positive 0.2% of 
GDP (taxes on the revaluation 
of companies' assets and proceeds from the sale of 
real estate). A sizeable share of this improvement is 
accounted for by the new measures compensating the 

permanent loss in VAT reve
nue linked to the 2006 
European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling against Italy's 
VAT regime for company cars, officially estimated at 
more than 0.3% of GDP. The primary balance is 
forecast to rise to 2.5% of GDP in 2007.  
The revenue to GDP ratio net of one-offs will increase 
by over 1% of GDP. Around one third of this increase 
stems from the transfer of part of the severance pay 
scheme (TFR) flows from enterprises to the national 
social security institution (INPS), 
a measure that 
brings additional revenues in
 the short-term, but does 
not improve public fin
ance sustainability. The 
remainder can be ascribed to the various measures 
adopted in 2006 aimed 
at widening the tax base, as 
well as to exceptionally buoyant corporate income tax 
revenue.    
On the spending side, interest expenditure as a share 
of GDP will increase slightly. Two deficit-increasing 

packages adopted during the year envisaged 
additional expenditure, 
officially estimated at 0.9% of 
GDP. Also as a result of these measures, real current 

primary expenditure is ex
pected to rise by 2.3% 
relative to 2006, well ab
ove potential output growth. 
Public investment is forecast to rise even more, 

although not as much as in the official projections 
given the fall recorded in the first semester. This 
explains the 0.1 pp. lower deficit forecast by the 

Commission services. The expenditure outcome could 
be somewhat lower than fo
recast if delays occur in the 
budgetary execution, in particular 
at local level, in the 
final months of the year.  
The structural deficit (defined as the cyclically-
adjusted deficit net of one-off and temporary 

measures) is expected to be almost ¾% of GDP lower 
than in 2006. Over
 2006-2007, the ov
erall structural 
adjustment will be close to 2% of GDP.  
The government confirmed the target of a deficit at 
2.2% of GDP for 2008, with real GDP growth at 
1.5%. Starting from a 1.8% of GDP baseline deficit 
projection based on unchanged legislation, the draft 

2008 budget law adopted 
on 29 September has a 
deficit-increasing impact of 0.4 pp. The draft budget 
law foresees a reshuffling of expenditure as well as 

additional current 
expenditure and some
 tax cuts. The 
financing of the public 
sector wage agreement for the 
period 2006-2007 absorbs almost three quarters of the 

net additional expenditure. 
In the official projections, 
the wage bill increases by 
around 7% in 2008 (9% 
over the 2007-2008 period). The tax cuts mainly 
relate to rent deductibility and
 housing property taxes 
collected by municipalities. The draft budget law also 

envisages a reduction in the tax rates on corporate 
income (IRES) and of the regional tax on productive 
activity (IRAP). However, a widening of the tax base 

would lead to an ove
rall positive b
udgetary impact.

  The Commission services forecast the 2008 deficit at 
2.3% of GDP. While the estimate of the impact of the 
draft 2008 budget 
law is in line w
ith the official one, 
the baseline projections of 
primary expenditure are 
slightly more cautious, in the 
absence of convincing 
measures aimed at containing expenditure growth and 

taking account that some exp
enditure could shift from 
2007 to 2008. The primary balance is forecast to 
remain broadly unchanged. Interest expenditure as a 

share of GDP is expected to rise by another 0.1%. The 
structural budget balance is estimated to record no 
improvement (substitutive tax
es on the revaluation of 
companies' assets and proceeds from the sale of real 
estate are expected to reduce the deficit by 0.1% of 
GDP).  
There are risks on both the negative and the positive 
sides attached to the deficit forecast for 2008. On the 
one hand, a better carryover from 2007 is possible 
given the positive budgetary 
outturn in the first half of 
the year and favourable developments in the State 
sector cash borrowing requirement up to October. On 
the other hand, budgetary slippages similar to those 
recorded in 2007 could lead to a higher deficit. In 
addition, the outcome of 
the substantial changes in 
corporate taxation is subj
ect to significan
t uncertainty 
on both sides.  
Based on the customary no-policy-change 
assumption, the 2009 deficit is forecast to remain 

unchanged at its 2008 level of 2.3% of GDP.   
Also due to a high nominal GDP growth, the 
government debt is forecast to decrease from 106.8% 
of GDP in 2006 to 104.3% in 
2007. The debt ratio is 
then expected to decline to 102.9% in 2008 and, based 
on an unchanged policy scenario, to decrease slightly 
further in 2009.

% of GDP
Activity in 2007 
Economic activity in Cyprus 
remained strong in the 
first half of 2007, recording a growth rate of 3¾%. 
GDP is projected to have 
grown at comparable rates 
over the second half of 
the year. Economic activity 
has being mainly driven by robust domestic demand. 
In particular, private consumption has benefited from 

historically low interest rates and favourable credit 
conditions, continued employment and wage growth 
and the car-tax reform. Gross fix
ed capital formation 
has remained strong.
 Buoyant private activity in 
construction investment has 
sustained growth in the 
sector at a level close to the strong rate of 2006. 

Overall, domestic demand is projected to have 
accounted for almost the whole of GDP growth, while 
the contribution of net 
exports has been marginal. 
After a disappointing 2006
, exports of goods have 
rebounded and grown by
 about 3%, in line with 
imports, on the back of accelerating exports of 

domestically manufactured goods. In parallel, while 
tourism arrivals declined slightly in the first seven 
months, revenue from touri
sm actually increased in 
real terms in tandem with buoyant activity in export-
oriented business and fina
ncial services. Total exports 
are expected to have risen by about 3¾%. This is just 
below the rate estimated for total imports, which 
should have increased 
in line with strong private 
consumption and investment activity. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
GDP is projected to con
tinue growing firmly at just 
below 4% over the forecast period, still driven by 
domestic demand. Private consumption will continue 
to be robust, supported by rising disposable income, 
reflecting sustained wage and 
employment growth. 
However, compared with the most recent past, it is 

projected to show signs of moderation in an 
environment of rising interest rate expectations and 
international credit tightenin
g. Investment should 
remain strong and continue growing by about 4¾% 
per year until 2009. It will be mainly driven by 
construction, underpinned not 
only by strong demand 
for dwellings by non-reside
nts, but also by large 
infrastructure and other projects. Moreover, as in 
January 2008 Cyprus joins the euro area, confidence 

effects should also sustai
n total investment. 
The projected deceleration in private consumption and 
slight moderation in invest
ment should put a brake on 
import growth, although their still strong growth and a 

rebound in re-ex
ports should keep imports growing at 
high rates until 2009. Exp
orts of goods should 
continue growing moderately, mainly driven by re-

export activity after an accord signed with a major 
global commercial shipping company to use the port 
of Limassol as a regional hub. As a result, net 
borrowing from the rest of the world is projected to 
decline slightly during the forecast period. However, 

the contribution of net ex
ports to GDP growth will 
continue to be neutral overall.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Consistent with sustained
 economic activity, 
employment is projected to keep growing at around 

1½% per year until 2009. Higher participation, 
particularly by foreign workers, should ensure that 
wage pressures remain contained, despite the tight 

labour market conditions. 
However, a moderation in 
immigration inflows, coupled with solid employment 
growth, should keep the unemployment rate 

decreasing. As productivity gr
owth is projected to rise 
by slightly above 2½% by
 2009, unit lab
our costs will continue rising, although at 
lower rates than in the 
recent past. Following the developments in
 the oil and commodity 
markets, HICP inflation accelerated in the first nine 
months of 2007. As a result, HICP is expected to 
average at about 2% for 2007. Base effects from the 
past sharp increase in oil prices would help rein in 

inflation. HICP inflation is 
projected to increase 
slightly to 2.3% in 2008 
before subsiding to just 
above 2% in 2009, in
 line with the projected energy 
prices. This projection does not include the impact of

  VAT adjustments required to

Community 
acquis, estimated at around one 
percentage point, as the au
thorities have not yet 
adopted any legislative measures to harmonise VAT 
rates.  Public finances  
The government deficit for 2006 was recently revised 
downwards from 1.5% to 1.2% of GDP, reflecting the 

upward revision of receivable relating to indirect 
taxes (VAT). For 2007, the government deficit is 
projected at 1.0% of GDP. No one-offs are included. 
The 2008 draft 
budget targets a def
icit of ½% of GDP. 
No one-off measures are contemplated. The planned 
adjustment for 2008 is mostly accounted by a 
reduction of total expend
itures, which are expected to 
be lower in 2008 than in 2007 by ½ pp. of GDP. 
Interest payments, subsidies and capital expenditures 
are equally reduced by ¼% of GDP each. These 

savings are partially offset by an increase in social 
transfers of about ¼% 
of GDP. Total revenues are 
expected to grow broadly in line with nominal GDP. 
Higher revenues from direct
 and indirect taxes are 
expected to be offset by a reduction in non-tax 

revenues. On account of a slightly less favourable 
growth scenario and a more 
prudent assessment of 
measures on the revenue side, the Commission 

services project a deficit of about ¾% of GDP in 
2008. Measured by the cyclically-adjusted balance net 
of one-offs, the structural 
adjustment would improve 
by about ¼% of GDP. Based on the customary no-
policy-change assumption,
 the 2009 deficit is 
projected to inch down at just above ½% of GDP.  
Debt is projected to keep on a decreasing path 
attaining about 49½% of GDP by 2009 (it was 65.2% 
in 2006). Debt reduction will benefit from the 
decumulation of deposits in 
sinking funds held at the 
Central Bank, amounting to ab
out 4% of GDP in 2008 
and 1% in 2009.  PH_711807_CEE13. Latvia Consequences of overheating will linger  -5051015209900010203040506070809

Activity in 2007 
After growth of 11.9% in 
2006, GDP data for the first 
two quarters of 2007 give very little sign of a 
slowdown, with 11.2% annu
al growth in the first 
quarter and 11.0% in the second. From the 
expenditure side, growth 
was still driven by private 
consumption and investment, as in previous quarters, 

and in spite of a significant pick-up in exports the 
growth of imports continued to
 exceed that of exports.  
The second half is expected to show significantly 
slower growth, with whole-year GDP up around 

10½%. There are strong indications that a slowdown 
of domestic consumption and a correction to the 
overheated real estate sector 
have already begun. The 
government's anti-inflation 
plan has helped to end the 
price boom in the residential real estate market and in 
slowing down mortgage lending. The annual growth 

of monthly retail sales and th
e registration of new cars 
also suggest that a slowdown of the economy has 
been ongoing in recent months. 
From the production side, growth is still strongest in 
those sectors which are satisfying domestic demand. 
The largest segment, real estate, renting and business 

activities, has continued its ro
bust growth, but by the 
second quarter the year-on-year growth rate of its 
gross value-added fell below 10%, representing a 

marked slowdown from 18
% in 2006. The second 
largest segment of the economy, wholesale and retail 
trade has also been very dynamic with a growth rate 

of around 15% in
 the first half. In a sharp contrast to 
these segments, manufacturing has stagnated, largely 
due to the poor performance of its main component, 
wood processing. Producers 
of tradable goods are 
facing difficulties due to tight labour market 
conditions, which have led to
 rapidly increasing unit 
labour costs and constraints
 on output. Accordingly, 
recent strong export growth in value terms has come 
mainly from a large increase 
in prices and not 
volumes
1, as companies forgo gaining market shares 
in order to sustain th
eir profitability. The external 
deficit relative to GDP is exp
ected to reach its peak 
during the forecast period, at well over 20%.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
A moderate slowdown is projected, to growth rates of 
6-7% in 2008 and 2009, although with a high degree 
of uncertainty on whether a 
sharper adjustment is in 
prospect. Continuing rapid real wage growth will 
provide stimulus for households, but negative wealth 
effects from falls in nominal house prices, increasing 

debt service payments and less optimistic expectations 
will limit private consumption growth. Investment in 
residential buildings is expe
cted to slow, helping to 
ease the overheating situation 
in the construction 
sector and in the whole economy. However, public 
investment projects will continue and even increase, 
which will provide a cush
ion against a too-sharp 
adjustment. On the external side, the product 

composition of Latvian exports does not favour a very 
rapid expansion of output, 
but exports are expected to 
be boosted by the wood industry redirecting sales 

from domestic to export markets. Overall, GDP 
growth is expected to remain driven by domestic 
demand, but the negative contribution of net exports 

is expected to decrease 
substantially. Given the 
current size of external imbalances and increasing 
property income payments to 
the rest of the world, the 
external deficit is set to rema
in very high, although on 
a downward trend, and with
 external indebtedness 
relative to GDP continuin
g to increase significantly. Labour market, costs and prices 
Domestic overheating, 
unfavourable international 
price developments (increasing food and energy 
prices) and regulated price increases have resulted in 
annual HICP inflation and core inflation reaching 
double-digit levels (11.5% and 11
.1% respectively in September 2007). Inflation is poised
 to remain high in 
                                                          
 (1) However, trade statistics may underestimate ongoing quality 
improvements in product structur
e, leading to an overstatement 
of price growth and underestimation of volume growth.

 2007 and early 2008 as a consequence of food, 
heating and other regulated price increases and 
accession-related excise harmonization. Inflation is 

expected to decline below 
double-digit levels only from mid-2008 onwards, but the moderation will be 
slow, as the consequence of
 heightened inflationary 
expectations, high wage growth and a sharp increase 
in the price of imported ga
s are likely to be felt even 
in the second half of the year.          
The rate of unemployment is projected to stay below 
6% during the forecast period. However, it is expected 
that the structure of em
ployment will change, with the construction and retail 
sectors losing employees in 
favour of other sectors. Very rapid wage growth in 
2007 is expected to slow 
due to the unwinding of 
overheating in the construction sector and as a 

consequence of the government's expected signals in 
setting public sector wages.   
Public finances 
The fiscal outturn for 2006 is reported to be a deficit 
of ½% of GDP. For 2007, a surplus of about 1% of 
GDP is projected, as the 
September supplementary 
budget aims to save the larger part of revenue over-
performance projected for this year. Looking ahead, 
revenue growth is expected to decrease significantly 

in 2008 and 2009, in
 line with the slowdown of 
domestic demand and wages. Additionally, the 
general government sector will lose some social 

contribution payments as the pension reform proceeds 
into its next stages in 20
08 and 2009. On the 
expenditure side, public investment relative to GDP is 

expected to increase, though taking the two years 
together the total expend
iture ratio will remain fairly 
stable, with expenditure gr
owth slightly outpacing 
revenue growth. In consequence, a surplus of around 
¾% of GDP in 2008 and ½% 
of GDP in 2009 seems 
plausible. The debt ratio, already one of the lowest in 

the EU, should decrease somewhat further.

Lithuania - Contribution to GDP growth 
and inflation
Forecast
Activity in 2007 
The expected slowdown has not yet clearly set in, and 
data for the first half of 
2007 suggest th
at economic 
growth may accelerate further to around 8½%, 

thereby increasing risks of
 overheating. Domestic 
demand remains the main driver of growth.  
Investment was robust in the 
first half of the year and 
is expected to lead growth in the year as a whole. A 

large part of investment is directed into the currently 
booming construction and real estate sectors. 
Consumer spending is also forecast to remain strong, 
as suggested by high growth of credit and retail sales. 
Household disposable income has been buoyed by the 
6 pp. cut in the personal 
income tax rate in
 July 2006, 
cash payments in March 2007 as compensation for 
earlier savings losses during 
the shift from the 
Russian rouble to the new national currency, high 

wage growth and rising employment. The rapid 
deterioration of the trade balan
ce seen in the first 
eight months of the year (affected by capacity 

restrictions in oil refining) looks set to be confirmed 
as the trend for the whole year. The external deficit is 
expected to widen to 12½% of GDP compared to 
slightly below 9% in 200
6. However, the temporary 
negative effect of capacity di
sruptions in the oil 
refining industry on both
 exports and output is set to 
reverse by the end of 2007. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Real GDP growth is 
projected to gradually weaken 
but should remain above 7% in 2008 and 6% in 2009, 

with domestic demand con
tinuing to be the engine of 
growth. 
Investment is expected to 
continue to lead growth in 
2008-2009. Some deceleration of credit driven by less 
positive expectations and higher interest rates could 

lead to a cooling of the housing market, but 
opportunities for con
struction should occur in infrastructure projects and in non-residential business 

investment. However, supply-side constraints have 
emerged as a consequence of the tight labour market.  
Private consumption growth is forecast to remain 
high, buoyed by high wage growth and a further 3 pp. 

cut in personal income tax
 in January 2008, public 
sector wage increases and higher social transfers. 
However, consumption growth will be lower than in 

previous years because of the upturn in interest rates 
and an expected moderation in credit growth. 
Export growth is expected to pick up
 in 2008, as the 
oil-refining industry will be
 back at full capacity, and 
remain robust in 2009. Import growth is forecast to 
slow somewhat in line with
 domestic demand. Export 
developments are expected to remain favourable, 
although much will depe
nd on the ability of 
companies to remain co
mpetitive despite increasing 
price pressures. The external deficit is expected to 
stay at a high level, due 
to a higher merchandise trade 
deficit and a worsening of the 
income balance, while 
the positive impact of 
increasing current and capital transfers from the EU and 
expatriate remittances will 
exert a moderating influence. Consequently, net 

external liabilities relative to GDP are expected to 
continue to increase significantly during the forecast 
period. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment growth picked up in the first half of 
2007, while the unemploymen
t rate declined further to 
just above 4% and earnings accelerated rapidly. 
Several sectors are experiencing increasing labour 

shortages, reinforced by emigration, which has put 
upward pressures on
 labour costs.  
Employment growth is expected to peak in 2007, due 
to increased participation rates, before moderating in 
2008-2009. Nominal wage growth is expected to 
remain high and far exceed 
productivity growth. 
Unemployment is expected to be stable at a rate of 
some 4%. Against this background, unit labour costs 
will increase at a relatively fast rate and

 competitiveness will de
teriorate, especially in labour 
intensive sectors. Both headline and core inflation in 2007 have been 
increasing, fuelled by overheating, higher energy 

tariffs and accession-relat
ed excise harmonisation. 
Food price increases have also strongly fuelled 
inflation. Inflation for 2007
 as a whole is projected to 
average around 5½%, up from below 4% in 2006.  
In 2008, inflation is expected to edge up further to 
6½%, prompted by a new round of increases in excise 
duties (for tobacco and fuel) and higher electricity 

prices. In 2009, inflation is 
expected to ease slightly 
but to stay at a high level. 
Short-term risks are on the 
upside, notably through possible higher food prices, 

wage increases and higher inflation expectations. A 
possible further gas price incr
ease at the beginning of 
2008 (by 30-50%) by Lithuania's sole gas supplier, 

possibly reaching West European price levels - not 
assumed in the forecast - also poses a substantial risk.  
Public finances 
In 2007, the general gove
rnment deficit is likely to widen to around 0.9% of GDP (2006, 0.6%), in line 
with the government target. Weaker than planned 

collection of personal and corporate income tax (in 
the first nine months) was partly offset by higher 
VAT and excise tax revenues. The deficit is forecast 

to widen further in 2008, 
mainly due to continuing tax 
and pension reforms (incl
uding a cut in personal 
income tax from 27% to 24% and the abolition of a 

temporary social tax (3% of corporate profits)), but 
also higher spending for social transfers and rise in 
public sector salaries, only 
partly offset by higher 
receipts of VAT and property taxes and, as a 
consequence of accession-related harmonisation, 
higher excise taxes. In 2009 some narrowing in the 

deficit is expected, with the increase in receipts 
outpacing that of expenditure. The general 
government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease 

and remain broadly
 stable at around 17%. PH_711807_CEE15. Luxembourg Slowdown expected in 2008 but growth still well above EU average  Graph 3.15.1:

contribution of financial services to GDP growth
Activity in 2007 
Since the end of the 2001-2003 slowdown, 
Luxembourg is experiencing a new period of growth 
well above the EU average: from a dip of 2.1% in 

2003, real GDP growth progressively accelerated to 
6.1% in 2006. However, recently released data 
indicate that the peak of the cycle was reached at the 

end of 2005 or early 2006 and that growth probably 
decelerated to about 5% in 2007.  
Growth in 2006 was essentially driven by foreign 
trade, whose contribution 
reached 5½ pps. of GDP, 
while private consumption 
and investment remained 
subdued. In 2007, domestic demand accelerated: 
private consumption was hardly more dynamic than in 

2006 but investment, which had grown by less than 
2½% a year on average from 2003 to 2006 was much 
stronger, probably rising 
by about 10%. External 
trade, on the other hand, 
though less buoyan
t than in 
2006, remained fairly vigo
rous, with exports of goods 
still growing by about 6% 
and exports of services by 
around 8%.  Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
While remaining significantly stronger than in most 
other EU countries, GDP growth should continue to 

slow down to about 4½% 
in 2008 and
 2009. Private 
consumption will be support
ed by the fiscal measures 
announced in the budget but, with the rising share of 

non residents in the labour force, a large part of the 
resulting increase in disposab
le income will be spent 
abroad. Investment will probably slow down 

somewhat after the strong
 growth rate recorded in 
2007 (due chiefly to the small size of the country, 
investment is very volatile in Luxembourg). Foreign 
trade should remain dynamic as exports markets are 
projected to keep growing at about 6% a year. While 

there is no hint so far that the recent turmoil on 
financial markets has had 
a significant impact on 
growth in Luxembourg, it has considerably increased 

the uncertainty surrounding the forecast since 
financial services represented 
almost 30% of the total 
value added of the economy and accounted for nearly 

two thirds of its real growth in 2006.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment has been buoyan
t since the beginning of 
the current strong grow
th episode, increasing by 
nearly 3% a year on average from 2003 to 2006 and 

probably by about 4% 
in 2007. However, quite 
paradoxically, unemployment,
 though remaining low 
by international standards, mo
re than doubled in 
recent years : the unemployment rate started rising 
from a minimum of 2.3% in 2001, as a result of the 
slowdown in output and 
employment, then continued 
to increase despite the ensuing recovery, reached 
4.5% in 2006 and ba
rely stabilised in
 2007. The 
strong employment growth
 in recent years mostly 
benefited non-residents, who
 accounted for three 
quarters of the jobs created from 2003 to 2006 and 

now represent more than on
e third of total labour 
force. However, with the acceleration in job creation 
in 2006-2007, resident employment, too, speeded up, 

from an annual rise of about
 1% in 2003-2005 to 
1.7% in 2006 and probably
 2% in 2007. With still 
strong projected employment growth over the forecast 

period, unemployment shoul
d eventually begin to 
edge down slowly in 2008 
and 2009. How
ever, as it is now essentially structural in nature, the scope for a 
reduction is probably quite limited 
in the short run.   
Inflation in recent years has for a large part followed 
developments in oil prices. Fluctuations were 
significantly more marked for 
the HICP th
an for the 
national CPI, which excludes consumption of non-
residents and especially their large purchases of car 
fuel. From the spring of 2004 to the autumn of 2006, 
the annual rise in the 
HICP had hovered between 3% 
and 4% but the increase in 
the national CPI generally 
remained between 2% and 3%
. In the autumn of 2006, 
the rise in consumer prices declined to around 1½% to 
2% following a fall in oil 
price by about 20% in 4 
months. In 2007, the HICP rose by 2.4% on average 
as against 3.0% in 2006
, while the national CPI

 increased by 2.2% after 2.7%. In 2008, inflation is 
projected to accelerate following the recent hike in oil 
prices: the rise in the HICP 
(about 2¾%) should be 
more pronounced than that
 in the national CPI 
(around 2½%). In 2009, with the projected decrease in 
oil prices, both indexes should decelerate. 
Despite the partial de-indexation of wages and social 
benefits decided in 2006 in order to cope with the 
deterioration in public finances and in 
competitiveness (the existing indexation system was 

replaced up to 2009 by an indexation at predetermined 
dates), the rise in wages seems to have been 
substantial in 2006 and 2007, reaching about 4½% in 

both years. With still strong projected output and 
employment growth over the forecast horizon, wages 
should remain rather buoyan
t in 2008 and 2009.     
Public finances 
It now appears that the det
erioration in government 
finances since the record surpluses of the early 2000s, 
though unquestionably 
substantial, was more limited 
than previously believed: 
while initial estimates 
indicated that the deficit had reached 2.3% of GDP in 
2005, revised data show that it actually peaked at 
1.2% in 2004 and almost
 totally disappeared already 
in 2005, falling to 0.1%. In
 2006, government finance 
recorded a 0.7% of GDP surplus, which probably 

widened to about 1¼% in 2007. 
The 2008 budget foresees an ad
aptation of income tax 
brackets to consumer prices inflation (they had not 
been indexed since 2002) as well as an increased tax 

reduction for children (brou
ght to 922.50 euros per 
child and per year). Moreover, the recent wage 
agreement in the government sector provides for a 

bonus amounting to 0.9% of yearly wages to be paid 
in 2007 and 2008 as well as an additional 1.5% 
increase in 2009. These measures should lead to a 

reduction in the government
 surplus 
from 1¼% of GDP in 2007 to about 1% in 2008. Under an 
"unchanged policy" assumpti
on and thanks to still 
buoyant output and employme
nt growth, the surplus 
should resume rising to about
 1½% of GDP in 2009.

Hungary - net lending  positions         
                        and GDP growth
Activity in 2007 
In 2007, economic 
growth has slowed down 
considerably, reflecting to 
a large extent the 
consolidating efforts of the 
government which started 
in mid-2006. Although GDP growth was surprisingly 
weak in the second quarter this year (0.1 % quarter-
on-quarter) it is expected to pace up and reach 2% in 

2007. Economic performance is characterised by a 
pronounced divergence in
 its main components, with 
a marked contraction in domestic demand 

counterbalanced by a strong export performance. In 
particular, private consumption further decreased and 
is expected to slightly recede throughout the year, 

while government consump
tion has been substantially 
reduced having a sizeable 
negative contribution for 
the entire year. Total economy gross fixed capital 

formation remains mod
erate, which leaves net exports 
as the foremost important 
contributor to growth. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
The economy is expected to gradually recover in both 
2008 and 2009, as a re
sult of improving domestic 
demand and a supportive 
external environment. 
Throughout the forecast horizon, the private sector is 

anticipated to increase its 
contribution to growth, in 
parallel with continued public sector retrenchment. In 
reaction to the substantial de
crease in real disposable 
income, households reduced 
their consumption only 
moderately while further increasing their 
indebtedness. Given this
 smoothing behaviour, 
consumption expenditure and household investments 
are likely to be sluggish in regaining pace; 
nevertheless, their contribu
tion to GDP growth could 
amount to over 0.5% by 2009. 
The rebound in GDP growth is expected to be 
supported by still favourab
le conditions in Hungary's 
main trading partners, providing exports and 

investment with perceptible 
momentum. Private and 
public investment may further benefit from the 
increasing inflow of EU structural funds (around 2.5% 

of GDP). However, rising final demand is 
accompanied by accelerating imports, gradually 
shifting the main driver of 
growth from net exports to 
domestic demand. Along with an improving trade 
balance, the current account deficit is expected to 
reach 2.7% in 2009 from 4.4% in 2007.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2007, private sector wages rose by more than 10%, 
though part of the increase may be due to the 
government™s efforts to legalise side payments to 
workers. Public sector empl
oyment has dropped by 
more than 4%. Based on gradual recovery of the 
economy, a slight increase in employment is 
projected, leading to a sustained unemployment rate 
in the order of 7% and gradually declining wage 
inflation. Public sector wage freezes are expected to 

remain largely effective in
 2008; howev
er a rebound 
is foreseen in 2009
, leading to 3% growth in public 
sector real wages. Inflation is driven by in
creased imported inflation and 
by the substantial hike
 in food and agricultural prices 
worldwide. These price developments mainly affect 
the HICP at the end of 2007, with a carryover effect 

and a pass-through to processed food prices in 2008. 
This prevents a faster decline of inflation leading to 
4.9% in 2008, after 7.7% in 
2007. Due mainly to base 
effects, inflation in 2009 is expected to drop to 2.8%. 
Public finances 
After the very high budgetary outturn recorded in 
2006 (a deficit of 9.2% of GDP), the deficit is 
expected to considerably decrease to 6.4% of GDP in 

2007 (in line with the new official forecast for 2007) 
as a result of the fiscal adjustment measures. This 
compares to the target of 
6.8% of GDP set in the 
December 2006 convergence programme update. The 
better outcome is due to higher-than-expected 

revenues by 0.9% of GDP compared to the budgeted 
figures and a lower debt service by 0.3% of GDP. The 
improvement could have been 
considerably larger,

 had pension expenditure not exceeded the planned 
figure by ¼% of GDP (due 
to higher inflation than 
initially projected) and had the 
government not taken 
additional discretionary spend
ing measures of ½% of

 (against the 4.1% of 
GDP target set in 
the draft budget) 
and, based on the 
usual no-policy-change

measures addressing tax evasion. It also incorporates

the broadening of the tax base for social security 
contributions as a result of the enforcement of the 
insurance principle in healthcare services. On the 

expenditure side, it is 
assumed that the planned

consumption will only partly be achieved, since it 
may be difficult to fully enforce the envisaged 
controls in operational 
expenditures, in preventive 
care and in the public wage bill, particularly in 2009. 

The budgetary impact of the February 2007 public 
wage agreement is reflected in higher pension 
expenditure for both 
2007 and 2008

After the strong increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio 
from 61.6% in 2005 to
 65.5% in 2006, a more 
moderate increase to 66.1% and 66.3% is expected in 
2007 and 2008 re
spectively, chiefly as 
a result of the 
declining budget deficit. The debt ratio is projected to 
fall somewhat to arou
nd 66% in 2009.

 Malta - General government finances
Activity in 2007 
Economic growth accelerated in the first half of 2007 
underpinned by higher domestic demand, in particular 
private consumption. GDP is projected to grow by 

3.1% in 2007 in real ter
ms. Private consumption is 
foreseen to grow by 2.7%. 
This is attributed to the 
improvement in disposable income as a result of the 

increase in employment and earnings as well as the 
revised lower income tax 
rates and the fall in the rate 
of inflation. An additional contributory factor to 

higher private consumption is
 the cash de-hoarding in 
anticipation of the euro
 changeover. Public 
consumption is anticipated 
to grow by 1%, while 
investment will contract by almost 3%, as a result of 
capital purchases of an ex
ceptional nature in 2006. 
Overall, the contribution of
 domestic demand to GDP 
growth is expected to amount to around 1.5 pps. 
Despite an increase in nominal terms, real exports 
contracted during the first half of 2007. For the full 
year, real exports of 
goods and services are foreseen 
to contract by ar
ound 1.5%. The sl
owdown in exports 
is primarily driven by the subdued activity of the 
electronics sector, which accounts for a large share in 
manufacturing. Similarly, imports of goods and 
services will contract by almost 3% mainly on 

account of a sharp fall in capital imports and lower 
export activity. As a result of
 these developments, the 
external sector is projected to
 contribute positively, by 
around 1.5 pps., to GDP growth. Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Real GDP growth is expected to decelerate to 2.8% in 
2008, before increasing marg
inally to 2.9% in 2009. 
Economic activity is anticip
ated to be driven 
primarily by domestic demand in both years, while 
the contribution of the 
external sector should also be 
positive, albeit lower. Private consumption 
expenditure is projected to 
grow by 2.8% in 2008, 
supported by improved disposable income as a result 

of further lowering of personal income tax rates and 
higher transfer pa
yments. In 2009, private 
consumption is projected to decelerate to 2.7% due to 

the dissipation of one-off factors supporting 
consumption in 2008. Public consumption is projected 
to grow by slightly above 
1% in 2008 and 2009. In 
2008, gross fixed capital 
formation is anticipated to 
increase by 1.5%, reflecting a recovery from the low 
levels of the previous y
ear. For 2009, investment 
growth is projected to decelerate to 0.6% on the back 
of lower public gross fixed capital formation. Overall, 
the contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth 

is expected to amount to slig
htly below 2.5 percentage 
points in 2008 and 2.2 pps. in 2009. 
Exports of goods 
and services are expected to increase 
by 0.7% in 2008 and by 1.2% in 2009, underpinned 
primarily by a further expansion of the 
pharmaceutical industry. Exports of services are also 

projected to grow, reflectin
g a better performance of 
the tourist industry, IT and remote gaming sectors. 
After falling to 6.7% of GDP, the current account 
deficit is anticipated to
 narrow further to 3.8% of 
GDP in 2007, on the back of lower imports and a 
higher value of exports. The anticipated improvement 
in exports of services will 
further reduce the current 
account deficit in 2008 and 2009 to 3.4% and 2.6% of 
GDP, respectively. As a result of the improvement in 
the current account deficit, ne
t borrowing from the 
rest of the world 
is foreseen to declin
e throughout the forecast horizon and to be in balance by 2009. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment growth in the first half of 2007 increased 
at a brisk pace. For the 
whole year, employment is 
expected to rise by some 1.4%. The pace of 
employment creation is projected to decelerate to 
around 1.2% in 2008 - mainly owing to the 
completion of labour-intens
ive public construction 
projects Œ and remain almost unchanged in 2009. Job 

creation during the forecast period is expected to be 
generated mainly by the services sector. As a result, 
the unemployment rate is anticip
ated to progressively 
decline to 6.5% of th
e labour force by 2009.

  Despite high oil prices, HICP inflation is expected to 
slow down significantly to 0.8%
 in 2007. This mainly 
reflects declines in tourist accommodation prices as 

well as the authorities' decision to keep electricity and 
water charges to consumers almost unchanged. In 
2008, headline inflation is 
anticipated to rise to 
around 2.5%, primarily refl
ecting higher food prices. 
For 2009, HICP inflation is pr
ojected to decline to 
2.2%.  
Public finances 
The general government deficit is expected to 
continue its downward path reaching 1.8% of GDP in 
2007, mainly as a 
result of a lower current 
expenditure ratio. In 2007
, the structural balance 
(cyclically-adjusted bala
nce net of one-offs) is 
forecast to improve by slightly less than 0.5% of GDP. Taking into account the 2008 
draft budget, the deficit 
for 2008 is projected to
 decline to 1.6% of GDP, 
including a ¼% of GDP in deficit-reducing one-off 
operations. Total expenditure 
is projected to fall by 
0.3 percentage points of GDP, as a result of a lower 
current expenditure ratio. However, revenue from tax 

and social contributions is also forecast to decline, 
which will be partly offset by higher capital transfers. 
For 2009, under the no
-policy-change scenario, which takes into account 
changes in interest payments but 
excludes one-off operations (consisting of sale of 
land), the deficit is expected to be contained at 1% of 

GDP. General government debt in 2006 stood at around 
64¾% of GDP and is expected
 to fall to 
around 63% 
of GDP in 2007. Un
der the no
-policy-change scenario, the debt ratio is projected to decline further 
to around 59¼% of
 GDP by 2009.  PH_711807_CEE18. The Netherlands

 Netherlands - Net contributions to GDP 
                        growth
Activity in 2007
 Following a buoyant economic 
performance in 2006, 
GDP growth continued to be strong in the first quarter 
of 2007, posting 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, but fell in 

the second quarter to merely 0.
3%. This can in part be 
explained by a slowdown in
 the construction sector 
(due to unfavorable weathe
r conditions) and in the 
production of the chemical and steel industries. 
Another factor depressing growth was the high 
average temperature in the first half of 2007, which 

led to a sharp reduction 
in the production of gas. 
Looking beyond these te
mporary factors, the 
underlying economic growth impetus is forecast to 

remain solid. Economic activ
ity is expected to regain 
momentum in the second half of the year and annual 
GDP growth should come ou
t at around 2.7% in 2007.  
Private consumption expenditure is expected to grow 
by 1.9% in 2007, supported by continued buoyant 
labour market developments. The strong fall in 
consumer confidence in September is not likely to 

have significant adverse effects on private 
consumption growth, as consumers do not expect their 
personal financial situation to worsen significantly 
and on average continue to consider the current 
juncture to be a good time to make major purchases. 
The contribution of the 
foreign balance to GDP 
growth is expected to be around 0.3 pp. in 2007, while 
domestic sources contribute almost 2.5 pps. If the 
growth contribution of demand components is 

corrected for their respective import contents, the 
main net(
1) contribution to GDP growth in 2007 turns 
out to come from exports of goods and services, at 1.6 
pps. The net contribution of domestic sources is 1.1%. 
In fact, with export markets for Dutch products 
growing by around 6½% 
in 2007, the economy will 
be able to retain its market share, as the increase in 
unit labour costs should remain benign and in line 
with the developments of unit labour costs in the main 

competitor countries. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Economic growth prospects 
remain favourable. Real 
GDP growth is forecast to slow only marginally, to 
2.6% in 2008 and 2.5% 
in 2009. Overall, both 
domestic and external demand are expected to recede 
somewhat over the course of the forecast horizon. 
Real private consumption 
growth should again turn 
out at around 2% in 200
8, despite increases in taxes 
and social premiums that act as a brake on purchasing 
power growth. Consumption is supported by 
continued strong employment 
growth, but a small part 
of the increase in consumption is expected to be 
financed by a reduction in 
the savings rate, similar to 
2007. Real private consumption growth is forecast to 
fall to 1.6% in 2009, as accelerating consumer prices 
reduce purchasing power. The maturing economic 

cycle will reduce the need 
for expansionary private gross fixed capital formation and annual private 
investment growth should 
therefore moderate to 
around 4% in both 2008 and 2009, down from almost 
5% in 2007. 
The competitive position of
 the Dutch economy is 
expected to worsen in both 2008 and 2009, a result of 

both the assumed slowdown in world trade growth 
and the relative increase in
 unit labour costs. As a 
PH_711807_CEEChapter 3 Member States, The Netherlands 
result, export growth will fall to around 5.5% per 
year. The contribution of
 exports to GDP growth, 
corrected for its import content, will consequently 

fall, but exports remain the main engine of growth in 
both years. With exports growing slightly faster than 
imports, the current account surplus is expected to 

widen to around 8% of GDP in 2009. 
Labour markets, costs and prices 
The average number of hours worked per person is 
relatively low in the 
Netherlands (around 1400 per year in 2006), which can be
 mostly attributed to the 
high share of part-time wor
kers. It has continued to 
decline over the past couple 
of years, but this process 
is expected to be halted because of strong demand for 

labour, which benefits from the favourable economic 
conditions. In full-time 
equivalence terms, 
employment growth should come out in 2007 at 

around 1.8%, similar to 
2006. For 2008
 and 2009, 
employment growth is forecast to remain robust, but 
to slightly ease to 1.3% in 2009 in the wake of the 

increasing tightness and mismatches on the labour 
market.  The rise in labour demand is partly being met by a 
further reduction in the 
number of unemployed. The 
unemployment rate, already at 3.9% in 2006 and 3.1% 
in September 2007, is foreseen 
to fall to around 2.5% 
over the forecast horizon. However, as the total 
population of working age is expected to be stagnant 
over the forecast period as a result of demographic 

developments, most of the extra labour demand is 
being met through an 
increase in the activity rate, by 
men and women who were previously outside the 

labour force and have been encouraged to work by the 
apparent tightness of the labour market. These 
workers enter the labour market not only as 
employees, but also in increasing numbers as self-
employed. In fact, the number of self-employed is set 
to increase by around 8%, or
 100000 people, over the 
three-year forecast horizon. 
Despite the fact that the tightness of the labour market 
has been apparent since the middle of 2006, unions 
have kept their collective wage demands relatively 
subdued. Over the forecast horizon, the scarcity of 
labour is expected to pu
sh wages and salaries per full-
time equivalent progressiv
ely up, by 3.5% in 2008 
and almost 4% in 2009. Rising wage pressures are 
projected to push up unit 
labour costs by around 2.5% 
per year in both 2008 and
 2009, increasing upward 
price pressures.  
HICP inflation in the first nine months of 2007 
remained relatively subdued at 1.6%. For 2007, it is 

expected to also come out at 1.6%, as a rising 
contribution of energy pr
ice inflation is compensated 
by a low increase in rental prices of regulated 

housing. Inflation is expected to increase to 2.3% in 
2008 and 2.7% in 2009, mainly as a result of wage 
costs feeding into prices and 
of continued high energy 
prices. Furthermore, planned tax measures such as 
levies on tobacco and fuel will put further upward 
pressure on prices from 2008 onwards. 
Public finances 
The government balance is expected to deteriorate 
substantially, from a surplus of 0.6% of GDP in 2006 
to a deficit of 0.4% in 2
007. This is still around ¼% 
of GDP better than expected
 in the spring 2007 
forecast, which is mainly the result of somewhat 
higher social contributions 
and a better outcome of the 
deficit of lower levels of government. These effects 
are partly offset by lower-than-expected gas revenues, 
which follow from a lower production of gas in the 

first half of 2007. 
In 2008, the government balance is expected to 
improve markedly to a surplus of 0.5% of GDP in line 
with the government target 
in the budget for 2008. 
The planned additional expenditure outlays on health 
care and education of around 
0.4% of GDP are more 
than compensated by the expected improvement on 

the revenue side by 1.2% 
of GDP. The endogenous 
increase in tax receipts and social contributions 
implied by the above-potential growth is forecast to 

be around 0.5% of GDP, with tax elasticities 
excluding policy measures that are expected to return 
to historical values. Moreover, the budgetary 

consolidation effort of the 
newly installed government 
is concentrated on the revenue side and involves 
raising a variety of taxes and 
social contribution rates. 
The measures include higher health care 
contributions, increased levies on diesel fuel and the 
cost of leased cars, and raising excise duties on 
tobacco and alcohol. These measures are likely to 
increase receipts from taxes and social contributions 

by 0.4% of GDP. Finally, in view of continued high 
energy prices over the forecast horizon and assuming 
a pick-up in the production volume of gas in 2008,

t revenues are expected to 
increase by around 0.4% of GDP. 
Based on a no-policy-change assumption, in 2009 the 
general government balance is forecast to improve by 

0.8% of GDP, to a surplus of 1.3%. Out of this 
improvement, half a percen
t of GDP is the result of 
the reduction in the annu
al contribution of the 
Netherlands to the EU bud
get by slightly less than 
0.2% per year according to the Council decision on 
the EU own resources (cumul
ated for 2007 to 2009). 
In line with the draft budget for 2008, it is assumed in 
this forecast that all national parliaments will have 
ratified the EU budget by 2
009, so that in that year 
reimbursements for the 
years 2007 and 2008 will be 
made together with the regular contribution for 2009. 
The structural budget balance is forecast to deteriorate 
markedly in 2007, from a surplus of around 1% of 

GDP in 2006 to a slight deficit of 0.2% of GDP. In 
2008, it is foreseen to recover
 partially, to a surplus of 
½% and improve only slightly 
further in 2009. The 
underlying assumption is that there will be the 
positive one-off revenue in 
2009 of almost 0.4% of 
GDP linked to the restitution of the expected 

reduction in the EU contribution in 2007 and 2008. 
The government debt ratio is forecast to fall from 
47.9% in 2006 to 41.7% 
of GDP in 2009. The fall in 
the debt ratio can be mainly attributed to the growth 

of nominal GDP.

Forecast
Activity in 2007 
The buoyant activity that star
ted in 2006
, continued throughout the first half of 2007. Unlike other euro 
area countries, Austria did not experience a slowdown 

in the second quarter as real GDP continued growing 
steadily by 0.9% quarter-on-quarter in the first six 
months of the year.  
Growth in the first half of the year was to a large 
extent driven by gross fixed capital formation, which 
accelerated from an already strong pace in the 
previous year. Equipment 
investment in particular 
continued growing strongly, 
due to the current high 
capacity utilisation. Investment 
in construction, while 
also rising, registered a gradual slowdown.  
Against the background of the generally favourable 
economic situation in Eu
rope and particularly in 
Germany, Austria's exports 
grew strongly, even 
though a slowdown from the high rate of the previous 

year was noted. As both pr
ivate- and government- 
consumption growth have been 
sluggish in the first 
half of the year, net exports provided the major 
contribution to GDP growth.  
All in all, on an annual basis, real GDP growth is 
projected to stay at about 3.3%, with investment and 

net exports remaining the key drivers of growth.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Having maintained the quick pace of the previous 
year in 2007, GDP growth is 
expected to gradually 
slow down in 2008 and 2
009, but should remain close 
 to potential even at the end of the forecast period. The 
negative output gap, which is projected to close in 
2007, will enter and stay 
in positive territory 
throughout the forecast period.  
The profile of private consumption is expected to be 
relatively flat, whereas public consumption will slow 
down in 2009. Growth in gross fixed capital 

formation, after its sp
ectacular rebound 
in 2006, is supposed to ease down over the forecast period.  
Growth in exports of goods is expected to decelerate 
in 2008 and continue to do 
so in 2009, in line with the 
gentle slowdown projected for the other EU 
economies. However, as no 
major breakthrough in 
terms of Austria's domestic demand is foreseen, the 

contribution of net exports to real GDP growth will 
decline only marginally.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment will grow throughout the forecast 
period, more or less matching the growth level and 

profile in the euro 
area on average. With a cyclical 
recovery usually favouring 
full-time job sectors, such 
as manufacturing and construction, a higher number 
of full-time jobs are likely to be created than during 
recent years. In the view of the strong job creation, 

unemployment is projected to
 go down by about ½ 
pp. in 2007, but then remain stable as the rise in 
employment is matched by the labour force growing 

rapidly due to increased inflows of women and 
immigrants into the job 
market and older workers 
staying in it longer as a consequence of the recent 

pension reforms. 
Prices will grow marginally faster than previously 
expected, but Austria's HICP 
should stay comfortably 
around the 2% thresho
ld. In spite of the cyclical 
upturn, the increase in wages is expected to be 
moderate. Unit labour costs are projected to edge up, 
but the increase will be one of the smallest in the euro 

area, so that Austria should not experience any 
significant loss in competitiveness.   
Public finances  
The federal budget for 2007 and 2008 was adopted by 
the new parliament at the beginning of May 2007, 
giving priority in terms of expenditure to R&D, 
education and social affairs.

  Looking at the available central government revenue 
data for 2007, it seems probable that the annual 
general government deficit will turn out marginally 

lower than the official bud
get target of 0.9% of GDP. 
This is mainly due to the slightly higher-than-
expected revenues from 
personal and corporate 
income tax, as well as VAT.   
The general government deficit is expected to decline 
marginally as a percentage of GDP in 2008 and 2009, 
owing things among others to the continued 

administrative reforms, the phasing out of the 
investment premium, the effects of the previous 
pension reforms and the declining unemployment 

rate. However, at the end of the forecast period it is 
still expected to be slightly hi
gher than the target of 
0.2% of GDP presented in the latest update of the 

Stability Programme.  
Throughout the forecast period, government revenue 
and expenditure will broadly maintain their downward 
trend as a percentage of GDP.  
On the back of the relativ
ely low nominal budget 
deficits, the debt ratio 
is anticipated to decrease 
continuously over the fore
cast period. Already in 
2007, it is expected to 
fall to the 60% of GDP 
threshold for the first time since 1992.

forecast
Activity in 2007 
Economic activity continued to be robust in the first 
half of 2007. Driven by domestic demand, real GDP 
growth reached 7.1% year-on-year. Growth was 

driven by private consumption (6.0%) and investment 
(25.3%).  
Quarterly data indicate, however, some loss in 
momentum in the second
 quarter after exceptionally 
high growth in the beginning of the year due 
inter alia to a mild winter. Strong
 investment activity was 
backed up by healthy corporate profits and was 

reflected in increased cons
truction activity in the first 
half of 2007 (26.1% growth). Significant rebuilding of 
stocks has also contribute
d to high GDP growth. 
Export and import growth in
 the first half of 2007 
increased to about 10% and 14% respectively in real 
terms, year-on-year. Net 
exports contributed 
negatively to GDP growth increasingly on account of 

continuing investment activ
ity and overall strong 
private consumption.  
GDP is expected to grow at around 1¼% quarter-on-
quarter until the end of 20
07. Domestic demand will 
continue to be the main driver of growth, with a key 
role for robust gross fi
xed capital formation and 
strong consumption. Lower external demand on the 
side of the main trading partners and rising 
investment- and consumption
-driven imports will 
slow down the Polish economy in the second half of 
the year. Consumption growth is likely to be 
supported by strong wage increases (owing to a tax 

wedge cut and a tightening labour market) and a 
recovery in the labour mark
et. For the whole of 2007 
GDP is projected to grow at 6½%.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Domestic demand will continue to 
be the main driving 
force of GDP growth, 
which is expected to ease to 
5.6% in 2008 and 5.2% in 2009. Both investment and 

private consumption growth are likely to stay strong 
over the projection period. Investment is expected to 
grow at over 12% each year, supported by foreign 

direct investment and an increased inflow of EU 
funds. In 2008 Poland
 will be able to use part of the 
funds still available after th
e end of the first 
programming period 2004Œ2006, according to the 
n+2 rule. At the same time
 funds from the new 
programming period of 2007Œ2013 will already be 

flowing in. Private consumption is expected to keep 
its high momentum, albeit 
moderating slightly in 
2009. The better situation 
in the labour market and 
accelerating real wage growth because of the 
tightening labour market, a further cut in the tax 
wedge in 2008 and lower 
personal income taxes in 
2009 are the main factor
s supporting private 
consumption. Increased investments and private 
consumption will boost domestic demand and 
increase imports, which will 
enlarge the negative contribution of net expor
ts to GDP growth.  
Export growth is expected to
 slow down slightly to 
about 8% due to lower ex
ternal demand in the EU, the 
main trading partner. Rising investment- and 
consumption-driven imports 
will augment the external 
imbalances, widening the trade and current account 
deficit in 2009 to -4
¾% and -6¼% respectively. 
Thanks to higher transfers from the EU the external 
PH_711807_CEEEconomic Forecast, Autumn 2007 Poland 
deficit will be limited to 4%
 of GDP in 2009, which 
still represents a widening compared 
to the previous 
years. Labour market, costs and prices 
In the course of 2007 an impressive improvement was 
seen in the labour market, continuing the trend from 
2006. Until August 2007 the unemployment rate fell 
by more than 4½ pps. fr
om 13.8% in 2006, which 
corresponds to a decrease in the number of 
unemployed by nearly 
700,000. Although total 
employment increased (1¼% in the first half of 2007), 

part of the drop in the unemployment rate may be 
attributed to a falling labour force due to increased 
early retirement, emigration and a growing number of 

students. As economic activity is expected to be 
strong, employment
 should increase by about 7% by 
the end of the forecast horizon (compared to 2006). 

The number of unemployed is projected to reach ca. 
1.1 million in 2009, somewhat close to 7% of the 
civilian labour force. 
Annual HICP inflation increased from 2.0% in the 
first quarter of 2007 to 2.4% in the second. The 
pressure on inflation from rising wages is contained 

owing to increased competition
 among the companies. 
In view of a tightening labour market with 
unemployment rates close to, though below the 

estimate of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of 
Unemployment (NAIRU) and compensation of 
employees increasing faster than productivity, further 

monetary policy tightening is expected. Nevertheless 
inflation is likely to rise, on th
e back of higher wages 
and higher food and oil prices, to 2¾% in 2008, and to 

increase further thereafter to 
about 3%, which is 
above the Polish central bank™s medium-term target of 
2.5%.  
Unit labour costs are projected to increase by about 
4½% in 2007, as a result 
of strong wage growth 
combined with modest 
productivity increases. In 2008 
and 2009, nominal un
it labour costs are likely to continue rising, albeit at a slower pace, up to 2% as 
productivity growth recovers mitigating the impact of 
accelerating wages linked to the tightening of the 
labour market. 
 Public finances  
Since the 2007 spring forecast, the acceleration of 
GDP growth has resulted in better-than-expected 
revenues in all main tax
 categories. In particular, 
revenues from direct taxes are much higher than 
budgeted, predominantly due to dynamic wage 
growth. Spending is below the planned levels because 

of lower-than-budgeted pu
blic investment, lower 
interest expenditure thanks to lower debt growth and a 
lesser need for social spending on account of a larger-

than-projected drop in the unemployment rate. As a 
result, cash data showed that both the local and central 
government sub-sectors were still having surpluses in 

early autumn 2007. 
Consequently, the general 
government deficit is now expected to improve from 
3.8% of GDP in 2006 to 
2.7% of GDP in 2007.  
However, there still remain
s some uncertainty as 
regards the general government balance, mainly 
because local government spending may accelerate in 

the last quarter of 2007, 
as in previous years. 
The draft budget indicates a worsening of the central 
state balance (non ESA95) by about 0.3% of GDP in 
2008. Under the 
assumption that th
e draft budget is 
not modified significantly after the early 
parliamentary elections in October 2007, the general 

government deficit is expected to deteriorate to 3.2% 
of GDP in 2008 because of a number of deficit-
increasing measures adopted recently by government 

and parliament and lower GDP growth. The second 
round of social contribu
tion cuts will reduce 
government revenues by more than 1% of GDP. In 

addition, revenues will be negatively affected by large 
personal income tax reliefs related to the number of 
children in a family. On th
e expenditure side, lavish 
wage-related indexation of social benefits and 
pensions is restored, with 
generous special rules for 
2008 (indexation based on cumulated inflation for 

2006-2007 and elimination of a lower reference value, 
so called ﬁold walletﬂ). According to the draft budget, 
they will not be offset by any expenditure reform (as 

reform bills were suspended
 in view of the early 
elections) and revenue-increasing measures are 
insufficient to result in de
ficit reduction. Indirect tax 
revenues will increase as a result 
of a hike in some 
excise duties and value-added
 tax as related to EU 
harmonisation, with an estimated effect of 0.2% of 
GDP. The 2008 fiscal balance may turn out better, if 
the new government formed after the October 2007 

elections introduces some consolidating amendments.

 In 2009, the general government deficit is expected to 
improve marginally to 3.1% of GDP, broadly 
consistent with the general 
government deficit target 
in the draft 2008 budget. Further excise duty hikes 
determined by the European harmonisation will have 
a direct deficit-decreasing 
effect. On the other hand, 
parliament has already adopted a personal income tax 
reform which will entail the vast majority of tax-
payers being covered by a 
low marginal rate of 18%. 
The loss in revenue may be to some extent 
smoothened by higher proceeds due to higher private 
consumption. The cut in the statutory minimum wage 

in 2008 may have a small ne
gative impact on the 2009 
budget through 
the link which 
exists between the 
minimum wage on the one hand and some social 

benefits and wages in the public sector on the other. It 
should be stressed that this forecast is made under the 
assumption of no policy change and thus could 

become outdated, as 
fiscal policy in 2009 will be 
determined by the new government. 
Gross debt is projected
 to decrease slightly from 
47.6% of GDP in 2006 to 46.8% in 2007 and rebound 
to 47.1% in 2008 and 2009. Privatisation has been 

stalled since the beginning of 2006. If it is re-activated 
by the new government formed after the early 
elections, the debt ratio may decline faster.

Activity in 2007 
In Portugal, the first half 
of 2007 saw the continuation 
of the upswing in economi
c activity that started in late 
2005. Indicators for more recent months suggest that 

domestic demand is improving marginally, while the 
external side appears to be cooling.  
For 2007 as a whole, GDP is
 projected to grow by 
1¾% in real terms, up from 1.3% in 2006, helped by 

both domestic and external sectors. Overall, domestic 
demand has shown somewhat more strength than 
before. In particular, invest
ment stops being a drag on 
GDP growth, thanks to a 
less pronounced reduction in 
construction investment and increasing equipment 
investment. Private and public consumption patterns 

have barely changed from last year: the former 
growing below GDP, the latte
r declining. The external 
sector has continued to profit from the solid 

momentum in world trade as exports have grown at a 
healthy pace, even if less than before, with services 
exports especially evolving at brisk rates.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Portugal's GDP growth is 
expected to slightly edge up 
throughout 2008 and 2009 to around 2%. 
In the next two years, domestic demand is forecast to 
post somewhat higher contributions to GDP growth, 

mainly thanks to the expected 
recovery in investment. 
The investment pace is expected to be supported by 
the real growth of public i
nvestment, in contrast with 
the cuts of recent years. Private investment is also 
projected to perform better than before. Yet the 
uncertainty on the financial 
conditions against the 
backdrop of the recent turmoil in financial markets 
adds considerable risks to this outlook, which can be 
further compounded by
 re-assessments of demand 
prospects. Private consumption 
is expected to remain 
subdued as the rising debt 
service costs 
resulting from the tightening of mone
tary conditions, together with 
the muted labour market situation, will put a lid on 
disposable income growth.  
The external sector is forecast to
 add to GDP growth 
in 2008 and 2009, albeit by less than before. Exports 

are expected to grow at a re
latively good pace, though 
they will subside from pr
evious years as external 
demand moderates. The trend of imports should 

mainly follow that of domestic demand weighted for 
the imported content of its various components. 
The projected trade developments will continue 
narrowing the external defi
cit of goods and services. 
Yet higher primary income deficits coming from the 
rising external debt service will increase borrowing 
needs. Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment creation has been 
sluggish, reflecting the 
lagged response of employment to subdued economic 
activity, a better labour utilisation and structural 

changes with the downsizing of labour-intensive 
sectors. These trends are projected to continue in 2008 
and 2009, consequently yielding little relief to 

unemployment. Thus, wage growth is projected to 
remain at current levels. All 
in all, unit labour costs 
may grow marginally less than 
in some trade partners. 
In 2007, inflation should 
fall to below 2½% owing to 
the VAT hike in mid-2005
 and the less harmful 
energy price developments. 
Against a backdrop of 
weak demand and moderation in some import prices 

helped by a stronger euro, price pressure is expected 
to remain moderate 
in 2008 and 2009.  
Public finances 
In 2007, the general government deficit is expected to 
fall to 3% of GDP, from 3.9% of GDP in 2006. Both 

buoyant tax revenue growth
 and moderate expenditure 
growth have paved the way for this correction. In 
particular, corporate tax proceeds have grown at 
impressive rates, with further steam to revenue being 
added by other direct taxes 
and social contributions. 
At the same time, primary spending has expanded less 
than GDP. Compensation of

  has been curbed largely through wage restraint and a 
reduction in government 
employment. In addition, 
old-age pension growth has been reined in due to 

more contained retirement patterns. Unemployment 
benefits have declined on account of tighter eligibility 
criteria. Interest expenditure has gone up quickly with 

higher interest rates. (
1)  For 2008, the government deficit is projected to come 
close to 2½% of GDP. On the revenue side, tax 
revenue growth is assumed to
 be overall more in line 
with tax bases than it has been in recent years, with a 
small additional help comi
ng from changes in some 
taxes and social contributions. On the spending side, 

and taking also into account 
the draft 2008 budget, 
                                                          
 (1) This forecast assumes that capital injections in hospitals 
amounting to almost 0.1% of GDP are eligible to be recorded 
as financial transactions without a direct impact on the 

government deficit, while an amount of 0.02% of GDP will be 
booked as deficit-increasing operations every year up to 2009. 
The precise recording of those capital injections will be 

scrutinised by Eurostat at a later stage. 
expenditure is projected to continue growing below 
nominal GDP, yet by a lower marg
in than in previous 
years. On the one hand, the contained expansion of 

compensation of government employees will 
represent a sizeable consolidation effort. The latter 
will be allowed by a reduction of public employment 
by means of an only partial replacement of workers 
who leave central governm
ent. On the other hand, 
higher spending 
on some social benefits is foreseen in 
the light of new policy measures and unemployment 
benefits which are not expected to continue declining; 
at the same time, old-age pension spending will 

increase further in terms of GDP.  
In 2009, on the basis of 
the no-policy-change 
assumption, the government deficit is expected to 
decline slightly.  After reaching almost 65% of GDP in 2006, the 
government debt ratio is expected to stay at a plateau 
at some 64½% of GDP throug
hout the forecast period.

Forecast
Activity in 2007
 After reaching 7.7% in 
2006, real GDP growth slowed 
to 5.8% in the first half of 2007, mainly due to a 
deceleration of private consumption and a more 

negative contribution from net exports. However, 
growth is expected to pick up in the second half of 
2007 so that it will reach 6.0% for the year as a whole. 

This is mostly fuelled by 
gross fixed capital 
formation, thanks to record
 growth rates in the 
construction sector, and 
a rebound of private 
consumption growth. The latter is likely to benefit 
from strong wage increases and high domestic credit 
availability. From the supply sid
e, the highest growth 
rates are observed in the con
struction sector, while 
output in agriculture is e
xpected to contract owing to 
a severe drought affecting 
large parts of the country. 
Strong domestic demand dynamics will likely result 
in a further widening of the trade deficit to 15½% of 
GDP in 2007, against a 
level of around 12% in 2006. 
Net borrowing from the rest of
 the world is projected 
to widen to around 12¾% of GDP in 2007, as 
compared to 10¼% in 20
06, notwithstanding 
increasing current transfers 
from abroad link
ed to EU 
funds and remittances. Followi
ng the slowdown in 
privatisation of state-owned companies, the FDI 

coverage of net borrowing is expected to decline from 
90% in 2006 to roughly 50% in 2007. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Real GDP growth is expected to decelerate only 
slightly, to 5.9% in 2008
 and 5.8% in 2009. Strong, 
albeit somewhat slowing domestic demand is 
projected to persist over the forecast period. Gross 
fixed capital formation 
is expected to grow fastest, 
mainly owing to the con
tinued expansion in the 
construction sector, furt
her FDI inflows and the 
increased availability of EU funds. Private 
consumption growth will also remain strong due to 
high wage and continued empl
oyment growth. Public 
consumption is expected to record a steady expansion, 
mainly driven by an in
crease in public sector wages.  
Despite the decrease in domestic demand growth, the 
increase of imports is projected to continue outpacing 

the growth of exports. Th
is translates into a further 
widening of the net borrowing from the rest of the 
world, which is expected to reach around 15½% of 

GDP in 2009, in spite of 
increased EU transfers and 
higher remittances from abroad.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
In spite of the contraction of several labour-intensive 
industries (especially textiles and clothing), overall 

employment is expected to 
grow by 1¼% in 2007. 
Over the period 2008-2009 an average increase in 
employment of almost 1% is anticipated. The job 
creation process in the formal private sector will be 
sustained by foreign inve
stments, offsetting the 
ongoing lay-offs in some labour-intensive industries, 
and by a further reduction of
 the informal economy. 
Unemployment is projected
 to decline slightly over 
the forecast period.  
The steady disinflation pr
ocess over the last years 
stagnated in the first tw
o quarters of 2007 and even 
reversed in August and September on the back of 

higher domestic f
ood prices after th
e severe drought, increased world food prices and the depreciation of 
the RON since August 2007
 after a long period of 
sustained appreciation. In 
combination with strong 
demand-pull pressures, annual in
flation is projected to 
average 4¾% in 2007. In 2008, average inflation is 

projected to edge up to 5½%, largely reflecting 
negative carry-over effects from the 2007 agricultural 
supply shortfall and the 
assumed rising international 
fuel and commodity prices. In 2009, these supply-
push factors are expected to ease somewhat, leading 
to a projected moderation of the inflation rate to 4½%. 
Over the forecast period, the increased fiscal stimulus, 
the evolution of credit growth and the strong increase 

in wages will continue to put upward pressure on 
inflation from the demand side.

  Public finances 
The pro-cyclical fiscal expansion continues and the 
budget deficit is expected to deteriorate from 1.9% of 
GDP in 2006 to 2.7% of GDP in 2007, mainly due to 

an increase in government consumption, in particular 
public wages, and social transfers. Furthermore, 
under-spent public capital expenditure due to low 
execution of investment plans has been shifted to 
current spending through successive budget 
amendments. Revenues are expected to perform well 

in 2007. The poor 
performance of 
indirect taxes in the 
first quarter and a 2 pp cut in social security 
contributions will likely be offset by higher-than-

anticipated direct tax revenues.  
In 2008 and 2009, the deficit is expected to further 
widen to 3.2% and 3.9% of GDP respectively. The 
forecast assumes an almost doubling of pensions over 

2008 and 2009 compared to the level in 2007 as 
approved by law in June 2007. In addition, 2 pp of 
pension contributions in 2008 
and 2.5 pp in 2009 will 
be redirected to a funded second
 pension pillar to be 
introduced in January 2008
. This pension reform cost 
is estimated at 0.2% of GDP in 2008 and 0.3% of 

GDP in 2009 and is includ
ed in the projected deficits. 
Finally, the forecast reflects the government decision 
that the rate of social contributions will be cut by 6 pp 

in three steps in the cou
rse of 2008, which exerts its 
full impact as from 2009. 
These reforms will be partly 
financed by some recently approved measures aimed 

at enlarging the base for social contributions. 
Furthermore, public wages are expected to remain an 
important expenditure-increasing item, while gross 

fixed capital formation is projected to pick up after a 
slowdown in 2007. Direct tax revenues are expected 
to remain buoyant on the back of strong GDP growth 

and improved tax collection. 
The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by 1 
pp. between 2007 and 2009 to around 13½% mainly 
due to higher deficits.

Activity in 2007 
Economic growth in Slovenia remained buoyant in 
2007. During the 
first half of the year, real GDP 
increased by 6.5% year-on-year. Leading indicators 

for the third quarter show some 
cooling and a small 
deceleration of growth is expected for the second half 
of the year. Overall growth for 2007 is projected at 

6.0%, the highest rate in the last decade. 
An impressive build-up of fixed 
capital continued to 
be the main driving force for this year's record 
growth. Non-housing construction was particularly 

buoyant due to, inter 
alia, motorway construction and 
other infrastructure investment. Investment in 
machinery and equipment was also strong, reflecting 

high capacity utilisation in 
the manufacturing sector. 
Private consumption expenditure also remained lively, 
on the back of a high employment increase and lower 

taxation of physical persons. 
Exports of 
goods and 
services grew at very high rates during the first half of 
the year, supported by the ad
option of the euro in 
2007 and a generally favourabl
e external environment 
as well as the increased production and export 
capacity of the car manufacturing sub-sector. 
However, the external sector is expected to have a 
negative contribution to growth, due to the very high 

import growth. The latter is attributed to the strong 
demand for investment good
s as well as intermediate 
inputs used mainly in the 
production of export goods.  Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
In 2008, economic growth is projected to decelerate to 
4.6%. However, this is still well above the average 
rate of 4.2% recorded duri
ng 1997-2006. The main 
reason for the loss of momentum is the expected 
considerable slowdown in
 gross fixed capital 
formation growth. The alr
eady strong expansion of 
production capacity of the 
last years, the international 
economic slowdown and the expected deceleration in 
housing will all contribute to this. However, private 

consumption is projected to remain vigorous thanks to 
higher disposable income, cause
d by significant wage 
increases in the public and to a lesser degree the 

private sector. Exports will likely experience slower 
growth in a somewhat less dynamic euro area 
environment and due to the fact that capacity limits in 

key industries such as car manufacturing have nearly 
been reached. At the same time, the slowdown in 
investment and exports 
will also reduce import 
growth to a greater extent, resulting in a small positive 
contribution of net ex
ports to GDP growth. 
The slowdown of activity is 
expected to continue in 
2009 with a projected 
GDP growth rate of around 
4 %. Further deceleration of capital formation is 
expected to be the driving force of this development. 
In particular, construction is projected to expand only 
marginally, as investment in
 motorway construction 
levels off. Private consumption is forecast to weaken 

somewhat, but remain buoyant.
 Exports are projected 
to grow at high, but somewhat lower, rates of growth 
compared to the preceding years. Imports are 

expected to increase more moderately, reflecting the 
slowdown in investment 
and consumption demand. 
Overall, net exports are projected to widen their 

positive contribution to growth. The current account 
deficit is expected to declin
e to around 1.8% of GDP. 
Labour markets, costs and prices 
Consumer price inflation in
creased markedly in 2007 
and is projected to reach an average level of 3.5% for 

the year as a whole, compar
ed to 2.5% in 2006. 
Several indicators point to rising demand pressures; 
surveys of firms report the reaching of capacity levels 

and lack of skilled pe
rsonnel; unemployment has 
fallen to the lowest level 
recorded since Slovenia's 
independence and the economy is likely experiencing 
a positive output gap. Mo
reover, the in
creases in food 
and energy prices experienced by most euro-area 

countries and low competition 
in some sectors of the 
economy also contributed 
to the rise in inflation. 
Although euro changeover effects appeared limited 

initially, some abnormal price increases were reported 
following the end of the 
dual price display in June.

  In 2008, inflation is proj
ected to rise to 3.7%. 
Although there is a very 
high degree of uncertainty, 
the slowdown in nationa
l activity is likely to be 
overcompensated by rising wage pressures as well as 
increases in commodity and energy prices. Slovenia is 
especially vulnerable to changes in oil prices due to 

the high share of energy in HICP. Also, food prices 
might experience further increases. Wage pressures 
arise mainly from the government's efforts to reduce 

income disparities within th
e public sector, which are 
expected to lead to a substantial increase of the public 
sector wage bill in 2008. Due to demonstration 

effects, significant increases might also be expected 
for private sector wages. However, inflation is 
expected to revert to lower levels in 2009. 
Labour market developments 
have been favourable in 
2007, with the 
increase in employment projected to 
reach 2.2%, having been especially strong in 
construction. Unemployment 
is projected to have 
fallen to around 5% in 
2007 and is now likely below 
the natural rate. It is expected
 to decline further in 
2008 and 2009, while employment growth is expected 
to slow down due to the deceleration of economic 
activity. Public finances 
The general government defic
it is expected to narrow 
to 0.7% of GDP in 2007, well below the 1.5% 
projected in spring. This 
is primarily due to the fact 
that general government revenue increased markedly, 

despite the comprehensive tax reform. Higher-than-
expected GDP growth and a tax
-rich composition of 
growth helped achieve 
this result. Also, expenditure 
increased more slowly than in 2006. 
Revenues as a share of GDP are expected to decline 
over the forecast period as the tax reform continues. 
Given rising public sector wages and slower growth, 

the general government deficit is projected to increase 
to 1.0% of GDP in 2008. It
 will, however, revert to 
0.8% in 2009. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to 

decline further, falling below 24% in 2009.

Activity in 2007 
In 2006, real GDP growth increased to 8¼%. It was 
primarily driven by domestic 
demand but the external 
contribution also entered 
positive territory. In 2007, 
data for the first two 
quarters suggest that economic 
growth may accelerate further to around 8¾%. It

particularly by investment 
and private consumption, 
but the external growth

become stronger.

projects in the corporate sector should keep gross 

fixed capital formation growth above 7%. New export 
capacities in the manufactur
ing sector are likely to 
keep export growth at aro
und 20%, outpacing imports 
by some 4 pps.  
A rapidly falling trade de
ficit should lead to a 
decrease in net borrowing 
from the rest of the world 
to around 4¼% of GDP in 2007. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Economic expansion is expected to gradually 
decelerate to around 7% and 6¼% in 2008 and 2009 
respectively. Domestic demand is 
likely to remain the 
main driving force of growth. The positive external 
contribution should peak in 2007, when most of the 
new export capacities enter production, while 
remaining positive in 
2008 and 2009.  
A steadily improving 
labour market situation 
combined with strong cred
it growth is expected to 
continue to support private consumption growth, 
which, despite slowing 
down, is likely to remain at 
above 5% over the forecast period. Gross fixed capital 
formation should decelerate only marginally as 
Slovakia continues to a
ttract new FDI projects. 
Decelerating investment, consumption and exports 
should contribute to a slow
down in import growth, 
while the continued launchi
ng of new production 
capacities in the manufacturi
ng sector is likely to 
ensure that exports continue to outpace imports over 
the forecast horizon. 
Increasing net exports sh
ould lead to further 
improvements in the external balances in 2008 and 
2009.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
Total employment is expected to increase by some 2% 
in 2007 while the unemp
loyment rate is likely to 
decrease to close to 11%. Similar, though slower, 
trends are anticip
ated in 2008 and 2009 as strong 
domestic demand and newly built export production 
capacities are expected to continue to provide 
additional employment 
opportunities. Nominal unit 
labour costs growth is likely to accelerate from 2007 
onwards, due to decelerating productivity growth.    
Thanks to lower increases in 
regulated prices in the 
energy sector at the beginni
ng of 2007 and the 
positive impact of exch
ange rate appreciation, HICP 
inflation is anticipated to 
drop to around 1¾% in 
2007. An increase in excise taxes on cigarettes and 

accelerating electricity, water and food prices are 
expected to push the annual average HICP inflation 
up to some 2½% in 2008. The fading out of the 

positive impact of the exchange rate pass-through 
combined with higher energy prices and a further 
increase in the excise taxes on cigarettes should cause 

HICP inflation to increase further to some 3% in 
2009. Public finances 
The general government defic
it (including the pension 
reform costs) increased to 3¾% of GDP in 2006, but 
was still some ½ pp. lower th
an foreseen in the 2006 
budget, mainly thanks to
 lower-than-budgeted co-
financing needs for EU
-sponsored projects.  
In 2007, stronger-th
an-expected economic growth is 
likely to result in higher tax and dividend revenue

 which together with 
lower-than-expected interest 
expenditure should enable the government to bring 
the deficit below its target of 2.9% of GDP despite 

higher-than-foreseen transfers to the second pension 
pillar. However, as in previous years, the positive 
impact of better-than-expected fundamentals may 

again be partly offset by some unbudgeted 
expenditures.    
In 2008, revenue-increasing measures adopted by the 
government should generat
e additional revenue of 
around ¼% of GDP. These measures include a 
broadening of the corporate tax base, an increase in 
the maximum ceiling on social contributions and the 

introduction of energy taxes. At the same time, 
pension eligibility criteria are 
anticipated to be 
slightly tightened.  Moreover, the government is considering some 
modifications to the second
 pension p
illar, which was 
introduced in 2
005. Potential significant reductions in 
contributions redirected to the second pillar (currently 
expected at some 1¼% of GDP) could induce a lower 
deficit outcome than the 
government's current 2008 
target of 2.3% of GDP, if 
not offset by unbudgeted 
public spending.  
Under the customary no-policy-change assumption, 
the budget deficit (including the pension reform costs) 
is projected to increase to 
some 2½% of GDP in 2009, 
due to decelerating growth. 
Gross public debt is expect
ed to remain broadly stable

HICP%Forecast
Activity in 2007  
According to preliminary
 national accounts data,
 YoY GDP growth reached 5.5% and 4.4% in the first and 
second quarter of 2007 respectively, well above the 

potential growth estimate of about 3%. This 
represents only a slight deceleration from 2006, when 
GDP growth reached 5% for the year. Growth has 

remained broad-based, with a strong contribution 
from foreign demand. However, export prices have 
persistently risen consid
erably more slowly than 
import prices. The resulting strong negative 
terms-of-trade effect together 
with relatively subdued 
wage growth has limited the upward pressures on 

domestic demand. Private consumption growth 
slowed down in the second
 quarter, but this does not 
seem to signal a comprehensive turn in consumer 

behaviour. Household confidence has remained steady 
at high levels an
d optimism is likely 
to be supported 
by rapidly rising wages
 in the coming years. 
Investment growth accelerated strongly in the first 
half of 2007, especially on account of non-residential 
construction and equipment investment. As in the 
previous year, exports are driven mainly by the metal 
engineering industries, which benefit from robust 

global demand for investment goods. Leading 
indicators point that growth
 should remain overall 
buoyant in the second half of 2007.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009  
Economic growth is forecast to gradually moderate 
from the cyclical peak in 
2006 and 2007. The main 
stimulus to growth over the forecast period is 
expected to come from private consumption. In 2008, 
this should be supported by a rapid rise in wage 
growth, but will abate in 20
09 in line with slowing 
disposable income gr
owth. Higher interest rates and a 
relatively high household de
bt burden should curb 
consumer spending as well as housing investment. 
Nonetheless, investment growth
 is still expected to be 
upheld in 2008 by a sharp rise in government sector 
investment and capital expenditure in industry 
encouraged by continued
 high capacity utilisation 
rates. However, these factors are forecast to subside in 
2009. Government consump
tion will rise markedly in 
2008 on account of the new government frontloading 

its expenditure increases. Thereafter, government 
expenditure is forecast to slow in 2009, helped also by 
the programme to boost pr
oductivity in the public 
sector. Export growth is expected to be increasingly 
constrained by capacity constraints in the metal 
engineering industry, which is still expected to remain 

the fastest growing branch 
of industry. Export 
prospects in the wood and paper industries appear less 
favourable over the medium term, threatened by a 
sharp rise in Ru
ssian round-wood exp
ort duties in the 
coming years, which could effectively cut a 

significant source of raw-wood imports. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment growth has been exceptionally fast over 
2006-2007, expanding by
 about 2% annually. 
Persistent labour shortages are evident in some 

industrial, construction and service branches and the 
number of job vacancies has been rising steadily. The 
employment rate is expected 
to surpass 70% of the 
working age population in 2007 and rise further in 
2008 and 2009, albeit at a decelerating pace. 
Unemployment is predicted to drop below 6½ % of 

the labour force by 2009, which is close to its 
estimated structural level
. The growing tightness in 
the labour market combined with decelerating 

economic activity should gradually constrain 
employment growth.  
The labour market bottlenecks
 did not lead to a 
noticeable wage drift in 2007 as wages remained 
strongly guided by the 
previous central wage 
agreement. The next round of wage agreements will 

be settled at sector level. 
They are likely to reflect 
some of the wage pressures that have built up over the 
past few years. Wage growth is set to accelerate 

sharply in 2008, reflecting also some frontloading of 
wage rises, followed by 
a slow down in the following

 year. As a result, unit labour costs should rise 
considerably faster in 2008-2009 than on average over 
the previous decade.  
During the first half of 2
007, HICP inflation remained 
stable overall, although a slight acceleration was 
visible in the core index
. At the same time, CPI 
inflation accelerated sharply during the first half of 

2007 to about 2½% YoY. This is about 1 pp. higher 
than HICP growth, due to
 differences in the index 
basket. The national index basket includes owner-

occupied housing and interest rate costs. After several 
years of subdued 
inflation, HICP inflation is expected 
to peak temporarily at 2½% in
 2008, of which ½ pp. 
is explained by alcohol 
and energy tax hikes and 
rising health care fees. Inflat
ion should decelerate in 
2009 as these temporary factors fade. Also, the 

foreseen cuts in food VAT 
rates in the last quarter of 
2009 should reduce consumer price growth. 
Nevertheless, due to the ra
pidly rising wages and unit 
labour costs, annual average inflation is forecast to 
remain slightly above 2% over the forecast period.  
Public finances  
The general government surplus
 is expected to peak in 
2007 at 4½% of GDP, which is
 the highest level it has 
been during the current cyclical upswing. The bulk of 

the surplus originates from social security 
accumulating pension fund assets, which has in the 
recent years consistently recorded a surplus of 3% of 

GDP. The current rise in the 
surplus is driven by 
central government, where expenditure ceilings have 
helped to maintain expe
nditure restraint during the 
good economic times.  Also, local governments have 
recorded marginally stronger fiscal balances on the 
back of strong tax and non-tax revenues. The 

frontloading of the new 
government expenditure in 
2008 will reduce the surplus 
to about 4% of GDP in 
2008 and also in 2009. The government debt ratio is 

projected to decline steeply, to about 30% of GDP by 
2009. PH_711807_CEE26. Sweden Strong economy and healthy public finances here to stay

Activity in 2007 
In the first half of 2007, 
the Swedish economy has 
continued to grow at a good pace, albeit more slowly 
than the historically high 
growth rate recorded in 
2006. GDP growth has been supported by favourable 
domestic conditions, such as a marked increase in 
disposable incomes, fo
llowing from lower taxes, 
higher wages and a rapid increase in employment.  
Investments have also been bo
oming, supported by 
high capacity utilisation, 
good profitability in the 
enterprise sector and a rap
id expansion of residential 
construction. Moreover, solid local government 
finances have contributed to resilient public 

consumption growth. 
Nonetheless, private consu
mption has not provided 
the strong boost to the economy that might have been 
expected. Rather consumers appear to be only slowly 

reacting to the increase in disposable incomes, 
implying a rise in the savings ratio. External demand 
has also softened with declin
ing export growth of 
goods. This is partly due to 
a weakening in
ternational 
investment cycle, but may also be attributed to an 
unfavourable composition of exports, a strengthening 
of the exchange rate and capacity problems in the 
export sector.   
All in all, real GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 
about 3½% in 2
007, with a negativ
e contribution from 
net exports for the first 
time since 1998.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
In the coming two years, the economy is projected to 
decelerate gradually to about 3% in 2008 and 2½% in 
2009. This is slightly below estimated potential 
growth rates. 
Notably, investment growth 
is expected to normalise 
as production capacity is restored and interest rates 

increase. No clear signs of a slowdown in real estate 
prices are yet visible, but slower residential 
construction is noneth
eless likely to contribute to 
weaker investment growth, owing notably to 
emerging labour shortages and higher construction 
costs. While private consumption is eventually 

expected to respond to the earlier increase in 
disposable incomes as well 
as to additional income 
tax cuts, consumers are still lik
ely to remain cautious 
due to the uncertainty associated
 with the financial 
market turbulence in 2007. Consequently, private 
consumption is not anticipat
ed to provid
e any strong 
impetus to GDP growth over the forecast period and 
the savings ratio is expected to remain high.  
Following from the increase 
in production capacity, 
export growth is foreseen to 
recover somewhat, but 
will be contained by slower US growth and a 
deceleration of growth in the other Nordic countries. 
Nevertheless, net exports are 
estimated to contribute 
again to GDP growth as import demand declines, 
although only marginally.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market has st
rengthened 
markedly in 2007, partly due to a pent-up need for new hiring after 
a period of jobless growth and partly as a result of 
various labour market measures taken by the 

government. Employment growth is estimated to 
exceed 2% and unemployment is set to fall by about 1 
pp. in 2007 to around 6%. The labour market is 

expected to remain strong 
in 2008 and
 2009, but 
unemployment is projected 
to level out at around 
5½% as the effects of the government's labour market 

policies will also increase labour supply.  
Amidst a strong economic expansion, increased 
demand for labour and high profitability, the 2007 
wage negotiation round 
will lead to higher wage 
growth over the forecast period, exceeding 4½%. 
Higher wage growth, combined with weaker 
productivity growth, is pred
icted to lead to rising unit 
labour costs and to have a negative impact on 
competitiveness.

 During 2007, inflation has gradually picked up, 
though from a very 
low level. Increasing domestic 
cost pressures and rising food prices are projected to 

contribute to a further 
gradual increase in inflation to 
about 2% in 2008 and 2009. As both headline and 
underlying inflation is increasing, the Riksbank is 

expected to continue tightening monetary policy and 
to increase its repo rate in 2008.       
Public finances 
In particular owing to healthy economic growth, the 
public finances situation 
is currently stro
ng. Despite various expansionary elem
ents contained in the 2007 
budget, including reductions
 of both income and 
wealth taxes, the strengtheni
ng of the labour market 
has contributed to both higher-than-foreseen tax 
revenue and lower expe
nditure. As a result, the 
surplus is anticipated to increase to 
about 3% of GDP 
in 2007.  These underlying trends are forecast to spill over into 
the coming years and the budgetary target (1% surplus 
over a 7-year rolling period) is likely to be met with a 
significant margin over th
e whole forecast period, 
with fiscal surpluses in the 
rage of 2¾-3% in both 
2008 and 2009. In parallel, 
further income tax cuts 
and a policy aimed at containing public expenditure 
are expected to lead to a continued reduction of both 

revenue and expenditure as a share of GDP.  
On the basis of continued high general government 
surpluses, the government debt ratio is projected to be 
further reduced to about 30% of GDP in 2009. This 

reduction is supported by th
e government's plans to 
sell stakes in various state-owned enterprises that are 
estimated to amount to roughly 2 percent of GDP per 

year.

with GDP growth of 0.8% in each quarter. Looking 

ahead, however, it seems increasingly likely that the 
recent turbulence in world financial markets and the 
global re-pricing of risk will have a dampening effect 

on the UK economy in the near to medium term. As a 
result, economic activity in the 
final quarter of 2007 is 
likely to moderate; overall GDP 
growth in 2007 is 
expected to reach 3.1% after 2.8% in 2006.  
The economy's continued expansi
on in the first half of 
this year was primarily dri
ven by robust growth in 
private consumption, boosted by wealth effects from 

resilient house price growth. Growth in real 
disposable household income, however, remained 
muted, leading to a further 
fall in the saving ratio to 
only 2.6%, compared to 5.0% in 2006. In the second 
half, private consumption growth is expected to 
remain positive, but to weaken slightly as house price 

growth moderates and consumer borrowing slows due 
to a more restrictive overall credit environment and an 
increase in precautionary savings. 
Total investment growth decelerated in the first half 
of the year, following vigorous growth in 2006. The 
moderation was mainly driven by business 

investment, which stalled after strong growth over the 
second half of 2006. Going forward, gradually 
tightening credit conditions sh
ould temper the growth 
of overall investment.  
Government consumption and expenditure relating to 
the building up of inventories also provided a minor 
additional stimulus 
to growth in the first half, and the 
former is expected to pick up throughout the rest of 
2007. Net external demand is expected to make a 

small negative growth contribution in 2007 as a 
whole, with the external deficit around 3% of GDP.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009
 The economic outlook for the next two years is 
largely shaped by developments in the housing market 

and the financial sector, both of which are likely to 
dampen growth in 2008.  
The central outlook 
envisages a slowing of private 
consumption over the forecast period, driven 

primarily by a slowdown in
 house price growth and a 
related weakening of wealth effects on consumption. 
In addition, household sp
ending growth is also likely 
to slow on account of a more restrictive borrowing 
environment. Whilst positive 
employment growth and 
moderate increases in earnings will support private 

consumption, its contribution to overall growth will 
probably be somewhat weaker over the coming years. 
Investment is also set to slow in 2008 on account of 
tighter lending condition
s for corporations. Both the 
availability and the price of corporate credit have tightened since the summer and are expected to 

become more difficult over the near to medium term. 
This will dampen business 
investment in 2008, 
though investment should return to robust levels in 

2009 due to healthy 
corporate profitability and 
mounting pressures on
 productive capacity, 
particularly in manufacturing.  
Government spending looks set
 to continue providing 
PH_711807_CEEChapter 3 Member States, The United Kingdom a moderate stimulus in 20
08, with revised plans 
envisaging somewhat higher overall expenditure in 
2008 than expected at the time of the spring forecast.  
The growth contribution of net external demand is 
expected to improve in 2008, when net exports move 
from constituting a slight 
drag on growth to being 
almost neutral. This develop
ment is driven by a 
slowdown in imports in 
line with the predicted 
moderation of domestic demand growth, and 
outweighs the growth of expor
ts due to more subdued 
growth in key markets such as the US and the euro 
area(1). Income account receipts will weaken 
somewhat due to global 
financial developments, but 
overall should still be suppo
rted by resilient global 
growth, thus continuing to
 help finance the UK's 
substantial trade deficit. Th
e external account is therefore likely to remain in 
deficit, of around 3½% of 
GDP over the forecast period.   
In summary, growth in the UK economy is expected 
to slow to 2.2% in 2008. The expected recovery to 

around 2½% in 2009 will be ma
inly thanks to a pick-
up in investment. This central scenario is subject to 
downside risks. Future devel
opments in the financial 
sector are still highly unce
rtain but could prove 
pivotal, given the relativ
ely large size of the UK's 
financial sector: a protracted
 downturn in financial 
sector activity would have a direct impact on both 
growth and employment.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market continues
 to perform well, with 
high rates of employment 
(projected at 71.4% in 
2007) and low unemployment. Over the forecast 
period employment growth 
is expected to slow 
slightly as a result of a general moderation in activity. 
The supply of labour is also projected to increase at a 
slower pace, reflecting reduced immigration, and 

leading to a stable unemployment rate over the next 
two years.  Indications of the labour mark
et tightening slightly in 
2007 have so far not 
translated into upward pressure 
on average earnings growth.  Future earnings and 
wage growth are not expected to diverge from a 
broadly stable trend, and a fall in HICP inflation over 
                                                          
 1 The projections for export and import volumes in 2007 exclude 
the impact of Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud 
on trade figures. the summer months to below 2% has eased the 
likelihood of stronger increases in wages in the 
months ahead. HICP inflation 
looks set to settle at just 
above 2% in 2008, 
with risks from food and energy 
price developments tilted to
 the upside over the 
medium term. 
Public finances 
Following the reduction in the general government 
deficit in the 2006/07 financial year(
2), slower than 
expected economic growth and an increase in planned 
spending are expected to have significant adverse 

effects on public finances. 
The deficit in the UK is 
forecast to rise to around 3% of GDP in 2007/08 and 
to remain around the sam
e level in 2008/09.
   The general government deficit in 2006/07 was 2.6% 
of GDP, 0.1 pp. lower than 
that estimated in the 
spring 2007 forecast. The table below shows the 
financial-year projections
 for general government 
deficit and debt:

 In the current financial year, the deficit is expected to 
increase by 0.4 pp. of GDP in structural terms. The 
revenue-to-GDP ratio is no
w forecast to edge 
downwards from 2006/07, compared with an 
expectation in the spring of a moderate increase. 
The slowdown in economic ac
tivity in the second half 
of the financial year is e
xpected to lead to a 
deceleration in revenue growth. A discretionary 
increase in air passenger duty, coupled with measures 
aimed at reducing tax avoidance, should raise 

revenues by 0.2% of GDP, but is offset by higher tax 
repayments to companies overpaying corporate tax in 
previous years, which are expected to reduce intakes 

by 0.2% of GDP.  
On the expenditure side, the 
projections assume that 
the government will meet 
its latest plans for non-

  cyclical primary expenditure, as released in the 
October 2007 Pre-Budget Repo
rt and Comprehensive 
Spending Review. Total expen
diture in 2007/08 is 
now projected to be 0.2% of GDP higher than 
envisaged in the March 2007 Budget, partly as a 
consequence of a national accounts reclassification. 
The headline deficit in 2008/
09 is expected to remain 
little changed from 2007/08. With growth slowing to 
below potential and the negative output gap widening 
further, the structural deficit is projected to fall by 0.1 

pp. of GDP. Revenue growth is expected to slow, 
dampened by the weaker economic context, and more 
specifically by reduced corporate profitability, 

especially from the financial sector.  Discretionary tax 
measures coming into force in
 April 2008 will have a 
neutral effect on public finances. In particular, 

increased revenues from the removal of the 10% 
starting rate of tax on employment income and the 
reduction in allowances fo
r investment will largely 
finance reductions in the basic rate of personal income 
tax and in the main corporate tax rate. 
On the other hand, the spending envelope set out by 
the government in its Comprehensive Spending 
Review implies a significant deceleration in  

spending. The ex
penditure-to-GDP ratio is 
nevertheless expected to rise 
slightly in 2008/09, with 
both current and capital 
expenditure contributing. 
In 2009/10, the forecast projects some limited fiscal 
consolidation, with 
the deficit reduced to around 2¾% 
of GDP.  The weak improvement is expected to be 
driven by the combined effect of a higher receipts 

ratio, partly discretionary bu
t boosted by an improved 
macroeconomic context, and continued slower growth 
in government expenditure, which should contribute 

to a slight reduction in the expenditure ratio.  
General government gross debt is expected to increase 
by 2½ pps. of GDP during the forecast period, up 
from 42.6% of GDP at the end of 2006/07.

                  (annual percentage growth)  
 Developments in 2007 
In the first half of 2007, real GDP growth accelerated 
to 6.8%, up from 4.8% in 2006. Growth continued to 
be driven by continued effi
ciency gains as well as 
accelerated employment growth. From the demand 
side, it is supported by st
rong domestic demand.  
Private and public consumption growth accelerated 

markedly and gross fixed capital formation spending 
remained strong, supported
 by an expansion of private 
sector investments. High-fr
equency indicators suggest 
a continuation of relativ
ely strong economic activity in the third quarter. Industri
al production expanded by 
5.7% and retail trade by 8.2%
 year on year on average 
in July and August.  
Average annual consumer
 price inflation declined 
slightly from to 3.3% in 20
05 to 3.2% in 2006. 
Despite a recent increase in
 agricultural and food 
prices, average inflation declined further to 2.2% in 
the first nine months of 2007. Real wage growth 
remained broadly in line with productivity gains. 
The current account deficit 
stood at 7.8% of GDP in 
the twelve months to June 2007, unchanged compared 
to 2006. The merch
andise trade deficit remained at 
24.7% of GDP while trade in services posted a surplus 
of 16.9% of GDP. In the twelve months to June, net 
inflows of FDI reached 9.1% of GDP, up from 7.4% 

in 2006, and 
were largely driven by privatisation and 
recapitalisation of banks. 
In the first half of 2007
, total revenues of the general 
government increased by 
13.1% year-on-year, while spending rose by 6.7%, resulting in a small cash 
surplus of 0.3% of GDP. The stock of general 
government debt stood at 38
% of GDP at the end of 
June 2007. Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
The economic performance is expected to remain 
robust over the forecast horizon. Growth will continue 

to be driven by strong domestic demand. In 2007, real 
GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to around 6%, 
from 4.8% in 2006. Continued strong credit growth 

and consumer confidence, debt repayments to 
pensioners, increases in wages and social transfers as 
well as realised capital gains by private households 

will contribute to stronge
r private consumption 
growth. Recent increases in public sector wages and 
the expansion of spending in the pre-election context 

will lead to a marked acceleration of public 
consumption. Investment growt
h remains at double-
digit levels, supported by strong private investor 

confidence and a generally supportive business 
environment. In 2007, imports of goods and services 
will continue to rise faster th
an exports, and the 
contribution of net exports is set to turn more 
negative. However, in 200
8 and 2009 the negative 
contribution will become 
smaller, as export growth 
will accelerate as a result of a relatively favourable 
external environment, 
increased competitiveness and 
a stronger tourism sector.  
Some of the effects that are boosting domestic 
demand in 2007 will weaken 
in 2008. In particular, 
one-off payments to pensioners will be lower and 

public consumption is set to decelerate after the 
elections. Also, central bank measures to restrict 
credit growth may eventually have some impact on 

private households' spending. As a result, GDP 
growth will slow somewhat, to
 5%, in 2008. In line 
with the general trend of past years, and supported by 

previous capital accumulation, strong confidence and 
firmer prospects of EU accession, a slight acceleration 
of growth is again foreseen for 2009. 
The size and composition of external balances is 
forecast to remain rather stable over the forecast 
horizon. The trade deficit is forecast to stay at around 
24.5% of GDP. Exports will further increase, but are 
unlikely to outperform im
ports, which will continue 
to be driven by domestic consumption and a high 

import content of exports 
and investments. A slight 
lowering of the current acc
ount deficit to 8% of GDP 
will result mainly from a 
better performance of tourism. Net inflows of foreign direct investment are

Growth and investment dynam
ics are expected to lead 
to an acceleration of employment growth in 2007, 

though it will slow some
what thereafter. This allows a reduction of the unemployment rate to around 10% at 
the end of the forecast period. Due to a stable 

environment with relatively low inflation, a 
significant increase in wage pressures is unlikely to 
occur, despite expected wage hikes in some public 

companies. Average real wages are forecast to grow 
more slowly than averag
e productivity gains, leading 
to a lowering of real 
unit labour costs. Despite recent increases in agricultural and food 
prices, annual average consumer price inflation is 
forecast to further decrease to 2.5% in 2007. It is 
expected to slightly 
increase to 3% in 2008 and 2009, 
driven by further adjustme
nts of administrative prices 
and catching-up effects.  
Public finances 
Due to strong revenue grow
th, combined with some 
additional spending in the revised 2007 budget, the 
general government deficit (E
SA 95) is projected to 
remain at around 2.2% in 
2007. Lower increases of 
government consumption in 2008 and 2009 will 
support a gradual and minor deficit reduction. At the 

same time, spending on social transfers and subsidies 
will remain strong. The pub
lic debt ratio is expected 
to be reduced to slightly abo
ve 37% of GDP by 2009. 
Debt reduction will 
continue to be supported by 
revenues from privatisati
on, although they will 
slightly decline relative to GDP over the forecast 
horizon. PH_711807_CEE2. The former Yugoslav Republic of

%%Developments in 2007 
Output expanded by some 
5½% during the first half 
of the year, compared to 3½% the year before. A key 
impulse for this improved growth dynamic came from 

the export sector, which bene
fited from strong global 
demand for basic materials. Private consumption and 
investment remained in
 line with the overall 
performance. Industrial ou
tput rose only moderately 
so far, reflecting lower production of electricity and 
textiles. For the whole year, real GDP growth is 

expected to be close to 5%.   
Employment increased by nearly 4% in the first half 
of 2007, mainly due to a strong rise in self-
employment. The number of unemployed declined by 

about ½%. These two factors brought the average 
unemployment rate down from 36.2 % in the first half 
of 2006 to 35.4 % in the 
first half of 2007.  
Inflation declined to 1.
4% year-on-year during the 
first nine months of the ye
ar, reflecting the petering 
out of the base effect of last year's increase in excise 
taxes. For the whole year, consumer price inflation is 
set to reach some 1¾%, mainly as a result of higher 
food prices after the dry summer.  
External imbalances continued to narrow during the 
first half of 2007. The trade deficit dropped to some 
13% of GDP, compared to nearly 20% a year before, 
benefiting from a favourable 
development of external 
demand and rising metal prices. Private transfers 
remained high, at some 17% of GDP, compared to 
16% the year before. As in the past, the main 

component of those inflows was workers' remittances. 
Overall, the current account showed a significant 
surplus in mid-2007. How
ever, stronger domestic 
demand during the second half of the year and an 
expected dividend payment 
abroad could bring the 
current account deficit to close to 3% of GDP. 
Public finances registered marked surpluses during 
the first half of the year, resulting from a stronger 
revenue performance and lower
-than-planned public 
investment. The author
ities have recently adopted 
additional spending measu
res, which could bring the 
deficit close to 1% of GDP. Mainly as a result of 

already implemented early debt repayments, the debt 
ratio is likely to drop sign
ificantly to some 27% of 
GDP by the end of the year. 
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
For 2008 and 2009, the 
positive impact of the global 
economy is expected to subside, in particular given 
the expected growth moderation in the country's main 
trading partners. Nevertheless, the country's overall 

growth performance is likely to be higher than in the 
past, benefiting not only from stronger consumer 
confidence, but also from the positive effects of 
recently taken structural measures to improve the 
business environment. As a result, domestic demand 

is likely to increasingly suppo
rt economic dynamics, 
compensating the weakening external impulse.  
Overall, economic activity is expected to accelerate 
further, with GDP growth at some 5½% in 2008. In 

2009, less buoyant export markets will be the main 
factors dampening growth to some 5¼%. The biggest 
contribution to this acceleration will come from 

private (domestic and foreign
) investment, reaping the 
benefits of the recent measures to improve the 
business environment. As a result, the investment-to-

GDP ratio is expected to 
converge towards levels 
observed in other catching-up economies. Private 
consumption will be another important pillar for 

stronger growth, benefiting from improving consumer 
confidence, increased employment and low inflation, 
which will translate into 
a strong increase in real 
disposable income. Pub
lic consumption will rise 
faster than GDP in 2008, reflecting an already 
adopted strong rise in pu
blic sector wages and a more 
active fiscal policy stance, leading to higher 
expenditures.  
The increasing role of domestic demand and in 
particular the high impor
t content of investment will 
lead to a negative contribution of net exports to GDP

  growth. The trade balance is likely to deteriorate, in 
particular in 2008. However, workers' remittances and 
other capital inflows are expected to largely finance 

those deficits.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The stronger growth 
performance will translate into additional employment 
and a decline in the 
unemployment rate. Given th
e very low employment 
ratio, a large part of the new jobs will be filled by so 
far unregistered labour. This will 
dampen the decline 
in the number of unemployed. Overall, employment is 

expected to increase by close to 4% on average in 
2008 and 2009, in partic
ular in the category of self-
employed. Unemployment 
is likely to decline to some 
33% of the labour force.  
Consumer price inflation 
is likely to remain low. 
Increasing wages and higher 
energy prices will lead to 
an acceleration in inflation. However, the de facto peg 

to the euro will help to 
keep import prices close to EU 
levels and the reduction in the tax burden will dampen 
the increase in the cost of living. Thus, annual 
inflation is likely to remai
n below 3% over the 
forecast period.  
Public finances 
Rising expenditure, in particu
lar on the country's 
infrastructure and institutio
ns, will result in a shift 
from the close-to-balance deficits or surpluses of the 
previous years to higher deficits 
in the near future. In 
2008, the deficit is expected to reach 1½% of GDP. In 
2009, higher revenues, benefiting from the stronger 
role of domestic demand and
 improved efficiency in 
tax collection, could reduce the deficit towards 1¼% 
of GDP. The debt ratio is expected to continue to 
decline, reflecting strong 
nominal GDP growth and a 
continued policy of repaying public debt early. As a 
result, the debt-to-GDP ratio could fall to some 23% 
by 2009.   PH_711807_CEE3. Turkey Sustained growth in a context of reduced fiscal imbalances

Turkey - GDP growth and contributions 
 %Forecast
Developments in 2007 
Real GDP growth fell from 6.1% in 2006 to 5.3% in 
the first half of 2007, chiefly due to weaker private 
consumption, which was partly 
driven by the tighter 
monetary stance, higher interest rates and lower 
lending. Public consumption and investment increased 
by respectively 8% and 25% in
 the first six months of 
2007. The contributions of the external sector changed 
substantially. Imports grew at 7% in 2006 and by 6% 
in the first half of 200
7. Export growth rose from 
8½% in 2006 to 13½% in th
e first six months of 2007. 
Inflation fell significantly after going up in early 
2006, in large part du
e to faltering price pressures in 
the service sector. Consumer price inflation fell from 

around 11% in 2006 to 7% in the third quarter of 
2007, still far above the year-end target of 4%. 
Meanwhile high real 
interest rates of above 10% per 
annum are inviting large capital 
inflows and putting 
upward pressure on the Turkish lira. After three years of strong gr
owth with almost no job 
creation, employment started to rise in 2007 by 
roughly 2% annually. The labour force participation 
rate increased to 49½% in mid-2007. These trends 

together led to a stable unemployment rate of just 
below 10%.  
The current account deficit stabilised Œ partly 
reflecting falling domestic demand in the first half of 

the year Œ at just below 8%. FDI inflows increased, 
and covered about two thirds of the current account 
deficit in the first half of 2007. 
Prospects in 2008 to 2009 
The overall picture for the forecasting period looks 
rather favourable. Turkey should be able to increase 
export growth in particular 
in tourism while the 
monetary and fiscal policy 
mix will support the 
disinflation process. A gr
adual decline in inflationary 
pressures will allow a fall in interest rates and 

improve the investment climate. Overall, economic 
activity is expected to rise gradually from about 5% in 
2007 to 6½% in 2009. Output growth is expected to 

be increasingly balanced, with private consumption 
and equipment investment 
growth mitigating lower 
public consumption and construction growth.  
As inflation declines, growth of disposable income 
will accelerate, which allows the private sector to 
increase consumption growth from 3 in 2007 to 5½% 
in 2009. Fixed investm
ent will fall slightly as it 
continues to benefit from reduced macroeconomic and 
political uncertainty and de
clining real interest rates.  
On the other hand, the build-up of stocks is slowing 
down. Strong investment and higher consumption 
growth will lead to continued high growth of imports, 
in particular of consumer durables and capital goods. 

Exports are buoyant 
and are benefiting from 
diversification and quality im
provements resulting 
from earlier high investments.  
Growth of imports will remain strong, partially 
reflecting a rather high import content of exports. In 
2008-2009 exports will 
gradually start benefiting from a weaker currency. The current account deficit is 

therefore projected to grow moderately, from 8% of 
GDP in 2007 to 9% of GDP in 2009. A higher surplus 
of the services balance should
 contribute to maintain 
positive medium-term pros
pects in the external sector. Labour market, costs and prices 
In line with economic expansion, employment is 
forecast to increase by about 1½% per year. This will 
lead to a gradual reduction 
of the unemployment rate 
from 10% in 2007 to 9% in 2009.The trend in 
declining inflationary pressures 
is likely to continue 
as from 2007. Fiscal disci
pline and the increasing 
credibility of the Central 
Bank™s disinflation targets 
are important elements in this respect. 12-month 

consumer price inflation is 
expected to fall below 6% 
by the end of 2008 and 
to 4½% at the end of 2009.

  However, high oil and fo
od prices might slow down 
the disinflation process.  
Public finances  
In the first half of the election 
year 2007, fiscal policy 
was loosened significantly. However, corrective 

measures are under way, and a primary surplus of 5% 
of GDP is likely to be 
achieved in 2006. This still substantial surplus and strong GDP growth led to a 
reduction in the debt ratio, 
from 60½% of GDP at the 
end of 2006 to 54% at the end of 2007. General 
government interest payments have fallen from about 

17% of GDP in 2003 to 7% of GDP in 2007. In 
addition, public sector balances will be affected by 
higher interest rates, higher public spending and a 

slowdown in privatisati
on. Conversely, the ongoing 
public finance reforms will help
 to widen the tax base 
and to increase the efficiency of tax collection. Non-

interest expenditures are seen to remain largely 
constant relative to GDP. The 
general government 
balance is expected to change from a surplus of ½% 
of GDP in 2006 to a deficit 
of 1% of GDP in 2007. In 
2008 and 2009, a 
budgetary surplus
 of respectively 
¼% of GDP and 1¼ is projected as a result of gradual 

fiscal tightening and falling interest rates.  General government debt is
 expected to further 
decline gradually, albeit at a decelerating pace, to less 
than 50% in 2009. The government has been making 

progress in lengthening the average maturity and 
swapping foreign denominated 
into lira-denominated 
debt. However, Turkey pays relatively high interest 

rates on its debt, which highlights its relative high 
vulnerability to interest 
and exchange-rate volatility and rollover risk as the average maturity of its 

domestic debt remains relatively short.

USA - House building down - net exports up
Forecast
Moderate growth in 2007 despite housing recession 
The US economy is expanding at a moderate rate in 
2007. GDP growth was 1.9% higher in the second 
quarter in year-on-year terms. The exceptional 

weakness in the housing sector has so far remained 
relatively contained with little 
spillover to consumer 
spending. However, the crisis in the sub-prime 

mortgage market and the recent turmoil in credit and 
money markets have the potential to restrain 
economic growth further. 
The slide in residential construction explains most of 
the downshift in economic 
growth to below potential. 
It has subtracted 1 pp. from GDP growth over the past 
four quarters. There was some offset from booming 

non-residential construction and improving net 
exports, but equipment investment decelerated to a 
relatively subdued pace. The main support for 

economic activity over the past year was continued 
solid growth in consumer spending at close to 3%. 
According to the latest revision of national account 

data, this was exclusively based on gains in 
disposable personal income and was not supported by 
a fall in the personal saving rate as in previous years. 
The labour market is softening this year with the 
unemployment rate edging up from a cyclical low of 
4.4% in March. At the same time, inflationary 

pressures are receding with the year-on-year increase 
in the price index of core personal consumption 
expenditure falling below 2%. The trade deficit is 

declining against the backgro
und of a weaker dollar, 
rapid economic growth in many export markets and 
slower domestic growth. Export volumes were 6.8% 
higher year-on-year in the first half of 2007 compared 
to only 2.5% for import volumes. As a consequence 
of the improving trade performance, the current 

account deficit declined from 6.1% of GDP (in 
national account terms) in 200
6 to 5.4% in the first 
half of 2007. The fiscal 
deficit of general government 
fell to 2.6% of GDP in 2006, 
but has not declined any 
further. 
The housing slump will depress consumption –.. The correction in the housing ma
rket is turning out to be more pronounced and more protracted than 

expected. An already sharp downward trend in 
housing demand has been aggravated by the recent 
deterioration in financ
ing conditions. Forward-
looking indicators of housing 
demand point to further 
weakness in the near term. The forecast now projects 
that residential construction 
will continue to decline 
into the third quarter of ne
xt year. This will subtract 
0.6 pp. from annual GDP grow
th in 2008. 
In addition, 
the spillover to the broader economy is expected to 

become significant. Average house prices have started 
to fall on a year-on-year basis by some measures. A 
15-20% decline over two ye
ars seems quite plausible 
considering the unusua
lly large overhang of unoccupied housing. The resulting wealth effect on 

households, in combination with stagnating 
employment, is projected to lower consumer spending 
growth to 1.3% in 2008. Furthermore, non-residential 

construction can be expected
 to moderate significantly 
over the next two years an
d equipment investment 
should remain subdued. 
–. but net exports will support GDP growth. 
On the positive side, net 
exports are expected to offset 
a significant part of the weakness in domestic 
demand. Already this 
year, net exports are 
contributing to GDP growth for the first time since 

1995. In the next two years, this contribution is 
projected to increase to 0.6-0.7 pp. The ongoing 
reallocation of productive resources from housing to 

tradables is shown in Graph 5.1.1. 
In a context of moderating
 inflationary pressures, the 
Federal Reserve is likely to counter the expected 
slowing in economic activit
y with further cuts in 
short-term interest rates. This sh
ould help economic 
activity to pick up speed from the second half of 2008 

onwards.

Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
The US economy is still likely to register annual GDP 
growth of 2.1% in 2007, although the final quarter is 
projected to be weaker due to declining consumer 

spending growth. In the first
 half of 2008, annualised 
GDP growth is projected to 
fall to close to 1%. 
Subsequently, when the drag 
from falling residential 
construction subsides, GDP growth will start to 
recover. The upturn will be 
slow at first, but in 2009 
quarterly growth rates should exceed long-term 

potential. Consumer spending 
is projected to remain 
relatively depressed throughout the forecasting period 
in a lagged reaction to lower house prices. Annual 

GDP growth is projected to 
fall to 1.7% in 2008 
before recovering to 2.6% in 2009. 
Unemployment, on a quarterly basis, is projected to 
rise to 5.5% by the end of next year before falling 

back slightly in 2009. In 
view of more slack in overall 
resource utilisation, overall consumer price inflation 
is expected to recede to 1.5% year-on-year in 2009. 
Household saving as a share of disposable income is 
projected to rise by 1.3 pps. over the next two years. 
The balance of payments will improve further with 

the current account deficit falling into the range of 4-
5% of GDP. The fiscal de
ficit of general government, 
on the other hand, will again exceed 3% of GDP as 

tax revenues decelerate. 
The significant downward adju
stment relative to the 
spring forecast of projected growth for 2008 is largely 
a consequence of the worsened outlook for the 

housing sector. Downside risks to growth from this 
part of the economy remain, particularly because the 
fall-out from the recent housing-related financial 

turmoil may turn out worse than currently expected. 
Moreover, there are continued downside risks 
associated with the large current account deficit and a 

possible disruptive adjustment. But there are also 
upside risks, in particular 
from the foreign trade side. 
The recent gain in international competitiveness might 

boost net exports even more than projected which 
would provide an additional
 contribution to growth.

Japan - Employment, consumption and GDP     
An erratic growth pattern in 2007 After posting a robust 2.2% 
GDP growth rate in 2006, 
the Japanese economy experienced a new temporary 
soft patch, with a 1.2% quarter-on-quarter annualised 

GDP contraction in the se
cond quarter
 of 2007. 
However, this bad performance can be seen as a 
compensation of the very strong GDP growth 

recorded in the two preceding quarters, namely 
(+5.6% and +3.0%) and, on average, the economic 
situation remains generally sound with GDP growth 

still around potential in 
the first half of 2007. 
In the first quarter of the year, household consumption 
turned out to be unexpected
ly dynamic before slowing 
down in the following quarter. After four years of 

very strong expansion, business investment has 
contracted during the first two quarters of 2007. As a 
result, Japanese import growt
h remained contained in 
the first half of 2007 
while export growth (in 
particular in the first quarter) showed an impressive 
dynamism, reflecting, notably, the resilience of Asian 

economies (especially non-China Asia). Therefore, 
while the Japanese expansion had been broadening 
beyond the export-related sector over the past years, 
net exports continued contri
buting to almost half of 
the GDP expansion in the first half of the year. 
Recent indicators suggest that the economic 
expansion will continue to 
show some sluggishness 
until the beginning of
 next year. The political 
turbulence and the pension mess Œ in which the 

government lost the records of around 50 million 
pensioners Œ have probably contributed to the decline 
in consumer confidence. As a result, household 
consumption growth is forec
ast to be subdued, albeit 
positive, until the end of
 the year. The September 
Tankan survey 
showed high business confidence, in 
particular among large manufacturers, but there are 
some growing concerns about small and medium-
sized enterprises that face deteriorating conditions 

(especially in terms of squ
eezed profit margins). The 
recent turmoil in financial markets and the related 
possibility of a rapid unwinding
 of carry trades (and 
of a sharp appreciation of th
e yen) have also tilted the 
balance of risks to the Japanese near-term economic 
outlook to the downside.  
Prospects for 2008 and 2009 
Looking ahead, the fundamentals of the Japanese 
economy are favourable overall and suggest that the 
Japanese expansion will 
remain on track. Until now, 
the strengthening of the labour market (the 

unemployment rate has be
en steadily declining from 
an average of 5.2% in 2003 to 3.8% in August) has 
failed to translate into hi
gher employee compensation. 
This disappointing outcome is mainly explained by 
the increasing number
 of highly paid baby-boomers' 
retiring and being replaced by lower-paid young 
employees and by the increasing recruitment of part-
time workers, whose pa
y is on average well below 
that of full-timers. The demographic effect (of the 
retirement and replacement of the baby-boomers) is 
expected to be less significa
nt in 2008. Firm business 
activity and current labour shortages are thus forecast 
to yield higher wage growth. This should be 
supportive to consumer demand. On the corporate 

front, once the current uncertainties dissipate, 
business investment is fore
cast to pick up again, 
supported by favourable ex
ternal demand conditions, 
in particular from the rest of Asia, a sound financial 
situation (due in particular 
to historically high profits) 
and the end of the inventory-cycle adjustment. The 

external environment should also remain growth-
friendly: net exports 
are expected to contribute 
positively to GDP growth alt
hough this contribution 
will gradually decline as impor
t growth speeds up in 
line with the acceleration of domestic demand. All in 
all, GDP growth is forecast to decelerate towards 
1.9% in 2007 and 2008 before reaccelerating to 2.3% 
in 2009. Price and monetary developments

prompted the Bank of Japan to postpone the policy 
rate hike that was expected la
st August. In September, 
the BoJ's core CPI (excluding fresh food only) 

remained unchanged at -0.1% year-on-year while the 
headline index
 declined by -0.2% year-on-year. The 
core CPI (excluding food and energy) also remained 

in negative territory at -0.3% year-on-year. In this 
environment, market particip
ants expect that the policy rate will, at the earliest, be raised at the turn of 

the year. However, 
although domestic objectives must 
prevail, the Bank of Japan should continue to monitor 
the external implications
 of its ultra-loose monetary 
stance and, at some point, some normalisation will 
have to be implemented. 
Government finances have yet to be put on a 
sustainable path Thanks to cyclical revenue bu
oyancy (in particular 
through corporate taxes) and sustained expenditure 
cuts, noteworthy progress has 
been recorded in the 
past fiscal year. The primary deficit for the general 
government (excluding social security) is thus 
projected to decline to about 1% of GDP in FY2007 
from over 5% four years ago but the debt-to-GDP 

ratio remains unsustainab
le and the Japanese 
authorities' medium-ter
m fiscal consolidation 
programme is still not amb
itious enough. The plan 
was presented in July 20
06 and is designed in two 
stages: first, to achieve a primary 
surplus (excluding social security) by FY2011, then to
 reduce the debt-
to-GDP ratio by the mi
d-2010s. FY2006's over-
performance implies only fu
rther modest adjustment 
requirements to reach th
e first goal in 2011. 
Moreover, achieving a primary surplus will not be 
sufficient to stabilise the 
debt-to-GDP ratio and some 
new tax initiatives should be envisaged in order to 
increase fiscal revenues. The debate about the 
possibility of increasing tax revenues (in particular 
through a comprehensive tax reform and a higher 

consumption tax rate Œ curren
tly at 5%) is about to 
start, but the recent election reversals for the ruling 
coalition may make it more di
fficult to push ahead 
with fiscal consolidation.

Economic growth remained very strong in the first 
half of 2007 
After a (revised) growth ra
te of 11.1% in 2006, GDP 
growth accelerated to 11.5% YoY in the first half of 

2007. As in the past, the key factors behind this 
higher-than-expected gr
owth were net merchandise 
exports and a reacceleration of investment in fixed 

assets (still accounting for 
almost 50% of overall 
GDP). Driven by rising per ca
pita disposable income, 
private consumption growth also accelerated to 16.4% 

year-on-year in July. The growth rate of investm
ent and industrial 
production, which had slowed somewhat in the 
second half of 2006 in 
response to policy actions to 
curb investment, reaccelerated again in the first six 
months of 2007. GDP growth
 in the third quarter also 
reached 11.5% YoY, underlining the strength of the 

Chinese economy. Therefore, the current forecast of a 
growth rate of 11.2% for 2007 as a whole already 
implies a significant deceleration in the remaining 

months of this year. 
Inflation accelerating– Inflation, which had been benign in 2006 (average 
CIP rise by 1.5% year-on-year) accelerated to 2.7% 

year-on-year in February 2007 and to 6.2% in 
September, primarily due to a rise in food prices by 
around 18% on the year. Against this background and 

in the run-up to the 
Party Congress this October, the 
central government announced a price freeze for all 
goods and services and direct government control up 
to the end of the year. Inflation for the year 2007 as a 
whole, however, is still likely 
to be around 4.5%.  
With the renminbi (RMB) expected to appreciate 
further and slightly faster than so far and food prices 
normalising again, the rate 
of inflation in 2008 and 
2009 is projected to decelerate again, in spite of 
continuous growth of around
 10%, higher property 
prices, further hikes in administered energy and public 

utility prices, and higher raw material and production 
costs. Monetary tightening 
Partially in response to a higher-than-targeted 
expansion in money supply 
and the considerable rise 
in consumer prices, the
 People™s Bank of China has 
taken various measures since mid-2006 to tighten 
monetary policy, including moral 
suasion on banks to 
strictly control credit flows to the overly invested 
sectors, seven increases in the benchmark lending rate 
(to 7.29% as of 15 September), and eleven increases 

in the reserve requiremen
t ratio (to 13% effective as 
of 25 October). Against the background of ongoing 
strong growth performa
nce, further tightening 
measures by the Central Bank are to be expected. 
Trade and current account surpluses 
According to Chinese custo
ms data, exports in 
September were up by 22.8% year-on-year. With 

imports rising somewhat less rapidly, the trade 
surplus reached USD 
23.91 billion in September 
alone, bringing the trade surplus for the first nine 

months of 2007 to USD 185.6
5 billion (up by 69% on 
the year).  Therefore, it seems ever more likely that 
the 2007 trade surplus will considerably exceed USD 

250 billion and the current account surplus could even 
come close to 10.5% of GDP, with current forecasts 
for 2008 both for the trade and for current account 

surplus even higher in 
absolute term
s. The increase in foreign exchange reserves obser
ved in the last four 
years Œ reserves up from USD 291 billion end-2002 to 

USD 1.3326 trillion end-June 2007 (excluding around 
USD 140 billion held in Hong Kong) Œ is therefore 
likely to continue, perhaps somewhat mitigated by 

growing investment abroad in the framework of the 
Qualified Domestic Institutiona
l Investment scheme 
or through the newly created sovereign wealth fund.

 were substantially higher (up by 30.6% on the year), 
reaching RMB 2.6 trillion. With fiscal expenditures 
up by 22.7% to RMB 1.8 trillion, the fiscal surplus 

reached RMB 819.8 billion, up by RMB 279.3 billion 
compared to the same period of 2006. These figures 
compare to a 2007 budget which Œ based on a real 

growth rate of 8% and a forecast for the CPI of 3% - 
expected an increase in total rev
enues (by all levels of government) of 12% and 
a rise in total expenditures 
of 15.7%, leaving a general government deficit of 
RMB 245 billion or 1.1% of GDP. On the basis of 
figures for the first half of th
is year, however, it seems  
likely that China will come 
very close to a balanced 
general government budget in the current year. 
Growth outlook for 2008 and 2009 
China's growth is expected to ease slightly to 10.3% 
in 2008 and 9.9% in
 2009, reflecting earlier policy 
measures to rein in investm
ent growth, likely further tightening moves and the expected deceleration in 
world trade growth.  Ho
wever, net exports would 
remain an important source for growth. 
With China's trade growth projected to remain 
relatively strong in 2008 and 2009, both trade and 

current account surplus are likely to rise further to 
unprecedented levels.  
The balance of risks is very even, with domestic 
factors (liquidity of enterpr
ises and pent-up demand in 
consumption and housing) poin
ting to an even higher 
growth rate, while the international environment and 
in particular developmen
ts in the United States entail 
downside risks.

    in 2006. The sources for all tables are the Commission services, 
    unless otherwise stated. 10. Geographical zones are defined as follows :

    Historical data for the Member States are based on the European       Euro area : 

    System of Accounting (ESA 1995). Most Member States have now               EUR15 (BE,DE,IE,EL,ES,FR,IT,CY,LU,MT,NL,AT,PT,SI
,FI)    introduced chain-linking in their national accounts to measure the 
    development of economic aggregates in volume terms.       Candidate countries : 

    For the USA and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.               Croatia, Turkey and former Yugoslav Republic of Mace

              Switzerland, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.
4. In Table 16, the data are based on the national index for USA and               

    Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 1996.      MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
              Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential               Lebanon, Lybia, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
 Arabia, Syria,
    output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in              Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.

    the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment
    and the NAWRU play a key role.       Asia :
               All countries except Japan and the Asian MENA countries.
6. Employment data used in tables 21-25, 27 and 31-32 are based on 

    full-time-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Germany,       Latin America :
    Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Estonia,               All countries.
    Hungary and Austria report FTE data (taken together, these countries 

    represent 90% of euro-area GDP and 65% of EU GDP).  In the      Sub-Saharan Africa : 
    absence of FTE data, employment is based on numbers of persons.              All countries except the African MENA countrie
s.    In the calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates, priority is given to
    FTE data, as this is regarded as more representative of diverse

    patterns of working time.
7. The nominal short term interest rates are defined as the 3-month
    inter-bank rates. The nominal long term interest rates are defined
    as the yield on the central government benchmark 10-year bond. 

 8. EU27 and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. 
    World GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS).
    In the tables on world trade and international payments, the

    aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates.
    Tables 48 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU27 and euro-area "adjusted" 
    balances. Theoretically, balances of EU27 and euro area vis-à-vis
    third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of the

    individual countries in the EU27 or  the euro area.

    However, intra-EU27 or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero 
    because of reporting errors.
