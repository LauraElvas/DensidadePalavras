Interim forecast, September 2007   
 
 Economic growth revised slightly in 2007, with downside risks increasing The European economies started 2007 on a 
strong note with GDP expanding by 0.7% 
quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in both the euro 

area and the EU, driven, above all, by 

buoyant investment. Real GDP growth eased 

to 0.3% q-o-q in Q2 in the euro area (0.5% in 

the EU), in contrast to survey data still 

pointing to robust growth. 
A rapid re-pricing of risk following problems 
originating in the US sub-prime mortgage 
market triggered a crisis in the financial 

markets this summer. The global economy 

was generally sound ahead of the recent 

turbulence and, thus, in a relatively good 
position to weather the current turmoil, at 
least if it proves to be short-lived. Albeit 

Central Banks intervention to inject liquidity 

has helped to stabilise the market, the turmoil 

has tilted the balance of risks clearly to the 
downside. This is particularly the case for the 
US, where housing demand fell sharply. 
Against this background, the update of the 
outlook for the seven largest EU economies 

indicates that, although activity will be 

revised down slightly in the third and fourth 

quarter for the euro a
rea and in Q4 for the 
EU, the positive outlook for the EU from the 
spring forecast is largely maintained. This 
follows from several factors: first, the global 

environment remains relatively supportive; 

second, even if survey data weakened 

somewhat, they remain at high levels 
mirroring generally sound fundamentals; 
third, the favourable developments in the 

labour  markets   are   expected   to   underpin 
private consumption.  Overall, GDP growth is revised down 
marginally to 2.5% in the euro area and 2.8% 

in the EU this year (-0.1 pp. compared to the 
spring forecast). This reflects the weaker-
than-expected Q2 and the downward 

revisions of Q3 and Q4, partly offset by the 

impact of a somewhat stronger-than-expected 
Q1. In August, euro-area consumer price 
inflation remained below the 2% threshold 
for the twelfth month in a row.  A strong 

increase in oil prices in 2006 caused 

favourable base effects this year. They are 

one of the main factors behind the limited rise 

in HICP so far in 2007. On the other hand, 
core inflation has increased somewhat, 
reflecting e.g. the impact of the German VAT 

hike. Looking ahead, the projections for 

HICP inflation in 2007 have been revised 

upwards by about 0.1 pp. in both areas to 
2.0% in the euro area and 2.2% in the EU. 
However, this revision is only visible in the 

updated outlook for the euro area due to 

rounding effects. It follows mainly from the 

higher-than-expected inflation in Q2 and the 
projected impact of rising commodity prices. 
 
 
 The EU economies started 2007 on a strong note 
The euro-area and the EU economies entered 2007 
on a sound note, with GDP expanding by 0.7% 
quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in the first quarter. 
Investment provided the main contribution to the 

expansion, reflecting high levels of capacity 
utilisation, still favourable financing conditions, 
healthy corporate profits and an overall positive 

outlook. Companies also increased stocks 
significantly, having depleted inventory levels in 
the last quarter of 2006,
 especially in Germany 
where budgetary measures caused a front-loading 
of demand that caused an exceptionally strong run-
down of inventories in Q4 2006.  
In contrast to survey data, which pointed to 
continued robust growth in the second quarter, real 
GDP growth eased to 0.5% q-o-q in the EU and to 
0.3% in the euro area. The disappointing 
performance of the euro area (compared to the 
projected 0.6%) is the result of a number of 

downward surprises coming from some Member 
States: especially France, 
Italy and the Netherlands.

 The second-quarter growth should be interpreted 
with some caution. The figu
res were affected by the 
impact of the unusually mild winter weather in Q1 

on construction investment, reversed subsequently 
by harsher weather causing a marked downturn in 
Q2. However, they could al
so reflect the fact that 
the cycle has turned, a development, which could 
be reinforced by the impact of the recent turmoil in 
the financial markets. In a
ny event, the peak of the 
cycle appears to be behind us. 
The contribution of domestic demand to GDP 
growth was reduced by investment spending, which 
contracted for the first time
 in five years (see Graph 
1). The rebound of private consumption is, on the 
other hand, an encouraging sign, as in the spring 
forecast private consumption was expected to 

gradually take over as the main engine of growth. 
Similarly, net exports provided a slightly positive 
contribution to GDP growth in Q2. 
  Survey indicators weakened somewhat lately, but 
remain at high levels 
Looking ahead, the recent distress in the financial 
markets appears to have had a certain, but relatively 

limited negative impact on business and consumer 
confidence so far. Even th
ough most survey data 
have started to decline, they remain at high levels 

indicating continued firm real GDP growth in 
coming quarters.

EUeuro area
 The upward trend in the European Commission's 
economic confidence indicators appears to have 
come to a halt and started to reverse in most sectors 
in July (Graph 2). In the 
euro area, for instance, the 
sentiment deteriorated in all sectors except in retail 
trade in July/August. Despite this weakening, all 
sectoral confidence indi
cators remain well above 
their long-term averages 
in both the euro area and 
the EU.  
The Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMI) for 
manufacturing and services continue to display 

diverging trends. While in the manufacturing sector 
confidence has been on a gradual downward path 
since the summer of 2006, in
 the services sector it 
is holding up better, although slightly deteriorating 
in August. Nevertheless, both indices remain firmly 
in the zone that indicates expansion. 
Several national survey indicators have also 
declined somewhat in recent months, but remain 
above their historical averages, suggesting GDP 

growth around potential (such as the German IFO 
and Belgian NBB indexes). 
 
 Despite recent turmoil, the global economic 
environment remains relatively favourable 
A widespread and disorderly re-pricing of risk 
triggered turmoil in the financial markets during the 
Interim forecast, September 2007      3summer, causing stock markets to tumble and 
volatility in foreign-exchange markets to surge. The 
turmoil originated in the US sub-prime mortgage 

market. However, due to securitisation creating 
complex financial instruments, the unrest has 
spread much wider. In money markets, a lack of 

confidence in counterparties drove up money 
market rates. While Central Banks intervened at 
several occasions, conditions in money markets 

have not yet normalised. 3-month inter-bank 
lending rates continue to be at elevated levels and 
the overnight inter-bank lending rate reached a six-
year high in early September, reflecting ongoing 
difficulties for banks to raise funds. Given the 

persistence of underlying confidence problems, 
markets display a high degree of risk aversion and 
are still operating far from normal.  
As investors rushed to lo
w-risk assets, long-term 
government bond yields declined by some 0.4 pp. 
in the US and 0.2 pp. in the euro area, while 
corporate bond spreads rose by around 0.5 pp. 

Although the markets recovered towards the end of 
August, stock market indices are down by around 
5% compared to their highs in mid-July, but still 

significantly higher than a year earlier, see Graph 3. 
The turmoil took place agai
nst the backdrop of a 
continuously strong, though somewhat moderating 
pace of expansion in th
e world economy. The 
economies should thus be in a relatively good 
position to weather the turbulence, at least if the 
disruption remains short-lived.   
Any lasting impact of the turmoil on the global 
economy will crucially depend on the time it takes 
for the markets to revert to an orderly functioning, 

the degree of re-pricing of risks and tightening of 
credit conditions that will persist after the 
turbulence, and whether consumer and investor 

confidence will be negatively affected by the 
developments in the financial markets.  
It is clearly too early to quantify the possible impact 
on the global economy. Almost
 all of the hard data 
refer to the period before the distress in the 
financial markets and the effect on soft data 
appears, so far, limited. However, the turmoil has 

clearly tilted the balance of risks to the downside, 
not only for the global outlook, but also for that of 
the EU and the euro area.

 At present, the global economy is expected to grow 
somewhat faster in 2007 th
an forecast in the spring. 
This may appear surprising considering the 

financial turmoil, but follows from the stronger 
growth in emerging markets that more than offsets 
the downward revision of US growth. World GDP 

growth (excl. EU) is expected to amount to 5¾% 
this year, adding a fifth year of a very growth-
supportive international environment.  
In the 
US, leading indicators point to a deeper and 
longer-lasting correction of the housing sector than 
expected earlier (further reinforced by the 
developments in the financial markets), although 

for the annual growth outl
ook this year, the impact 
is reduced by the rebound in real GDP growth in 
Q2. A worsened outlook 
for private consumption 
and residential investment in the second half of 
2007 would, together with the impact of a reduced 
carry-over from 2006, limit overall GDP growth to 

just below 2%.  
The outlook for 
Japan 
remains broadly unchanged 
for 2007. Although second-quarter growth showed 

an unexpected decline, this
 was partly compensated 
by a relatively strong first quarter. The Japanese 
economy continues to benefit from firm demand in 

Asia, which offsets the temporary soft patch in 
private domestic demand growth.  
In China,
 GDP growth has surprised on the upside, 
yet again. Both fixed investment and exports have 

continued to outperform ex
pectations and real GDP 
growth amounted to 11.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 
the first half of 2007.

 The impact of the turbulence on the financial 
market also appears contai
ned, with the Shanghai 
Stock Exchange increasing and the Central Bank 

raising its main interest rate on 21 August in its 
combat against fast-rising consumer and asset 
prices. Following a slight deceleration towards the 

end of the year, real GDP 
growth is expected at 
more than 11% for the year as a whole. 
After a peak in July of almost 78 US dollar/barrel, 
oil prices
 declined in August, but have now 
stabilised in the 70-75 US dollar/barrel range. A 
general retreat from risky 
assets amidst increased 
financial market volatility coupled with concerns 
about the ongoing weakne
ss of the US economy 
and its implications for oil demand were the main 

factors behind the decline in prices.  
However, oil prices still remain at an elevated level, 
reflecting the tight situation in the oil market and 
continued risks for supply disruptions in important 

oil exporting countries, such as Iraq, Iran and 
Nigeria. According to the futures market, oil prices 
are assumed to amount to 68 US dollar/barrel in 

2007 (i.e. up by 1¾ US dollar/barrel compared to 
the spring outlook).   
The appreciation of the
 euro
 accelerated during the 
early summer and the euro reached a record high 

against the US dollar (at 1.38 on 24 July) and the 
yen (at 168.68 on 13 July). However, the foreign-
exchange markets have thereafter also been affected 

by the turbulence as risk aversion rose. This caused 
an unwinding of carry trades and the Japanese yen 
appreciated by about 8% 
against the euro. The US 
dollar also appreciated, reflecting e.g. an increased 
awareness of euro-area banks' exposure to the US 
sub-prime mortgage market.  
When markets calmed down somewhat in the 
second half of August, some of these trends were 
partly reverted. Based on the assumption of 
constant nominal exchange rates for the remainder 

of the year, the bilateral USD/EUR would (at 1.35 
USD/EUR) remain largely unchanged from the 
spring forecast, implying an appreciation of the 

nominal effective exchange rate of 2.6%.  
Following several years of exceptionally favourable 
financing conditions
, the tightening of monetary 
and financial conditions have been reinforced by 
the recent crisis. In view of unusually low risk 
spreads in past years, a general re-pricing of risk 

has been expected. But as
 the shift in investor 
sentiment took place in an 
abrupt fashion, markets 
were unsettled.  
The tightening became par
ticularly visible in a 
sharp rise of inter-bank lending rates and, to a lesser 
extent, in a correction in equity prices and a rise in 
corporate spreads. The imp
act is partly cushioned 
by a weakening in the euro's effective exchange rate 
and a decline in long-term interest rates. Following 
market expectations, futures contracts have only 

priced in a low probability of a further interest-rate 
hike. In the present situation, expectations derived 
from market instruments re
flect to a certain degree 
also liquidity conditions and need to be interpreted 
with caution. Renewed volatility can furthermore 
not be excluded. However, based on current market 
expectations, short and long
-term interest rates are 
only slightly higher than assumed in the spring 

forecast this year (up by 0.1-0.2 pp.).   
  Positive outlook largely maintained for 2007 
Based on the individual updates for Germany, 
Spain, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Poland and 
the United Kingdom (which are presented in greater 

detail in the country-specific sections below), GDP 
growth in the euro area is set to rebound in the third 
quarter of 2007 to 0.5% q-o-q. However, it should 

be stressed that uncertainty is unusually large as 
regards the second half of this year, especially for 
Interim forecast, September 2007      5Q4, when the impact of the turmoil in the financial 
market could influence conf
idence and growth to a 
greater extent, which, in turn, could imply a more 

marked deceleration in 2008. 
Based on currently available information, the 
update for the euro-area aggregate points to a 
growth rate of 0.5% q-o-q in both Q3 and Q4 

implying a downward revision of 0.1 pp. each 
quarter compared to the fully-fledged spring 
forecast. Reflecting the more gradual moderation of 

the UK outlook, the EU is expected to grow by 
0.6% q-o-q in Q3 and 0.5% in Q4 (i.e. revision of 
the outlook for Q4 only). As a consequence of this 
and, in particular, th
e weaker-than-expected 
outcome for Q2, annual GDP growth is revised 

downwards by 0.1 pp. in both areas as compared to 
the spring forecast, to 2.
5% for the euro area and 
2.8% for the EU.  
Domestic demand is expected to continue to be the 
main contributor to GDP growth in both the euro 
area and the EU, with output set to be increasingly 
driven by private consumption. This reflects 
inter 
alia
 the persistent signs of improvement in the 
European labour markets,
 not least in Germany. 
The unemployment rate fell below 7% in both the 

EU and the euro area during the summer, a level 
not seen since the early 1980s. Consumer 
confidence remains, at least so far, well above its 

long-term average, even 
if a certain decline has 
been noted in recent months.  
Judging from the European Commission's 
investment survey, investment volumes in the 
manufacturing sector are expected to remain 
buoyant, although it should be noted that this 

survey stems from June 2007.  
Looking further ahead, the updated outlook for 
2007 (i.e. the downward revision of the third and 
fourth quarters for the euro area (Q4 for the EU) 

and the annual outlook by 0.1 pp. in both areas) 
points to a somewhat reduced growth momentum in 
2008. In addition, the possible impact of the distress 

in the financial markets is likely to affect the 
coming year, notably through a tightening of credit 
conditions across the board.  
The impact of the lower carry-over from 2007 and 
the re-pricing of risks would need to be carefully 
assessed against other changes in the global 
environment. On current e
xpectations, for instance, 
the slowdown in the US economy is expected to be 
more pronounced, but relatively short-lived. In the 

course of next year, US GDP growth is projected to 
return to its long-term trend. However, a deeper and 
more long-lasting correction in the housing market 

can not be excluded. The next fully-fledged forecast 
by the Commission, due in early November, will 
provide a more detailed assessment of these issues. 
  
Inflation remained contained in the first half of 
2007 due to favourable base effects 
Consumer price inflation was 1.9% in the first half 
of 2007 in the euro area, broadly in line with the 

spring forecast for 2007 and declining from the 
previous year. It was 2.2% the EU, slightly higher 
than foreseen in the spring forecast, but still 

relatively contained compared with 2006. At 1.8% 
in August headline inflation in the euro area was 
running below the 2% threshold for the twelfth 

consecutive month. As oil prices rose strongly 
during summer 2006, peaking in early August, 
favourable base effects in energy prices largely 

account for the limited incr
ease in (y-o-y) energy 
inflation in recent months.  
In contrast, core inflation increased by 0.3 pp. 
between December 2006 and July 2007. This up-

tick seems mostly related to the VAT increase in 
Germany. Indeed, excl
uding energy prices, 
producer price inflation (which excludes VAT) 
remained broadly unchanged between December 
2006 and July 2007. This 
took place in a context of 
decelerating demand compared to the second half 
of 2006. On the other hand, although employment 
continued to grow at a h
ealthy pace, pressure from 
wage developments still appeared limited.

HICP inflation
core inflation (HICP excl. energy and unprocessed food)
(y-o-y % changes)
  Some upward pressures continued to develop in the 
price of services in the 
first half of 2007. These 
were, however, compensated for by muted 
developments in energy prices. Meanwhile, 
developments in prices of unprocessed food crept 

up slowly. Moreover, indust
rial price pressures at 
the producer level remained moderate in the first 
half of 2007 (rising by around 2½ % on average, 

after 5% in 2006). Nevertheless, some sub-
components suggest that price pressures may still 
be in the pipeline. In addition, money and credit 

growth kept rising at a swif
t pace in July, the fastest 
since the introduction of the euro in 1999.  
Turning to wage indicators, compensation per 
employee increased by 2.5% in Q1 (up from 1.8% 
in 2006Q4), while total hourly labour costs grew at 
an annual rate of 2.2% in the first quarter of 2007 

(stable from 2006Q4).   
  
Inflation set to increase, to just above 2% 
Looking ahead, the aggregated outlook for inflation 
in 2007 has been revised slightly upwards, based on 
upward revisions in some of the updates for the 

largest Member States. HICP inflation is now 
expected to average 2.0% in the euro area and 2.2% 
in the EU this year. This adds about 0.1 pp. to 

consumer price inflation for both areas compared to 
the spring 2007 forecast, although due to rounding 
effects this is only visible as regards the euro area.   
This upward revision is mainly due to higher-than-
expected inflation in Q2 in some countries and a 
more pronounced increase 
towards the end of the 
year in others. The swings 
in energy inflation come 
on top of some pressures on core inflation in an 
economic environment charac
terised by a closing of 
the output gap. The above-trend expansion in 2006 
and early 2007 has significantly reduced the slack 
in the EU economy, driving capacity utilisation 

rates clearly above the late-2000 peak. On the other 
hand, the rise in unit labour costs has remained 
subdued so far thanks to still well-behaved wage 
inflation and significant productivity gains.  
On balance, headline and, 
possibly, core inflation 
are likely to drift slightly higher in the second half 

of 2007 as the favourable 
base effects come to an 
end. Looking further ahead, however, domestic 
inflationary pressures could ease if tighter financing 

conditions start to dampen GDP growth.  
  
Continued improvement in the labour market and 
public finances 
In the first half of 2007, the labour market has 
continued to improve.
 For the euro area, 
employment growth accelerated
 to around 1.5% in 
2006, representing around 2 million new jobs (3 
million in the EU). In the first quarter of 2007, 

employment grew by 0.4% q-o-q in both the euro 
area and the EU and data for Q2 for some Member 
States indicate that employment growth continued 
at a similar pace. Given that employment growth 
typically lags output growth, employment growth 

should, by and large, continue throughout 2007. 
Meanwhile, the euro-area unemployment rate fell 
by around 1 pp. within a year, to 6.9% in July 2007 

(an annual average of 7.3%
), the lowest level in 
more than a decade; it ev
en reached 6.8% in the 
EU. This is attributable to a large extent to the 

strong cyclical upswing at the end of 2006 and the 
beginning of 2007. However, available estimates 
also point to a clear and continuous fall in the 

structural rate of un
employment, currently 
estimated at around 7½
% for the year 2007.  
In line with the still firm GDP growth and inflation 
projections for 2007, labour market developments 
Interim forecast, September 2007      7are expected to remain favourable. This is in line 
with survey data being still above long-term 
averages. In this respect 
it is encouraging to note 
that hiring intentions in the services sector, which is 
the largest employer, improved further in August.  
Turning to public finances, the information 
available suggests that, despite the slight downward 

revision of economic activity, government revenues 
in 2007 are likely to be somewhat higher in several 
Member States than expected
 in the spring forecast. 
At the same time, expenditures may be more 
dynamic in some of these countries. As a result, the 
2007 budgetary position fo
r the EU as a whole 
could be close to what was predicted in the spring 
forecast. A full assessment of the prospects for 

public finances will be carried out in the 
Commission's autumn forecast.  
  
Risks to the forecast clearly tilted to the downside 
The spring forecast identified the risks to the 
outlook as being broadly balanced in 2007, but 

tilted to the downside in 2008.  
Developments since then have confirmed a number 
of downside risks for 2007, not least a worsened 
outlook for the US economy and re-pricing of risks 

in the financial markets. In particular, the possible 
impact of the financial market turmoil may affect 
the (global) economy via three channels.  
First, the deterioration in the US housing market 
may trigger a markedly more pronounced 
slowdown in the US. Given the influence of the 
United States economy on the world economy, a 
slowdown in growth in the US will have some 
impact on the rest of the world, in particular in 

Europe. Second, a persistent distress in the financial 
markets may lead to a tightening of financing 
conditions that goes beyond the normalisation of 

the pricing of risk.  
Added to this could be effects from a worsening of 
the balance sheets of companies and households, 
due to a fall in asset prices. Finally, there could be 

an adverse shift in consumer and investor 
confidence.

 These risks, if they materialise, will mainly impact 
on the real economy in 2008 and beyond. However, 
some of these risks could have some effects already 

this year. They would come on top of other risks, 
already identified in the sp
ring forecast, such as 
higher oil prices and changes in exchanges rates.  
Graph 6 provides a quantification of these risks in 
terms of possible deviations of output growth from 
the main scenario. More
 specifically, the graph 
shows the impact various 
combinations of risks 
could have on euro-area GDP growth, the outcomes 
being weighted by the probability of their 
occurrence. At a 90% co
nfidence interval, GDP 
growth in the euro area could be more than 0.3 pp. 
lower in 2007 compared to 
the central scenario if 
all negative factors materialise. But growth could 
also be up to 0.2 pp. higher if the positive risks to 
the outlook were to materialise, which would 

presuppose, in particular
, that calm is quickly 
restored in financial markets and that the expected 
tightening of credit conditions proves transitory.  
Interim forecast, September 2007      8 Growth and inflation prospects in the 
seven largest Member States 
1. Germany Œ temporary factors aside, robust 
underlying growth  
Underlying activity in Germany remains robust, but 
was recently influenced by temporary factors. 
Buoyant growth in 2006, driven also by anticipation 

effects in the forefront of the VAT increase, was 
followed by a corresponding shortfall in demand in 
the first half of 2007. Nevertheless, a significant 
contraction in private consumption in the first 
quarter was dampened by a substantial growth 

contribution from inventories and unusual warm 
weather conditions that provided a temporary boost 
to construction. As a consequence, the negative 

impact of front-loading 
housing investment became 
visible only in the second quarter, with a 
seasonally-adjusted drop of nearly 5%. Growth in 

Q2 remained positive, however, because private 
consumption started to recover moderately and 
investment in machinery and equipment continued 

to provide firm support.

index
 The persistently favourable outlook is backed by 
hard and soft business cycle indicators. Strong 

growth of manufacturing output is outpaced by 
incoming orders, raising order levels even further. 
Firms therefore take an optimistic view on the 

business situation as reflected by the economic 
sentiment indicators. In addition, the continuous 
brightening of the labour market should support a 
further recovery in private consumption. 
The recent turmoil on financial markets has dented 
both consumer and enterprise expectations 

somewhat, although the economic impact is not yet 
clear. So far, only few German banks have been 
affected and a wider banking crisis is not in sight. 

However, risk premia for credits to private 
consumers and enterprises have increased. While a 
stronger effect cannot be ruled out, the limited 

impact of the crisis so fa
r suggests only a marginal 
downward revision of the growth forecast for the 
remaining quarters and the average of the year.  
Price effects of the VAT hike, the introduction of 
university tuition fees in some 
Länder and recently 
higher food prices led to 
an increase in the annual 
inflation rate to 2%. However, under the 
assumption of relatively stable oil prices and wage 
increases being mainly accommodated by 

productivity gains, stronger inflationary pressure is 
not in sight. Thus, from a small up-tick around the 
turn of the year, inflation 
should start to decelerate 
again in the coming quarters. 
 2. Spain Œ growth still firm in 2007 
In Spain, GDP grew by 0.9% in quarterly terms in 
the second quarter of 2007, down from 1.0% in the 
first quarter. For the year as a whole, economic 

activity is anticipated to expand by 3.7%, 
unchanged from the spring forecast.  
In this year, the economy is showing a similar pace 
of growth and growth composition as in 2006, in 
which GDP was exclusively based on domestic 
demand. In spite of a slightly higher-than-projected 

growth during the first semester of 2007, economic 
expansion might be less dynamic during the second 
half of the year, as both
 private consumption and 
investment in construction growth could decelerate 
due to past tightening of monetary conditions and 
weaker wealth effects asso
ciated to both financial 
and real estate assets. Concerning the external 
sector, the most recent available information would 
suggest that Spanish imports continue to outstrip 

exports and, as a result, 
the negative contribution of 
net exports to GDP growth would not depart 
significantly from 1 percentage point in 2007.  
Interim forecast, September 2007      9Inflation declined to 2.4% in the second quarter of 
2007. This is 0.1 percentage point above the spring 
forecast. The inflation diff
erential vis-à-vis the euro 
area has narrowed during the last quarters and, from 
1½ percentage points in summer 2006, it has 
bottomed out at around half of a percentage point 

recently. In spite of a proj
ected rebound of inflation 
at the end of the year on the basis of energy and 
food price developments, 
the average price increase 
for the year as a whole would remain at around 
2.5%.

  3. France Œ sizeable downward revision compared 
to the spring forecast 
The French economy lost momentum in the second 
quarter of 2007, and for the year as a whole GDP 

growth is projected to be 1.9%, close to the rate 
recorded in 2006. This estimate is half point below 
the Commission services' sp
ring forecast and is also 
due to the downward revision of the quarterly GDP 
growth in 2006. The disappointing performance in 

the second quarter of 2007, with GDP increasing by 
only 0.3% q-o-q, largely reflects the unexpected 
stagnation of business investment.  
Concerning the outlook for the remainder of the 
year, the recent financial turmoil is likely to 
discourage firms' investment plans, although 
demand expectations still remain healthy. Private 

consumption could remain the engine of growth, 
with real personal disposable income supported by 
tax cuts introduced with the budget for 2007, 
combined with muted inflation. Even if the 

expansionary effect on annual GDP growth of the 
package of measures introd
uced at the end of the 
summer is expected to be marginal, it is likely to 

boost households' confidence, which has so far 
shown encouraging readings in 2007 and should 
contribute to support both private consumption and 

housing investment in the coming months 
considering that the last outlook for construction is 
still well oriented.  
The latest business surveys reveal that foreign 
demand addressed to France continues to be fairly 
robust. Without repeating the relatively good 

performance of 2006, growth in French exports 
could continue to be relatively sustained (French 
exports increased by 1¼% per quarter in the first 

half of 2007, after a modest growth in 2006Q4). 
However, import growth should stay strong in 
response to the robustness of final demand and, 

thus, the net contribution of the external sector 
should remain negative.

 Inflation in 2007 is expected to turn out at 1.4%, in 
line with the spring for
ecast. Industrial producer 
prices of final consumption goods have been 
subdued, providing evid
ence that second-round 
effects from high raw material prices have been 
contained up to now. On the back of slightly less 
favourable cyclical conditions and considering the 

recovery in employment, unit labour costs are

as measured by the HI
CP excluding food and 
energy prices, should be
 close to 1½%, while 
energy inflation should be
 rather weak this year. 
 4. Italy Œ growth slightly below potential in the 
second half of 2007 
Following a weak real GDP growth in the first 
quarter of 2007, at 0.3% q-o-q, the GDP estimate 

released in August point to a  mere 0.1% quarterly 
increase in Q2. Also reflecting the strong 
acceleration in Q4 2006, the carry-over for real 
GDP growth in 2007 as a wh
ole is at 1.5% after the 
first two quarters. For the 
second half of the year, 
business confidence indicator
s for the services and 
the manufacturing sectors suggest that economic 
activity is likely to record a moderate expansion. 

Quarterly GDP growth is 
forecast at 0.4% in Q3 
and 0.3% in Q4 of 2007, slightly below its 
potential. Economic growth in 2007 as a whole is 

expected to be 1.9%, in line with the spring 
forecast.  Graph 10: Italy - GDP growth and confidence in the

 Private consumption was the main driver of GDP 
growth in the first quarter, despite the slowdown in 
employment growth. Positive indications for the 

services sector and buoyant growth of VAT receipts 
up to the month of August suggest that domestic 
demand will continue being the main driver of 

growth throughout the year. After the strong 
increase recorded in the la
st part of 2006, exports 
have decelerated. However, combined with 
moderate import dynamics, net exports are 

expected to provide a positive contribution to GDP 
growth in 2007. By sector
, the quarterly contraction in industrial production in Q1 and Q2 suggests that 

the contribution of manufacturing to overall GDP 
growth in 2007 will be le
ss sizeable than in 2006. 
In contrast, the services sector is holding up well.  
The forecast for annual HICP
 inflation in 2007 is at 
1.9%, in line with the sp
ring forecast and lower 
than the 2.2% rate in 2006. Besides the lower 
contribution to annual inflation from energy prices, 
the liberalisation measures adopted so far have 
contributed to a deceleration in the HICP, in 

particular through lower telecommunication prices.  
 5. The Netherlands Œ re
bound expected after 
disappointing second quarter 
After two consecutive quarters of strong growth 
(0.7% q-o-q), GDP grew at a disappointing rate of 

0.2% in the second quart
er of 2007. One factor 
explaining the poor growth performance was a 
slowdown in the production of the chemical and 

steel industries. Moreover, whereas in the first 
quarter the unusually mild weather supported 
construction activity, in the second quarter bad 

weather conditions hampered production therein. 
Furthermore, both quarters were adversely affected 
by a 22% reduction in the production of mineral gas 

as compared to the first ha
lf of 2006. However, as 
the underlying growth impetus remains strong, 
GDP growth is expected to regain strength in the 
second half of the year, and annual GDP should 
come out around 2.5% in 2007.

 Continued healthy economic growth prospects will 
put further strain on the already tight labour market. 
The unemployment rate fell from 3.9% on average 
in 2006 to 3.4% in July and, over 2007, is expected 

to average just above 
3%. Although contractual 
wage increases have been relatively modest to date, 
wage drift is expected to 
lead to some upward price 
pressures towards the end of 2007. At the same 
time the global increase in
 agricultural prices is 
expected to start feeding into the HICP. However, 
these upward price pressures are counteracted by a 
low increase in regulated housing rents from the 

second half of the year onwards and a flattening out 
contribution of energy prices to inflation. Total 
HICP is left relatively unaffected and annual 

inflation is thus expected at 1.7% in 2007.
  6. Poland Œ buoyant economic growth 
Economic activity continued to be strong in the 
second quarter of 2007. GDP growth is estimated to 
have reached 1.7% quar
ter-on-quarter, about ½ 
percentage point higher than in the Commission 
services' spring forecas
t. The positive growth 
surprise was due to con
tinued strong gross capital 
formation, and accumulation of
 stocks in particular. 
For 2007 as a whole, GDP 
is expected to grow by 
6½%, which is ½ percentage point higher than in 
the spring forecast. This
 follows from the better-
than-expected result in th
e second quarter of 2007 
and a positive outlook for the remaining part of the 
year, where GDP is expect
ed to grow at around 
1¼% quarter-on-quarter.  
Domestic demand will continue to be the main 
driver of growth, with a key role for robust gross 

fixed capital formation and strong consumption. 
Consumption growth is supported by strong wage 
increases (owing to a tax wedge cut and a 

tightening labour market) and a recovery in the 
labour market. Between the first and second quarter 
of 2007, the employment rate increased by ca. 1.2 

percentage points, while the unemployment rate 
was reduced by nearly 1.7 percentage point to 
9.6%, which means nearly 300 thousand people 
found a job. The improvemen
t is expected to go on, 
albeit at a slower pace, mainly due to emerging skill 

mismatches.

 HICP inflation reached 2.
4% year-on-year in the 
second quarter of 2007, ¼ percentage point higher 
than in the spring 2007 commission services' 
forecast. Strong wage demands, fuelled also by 

labour shortages in certain segments of the market, 
and higher food and fuel prices will put upward 
pressure on inflation. Due also to exchange rate 

developments, the mitigating impact of import 
prices on inflation is assumed to be less important 
than in the recent past. Thus, inflation for 2007 has 

been revised upwards co
mpared to the spring 
forecast from 2.0% to 2.4%.  
Interim forecast, September 2007      12 7. The United Kingdom Œ still robust growth, 
albeit moderating  
In the first half of 2007 economic activity in the UK 
remained strong. In the first and second quarters of 

2007, real GDP grew by 0.7% and 0.8% q-o-q 
respectively and by 3.0% y-o-y in each quarter, 
slightly stronger than 
the Commission services' 
spring 2007 forecast. Domestic demand accounted 
for the entire increase in 
GDP, whereas net exports 
made a small negative contribution to growth in the 

second quarter. Consumer spending remained 
buoyant, accounting for half 
of the increase in GDP 
in each quarter, in part 
due to the resilience of 
housing market activity. However, data on 
disposable income in the first quarter showed a 

drop in the saving ratio from 3.9% in the last 
quarter of 2006 to 2.1%, the lowest for over 40 
years. A sharp drop in fixed investment in the 

second quarter, notwithstanding robust growth in 
business investment, was more than compensated 
for by the positive contribution of inventories.   
GDP growth in 2007 is expected to slow in the 
second half of the year, to 0.7% q-o-q in the third 
quarter and to 0.5% in the final quarter. Survey 
evidence up to August reported steady consumer 

confidence and still buoyant ac
tivity in the services 
sector. Going forward, however, past monetary 
tightening is expected to feed through to lower 

household consumption expenditure and to tighter 
business investment. GDP growth for the entire 
year is forecast to reach 2.
9%, slightly higher than 
that in the preceding year
 and than the Commission 
services' spring 2007 forecast.  

 The year-on-year HICP inflation rate in July 2007 
fell sharply from 2.4% in the previous month to 

1.9%, below the official target of 2% for the first 
time since March 2006. However, the rate of 
inflation is expected to 
increase back to slightly 
more than 2% during the rest of 2007. The recent 
floods in the UK are exp
ected to contribute to 
higher food prices later this year. At the same time, 

oil prices, which had dropped sharply in the second 
half of 2006, are expected 
to exert upward pressure 
on petrol prices. Therefore, average HICP inflation 

in 2007 is expected to be 2.4%, slightly higher than 
forecast in the spring.

   Interim forecast, September 2007      14 Box: Technical background to the interim forecast 
 In February 2006, the Commission presented the first 
of what are now twice-year
ly interim forecasts with 
the objective of updating its comprehensive spring 

and autumn economic forecas
ts (with the next fully-
fledged forecast scheduled for 9 November 2007). 
This interim forecast updates
 the outlook of the spring 
2007 economic forecast of 7 May 
(http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/eu
ropean_economy/forecasts_en.htm
 ). The cut-off date 
for this interim forecast to take new information on 
board was 6 September 2007. 
The interim forecast updates 
the outlook for the seven  
largest Member States (bas
ed on an average of the 
ranking in terms of both population and nominal 
GDP), i.e. France, Germany,
 Italy, the Netherlands, 
Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom, as regards 
real GDP growth and HICP 
inflation for the current 
year. These updates are pr
epared using indicator-
based forecasting models or
 judgemental forecasting 
techniques.  
Estimates for the European Union and the euro area 
are prepared using the nominal GDP-weighted 

updates for the largest Member States. These 
countries account for more than 80% of the European 
Union and almost 85% of the euro area in terms of 

nominal GDP. The outlook for the smaller Member 
States, which have tended to grow faster than the 
larger ones, have not been updated. The Commission 

has made projections for the euro area and the EU 
using the updates for the five and seven largest 
Member States respectively, and assuming that the 
revision for the smaller Member States is equal to that 
of the larger ones. 
Quarterly data are updated with the latest available 
information. When comparing quarterly with annual 
GDP growth it must be kept in mind that, whenever 
possible, quarterly data are adjusted for both seasonal 

influences and the number of working days while 
annual data is presented in unadjusted form. The 
weaker-than-expected quarterly growth rate of GDP 

in 2007Q2 could be reinforced by difficulties with 
working-day adjustment. 
  External conditions  
This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions. These assumptions are based on market 
expectations at the time of 
the forecast. To shield the 
assumptions from possible volatility during one 
specific trading day, averages from a 10-day reference 
period have been used for exchange and interest rates 

as well as for oil prices.  
The technical assumption as
 regards exchange rates 
has been standardised using fixed nominal exchange 
rates for all currencies. They are kept constant based 
on the averages from 22 August to 4 September.  
Interest rates assumptions are, since spring 2007, 
market-based instead of
 expert-based. These 
assumptions should be interpreted with caution, as 
market-based assumptions do not only reflect policy 
rate expectations, but also liquidity conditions in this 

period of market uncertainty. Short-term interest rates 
for the euro area are derive
d from future contracts. 
Long-term interest rates for the euro area, as well as 

short- and long-term interest rates for Poland and the 
UK are calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the spread
 between the 3-month 
interbank interest rate and the 3-month swap-rate. As 
a result, the short-term rate is at 4.3% and the long-
term interest rates at 4.2% on average in 2007 for the 

euro area. 
The outlook for oil prices is based on futures prices. 
The price for a barrel of Bren
t crude oil is projected at 
68.0 USD/barrel in 2007. This would be 1.8 
USD/barrel higher than assumed in the spring 2007 
forecast, reflecting maintained strong demand from 

e.g. emerging markets and geopolitical uncertainties.  
Global demand in 2007 is revised slightly upwards 
(by 0.3 pp.), despite the recent distress in the financial 
markets. A weaker outlook fo
r the US is fully offset 
by stronger growth in emer
ging markets, especially 
China. Real GDP growth for the world (excluding the 
EU-27) is thus forecast to 
remain largely unchanged, 
at 5.7% in 2007 (down from 5.8% in 2006). World 
trade also remains largely unchanged in 2007, with 
growth in export and import volumes of goods 

estimated at around 9% and 8½%, respectively, 
(excluding the EU-27). 
Interim forecast, September 2007
