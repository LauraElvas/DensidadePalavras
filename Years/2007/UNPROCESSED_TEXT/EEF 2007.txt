Overview - 1 - 
The EU and the euro area economies 
performed better than expected in 
2006, thanks to brisk global growth and favourable domestic conditions. 
Moreover, the impact of high oil prices and the slowdown of the US 

economy were relatively muted. Real GDP growth quickened to a rate of 
0.9% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in the fourth quarter in both areas, well 
above estimates of pote
ntial growth. For 2006 as a whole, economic 
activity expanded by 3.0% in the EU and 2.7% in the euro area. This is 
more than 1 percentage point (pp.) above the growth recorded in 2005 and 
somewhat stronger than expected in
 the autumn 2006 economic forecast. 
The expansion was largely driven by domestic demand, especially by a 
marked improvement in investment in equipment. Private consumption 

grew more moderately, as labour markets started to improve considerably. 
Economic activity was also supported by a positive net contribution from 
the external sector. Indeed, the rebound
 in the fourth quarter of 2006 was 
due in part to surging exports. 
Real GDP growth in 2007 
is forecast at 2.9% in the EU and 2.6% in the 
euro area, broadly unchanged compared to 2006. This constitutes an 
upward revision of ½ pp. compared 
to the autumn 2006 
forecast for both 
areas. In 2008, prospects ar
e for a slight deceleration in activity, to 2.7% in 
the EU and 2.5% in the euro area, 
which would still be above potential. 
The international environment is expected to remain supportive. World 
GDP growth (excluding the EU) should ease somewhat from 5.8% in 2006 
to slightly below 5½% over the forecas
t period. This is mainly explained 
by a slowdown in the manufacturing sector at the global level. The outlook 
for the United States is scaled down by the ongoing cooling in the housing 
sector, while prospects for most other regions, notably the emerging 

markets, remain bright. 
In the United States, the economy shifted into lower gear in the course of 
2006. So far, the slowdown has mainly hit the housing sector, with 
residential investment falling by almost 20% annualised in the second half 
of 2006. A correction of inventories, 
especially in the automotive sector, 
also dampened GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2006. On the other 
hand, real consumer spending has held up well on the back of solid wage 
and employment gains and falling energy prices in the second half of the 

year. The downturn in the housing market is likely to continue for a while, 
and, together with a renewed rise in
 energy prices and a weakening labour 
market, will act to slow consumer sp
ending. Real GDP growth is thus 
projected to decline from 3.3% in 2006 to 2.2% in 2007. A gradual 
turnaround in the housing sector should make for a recovery of the 
economy in 2008, which is, however, likely to be relatively shallow. This 

outlook implies that the 
current account deficit, which amounted to around 
6% of GDP in 2006, will change
 little over the forecast period.  
Economic activity in Japan rebounded in the last quarter of 2006 after a 
soft patch in the third quarter. Buoyed by a pick-up in private consumption, 

GDP growth accelerated to 1.3% QoQ 
in the last quarter. Revisions of 
historical GDP data reduced the annual growth rate for 2006 to 2.2%. GDP

growth is forecast to broadly maintain
 this pace over th
e period 2007-2008, implying that the Japanese economy will continue to exceed its estimated 
potential growth rate. Deflation is expected to come to an end, with 

headline inflation flat this year and around ½% in 2008. 
The Chinese economy surprised, yet again, on the upside in 2006, with 
GDP growth accelerating to 10.7%. This
 is explained by continued strong 
exports, but also buoyant investment activity despite the government's 
measures to dampen it. The curren
t account surplus widened further to 
around 9% of GDP. GDP growth is pr
edicted to edge down marginally 
over the forecast period, although staying above 10%. This reflects, above 
all, ongoing tightening measures by the government.  
Among the other emerging regions, economic activity is generally forecast 
to maintain its robust 
pace. Growth in the Middl
e East and North Africa 
should stay at around 5½% this year
, while it should accelerate to 6½% in 
sub-Saharan Africa. On the other hand, economic growth in Latin America 
is expected to decelerate somewhat to
 4½%, partly refl
ecting the slowdown 
in the US economy and a maturing of the recovery in some countries.  
In the candidate countries, output growth
 is projected to decelerate by 1 pp. 
to around 5% in 2007, which is attributable to a deterioration in the outlook 
for the Turkish economy. This follows, in particular, from the impact of 
the financial turbulence in early 2006, which caused a significant rise in 
inflation triggering e.g. higher interest
 rates that, in turn, weakened private 
consumption. The outlook is for a grad
ual, successful disinflation process, 
bringing consumer price inflation below 6½% by the end of this year, and 
a subsequent rebound of economic activity in 2008. 
Spurred by the rapid growth of the world economy, world trade picked up 
to a growth rate of almost 9% last year. However, in the wake of a cooling 
global manufacturing sector, trade growth is projected to slow down to 
7½% this year and to
 some 7¼% in 2008. 
Oil prices fluctuated widely in 2006.
 Following a peak of almost 80 USD 
per barrel for Brent crude in August at the height of the Lebanon war, oil 
prices fell back significantly as the risk of an extended conflict in the 
Middle East receded and pe
rceptions of the global
 outlook turned less 
optimistic. However, as from early 2007 a number of factors caused a 
reversal of the slide in prices, includ
ing a spell of cold(er) winter weather 
in the US, an improved economic outlook globally, an unusually 

disciplined reaction of OPEC in response to the previous fall in prices and 
increasing tensions over Iran's nuclear programme. In April 2007, the oil 
price was trading in the range of USD 65-70 per barrel. Looking ahead, 

accelerating global demand for oil in co
mbination with slow growth of 
supply suggests that the oil market will remain tight. Consequently, oil 
prices are assumed to stay high in the near term, ranging between USD 67 
and 70 per barrel, based on futures prices. This corresponds to an annual 
average of 66.2 in 2007
, i.e. unchanged compared to last year, rising by 
around 6% in 2008 to USD 70.3.

Robust world trade 
Oil prices to stay high 
Overview - 3 - 
Non-fuel commodity prices increased significantly in 2006, by 28% in 
USD terms, reflecting, in particular, high demand for minerals and metals 
amid supply constraints. Average prices are expected to increase a further 

14% this year compared to the aver
age of 2006, due to continued rising 
prices for some agricultural products an
d an overhang from last year's large 
price increases for metals and minerals, before easing marginally in 2008. 
Since 2003, commodity prices have almost doubled (rising by 94%). 
Despite such headwinds, world GDP growth has remained robust, while 

consumer price inflation has remained contained. The predominantly 
demand-driven nature of the rise in commodity prices in combination with 
credible macroeconomic frameworks app
ears to be one of the reasons why 
the impact on the global economy has been relatively benign. 
Turning to financing conditions, both real and nominal short-term interest 
rates are still at relatively low levels 
(despite the gradual increase in policy 
rates by the major central banks in the EU since 2005), money and credit 
growth continues to be brisk and liquidity is ample by all measures. Long-
term bond yields have increased less, remaining low by historical 
standards. The yield curve thus flattened significantly during the second 
half of 2006. Despite mounting imbalances at the global level, risk premia 

have stayed close to their historical lo
ws. Although the recent turbulence in 
equity markets prompted a reassessmen
t of risks, the impact was mostly 
short-lived. Overall, financing conditions
 should remain supportive to real-
sector activity in the near term. 
Looking ahead, survey data generally point to continued robust growth in 
the first half of this year. The upturn appears broad-based. All sectors 
except construction have contributed 
to the improvement in the economic 
sentiment indicator in the Commissi
on's recent business and consumer 
surveys. Although volatile on a monthly basis, almost all sectoral 
confidence indices have been on an upward trend since mid-2005. The 
Financing conditions 
remain growth-

exception is again the construction sect
or where confidence seems to have 
peaked in the autumn of last year. 
National business surveys have given 
mixed signals in recent months, but 
even those that have eased lately ar
e still at elevated
 levels, suggesting 
economic expansion will progress at a healthy clip in the short term. As a 

benchmark, when taking into account recent hard and soft data, DG 
ECFIN's Dynamic Factor Model proj
ects euro-area GDP growth of, on 
average, 0.6-0.7% QoQ during the first three quarters of 2007. 
Against this backdrop, output is projected to grow in 2007 at 2.9% in the 
EU and 2.6% in the euro area, margin
ally lower than last year. Economic 
activity will be supported by buoyant domestic demand and continued 
strong, though somewhat more tempered export market growth. For 2008, 
prospects are for a further slight moderation in economic activity, to 2.7% 

in the EU and 2.5% in the euro area. This follows, in particular, from the 
impact of the progressive withdrawal of monetary stimulus on domestic 
demand. 
Growth in equipment investment shou
ld maintain its vigorous pace over 
the forecast period, bolstered by upbeat demand expectations, high 

corporate profitability, supportive financing conditions, a high rate of 
capacity utilisation and an increased need to invest in new technologies. 
Construction investment was supported by unusually warm winter weather 
at the start of this year. However, a slowdown in mortgage lending due to 
rising borrowing costs and an expected cooling of house price inflation in 

some countries are likely to gradually dampen growth in construction 
investment in the two forecast years. 
In Germany, the impact of the VAT 
increase will temporarily curb housing investment in 2007, albeit not as 

much as earlier foreseen. 
Private consumption is predicted to pursue its steady upward trend, 
establishing itself progressively as the mainstay of growth. In the euro 
area, the growth contribution of this demand component is expected to rise 
from 1 pp. in 2006 to an estimated 1½ pps. by 2008. Rapid employment 

growth and accelerating wages in combination with a moderate inflation 
outlook are underpinning the outlook for real labour income growth. 
Moreover, consumer confidence has perked up, boosted by falling 

unemployment. With the households saving rate projected to stabilise over 
the forecast period, private cons
umption will expand at a rate 
commensurate with the growth of household income. In Germany, the 

negative impact of the increase in the VAT is likely to be eclipsed by the 
impressive turnaround in the labour market.  
Exporters in the EU and the euro area sh
ould continue to benefit from still-
robust world growth over the for
ecast horizon. However, the projected 
moderation of world trade and an appreciation in nominal effective terms 
will limit the growth contribution from net exports for both the euro area 
and the EU as a whole. Market shares
 of EU and euro-area exporters are 
assumed to revert to their trend decline. This decline, which can be mainly 
attributed to losses to emerging ma
rket economies, was interrupted last

year by exceptionally strong gain
s for Germany. There are sustained 
differences between Member States with
 respect to the evolution of market 
shares, only part of which can be 
explained by differences in cost 
competitiveness. 
The solid momentum in the European 
cycle masks a significant dispersion 
of growth rates across Member States. Although the growth dispersion 
declined between 2005 and 2006, not least due to the pick-up in some of 
the larger euro-area countries, real GDP growth in 2007 is projected to 

range from 1¾% to almost 10% in the EU. Part of this can be explained by 
the ongoing process of real converge
nce in the recen
tly-acceded Member 
States, but there are also sizeable
 differences among the euro-area 
countries. 
In line with the usual lagged response, the current economic upturn 
reached the labour market, at last, in
 2006. Compared to the year before, 
employment growth almost doubled, to 1.5% in the EU and 1.4% in the 
euro area. This is the fastest pace 
since 2000 and corresponds to 3.3 
million new jobs in the EU (2.0 million of which were in the euro area). 
The improvement appears broad-based across both sectors and countries. 
Prospects are for a continued robust 
labour market performance over the 
forecast period, with employment grow
th of around 1¼% on average in 
both the EU and the euro area. This corresponds to a total of 5.5 million 
new jobs in the EU in the period 2007-08 (3.8 million in the euro area). 
Against a background of robust employment growth, the employment rate 
will rise to around 65½% of the working-age population in the EU by 2008 
(about 66% in the euro area), which would, however, still be low by 
international standards. This may be partly explained by labour supply. In 

2005, labour force participation in 
the euro-area was around 5 pps. lower 
than in the US, where it 
exceeded 75%. Nevertheless, the labour force has 
increased markedly in several Member 
States, particularly in Spain. This 
improvement follows from an increase in the female participation rate, the 
impact of earlier pension reforms 
and, in some Member States, a 
regularisation of undeclared workers. 
The unemployment rate improved substantially last year when it fell below 
8% of the labour force in both
 the EU and the euro area. The 
unemployment rate is expected to drop further, to reach 6.7% in the EU 
and 6.9% in the euro area by 2008. 
This is explained above all by an 
improved performance in the 
larger Member States and can be attributed to 
a large extent to the strong cyclical 
upswing. However, estimates also point 
to a reduction in the structural unemployment rate (NAWRU), which is 
projected to fall to around 7% by 2008, ½ pp. lower than in 2006. 
As a consequence of the improved labour market outlook, nominal wage 
growth is set to accelerate over the fo
recast period. However, past reform 
efforts, which have made European labour markets more flexible, and 
ongoing competitive pressures from globalisation are expected to have a 

moderating effect on wages. Furthermore, the rise in unit labour costs is 
5½ million new jobs in 
the EU in 2007-2008...

limited by the recent pick-up in la
bour productivity gr
owth which is 
projected to continue going forward.  
There are significant cro
ss-country differences in
 the evolution of unit 
labour costs. This is true also for 
the countries in th
e euro area, where 
relative competitive positions as measured by unit labour costs have drifted 

apart over past years. While, in a monetary union, this process should 
reverse at some stage, according to 
the forecast there will be no such 
turnaround in the period 2007-2008. 
The revised outlook, which indicates a stronger growth momentum than 
previously projected, raises questions 
as to where the EU and the euro-area 
economies actually stand in terms of 
the business cycle. When comparing 
the current economic upswing with the av
erage of the past four recoveries, 
the compound growth rate of GDP is still some 1½ pps. lower than that 

reached at the same stage in earlier cy
cles. The difference is explained by 
private consumption, for which a substantial gap exists between its growth 
in this cycle and that of past cycles. This seems to be due in turn to a 

subdued rise in real wages, while employment growth has been largely in 
line with the pattern of previous cycles. As a counterpart to moderate wage 
increases, profits have seen a sustained rise which, in combination with 

benign financing conditions, has boosted investment. Indeed, investment 
spending is currently higher than at the same stage in past cycles (although 
this is to some extent also explained by the current housing boom in some 
of the Member States). 
The deviation of the cyclical evolution of GDP from past patterns is 
mirrored by estimates of the output gap. Almost four years after the start of 
this recovery in 2003, and despite the improvement in 2006, the output gap 

is estimated to be still in negative territory. By contrast, the gap between 
the actual and the structural unemploym
ent rate has narrowed significantly. 
Similarly, indicators of capacity utilisation rates point to incipient capacity 
The current upswing is 
not exceptionally 

strong, so far

shortages. There is therefore a discre
pancy between different measures of 
slack, with the output gap indicating the existence of a certain degree of 
economic slack in a broad sense, while input-based measures point to 

emerging shortages for labour and capital and hence potential price 
pressures further ahead.  
In the short term, however, inflationary pressures remain well contained. 
Rising energy prices until late summer 
of last year kept consumer price 
inflation above 2% (year-on-year). With oil and energy prices reversing 

thereafter, headline HICP inflation fe
ll below 2% in the autumn of 2006 
(resulting in annual average inflation of some 2¼% in both the EU and the 
euro area). While headline inflation ha
s stayed below this threshold since, 
core inflation, i.e. changes in the 
HICP excluding energy and unprocessed 
food, has started to edge up recently, thereby closing the gap between 
headline and core inflation observed over the last two years. The rise in 

core inflation appears to be due mainly to the price effects of the VAT hike 
in Germany, while indirect and second-round effects of high oil prices 
have been very limited so far.  
Looking ahead, average annual HICP inflation is projected to decline to 
2.2% in the EU and 1.9% in the euro
 area in 2007. This represents a 
downward revision of 0.2 pp. for the 
euro area compared to the autumn 
2006 forecast. Factors explaining th
is downward revision are lower oil 
prices at the turn of the year, favourab
le base effects in the first half of 
2007 and a more muted initial impact of the German VAT hike. In 2008, 
headline inflation is expected to remain broadly unchanged. However, if 

the impact of the German VAT hike on consumer prices is excluded 
(estimated to add around 0.3 pp. to euro-area inflation in 2007), the profile 
of inflation shows a clear accelera
tion between 2007 and 2008 (of around 
¼-½ pp.), reflecting an underlying rise, if limited, of price pressures.  
Inflation rates across Member States show substantial variation. Within the 
euro area, inflation in the country with the highest inflation rate in 2006 
was more than 2 pp. higher than in the country with the lowest inflation 
rate, with this gap narrowing some
what in the two forecast years (to 
around 1½ pp. in 2008). 
Differences are even larger within the group of 
countries which have linked their exchange rate to the euro (ERM II 
Member States, Bulgaria). The gap between the maximum and minimum 

inflation rate was 5½ pps. in 2006 for 
this group and is fo
recast to rise to 
almost 6 pps. in 2007, before declining to around 4 pps. in 2008.   
The current account is broadly in balan
ce in the EU and the euro area, but 
varies across Member States. Large and 
growing deficits are, in particular, 
projected for some of the catching-up
 economies, with the highest values 
topping 20% of GDP. The use of external savings can play an important 
role in facilitating income convergence
, especially if capital comes in the 
form of foreign direct investment.  
However, persistent sizeable current 
account deficits can raise concern a
bout sustainability, particularly if 
investment and productivity growth are low and capital inflows are 

directed into consumption or real estate 
or if external borrowing is at levels 
that could trigger financial stress.

- 8 - 
On the back of the economic recovery, 
public finances improved markedly 
last year with the general government budget deficit falling from 2.4% in 
2005 to 1.7% of GDP in 2006 in the EU (from 2.5% to 1.6% in the euro 
area). This follows from the impact 
of stronger economic growth and a 
pick-up in the so-called tax elasticitie
s (i.e. a higher responsiveness of tax 
revenues to changes in the tax bases). The better-than-expected outturn in 

2006 is set to have a positive impact throughout the forecast period with 
the deficit declining to 1.2% of GDP in the EU this year (1% of GDP in the 
euro area). A further decline, albeit sm
all, is foreseen for 2008 on the usual 
no-policy-change assumption. 
The projected improvement in public finances is relatively broad-based 
across Member States. There are ten c
ountries currently in the excessive 
deficit procedure (EDP), but the deficit is expected to fall below 3% of 
GDP in six of them. This was achieved already in 2006 in the Czech 
Republic, Germany, Greece, Malta a
nd the United Kingdom. The deficit 
should fall below the threshold in Italy and Slovakia this year. In the euro 
area, only Portugal is predicted to have a deficit above 3% of GDP in 2007 

and, in the absence of further 
measures, also in 2008. Marked 
improvements were also observed in Hungary and, to a lesser extent, in 
Poland, whereas the defi
cit in the Czech Repub
lic is predicted to 
deteriorate again this year. Outside 
the countries currently in the EDP, 
Romania is expected to post a deficit 
above 3% of GDP this year and next. 
Taking into account temporary measures 
and cyclical factors, the structural 
deficit also fell markedly last year: from 2% in both areas in 2005 to 1.1% 

of GDP in the euro area and 1.3% in the EU in 2006. However, the 
improvement in 2007-2008 is more muted than that of the nominal 
balance, which raises the issue of ho
w to foster fiscal consolidation in 
economically good times. 
In contrast to the increasing trend of recent years, the improvement in 
public finances in 2006 was sufficient to allow for a fall in general 
government gross debt, which declined by more than 1 pps. to 61.7% of 
GDP in the EU (down by 1½ pps. to 69% in the euro area). This positive 

development is set to continue with the debt gradually falling to 58.3% of 
GDP by 2008 in the EU (65% in th
e euro area). This downward trend is 
relatively broad-based across Member States, with increases limited to 

seven countries (and by as much as 2 pps. in Hungary). However, 
differences in debt levels are sizeable, 
with the level of gross debt ranging 
from below 10% of GDP in Estonia, Latvia and Luxembourg to above 

100% in Italy by 2008. 
Summing up, the economic outlook in the EU and the euro area is for 
continued robust growth, a
bove potential in both forecast years, albeit with 
a slight deceleration in economic ac
tivity in 2008. However, there are 
several risk factors to the outlook that need to be considered. These risks 
seem broadly balanced in 2007, but tilted to the downside in 2008.  
Upside risks are primarily related to domestic demand, which could turn 
out more buoyant than projected. In particular, the favourable labour

market developments may give a further boost to both labour income and 
consumer confidence. This could unleash some of the pent-up demand that 
accumulated during this cycle of unusua
lly restrained consumer spending. 
The saving rate would thereby retu
rn to its trend decline following a 
temporary sharp rise after the bursting of the dot-com bubble.  
The major downside risk to the baseline scenario, already identified in the 
autumn, is a more pronounced slowdown in the US economy. Although a 
relatively limited slowdown of the 
US economy now appears more likely, 
recent data have sent rather mixed si
gnals on the depth and breadth of the 
downturn in the housing market. For instance, while problems in the sub-
prime mortgage market have accumulate
d in recent months, they have not 
extended to the high-quality segments so far. If they do, the implications 
for US mortgage lending and housing markets could be serious, with 
inevitable knock-on effects on the US banking sector and the performance 

of the broader economy. Moreover, a 
sharper-than-expected US economic 
slowdown could be a catalyst for a return
 to a more normal pricing of risks 
and possibly also a correspondingly abrupt unwinding of financial 

imbalances globally. The recent e
quity-market turbulence once more 
demonstrated the heightened sensitivity of investors to adverse 
developments in the global economy. Further ahead, the domestic side also 

poses some downside risks. In particular, a sharper slowdown of housing 
investment in some Member States 
cannot be excluded on the back of 
easing house price inflation and higher borrowing costs.  
Regarding the inflation outlook, inflationary pressures are expected to 
remain moderate in 2007. But as the cycle matures and the labour market 
tightens, wage pressures may emerge towards the end of the forecast 
period that go beyond the assumptions
 of this forecast. Moreover, oil 
prices have been on the rise recently
 due in part to renewed geo-political 
tensions. In the absence of a solution to these conflicts, upside risks to the 
oil price assumption are likely to outweigh downside risks. While the 

economy has so far weathered the strong rise in oil prices since 2003 
surprisingly well, it cannot be excluded that, at some stage, a further rise in 
the oil price level would also have a significant negative impact on the real 

economy. 
 Chapter 1 The world economy  1. Some moderation of global growth 
- 13 - 
The outlook for the global economy remains positive. 
In the US, annual GDP growth reached 3.3% in 2006. 
In Asia, a slight decelera
tion was observed in the 
course of the year, but growth remains robust in most 
countries, including Japan. In Eastern Europe, Latin 
America, Africa and the Middle East, economies 

continue to expand at a r
obust pace. All in all, world 
GDP growth is expected to moderate only slightly 
over the forecast period, from 5.2% in 2006 to 4.8% 

in both 2007 and 2008.     
The expected scenario from
 the autumn of a soft 
landing in the US remains in place. In spite of the 
housing market downturn and the accompanying 

sharp decline in residential investment, GDP growth 
was above 2% (in annualised terms) in the last three 
quarters of 2006. Manufacturing production 

decelerated, mainly due 
to an adjustment in 
inventories. At the same time, consumption remained 
resilient, supported by a solid rise in disposable 

income, a further fall in the personal saving rate, and 
the impact of lower energy prices. Going forward, the 
main downside risks are a 
deeper and longer-lasting 
correction in the housing sector than expected and 
more serious spillovers to the rest of the economy. 

There also continue to be 
risks associated with the 
large current account deficit.  
GDP growth supported 
by emerging economies 
In spite of a certain deceleration of world output 
growth in the fourth quarter of 2006, indicators point 

to still-vigorous activity in early 2007. While the US 
economy has slowed down to a growth path below 
trend, the momentum of many other economies, 

especially in Asia, appears to have limited the 
moderation of world growth. The robustness of the 
global economy is confirmed by the latest data, in 

particular the rebound of the global manufacturing 
PMI index, which is normally a good leading 
indicator of world trade growth.  
The slight easing projected in global activity is thus 
mainly explained by the situation in the US, where the 
correction in the housing market will continue to exert 
a drag on economic activity. As a consequence, output 
growth in the US is expected to remain below the 
long-term potential in 2007, with an annual growth 

rate of 2.2%. The manufactur
ing cycle is also easing 
at the global level. However, in the most dynamic 
economies, such as China, 
the CIS countries and Latin 
America, growth will moderate only slightly,

supported by a solid pace of
 exports. In Japan, the 
expansion should continue, as consumption will be 
sustained by a favourable labour market situation, 

while investment might benefit from a high level of 
capacity utilisation and strong corporate profits. 
Growth in global imports of goods and services (excl. 
EU-27) is expected to rema
in relatively buoyant at an 
average of 7½% in 2007 and 7¾% in 2008, down 
from 8.4% in 2006. A certain slowdown follows from 

the reduced contribution of the US to global import 
growth, which is projected to decline from 1.6 pps. in 
2006 to 0.9 pp. in 2007. The contribution of Latin 

America and sub-Saharan Africa should also decrease 
from the very high levels
 reached in 2006. On the 
other hand, the contribution of Asia and other 

industrialised countries will remain broadly constant. 
The saving rate of US households is projected to 
improve only slightly, remaining negative in 2007. 
Consequently, global imbalances are not expected to 

diminish, with the US current account deficit 
remaining above 6% of GDP in both 2007 and 2008. 
Oil-exporting countries a
nd China will absorb an 
increasing share of the corresponding surpluses.

%deterioration of growth expectations. Second, 
nervousness was amplified by reports that Alan 
Greenspan had spoken of a possible recession in the 

US economy in 2007. Lastly, rising default rates in 
the sub-prime mortgage market increased concerns 
that a transmission to the much larger high-quality 

mortgage segment could trigger a credit crunch.   
However, equity markets proved resilient, as losses 
have been mostly recovered. Hence, the turbulence 
may have just been a technical correction which might 

even be welcomed as a necessary 'shake-out' of the 
international equity markets. On the other hand, it 
may also signal increased sensitivity of investors to 

any deterioration in global economic conditions in a 
context of historically low levels of credit-risk premia. 
A widespread and durable widening of risk premia in 

the international financial system would have a 
significant impact on
 real-sector activity. 
–while the slide in oil prices came to an end  
After having peaked at al
most USD 80/bl. in early 
August 2006, oil prices trended downwards until 
January 2007, when th
ey reached a low of 
USD 51.8/bl. The decline was mainly attributable to 

the end of the hostilities in Lebanon, an unusually 
calm hurricane season, mild weather conditions in 
early winter and concerns
 about the prospects for 
global growth. However, prices have risen again since 
February, spurred by upward revisions to future oil 
demand growth (oil demand is estimated to grow by 

1.8% in 2007 after rising by only 1.0% in 2006, 
according to  the Interna
tional Energy Agency), a

Against this background, oi
l prices are assumed to 
remain relatively high over the forecast period. 

Contracts in the futures ma
rket indicate that prices 
may range from USD 67 to 70 per barrel in the near to 
medium term. Based on such contracts, the forecast 
assumes the price of a ba
rrel of Brent to average 
USD 66.2 in 2007 and USD 70.3 in 2008.  
The rebound in oil prices could reinforce the 
slowdown of the US economy, which is particularly 
energy-intensive and benefits to a comparatively 
lesser degree from exports to the oil-producing 

countries. Furthermore, it could lead to a re-
acceleration of consumer prices, thereby weighing on 
the purchasing power of households. 
Long-term interest rates remain close to 
historically low levels 
Long-term interest rates have followed a quite similar 
pattern in the euro area and in the US, but with a 
narrowing of the spread between the two regions 

resulting from a reassessment of risks. In the euro 
area, 10-year benchmark yields increased from 3.6% 
at the beginning of October 2006 to roughly 4.2% at 

the end of April 2007, in line with the improved 
growth outlook. Due to the ongoing withdrawal of 
monetary stimulus, the euro yield curve has flattened 
but remains slightly upward sloping.

 In the USA, the 10-year benchmark yields have 
remained roughly stable since last autumn, oscillating 
around 4.60%. At the end of January 2007, the higher-

than-expected resilience of the US economy pushed 
yields temporarily up to 4.90%, but subsequent 
worries about the sub-prime mortgage market have 

led investors to look for safe assets. The US yield 
curve remains inverted up to
 a 5-year maturity, and 
the 10-year/3-month yield sp
read amounts to about 50 
basis points. This is partly explained by continued 
high demand for longer-dated government bonds, 
especially from institutional investors.   
The real exchange rate of the euro has slightly 
appreciated 
The ongoing withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the 
euro area has reduced the interest rate differential with 

the US. This, in conjunction with the improved 
growth outlook for the euro area, has led to a 
sustained appreciation of 
the euro against the US 
dollar. The euro has also appreciated against the 
Japanese yen. While monetary tightening in Japan is 
taking place very gradually, the low level of Japanese 

interest rates, together with low volatility in foreign 
exchange markets, has further increased the yen's 
attractiveness as a funding 
currency. However, with 
the British pound and other European currencies 
remaining broadly stable vis-à-vis the euro, the 
appreciation of the euro in effective terms has been 

limited.

 Outlook by region 
World GDP growth remained strong in 2006 at about 
5¼%. This was slightly more than expected in the 
2006 autumn forecast, the discrepancy stemming 

essentially from better-than-expected growth in Asia 
(excl. Japan) and Latin America. As the deceleration 
of the world economy is expected to be moderate, 

world output growth is projected to continue to 
expand at a rate close to 5% in 2007 and 2008. World 
trade growth is also expect
ed to ease slightly from an 
average annual rate of around 8½% in 2006 to around 
7¾% in 2007 and 2008. However, most of this decline 
reflects a decrease in import growth in the Americas, 
while import growth in Asia should remain broadly 
stable. The US economy
, which had expanded above its 
long-term potential for th
ree years, slowed down 
significantly from the second quarter of 2006, with 
average annualised growth 
falling to below 2½%. The 
downturn was concentrated in the housing sector, with 
a sharp contraction of residential investment. 
Manufacturing has also cooled down, reflecting an 

adjustment of business inventories.  
Private consumption has so far been supported by 
solid employment growth, rising wages, a fall in 
energy prices since last 
summer, and lower household 
saving. In the current 
year, however, a fall in 
consumer spending growth seems inevitable. 
Furthermore, business investment has softened 

considerably and residential investment could fall 
further. Although an improving trade performance

will provide some offset in the near term, annual GDP 
growth is expected to decline to 2.2% in 2007, with 
risks tilted to the downside. 
For 2008, the forecast is 
for US GDP to edge up to 2.7% as the housing 
correction peters out. 
The Japanese
 economy
 grew at an average annual 
rate of 2.2% in 2006, which is above Japan's potential 

growth rate but still ½ pp 
below the autumn forecast. 
This outcome is mainly explained by a sharp decline 
in private consumption in the third quarter of 2006 
and significant data revisions for previous quarters. 
Private domestic demand is projected to remain the 

main driver of GDP growth
, as consumption will be 
supported by rising confidence, a favourable situation 
in the labour market and a reduction in the tax burden 

on households. As for investment, business 
confidence and the rate of capacity utilisation rate are 
on the rise. Overall, this should lead to GDP growth 

exceeding 2% in bo
th 2007 and 2008. 
Economic growth in the 
rest of Asia
 is expected to 
continue on a strong footing over the forecast period. 
After growing by an estimated 8.7% in 2007, real 

GDP growth is expected to moderate slightly to 8.3% 
in 2007 and 8.4% in 2008. This is in line with the 
impact of decelerating export growth to the US, and 

the impact of past oil pr
ice increases. However, the 
aggregated regional growth figures mask variations 
across the different economies. 
China's
 economic growth remained very strong in 
2006. Following a revised GDP growth rate of 10.4% 
in 2005, GDP growth accel
erated to an estimated 
10.7% in 2006. Key factors behind this higher-than-

expected growth were net merchandise exports and

spending, which the 
tightening measures introduced by the government 
last year have not been able to rein in. China's 

economic growth is expect
ed to ease somewhat in 
2007, to 10.5%, as the fu
rther tightening measures 
introduced by the 
Chinese administration take effect 
in the course of the year. 
In 2008, as external demand 
should remain resilient and private consumption 
should accelerate slightly, GD
P growth is expected to 
remain above 10.0%. The trade and current account 
surpluses are set to exceed last year's
 record in 2007 
and to keep growing also in 2008.  
Growth in 
India
 is also projected to moderate 
gradually over the forecast period, from 8.7% in 2006 
to 7.6% in 2007 and 7.4% in 2008. This slowdown is 
explained by strong but somewhat easing domestic 
demand due to the monetary tightening which began 
in October 2004. In the rest of Asia, economic growth 

is expected to remain slightly above 5% in 2007 and 
2008. While divergences exist across countries, the 
contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth   

generally tends to decline somewhat while exports 
remain buoyant. This could be a source of 
vulnerability in the event of a sharp slowdown in the 

USA. Even if the intra-regional trade linkages have 
increased and the share of the USA in Asian exports 
has decreased, there is still no clear evidence that the 

Asian economies have become more resilient to the 
American cycle.

The world economy

should increase to 3.2% in 2007, before moderating 
somewhat to 2.7% in 2008. Domestic activity should 
continue to be the main driver of growth, in spite of 

tax increases which are expected to dampen 
consumption growth in 2007, and the completion of 
investment projects in the oil and gas sector. 

Switzerland's
 GDP growth increased to 2.9% in 
2006, reflecting a strengthening of external demand. 
In 2007 and 2008, growth is expected to return to 

rates around 2%, mainly due to a slowdown of 
exports. 
Economic growth in 
Turkey
 reached about 6% last 
year. In spite of a certain slowdown of domestic 

demand after the financial market turbulences in 
spring 2006, the Turkish economy seems sufficiently 
resilient and dynamic to expand at a pace of around 

5% in 2007 and 6% in 2008, broadly in line with its 
potential. In 
Croatia
, economic growth is expected to 
remain at around 4½% in 2007-08 while in the 

former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
 GDP 
growth is likely to experience an acceleration from 
3.1% in 2006 to 4.3% in 2007 and 5.3% in 2008. 
However, as this momentum is driven by strong 
domestic demand growth, trade imbalances are 

projected to rise. They are 
expected to be offset by 
capital inflows (mainly FDI) and workers' 
remittances. 
The CIS region
 is the second-fastest-growing region 
after developing Asia, with economic growth of some 
7.5% in 2006 and expectations at 7% for 2007-08. 

Economic growth in 
Russia
 reached 6.7% in 2006 
thanks to the robust growth in domestic demand 
which offset the fall in ener
gy prices at the end of the 
year. Even if this fall leads to a decline in the 
contribution of exports in 2007, GDP growth is 
expected to remain buoyan
t at about 6½% in 2007-08. 
Economic growth in the 
other CIS countries 
rebounded to 10% in 2006 and is expected to remain 
around 7.5% in 2007-08. The strengthening of growth 

in the region mainly reflects 
Ukraine's
 recovery, with 
GDP growth projected at 7.1% in 2007 compared to 
2.6% in 2006. 
Economic growth in 
Latin America reached 5.4% in 
2006, marking the fourth consecutive year of 
economic expansion. External conditions remain 
favourable with strong global demand, high 

commodity prices and benign financing conditions, 
while domestic demand is strengthening thanks to 
improving labour markets. In line with the expected 
moderation in the world economy and a stabilisation 
of some commodity prices, GDP growth in the region

 Economic forecast, spring 2007

is expected to decrease slightly, to around 4½% in 
2007 and 4% in 2008. However, while the resilience 
of some economies has in
creased due to improved 
fiscal positions and larger o
fficial reserves, the region 
remains vulnerable to external shocks, such as an 
unexpectedly sharp slowdown 
in the US or Asia and 
variations in commodity prices. 
GDP growth in the 
MENA (Middle East and North 
Africa)
 region
 was 5.4% in 2006 and is expected to 
remain above 5% in 2008. In Saudi Arabia and the 

United Arab Emirates, domestic demand and public 
spending are underpinned by rising oil export 
revenues. However, as the economic impact of 

ongoing geopolitical uncertainties and regional 
conflicts cannot be excluded, risks continue to be 
high. 
In sub-Saharan Africa
, GDP growth in 2006 was 
around 5½%, almost the same rate as in the preceding 
year. Domestic demand was supported by oil revenues 

in oil-exporting countries,
 although oil production 
basically stagnated due to technical and political 
problems. At the same time, external demand for 

other commodities, especially metals, helped sustain 
growth also in oil-importing countries. In 2007, GDP 
growth is expected to increase to 6½%, still supported 

by external demand and an easing of some of the 
production constraints seen in 2006. Following this 
exceptional effect, in 2008 
growth should
 decelerate 
slightly, to about 6%. 
Lastly, Canada's 
economy slowed down in the 
course of 2006 due to reduced US demand. However, 
domestic demand should continue to support GDP 

growth, which fell to 2.7 % in 2006 and is projected 
to decline further to 2.4% in 2007 before edging up to 
2.9% in 2008. In Australia, GDP growth was 2.6% in 

2005 and 2006, after years of rates above 4%. 
Looking ahead, growth should
 accelerate gradually to 
2.9% in 2007 and 3.1% in 2008, due to resilient 
consumption, favourable financing conditions, and an 
improving contribution from net exports. 
Chapter 2 The economic situation in the euro area and the EU  1. Solid growth in the face of headwinds 
- 21 - 
The recovery gains traction – 
The economy of the European Union shifted gear in 
2006 as output growth picked up markedly after a 
prolonged period of sluggishness. In both the euro 

area and the EU, average quarter-on-quarter GDP 
growth rose to an annualised rate of more than 3%. In 
the first half of the year, output growth even reached 

an annualised 3½% in the euro area, moderating to 
3% in the second half (from 3¾% to 3¼% in the EU). 
However, as quarterly growth rates tend to be volatile, 

the significance of the slowdown in the second half of 
2006 should not be overstated, particularly as it was 
largely due to a decelera
tion in a single country, 
namely France, where economic activity almost 
stagnated in the third quarter.  
For the year as a whole, 
GDP grew by 2.7% in the 
euro area and 3% in the EU, which represents an 

upward revision by 0.1 and 0.2 pp., respectively, 
compared to the autumn forecast. For both areas, this 
was the best performance 
since 2000 and a robust 
acceleration compared to 
the preceding three years 
when growth averaged a modest 1.4% in the euro area 
and 1.8% in the EU.  
The strength of output growth in 2006 surprised on 
the upside as it took place against a background of 
persistently high oil prices, less accommodative 

monetary conditions and concerns over a slowdown 
of US growth. While the US slowdown turned out 
somewhat milder than ex
pected, the favourable 
growth performance of the EU economy also seems to 
reflect an improved resilience against adverse external 
developments. As a result of the EU decoupling from 

the US, the growth gap between the US and the EU 
narrowed significantly, from 
an average of 1.5 pps. in 
the period 2003-2005 to 0.6 pp. in 2006. On a per- 

capita basis, growth in 2006 in the EU (at 2.6%) 
exceeded US growth (2.3%) 
for the first time since 
2002. 
In 2006, again for the first 
time since the beginning of 
the decade actual output growth was clearly above the 
estimated potential growth rate. While the output gap 
narrowed therefore, it remain
ed in negative territory 
for both areas, suggesting the continued existence of 
economic slack in a broad sense. However, this stands 

in some contrast with survey information indicating 
that, by the end of 2006,
 the rate of capacity 
utilisation reached the peak levels observed in the 

1998-2000 boom.

Composition of growth in 2006 - euro area
(Quarter-on-quarter % ch.)
(Contributions in pp.)
 ... and broadens 
The rebound of the economy was underpinned by a 
strengthening of growth in domestic demand which 
rose to 2.6% in the euro
 area (3.0% in the EU), 
compared to an average of
 1.7% during the period 
2003-2005 (2.1% in the EU). The pick-up in domestic 
demand reflected brisk investment growth and a 

revival, albeit more gradual, of household spending. 
At the same time, the contribution of net exports to 
GDP growth turned positive, despite the euro 
appreciating in effectiv
e terms and the economic 
activity of some key trading partners weakening.   
There continued to be GDP growth differentials 
across Member States. However, macroeconomic 
developments were more uniform during 2006 than in 
2005, as growth improved in some of the large euro-

area economies which had lagged behind in previous 
years. The dispersion of GDP growth rates, as 
measured by the standard deviation, declined by 10% 

between 2005 and 2006. More similar developments 
were particularly noticeable
 between the four largest 
euro-area Member States (i.e. Germany, France, Italy 

and Spain). An important factor behind the reduction 
of the growth dispersion among these four economies

.was the behaviour of private consumption, which saw   
a rebound in both Germany and Italy following 
several years of sluggishness. 
An improving labour market supports 
consumption  
Private consumption gathered pace in 2006 across 
Member States. Most significantly, private 
consumption grew by 0.8% in Germany and by 1.5% 

in Italy. While these are ha
rdly awe-inspiring figures, 
they represent a clear improvement over the preceding 
three-year period where private consumption 

stagnated in Germany and grew by an annual average 
of 0.8% in Italy. The pace of private consumption was 
somewhat slower in the euro
 area (1.7%) than in the 
EU (2.1%), partly due 
to the impact of a 
reclassification of hea
lth-care spending in the 
Netherlands (which statistically lowered private 

consumption, whilst raising public consumption) and 
a weakening of household spending in Portugal.  
Despite the improved performance in 2006, private 
consumption remains 2 pps. below the level reached 

at this stage in previous cycles. The low growth of 
private consumption since 
2003 mirrors the pace of 
wage growth, which remained exceptionally subdued 
over a prolonged period in some Member States, 
particularly in Germany. While this was welcome as a 

means to restore external competitiveness in these 
countries, it also acted as a brake on the growth rate of 
household income and, thereby, on private 

consumption. The slow d
eceleration in headline 
inflation, which was kept up by soaring energy prices,

was an additional factor weighing on the purchasing 
power of households. 
Investment becomes a key driver of growth  
A second important pillar of demand growth last year 
was gross fixed capital formation. Investment 

spending rose by 4.7% in the euro area (5.6% in the 
EU), contributing 1.0 pp. to overall GDP growth 
(1.1 pps. in the EU). 
Corporate investment was underpinned by several 
factors. First, as suggested by the Commission™s 
investment survey, corporate investment was 

supported by an improved outlook for overall 
demand. Second, capacity utilisation in the 
manufacturing sector had steadily increased since late 

2005, to stand at 84.8% in the second quarter of 2007 
in the euro area (84.5% in
 the EU), exceeding the 
peak observed in late 2000. Third, firms benefited 

from still-favourable financing conditions. Long-term 
interest rates moved up only moderately, while risk 
spreads remained narrow. Moreover, according to the 

ECB™s bank lending survey, credit standards were 
broadly stable throughout the year, following their 
earlier easing. Fourth, co
mpanies could count on 
ample own resources to carry out their investment 
plans. Finally, profitability stayed high. The gross 
operating surplus of the corporate sector (adjusted for 
compensations of self-employed) rose to 30.2% of 
GDP in 2006, a record high 
in this decade. Real unit 
labour costs, which can be interpreted as an inverted 
measure for profit margins, dropped by 0.9% in the 
euro area(1.1% in the EU),
 accelerating their decline 
compared to the preceding three years. These positive

fundamentals were reflected 
in business survey results 
which showed optimism in the business sector close  

to or above the peak values observed in 2000. 
Strong construction activity was a further element 
behind the recovery of fixed investment in 2006. 
Helped by a revived construction sector in Germany, 

euro-area construction invest
ment accelerated to 4.5% 
last year, from an average of 1.2% in the period 2003-
2005. Although quarterly data for construction 

activity tend to be volatile, the broad picture of an 
ongoing expansion prevailed throughout the year, 
with construction investment in the second half of 
2006 expanding at an annua
lised rate of almost 4½%. 
This is consistent with data from surveys which 

continued to point to strong construction activity in 
the second half of 2006. Confidence in the 
construction sector, as measured by the Commission 

survey, trended upwards during most of 2006 and, 
despite some easing in the fourth quarter, ended the 
year well above its long-term average. 
Strong contribution from net exports 
In 2006, world trade (excluding the EU) is estimated 
to have grown by 8.4%, slightly above the value 
registered in 2005. According to the latest estimates 
of the CPB Netherlands, 
world trade accelerated to 
around 10% (annualised) in the second half of 2006, 
compared to less than 7% in the first half.  
Exporters in the EU clearly benefited from this 
dynamic trade environment.

10% in the euro area and 6½
% in the EU. For the year 
as a whole, exports grew by
 8.2% in the euro area and 
9.2% in the EU. 
Expectations of a deceleration in EU exports in 
conjunction with a slowdown of the US economy 

have not materialised, so far. This may be explained 
by the fact that the cooling of the US economy 
appears largely limited to the housing sector which 

has a low import intensity. In addition, the share of 
euro-area exports to the US
 has declined in recent 
years. The share of export
s of goods, for instance, 
came down from 17% in 1999 to 15% in 2006.  
Reflecting the robust pace of expansion in domestic 
demand, euro-area imports accelerated during 2006, 
from less than 7% (annualised) in the first half of 

2006 to above 8% in the 
second half. On the year, 
imports rose by 7.7% in the euro area compared to 
5.2% the year before (9.1% versus 5.8% in the EU). 
Despite the acceleration of imports, the contribution 
of net trade to GDP growth improved in 2006 (by 
0.5 pp. in the euro area and 0.2 pp. in the EU). The 
strength of global trade more
 than offset the effects of 
the moderate appreciation of
 the euro in effective 
terms (+0.8%). However, the picture is very different 

for individual Member States
.  Looking at the larger 
economies, the contribution of net trade to GDP 
growth was +1.1 pps. in Germany, +0.3 pp. in Italy, 

-0.2 pp. in Poland, -0.3 pp. in France and -0.4 pp. in 
the UK, while in Spain net 
trade subtracted as much 
as 1 pp. from growth. 
2. Interest rate assumption and financial 
conditions - 24 - 
Financing conditions remain favourable, despite 
tighter monetary policy 
Since December 2005, the ECB has raised interest 
rates by a total of 175 basis points to 3.75 percent for 

the euro area. Despite these interest rate increases, 
both real and nominal short-term interest rates are still 
at relatively low levels, 
money and credit growth 
continues to be strong, and liquidity in the euro area is 
ample by all measures. Moreover, long-term interest 
rates remain low by hist
orical standards. Recent 
equity market turbulence was short-lived. Although 
short-term bank interest rates have increased 
substantially, ECB interest rates have not been fully 

passed through, as regards both short-term and 
especially long-term bank interest rates. All in all, 
financing conditions remain favourable. 
Financial markets widely exp
ect that in the near term 
the ECB will pursue its policy of progressively 
withdrawing monetary stimulus and further 
normalising interest rates. At present, financial market 

prices imply that a high probability is being given to 
at least one further ECB rate increase by 25 basis 
points in the course of 2007.  
Household sector credit growth is decelerating, 
driven by a slowdown in mortgage lending 
On the back of rising interest rates, high and rising 
indebtedness and the solid house price gains of recent 

years, household sector funding demand is easing. 
The annual growth rate of bank lending to the 
household sector in the euro area declined from 

roughly 10% in March 2006 to a still robust growth 
rate of about 8% at the beginning of 2007. Over the 
same period, the growth rate of mortgage lending  

decelerated from more than
 12% to around 9%. The 
year-on-year growth rate in mortgage lending (which 
accounts for more than 70 percent of all outstanding 

household loans) has slowed down in almost all euro-
area countries and most not
ably in Ireland, Greece 
and the Netherlands.  
In the fourth quarter of 2006, the ratio of outstanding 
household debt to GDP in the euro area reached a 
record high of 59% of GDP. The combination of high 
debt levels and rising interest rates, particularly at the 
short end, has implied an increase in household net 
interest payments (i.e. the difference between 

payments received on bank deposits and interest 
payments due for loans) vis-à-vis banks. Net interest

payments in the euro area are estimated to have 
exceeded 2.3% of GDP in th
e fourth quar
ter of 2006, 
slightly up from just above 2.1% of GDP during the 
year 2005. 
While household debt levels and debt-servicing costs 
in the euro area as a whole remain low in an 
international context, the situation varies significantly 
across Member States. Countries where variable-
interest-rate contracts are widespread are likely to be 
affected more strongly, as
 household balance sheets 
are more vulnerable to the rising trend in short-term 
interest rates. Household sector debt levels vis-à-vis 
banks in those countries range from 40% to 80% of 

GDP, namely 41% in Greece, 46% in Finland, 74% in 
Portugal, 77% in Spain and 80% in Ireland. 
In addition to rising short-term interest rates, a 
cooling down in housing markets could have 

implications for highly-indebted households. House 
price increases in the euro ar
ea softened from 7.9% in 
2005 to 6.4% in 2006, the 
lowest price increases since 
2001. Additional evidence of a cooling down in 
housing markets is provided by a slowdown in 
residential building permits in a number of euro-area 

countries. A slowdown in housing demand together 
with the progressive rise in debt-servicing costs for 
variable-rate mortgage holders suggest that the 

outlook for household balance sheets is likely to 
deteriorate in a number of Member States. 
Outside the euro area, lending to households 
continued to be buoyant in most EU countries. In the 
beginning of 2007, lending to households increased 
Chapter 2 
The economic situation in the euro area and the EU 
- 25 - 
by roughly 10% year-on-year in the UK, Sweden and 
Denmark. When measured against GDP, household 
sector debt exceeds 100% in Denmark, is close to this 

threshold in the UK and amounts to 70% in Sweden. 
Household sector credit growth is also very strong in 
most new Member States, amounting to more than 

50% year-on-year in the 
Baltic countries, about 35% 
in Poland and roughly 30% in Hungary, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia. Nevertheless, despite its rapid 

rise, the amount of debt outstanding in relation to 
GDP remains relatively low in the new Member 
States.  External funding in the corporate sector has 
remained buoyant Demand for external funding within the corporate 
sector has been buoyant throughout 2006 and into 
2007. As net issuance of equity has been relatively 

modest, funding demand is being met primarily 
through borrowing. While bond issuance has been 
rising, the growth in bank lending to the corporate 

sector accelerated sharply to
 more than 13% year-on-
year in January 2007 Œ a record high Œ before slowing 
down to 12.6% in February
. The euro-area countries 
with the highest rates of non-financial corporate 
sector credit growth were Spain and Ireland with year-

on-year growth amounting to about 30%, while in 
Germany credit growth was a mere 3.4%. 
Amid the revival in corporate borrowing, the ratio of 
corporate debt to GDP incr
eased from 64% at the end 
of 2005 to 70% at the end of 2006, while the net 
interest burden vis-à-vis banks rose from 1.5% of 
GDP to more than 1.8% of GDP over the same period.

for working capital. Banks reported that M&A 
financing and corporate restructuring contributed to 
additional demand for external funding by corporates. 

The survey does not prov
ide information on the 
relative importance of each factor in determining total 
loan demand. 
In non-euro area countries, lending to the non-
financial sector advanced rapidly as well. In 2006, 
credit growth to the non-financial corporate sector 
increased by roughly 15% in the UK and in Denmark 

and by about 10% in Swed
en. In the new Member 
States, bank lending to the non-financial corporate 
sector varied widely, with growth rates of more than 

50% in Estonia and Latvia, at the one extreme, and 
more moderate rates of around 10% year-on-year in 
Hungary and Poland, at the other.

Box 2.1:
 New methodology for in
terest rate assumptions
 With the spring 2007 interim forecast, interest rates 
assumptions were for the 
first time altered from a judgemental approach to a market-based approach. With this 
change, the set of external assumptions (oil prices, exchange 
rates and interest rates) is 
now fully market-based. As a 
result, the consistency of the Commission forecast's external 
assumptions has been improved. 
For the euro area, short-term 
interest rates are derived from 
future contracts, while long-te
rm interest rates are derived 
from implicit forward swap rates. The latter are corrected for 
the actual spread between the 10-year government bond 
yield and the 10-year swap rate. 
None of the interest rate assumptions have been corrected for 
risk premia which would raise technical difficulties and 
would not be straightforward as
 there is no single optimal 
methodology. 
For the other Member States, both short- and long-term 
interest rates are derived from 
implicit forward swap rates, 
following the methodology for the euro area described 
above. In cases where no market 
instruments were available, 
a fixed spread vis-à-vis euro area interest rates was taken for 
both short- and long-term interest rates.  
To shield the assumptions from daily fluctuations, 10-
working-days averages were used. The cut-off date for 
interest rate assumptions was 18 April 2007. 
3. Continued brisk growth 
- 27 - 
A better starting point combined with stronger 
underlying momentum 
Due to better-than-expected activity in the second half 
of 2006, average annual output growth was revised 

upwards for the year as 
a whole compared to the 
autumn forecast. At the same time, the statistical 
overhang for GDP into 2007 increased to 1.2% for 

both regions, compared to projections of 0.9% for the 
euro area and 1.0% for the EU in the autumn. 
Furthermore, survey data suggest that the better 

momentum at the end of last year was carried over 
into 2007. The forecast th
erefore raises quarterly 
growth in 2007 to an average rate of around 0.6% 

QoQ in both regions, from 0.5% in the autumn 
forecast. The most sizeable revision 
to the quarterly growth 
profile in 2007 was made for the first quarter, where 

the euro-area economy is now
 expected to grow by 
0.6% QoQ rather than 0.
2% as projected in the 
autumn (similar revisions were made for the EU as a 

whole). This large revision mainly stems from a much 
higher growth rate for Germany, where GDP growth 
for the first quarter is now projected to be +0.6% QoQ 
instead of -0.9%. The revisi
on for Germany is partly

due to the VAT rise having
 a weaker impact than 
earlier assumed. Exceptionally warm weather  

conditions in the first quarter also boosted 
construction activity. Above all, the underlying 
growth momentum proved significantly stronger.    
Owing to these revisions, real GDP growth in 2007 is 
forecast at 2.6% in the euro
 area and 2.9% in the EU, 
up by 0.5 pp. compared to the autumn 2006 
projections. In 2008, GDP growth is expected to 

decelerate slightly to 2.5% 
in the euro area and 2.7% 
in the EU. This nevertheless represents an upward 
revision by 0.3 pp. for both areas. With growth in

  Economic forecast, spring 2007 
- 28 - 
2008 remaining robust, 
annual average growth 
between 2006 and 2008 will 
reach 2.6% in the euro 
area and 2.9% in the EU, the best three-year period 

since the 1998-2000 boom.  
The underlying fundamentals supporting economic 
activity over the forecast period are still-robust 
external demand, accommodating financial conditions 

(mainly due to continued low long-term interest rates) 
and a broadly steady inflation environment reflecting 
persistent competitive pressures of globalisation, 

greater credibility of monetary policy and stabilising 
commodity prices. These fa
vourable fundamentals 
have translated into sustained upbeat business and 

consumer survey results. In March 2007, after a 
moderation at the turn of the year, economic 
sentiment registered new heights in almost all sectors, 

approaching the values at 
the peak of the 1998-2000 
boom.  
Growth relies on domestic forces 
The improved outlook as co
mpared to the autumn 
forecast reflects a stronger 
growth contri
bution from 
domestic demand in both 2007 and 2008. This is 
partly offset by a less supportive impulse from the 

external side (specifically 
for the euro area). The re-
composition of activity towards domestic demand, 
particularly private consumption, is likely to benefit 
growth in the services sect
or. This should compensate 
partly for the expect
ed slowdown in the 
manufacturing sector stemming from a weakening 

global manufacturing cycle. 
Private consumption growth 
is projected to accelerate 
over the forecast period, to
 reach 2.4% in the euro 
area and 2.6% in the EU by 2008. The contribution of 

private consumption to GDP 
growth in the euro area 
will rise from 1.0 pp. in 2006 to 1.4 pps. in 2008 
(from 1.3 to 1.5 pps. in the EU). These figures are 

encouraging but not exceptional and they should be 
seen in perspective as they remain clearly below the 
values registered during the period 1998-2000. 
Several factors are behind the improved outlook for 
private consumption, in particular rising labour 
income combined with a d
ecline in consumer price 
inflation. Labour income will be underpinned by 

robust employment growth and a steady progression 
of real compensation per employee (the growth rate of 
which is projected to rise from close to zero in 2006 o 

above 1% in 2008). As suggested by rising optimism 
among consumers, these favourable factors are likely 
to outweigh the adverse im
pact of a tighter fiscal 
stance in some of the larger Member States.

Graph 2.8: 
The saving rate, euro area
trend
Consumer confidence surpas
sed its long-term average 
at the end of 2005 and is gradually heading for the 
peak values reached in 2000. 
In 2006, private consumption was also supported by a 
drop in the households saving rate, which returned to 
the historical minimum value recorded in 2000. The 
forecast assumes a stable saving rate over the period 

2006-2008. Since the saving rate has followed a trend 
decline over the longer-term Œ due to factors such as 
demographic changes, easier access to credit and 

lower interest rates Œ the forecast thus takes a cautious 
stance with regard to private consumption growth. 
This may be justified by the fact that the labour 

income component of households™ disposable income 
is growing sub par despite its acceleration over the 
forecast period, while concerns about the 

sustainability of social security systems in many 
Member States may have led households to increase 
their precautionary saving. 
Investment strength: more to come 
Since 2004, investment in equipment has been the 
fastest growing component of domestic demand. The 
forecast expects this to continue also during 2007-
2008, despite a certain easing over the projection 
period. In fact, growth is expected to weaken already 
in the course of 2007, but the annual growth rate for 

2007 is boosted by a large carry-over from 2006. As a 
result, the annual growth rate of equipment 
investment in 2007 is projected to rise to 5.9% in the 

euro area, from 5.5% in 2006, before slowing down to 
4.9% in 2008.

Graph 2.9: 
Capacity utilisation rate and investment in 
                    equipment, euro area
forecast
 The strength of equipment investment is underpinned 
by robust domestic and external demand, continued 
high, albeit somewhat moderated, earnings 

expectations by corporates, accommodating financing 
conditions and the 
recent steep rise in the capacity 
utilisation rate in manufacturing. In line with this, 

bank lending to non-financial corporations continued 
to expand rapidly throughout 2006 to reach an annual 
growth rate of 13.2% in January 2007 (a slight 

deceleration to 12.6% was noted in February). 
Additionally, the ECB™s January 2007 bank lending 
survey shows that loans for fixed investment have 

become the most dynamic component of bank lending 
in the euro area afte
r M&A and corporate 
restructuring. Furthermore, the European 

Commission™s latest investment
 survey indicates that 
the extension of the production capacity has become 
the dominant investment motive, followed by the need 

to replace an ageing capital stock.  
Equipment investment will therefore remain a key 
driver of growth over the forecast horizon, even 
though the recent 
increase in indebtedness and the 
still-preponderant weight of bank loans in total 
liabilities of the corporate sector makes companies 

sensitive to further increases in interest rates. 
Construction investment has also been revised 
upwards in the euro area, to 3.3% in 2007 (up from 
1.7% in autumn) and to 2.7% in 2008 (up from 2.3%).

factors similar to those that support equipment 
investment. Public construction investment, which has 
been sluggish in past years as a result of fiscal 

consolidation and slow growth, is projected to see a 
pick-up reflecting the increased room for manoeuvre 
provided by the recent im
provement in government 
finances. By contrast, housing investment is set to 
ease during the forecast pe
riod. This slowdown is 
suggested by data on loans to households for house 

purchase which have decelerated since the second 
quarter of last year. Rising borrowing costs and the 
adjustment process which 
has become necessary in 
Member States where real estate markets have been 
very dynamic in recent years are the main factors 
behind this slowdown. 
The area-wide decline in the growth of construction 
investment over the forecas
t period (from 4.5% in 
2006 to 2.7% in 2008 in the euro area) masks varied 
developments across Member States. The slowdown 

is most pronounced for some of the EU15 countries, 
with Denmark, Greece, Ireland and Sweden being 
particularly affected. In Germany, construction 
activity is also projected to
 slow down noticeably in 
2007 since part of the investment has been brought 

forward to 2006 in anticipation of the VAT hike. By 
contrast, among the recently-acceded Member States 
construction investment is expected to hold up well in 

general, and to accelerate ev
en further in some of 
these countries.  
Declining support from the external side 
Export prospects, as reported in manufacturing 
surveys, are still at a record high. However, the 

international environment is set to become somewhat 
less supportive for EU exporters in the quarters to 
come. This is due to the softening of the global 
economy, combined with th
e lagged effects of the 
euro appreciation. Furthe
rmore, the pick-up in 
domestic demand also boosts import growth. The 
impulse from net exports to growth is therefore 

projected to weaken over 
the forecast period. In the 
euro area, the impulse fro
m the external sector 
declines by a total of 0.3 pp. over the forecast period 

(from +0.3 pp. in 2006 to 0.0 pp. in 2008), while in 
the EU the growth contribu
tion decreases by less but, 
as it starts from a lower level, turns negative from 

2007 on (+0.1 pp. in 2006; -0.1 pp. in both 2007 and 
2008). 
For the euro area,
 the projected export deceleration 
results from a less dynamic external environment 

combined with a slightly larger loss of market share 
than in 2006. The latter is mainly due to Germany, for 
which the exceptional market share gains observed in 

2006 (+3.5%) are expected to normalise (+1.3% in 
2007; 0.0% in 2008). Exports seem fairly resilient to 
exchange rate developments at the aggregate level. 
Within the euro area, the export performance 
continues to diverge over the forecast period, from 

substantial market share loss
es for Ireland and Italy, 
to market share gains fo
r Germany and Slovenia. 
While price competitiveness is an important element 

in explaining such differences, other factors such as 
the product mix in terms of quality and price elasticity 
also seem to play a certain role. 
Related to the divergence in export performance is 
Member States' divergence
 in current accounts Œ 
which is broadly in balance in the EU and the euro 
area as a whole. Large and growing deficits are, in 

particular, projected for 
some of the catching-up 
economies, with the highes
t values topping 20% of 
GDP. The use of external savings can play an 

important role in facilitating income convergence, 
especially if capital comes in the form of foreign 
direct investment.  However, persistent sizeable 

current account deficits can raise concern about 
sustainability, particularly if investment and 
productivity growth are low and capital inflows are 
directed into consumption or 
real estate or if external 
borrowing is at levels that could trigger financial 

stress. Chapter 2 
The economic situation in the euro area and the EU

Box 2.2:
  Some specificities behind the forecasts
 The cut-off date to take new 
information into account when 
preparing this macroeconomic outlook was 23 April 2007. 
External assumptions This forecast is based on a set of external assumptions. These 
assumptions reflect the market expectations at the time of the 
forecast. To shield the assumptions from possible volatility 
during one specific trading day, averages from a 10-day 
reference period have been used for exchange and interest 
rates as well as for oil prices.  
Exchange
 rates
 The technical assumption as regards exchange rates has been 
standardised using fixed nominal exchange rates for all 
currencies. They are kept constant based on the averages 
from 3 to 18 April. This technical assumption leads to 
implied average USD/EUR rates of 1.33 in 2007 and 1.34 in 
2008, and average JPY/EUR rates of 158.9 in 2007 and 
160.0 in 2008. 
Interest rates 
Interest rate assumptions are now market-based instead of 
judgemental as it was the case in the autumn 2006 forecast. 
Short-term interest rates for the euro area are derived from 
future contracts. Long-term intere
st rates for the euro area, as 
well as short- and long-term in
terest rates for other Member 
States, are calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the spread between the 3-month interbank 
interest rate and the 3-month swap rate. In cases where no 
market instrument is available, a fixed spread vis-à-vis euro- 
area interest rates is taken for both short- and long-term 
rates. As a result, short- and long-term interest rates are at 
4.1% on average in 2007 and 4.2% in 2008 in the euro area. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity prices are also forecast taking into account 
market conditions. In the case of
 oil prices special attention 
is paid to futures prices. Prices
 for Brent oil are, accordingly, 
projected to be 66.2 USD/bl
 in 2007 and 70.3 USD/bl in 
2008. Prices of primary commodities, excluding fuels, are 
assumed to increase by 13.7% in 2007 and to decline by 
0.6% in 2008.  In 2007, the prices of all groups excluding 
fuels are expected to increase compared to 2006. 
Chain linking In order to improve the accur
acy of GDP growth estimates, 
National Accounts have moved 
to ‚chain linking™ in most 
Member States to incorporate more up-to-date price weights. 
Chain-linking uses previous year™s
 prices (instead of prices 
from a given base year) which are then ‚chained™ together. 
Budgetary data 
Data for 2006 are based on governme
nt debt and deficit data 
transmitted by Member States to the European Commission 
in April 2007. In publishing these data, Eurostat has 
amended the deficit and debt 
data reported by Belgium for 
2005 and 2006, and more marginal
ly the deficit for Portugal 
(2005) and the United Kingdom (2003-2006). Eurostat is 
currently verifying the revised Greek GDP series. The 
Commission continues to use the unrevised GDP series, also 
provided by the Greek authorities, for analytical and 
administrative purposes until 
this verification is complete. 
For 2007, budgets adopted or presented to parliaments and 
all other measures known in sufficient detail are taken into 
consideration. For 2008, the "no-policy change" assumption 
used in the forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and 
expenditure trends and the incl
usion of measures that are 
known in sufficient detail. 
The general government balances reported by Member States 
to the European Commission may be slightly different from 
those published in the national accounts. The difference 
concerns settlements under swaps and forward rate 
agreements (FRA). Accord
ing to ESA95 (amended by 
regulation n°2558/2001), swaps and FRA-related swaps are 
financial transactions and therefore excluded from the 
calculation of the government 
balance. However, for the 
purposes of the excessive deficit procedure, those flows are 
still booked as interest.  
According to a Eurostat decision of 2 March 2004, funded 
defined-contribution pension sche
mes should be classified in 
the financial sector by April 2007. Three Member States (i.e. 
Denmark, Poland, and Sweden), which benefited from a 
transitory period as reported in the autumn 2006 forecast, 
revised their net lending an
d general government debt 
accordingly at the end of this period. 
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output gaps 
The number of working days may differ from one year to 
another. For example, 2004 was a leap year with 2.8 
additional working days compared to the average number of 
working days. This translated into an estimated impact of 
0.24 pp. on the GDP growth rate for the euro area. For 2005 
and 2006, the effects were negative of around -0.1 pp. each 
year, while it is estimated to
 be close to neutral in 2007. 
Annual GDP figures are not adjusted for the number of 
working days, while quarterly figures mostly are. The 
calculation of potential growth and the output gap does not 
adjust for working days. Since it
 is considered temporary, it 
should not affect the cycl
ically-adjusted balances. 
4. Robust labour market performance 
- 32 - 
European labour markets continued to improve in 
2006 in line with the projections in the autumn 
forecast. With employment growing at a healthy pace 

and unemployment rates falling rapidly, the labour 
market has moved into a strong recovery phase, 
adding significantly to the picture of a generally 

brighter outlook for the EU economy. 
Robust employment growth in 2006 
On the back of the pick-up in economic activity in 
2006, employment grew by 1.4% in the euro area and 
1.5% in the EU, up by 0.6 pp. on the previous year in 

both areas. This was the strongest increase in 
employment since 2000. Euro-area employment 
growth picked up markedly in the first half of 2006, to 

an annualised 2% QoQ, slowing down somewhat to 
1.2% in the second half of the year.  
The improvement in 2006 was broad-based across 
sectors. While a large bulk 
of all new jobs was created 
in the private services sector, more positive 
developments were also registered in industry in some 
Member States, where employment had previously 
fallen for a number of years. 
In addition, the employment content of growth has 
increased in some Member St
ates. This is likely to be 
due notably to the increased share of services in EU 
economies, to structural reforms in some Member 
States, but also to increasingly differentiated types of 

employment (e.g. an increasing share of part-time 
employment).  
Employment expectations
 still pointing up 
On the basis of survey data up to April 2007, 
expectations still indicate sustained employment 

growth going forward. Employment prospects as 
reported in the Commission's business and consumer 
surveys (BCS) sugg
est that employment creation will 
continue into the second half of the year. The 
employment component of the Purchasing Managers' 
Index is at its highest in six years. 
Employment outlook for 2007-08 
Employment is foreseen to grow by 1.4% in 2007 and 
1.2% in 2008 in the euro 
area, which represents an 
upward revision of 0.2 pp. for 2007 and 0.1 pp. for 
2008 compared to the autu
mn forecast. For the EU, 
the forecast points

of 1.4% in 2007, 
and 1.1% in 2008 (+0.4 pp. and +0.1 pp., respectively,

compared to the autumn forecast). Employment 
growth is thus projected to
 decelerate only slightly 
between 2006 and 2008, due to economic activity that 
is set to remain above potential. Spain, Germany, 
Poland, Italy and France will contribute most to the 

nearly 5.5 million jobs which the EU is expected to 
create in 2007 and 2008 (3.8 
million in the euro area). 
Employment and participation rates improve– 
Robust employment growth in 2006 assisted in raising 
the employment rate to 64.4% in the euro area and to 

64.3% in the EU, up from 
63.5% and 63.4% the year 
before. Over the forecast period, the employment rate 
is projected to increase further to settle at 65.9% in 
the euro area and 65.6% in 
the EU in 2008. Despite 
this increase, the employment rate remains low by 

international standards, pointing to a persistent under-
utilisation of the EU's
 labour potential.  
This under-utilisation of the labour force becomes 
even more striking in the light of participation rates in 

the euro area. In 
2005, for instance, the participation 
rate was 69.5% compared to a rate of above 75% in 
the US. Nevertheless, it improved by 0.4 pp. in 2006 

and is forecast to increase by a further 0.8 pp. over the 
forecast period. Moreover, in some countries, in 
particular in Spain, it has increased substantially while 

it already stands above 
75% in Denmark, the 
Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and the United 
Kingdom.

balance
 –due to structural reforms and composition 
effects 
The rise in the participatio
n rate in recent years is 
partly due to structural reforms. In particular, pension 
reforms in a number of Member States have started to 

produce effects by increasing the age of exit from the 
labour force. On top of this, the ageing structure of the 
workforce together with 
cohort effects (as baby 
boomers move into the older worker bracket) may 
have contributed to the fact that the participation rate 
of older workers (55-64 years of age) has increased 

most rapidly in the past few years.  
Above-average increases in
 the labour force have 
been observed in Spain, Ir
eland, Austria, and to a 
degree also in the UK and It
aly, which likely reflect 
recent immigration and 
the regularisation of 
undeclared workers in addition to a rising female 
labour participation. 
Finally, more flexible labour markets have seen the 
share of part-time and fi
xed-term contracts soar, 
especially in Spain, Germany,
 and Italy. Such atypical 
contracts constitute the bulk (around 60%) of all jobs 
created in the EU and thei
r share in total employment 
could rise further. 
Drop in unemployment rates–  
The harmonised unemployment rate has been on a 
continuous downward trend since the second half of 
2004, when it peaked
 at 8.8% in the euro area (9% in 
the EU). For 2006 as a wh
ole, the unemployment rate 
averaged 7.9% in the euro area and in the EU. In

forecast
March 2007, the unemployment rate declined to 7.2% 
in the euro area 
(7.3% in the EU), 
compared to 8.2% 
in both regions a year earlier. 
 –especially in some of the larger Member States 
In the euro area, this perf
ormance in 2006 was driven 
by the larger Member Stat
es. Compared with 2005, 
the unemployment rate in Germany fell markedly by 
1.1 pps., while Italy and the Netherlands also saw falls 

of 0.9 pp. and 0.8 pp., respectively, and the Spanish 
unemployment rate dropped by 0.6 pp. At the EU 
level, the improvement in 2006 was also due to an 

impressive decrease in the unemployment rates in 
Poland (by almost 4 pps.) and in some of the smaller 
EU Member States. 
However, differences remain. The unemployment 
rates among euro-area Member States ranged from 
around 4% in the Netherlands to around 9½% in 
France for 2006 as a whole. 
While the drop in the unemployment rate is largely 
attributable to the strong 
cyclical upswing, there is 
also evidence pointing to a 
reduction in the structural 
unemployment rate. Estimates by DG ECFIN using 

the NAWRU concept (i.e. the unemployment rate 
below which inflationary pressures coming from the 
cost side are theoretically kicking in) suggest that the 
structural unemployment rate fell to about 7½% in 
2006, from around 8% in 2004-2005. 
 
 
 Economic forecast, spring 2007 
- 34 - 
Further decline in unemployment ahead 
With output growth staying firm, unemployment is 
projected to drop further ov
er the forecast period, to 
7.3% this year and 6.9% next in the euro area and to 

7.2% and 6.7%, respectively, in the EU. These are 
rates unseen since the beginning of the harmonised 
unemployment series in 1993. This represents a fall of 

2.5 million in the number of unemployed persons in 
the euro area and 4.8 milli
on in the EU between 2005 
and 2008.  
Estimates point to a further decline in the structural 
rate of unemployment in 2007-2008, but at a 
somewhat lower speed than the actual rate of 
unemployment. As a consequence, on current 

estimates the actual unemployment rate will fall 
below the structural rate by 2008.      
Wage rises to accelerate moderately 
Throughout Europe, labour markets are expected to 
become tighter over the forecast period. So far 

though, real wages have lagged behind by around 5 
pps. in the current recovery compared to past 
upswings. Real wages in the euro area have grown at 
a negative rate (-0.1%) during the current recovery 
compared to an average grow
th of +0.3% in the past 
four recoveries. Wage moderation in the euro area in 
the past three years has been
 driven first and foremost 
by wage developments in Germany. For the euro area 

as a whole, the annual 
growth rate in real 
compensation per employee stood at -0.1% in 2005 
and 0.1% in 2006, dragged down by strongly negative 

growth rates in Germany, as well as in Spain and the 
Netherlands.  
Looking ahead, real wage growth is projected to edge 
up somewhat as new wage agreements are expected to 

reflect the better economic outlook and the increase in 
the growth of labour productivity. However, such 
developments are likely to remain moderate, 

particularly in 2007, as, due to the staggered nature of 
wage agreements, this process will take some time. 
Overall, for the euro ar
ea, real compensation per 
employee is forecast to rise
 by 0.6% in 2007 and 1.0% 
in 2008. For the EU, the corresponding values are 
0.8% in 2007 and 1.3% in
 2008. The fo
recast thus assumes that wage moderation will continue over the 
forecast horizon.  98100

 Will structural factors keep a lid on real wages? 
Comparing the projected unemployment rate with the 
estimated structural rate suggests that by 2008 euro-
area labour markets could face wage pressures. 
However, the estimate for the structural 
unemployment rate depends on a number of 

parameters which are subject to change over time. For 
this reason, the structural unemployment rate could 
well decline faster than 
expected, as has already 
happened in the past, thereby helping dampen 
potential upward wage pressures. As reforms and 
structural factors may k
eep a lid on real wage 
developments, this cycle could denote a structural 
break from the historical pattern of wage formation. 
Therefore, although th
e unemployment rate is 
projected to fall sharply 
over the forecast horizon, 
ongoing structural changes in the labour market 
together with pressure from 
low-cost countries (due to 
globalisation) suggest that unemployment could still 
fall further without generating wage inflation. 
Moreover, developments in individual Member States 
have been very different in recent years and much will 

depend on where increases in wages occur. For 
instance, real wage growth 
is expected to range from 
0.0% in Germany to 2.6% in Slovenia in 2007. In the 
recently acceded Member Stat
es, the catch-up process 
is generally triggering higher-than-average wage 

growth. In some Member 
States, anecdotal evidence 
suggests bottlenecks and labour shortages, notably in 
the Netherlands, where th
e increase in real 
compensation per employee should accelerate 
strongly compared to 2006,
 and possibly feed into 
inflation. Also in Spain, where the labour force has 
Chapter 2 
The economic situation in the euro area and the EU

been growing sharply, due in part to immigration 
trends coupled with larg
e increases in female 
participation, tensions related to labour supply could 

appear.  
Labour productivity still firming 
Real wage increases have to be assessed also against 
the acceleration of productivity
 growth in 2006, which 
had a dampening effect on unit labour costs. 

Compared to the previous four economic recoveries 
and notwithstanding recent positive developments, a 
productivity gap of around 1½% nevertheless 

remains. Consequently, further increases in the near 
term seem likely. 
Labour productivity growth (measured in output per 
person) will stay firm going into 2008 in the euro area 

(1.3% in 2006, 1.2% thereafter) and increase in the 
EU (from 1.4% in 2006 to 1.5% in 2008). Such 
growth is distinctly faster than the longer-term 

average (below 1%). Whether the acceleration in 
actual labour productivity reflects at the same time an 
improvement in the underlying trend is debatable. 
Only developments over the course of the next few 
years will allow for a proper assessment of whether 

this recent improvement is su
stainable. A simple trend 
extraction using standard 
methods (see chart) shows 
some evidence of an interruption of the downward 

trend of labour productivity growth at the turn of 2003 
and, subsequently, of a mild pick-up. 
Among the larger Member States, particularly high 
productivity gains are expected in Germany (with an 

upward revision of +1 pp. in 2007 and +0.5 pp. in 
2008 compared to the autumn
 forecast). In the cases

of Germany and Italy, these strong increases in 
productivity clearly dampen growth in unit labour 
costs. Despite harmonised wage indicators pointing to a 
pick-up compared to past wage restraint, due to the 

strengthening of labour productivity competitiveness 
indicators continue to signal a relatively healthy 
competitive position at the aggregate level. Real unit 

labour costs in the euro area and the EU are still 
declining and, despite some headwinds, export 
performance is set to be vigorous.  
Overall, it seems that the cyclical upswing has 
positively affected European labour markets. Both the 
cyclical and the structural part of unemployment have 
declined across coun
tries. Differences in the structural 
rate of unemployment remain, however.

5. Inflation developments and outlook 
- 36 - 
Euro-area headline inflat
ion remained below 2% 
since last autumn – 
Headline HICP inflation in the EU has remained well 
contained since the autumn. Following a period of 

nearly 12 months when it fluctuated around 2½%, 
annual inflation dropped markedly in the autumn, 
reaching a low of 1.8% in 
the EU and 1.6% in the 
euro area in October. The drop reflected a 
combination of favourable ba
se effects and declines in 
oil and energy prices. Inflation has since drifted up 

somewhat, fluctuating closely around 2% in the EU, 
while it remained below that threshold in the euro 
area, despite the VAT increase in Germany on 

1 January 2007. This marked the first time since 1999 
that the euro area has regi
stered a period of seven 
consecutive months with inflation below 2%. 
Developments in oil and energy prices had a strong 
impact on the short-run inflation dynamics. After 
running at two-digit levels during the first half of last 
year, energy price inflat
ion in the euro area 
decelerated markedly to 1½
% in September 2006, and 
energy prices even declin
ed in October (-0.5%), 
reflecting the strong easing of oil prices in those 
months. Following a mild rebound at the end of the 
year, energy price infla
tion decelerated again to 
around 1-2% in the first months of 2007. The sharp 
decline over the last few months turned the 
contribution of this component to headline inflation 

from about 1 pp. in the first half to 2006 to 0.1 pp. in 
the first months of 2007. This decline was an 
important element behind the relatively muted overall 

inflation outturns at the beginning of 2007.  
Inflation in the other main non-core component, i.e. 
unprocessed food, also eased recently. Due to adverse 
weather conditions last summer this component 

exerted upward price pressure in the final months of 
2006. As this pressure abated, inflation in 
unprocessed food in the eu
ro area declined from 4½% 
last September to just below 3% in March 2007. 
 –while core inflation picked up somewhat 
In contrast, euro-area core
 inflation (HICP excluding 
energy and unprocessed food) recently edged up to 
almost 2%, after hovering 
around 1½% for nearly two 
years. As a consequence, the wide gap observed over 
the last two years between headline and core inflation 

has closed.

 The rise of core inflation can be traced mainly to 
developments in the services component, which 
increased by 0.3 pp. in January 2007, interrupting a 
period of about a year with 
inflation steady at around 
2%. Most of the increase can be attributed to 
developments in Germany, where services inflation 
was affected by the increase 
in the standard rate of 
VAT in Germany from 16% to 19% in January 2007. 
Developments in the two other main core inflation 
components were somewhat different. There was an 
up-tick in the annual rate of price increases in 

processed food last October, mainly due to an 
increase in tobacco prices in
 Germany, in anticipation 
of the VAT hike. Since then, inflation in this 
component has been steady at around 2%, not much 
different from the inflation rates observed earlier last 

year. On the other hand, inflation in non-energy industrial 
goods continued on the gentle upward trend started in 
mid-2005, reflecting the gradual pass-through of past 

increases in oil and non-oil commodity prices. 
Inflation increased by 0.4 pp. from last autumn in this 
component, to stand at 1.2% in March 2007.  More 

aggressive seasonal discounting in January than in 
previous years in several Member States, particularly 
in clothing and footwear, appears to have offset to 

some extent the impact of the German VAT hike on 
this component of core inflation. Overall, official 
estimates indicate that the German VAT increase 

added about 1 pp. to national inflation, including 
anticipation effects.  This me
ans a 0.3 pp. effect at the 
euro-area level. However, there is still some

uncertainty regarding the final price impact, and 
lagged effects might still materialise later this year. 
Looking at developments at the production stage, 
there are still some signs of pipeline inflationary 

pressures despite the continued easing of the headline 
index. Overall industrial pr
oducer price inflation (PPI, 
excluding construction) in 
the euro area fell from a 
peak at 6% (y-o-y) last July to just below 3% in 
February 2007. This was mainly the result of the 
sharp decline in the energy component, which 

plunged to 1% in February 2007, from close to 15% 
last July. At the same time, inflation in industrial 
consumer goods, the most immediately relevant 

component for consumer pri
ces, decelerated by about 
½ pp. from its 2.0% peak in August 2006. However, 
the picture is less favourable in the other non-energy- 

related components. In particular, the annual rate of 
price increases in intermediate goods, the largest 
component of the index, declined only marginally 

since the autumn, and is stil
l at an elevated level (6% 
in February 2007). 
On the side of labour costs, as mentioned in the 
previous section, the overall picture remains one of 
continued moderation. The annual growth rate in 
compensation per employee in 
the euro area eased to 
1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2006, from 2.4% in the 
previous quarter. This strong decline was to a large 
extent driven by some country-specific temporary 

developments. For the year as a whole, compensation 
per employee is estimated to have grown by 2.2%, 
after 1.9% in 2005.  This suggests the absence of 

significant second-round effect
s, so far, from the past 
oil price rise. Other labour cost indicators also point to 
only a modest acceleration in the course of last year. 
The ECB's indicator of negotiated wages moved up 
from 2.0% in the fourth quarter of 2005 to 2.4% in the 

fourth quarter of 2006. However, this indicator 
showed noticeable volatility 
throughout the year due 
to the effects of temporary factors, making it difficult 

to interpret quarterly developments. On average, 
negotiated wages in the euro area grew by 2.2% in 
2006, compared with 2.1% in 2005. The annual 

growth rate in Eurostat's hourly labour cost index 
shows a slight acceleration in the first half of 2006 
followed by a slowdown in the second half, ending 

the year at 2.5%, unchanged from the same quarter in 
the previous year. The continued moderation in wage 
growth is remarkable as it takes place against a 

brisker pace of economic growth. 
The rebound in labour productivity in 2006 meant that 
the slight acceleration of wage growth had no 
inflationary impact. It is estimated that productivity in 

the euro area rose by 1.3% 
in 2006, more than double 
the average gains of the last
 four years. Accordingly, 
growth in unit labour costs is estimated to have eased 
from 1.3% in 2005 to 0.9% in 2006. 
On the side of inflation expectations, short-term 
inflation expectations in the euro area, based on the 

Commission's consumer surveys, almost reached a 
five-year high in November 2006, but have since 
declined continuously, posting values somewhat 

below their historical aver
age since February 2007. 
After increasing somewhat at
 the end of last year, 
long-term inflation expectations in the euro area 

derived from French government inflation-indexed 
bonds declined slightly to 2.14% in March, from 
2.15% in December. 
A benign inflation outlook at the aggregate level 
Looking ahead, average annual HICP inflation in the 
euro area is projected to d
ecline from 2.2% last year 
to 1.9% this year, and to remain unchanged at that 
level in 2008. In the EU, inflation is expected to 

decline from 2.3% in 2006 to 2.2% this year and to 
2.1% in 2008. Compared to the autumn, the new 
projections entail a slight downward revision for 2007 
(0.2 pp. for the euro area and 0.1 pp. for the EU), 
reflecting lower energy price inflation in the first 

months of this year. For 2008, the inflation projection 
is unchanged for the euro area and revised up by 0.1 
pp. for the EU. 
Economic forecast, spring 2007 
- 38 - 
In terms of quarterly profiles, inflation is now 
expected to increase much more moderately in the 
euro area in the first quarte
r of 2007, comp
ared to the 
autumn (a 0.1 pp. increase, 
compared to an increase of 
0.4 pp. in the autumn). Further on, inflation is 
projected to decline marg
inally, before picking-up 
somewhat at the end of the 
year. This pattern reflects 
in part base effects ste
mming from the energy price 
developments of last year. A similar, but less 

pronounced patter is expe
cted in the EU, where 
inflation should remain at, or just above, 2.0%. 
The new inflation projection is supported externally 
by reduced inflationary impulses from commodity and 

import prices and domestically by continued 
moderation in unit labour cost gains, despite the 
strong cyclical momentum. The annual rate of 

increase in total primary co
mmodity prices (including 
fuels) is assumed to fall sharply from over 20% last 
year to about 3.0% at the 
end of the forecast period. 
Excluding fuels, prices of primary commodities are 
actually set to decline by roughly ½ pp. in 2008. 
Meanwhile, the annual rate
 of increase of import 
prices is projected to ease from 4½% in 2006 to 
somewhat below 1½ % in 2008. 
On the domestic side, growth in nominal unit labour 
costs in the euro area is expected to accelerate from 
0.8% in 2006 to 1.6% in 2008. This profile is 
explained chiefly by the 
projected acceleration by 
about ½ pp. in compensation per employee over the 
forecast horizon (to 2.8% in
 2008), while productivity 
gains remain unchanged (at 1.2%). The acceleration 

of wage growth appears to be in line with the 
maturing cyclical position 
of the euro area and the 
tightening labour market. The euro-area 

unemployment rate is foreseen to decline to below the 
NAWRU in 2008, when unemployment should reach 
6.9%, the lowest rate since the early 1990s. At the 
same time, the (negative) output gap is projected to 
nearly close by the end of the forecast horizon. 
Inflation prospects differ across Member States 
At the level of Member States, the largest downward 
revisions for 2007 among euro-area countries have 

been registered in Germany, Spain, France and the 
Netherlands. Inflation in Germany, is now projected 
to edge up marginally this year (to 1.9%), before 

easing to 1.7% in 2008.  However, the new projection 
for 2008 represents a 0.5 pp. upward revision 
compared to the autumn. 
Excluding the VAT hike, 
underlying inflation in Germany is thus set to pick up 
over the forecast horizon.  Inflation in France is now 
set to fall to 1½% this year, before edging up to 1.7% 

in 2008. Inflation in the Netherlands should also ease 
this year to 1½%, before rising to about 2% in 2008. 
In Spain, inflation is ex
pected to decelerate more 
sharply in 2007 (by 1.2 pps., to 2.4%), reflecting inter 
alia stable growth of comp
ensations, before increasing 
somewhat in 2008. 
Outside the euro area, in
flation for 2007 has been 
revised up sizeably in four countries, which also 
happen to display some of the highest inflation rates 

in the EU: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Hungary. Of 
these countries, inflation is projected to decline in 
2008 only in Latvia and Hungary. Romania, one of 

the two countries that joined the EU this year, is 
expected to record a declin
e in inflation from 6½% in 
2006 to 4½% in 2008. In the other non-euro area 

Member States, inflation was generally revised down 
in 2007, compared to the autumn. Among the larger 
non-euro area Member States
, inflation in the UK is 
expected to ease in 2008 to 2%, while it should 
increase to 2½% in Poland.

6. Public finances 
- 39 - 
A further improvement in the budgetary situation 
In 2006, public finances in the EU benefited from a 
significant economic upturn, as well as the sharp 
recovery in tax elasticities, particularly reflecting 

corporate tax buoyancy, that
 started in 2005. Starting 
with the headline figures, 
the budget deficit for the 
euro area in 2006 was at 1.6% of GDP, down from 

2.5% in 2005. Based on the usual no-policy-change 
assumption, the deficit is forecast to remain on a 
declining path in the fo
llowing two years reaching 
1.0% in 2007 and 0.8% of GDP in 2008. A broadly 
similar picture is expected 
for the EU27 as a whole, 
with a deficit set to decline from 1.7% of GDP in 

2006 to 1.2% in 2007 and 1.0% in 2008.  
Compared to the autumn
 forecast, the current 
estimates point to a better-than-expected outturn in 
2006, which by and large carri
es over in the forecast 
years 2007 and 2008.    
The more favourable public finance outcome for 2006 
mainly reflects better-than-expected revenues 
compared to the estimates made in the autumn: in the 
euro area, revenue growth was revised significantly 
upward (from 4.8% to 6.1%) against a marginal 

upward revision of expenditure growth. Broadly 
similar revisions took place for the EU27 as a whole.   
The revenue-to-GDP ratio 
in the euro area should 
decline gradually from 45.7% in 2006 to 45.4% in 

2008 (and similarly for the EU27, from 45.2% to 
44.8%). With significantly more favourable GDP 
growth prospects than earlier assumed (especially in 

2007), this reflects tax elasticities returning to a more 
normal level as well as tax reductions in a number of 
countries. The expenditure ratio is expected to decline 

from 47.3% of GDP in 2006 to 46.2% in 2008 in the 
euro area, and from 46.9% to 45.8% for the EU27 as a 
whole, largely due to unchanged trends in expenditure 

growth against higher-than-earlier-assumed GDP 
growth.  
In structural terms (i.e. corrected for cyclical factors 
and net of one-off and other temporary measures), the 

budgetary adjustment in 
the euro area between 2006 
and 2008 is more muted than the nominal 
improvement (from a structur
al deficit of slightly 
above 1% of GDP in 2006 to ¾% in 2008), in view of 
the narrowing, though still negative, output gap. A 

similar pattern can also be observed for the EU27 as a 
whole, with a cyclically-adjusted deficit moving from

Euro area: deficits fall below the 3%-of-GDP 
threshold but the structural improvement is muted 
At country level, the projected improvement of public 
finances in the euro area seems to reflect a relatively 
broad-based trend throughou
t the forecast period.  
For countries currently in the excessive deficit 
procedure (EDP), the 2006 outcomes confirm that the 
deficit has been brought below the 3% of GDP 
threshold in both Greece and Germany, and in the 
case of the latter by a much larger margin than 
previously expected. A better-than-expected reduction 

of the deficit was also achieved for Portugal and Italy 
(net of a large deficit in
creasing one-off). This is 
expected to be broadly car
ried over in the forecasts 
for 2007 and 2008. By 2007, only Portugal is 
expected to present a defic
it above 3% of GDP and, in 
the absence of further measures, this would still be the 

case in 2008.  
Among the other euro-area countries, Ireland and 
Spain are projected to significantly reduce their 
surplus. The small surplus posted by the Netherlands 

in 2006 is forecast to turn into a 0.7% of GDP deficit 
in 2007, before a move to a balanced budget in 2007. 
A gradual reduction of the deficit - to close to 2% of 

GDP at the end of the forecast
 period - is expected for 
France.  
 Economic forecast, spring 2007 
- 40 - 
In structural terms, the limited improvement foreseen 
for the euro area results from substantially different 
developments at country level. Broadly in line with 

the improvement in the nomin
al balances, structural 
balances are expected to strengthen over the forecast 
period in Belgium, Germany, Greece, France and 

Italy. In Ireland and Spain, 
the structural deterioration 
reflects continued projected strong growth of 
expenditure. Strong expenditure growth is also the 

main cause of the structural deterioration in the 
Netherlands in 2007, where expenditure overruns are 
expected against the backgr
ound of rapidly improving 
cyclical conditions.  
Against the background of overall limited 
improvement in the structur
al balances in the euro 
area, including examples of
 pro-cyclical loosening, 
Finance Ministers meeting in the Eurogroup of 20 
April 2007 committed 
"to pursue more ambitious 
budgetary targets than those set in the 2006 Stability 

programmes ... using unexpected extra revenues to 
reduce government deficit and debt...
 " and to 
"design 
fiscal policy plans for 2008 so as to accelerate 
adjustment towards the medium term objective (MTO) 
for Member States which have not reached it, and for 

those which have reached it, to avoid feeding 
macroeconomic imbalances overall".
 Uneven budgetary performances outside the euro 
area Outside the euro area, conc
erning countries currently 
in EDP, the outcome for 2006 confirms that the deficit 
is brought below 3% for Malta and the United 
Kingdom. Better-than-expected deficit outcomes were 

observed in Hungary and Poland, which also carry 
over into 2007 and 2008. As a result, the projected 
deficit improves particularly for Hungary (by 4.3 

percentage points between 2006 and 2008), while in 
the case of Poland the de
ficit approaches the 3% 
threshold towards the end of the forecast horizon. 

Following a deterioration in 2006, in Slovakia the 
deficit is projected to fall below 3% of GDP from 
2007 onwards. By contrast, after a temporary 
improvement in 2006, the deficit in the Czech 
Republic increases again to close to 4% of GDP in 

2007, before diminishing slightly in 2008.   
As regards the other countries, Bulgaria, Estonia, 
Denmark and Sweden continue to present sizeable 
surpluses throughout th
e forecast period (although 
significantly declining in the case of Bulgaria), while 
Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania are also expected to 
remain well below the 3%-of-GDP deficit threshold. 
On the other hand, based on current information and 

under the usual no-policy-change assumption, the 
deficit in Romania is forecast to rise from 1.9% of 
GDP in 2006 to above 3% of GDP from 2007 

onwards.   
In structural terms, the deficit is likely to deteriorate 
significantly between 2006 and 2008 in Romania and 
the Czech Republic (reflecti
ng in the latter country the 
absence of overall improvement together with 
improving cyclical conditions). A structural 
deterioration, but starting from a strong surplus 

position, is also expected in Bulgaria. A large 
improvement in the structural
 balance is expected for 
Hungary. Smaller improvements occur in Estonia, 

Malta, Poland and the United Kingdom.

  Chapter 2 
The economic situation in the euro area and the EU 
- 41 - 
Debt continues its downward trend 
In the euro area the debt ratio continues its decline 
that started in 2006. Between 2006 and 2008, it is 
projected to fall by 4 pps. to 65% of GDP. A broadly 

similar development is forecast for EU27, where the 
debt ratio is now expected to fall below the 60% of 
GDP reference value already in 2007. 
The downward trend is shared in varying degrees in 
all euro area countries, exce
pt for Portugal where the 
debt is expected to increas
e slightly. Compared to the 
autumn forecast, the debt projections for most 

individual countries were revised downward in each 
of the forecast years.   
Outside the euro area, th
e main exception to the 
general downward trend in government debt is 

Hungary, where on the back of high deficit 
projections the debt is pr
ojected to increase from 
66.0% of GDP in 2006 to 68.1% in 2008. 

Nevertheless, compared to the autumn forecast this is 
still a sizeable downward revision. Smaller increases 
are expected for the Czec
h Republic, Lithuania, 
Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom.

7. Risks to the forecast 
- 42 - 
Summing up, the economic outlook in the EU and the 
euro area is for a continuation of robust growth above 
potential with a slight deceleration of economic 

activity later in the forecas
t period, in line with the 
moderate slowing of the global economy and the 
progressive withdrawal of monetary stimulus. 

Inflationary pressures are expected to remain 
moderate in 2007, but as the cycle matures and labour 
markets tighten wage pressures may emerge towards 

the end of the forecast period.     
Risks to the growth forecast stem from both domestic 
and external factors. In 2007, an upside risk is related 
to domestic demand which could turn out more 

buoyant than projected. In 
particular, the favourable 
labour market developments may give a further boost 
to consumer confidence, th
ereby unleashing some of 
the pent-up demand that accumulated during this 
cycle of unusually restra
ined consumer spending. 
While, in the near term, this could probably only be 

realised through a fall in the households saving rate Œ 
the forecast being based on a broadly stable saving 
rate Œ this would simply mean that the saving rate 
would continue its decline of past years, following its 
sharp rise after the bursting of the dot-com bubble. A 

decline in households' saving relative to disposable 
income would be particularly plausible in countries 
with major fiscal retrenchment programmes since 

inter-temporal optimisation by consumers would 
suggest that the effects 
on real consumption are 
spread over a longer time period. More generally, 

recent progress in fiscal consolidation and substantial 
reforms of social security systems in many Member 
States over the past years may have raised confidence 

in the longer-term sustainability of public finances 
which could induce consum
ers to adjust their 
precautionary savings downwards.  
Beyond the near term, the turnaround in the labour 
market could boost labour income by more than what 
is factored into the forecas
t, particularly if labour 
productivity continues to surprise on the upside. 

Higher household incomes would trigger higher 
household spending which in turn would foster 
employment growth, eventually turning this upswing 
into a durable, domestical
ly-led recovery. In the 
current framework of a stable macro-economic policy 

environment supported by a more credible monetary 
policy there is a non-negligible probability of such a 
ﬁGoldilocksﬂ-scenario materialising.  
Risks also pertain to invest
ment spending in 2007, in 
particular for construction. The substantial carry-over 
from 2006 and the warm weather in the first quarter 

skew the risks for the growth of construction 
investment in 2007 slightly to the upside. However, 
going forward downside risks for construction activity 

are getting larger, due in particular to housing 
investment. House price inflation has started to slow 
down in those Member States where price rises in past 

years have been most pronounced. With borrowing 
cost on the rise, some households with variable-
interest-rate mortgages may face increasing 

difficulties in repaying their housing loans. In addition 
to the effects this would have on consumer spending, 
in cases of defaults banks may repossess houses and 

put them back on the market
, thereby adding to supply 
and thus to the downward pressure on prices. While 
for most countries concerned a soft landing is the 

most likely scenario, a more sizeable downscaling of 
construction activity is inevitable in those countries 
where the share of the construction sector in the 
economy has swollen significantly beyond the longer-
term average. 
Risks are also related to developments in financial 
markets. The recent episode of equity-market 
turbulence in February-March has once more 
demonstrated the heightened sensitivity of investors to 

adverse developments in the global economy. As the 
equity market has again stabilised, the turbulence may 
have been simply a technical correction, following a 

period of steady gains since mid-2006. It could, 
however, also be the prelude to a normalisation (i.e. a 
sustained increase) in global risk aversion going 

forward, contributing to a more normal pricing of risk. 
Against the background of highly leveraged balance 
sheets of households and companies, such a 

deterioration in macro-financial conditions could feed 
back into real-sector activ
ity in the EU economy via 
reductions in the level of investment and household 

spending. 
A further downside risk to the baseline scenario 
already identified before is a more pronounced 
slowdown in the US economy. Recent US economic 
data have sent rather mixed signals. While activity in 
the services sector remains 
strong, there are signs of 
weakening in the manufacturing sector. Consumer 
confidence appears to have 
been negatively affected 
by higher short-term interest rates and a cooling in the 

housing market. Most importantly, rapidly rising 
Chapter 2 
The economic situation in the euro area and the EU 
- 43 - 
default rates in the sub-prime mortgage market have 
resulted in a serious credit crunch in this market 
segment and have disturbed the market for 

collateralised debt obligations. The problems in the 
sub-prime mortgage market have not extended to the 
high-quality segments of the mortgage market so far. 

If this were to happen, the implications for US 
mortgage lending and the housing market more 
generally could be serious, with inevitable knock-on 

effects on the profitability of the US banking sector 
and the performance of the broader economy.  
The possible implications of a stronger-than-expected 
downturn in the US eco
nomy for global economic 
growth and, more specifically, for the EU economy 
were discussed in more detail in the autumn 2006 
forecast. An additional aspect 
of this discussion is that 
a sharp US economic slowdown could also bring 
global imbalances back into focus. Concern about a 
disorderly unwinding of global financial imbalances 

has eased in recent months, as the distribution of 
growth across the global economy has become more 
balanced. However, the more optimistic view of a 
gradual rebalancing in the international financial 
system has been predicated
 on expectations of a 
moderate US economic slowdown, accompanied by a 
sustained recovery in Europe and continued strong 
growth in Asia. If the US economy were to slow 

sharply, however, the pattern of growth in the global 
economy of recent months would be severely 
disrupted. This could act as a catalyst for a 

normalisation of risk aversion in the financial markets 
and, possibly also an abrupt unwinding of financial 
imbalances globally. The negative implications of 

such a scenario for exchange rates, trade and 
eventually financial stability could be far-reaching.  
Oil prices have been on the rise recently due in part to 
renewed geo-political tensions. In the absence of a 

solution to these conflicts and given continued strong 
demand growth, upside risks to the oil price 
assumption are likely to outweigh downside risks. 

While the economy has so far weathered the strong 
rise in oil prices since 2003 surprisingly well, it 
cannot be excluded that, at some stage, a further rise 
in the oil price level would also have a significant 
negative impact on the real economy.  
Oil prices also seem to be the most important risk to 
the inflation outlook in the short term. Beyond the 
near term, resource constraints in the EU economy,

particularly on the labour market, may put upward 
pressure on prices although this may be balanced to 

some extent by competitive pressures from 
globalisation and/or by stronger productivity gains. 
Taking everything together, risks to the growth 
outlook for the EU and the euro area appear broadly 

balanced in 2007 but, with risks form the external side 
becoming more prominent, tilted to the downside in 
2008. This is depicted in Graph 2.19 which provides a 

quantification of the above-presented risk assessment 
in terms of possible deviations from the central 
scenario. The chart shows the impact various 

combinations of risks could have on euro-area GDP 
growth, the outcomes being weighted by the 
probability of their occurrence. At a 90% confidence 

interval, GDP growth in the euro area could be, in the 
extreme case, up to 0.4 pp. higher or lower in 2007, in 
line with the assessment of balanced risks. In 2008, 
risks to the forecast become
 more pronounced and at 
the same time skewed to the downside. Taking again 

the 90% confidence interv
al, euro-area GDP growth 
could be up to 0.6 pp. higher in the event of a 
confluence of positive factors, but also as much as 

0.8 pp. lower if only negative factors materialise.

Forecasts
Activity in 2006 
Economic activity in 2006 turned out to be stronger 
than anticipated, resulting in annual GDP growth of 
around 3%.  
Domestic demand was the main driver of economic 
growth in the first half of the year. Private 
consumption benefited from increasing real household 
disposable income, mainly because of the 

implementation of the final stage of the 2001 personal 
income tax reform but also due to higher employment 
growth. After correcting for 
real estate sales by the 
federal government (recorded as negative 
investments, but with no impact on economic 
activity), gross fixed capital formation was boosted by 

high public investment in the run-up to local elections 
in October (see graph), and by a continued high level 
of corporate investment (aft
er a year of exceptionally 
high investment growth in 2005). Export growth is 
picking up after a period of significant losses in 
market share, although for 
2006 as a whole it remains 
below the growth in imports. Therefore the 
contribution of net exports to GDP growth was still 
(slightly) negative.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Economic growth is expected to stabilise at above  
0.5% on a quarterly basis, resulting in an annual 
growth rate of 2.3% in 2007 and 2.2% in 2008.  
Now that the personal inco
me tax reform has been 
fully implemented, household real disposable income 
growth is expected to return to  more moderate 
growth levels. Nevertheless, increased employment in 
the wake of the sound economic growth in 2006 and 
relatively strong wage developments continue to 
support fairly robust private consumption expenditure. 

The household savings rate is expected to settle at 
above 13%.  
Investment expenditure is 
forecast to slow down in 
2007, in particular due to a stabilisation of investment 

in inventories (after a year of exceptional growth in 
2006) and by lower public investment. Excluding the 
one-off effect related to the government's real estate 

sales, the latter is expected to return to its trend level 
as a percentage of GDP after the 2006 local elections, 
a pattern observed also in the past. The anticipated 

slowdown in household disposable income combined 
with rising interest rates is exerting downward 
pressure on housing investment, which is expected to 

slow down after buoyant growth in 2006.  
After a couple of years of significant losses of market 
share, the strengthening of export growth in the 
second half of 2006 seems to point to some degree of 

recovery. For 2007 and 2008 Belgian exports are 
forecast to grow more in 
line with the import markets 
of the main trading partners. Although imports are 
expected to follow exports closely, external demand is 
expected to make a positive contribution to GDP 

growth of almost 0.3 percentage points in both 2007 
and 2008, after two consecutive years of a negative 
contribution. A strong euro should also support some 

improvement of the terms of trade as well as an 
increase in the external bala
nce of goods and services.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Strong economic growth in 2006 and high business 
confidence result in robust employment growth. This 

also implies a decrease in unemployment, although 
the impact is partly offset by a growing labour force. 
Wages are expected to acceler
ate in 2007 and 2008 in 
view of the more favourable labour market conditions, 
also following similar  developments in Germany and 
the Netherlands.  
After reaching 2.3% in 2006
, HICP inflation is likely 
to moderate to around 1.8% in 2007 and 2008, 
supported by favourable import price and exchange 
rate developments. Although in 2006 inflation as 
measured by the national CPI was significantly lower 
than HICP inflation (due to a revision of the national 

CPI), it is expected to follow a pattern similar to 
HICP inflation in 2007 and 2008.

  Public finances 
Public finances in 2006 benefited from the higher-
than-anticipated economic growth, in particular 
through indirect tax revenue. Higher revenue from 

one-off measures compensated the loss in direct 
income tax revenue related to the final stage of the 
personal income tax reform. The 2006 government 

accounts thus recorded a small surplus.  
The better-than-anticipated outcome for 2006 partially 
carries over to 2007. Reduced public investment (after 
the local elections in 2006) and lower interest 

expenditure, combined with some new revenue-
increasing measures, are planned to replace a 
substantial package of one-offs (over 0.8% of GDP) 

from the 2006 budget. However, a new tax on packing 
material (with an initially planned revenue of 0.1% of 
GDP in 2007 and 0.2% in 2008) turned out to be 

difficult to implement and 
its expected impact was 
downsized considerably during the latest budget 
control exercise. The forecast further includes the 
one-off effect of the adva
nce collection of social 
contributions on holiday allowances and a first 
package of real estate sales (about 0.2% of GDP). 
Further one-off measures have been announced (some 

0.3% of GDP, in particular a second round of real 
estate sales and the take-over of pension funds), but 
are not included in
 the projections, because they are 
not yet sufficiently specified. Overall, a deficit of 
around 0.1% can be expected for 2007. As for 2008, 
on a no-policy-change basis, a slight deterioration of 

the deficit to around 0.2% of GDP is forecast, mainly 
due to the expiry of the one-off measures in the 2007 
budget (retained in the 
forecast), which is only 
partially compensated by a reduction of interest 
expenditure.  
The debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to remain on a 
downward path, falling from 89.1% to 82.6% in 2008.

 % of GDP
Forecast
 %Activity in 2006 
Real GDP growth remained robust in 2006 at around 
6%, mainly driven by strong domestic demand. 
Relatively strong employment growth and higher real 

incomes continued boosting private consumption, 
which increased by around 
7½%, up from about 6% 
in 2005. On the back of very high FDI inflows of 

above 16% of GDP, gross fixed capital formation 
remained buoyant and increased by around 17½% in 
2006. The composition of growth remained fairly 

unbalanced with a strong negative contribution from 
net exports, mainly because
 of high import growth 
and lower exports of services. 
Merchandise export growth picked up again in 2006, 
but remained below import growth. As a result, the 
trade deficit widened further to around 21½% of 
GDP. A decrease in the su
rplus of the services 
balance (due to lower growth of tourism revenues), 
lower current transfers and lower net incomes from 
abroad further added to the increase in the current 

account deficit. Net borrowing 
vis-à-vis the rest of the 
world thus increased to around 15% of GDP in 2006, 
up from around 11% in 2005. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Underlying economic trends are expected to remain 
largely unchanged in 2007 and 2008, with real GDP 
growing at around 6% in both years. The catching-up 

of the Bulgarian economy will continue to be 
supported by strong investment growth, both to 
expand capacity and to upgrade the existing capital 

stock. Moreover, absorption of EU Structural Funds 
starting in 2007 will give a boost to investment in 
public infrastructure. 
Noticeably higher real wa
ge growth (backed by 
productivity gains) and sustained job creation will 
imply a gradual increase in disposable incomes and 

thus private consumption growth in the coming years. 
At the same time, some fiscal expansion over the 
forecast period could lead to
 somewhat higher growth 
in public consumption than has been the case in 2006. 
Final demand will therefore continue to expand 
strongly at rates of around 9% per year. In line with 
robust domestic demand, imports are expected to 

outpace exports despite a gradual strengthening of the 
export potential of the Bulgarian economy which is 
reflected in persistent gains in market shares. The 

trade deficit is thus expected to widen to above 22% 
of GDP in 2007 and 2008. 
The current account deficit 
will further increase as a result of higher repatriated 

profits weighing on the income balance. Stronger 
current and capital transf
ers from the EU will, 
however, imply that the net borrowing of the 

economy will stabilise at around 15½% of GDP over 
the forecast period. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Strong private sector job creation, which was also 
boosted by a reduction in pension contributions, and 
an increase in participation rates led to higher-than-
expected employment growth of around 2½% in 

2006. Thanks to an increase in participation rates, 
relatively solid employment growth of above 1% per 
year is expected over th
e forecast period despite a 
drop in the working-age population due to negative 
demographic trends. The unemployment rate is 
projected to fall further, to around 7½%, in 2008. 
An increasingly tight labour market will entail certain 
upward pressures on nominal wage growth. However, 
in line with a substantial increase in the investment 
ratio and ongoing economic restructuring, labour 

productivity is projected 
to accelerate steadily from 
around 3½% in 2005 to 5% in 2008. This will 
mitigate the effect of the increase in wages on 

nominal unit labour costs. 
HICP inflation increased from
 an average 6% in 2005 
to 7.4% in 2006, mainly owing to higher excise duties 

on alcohol and tobacco. Thanks to lower oil prices 
HICP inflation decreased during the year, but 
seasonally higher food pr
ices caused a slight re-

 acceleration to 6½% at the end of the year. In 2007, 
inflation is expected to decline to around 4¼% on 
average thanks to lower oil 
prices and because of the 
base effect of the excise
 duty increase in 2006. 
Somewhat higher oil prices and some upward 
pressure from wage developments could, however, 

imply slightly higher inflation in 2008. Real unit 
labour costs are expected to remain more or less 
stable over the forecast period. 
Public finances 
The general government surplus reached 3¼% of 
GDP in 2006, up from around 2% of GDP in 2005. 
Strong revenue growth and improved tax collection 
limited the effect of the 6-percentage-point reduction 

in pension contributions in 2006 on the revenue-to-
GDP ratio. At the same time, expenditure restraint Œ 
especially as regards current primary spending Œ and 

lower interest payments helped reduce the 
expenditure-to-GDP ratio by almost 3% of GDP. 
Reductions in corporate and personal income tax rates 
in 2007 are expected to le
ad to a decrease in the 
revenue-to-GDP ratio despite further improved 

revenue collection and compliance. The forecast also 
takes into account the re-allocation of part of the VAT 
revenue to the EU budget 
after accession, Bulgaria™s 
contribution to the EU budget and higher capital 
expenditures. A fiscal expansion is thus expected in 
2007. The general government budget surplus will be 

reduced to around 2% of GDP in 2007 and remain at 
this level in 2008 on a no-policy-change basis. 
In line with strong GDP growth and fiscal surpluses, 
general government gross debt is expected to drop to 

below 20% of GDP in 2008.

 % of GDP
Activity in 2006 
The Czech economy continued to grow strongly in 
2006, at about 6% of GDP, equalling the record level 
of 2005. The main impetus was provided by domestic 

demand, in particular gross fixed capital formation, 
with a declining contribution from net exports.  
Growth in gross fixed capital was driven by strong 
inflows of mainly export-oriented foreign direct 

investment and boosted by an increase in EU funds 
for infrastructure development. Private consumption 
also rose strongly on 
the back of increasing 
employment, rising salaries, cuts in direct taxation 
and expanding consumer credit. Mortgage lending 
also grew rapidly helped by low interest rates. The 

increase in consumer spending contributed to a strong 
rise in imports which reduced the contribution of net 
exports. On the supply side, the main contribution to 

the economic expansion continued to come from 
manufacturing, particularly 
transport related, as well 
as trade and commercial services.   
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The exceptional growth of the previous two years is 
expected to moderate in 2007 and 2008 to just below 
5% of GDP while the pattern 
of growth is expected to 
stay broadly similar. Domestic demand should 
provide the greater stimul
us whereas the growth 
contribution of the external balance is likely to be 

partly affected by an ap
preciating koruna. Private 
consumption expenditure is pr
ojected to rise at above 
4%. Household and corporate borrowing is likely to 

continue growing rapidly while remaining moderate 
compared with euro-area le
vels. Investment is still 
expected to provide the main impetus based on new 
measures to encourage domestic investment, a 
stronger injection of EU funds and a buoyant housing 

market. The construction sector has started to show 
robust growth which is set to continue through 2007.  
The trade balance is set to continue to register a 
surplus, despite increasing mineral prices, with 

continued strong export growth in the automobile and 
high-technology sectors. Net 
borrowing is forecast to 
fall slightly while continuing to reflect a large 

proportion of repatriated and reinvested profits from 
foreign investment. This is partly due to higher 
transfers which will be boos
ted by an increase in EU 
funds from 2007 onwards.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market should further tighten in 2007 due 
to continuing firm growth 
in the Czech economy, with 
improving employment opportunities expected in 

most sectors. While private sector salaries are 
expected to respond to the tightening labour market, 
public sector wages are likely be more restrained. 
Overall, due to rising 
productivity real unit labour 
costs are forecast to continue falling. The potential 

impact of the increase in the minimum wage level in 
2006 on employment should be partially 
counterbalanced in 2007 
by changes to benefit 
entitlement criteria that will encourage more active 
job seeking. However, structural factors, in particular 
the relatively high tax wedge on labour, still temper 

long-term employment growth.  
The two rises in excise duties in 2007, and the pre-
announced hike in electricity prices at the beginning 
of 2008, are expected to add to inflationary pressure 

while the overall outlook should also be mitigated by 
falling real unit labour costs. Inflation is predicted to 
rise through 2007 and 2008 to just below the 3% 

target of the CNB.  
In March, the CNB announced a downward revision 
of the inflation target to 2%, effective from January 
2010. In spite of the revision of the CPI basket at the 

beginning of 2007 which will reduce measured 
inflation by up to a third of a percentage point, the 
move may imply monetary tightening given the 
overall outlook.

 Public finances 
The government deficit fell  to  2.9% of GDP in 2006, 
well below the annual target of 3.8% of GDP set out 
in the consolidation path of the July 2004 Council 

Recommendation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure 
(EDP). However, this is mainly due to stronger 
growth than previously anticipated rather than 

sustainable spending cuts.   
The budget for 2007, which was agreed upon before 
the election of the new government, implies a 
pronounced fiscal expansion,
 mainly due to increases 
in social expenditure estimated at over 1% of GDP, 
without significant cuts in other areas, again 
overshooting the medium-term expenditure ceiling.  
Based on the outturn in 2006, the 2007 budget and the 
medium-term budgetary outlook for 2007/2008, the 
forecast is for a deficit of 
3.9% of GDP in 2007 and 
3.6% of GDP in 2008. This will imply a marked 

divergence from the target in the 2004 EDP 
consolidation path of 3.3% of GDP for 2007, as well 
as significantly increasing the likelihood of missing 
the deficit target of 2.7% of GDP in 2008, the 

correction year in the curre
nt EDP, despite the likely 
benefit of higher-than-anticipated revenues. This is 
based on a broadly positive macroeconomic scenario, 

an increased injection 
of EU funds, and the 
expectation that the share of
 public consumption as a 
percentage of GDP will fall. It also assumes the 

stabilisation of the use of reserve funds, in line with 
government policy, which have been estimated to 
have accumulated to about 2% of GDP. 
The government debt ratio is projected to increase 
steadily to about 31% of GDP by 2008.

Activity in 2006  
In 2006, economic activity maintained its momentum, 
with real GDP growth reach
ing 3.2%, slightly higher 
than in 2005. Private consumption continued to be the 

main driving force and grew by 3.4%. This was 
supported in particular by the ongoing increase in 
employment, a strong housing market and still 

relatively low interest rates. Investment provided a 
further impetus to the economy and grew overall by 
about 11%. Both export and import growth 

accelerated further in 2006.
 Due to buoyant private 
consumption, high capacity utilisation in the domestic 
economy and a prominent im
port content in exports, 
imports grew more than exports, resulting in a 
negative growth contribution of net exports.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Over the forecast period, th
e economy is expected to 
keep on growing at a h
ealthy pace, but somewhat 
more slowly than in recent years. A slowdown in 
economic activity already 
became visible in the 
second half of 2006, with real GDP growing by only 
0.3 and 0.4% in the third and fourth quarter (quarter-
on-quarter). The main reasons for the slowdown are 

widespread capacity constraints in the domestic 
economy and a moderation in private consumption. 
Overall GDP growth is foreseen to decelerate to 

respectively 2¼% and 2% in 2007 and 2008.  
Private consumption is expected to moderate as 
interest rates increase and as the housing market cools 
off. After sharp price hikes for one-family homes in 

the past two years of about 20% a year, the rate of 
increase slowed down marked
ly in the second half of 
2006. In the fourth quarter, prices stagnated overall. 
While prices have shown a tendency to fall in areas 
where the earlier price increases have been most 

pronounced and a general price fall cannot be 
completely disregarded, there are currently few signs 
of a major forthcoming correction in real estate prices. 

Nonetheless, the housing market remains a downside 
risk to the economic outlook.  
Investment is expected to 
slow down over the forecast 
period, partly due to higher interest rates and a 

slowdown in housing construction. However, capacity 
utilisation at a very high level, widespread labour 
shortages and good profitability in the private sector 

are expected to provide a continued impetus to 
business investment.  
Given the capacity pressure in the economy, imports 
are expected to continue to 
grow somewhat faster than 
exports this year and to contribute negatively to 
growth.  Only in 2008 is growth of exports and 
imports expected to balance as domestic demand 

growth should ease further. 
Overall, the projected scen
ario for the slowdown of 
GDP growth to below potential, with a moderation of 

domestic demand and a cooling of the housing 
market, is set to ease the pr
essures on the economy. It 
should ensure that hea
lthy economic growth is 
maintained, albeit at a lower level.  
Labour market, cost and prices 
In 2006, the labour market continued to strengthen. 
Employment increased further and unemployment fell 
to a historically low level well below 4% of the labour 

force. At the same time, capacity utilisation is 
persistently high in the industrial sector and most 
sectors are reporting shortages of labour. 
Nevertheless, the increase in wage growth has so far 
been rather limited in the overall economy. Looking 
ahead, however, wage growth is eventually set to 
accelerate, judging from th
e outcome of the 2007 
wage negotiation round. The current indications seem 
to point to wages rising at a rate about 1.5-2% per 
year faster over the next three-year period than in the 
previous period.  
Domestically determined inflation has gradually been 
increasing due to higher cost pressures, albeit from a 

very low level. Consumer price inflation has therefore 
remained subdued and slightly below the euro-area

average. Over the forecast pe
riod, capacity constraints 
and growing wage pressures in the economy are 
expected to result in upward pressure on inflation in 

2008. At the same time, counter-effects from lower 
energy prices should contribute to maintaining 
consumer price inflation just under 2% in 2007.  
Public finances  
In 2006, the general government recorded a sizeable 
surplus 4.2% of GDP (taking into account the 
reclassification of second-pillar funded pension 
schemes in the private sector as from April 2007). The 

strong public finances are partly a consequence of 
healthy economic growth and a fall in unemployment, 
implying higher tax revenue and lower transfer 

payments. However, the relatively large surpluses are 
also due to certain windfall 
revenues. Notably, energy 
prices that have remained at a high level resulted in 

strong tax revenue from the oil and gas activities in 
the North Sea.  
Looking forward, a moderation in economic growth is 
projected to translate into somewhat lower general 
government surpluses of around 3 ¾ % of GDP in 

2007 and 2008. The projections are however subject 
to major uncertainty due to volatility of certain 
revenues.  
In 2006, the gross debt ratio was reduced to just above 
30% of GDP. Owing to continued strong budget 
surpluses the gross debt ratio is expected to be 
reduced further, to about 20% of GDP in 2008.

Forecast
Activity in 2006 
After several years of sluggish growth, demand and 
output rebounded strongly, attaining a rate of 2.7%, 
the highest since the beginning of the decade. Once 

again, exports were the driving force, rising at double-
digit rates. Nevertheless, growth became more 
balanced, with relative contributions shifting 

somewhat from foreign towards internal demand, as 
both domestic investment and consumption 
strengthened, leading also
 to a pick-up in import 
growth. 
Activity revived sharply as from the beginning of the 
year, and the momentum was largely maintained 
thereafter. Towards the end of the year, demand was 

boosted further by a number of temporary factors. 
Thus, the imminent sizeable VAT increase prompted 
many households to carry purchases forward, notably 

of motor cars and other durable goods, while stable oil 
prices and unusually warm weather helped them save 
on energy cost. The prospect of the VAT increase 

stimulated also construction output; moreover, the 
sector benefited from the abolition of subsidies for 
owner-occupied homes which had led to a boom in 
applications for building permits in late 2005 and now 
translated into higher building activity. On the other 

hand, the front-loading of demand led to a run-down 
of inventories that was exceptionally strong in the 
final quarter. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The VAT increase at the begi
nning of 2007 is leading 
to a demand shortfall corresponding to the purchases 
carried forward into 2006. Th
is is already reflected in 
latest data on new car registrations and retail sales. 
However, the temporary setback should be short-
lived, since the underlying positive trend observed in 

2006 in consumption as well as investment is 
expected to continue in 2007 and beyond. Notably the 
construction sector, where the negative echo effect on 

housing investment was over-compensated by the 
unusually warm weather in the 1st quarter, appears to 
have definitely overcome its decade-long recession 

and should return to a sustainable growth path as from 
the second half of the year
. It will benefit not only 
from higher corporate spending on structures, but also 

from improved public finances, enhancing the scope 
for investment particularly at the local level. 
Corporate investment will keep its strong momentum, 
supported by several factors: the high level of 

capacity utilisation, the completion of balance sheet 
restructuring that has weighed on investment in recent 
years, and the continuous buoyant profit situation. In 

addition, the phasing 
out of the accelerated 
depreciation rules at the end of
 this year should have a 
temporary beneficial effect, followed by a 
corresponding negative echo effect at the beginning of 
2008. Consequently, investment will continue to 

contribute significantly to growth in 2007 and, to a 
lesser degree, in 2008. 
Accelerating growth of dispos
able income as a result 
of an improved labour market situation is supporting a 

revival of consumer confidence. With gains in non-
labour income remaining strong, private consumption 
expenditure is expected to become the main growth 

driver in 2008. 
Chapter 3 
Member States, Germany 
- 55 - 
Despite the expected gradual cooling down of world 
trade, German exports should continue to grow 
strongly, as they are bene
fiting from the country™s 
improved competitivene
ss. The current account 
surplus should increase by nearly a full percent of 
GDP in 2007, partly because imports will be 

dampened by temporary factors such as weather-
related lower energy imports and the VAT-induced 
dampening of domestic demand. Finally, given that 

production grew more steadily than demand around 
the turn of the year 2006/07, enterprises have started 
to replenish their stocks at the beginning of the 

current year. This rebound sh
ould more than offset the 
significant rundown of stocks in the last quarter of 
2006, making a significant positive growth 

contribution. 
In all, GDP growth is set to
 stay robust at a projected 
pace of 2½% each in 2007 an
d 2008, ther
eby raising also potential growth to an estimated 1¾% p.a. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Germany's economic upswing has finally reached the 
labour market. In 2006 the nearly 500 000 new jobs 
created were almost exclusively made up of 

employment subject to social
 security contributions. 
This stands in stark contrast to recent years when 
overall employment remained broadly stable but full-

time employment declined. Given the current strong 
economic trend, enterprises will continue to recruit, 
and total employment is projected to rise further by 

more than 2% in 2007 and 2008 taken together. As a 
consequence, unemployment is expected to fall 
considerably, by around 2 percentage points, until 

2008. This improved situation will induce higher 
wages, mainly in the private sector in 2007 and taken 
up in the public sector in 2008. Nevertheless, 

continued strong increases in productivity will mean 
that unit labour costs will not start to increase until 
2008, and then only slightly. 
More than half of the VAT increase has been passed 
through to consumer prices, partly already in 2006. 
While in January the effect was somewhat smaller 
than expected, albeit also 
masked by lower energy 
prices, inflation data for the months thereafter suggest 
that this process is still ongoing. Nevertheless, as this 

effect is expected to phas
e out quickly, inflation is 
projected to stay below 2% in Germany in 2007 and 
2008, despite higher wages and the expected slight 

increase in commodity prices. 
Public finances 
The general government deficit fell from 3.2% of 
GDP in 2005 to 1.7% in 2006 and hence below the 
3%-of-GDP reference value for the first time since 

2002, and well below the Commission™s projection 
one year ago of a deficit of 3.1% of GDP in 2006. 
The principal contribution to the better outturn comes 
from the revenue side. More favourable cyclical 

conditions led to higher-than-anticipated revenues. In 
addition, direct taxes, especially those related to 
profits, yielded substantially stronger revenues than 

the growth in the tax base would have suggested. As a 
result, taxes as a percentage of GDP increased by 
more than ½ percentage point in 2006 compared with 

2005. The higher tax ratio is thus not the outcome of 
tax policy measures. It is driven rather by payments of 
tax arrears and early payments in direct taxes, thus 

mirroring the relatively low direct tax ratio of the past.  
General government expenditure was kept under 
control in 2006. Total expenditure grew by 0.6%, 
slightly less than projected last spring. With high 
GDP growth, the expenditure-to-GDP ratio fell by 
more than one percentage point. Positive labour 

market developments led to a reduction in related 
expenditure, especially in unemployment insurance 
(Arbeitslosengeld I
). This is administered by the 
Federal Employment Agency, which has continued to 
reduce spending on active labour market policy. The 
higher-than-anticipated revenues were used for deficit 

reduction in 2006, which improved the 2006 structural 
budget balance by almost one percentage point. 
In 2007, the general government deficit is projected to 
fall below 1% of GDP on current policies
i. The increase in the standard VAT rate should boost 
revenues by about 1% of GDP. The pension 
contribution rate was raised from 19.5% to 19.9% and 

public health insurers are expected to increase 
contribution rates on average by ½ percentage point. 
On the other hand, the unemployment insurance 

contribution rate has been reduced from 6.5% to 
4.2%, so that the overall 
social contribution burden 
will decline. Despite the positive economic 
environment, revenue-rich tax bases are developing 
less dynamically than nominal GDP, so that Œ despite 

the increase in the VAT rate Œ the tax burden is 
expected to decline. The expenditure ratio should 
decline by more than one percentage point, reflecting 

public sector wage restraint and reduced labour-

 market-related spending, resulting from measures 
already implemented, such as the reduced benefit 
duration for older recipients, and favourable labour 

market developments. However, public investment is 
projected to pick up, in view of better fiscal positions 
at all levels of government. The cyclically-adjusted 

balance should improve by ¾ percentage point. 
Under the assumption of unchanged policies, 
including social contribution rates, in 2008 the general 
government deficit is projected to decline further, 

albeit entirely due to persis
tent favourable cyclical 
conditions. Lagged consolida
tion effects of measures 
already in force will be more than offset by the 

budgetary burden from 
the reform of company 
taxation amounting to more than 0.3% of GDP.  
Moreover, pension outlays are projected to rise in 
2008, and public sector wage rates by even more. As a 
consequence, no furthe
r improvement of the 
cyclically-adjusted balance is expected in 2008 unless 
additional consolidation measures are adopted. 
The government debt ratio is projected to fall over the 
forecast period, from 67.9% 
of GDP in 20
06 to 63.6% 
of GDP in 2008. As in 2006, below-the-line

 i In March 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that the 
taxation of foreign dividend income in the German tax system in 
force until 2000 was not compatib
le with EU law. Due to 
uncertainties over likely amounts of retroactive reimbursements, an 
impact on the government deficit for 2007 could not be considered 
in these projections. Therefore, the forecast may somewhat 

underestimate the govern
ment deficit for 2007.

Estonia - External balance and components
% of GDP
Activity in 2006 
GDP growth exceeding 11% ha
s continued for a year 
and a half in Estonia, with the outcome for 2006 
reaching 11.4%. Growth was 
driven to a large extent 
by private consumption and investments, which were 
in turn supported by high credit growth, increasing 
employment and rises in real wages and households' 

disposable income. The contribution of net exports 
turned negative with the contribution of exports 
declining due to their slower growth, while imports 

grew level with domestic demand. The contribution of 
the public sector was customarily modest with growth 
rates well below private sector activity. 
External imbalances widened in 2006 with the current 
account deficit above 14% of
 GDP and external net 
borrowing around 12% of GDP. A growing 
merchandise deficit was the main reason behind the 

worsening of the external balance; another factor 
contributing to higher current account imbalances is 
the income account 
with gross reinvested earnings 
reaching 6.5% of GDP last 
year. Gross external debt 
of Estonia continued growing and exceeded 90% of 
GDP at end-2006 with net external debt below 30% of 
GDP. FDI inflow in Estonia continued last year, 
although the main financing inflow took place 

through the banking sector. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
A slowdown in economic growth has been delayed, 
but is nonetheless unavoidable due to constraints in 
supply factors, especially 
labour supply, and the fact 
that investments have been largely made in the real 
estate and related sectors where the market now 
shows signs of having peaked. Recent developments 
confirm that, while demand is still strong, credit 
growth shows signs of moderating and the real estate 

market is gradually cooling down. Thus growth of 
economic activity is expect
ed to decrease from the 
recent exceptionally high levels to more moderate 

annual rates of around 8-9%. 
Growth will continue to be domestic-demand-driven. 
Although the real estate b
oom seems to be receding, 
investment is projected to stay at relatively high levels 

and private consumption growth will not decrease 
notably in 2007 and 2008. The main reasons behind 
buoyant private consumption and investment are still-

high credit growth, rising households' disposable 
income, partly due to further cuts in the personal 
income tax, and wealth effects from higher real estate 

prices. The contribution of net exports to GDP growth 
is projected to be nega
tive throughout 
the forecast 
period despite strong export demand. The external 

deficit will not improve either, as the underlying 
factors Œ strong credit grow
th and associated import 
demand, partially due to the continuing catching-up 
process Œ will remain in place. It is projected that the 
current account deficit will remain at levels above 

14% of GDP over the forecast period with a peak in 
2007. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
2006 was an exceptional year
 for the Estonian labour 
market in many respects. Total employment increased 

by over 5% with brisk economic activity bringing 
many discouraged and retired people back into the 
labour market. Persistently high employment growth 

points to a higher-than-expected elasticity of supply. 
Nonetheless there are sign
s of labour shortages in 
certain sectors, in particul
ar construction, with a net 
outflow of labour aggravating these trends.   
The tighter labour market has led to rapidly rising 
wages. This trend is proj
ected to accelerate in 2007, 
as resources of labour dry up, even though the 

demographic situation still remains relatively 
favourable over the forecast period. Rising nominal 
unit labour costs thus constitute a significant risk, 
although there are as yet no
 clear signs of loss of 
competitiveness and there is room for absorbing 

productivity and wage differentials through some 
paring of profit margins.

Annual HICP inflation increased from 4.1% in 2005 
to 4.4% in 2006, mainly reflecting a pick-up in core 
inflation, as well as an incr
ease in food prices in the 
second half of the year due to drought, while the 
contribution of oil prices turned negative at the end of 
the year. Domestic inflationary pressures will remain 

strong in the forecast peri
od due to high economic 
growth and the tightening labour market. Consumer 
prices are projected to incr
ease by over 5% in 2007 
and 2008 with core inflation rising steadily in 2007 to 
the levels of around 5% and remaining high in 2008. 
In 2007 and especially in 2008 consumer prices will 

also be strongly influenced by administrative price 
increases, in particular the 
increase in VAT applied to 
heating scheduled for July 2007, as well as the 

tobacco and alcohol excise increases scheduled for 
January 2008. 
Public finances 
The general government budget surplus reached 3.8% 
of GDP in 2006, mainly due to better-than-expected 
tax revenues and lower-than-budgeted expenditures, 
despite a supplementary budget that was adopted in 

September 2006. The total amount of the 
supplementary budget was 2.5% of GDP, of which 
one third was placed in the pension reserve and the 

remaining part mainly used for investments. The 
budgetary situation is projected to remain sound over 
the forecast period and should help to moderate 

pressures coming from high domestic demand arising 
from the private sector. 
General government debt of just above 4% of GDP at 
end-2006, which is the lowest in the EU, will decline 

further over the forecast period to a level below 3% of 
GDP, as existing debt is repaid. The net financial 
position is already positive with financial assets of the 

general government above 10% of GDP as of end-
2006.

Ireland - GDP growth compared to euro area 
                      and contributions
Activity in 2006 
Economic growth in 2006 was very robust, with real 
GDP growth of 6% over the year, driven mainly by 
domestic demand. Private consumption continued its 

strong performance, supported by solid growth in 
employment and per capita disposable income. 
Growth in investment expenditure slowed down from 

the high pace reco
rded in 2005, as the rebound in non-
residential construction was more than offset by a 
deceleration in housing and equipment investment, 

particularly transport. This
 reflects, in particular, a 
much higher base in the previous year for both 
housing stock investments and equipment (including 

purchases of aircraft). On the external side, 
merchandise export perfo
rmance was relatively 
muted, whereas services exports performed strongly, 

reflecting notably robust growth in business and 
financial services. The growth rate of imports 
decelerated somewhat but 
remained strong, in line 
with the strength of private consumption. Overall, the 
contribution of net exports to real GDP growth was 
just slightly positive.  
The labour market performed very strongly in 2006, 
as employment grew by 4.4%. The construction and 
services sectors accounted for most of this increase, 

whereas the manufacturing sector recorded a fall in 
employment, although this largely reflected a negative 
carry-over effect. A pick up in productivity growth, to 

1.5%, implied a deceleratio
n in the growth of unit 
labour costs, which was however still high relative to 
that of its trading partners. 
The strong growth in domestic demand has been 
reflected in a pick-up of in
flationary pressures. HICP 
inflation rose to 2.7% in 2006, from 2.2% in 2005, 
also a result of adverse energy price developments 

and the relatively high unit labour cost increases. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The Irish economy is expected to continue growing at 
a high rate of around 5% in 2007 and to decelerate to 
4% in 2008. In 2007, domestic demand growth is 

expected to remain very solid, with a further 
acceleration of private consumption growth, 
supported notably by the release of SSIA funds (a 

government-sponsored saving scheme) into the 
economy. In 2008, however, this stimulus will not be 
repeated. Concerning investment, a pick-up in house 

improvements (also stimulat
ed by the SSIA release), 
strong infrastructure and commercial construction and 
a rebound in equipment investment in 2007 are 

together expected to partly offset the impact of the 
easing in new residential construction. In 2008, 
investment growth is projected to slow down, as the 

moderation in housing construction becomes more 
visible. On the external si
de, merchandise exports are 
projected to strengthen somewhat in both 2007 and 
2008, whereas exports of serv
ices should continue to 
perform strongly. Import growth is projected to 

remain strong in 2007 and to moderate in 2008, in line 
with the expected course of domestic demand. As net 
profit outflows are set to remain on an upward trend, 

the implied growth rate of gross national income 
(GNI) is somewhat lower than that of GDP. While the 
most recent data suggest 
that robust growth will 
continue over the short term, risks to this outlook 
persist. In particular, the high reliance of recent output 
and employment growth on the construction sector, 

coupled with the significant increases in household 
indebtedness, are noteworthy risks over the medium 
term; any marked slowdown in the US economy 

would also weigh heavily on the Irish economy. 
Labour market, cost and prices 
Employment growth is forecast to ease somewhat 
while remaining solid in 2007, at 3.4%, and to 
moderate further in 2008, to around 2%. Labour force 
growth, still fuelled by increased participation and 
inward migration, is not expected to be matched fully 

by employment growth in either 2007 or 2008, 
resulting in a slight rise in the unemployment rate, to 
4.6% in 2008. Taking account of the pay element of 

the new social partnership agreement negotiated in

 2006, "Towards 2016", annual growth in per capita 
compensation is estimated to stabilise at around 4½% 
over the forecast period.  
The annual inflation rate is expected to stabilise in 
2007, despite a projected pick-up in private 
consumption, and to fall again into 2008, also 
reflecting the expected deceleration in unit labour 

costs. CPI inflation is set to remain above that of the 
HICP over the forecast period; the gap between these 
mainly reflects the expect
ed increase in average 
mortgage repayments. 
Public finances 
In 2006, the general government surplus registered 
2.9% of GDP, a significantly better outcome 
compared to the initial official target of a 0.6% deficit 

and to the expected surplus of 2.3% in the update of 
Ireland's Stability Programme
 presented in December 
2006. This rather positive outcome reflects, in 

particular, an increase in ca
pital tax receipts by the 
housing property market and,
 to a much lesser extent, 
lower-than-budgeted expenditure. Over the forecast 
period, the government surplus is projected to shrink, 

while remaining positive, at 1.5% of GDP in 2007 and 
0.9% in 2008. Besides the expansionary impact of the 
2007 budget, the reduction of the surplus is 

anticipated to be driven by slowing tax revenues as a 
result of the easing in the property market and the 
anticipated deceleration in economic activity, 

particularly in 2008. Compar
ed with these projections, 
the macroeconomic risks, if realised, have the 
potential to worsen the general government balance 

significantly.  
Government debt is projected to fall from 24.9% of 
GDP in 2006 to below 22% of GDP in 2008.

Activity in 2006
i  Economic activity accelerated
 to 4¼% in 2006, from 
3¾% in 2005. Private consumption remained robust, 
while investment bounced sharply up in 2006 and was 

largely responsible for the buoyancy of domestic 
demand. On the other hand, the contribution of public 
consumption to GDP growth was marginal, reflecting 

fiscal consolidation effo
rts. The extraordinary 
investment growth of around 12½% was driven by 
investment in housing, and, to a lesser extent, in other 

construction and equipment. The reforms in real estate 
taxation launched in 2005 and continued in 2006, 
sustained credit expansion and still very low real 

interest rates induced the st
rong acceleration recorded 
by residential investment. Public investment also 
recovered, while the impr
oving business climate and 
corporations' healthy financial position benefited 
corporate investment. Overall, domestic demand 
contributed by almost 6 percentage points to growth. 

The sustained performance of exports of goods, as 
well as the rebound that to
ok place in the tourism and 
transportation sectors, were more than outweighed by 
the strong import increase,
 after the contraction 
recorded last year. Thus, the external sector 

contributed negatively to growth. 
 Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Economic growth is project
ed to decelerate over the 
forecast horizon, with r
eal GDP growing at around 
3¾% in both 2007 and 2008. Changes in the growth 

composition compared with the 2006 outcome are 
expected to be marginal, 
except investment growth, 
which is foreseen to trend down, returning smoothly 
to historical levels. Economic activity is likely to 
remain almost exclusively domestic-demand-driven. 

Rising interest rate expectations and more moderate 
wage growth are expected to outweigh positive 
developments in employment and direct income tax 

cuts, thus inducing a marginal slowdown in private 
consumption growth, which will remain at around 
3½% per year until 2008. Government consumption 

growth is expected to move closer to GDP growth. 
Corporate investment woul
d accelerate, while growth 
in residential investments should slow down. Overall, 

domestic demand is forecast to contribute about 4% 
per year to GDP growth. 
On the external front, 
imports are projected to keep pace with domestic 

demand, while the differential with Greece™s main 
trade partners in terms of unit labour costs is expected 
to further worsen competitiveness and, consequently, 

slow down exports of goods. On the other hand, 
exports of services are expected to retain strong 
growth rates, on the back of a dynamic performance 
by tourism and shipping services in 2007. As a result, 
the contribution of the extern
al sector to GDP growth 
is projected to become 
less negative in 2007 and 
2008. Consistent with the developments in the 
external sector, the curre
nt external balance is 
projected to reach 10½% of
 GDP in 2008, compared 
with 11½% this year. 
 Labour market, costs and prices 
In line with economic activity, employment grew by 
1½% in 2006. At 6%, nominal wage growth was well 

above HICP inflation (3¼%), which, along with 
productivity growth at 2¾%, kept on pushing unit 
labour cost growth above that of the euro area. Until 

2008, employment is projected to grow at above 1¼% 
per year, while unemployment would decrease to 
below 9%. HICP inflation is
 expected to decelerate 
further, in line with more limited oil price hikes and 
wage growth moderation. Albeit still growing above 
productivity, wages would decel
erate. As a result, the 
country™s competitive position would further 
deteriorate, although the di
fferential with the euro 
area in terms of unit labour costs growth would be 
lower.

Public finances 
The general government deficit outcome for 2006 was 
2.6% of GDP, including one-off revenues of 0.6 
percentage point of GDP. The latter is related to 

payments and deferred payments by banks in 
exchange of the assumption 
by social security of 
pension commitments. For 2007, the deficit should 

decline by ¼ percentage point of GDP to 2.4% of 
GDP
ii, including one-off revenues of ½ percentage 
point of GDP. The adjustment in 2007 is mainly 

expenditure-driven. Total expenditures are projected 
to decrease by around ½ percentage points of GDP, 
mainly driven by lower interest expenditure, public 

consumption and investment. The structural balance 
(i.e. the cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-offs) 
would improve by ¼% of GDP. Under the customary 

assumption of unchanged policies, the 2008 deficit 
would be about 2¾% of GDP. After reaching 104½% 
of GDP in 2006, the general government debt ratio is 
projected to decrease to be
low 100% of GDP by 2008. 
                                                          
 i This forecast is based on the old GDP series and not on the 
"revised" GDP data reported by 
the Greek authorities in the EDP 
notification tables in April 2007. Us
ing the latter would lead to an 
upward revision of nominal GDP by around 26% per year. Given 

the magnitude and complexity of
 the revision, is still undergoing 
complete examination by Eurostat. 
ii Should the Eurostat examination confirm in full the 26% upward 
revision of nominal GDP figures, th
e denominator effect of a higher 
GDP would reduce the deficit just below 2%. However, the 
concomitant revision of the gross national income (GNI) would 
lead to a permanent increase of Greece's contribution to the EU 

budget, as well as a one-off payment of arrears on such contribution 
that would accrue to the 2007 bala
nce. According to preliminary 
estimates, this would result in a deficit close to, but below, 3% of 

GDP. 9. Spain Strong growth, high fiscal surpluses and rising external deficits - 63 -

% of GDP% of GDP
Activity in 2006 
From 3½% in 2005, economic activity accelerated in 
2006 to just below 4%. Growth was underpinned by 
dynamic domestic demand, while net exports 

continued to contribute negatively to growth, albeit by 
less than in the previous 
year. Private consumption 
remained robust, supported by strong job creation and 

by significant wealth effe
cts. It grew above real 
disposable income, thus further lowering the 
households™ saving rate to around 10% in 2006, from 

10½% in 2005. Gross fixed capital formation 
remained strong. Investment in construction grew at a 
similar rate as in 2005, and investment in equipment 

kept expanding at close to the two-digit mark. 
Domestic demand contributed around 4¾ percentage 
points to GDP growth in 2006. 
Exports recorded a strong rebound during 2006, 
largely led by the recovery of activity in the euro area 
and grew by around 6%. Imports remained very 
dynamic but they did not accelerate substantially 

compared with 2005 and increased by 8½%. As a 
result, the negative contribution of net exports to 
growth declined from 1¾ percentage points recorded 
in 2005 to around 1 percentage point. The trade deficit 
widened to 8% of GDP by the end of the year from 

7½% one year earlier. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
In 2007, GDP growth is projected to slightly fall to 
3¾%. Economic activity should still be based on 
buoyant domestic demand. Higher real interest rates 

should put some dampening impact on consumer 
demand and, therefore, private consumption would 
continue to moderate in line with GDP growth. Less 
dynamic private consumption would imply a slight 
increase of the households' saving ratio to 10¼% of 

gross disposable income.  Investment growth is 
projected to remain robust at around 6%. Residential 
construction growth is expected to slowdown and, as 

a result, households' debt increase should also 
decelerate, attaining 130% of annual gross disposable 
income. Overall, domestic demand is projected to 

contribute with 4¾ percentage points to GDP growth 
in 2007, marginally below the previous year.  
Export growth might remain at around 6%, on the 
back of good prospects 
for the euro area economic 
activity. Import growth, although projected to 
slowdown in line with private consumption, should 
still increase well above GDP on the back of strong 

investment in equipment. Overall, the moderation of 
both imports and exports should broadly cancel out 
and, as a result, the negative contribution from net 

exports to GDP growth is projected to remain broadly 
unchanged at 1 percentage point, while the trade 
deficit should continue widening to 8½% of GDP. 
GDP growth is projected to further slowdown in 2008 
to just below 3½%. The increase of real interest rates 
between 2004 and 2006 should still weigh on private 

consumption and investment in dwellings. Thus, gross 
fixed capital formation growth is projected to 
decelerate due to a moderation of construction 

activity. Overall, domestic demand would still 
contribute to GDP growth by around 4½ percentage 
points. 
The expected deceleration of domestic demand should 
Economic forecast, spring 2007 Spain 
- 64 - 
continue moderating import growth to 7%. The slight 
slowdown of economic growth projected for the 
Spanish main trading partners in the euro area would 

affect exports, the growth 
of which might decline to 
5½%, insufficient to compen
sate rising imports and, 
as a result, the trade deficit might pick up to nearly 

9% of GDP. All in all, the negative contribution to 
GDP growth from the external
 sector should stabilize 
at around one percentage point. 
Therefore, external imbala
nces should worsen over 
the forecasting horizon. On
 top of the expected 
widening of the trade defic
it, the surplus recorded by 
services is expected to
 decline marginally. The 
projected rising deficit of
 the balance of primary 
incomes mainly reflects payments on cumulated 
Spanish external debt vis-à-vis its foreign lenders. The 

deficit in the balance of current transfers should 
increase on the back of larg
er remittances abroad by 
migrants. As the surplus of services would not offset 

anymore the aggregate defic
its in the primary incomes 
and current transfers' accounts, the current account 
deficit is expected to be larger than the trade deficit 
and should rise to reach almost 10% of GDP in 2008. 
The net borrowing position vis-à-vis the rest of the 

world is projected slightly above 9% of GDP, on 
account of the expected reduction of EU transfers. 
Since there is no evidence 
supporting a rebound in 
foreign direct investme
nt inflows, portfolio 
investments, mainly channelled by domestic financial 
institutions, should continue to represent the main 

source of financing for the external deficit in Spain.  
There are risks to this scen
ario. Some of the current 
developments on households' indebtedness and 
external imbalances could finally put a brake to 

economic activity and, as a consequence, the 
slowdown in GDP growth might be stronger-than-
projected. Specifically, higher household indebtedness 

increases their exposure to interest rate rises and 
unemployment developments. Furthermore, persistent 
inflation differentials with the euro area, coupled with 

slow productivity growth could lead to higher market 
share losses, lower-than-exp
ected exports and higher 
external imbalances.  
Nevertheless, the most recent coincident and leading 
indicators do not give support to a strong deceleration 
of economic activity in the short term. Additionally, 

in spite of the rising borrowing position of 
households, mortgage repayment failures remain at 
the lowest historical level, underpinning the short-
term solvency of the priv
ate banking system. Finally, 
while the external deficit is
 not projected to recede, 
the stock of debt of the country could approach 150% 
of GDP in 2008.  
Labour market, costs and prices  
Job creation is projected to remain healthy over the 
forecast period. In 2006, 
employment growth was 
robust above 3% (full time equivalent). Construction 
and services were again the main job sources, whereas 
in the manufacturing sector, employment broadly 

stagnant. As labour intensive sectors, such as housing, 
are expected to contribute 
to a lesser extent to an 
expansion of activity, lower employment dynamism is 

projected in 2007 and 2008, when jobs would be 
created at rates of about 
2¾% and 2½% respectively. 
The unemployment rate should continue to fall over 

the forecast period, to arou
nd 7¾% of the labour force 
by 2008. 
In 2006, inflation attained an annual average rate of 
3½%, ¼ pp higher than in 2005. However, price 
pressures eased substantially in the second half of the 
year driven by lower oil prices. As a result, price 

increase bottomed out at 
2¾% in December. The 
inflation differential with the euro area picked up to 
1½pp for the year as a whol
e, although, following the 
inflation decline of the second half of the year, it 
narrowed to  ¾% at the end of the year. 
On an annual basis, HICP inflation is expected to ease 
to 2.4% in 2007, but to increase to 2.6% in 2008. The 

inflation differential with the euro area should remain 
stable at around ¾ of on
e percentage point over the 
forecasting horizon, mainly due
 to structural factors 
related to insufficient competition in certain sectors, 
such as utilities and services, coupled with indexation 
clauses and a bargaining syst
em that does not take full 
account of productivity differe
ntials across sectors.  
Compensation of employees' growth is projected to 
moderate in 2007 and 2008, reflecting lower 
dynamism in employment creation. However, in 2007 

real disposable income would increase slightly, from 
3¼% in 2006 to 3¾% in 2007, due to both lower 
inflationary pressures and the reduction of the 

personal income tax. In 20
08, real disposable income 
growth is projected to decline to 3%. Productivity 

growth for the economy as 
a whole should increase to 
around 1% per year, driven
 by an acceleration of

 productivity in the manufacturing sector over the 
forecast horizon. However,
 unit labour costs would 
still grow above those of the euro area.  
Public finances 
In 2006, the general gove
rnment surplus reached 
1¾% of GDP. This is well above the target in the 
2006 Budget Law (0.2% of GDP). Higher-than-
expected revenues are behind the better result. In 

2007, the Budget Law targets a surplus of ¾% of 
GDP compared to 1% of GDP assumed in the updated 
2006 Stability Programme. However, due to 

somewhat conservative reve
nue projections, the final 
outcome could be close to 1½% of GDP. Specifically, 
revenues in 2007 would grow at around 7%, matching 

nominal GDP growth in spite of a reform of personal 
and corporate income taxes aiming at reducing tax 
rates. Regarding central government expenditure, the 

2007 Budget Law gives priority to R&D, which is 
projected to grow in nominal terms by around 25% 
(0.6% of GDP). Overall, total expenditures are 
projected to increase by around 7½%, thus above 
nominal GDP.  
In 2008, based on the customary no-policy-change 
scenario, the general government surplus could 
narrow to just below 1¼% of GDP. Revenues are 
projected to grow at around 6½%, slightly below 

nominal GDP, reflecting fewer indirect taxes 
associated with lower dynamism of both private 
consumption and investment in dwellings. Total 

expenditures are assumed to follow previous trends 
and increase by around 7%.  
Although primary surpluses should decline from 3¼% 
in 2006 to 2¾% in 2008, the debt-to-GDP ratio is 

projected to continue on a decreasing path, from 40% 
of GDP in 2006 to around 35% in 2008.

Activity in 2006  
In 2006, economic growth gained momentum and real 
GDP grew by 2.0% in real
 terms, compared with 
1.2% in 2005. This improvement largely stems from 

an expansion of domestic demand, while net exports 
contributed negatively to GDP growth by about 0.8 
percentage points.  
GDP growth was therefore still driven exclusively by 
domestic demand and especially by private 
consumption, which both rose by 2.6%. Private 
consumption continued to be driven by buoyant wage 

increases and favourable monetary and financial 
conditions. The past increase in minimum wages still 
supported wages in 2006, but this process is now 

completed. The recovery of employment also 
sustained households™ disposable income. Inflation 
was fairly moderate despite the surge in oil prices and 

also helped strengthen households' purchasing power. 
In a macroeconomic context still characterised by 
uncertainties, firms remained cautious with respect to 

their investment plans. Nevertheless, boosted by 
favourable financial conditions, construction 
accelerated in 2006. Exports 
were also on an upward 
trend as a result of the economic recovery in Europe. 
Nevertheless, in response to the robustness of final 

demand, net trade once again made a negative 
contribution to GDP growth, albeit by much less 
(-0.3%) than over the two previous years. 
 
 Prospects for 2007 and 2008  
Real GDP growth is for
ecast to accelerate somewhat 
in 2007 and to reach its po
tential in 2008. Economic 
activity is expected to be largely driven by domestic 

demand, while the contribution of net exports to GDP 
growth will remain slightly negative. 
Private consumption is forecast to be the main driving 
force of economic growth. Consumption will increase 

in line with households' disposable income, reflecting 
the expected rise in the demand for labour and cuts in 
personal income tax planned in 2007. The projected 

benign inflation outlook should also support 
households™ purchasing power.  
Companies are likely to focu
s their efforts on cutting 
costs due to the strong past
 increase in input prices. 
But considering the fact that the capacity utilisation 
rate is now slightly above its long-term average and 
the need for some firms to upgrade and replace their 

capacity of production, investment in equipment is 
expected to accelerate from 3.
5% in 2006 to around 
5% in 2008. In addition, continuing supportive 
financial conditions and a still-robust economic 
outlook should lead firms to implement their 

investment plans. Although slightly less dynamic than 
in 2006, investment in construction is expected to 
remain robust over the forecast period. 
Export volumes are project
ed to slow down in line 
with the downturn in external demand and the 
deterioration in price competitiveness linked to the 
past appreciation of the euro. Moreover, export 

growth will still be constrained by the unfavourable 
product and geographical specialisation. In this 
Chapter 3 
Member States, France 
- 67 - 
context, and given that imports are forecast to remain 
buoyant as a result of robust final demand, the 
external sector should 
again dampen GDP growth, 
albeit by much less than in previous years.  
Labour markets, costs and prices 
Despite modest GDP growth, employment showed 
encouraging signs in 2006 (+0.8%). The recovery of 
employment has been partly supported by the gradual 

implementation of the "emergency plan" which aims 
to facilitate recruitment by small companies and 
encourage people to return to work. In 2007 and in 

2008, employment growth is set to be below 1% since 
the expected rebound of economic activity is rather 
modest and productivity growth should pick up 

modestly.  
Given the still-high unemployment rate, wage 
moderation is expected to continue over the forecast 
horizon. In addition, the moderate underlying inflation 

and the slow recovery in employment should exert a 
dampening effect on wages. As productivity growth is 
expected to slightly increas
e over the next two years, 
unit labour costs increase should slow down to 1½% 
in 2007 and 2008. With second-round effects from 

high prices of raw materials having been contained up 
to now, prices of manufactur
ed goods are expected to 
rise modestly. In view of the expected decrease in oil 

prices in the course of 2007, HICP inflation should 
drop to close to 1½% in 2007. In 2008, this tendency 
is likely to be reversed due 
to an expected increase in 
oil prices, though inflationary pressures should remain 
subdued due to the persistent negative output gap and 
HICP inflation should be slightly below 2% in 2008. 
Public finances 
Following a decline from 3.7% of GDP in 2004 to 
3.0% of GDP in 2005, the general government deficit 
was further reduced to 2.5% in 2006, thanks to one-
off revenues and higher-than-expected revenues. One-

off revenues totalled 0.3% of GDP, in connection with 
the transfer to social secu
rity of pension commitments 
vis-à-vis postal sector employees (0.1% of GDP), the 

advanced collection of social contributions on specific 
saving plans (0.1% of GDP)
 and exceptional revenues 
from the extension of the 
December 2005 change in 
the corporate tax code to more firms (0.1% of GDP). 
The budgetary outturn also benefited from higher-

than-expected revenues in
 connection with buoyant 
consumption (VAT) and higher corporate profits 
(corporate tax), which resulted in an increase in the 
tax burden to 44.4% of GDP (from 43.8% in 2005) 
despite the implementation of tax cuts (increased 

employment premium, tax exemption for new 
investment, etc). The ratio of total revenues to GDP 
increased by 0.3 percentage point to 51.0% of GDP in 

2006. On the expenditure side, the target was 
respected at the central government level but some 
slippages were recorded for health-care expenditure 

so that growth in total public expenditure overshot its 
official target, as it did also in connection with the 
continued rapid rise in local governments' 

expenditures. Still, the expenditure-to-GDP ratio 
decreased by 0.1 percentage point to 53.5% of GDP. 
The structural balance (the cyclically-adjusted-

balance net of one-offs) improved by 1 pp. 
The deficit forecast for 
2007 of 2.4% of GDP 
incorporates the measures in 
the 2007 finance law, i.e. 
the income tax reduction
i (0.2% of GDP), an increase 
in the employment premium and lower tax rates on 
new capital expenditure. Together with other small 
items, these measures will increase the deficit by 
about 0.4% of GDP. However, as revenues are 
expected to be strong Œ the tax-to-GDP elasticity will 

remain slightly above the hi
storical average of 1 Œ the 
revenue-to-GDP ratio is forecast to only decrease by 
0.2% of GDP. On the expenditure side, the 

expenditure-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to decrease by 
0.4% of GDP. This stems from opposite movements. 
It includes the implem
entation of a stricter 
expenditure ceiling for the State as contained in the 
2007 budget bill: after four years of zero growth in 
real terms, State expenditure is set to decrease by 1% 

in real terms (about -0.2% of GDP). Moreover, the 
budget bill foresees a reduction in the number of civil 
servants, which is expected to have a lasting positive 

impact on the deficit (about 0.03% of GDP) and thus 
help support the implementation of the new 
expenditure ceiling. A signif
icant decrease in social 
expenditure is also foreseen notably thanks to the 
better employment performance. In contrast, 
expenditure from local administrations, which did not 
agree on any new expenditure rule and/or ceiling, 
contrary to what was ann
ounced earlier, are expected 
to continue growing, although at a less rapid pace. 
Concerning health-care expenditure, the annual 
increase in spending is projected to be slightly higher 

than that anticipated by 
the government (3% instead 
of 2.6%) on the basis of a prudent assessment of some 
of the measures announced 
in the 2007 draft budget

the conventional assumption of unchanged policies. 
Notably, contrary to the o
fficial forecast, it does not 
include a stricter rule for 
State expenditure growth (-
1.25% in real terms) but maintains the rule applied in 
2007 (-1% in real terms). Also, it is based on no 
significant change for th
e health-care sector and 
projects a slowdown in local administration' 
investment in view of the usual slowdown in the year 
of local elections, although to a lesser extent than 

assumed by the official forecast.  
After a rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio by nearly 2 
percentage points to 66.2% of GDP in 2005, the 
government committed itself to reduce this ratio by 

2% and 1% in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Based on 
the full allocation of privatisation receipts to debt 
reduction (about 0.1% of GDP in 2006) and a better 
overall management of the debt (notably of the cash-
flow) of the different general government entities, 

debt reduction objectives were achieved in 2006 and 
are forecast to be achieve

forecast includes EUR 7.5bn

% of potential GDP
Activity in 2006  
Economic activity ended 2006 on a strong note. Real 
GDP growth accelerated to
 1.1% q-o-q in Q4-2006, 
mainly thanks to buoyant exports. The resulting 

annual growth rate for real GDP in 2006 was 1.9%, 
the highest since 2000.  Private consumption and, to a 
lesser extent, gross fixed capital formation were the 

main drivers of economic growth. Net exports also 
provided a positive contribution. By sector, the 
acceleration of GDP growth
 in 2006 reflects the 
strong recovery in manufacturing, after a long period 
of contraction: value added in this sector increased by 
more than 3½%. The robustness of this recovery 

suggests that the favourable cyclical conditions have 
acted in synergy with the unfolding of the positive 
effects of a restructuring 
process in the tradable 
sector.  Employment growth in full time equivalent terms was 
robust, at 1.6% in 2006; it was even higher when 
measured in head count te
rms by the Labour Force 
Surveys, also testifying to an increased use of part 
time contracts. The high employment content of 
growth meant that productivity stagnated in the 
economy overall, but with visible differences across 
sectors, as productivity in the manufacturing sector 

recorded a remarkable increase in conjunction with a 
relatively robust employment growth. 
HICP inflation averaged 2.2%, as in 2005, despite 
higher energy prices and a falling unemployment rate.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The acceleration in the four
th quarter of 2006 is 
having a favourable impact on real GDP growth in 
2007: the carry-over effect 
into 2007 is now at a 
comfortable +1.2%. From this good starting point, 

economic activity is expected
 to ease in 2007, on the 
back of a deceleration in industrial output, already 
visible in the first quarter 
of the year. In 2007 as a 
whole economic growth is expected to be 1.9%, 0.5 
pp. higher than in the 2006 autumn forecast. For 2008, 
a lower carry-over from 2007 and a still dynamic 

economic activity mean that 
real GDP should grow by 
1.7%, converging towards potential.  
Thanks to the expected increase in real disposable 
income, private consumption will continue to be the 

main contributor to GDP growth in both years. Some 
tax incentives on purchases of new cars and white 
goods will also contribute 
to a marginal acceleration 
in private consumption in 2007.  Investment 
expenditure will accelerate on the back of high 
capacity utilisation and an expected recovery in public 
investment; only the housing component is expected 
to slow down, partly because of higher interest rates. 
 Given less favourable external demand, exports are 
expected to slightly decel
erate in both 2007 and 2008. 
On the other hand, the stronger domestic demand is 

anticipated to lead to higher import growth. The result 
is a virtually neutral contribution to economic growth 
by net exports in 2007 and 2008. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The projected dynamic econom
ic growth in 2007 and 
2008 should still have a favourable impact on 
employment growth. Nevertheless, the labour content 
Economic forecast, spring 2007 Italy 
- 70 - 
of economic growth is expect
ed to normalise at lower 
levels than in 2006. The unemployment rate is 
projected to continue decreasing to 6.6% in 2007 and 

6.4% in 2008.  
Labour productivity is forecast to increase by 1.0% in 
2007 and 0.9% in 2008, values which, although not 
outstanding, represent a clear break compared to the 

stagnation recorded in the five-year period since 2000. 
Growth in compensation per employee in full time 
equivalent terms is expected to remain stable in 2007, 

in spite of higher social contribution rates for some 
categories of workers an
d the regularisation of 
undeclared work foreseen in the 2007 budget law, and 

to accelerate in 2008 due 
to scheduled contract 
renewals. However, higher labour productivity growth 
will result in a slowdown in the growth of unit labour 

costs, in particular in 2007. Firms will also benefit 
from the cut in the labour tax wedge through a 
reduction of the labour base of the regional tax on 

productive activity (IRAP) envisaged in the 2007 
budget law. This will have a positive impact on the 
competitive position of the Italian economy and 
mitigate somewhat the pace of market share losses. 
Moderate labour cost growth, together with 
decelerating import prices and the effects of the 

adopted liberalisation measures will help reduce HICP 
inflation to 1.9% in 2007.
 A slight acceleration of 
inflation, to 2%, is expected for 2008 on the back of 

higher production and energy costs.  
Public finances 
The deficit increased to 4.4% of GDP in 2006, up 
from 4.2% of GDP in 2005. However, this is a clearly 
better outturn than the 5.7% 
deficit that was projected 
in the stability programme 2006 update. The primary 
surplus decreased to 0.1% of GDP. Buoyant revenue 
partly offset the significant deficit-increasing impact 

of the ruling issued in September 2006 by the 
European Court of Justice (ECJ) against Italy's VAT 
regime for company cars. The latter implied 

additional expenditure officially estimated at 1.1% of 
GDP, due to the refunding of unduly paid VAT over 
the 2003 September 2006 period (of which ¾% of 
GDP relating to the years 2003 to 2005 is considered 
to be one off), as well as 
a future permanent reduction 
in VAT revenue. The cancellation of the railway 
company's debt related to the high speed project 
(Ferrovie dello Stato Œ RFI/TAV) added another 0.9% 

of GDP of one-off capital expenditure.  
Overall, the net budgetar
y impact of one-off and 
temporary measures in 2006 increased the deficit by 
1¼% of GDP, as temporary revenues from taxes on 

the revaluation of companies' assets and proceeds 
from the sale of real estate partly offset the above 
mentioned deficit-incr
easing one off capital 
expenditure. The structural deficit (defined as the 
cyclically-adjusted deficit net of one off and 
temporary measures) improved by 1¼% of GDP 

relative to 2005.  
The December 2006 update of Italy's stability 
programme projected a reduction in the deficit to 
2.8% of GDP in 2007. In the light of the positive 

economic and budgetary developments, a new report 
published on 16 March 2007 revised the official 
forecast for the 2007 defici
t downwards to 2.3% of 
GDP. This result would be achieved also thanks to (i) 
around ½% of GDP deficit-reducing measures 
adopted at the end of June 2006; (ii) about ¼% of 

GDP in additional direct taxes compensating for the 
permanent loss in VAT revenues linked to the ECJ 
ruling; and (iii) the measures adopted with the 2007 
budget law, approved by 
Parliament on 27 December 
2006, and its accompanying 
legislation, whose net 
impact is officially estimated
 at around 1% of GDP.  
The budgetary correction is essentially revenue based.  
The 2007 deficit is forecast 
at 2.1% of GDP, with a 
primary surplus at 2.7% of GDP. Higher interest rates 

imply a rise in the interest expenditure share by more 
than 0.1 pp. of GDP. The st
ructural budget balance is 
forecast to improve by about
 1% of GDP in 2007, of 
which one third is expected 
to result from the transfer 
of the severance pay scheme (TFR) flows to the social 
security institution (INPS), a measure that does not 

improve public finance sustainability. Over 2006- 
2007, the overall structural 
adjustment will exceed 2% 
of GDP, above the 1.6% required in the Council's 

Article 104(7) recommendation of July 2005. 
Starting from the better-than-expected base following 
the 2006 budgetar
y outturn, this forecast does not 
incorporate the full and effective implementation of 
some measures in the 2007
 budget. On the revenue 
side, this is notably the case for the measures aimed at 

fighting tax evasion/elusion. Moreover, the planned 
harmonisation of taxation of financial assets has been 
postponed. On the expenditure side, the planned cuts 

do not seem entirely achievabl
e. In particular, savings 
in health care expenditure are not fully taken into

 account in the forecast, also
 due to the relaxation of 
some relevant budgetary provisions. 
Risks are on both sides. On the one hand, the 
mechanisms to curb expe
nditure foreseen in the 
present and previous budgets and the measures to 
fight tax evasion/elusion could prove more effective 
than assumed. On the other hand, the current financial 

needs of the publicly-owned
 companies might call for 
additional transfers from the government. In addition, 
there are strong pressures to redistribute already in 

2007 part of the tax windfalls recorded in 2006, even 
though Italy is still a long way away from the 
medium-term objective of a balanced budget that is 

needed to reduce the very high debt ratio at a fast pace 
before the budgetary impact of ageing. Finally, the 
size of additional revenues stemming from the above 

mentioned TFR diversion to INPS is subject to 
considerable uncertainty in both directions. 
The 2008 deficit forecast at 2.2% of GDP is based on 
the customary no-policy-
change assumption. It 
includes the effects of the 
agreement recently reached 
with the unions on public sector wages. 
The government debt increased to 106.8% of GDP in 
2006, from 106.2% in 2005, due, inter alia, to the 
accumulation of deposits to finance the future cash 
disbursements related to the ECJ ruling on VAT. The 

debt ratio is expected to decline to 105% in 2007 and, 
assuming unchanged policy, to continue diminishing 
in 2008.

Activity in 2006 
Economic activity remained strong in 2006, posting a 
real GDP growth rate of 3.8%, unchanged with 
respect to 2005, and mainly driven by strong domestic 

demand. Although slightly
 decelerating compared 
with last year, private consumption remained strong 
supported by historically low interest rates and 

sustained credit expansion, as well as by continued 
employment and wage growth. In parallel, buoyant 
private investment in construction, and a rebound in 

equipment accelerated growth 
in investment to 5¼%. 
Overall, domestic demand is estimated to have 
contributed just above 4 percentage points to GDP 

growth, which was only marginally offset by a 
negative contribution of net exports. Reflecting weak 
re-export activity, exports of goods fell substantially 

in comparison with the past two years. Concurrently, 
export-oriented services have benefited from the 
positive outlook in the main export markets, while 

revenue growth from to
urism decelerated. Total 
exports are now estimated to have grown by just 
above 2% in real terms, at the same rate estimated for 
total imports, with the latter being dragged by the 
poor re-export performance. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
GDP is projected to continue growing solidly at 3.8% 
in 2007 and 3.9% in 2008, still driven by domestic 
demand, which would contribute around 4 percentage 
points to GDP growth. Increasing disposable income, 

supported by sustained wage and employment growth, 
will keep private consumption growing at still high 
rates, albeit lower than this year on account of rising 
interest rate expectations. Investment should remain 
robust and continue growing just below 5% per year 
until 2008. This expansion of investment will be 

mainly driven by construction, underpinned by a 
strong demand for dwellings by non-residents and by 
other large infrastructure projects. Furthermore, 

confidence effects linked to the prospects of joining 
the euro area should also sustain total investment 
through higher investment in machinery and 

equipment. Although the 
projected deceleration in 
private consumption should have a moderating impact 
on imports, higher investment in equipment should 

keep imports growing at high rates until 2008. 
Nonetheless, based on a stronger growth outlook for 
the EU and Cyprus™ other main trading partners, 

exports should accelerate; 
especially exports of 
business and financial services, tourism, and re-
exports of goods. As a result, the net borrowing vis-à-

vis the rest of the world is projected to inch down to 
5¼% of GDP by 2008.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Labour market conditions remained tight, at nearly 
full employment, with unemployment at around 4¾%. 
In line with buoyant economic activity, employment 
will continue growing at around 1½% per year until 

2008. However, higher participation would keep the 
unemployment rate around its current level. Higher 
participation by foreign workers, combined with 

moderate wage growth in the public sector, should 
also keep wage pressures relatively contained, in spite 
of tight labour market conditions. Since productivity 

growth is expected to rise by just above 2½% by 
2008, unit labour costs will rise, but at lower rates 
than in the recent past. 
Following closely the developments in the oil 
markets, i.e. the price hike 
at the beginning of the year 
and the lower oil prices in the second half, average 
HICP inflation in 2006 was 2.2%. Due to oil price 

base effects and the reduc
tion in car excises enacted 
in October 2006, overall HICP inflation is expected to 
moderate to 1.3% in 2007 before picking up to 2% in 
2008 against the background of buoyant domestic 
demand. This projection does not take account of the 

impact on the inflation and the budget of VAT 
increases in foodstuff, pharmaceuticals and 
restaurants required to comply with the Community 

acquis, since their precise timing and implementation 
modalities are not yet known. The resulting total

 cumulated increase in HICP inflation is estimated at 
around one percentage point.  
Public finances 
The general government deficit for 2006 is estimated 
at 1½% of GDP, about ½ percentage point of GDP 

lower than the target in the Budget Law. The initially 
budgeted ¼% of GDP from temporary revenues from 
building permits has not materialised, but this was 

more than compensated by 
higher-than-expected tax 
revenues associated with 
the buoyant performance of 
the real estate sector as well as improved tax 

administration and collection. The structural balance 
(the cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-offs) 
improved by around 1¾% of GDP in 2006. The 2007 

Budget Law targets a defici
t of just above 1½% of 
GDP. No one-off measures are planned. The fiscal 
adjustment is still mainly driven by tax revenues, 

partially offset by the reduction of EU funds. Total 
revenues are projected to ri
se by almost ¼% of GDP. 
However, expenditures will remain unchanged in 
terms of GDP, as the reduction in the interest 
payments is offset by higher social transfers. The 

Commission services projec
t an almost unchanged 
deficit (1½% of GDP), despite the better-than-
anticipated outturn for 2006, to account for the 

announced package of social
 transfers amounting to 
about ¼% of GDP. In struct
ural terms, the fiscal 
adjustment in 2007 is expected to be marginal, which 

would correspond to a broadly neutral fiscal stance. 
This also reflects the deterioration of Cyprus™ net 
position vis-à-vis the EU budget as temporary 

compensating grants associ
ated with EU accession 
came to an end in 2006, and are only partially 
compensated in the 2007 budget. In 2008, on a no-

policy-change basis, the deficit is projected to inch 
down to slightly below 1½% of GDP. The debt-to-
GDP ratio is projected to keep on a decreasing path, 

attaining about 55% by 2008, driven by the planned 
reduction of deposits with the central bank.

%  of potential GDP
Activity in 2006  
In 2006, real GDP growth reached 11.9%, which is by 
far the fastest growth since Latvia regained 
independence and is also the highest GDP growth in 

the EU. Growth was driven
 by private consumption 
and investment and the economy showed clear signs 
of overheating. The supply side struggled to keep up 

with the extraordinary incr
ease in demand stemming 
from high growth in private lending, rapid wage 
development and strong 
consumer confidence. 
Accordingly, net exports abso
rbed a large share of the 
increase in domestic demand. 
On the production side, GDP growth was strongest in 
sectors satisfying domestic demand. The highest 

growth rates were registered in the two largest sectors 
of real estate, renting and business activities (18%) 
and retail and wholesale (17%). Hotels and restaurants 

and construction (both 14%) also outperformed the 
average. Manufacturing output rose by 6.2%, 
unchanged from average annual
 growth in the 2003-
2005 period.  
Export growth declined in 2006, mainly due to the 
negative development in two commodity product 

groups (mineral and wood products). On the other 
hand, imports increased at an unprecedentedly fast 
pace, due to the huge increase in domestic demand. 

Nevertheless, the sharp deterioration in the current 
account deficit to more th
an 20% of GDP was caused 
not only by the worsening trade balance, but also by 

weak performance of almost
 all other current account 
items. On the positive side, net FDI inflows increased 
substantially to around 7% of GDP, though inflows 
were predominantly into financial intermediation, real 
estate, renting and business activities rather than in 
sectors which would expand
 the tradeable capacity. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Growth will remain robust in 2007 and 2008 with 
overheating remaining the greatest challenge. Final 
domestic demand led by investment is expected to 
continue to drive overall growth. Private consumption 

should grow robustly, given significant wage and 
employment growth. Investment is likely to regain its 
position as the fastest growing component, supported 

by a substantial increase in EU-funds. However, the 
economy is expected to slow
ly lose momentum as the 
growth of domestic demand moderates. The departure 

of real estate prices from levels substantiated by 
realistic long-term local income potential increases 
the risks in purchasing real estate properties and 

borrowing against their value. Similarly, private 
consumption should lose some of its steam as the debt 
level of households is approaching critical limits. 

Measures announced in March 2007 in the 
government's plan to combat inflation should 
facilitate a stabilisation. These measures should help 
to reduce price increases al
ready in the short run and 
taken together with an expected catch-up on the 

supply side should lead to a normalization of the real 
estate market. The plan is 
also likely to impact on 
consumer confidence by rais
ing awareness of the risks 
of indebtedness and moderate the fiscal impulse in 
domestic demand. 
However, the slow return to a more sustainable 
development path will not produce an immediate 

relief for the external balance. The current account 
deficit will remain extremely high in 2007-2008, with 
the deficit in the goods and services balance set to 

stay around 20% of GDP and the large external debt 
continuing to increase.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
High economic growth in 2006 was made possible by 
an unexpected 4.6% incr
ease in employment which 
was coming from a large increase in the activity rate 
and a pronounced reduction in unemployment. Trade 
and manufacturing registered the highest employment 
growth. Although employment growth is expected to 
remain significant in 2007-2008, it is constrained by 

an already high activity rate, low regional mobility

and high emigration. Unemployment is expected to 
decrease further, reaching 6% by 2008.  
Wage growth is poised to remain high throughout the 
forecast period, but is expected to moderate as the 

government plans to restrict public sector wages and 
as overheating eases in 
the economy. Nominal unit 
labour costs increased by ov
er 13% in 2006, and wage 
developments are likely to 
weaken further external 
competitiveness. 
HICP inflation has risen since October 2006 and 
reached 8.5% in March, despite a VAT reduction in 

January 2007 on some products and services. Core 
inflation has also picked up, as a possible 
consequence of overheating, quickly approaching the 

headline figure. In this situation, the planned energy 
tariff and other regulated price increases plus the 
scheduled excise tax harmonization with the EU will 

probably push the annual 
average inflation in 2007 
well above the level of the previous year. Inflation in 
2008 is likely to stay slightly above 6%, due to strong 
domestic demand, base effects from 2007 and a large 
increase in the excise duty on tobacco products.  
Public finances 
The fiscal outturn for 2006 is estimated to be a surplus 
of around ½% of GDP, better than expected due to 
higher than expected tax revenues. Budget revenues 
are set to continue to increase robustly over the 

forecast period, given the outlook for domestic 
demand. Taking account of tighter fiscal goals set in 
March, marginal surpluses 
are foreseen in 2007 and 
2008. In 2007 this outlook assumes the absence of 
spending all additional revenues in an autumn 
supplementary budget (a br
eak with recent practice). 
The foreseen lower expenditure base for 2007, 
relative to earlier expectations, should then contribute 
to a stronger 2008 outturn. Government debt is 

projected to drop well below 10% of GDP by the end 
of the forecast period.

%Activity in 2006 
In 2006, economic activity maintained its momentum 
with real GDP growth reaching 7.5%, domestic 
demand remaining the driver for growth. However, 

disruption of crude oil supply by pipeline and an 
accident in the oil-refining
 industry led to some 
deceleration in industrial ou
tput and export dynamics 
at the end of the year.  
Investment provided a further impetus to the economy 
and grew overall by just under 12%. Private 
consumption accelerated to 13½%, stimulated by an 

increase in household disposable income following 
the cut in the personal income tax rate in July 2006, 
rapid expansion of credit, extensive wage growth and 

increasing employment. Howe
ver, the fast pace of 
domestic growth contributed to the fast-growing 
external deficit. Net borrowing vis-à-vis the rest of the 

world widened to 9.5% of GDP compared to just 
under 6% in 2005, due to a higher merchandise trade 
deficit, a lower services 
surplus and a worsening of 
the income balance, while net current and capital 
transfers, mainly due to
 EU funds and workers' 
remittances, exerted a moderating influence.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Over the forecast period, the outlook for growth 
remains favourable. Real GDP growth is projected to 
slow somewhat but should still remain above 7% in 

2007 and 6% in 2008. Domestic demand should 
continue to be the growth engine while the external 
contribution stays negative. Delays in restoring oil 

refinery capacity and the continuing disruption of oil 
supply pose some downward 
risk to industrial output 
in 2007. There are also sign
s that this disruption could 
become permanent and supply not be restored.  
Investment activity is forecas
t to remain strong. Some 
moderation of credit growth could contribute to a 

cooling of the housing market, but new opportunities 
for construction should occur in infrastructure projects 
and in the non-residential sector.  
Private consumption growth is forecast to remain 
high, buoyed by high wage growth, higher amounts 
paid in March 2007 as compensation for earlier 
savings losses during the shift from the Russian 

rouble to the national currency and a further cut in 
personal income tax in January 2008.  
The outlook for exports should stay benign, reflecting 
positive prospects for Lithuania's major trading 

partners, with probably expanding opportunities in the 
eastern neighbouring countries, while import growth 
is forecast to remain robu
st on the back of strong 
domestic demand. A widening trade deficit will result 
in net borrowing vis-à-vis the rest of the world 
widening to around 11-12% of GDP. Positive effects 
should come from EU funds (depending on the 
absorption rate) and from an expected increase in 

expatriate remittances.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The labour market tightened rapidly in 2006. The 
labour force declined, partly reflecting emigration 
flows, while shortages in several sectors created 

upward pressures on labour costs. Employment 
growth picked up, while the unemployment rate 
declined markedly, to just below 6% from 8.3% in 

2005. Structural unemployment ameliorated, as long-
term unemployment nearly halved. 
Looking forward, the labour market is likely to 
tighten further and nominal wage growth is expected 

to remain high. Employment growth is expected to 
remain positive although somewhat lower than in 
2006, reflecting tightening supply conditions. 

Unemployment is expected 
to continue to decrease, 
although at a slower pace,
 and to stabilise at below 
5%. Against this backgr
ound, labour costs are 
increasing at a relatively fast rate. 
Annual average HICP inflation accelerated to 3.8% in 
2006, mostly reflecting rising prices for utilities 

(heating and energy), food
, healthcare and service 
prices. Core inflation rose. Lithuania's sole gas

supplier increased wholesale gas prices in July 2006 
and again in January 2007, resulting in price levels   
about 60% above those of 2005, and thus increasing 

the price of gas supplied to Lithuania towards the 
level of Western Europe. Regulated prices for heating 
have not yet been fully adju
sted to reflect the higher 
gas prices and thus the main impact on consumer 
prices and possible second-round effects have yet to 
be registered. Electricity pr
ices rose at the beginning 
of 2007 (by 7%). An increase of the excise duties on 
tobacco and fuel in March 2007 also add to inflation, 
while the favourable evolution of oil prices could ease 

inflationary pressure somewhat. Against this 
background, annual average inflation in 2007 is 
projected to rise to above 4½% in 2007. In 2008, 

inflation is expected to ease 
only slightly because of a 
new round of administered
 price increases, higher 
excise duties and an expected further gas price 

increase at the beginning of 2008, as well as the 
process of continued convergence to EU price levels 
and higher cost pressures, especially in the services 
sector. Core inflation is expected to continue to rise.  
Public finances 
In 2006, the general government deficit was 0.3% of 
GDP, lower than the initial government target of 
1.4%. Exceptionally good revenues, largely from 

improved revenues from tax on land and inheritance, 
but also personal and corporate income tax helped to 
reduce the deficit. The ex
pected stronger outturn 
occurred despite the supplementary budget adopted in 
July 2006 which increased government expenditure 
by around ½% of GDP. Th
e deficit is forecast to 
remain similar in 2007 and then to widen in 2008, 
mainly due to tax and pension reforms (including the 
cut in personal income tax from 2008 noted above) 

and higher primary spending, partly offset by 
improved tax collection, particularly of VAT and 
property taxes, and higher excise taxes. The general 

government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain 
broadly stable at slightly below 20% of GDP.

Graph 3.19: 
Luxembourg - Employment and GDP 
                    growth
Activity in 2006  
GDP growth accelerated in 
the course of 2006 and 
reached 6.2% over the year
, up from 4% in 2005. 
Final domestic demand remained rather dynamic: 

private consumption grew at about 4%, boosted by 
strong employment growth and, linked to it, the 
considerable rise in the total wage bill (more than 

6½% in 2006). On the other hand, investment 
remained rather subdued and government 
consumption, which had been rather dynamic in 2005, 

decelerated as a result of 
the budgetary adjustment 
measures decided by the 
government in April-May. 
The main source of the strong GDP growth was an 

exceptionally buoyant foreign trade performance: 
total exports grew by about
 15% in real terms and 
imports by about 12½%, with exports and imports of 

services growing even faster. The contribution of net 
exports to GDP growth, which was slightly negative 
in 2005, was very strongly positive in 2006 (about 

6%). 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Real GDP growth is forecast to
 remain fairly strong in 
the coming years though some
what less than in 2006. 
Domestic demand is likely to remain buoyant: 
investment is expected to
 accelerate in 2007 and to 
slow down only marginally in 2008. Private 

consumption is forecast to
 decelerate slightly and 
government consumption should continue to grow 
more slowly as a result 
of the recent adjustment 
measures. However, the main reason for the slight 
slowdown in GDP growth is foreign trade, which is 
not expected to remain as buoyant as in 2006, because 
of decelerating demand from the country's main 
trading partners. Overall, GDP growth could reach 
between 4½% and 5% in both 2007 and 2008. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
After rising by slightly less than 3% in 2005, 
employment growth accelerated
 in the course of 2006 
to about 4% year-on-year in the last months. In the 
year as a whole, it expanded by about 3¾%. In 2007 

and 2008, employment growth is expected to slow 
down slightly, thus only partially reflecting the 
(limited) deceleration in output, following a pattern 

already observed in 2001-2003.  
Employment growth since the beginning of the 
decade had mostly benefite
d non-residents, who now 
exceed one third of the total labour force in 

Luxembourg and have represented about two thirds of 
its increase in recent years. As a result, residents' 
unemployment has been rising since mid-2002. 

However, with the accelera
tion in job creation, the 
rise in unemployment significantly slowed down in 
the course of 2006. With employment growth 
projected to remain st
rong over the period, 
unemployment should stabilise, probably already in 

the course of 2007 and then begin declining in 2008.  
Due mostly to the large in
crease in oil prices that 
occurred in the first half of
 2006, inflation accelerated 
in the course of the year, with the national CPI rising 

by 2.7% compared to 2.5% in 2005. However, the 
subsequent decline in oil prices led to a strong 
deceleration in inflation in th
e second half of the year. 
This deceleration was more
 pronounced for the HICP 
than for the national CPI, which excludes 
consumption by non-residents and especially their 

large purchases of car fuel, alcohol and tobacco 
products. As a result, the HICP slowed down on a 
yearly average in 2006, risi
ng by 3.0% compared to 
3.8% in 2005.  Under the assumption of a more 
limited increase in oil prices in 2007 and 2008 than in 
2005-2006, inflation is projected to slightly decrease 

in 2007, before reaccelera
ting somewhat in 2008. 
Public finances  
After reaching 1.2% of GDP in 2004, the deficit 
decreased to 0.3% in 2005 
and then turned into a 
slight surplus (0.1% of GDP) in 2006.  This 
improvement was essentially due to higher-than-
expected revenues, especi
ally from direct taxes,

generated by strong output and employment growth, 
but also to adjustment measures decided in April 2006 
by the government and the business and labour 

organisations in order to cope with the deterioration in 
public finances and to reinforce the competitiveness 
of the economy. These meas
ures mainly consist of 
increases in several contributions and taxes and a 
temporary (up to 2009) suspension of the normal 
indexation of wages and social benefits on consumer 

prices, which will be replaced by an indexation at 
predetermined dates. Moreover, government 
investment, which had been rising very fast in 2005, 

decreased by 2.3% in 2006. In 2007, the surplus is 
projected to increase thanks to still robust output and 
employment growth and to the lasting effects of the 

adjustment measures decided in 2006, which should 
result in some slowdown in expenditure growth. 
Under an unchanged policy assumption Œ implying in 

particular that the adjustment measures decided in 
spring 2006 will continue to be carried out as planned 
despite the better-than-expected 2006 outcome Œ the 
consolidation is forecast to
 continue in 2008. The 
government debt, though remaining very low (6.1% 
of GDP in 2005) rose by 0.7 percentage point of GDP 

in 2006 because several loans related to road and 
railway infrastructure projects were issued during the 
year for a total of about 1 percentage point of GDP.

Hungary - Contribution to GDP growth
Activity in 2006 
In 2006, GDP growth slightly decreased to 3.9% from 
4.2% in 2005. The domestic
 deceleration was mainly 
driven by a marked decline in private investment and 

in government consumption; household consumption 
also decelerated, albeit to a lesser extent. Confidence 
indicators showed a strong deterioration after the 

adoption of a fiscal consolidation package in summer 
2006. Net exports were the primary driver of GDP 
growth reflecting a spectac
ular 18% expansion of 
exports along with a smaller but still significant 
increase in imports of 12
.6%. The current account 
deficit is expected to decline to 5.9% of GDP in 2006, 

from 6.8% of GDP in 
2005 (national accounts 
definition).  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The economic slowdown is expected to continue in 
2007 when real GDP growth is forecast to fall to 2.4% 

with a large part of the budgetary consolidation 
measures entering into for
ce at the beginning of the 
year. Tax increases and cuts in price subsidies are 
likely to contribute to a decline in households' real 
disposable income, leading to a contraction of 

household consumption by 0.6%; government 
consumption should also
 continue decreasing. 
Investment is projected to pick up slightly, mainly 

driven by the strong growth in the export-oriented 
manufacturing sector; by contrast, public investment 
should drop significantly. Net exports are likely to 

continue driving GDP growth
, with exports benefiting 
from favourable external conditions while the 
deceleration of domestic demand may be expected to 
slow down the growth of imports. 
A modest recovery of domestic demand is expected 
for 2008. Consumption should start increasing slightly 
and investment may grow at around 4% in the wake 

of an increasing inflow of EU structural funds. GDP is 
projected to grow at 2.6%, mainly driven by a 
sustained strong foreign trade performance. The 

current account deficit coul
d fall to close to 2% of 
GDP by 2008. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment is projected to stagnate over the next two 
years as a result of downsizi
ng measures in the public 
sector and relatively unfavourable cyclical conditions. 
Recently adopted regulatory 
measures should support 
the increasing trend in the la
bour force. Consequently, 
the unemployment rate, which rose to 7.5% in 2006, 
is projected to continue increasing above the EU 
average in 2007. Public se
ctor wage freezes and the 
slowdown of economic 
activity are likely to 
contribute to curbing private sector wage inflation. 
The compensation of employees in the total economy 
is therefore expected to grow at rate below HICP 
inflation in 2007 and slightly above it in 2008.  
Consumer price inflation (H
ICP) rose to an annual 
average of 4% from 3.5% in 2005, mainly resulting 
from the large increase in ad
ministered prices in the 
second half of the year. Inflation is projected to peak 

above 8% in the first half
 of 2007 and to start 
decreasing thereafter. The 
expected annual average 
inflation rate is 7.5%. The disinflation in the second 

half of 2007 should result on the one hand from the 
progressive running-out of the major one-shot impact 
of fiscal measures introdu
ced in the second half of 
2006 (VAT hike, cuts of price subsidies), and on the 
other hand from the recent 
appreciation of the forint 
back to its January 2006 level. Annual inflation of 

3.9% is projected in 2008, in the light of possible 
second-round effects. 
Public finances 
The government deficit increased to 9.2% of GDP in 
2006, up from 7.8% in 2005. The fiscal deterioration 
was due to significant slippages on the expenditure 
side, which were only partly compensated by 

consolidation measures adopt
ed in the second half of 
the year by the re-elected
 Government. In 2007, the 
deficit is expected to decr
ease markedly, to 6.8% of

GDP, due to the fiscal adju
stment. Based on the usual 
no-policy-change assumptio
n, the forecast projects a 
continued improvement in 2008 to 4.9% of GDP, 

thanks to a further reduction in expenditure on social 
transfers and government consumption already 
incorporated in the 2007 bu
dget and in a series of 
reform laws and Government decisions. In structural 
terms the deficit is expected to fall from 9.4% in 2006 
to 6.1% of GDP in 2007 and to 4½% of GDP in 2008. 
The decrease in the budget deficit in 2007 is partly 
explained by increases in taxes and social 
contributions adopted by Parliament in July 2006, 
entailing an increase in the tax burden of 0.8 

percentage point in 2007 to 38.1% of GDP. On the 
expenditure side, a number of freezes in operational 
and wage expenditure as well as cuts in investment 

(totalling around 1¼% of GDP in 2007) are to be 
continued until end-2008. Moreover, initial structural 
reform measures, especially in
 the areas of health care 
and public administration, are also considered. 
However, it is assumed that not all of the planned 
savings in social transfers and government 
consumption will be achieved, since it may be 

difficult to fully enforce the envisaged cuts in 
preventive care and in public administration, 
particularly in 2008. The impact of the February 2007 

public wage agreement is only reflected in higher 
pension expenditure (through the indexation 
mechanism) in both 2007 a
nd 2008, in the absence of 
a decision on the conditional top-up payments in 
2008. The forecast does 
not include any debt 
assumption from the state-guaranteed debt (over 1% 

of GDP) of the national railway (MÁV), nor any 
additional capital injections to cover the possible 
losses of MÁV, although there is a risk that both may 

happen at some point.  
After a significant increase 
in 2006 to 66% of GDP, 
the debt ratio is projected to continue to increase 
although more moderately.

Malta - General government finances
Activity in 2006 
Following a period of w
eak economic performance, 
Malta™s GDP continued to grow at a sustained pace 
for a second consecutive year in 2006. Real GDP 

grew by 2.9%, driven by dynamic domestic demand, 
in particular private and public consumption and a 
significant contribution of th
e external sector. Private 
consumption increased by 2.6%, as the depressing 
effect of higher energy 
prices was outweighed by 
sustained employment creation and a continued 

expansion in consumer credit. Gross fixed capital 
formation contracted by 1% due to lower public 
investment, mainly reflecting constraints in the 

capacity to absorb EU fund
s. Overall, final domestic 
demand contributed around 2.4 percentage points to 
GDP growth. 
After contracting in 2005, real exports of goods and 
services grew by 1.4% in 2006 mainly on account of 
higher exports of electro
nics and pharmaceuticals. 
Imports contracted by 0.5% in 2006, pulled down by 

the fall in investment and despite strong consumption 
and a turnaround in exports, which are characterised 
by a relatively high import content. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
GDP is expected to continue to grow at a healthy pace 
of 3% in 2007 and to slow marginally to 2.8% in 
2008. Economic activity is
 forecast to be mainly 
domestically-driven in both years, although the small 
negative contribution of the external sector in 2007 is 
projected to turn positive in 2008. Private 

consumption is anticipated to grow at a slightly faster 
pace, 2.8% in 2007, on acco
unt of an improvement in 
the disposable income brought about by lower 
personal income taxes, a continuation of high 
employment and lower energy prices. The dissipation 

of the effect of the tax cu
t, as well as the assumed 
higher oil prices for 2008 
are expected to lead to a 
small deceleration in the rate of increase of private 

consumption in 2008. Public consumption is projected 
to increase at low rates in 2007 and 2008 reflecting 
the continuation of fiscal consolidation. Gross fixed 

capital formation is foreseen to expand significantly 
in 2007, by around 6%, reflecting higher capital 
spending linked to the completion of the Mater Dei 

hospital, whereas in 2008, investment is anticipated to 
decelerate to 0.3% due to a fall in public investment. 
Overall, final domestic demand is expected to 

contribute by slightly more than 3 percentage points 
to GDP growth in 2007 and 2 percentage points in 
2008.  
The recovery of exports of goods and services is 
anticipated to accelerate in
 2007 on account of an 
expected improved performance of services, 
specifically in the remote gaming sector and tourism. 
For 2008, the growth in exports is expected to remain 
practically unchanged. Imports are foreseen to 

increase by 2.7% in 2007, reflecting the relatively 
high increase in private consumption, buoyant 
investment and a higher expansion of exports. In 

2008, import growth 
is forecast to d
ecelerate to 1.8% 
on account of the deceleratio
n in private consumption 
and investment activity. 
Following a decline to 6.3% of GDP in 2006, the 
current account deficit is projected to improve further 
to 5.6% of GDP in 2007 on the back of higher 
exports. For 2008, a deceler
ation of imports and a 
continued strong performance of services exports are 
forecast to lead to a furthe
r fall in the current account 
deficit to 4.4% of GDP. As a result of the 

improvement in the curren
t account, ne
t borrowing vis-à-vis the rest of the world is foreseen to decline to 
1.5% of GDP by 2008. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment growth reached 0.9% in 2006 in line 
with historical trends. 
The pace of employment 
creation is anticipated to remain unchanged in 2007 

and 2008. Over the 
forecast horizon, jobs are expected 
to be mainly generated by the services sector, in 
particular information technology, financial services 

and activities arising from the utilisation of new

 opportunities such as remote gaming and call centres. 
As a result, the unemployment rate is foreseen to 
decline to 7.3% by 2008. HICP inflation increased to 

2.6% in 2006, mainly due to higher energy prices. It is 
forecasted to slow down to
 slightly below 1.5% in 
2007, and rise marginally above 2% in 2008 on 

account of assumed energy price developments as 
well as the assumption that the exceptionally low 
underlying inflation recorded in the recent months 

will return to historical trends.  
Public finances 
The budgetary consolidation that commenced in 2004, 
continued in 2006, when the general government 
deficit fell to 2.6% of GDP as a result of lower-than-

planned capital expenditure. The structural balance 
(cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-offs) improved 
by slightly more than 1% point of GDP in 2006. 
For 2007, the deficit is projected to decline further to 
2.1% of GDP. The fall in the general government 
deficit is explained by a deceleration in current 
expenditure primarily due to a significantly slower 
rise in wages and salaries in the public sector than 

nominal GDP and reflects th
e government's drive to 
contain spending. The adjustment in 2007 is also 
projected to be facilitated by lower interest 

expenditure on account of th
e large reduction in the 
debt ratio in 2006. 
For 2008, under the no-policy-change scenario, which 
excludes one-off operations, 
the deficit is expected to 
decline further to 1.6% of GDP. The improvement in 
the fiscal stance will result mainly from lower 
government gross fixed capital formation linked with 

the completion of a large healthcare facility. 
General government debt in 2006 stood at around 
66.5% of GDP and is anticipated to decline to slightly 
below 66% of GDP in 2007. Under the no-policy-

change scenario, the debt ratio is foreseen to fall to 
64.3% of GDP in 2008.

Activity in 2006
 Economic growth was strong throughout 2006, 
posting on average 0.7% growth quarter-on-quarter. 
Annual economic growth came out well above 

potential, at 2.9%, benefiting from both resilient 
domestic demand and vigorous international trade 
developments. 
Adjusted for statistical effects related to the health-
care reformi, private consumption expenditure showed 
robust growth of around 2.4% on average in 2006, 
significantly outpacing disposable household income 

growth in the first half of the year. In the second half 
of 2006, private consumption expenditure growth 
stagnated, mainly as a result of durable goods 

consumption returning to more normal levels. Other 
factors explaining the mid-year consumption 
slowdown include lower consumption of beverages 

and tobacco and a fall in household energy 
consumption on account of high average temperatures 
in the autumn. 
Total investment was also robust in 2006, posting 
annual growth of 6.7%. Investment in equipment 
grew particularly strongly, by around 14%, but 

construction growth was also solid at 4.3%. The 
increase in investment demand predominantly 
originated in the private sector, which responded to 

high levels of capacity utilisation and good future 
demand prospects. 
Exports of goods and services increased by 7.5% in 
2006 on the back of solid international trade 

developments. The contribution from net exports was 
nonetheless small as import growth outpaced export 
growth, propelled by improving private investments 
and consumption expenditure. 
Consumer price developments remained relatively 
subdued, despite a high average contribution of 

energy to HICP of 0.7 percentage point in 2006. 
Headline HICP inflation was 1.7% and fell slightly 
within the year, mainly on account of falling oil 

prices, which reduced the contribution of energy 
components towards the end of 2006. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008
  Over the forecast horizon, GDP growth is expected to 
remain well above current estimates of potential 

growth (around 2%). GDP is projected at 2.8% in 
2007, easing only slightly to 2.6% in 2008. Domestic 
demand is likely to be the main driver of economic 

growth in both years, while the contribution from net 
exports is expected to fall. 
Although private consumption growth in 2007 will be 
affected by a relatively low carry-over from 2006 

(stemming from the stagnation in the second half of 
the year) and remain below 
2% on an annual basis, 
the underlying quarterly growth pattern is projected to 
be robust. Building on expected strong household 
disposable income developments, private 

consumption growth will somewhat strengthen from 
0.7% quarter-on-quarter in early 2007 to 0.8% 
quarter-on-quarter at the end of 2008. In 2008, annual 

private consumption growth will probably come out 
slightly below 3%. 
The household saving rate (Graph 3.22) has shown a 
steady decline over the pa
st decade, influenced 
inter 
Chapter 3 
Member States, The Netherlands

alia
 by positive wealth effects from rising house 
prices. In 2007 and 2008, th
e saving rate is expected 
to recover slightly from its all-time low of 11.3% in 

2006 and come out at around 11¾% in both years.  
As the economic cycle matures, total investment 
growth is expected to slow somewhat from the high 
growth in 2006. The prospects for investment are 

nevertheless held up by regained producer confidence, 
strong profit developments in
 recent years and slightly elevated capacity utilisation rates. 
On the external side, net trade should provide a slight 
positive contribution to growth in 2007, turning 
marginally negative in 2008. The main factors behind 
this development are the expected softening of world 

import growth over the forecast horizon, a small loss 
in international competitiveness of Dutch exports, and 
strong domestic demand factors pushing up imports of 

goods and services.  
Labour markets, costs and prices 
Despite an almost stable total population over the 
forecast horizon, labour suppl
y is expected to grow by 
around 1% per year as labour participation increases 
in line with strong economic activity. Furthermore, 
the above-potential economic growth performance is 

likely to result in continued high demand for labour 
throughout the forecast horizon. With an 
unemployment rate already starting at a low level of 

3.9% in 2006 and the number of unfilled vacancies 
nearing its all-time high towards the end of 2006 
(Graph 3.23), the labour mark
et is expected to tighten 
further in 2007 and 2008. Already in early 2007, this 
is becoming visible as several industries are now 
reporting that labour shortages are restricting an 

expansion of production. Over the course of the 
forecast horizon, the unemplo
yment rate is expected 
to fall to 2¾% of the labour force, its lowest level 

since 2001. The tensions building up in the labour market are 
expected to exert significant upward pressure on 
wages. At the start of 2007, evidence is mounting that 

contractual wages are accelerating. Compensation of 
employees per full-time equivalent is forecast to 
increase by around 3½% in 2007 and more vigorously 
by 3¾% in 2008. Towards the end of the forecast 
horizon, the rise in compensation of employees is 

expected to dampen labour demand growth. 
Employment growth in 2008 is therefore likely to 
slow to 1% in 2008, from 1¼% in 2007. 
The strong increase in the compensation of employees 
will outpace expected labou
r productivity growth, 
raising unit labour costs by around 1½% in 2007 and 
2% in 2008. Despite the increase in unit labour costs, 
consumer price inflation as measured by the HICP is 

foreseen to remain relatively benign in 2007, at 1½%, 
on account of a falling contribution from energy 
prices. In 2008, HICP infl
ation is forecast at around 
2%, reflecting a steady upward trend in underlying 
inflation which will accelerate towards the end of 
2008.  
Public finances 
The general government balance posted a surplus of 
0.6% of GDP in 2006, which is 0.9 percentage points 
better than the budgetary outturn in 2005. The main 
factors contributing to the improved outcome were 

higher tax revenues on account of the improved 
economic situation, a better outturn of the balance of 
local governments and higher gas revenues. The 2006 
outcome is more than 2 percentage points better than 
the targeted deficit of 1.5% of GDP in the stability 

programme update of December 2005. 
In 2007, the general governm
ent balance is foreseen 
to come out at a deficit of 0.7% of GDP. Factors 
contributing to the worsening of the budget balance 

are expenditure overruns in
 the execution of the 
budget of around ½% of GDP, social benefits coming 
out ¼% of GDP higher and lower mineral gas 

production related to weather conditions. 
Furthermore, the good budgetary outcome that local 
governments have attained in 2006 is not expected to 

carry over into 2007. Th
e recent agreement on the 
upcoming constitutional reform of the Dutch Antilles 
included a takeover of debt, which worsens the 

nominal government balance in 2007 by 0.1% of 
GDP. Finally, the new government increased the 
generosity of the disability scheme, leading to 

additional expenditure of around 0.1% of GDP 
annually from 2007 onwards.
 In structural terms, the 
government balance is projected to deteriorate by 
1½% of GDP, which implie
s a clearly pro-cyclical 
fiscal stance in 2007 at
 a time of strong economic 
growth.

 On a no-policy-change basis, the nominal budgetary 
balance is expected to impr
ove again in 2008 to reach 
a balanced budget. The significant improvement 

compared with 2007 is in part explained by an 
expected increase in gas receipts resulting from the 
assumed rise in oil and gas prices towards the end of 

the forecast horizon. Furthermore, the elasticity of 
social contributions to the compensation of employees 
is expected to fully return to its long-term value and 

no further debt takeovers are currently foreseen for 
2008. 
The no-policy-change assumption implies that the 
planned measures of the new government, which are 

set out in the new government's programme, are not 
taken on board in the forecast as many details of the 
planned measures are not yet available. If all the 

measures that are planned for 2008 were 
implemented, this would further improve the 
government balance by around 0.4% of GDP in 2008. 
The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall from 48.7% 
in 2006 to 47.7% in 2007 and 45.9% in 2008, mainly 
as a result of the increase in nominal GDP and the 

development of the nominal government balance, 
while stock-flow adjustment is likely to exert some 
upward influence on the government debt level in 

2007.

Graph 3.24: 
Austria - Total labour force and total 
                     employment (changes in 1000 persons)
Activity in 2006 
The Austrian economy grew 
by 3.1% in 2006 with 
quarter-on-quarter growth rates remaining high until 
the end of the year. The fo
urth quarter saw Austria's 
economy growing by 0.8% q-o-q in real terms after 
1.0% in the third quarter.  
Dynamic exports and buoyant industrial activity were 
the twin engines powering the growing investment 

dynamics. The rebound was particularly spectacular 
for equipment investment, supported by the current 
high capacity utilisation. Similarly, construction 

investment grew much more strongly than in the 
previous years. Exports, for their part, benefited from 
the recovery in Europe and notably in Germany, as 

well as from a strong competitive position. With both 
private and government consumption remaining 
subdued during the year, net exports provided the 

major contribution to GDP growth. 
Lively activity gave an impetus to the labour market, 
with total employment rising by around 1½% from 
the previous year. A substantial part of this increase 
was accounted for by part-tim
e workers. Because of a 
strong rise in labour supply (both domestic and from 

abroad), however, the corresponding fall in 
unemployment was less pronounced.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Buoyant activity is expected to continue in 2007, 
followed by a more moderate growth performance in 

2008. The output gap almost closed in 2006 and is 
expected to turn positive in 2007 and 2008. While in 
2006 net exports were the key driving force, growth 
should be more balanced over the forecast period. 
Especially in 2007, gross fixed capital formation is 
expected to speed up further, with both construction 

and equipment investment being strongly upward 
bound. In 2008, capital formation is expected to lose 
momentum.   
The favourable competitive situation, with unit labour 
cost staying in line with those of Austrian™s major 
trading partners, is supporting net exports. Exports 
will maintain their strong upward trend, thanks to the 

accelerating demand in Europe. The high import 
intensity of what is expected to be brisk investment in 
2007 will give rise to higher imports. Nevertheless, 

the current account will stay in comfortable surplus. 
Despite the lack of snow in low-lying areas, the 
winter tourism season has been promising so far, such 
that tourism services should continue to provide a 

positive contribution to economic growth. 
Having lagged behind the other demand components, 
private consumption is expected to accelerate, 
supported by rising employment. The household 
saving ratio is projected to moderate slightly in 2008. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment is expected to remain upward bound, 
with a higher number of full-time jobs likely to be 

created than during the last 
few years, as the cyclical 
upswing typically favours full-time job sectors such 
as manufacturing and construction. In full-time-

equivalents, employment is estimated to rise by 1¼% 
in 2007 . However, the ongoing increase in labour 
supply will limit the decrease in unemployment. The 

unemployment rate should abate to 4¼% by the end 
of the forecast period.  
Wage and price movements so far developed only 
moderately with a Harmonised Consumer Price Index 

(HICP) increase of 1.7%. The cyclical upturn is likely 
to be accompanied by slig
htly higher wage growth. 
Compensation of employees per head is expected to 

increase by 2½% in 2007 co
mpared with the previous 
year. Unit labour costs are rising only slowly and are 
even declining in the manufacturing industry. With 
the HICP expected to increa
se by 1¾ in both years, 
inflation will maintain
 its moderate pace.

 Public finances 
In 2006, the general government deficit, amounting to 
1.1% of GDP, turned out lower than previously 
estimated. The favourable outturn is due to higher-

than-expected receipts from 
corporate tax and indirect 
taxes. The projected favourable cyclical conditions 
are set to ensure healthy growth of revenues over the 

entire forecast period. 
The federal budget for 2007 and 2008 was presented 
by the new Government at the end of March. Indirect 
taxes on fuel are expected 
to increase in 2007, as are 
social security contributions in 2008. Regarding 
additional government spending, the new budget 
gives priority to R&D, education and social affairs. 

Additionally, expenditures on military equipment are 
likely to burden the budget. 
Both revenues and expenditure continue their 
downward trend as % of GDP. Nevertheless, despite 

buoyant growth of nominal revenues, expenditure is 
set to rise unabated, keeping the government deficit 
close to 1% of GDP, with no improvement in the 
structural budget balance. The debt ratio is expected 

to ease down further, dipping below the 60%-of-GDP 
reference value in 2008.

Activity in 2006 
At 6.1%, GDP growth in 2006 surprised positively 
compared to previous e
xpectations (5.3% in the 
Commission services' autu
mn 2006 forecast). 
Economic activity accelerated
 markedly in the final 
quarter of 2006 when economic growth reached 6.3% 
year-on-year on the back 
of a strong pick-up in 
investments. A mild winter allowed continuing 
construction activities and drove up gross fixed 
capital formation by 16.5% in 2006 as a whole. 

Domestic demand grew by a strong 6.6% in 2006, 
also thanks to strong private consumption.  
Export growth nearly doubled to 14.5% in comparison 
with 2005, and import growth surged to 15.8%, up 

from 4.7% in 2005. Overall, GDP growth in 2006 was 
supported by domestic demand. The contribution of 
net exports to GDP growth turned negative (-0.5 

percentage points), which can be explained by rising 
investment- and consumption-driven imports.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
GDP growth is likely to grow at 6.1% in 2007, 
moderating to 5.5% in 2008. Domestic demand is 
expected to be the main driving force in both years. 
Investment growth is anticipated to remain strong 

over the forecast period, contributing to rising 
potential GDP growth, while private consumption 
should remain robust. This outlook is underpinned by 

short-term indicators which point to industrial 
production, retail sales and construction activity 
reaching historically high leve
ls in the first quarter of 
2007. Companies have recorded large profits in 2006 
(the highest since 2004) which should spur investment 
as capacity utilisation is stretched. The solid financial 
position of enterprises is also reflected in improved 
profitability and liquidity ratios across all sectors and 

a lower total cost ratio. In particular, the situation is 
better among construction companies, in the services 
sector and also among ex
porters. The projected 
growth of overall investments can reach nearly 18% 
in 2007 and moderate to about 14% in 2008. It will be 
supported by increasing absorption of EU funds.  
Private consumption is likely to benefit from growing 
real wages, improving labour market conditions and 
direct payments to farmers. The planned tax wedge 
cuts and the reintroduction of the indexation of 

personal income tax brackets to inflation will also 
provide a stimulus to consumption.  
Growing imports in line with strengthening domestic 
demand are projected to lead
 to an increase in the 
trade and current account defi
cits this year and next. 
The deficit in goods trade in 2007 is expected to 
almost double to 2¾% of GDP and deepen further to 

about 4% of GDP in 2008. The surplus in services 
should stabilise at around ¾% of GDP. However, 
higher transfers from the EU will have a moderating 
impact on both the curren
t and capital accounts. After 
reaching 2.1% in 2006, the 
current account deficit is 
expected to widen to about 3% in 2007 and 4¼% in 
2008. This deficit will continue to be largely financed 
by a stable inflow of foreign direct investments which 

in 2006 amounted to about PLN 43 bn (over 4% of 
GDP).  
 Economic forecast, spring 2007 Poland 
- 90 - 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Labour market conditions improved substantially in 
2006. Employment grew by 3.4%, and is expected to 
stay on an upward trend ov
er the forecast horizon, 
though the employment rate will remain low, at 
56.5% in 2008. Projected employment growth should 
translate into a lower unemployment rate, which will 

come down in 2008 to below 10%, the lowest rate 
since the beginning of the economic transformation 
from a centrally planned to a market economy. 

However, part of the decrease in the unemployment 
rate is due to a falling participation rate associated 
with outward labour migration and early retirement. 

The planned reduction of taxes on labour should also 
have a favourable impact on employment, though its 
effect in some sectors may not be very significant 

within the forecast horizo
n due to emerging labour 
shortages.  
Unit labour costs fell by 0.7% in 2006. Despite strong 
productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, rapid 

wage growth in the non-manufacturing sector will 
increase unit labour costs 
in the whole economy by 
about 1½% in 2007 and ½% in 2008. However, real 
unit labour costs are expected
 to fall in the forecast 
period, increasing the profitability of Polish 

enterprises. An upside risk 
for the real unit labour cost 
stems from the service sector where most jobs are 
likely to be created and wher
e it is difficult to increase 
productivity.  
HICP inflation fell to 1.3% in 2006 despite relatively 
high food prices. Planne
d excise duty hikes and 
higher wage demands, fuelled partly by labour 

shortages in certain segments of the market, will put 
upward pressure on inflation in 2007 and 2008. 
However, an ample supply of labour, especially 

among the young, increased competition, falling 
prices of durable goods and lower fuel prices should 
mitigate the impact. Furthermore, the Polish Central 

Bank will keep a tight grip on monetary policy in 
order to keep the inflation rate around its medium-
term target of 2.5%. Thus, inflation is forecast to 
reach 2.0% in 2007 
and 2.5% in 2008.  
Public finances  
The prospects for public finances have improved 
since the 2006 autumn forecast as a result of much 

better than expected growth leading to higher 
revenues. Additionally, expenditure plans were not 
fully executed. At present, the 2006 general 
government deficit is estimated at 3.9% of GDP 
compared to an earlier prediction of 4.2% (pension 

reform costs included
i). In particular, the central 
government deficit was mu
ch lower than budgeted 
and revenues from social contributions were higher 

than projected. Expenditures turned out lower because 
of smaller-than-expected absorption of EU funds, 
which resulted in less investment. The lower-than-

budgeted social expenditure caused by a sharp decline 
in registered unemployment also contributed to the 
expenditure savings. 
The general government deficit is expected to reach 
3.4% of GDP in 2007, as planned in the November 
2006 convergence programme
. This reflects the better 
2006 outturn and expectations of much stronger tax-

rich GDP growth than in autumn 2006. The 
government intends to bring forward social 
contribution cuts to mid-2007. The reintroduction of 

the indexation of personal income tax brackets and 
pro-family tax relief will be the other revenue-
reducing measure. However, these tax reductions will 
be offset by still-high growth of the social 
contributions™ base thanks to fast rising wages and 

employment and smaller incentives to stay in the 
unregistered economy. Besides, as a consequence of 
social contribution cuts, there will be larger personal 

income tax revenues, thanks to higher taxable income, 
and slower increase in expenditure on gross wages in 
the public sector. Hikes of 
excise duties on fuel and 
cigarettes are the main revenue-increasing measures 
in 2007. 
In 2008, based on the customary no policy change 
assumption, the general government deficit ratio is 

expected to improve only marginally, to 3.3% of 
GDP, compared to a target
 of 3.1% of GDP in the 
November 2006 convergen
ce programme. The current 
forecast takes the announced 
cuts in contributions to 
the disability funds into consideration. They are 
estimated at about 1% of GDP and will be partly 

offset by the same mechanisms as in 2007, namely a 
wider tax base. If the reorganisation of the public 
administration starts in 2008, as intended by the 
government, the outturn may 
be better than forecast. 
On the other hand, if costly annual indexation of 

pensions and social benefits to wage growth is 
restored, the general government balance may turn out 
worse.

and is expected to increase in the following years.

Forecast
Activity in 2006 
In 2006, economic activity 
accelerated by 1.3%, after 
growing by 0.5% in 2005, with the external sector 
providing the bulk of GDP growth. Specifically, 

having gradually improved since late 2005, exports 
expanded swiftly, helped by lively world demand.  
Domestic demand added little to economic activity. 
Investment receded again, though its components 

showed divergent behaviour: the downsizing of 
construction seen since the start of the decade 
continued, whereas equipment investment growth 

entered positive territory. A marked contraction in 
public investment was key in the total investment 
outturn. Household consumption moderated compared 

with 2005 and government consumption fell slightly.  
The trade developments in 2006 allowed an 
improvement in the goods an
d services balance. Yet, 
and despite also a recovery of current transfers, a 

widening of the external borrowing was observed, 
reflecting a sharp deterioration in the primary income 
balance and, to a lesser extent, in capital transfers. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Activity is expected to continue on a moderate 
upward path, with growth rates projected to come 
close to 1¾% in 2007 and possibly more in 2008. 
In 2007 and 2008, domestic demand is expected to 
show more resilience than in 2006. Investment will no 
longer dragging down GDP growth already in 2007, 
though its pace will crucially depend on the strength 

of demand prospects and the degree of consolidation 
in firms' balance sheets. At the same time, the 
adjustment in the constructio
n sector does not seem to 
be fully over. The projected behaviour of household 

consumption assumes tighter financial conditions 
against high levels of indebtedness and limited growth 
of labour income and social transfers.  
The external sector is projected to continue making a 
positive contribution to GDP 
growth over the forecast 
period, though lower than in 2006. Benefiting from a 
still favourable external demand outlook, exports 

could grow at a quick pace, albeit less rapidly than in 
2006, possibly helped also by an apparent orientation 
towards fast-growing markets. Yet the ongoing 

adjustments in a number 
of exporting sectors add 
uncertainty to this scenario. Import expansion is 
forecast to be moderate, reflecting the domestic 

demand outlook.  
The projected trade developments, together with the 
assumed more benign oil prices developments in 
2007, should contribute to a gradually narrowing 

current account deficit. 
However, the improvement 
will be partly offset by a higher primary income 
deficit deriving from the rising external debt.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
After climbing in recent year
s, the unemployment rate 
is now expected to stabilise at almost 7¾% over the 
forecast period, possibly dec
lining somewhat in 2008. 
Thus, wage growth is projected to remain contained. 
In 2006, inflation rebounded to 3% as a result of high 
import prices and tax hikes in 2005. In 2007 and 
2008, inflation is forecast to
 fall to some 2¼%, helped 
by subdued demand at home and moderation in 
import prices. Overall, price,
 and to some extent cost, 
developments continue to be more adverse than in a 

number of trade partners, albeit by a narrowing 
margin. 
Public finances 
In 2006, the general government deficit represented 
3.9% of GDP, down from 6.1% of GDP in 2005 and 

better than the 4.6% of GDP targeted in the stability 
programme of December 20
05. Tax proceeds were 
brisk, especially thanks 
to the increase in the VAT 
standard rate by 2 percentage points in mid-2005, 
with the revenue buoyancy being further helped by 

increases in other indirect taxes, cuts on tax benefits 
and improvements in revenue collection. At the same

 time, after a shortfall in 2005, dividends from state-
owned enterprises grew strongly. On the spending 
side, current primary expenditure fell in terms of 

GDP, reflecting the marked slowdown observed in 
various areas. Capital spending declined considerably. 
For 2007, assuming that in the coming years all 
planned capital injections in hospitals will be recorded 

as deficit-increasing operations, the government 
deficit is forecast to decline to 3½% of GDP. Tax 
receipts are forecast to grow somewhat more 

moderately than in previous years as they will no 
longer benefit from large increases in rates and the 
domestic demand upturn is projected to be subdued. 

Additional revenues are exp
ected to be associated 
with higher social contributions paid by government 
employees and marginal ch
anges in some taxes. 
Concerning expenditures, a continuation of moderate 
growth of primary spending
 is forecast. Compensation 
of government employees will be contained through 

below-inflation wage growth
, a freeze of seniority pay 
increases and a reduction in employment; the latter 
owing to an only partial replacement of workers who 
leave central government. At the same time, social 

transfers are projected to decelerate gradually over the 
medium term on the back of changes in old-age 
pension rules, especially for government employees, 

curbs on early retirement a
nd the projected labour 
market recovery. Lower expenditure for medication is 
expected. Interest expenditure will increase with 

rising debt levels and interest rates. 
In 2008, on the basis of unchanged policies, the 
government deficit is forecast to fall to 3¼% of GDP. 
Consolidation measures al
ready in place, notably 
those on central government employment and old-age 
pensions are projected to allow expenditure growing 
less than GDP. 
Still high deficits and low nominal GDP growth will 
lead to the government debt ratio increasing over the 
forecast period, although at a diminishing pace.

Activity in 2006
 After a slowdown in 2005, mainly due to the negative 
impact of floods, real GDP growth picked up to 7.7% 
in 2006, as compared to 4.
1% in the previous year. 
This above-potential growth performance is mainly 
driven by strong domestic demand, especially private 
consumption, due to wage growth and a sharp 

increase in domestic credit availability. Also 
investment was strong, supported by considerable FDI 
inflows, flood repairs an
d the acceleration of public 
investment projects. From the supply side, whereas 
services were the largest contributor to GDP growth, 
the highest growth rates were recorded in the 

construction sector.  
Strong domestic demand has resulted in a further 
widening of the trade deficit to 12.1% of GDP in 
2006, up from 9.8% in 2005. Thus, net exports 

contributed negatively to growth, notwithstanding 
increasing current transfers from abroad. The current 
account deficit widened, r
eaching 10.3% of GDP in 
2006, 90% of which was covered by FDI and capital 
transfers.  
Consumer price inflation declined to 6.6%, but the 
disinflation process slowed despite the drop in food 
prices, the lowering of the world market price of oil 
and the fall in import prices caused by the real 

appreciation of the domestic currency. 
In spite of the contraction of several labour-intensive 
industries (especially textiles and clothing), 
employment recorded a high growth rate in 2006 of 

2.8%, the increase coming on the back of buoyant 
economic activity, sustai
ned FDI inflows and a
 reduction of the informal labour market due to the tax 
reform in 2005.  
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Real GDP growth is expected
 to decelerate from 7.7% 
in 2006 to 6.3% in 2008. Industrial activity is 

projected to remain resilient against the backdrop of 
the challenges posed by EU accession and the 
redirection of output growth towards higher value-

added sectors.  
Strong domestic demand dynamics are foreseen to 
persist over the forecast period. Gross fixed capital 
formation is expected to grow robustly, by around 

14% annually, outpacing the growth in consumption 
expenditure, on the back of continued FDI inflows 
and public investment. Private consumption growth 

will remain buoyant due to high wage growth and 
surging credit growth, both in leu and foreign 
currency. Public consumption is expected to record a 

steady expansion, mainly dr
iven by an increase in 
wages and social transfers.  
Annual average consumer price inflation is expected 
to gradually decline to around 4.5% in 2008, 
consistent with a relatively tight monetary policy. In 
addition, falling import prices thanks to the 

appreciation of the 
currency and a slow adjustment of 
administered prices towards 
cost-recovery levels will 
help contain inflation. However, the fiscal stimulus, 

the evolution of credit growth and the evolution of 
public sector wages will put some upward pressures 
on inflation from the demand side.  
An increase in employment of about 1% is anticipated 
over the forecast period, which is lower than in 2006, 
but higher than the modest increases of around 0.3% 
in 2004-2005. The job creati
on process in the private 
sector will be sustained by high foreign investments 
and a further reduction of
 the informal economy, 
offsetting the ongoing lay-offs in state-owned 

enterprises and some labour
-intensive industries.  
Robust domestic demand, supported by buoyant credit 
expansion and the appreciation of the currency 
fuelling imports as well as the envisaged loosening of 
fiscal policy are likely to contribute to a further 
widening of the current account deficit, which is 

expected to reach 12.3% of 
GDP in 2008, in spite of 
increased EU transfers and higher remittances from

linked to EU funds will 
mitigate the impact on the external balance.  
Public finance 
Despite higher revenues thanks to higher-than-
expected growth, the 2006 general government deficit 

increased to 1.9% of GDP,
 compared with 1.4% in 
2005, mainly owing to an increase in public wages, 
government consumption of goods and services and 

social transfers
i. The 2007 budget foresees a pro-
cyclical expansion. As a consequence, the deficit may 
increase to 3.2% of GDP and is expected to remain at 

the same level in 2008. Over the forecast period, 
revenues from direct taxes are projected to increase 
relative to GDP, fuelled by favourable 

macroeconomic conditions and the continued efforts 
to broaden the tax base and to improve tax collection. 
However, the increasingly relaxed expenditure policy 

will cause considerably higher current spending, 
notably on social transfers and wages, as well as in 
capital expenditure, even though implementation 
difficulties might not allow the government's 
ambitious investment programme to be met. 

Furthermore, uncertainties over the additional 
budgetary impact of the Pr
operty Fund scheme for 
compensation of citizens 
for the non-return of 
confiscated property may exacerbate budgetary 
pressures. The stock of public debt is expected to 
remain stable at around 13% of GDP, mainly thanks 

to strong nominal GDP growth.

Slovenia - Price and wage developments
Activity xin 2006 
The GDP growth of the Sl
ovenian economy in 2006 
was 5.2% in real terms. It 
was its highest growth rate 
since 1999, despite the rise in oil prices.  
The main impetus for the economy in 2006 came 
from an impressive build-up of gross fixed capital. In 
particular, investment in equipment, related to 
production restructuring to improve competitiveness 

in the context of the adoption of the euro, was 
buoyant. In addition, construction increased at a 
similar pace, inter alia, than
ks to the booming housing 
component as well as intense motorway construction. 
At the same time, private consumption remained 
strong. On the other hand, external demand acted as a 

drag on GDP growth because of the increased import 
penetration, partly linked to the strong demand for 
investment goods. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
In 2007, real GDP growth is projected to decelerate to 
4.3%. Households are likely to continue increasing 
their consumption at a solid pace, thanks in part to the 
impact of the personal income tax reform, which 
curbs taxation progression by reducing the number of 
tax brackets from five to three and capping the top tax 

rate at 41%, down from 50%. Investment expenditure 
by firms is expected to decelerate significantly after 
the exceptionally high growth rate in 2006. Gross 

fixed capital formation, however, is anticipated to stay 
robust on account of strong construction activity. 
Housing construction, in particular, is forecast to 

continue increasing strongly until 2008, when the 
transition period allowing a reduced VAT rate for 
housing expires. Furthermore, a major investment in 
highway construction is planned. Export expansion is 
expected to decelerate sligh
tly in view of a somewhat 
less favourable external environment. However it will 
remain robust due inter alia to the increased 
production capacity of the car industry. Imports are 

projected to decelerate to a 
greater extent on the back 
of the slowdown of investment, resulting in a small 
positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth.  
The projections foresee a furt
her slight deceleration of 
economic growth in 2008 with output increasing by 
4.0%, in line with the production potential of the 
Slovenian economy. Private consumption is forecast 

to weaken somewhat but remaining buoyant. 
Similarly, investment is expected to continue to slow 
down due to the anticipat
ed decrease in public 
investment activity. Consequently, imports are 
projected to slowdown moderately matching the 
deceleration in external de
mand, so that the small 
positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth 
will remain stable. The current account deficit is 
projected to decline, approaching 2% of GDP.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
During the first eight months of 2006, a smooth 
disinflationary trend was interrupted by rising oil 
prices. Nonetheless, the annual inflation rate for 2006 

was 2.5%, unchanged compared with 2005. The 
possibility of counteracting the adverse effects of high 
oil prices by adjusting the excise taxes on energy 

products has not been available since July 2005, when 
the lowest level of taxes allowed by EU legislation 
was reached.  
The consumer price level increase is projected to 
stabilise around its 2006 level throughout the forecast 
period, given the moderation of aggregate demand 
and the containment of unit labour cost increases at 

relatively low levels. Apart from oil prices, however, 
inflation prospects are vulnerable to the liberalisation 
of the electricity and natural gas market for 

households planned for 1 July 2007. Moreover, there 
are uncertainties related to the potential increase in 
VAT rates, which could add some 0.8 percentage 
points to the rate of inflation in the year when the new 
regime comes into effect.  
The unemployment rate of 6% in 2006 is a result of 
the situation in the labour market having markedly 
improved on the back of solid economic activity. The

 unemployment rate is expect
ed to decrease slightly 
following moderate increases in employment and 
labour supply throughout th
e forecast period. Wage 
developments are expected to mirror the strong 
increase in labour productivity and moderating 
inflation expectations.  
Public finances 
In 2006, the general government deficit was 1.4% of 
GDP, broadly unchanged compared to 2005. Thanks 
to positive economic development current revenues 
continued to be buoyant; however this was almost 

entirely offset by a significant increase in current 
expenditure. A similar deficit at 1½% of GDP is 
forecast for 2007 as the 
deceleration in the tax 
revenue linked to the extensive tax reforms will be 
matched by moderate increase in expenditure. The 
government deficit ratio in 2008 is expected to be 

maintained at the 2006 and 2007 level. The main risks 
to this budgetary forecast are linked to the uncertainty 
about the final impact of
 the above-mentioned tax 
reforms, which can result in lower or higher revenues 
compared to official proj
ections. Over the forecast 
horizon, the general government debt is expected to 
stay stable below 30% of GDP.

Activity in 2006 
Economic growth in 2006 
accelerated rapidly, to 
around 8¼% from the 6% recorded in 2005. It was 
mainly driven by domestic demand, particularly by 

investment and private consumption, but the external 
growth contribution also entered positive territory. 
Private consumption expenditure increased by some 
6% benefiting from strong wage and employment 

growth. Gross fixed capital formation growth 
decelerated by some 10 percentage points, as some 
big investment projects in the corporate sector were 

finalised in the first half of the year, but remained 
strong at around 7¼%. The positive contribution of 
net exports was induced by a rapid acceleration of real 

export growth to above 
20% as newly built export 
capacities in the automotive and electronics sectors 
entered production in the course of the year. 
Accelerating real exports 
have had only a limited 
positive impact on the goods and services balance 
which, nevertheless, contributed to a decline in net 
borrowing from the rest of the world to below 8% of 
GDP in 2006. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Economic expansion is expected to accelerate to 
around 8½% in 2007 and then
 to decelerat
e to around 
6½% in 2008.  Domestic demand is likely to remain 
the main driving force, while the positive external 
contribution should peak in 2007, when the growth 

contribution of new export capacities should be fully 
realised.  A further improving labour market situation combined 
with strong credit growth is expected to continue to 
support private consumption growth, which, despite 

slowing down, should remain at well above 5% over 
the forecast period. Gross fixed capital formation 
should remain healthy at around 7% and 6% in 2007 

and 2008 thanks to additional foreign direct 
investments in the electronics sector.  
Decelerating investment 
and consumption should 
contribute to a slowdown in import growth. As 

exports are expected to continue to outpace imports 
over the forecast horizon the trade deficit should 
decrease significantly and thus contribute to a 

decrease in net borrowing in 2007 and 2008.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
Total employment increased by 2¼% in 2006 while 
the unemployment rate fell by almost 3 percentage 
points to below 14%. Similar, though slower, trends 

are anticipated in 2007 and 2008 as strong domestic 
demand and newly built export production capacities 
are expected to continue to provide additional 
employment opportunities. Thanks to significant 
productivity increases, nominal unit labour costs are 

expected to only increase moderately over the forecast 
horizon despite strong wage growth.   
Adjustments in administered 
prices at the end of 2005 
induced by rising energy pri
ces led to an increase in 
average annual HICP inflati
on to some 4¼% in 2006. 
Due to lower increases in regulated prices in the 
energy sector and substantial exchange rate 

appreciation over the last 
six months, HICP inflation 
is anticipated to drop to below 2% in 2007. Assuming 
that only moderate adjustme
nts in administered prices 
are implemented in 2008 an
d that the exchange rate 
remains around current levels, annual average HICP 
inflation is forecast to 
increase to around 2½% in 
2008. 
Public finances 
A pension reform was launched in 2005, affecting 
social contributions by redirecting 9% of gross wages 
to a funded (second) pension pillar. Due to a gradual 
transition and strong partic
ipation in this scheme, 
these revenue transfers are estimated to have 

increased from some ¾% of GDP in 2005 to almost 
1¼% of GDP in 2006 and should stay at that level in 
2007 and 2008.

The January 2006 increases in excise taxes on 
cigarettes and alcohol induced a large accumulation of 
stocks of these products by consumers and enterprises 

at the end of 2005 which was not foreseen in the 2006 
budget and had a negative impact on tax revenues in 
2006 of around ¼% of GDP. Nevertheless, higher-

than-expected GDP and employment growth 
combined with lower interest expenditure ensured that 
the 2006 general government deficit (including the 

pension reform costs) ended up at around 3½% of 
GDP, some ¾ percentage point below the level 
foreseen in the 2006 budget, in spite of increases in 

some public expenditure. The latter were mitigated by 
the fact that a lower-than-
expected absorption of EU 
funds eased demands on public expenditure through 

co-financing.  
Thanks to strong economic activity and restrained 
public expenditure growth, the general government 
deficit (including the pension reform costs) is 

anticipated to fall to below 3% of GDP in 2007 if the 
government thoroughly implements the 2007 budget. 
In order to respect the 3% deficit limit the government 
decided to introduce spending cuts in different areas, 

while increasing expenditures available to the 
education and social affairs ministries below nominal 
GDP growth. Nevertheless, increased health spending 

represents a downside risk for the budget. 
Under the customary no-policy-change assumption 
the budget deficit (including the pension reform costs) 
is projected to decrease 
to around 2¾% in 2008. 
Gross public debt is expected to continue falling over 
the forecast period thanks
 mainly to 
strong GDP 
growth.

Activity in 2006  
According to preliminary na
tional accounts data, real 
GDP growth accelerated to 
an exceptionally high rate 
of 5.5% in 2006. However, in terms of quarterly 

developments, growth progre
ssively decelerated over 
the year, slowing down from 6% in the first two 
quarters to 4½ % y-o-y in the final quarter of 2006. 

Growth in the second and third quarters was partly 
influenced by a base effect from a production 
stoppage in the paper indust
ry a year earlier. The base 
effect on GDP growth for th
e full year is estimated at 
about 1 percentage point. 
The acceleration of growth in
 2006 was driven by net 
exports, which contributed 2½ percentage points to 

the overall growth of GDP. The contribution from 
domestic demand was slightly lower than in 2005, due 
to slower private consumption growth. On the other 

hand, investment growth ac
celerated on the back of 
lively equipment and housing investment.   
Prospects for 2007 and 2008  
Economic growth is forecast to moderate from the 
cyclical peak in 2006, but still remains close to its 
estimated potential of about 3%. While the 
contribution from net exports is expected to remain 

strong over the forecast period, it should nevertheless 
drop significantly from the extraordinary export 
performance in 2006. Indus
try surveys indicate that 
the metal engineering industry will remain the main 
driver of exports, while export prospects in the paper 
industry and in the traditionally volatile electronics 

industry appear less favourable over the short term. 
The relatively deep specialisation of exports in a few 
industry sectors increases 
dependency on sectoral 
conditions and prospects.  
Domestic demand is forecast 
to decelerate slightly as 
both private consumption and investment are 

predicted to slow. While investment in equipment and 
machinery is expected to 
remain on a steady growth 
path, supported by the delivery of nuclear plant 

equipment, construction investment will abate, 
primarily due to the expected cooling in the housing 
market. The main stimulus 
to growth over the forecast 
period is expected to come from private consumption. 
Household confidence has remained above the long-
term average during the first months of 2007, boosted 

by rapid employment growth and firm prospects for 
real disposable income 
developments. In 2007, 
disposable income will be supported by substantial 

tax cuts. Nevertheless, private consumption is forecast 
to be on a slightly declining trend as employment 
growth will slow. In addition, rising interest rates and 

a relatively high debt burden will curb consumer 
spending in the medium term.  
Public consumption growth
 is forecast to remain 
moderate, given the efforts of the central government 
to control expenditure and following the programme 
to boost productivity in the public sector.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
After strong annual incr
eases of 1½ % over 2005-
2006, employment growth is set to slow to about 1% 
in 2007 and further to below 1% in 2008. Strong 
demand for labour has persisted at the beginning of 

2007, but employment growth is expected to be 
constrained in the medium term by structural 
mismatches on the labour market, decelerating 

activity and slowing growth of the working-age 
population, signalling the e
ffects from the ageing of 
the population kicking in. The unemployment rate is 

forecast to remain on a st
eadily declining path to 
settle under 7% of the labour force by 2008, helped by 
a still relatively buoyant demand for labour and active 

labour market measures. La
bour shortages are evident 
in some industrial, construction and service branches 
and the number of job vacancies has been rising for 
the past several years. Nevertheless, the labour market 
bottlenecks have not led to a noticeable wage drift as 

wages have remained strongly guided by the current 
central wage agreement, which extends until the end 
of September 2007. The forecast assumes that the 

next wage agreement will 
yield an acceleration in

wage growth in 2008, reflecting the tight labour 
market conditions in some sectors. As a result, unit 
labour costs will embark on 
a clearly rising trend.  
Finland recorded the lowest HICP inflation rates in 
the euro area in 2004-2006.
 Apart from special one-
off factors, this has resulted from Finnish price levels 
being about one fifth higher 
than in the euro area on 
average, which has left room for competition-induced 
price moderation. HICP inflation is forecast to 
increase marginally over the forecast period from the 

1.3% recorded in 2006, mainly driven by housing-
related costs and services 
price rises. In 2008, the 
predicted hike in unit labour costs will add to 

inflationary pressures.  
Public finances  
The general government surplus in 2006 reached 
3.9% of GDP, 1 percentage point higher than what 
was expected in the previo
us autumn forecast. Over 
half of the difference orig
inates from the social 
security sector, which benefited from a sharp rise in 
revenue from social cont
ributions. The central and 
local governments also r
ecorded stronger fiscal 
balances on the back of strong tax and non-tax 
revenues and expenditure restraint. The higher surplus 
will carry over to 2007 and 2008. The surplus is 

forecast to remain slightly
 above 3½ % of GDP over 
2007-2008 under a no-policy-change assumption. No 
new tax or expenditure measures (which might be 

taken by the new government that took office in 
spring 2007) are assumed for 2008, apart from the 
usual inflation adjustment to income tax scales. 
The government debt ratio is projected to decline 
steeply, to about 35% of GDP, by the end of the 
forecast period.  26. Sweden Continued steady growth and high fiscal surpluses

Activity in 2006 
In 2006, economic activity a
ccelerated strongly, with 
real GDP growing by 4.4% compared with 2.9% in 
2005. The pick-up has been broad-based with both 

solid private consumption growth and a positive 
investment cycle supporting domestic demand. In 
addition, net exports contributed significantly to 

growth owing notably to higher exports of goods. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
In the coming two years, th
e economy is projected to 
continue growing steadily, though at a slower speed. 
GDP growth is projected to
 decelerate gradually to 
about 3¾% in 2007 and 3¼% in 2008, slightly above 
potential growth. Private consumption is expected to 
accelerate further and conso
lidate its position as the 
main driver of GDP growth. Investments are bound to 
subside somewhat after expanding strongly in recent 
years, but high capacity utilisation and strong balance 

sheets in the private sector are still anticipated to 
provide continued momentum. Moreover, net exports 
are expected to further add to growth, albeit only 
marginally, as export market growth is set to 
moderate and strong domestic demand will support 

imports. 
The steady growth in private consumption is 
supported by the resumption of employment growth, 
lower taxes on labour income and higher real wages, 

which contribute positively to household disposable 
income. While households have taken on more debt, 
financial wealth has benefited from rising equity and 

property prices, contributing to the maintenance of a 
relatively strong net wea
lth position. A gradual 
reduction of the saving rate is likely to materialise 
over the forecast period. 
Finally, growth of public consumption is projected to 
add support to GDP growth, reflecting in particular 

the strong public finance situation at local level.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The continuing strong pace of economic activity over 
the forecast period is expected to be accompanied by 
a moderation in labour productivity growth as the 

cyclical impulse moderates. After a period of 
weakness, private sector employment growth is 
expected to build on the improved situation in 2006 

and to remain dynamic over the forecast period. The 
measures adopted by the new government in the 
autumn of 2006 are set to provide additional impetus 

to the labour market. The 
measures are mainly aimed 
at increasing labour supply and employment via 
changes in tax and benefit systems. Overall, 

employment is foreseen to grow strongly over the 
forecast period and unemployment is expected to fall 
to below 6% of the labour force in 2008.  
The weak developments in the labour market over the 
last few years have helped to contain wage demands. 
High profitability in the private sector together with 

the improving labour market situation and emerging 
labour shortages in a few sectors (construction and 
services) is estimated to lead to higher wage growth 

over the forecast period. This pick-up is corroborated 
by the outcome of the sector
al agreements in the 2007 
private sector wage negotiation round that have been 

concluded so far. 
Overall, inflationary pressures remain relatively 
subdued with underlying inflation rising gradually 
over the forecast period. In the near term, lower 

energy prices, a stronger
 Swedish krona and price 
pressure on imported goods will help keep inflation 
low. In the second half of 2007, however, inflation is 

expected to increase as these effects fade out and 
domestic inflationary pressures build up, following in 
particular from continued robust growth and higher 

real wages. Given the outlook for inflation, the 
Riksbank started to raise interest rates in 2006 and is 
expected to go on raising rates in 2007 and 2008 
towards more neutral levels. In line with the newly 
adopted communication policy to publish its own 

forecast for the repo rate, this path towards higher

rates has been confirmed by the Riksbank and further 
moderate hikes have been signalled for 2007.  
Public finances 
In 2006, public finances developed favourably. 
Despite a somewhat expansionary budget for 2006 

(including tax cuts and increases in certain active 
labour market programmes), strong economic growth, 
higher-than-foreseen tax revenues and lower 

expenditures for unemployment and illness at work 
limited the net impact on 
the budget balance. As a 
result, the 2006 budget surplus slightly exceeded the 

surplus recorded the previ
ous year, at 2.2% of GDP 
compared with 2.1% in 2005
 (taking into account the 
reclassification of second-pillar funded pension 

schemes in the private sector as from April 2007).  
This positive underlying trend is projected to spill 
over to both 2007 and 2008, allowing surpluses to 
remain high despite the fairly expansionary 2007 

budget proposed by the new government. The budget 
includes substantial tax cuts, notably reduction in 
taxation of labour income of about 1.3% of GDP, a 
lowering of property taxes and an abolition of wealth 

taxes, which are only partially financed through other 
revenue-increasing and expenditure-decreasing 
measures. Overall the budget
 surplus is expected to 
remain at between 2-2½% of GDP in 2007 and 2008.  
General government gross debt, mainly central 
government liabilities, is projected to continue to fall 
over the forecast period, to below 40% of GDP in 

2008. This reduction is supported by the government's 
plans to sell off stakes in various state-owned 
enterprises estimated to amount to roughly 2% of 

GDP per year.

The United Kingdom - Labour market 
Activity in 2006 
GDP grew by 2.8% in 2006, up from 1.9% in 2005 
and close to its average growth over the past ten 
years. The expansion mirrored buoyant private 

consumption expenditure and higher gross fixed 
capital formation, which contributed 1.3 p.p. and 1.0 
p.p. respectively.  
On the output side of the 
economy, the service sector 
(70% of GDP) remained th
e main driver of economic 
growth, with the financial and business services' 
sectors expanding the most rapidly. Manufacturing 

activity (13% of GDP) was up by 1½%, only slightly 
more than reversing the previous year's drop in 
output. By contrast, output from the extraction of oil 

and gas shrank by 7.9%, reducing GDP growth by 
about 0.2 percentage points.   
Growth in private consumption recovered to 2.0%, 
after its sharp slowing in 2005, mainly on the back of 

further gains in households' financial and housing 
wealth. During 2006, the FTSE all-share index rose 
by 17% and house prices increased by about 10%. 
Household disposable income rose at a slower pace 
than in 2005, contributing to a drop in the saving rate 

from 5.3% in 2005 to 4.8%. 
Investment was up by 6.5%, following weak growth 
during the first half of th
e decade, amidst signs that 
companies were building up their productive capacity 

in response to favourable demand and cost conditions.  
Trade figures continued to 
be seriously affected by 
missing trader intra-Commun
ity (MTIC) fraud. As a 
result, import and export growth figures were highly 
volatile during the year. Overall the increase in 
imports, fuelled by strong domestic demand, outpaced 
export growth, leading to a negative contribution of 

net trade to growth by 0.4 percentage point. This, 
coupled with a drop in investment income, led to a 
marked widening of the cu
rrent account deficit to 
almost 3½% of GDP. 
Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
Real GDP in 2007 is expect
ed to grow at a similar 
rate to 2006, matching potential growth, driven by 
higher private consumption 
and, to a lesser extent, 
investment. A shallow slowdown in the pace of 
economic expansion to arou
nd 2½% is forecast in 
2008, with earlier monetary tightening weighing on 

demand.  
On the output side, services are expected to grow 
closely in line with total GDP. Manufacturing output 
growth is expected to rise to a little more than 2% in 

2007, sustained by improved export orders, falling 
back slightly in 2008. By 2008, oil and gas extraction 
is expected to have increased by about 5% on 2006 
(still below the level in 2005), as production from a 
new large field and a number of smaller start-ups 

gather momentum, notwithstanding an underlying 
decline in North Sea output.  
On the demand side, private consumption expenditure 
in 2007 is expected to 
accelerate somewhat, though 
growth will remain significantly less than the average 
over the past ten years. The gains in housing and 
financial wealth in the second part of 2006, coupled 

with higher real disposable
 income, are expected to 
feed through to stronger private consumption in 2007. 
Chapter 3 
Member States, The United Kingdom 
- 105 - 
In 2008, however, consumption growth is expected to 
weaken, as higher interest rates should boost savings 
and the wealth effect from the increases in house 

prices is expected to diminish. 
Business investment is expected to remain strong in 
2007, as firms continue to build up capacity and add 
to the capital stock. Capacity constraints should 

become less conspicuous in 2008, though the increase 
in corporate and total investment is still expected to 
outpace GDP growth.  
On the external side, ne
t trade is expected to 
constitute a small negative contribution to growth 
over the forecast period. Strong growth in the UK's 
main export markets is exp
ected to contribute to an 
increase in exports (in u
nderlying terms, excluding 
MTIC fraud) of around 5½-6% in 2007 and 2008. In 
2007, the increase in the share of private consumption 

in domestic demand will dampen import growth to 
slightly less than the increase in exports, as 
consumption tends to be less import-intensive than 

investment spending.  
 Meanwhile, increasing UK net overseas liabilities, 
given continuing significant external deficits, are 

expected to reduce net investment income flows, still 
positive given average rates of return on recorded 
assets continuing to well exceed those on liabilities. 

Coupled with an expected
 increase in net current 
transfers overseas, this is 
projected to lead to a 
gradual further widening of the external deficit.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2005 and 2006 the labour
 market was characterised 
by record inflows of migrant labour and higher 
participation rates among older and female workers.  
Notwithstanding strong employment growth in 2006, 

the remarkable increase in the labour supply 
contributed to a rise in the unemployment rate to 
5.3%. Unutilised labour resources rose steadily in the 

first half of the year, but stabilised thereafter.  
Although great uncertainty on the extent of future 
immigration remains, particularly given its 
unanticipated scale over past 
three years, lower labour 
force growth and robust employment growth are 
expected to lead to a tighter labour market during the 

forecast period. Neverthe
less, unemployment will 
remain higher than the natural rate and contribute to 
dampen upward pressures on wages. Labour 
productivity growth is also expected to remain high, 
as firms seek to maximise utilisation of their present 
staffing levels.  
 
Underlying the HICP inflation rate of 2.3% for 2006 
as a whole was a sharp rise through the year from an 
average of 1.9% in the first quarter to 2.8% in the 
final quarter. Although the inflation rate rose to 2.9% 

in the first quarter of 2007, , it is expected to subside 
throughout 2007, as the impact of higher food and 
energy prices in 2006 should unwind. An average 

inflation rate of 2¼% is projected for 2007, with 
moderate wage growth curbing second-round 
inflationary effects. A more
 stable profile is forecast 
for 2008, with the rate of increase in the HICP falling 
back to the government's 2% target.  
Public finances 
Preliminary estimates indicate that the deficit for the 
2006-07 financial year
1 fell to 2.7% of GDP. Overall, 
lower-than-projected capital 
spending is expected to 
have compensated for weaker revenue growth and an 
overshoot in current expenditure. The deficit includes 
a capital transfer in relation to the cancellation of the 
debts owed by developing countries amounting to 

0.1% of GDP in 2006-07; in line with recent 
discussion between Eurostat and the Office for 
National Statistics on the recording of these 

transactions.  
The table below shows the projections for general 
government deficit and debt on a financial year basis.  
A progressive reduction in the deficit is forecast for

 The revenue-to-GDP ratio is forecast to rise by ½ p.p. 
in 2007-08 and a further ¼ p.p. in 2008-09. On the 
other hand, expenditure is projected to increase by 

0.3% of GDP in 2007-08 and to grow in line with 
GDP in the following year. 
The small improvement in the deficit in 2007-08 is 
supported by the favourable macroeconomic 

environment, which should improve the tax base and 
reduce cyclical expenditure. Discretionary measures 
adopted in December 2006, 
chiefly an increase in air 
passenger duty, are expected to boost revenues by ¼% 
of GDP. 
In April 2008, the basic rate of personal income tax 
and the main corporate tax rate will both be reduced 

by 2 p.p., but these will be more than compensated for 
by other revenue-raising measures; in addition, fiscal 
drag will contribute to the overall tax burden 

increasing in 2008/09 to about 38½% of GDP, up 
from 36½% in 2003/04. Although the expenditure 
limits for the individual departments will be set out 
only in the Comprehensive Spending Review later in 
2007, the 2007 Budget set overall spending limits 

planned to curtail real growth in current expenditure 
in 2008-09 to 2%, a
nd the forecast assumes 
observance of these limits.  
General government debt is projected to increase 
slightly during the forecast 
period, to around 44% of 
GDP by the end of 2008/09.

Croatia - GDP  and current account
 % of GDP
 %Developments in 2006 
In 2006, annual real GDP 
growth accelerated to 4.8%, 
up from 4.3% in 2005.  Private consumption grew 
moderately by 3.5%, similar to 2005, whereas public 

consumption recorded a stronger growth rate.  
Investment spending accelerat
ed markedly to 11% on 
the back of strong private sector activity.  Imports of 

goods and services grew more
 strongly than exports, 
leading to a negative contribution of net exports to 
growth.  High frequency indicators suggest a 

continuation of strong economic activity in early 
2007.   
Average annual consumer price inflation (CPI) 
slightly declined to 3.2% by end-2006 (2005: 3.3%), 

and further to 2.7% in March 2007, supported by a 
moderation of price dynamics in the areas of food, 
energy and transport.   
According to preliminary 
data, the current account 
deficit widened to around 7.7% of GDP in 2006, up 
from 6.4% in 2005.  A higher merchandise trade 
deficit as well as lower surpluses in the trade with 
services and in transfers contributed to the higher 
current account deficit.  
Prospects for 2007and 2008 
In 2007, real GDP growth is
 expected to remain at 
around 4.8%, mainly driven by strong domestic 
demand.  Private consumption growth accelerates to 
4%, as consumer confidence remains generally strong.  

Moreover, disposable incomes are set to further 
increase on the back of higher expected wages and 
social transfers. Also, si
zeable one-off payments to 
pensioners are scheduled in the context of a 
significant debt repayment scheme.  Public 
consumption growth is expected to be stronger, due to 

an already announced increase in public sector 
employment and wages.  Private investors' confidence 
will continue to be positively affected by the EU 

accession process.  Therefor
e, investment growth 
remains strong at around 8.5%, despite a high base in 
2006.  Growth dynamics are set to somewhat 

moderate in 2008, as domestic demand pressures will 
start to ease.  A relatively favourable external 
environment will support so
me acceleration of export 
growth, also supported by a stronger tourism sector.  
The growth of imports is expected to slow towards the 
end of the forecast horizon 
in line with decelerating 
domestic demand. As a result, by 2008 net exports 
will cease to post a negative contribution to growth. 
The current account deficit is expected to widen to 

above 8% of GDP in 2007, in line with stronger 
domestic demand and persistent capital inflows.  Net 
FDI inflows will be somewhat smaller, but are 
expected to "finance" a sign
ificant part of the current 
account deficit. Labour market, costs and prices 
Growth and investment dynamics will have some 
favourable effects on the labour market.  The labour 
force participation rate is set to increase by one 
percentage point per year.  Total employment will 

continue to rise, by 1.7% on average.  As a result, the 
unemployment rate (LFS) is expected to decline 
mildly by around 0.5 percentage points over the 

forecast horizon. Real wage
 growth remains stronger 
than productivity growth, leading to an increase in 
real unit labour costs, 
which is particularly 
pronounced in 2007.  A continuation of a stability-
oriented monetary framework will help maintaining 
price stability.  Due to base effects and very low 

inflation in the first quarter
 of 2007, annual average 
inflation (CPI) will temporarily decline to below 2.5% 
in 2007, but further adjustments of administrative 

prices and catching up effects will push inflation 
again up to around 3% towa
rds the end of the forecast 
horizon. 
Public finances 
In 2006, the general government deficit has 
significantly declined to 2.2% of GDP (from 3.9%), 
driven by particularly strong revenue growth and 

some moderation of spending.  In 2007, stronger

 public consumption as well as some pre-election 
social spending will prevent a further deficit 
reduction. At the same time, however, strong revenue 

growth will largely compensate for additional 
spending, and the deficit is expected to widen 
somewhat as compared to 2006.  The projected deficit 

does not include one-off payments to pensioners 
(around 1.3% of GDP) due to remaining uncertainties 
with respect to their prop
er treatment under ESA95 
accounting rules.  A continuation of moderate fiscal 
consolidation is expected for 2008, as spending 
pressures will start to ease and due to lower public 

investment growth.  The public debt-to-GDP ratio is 
set to slightly decline to below 40% of GDP by 2008. 
The scheduled use of a significant part of revenues 

from privatisation for pensioners' debt repayment 
prevents a stronger debt reduction.

 Real GDP growth and labour market 
Forecast%
%Developments in 2006 
Preliminary data point to a relatively moderate growth 
of 3.1% in 2006, compared to 3.8% in 2005. The main 
reason for this relatively moderate performance was 

lower than expected expansion in manufacturing, 
agriculture and construction. In particular, industrial 
production increased by only 2.5% in 2006. However, 

a number of indicators suggest that the final data will 
show stronger economic activity for 2006.  
Employment increased by some 4% in 2006, which 
helped to bring unemployment down to about 36% of 

the labour force. However, 
labour supply increased by 
slightly above 3%, which partly offset the impact of 
job growth on the unemployment rate.  
Inflation accelerated from 0.
5% in 2005 to 3.2% in 
2006. The main factors for this strong increase were 
higher energy prices and the increase of excise taxes 
on alcohol and tobacco towards EU levels.  
External imbalances continued to narrow during 2006. 
Like in 2005 - when high workers remittances and 
cash exchanges had helped to reduce the current 
account deficit from 7.7% of
 GDP in 2004 to -1.4% of 
GDP - the same factors helped to reduce the current 
account deficit by nearly an
other percentage point of 
GDP.  
Public finances continue to remain close to balance. 
After a slight surplus of 0.2% of GDP in 2005, the 
spring notification reported a preliminary deficit of -

0.6% of GDP in 2006. The General government debt 
declined from 46.9% of GDP 
in 2005 to 39.4% at the 
end of 2006. The main factor behind this strong 
decline was the early repayment of Paris Club debt in 
early 2006. 
Prospects in 2007 and 2008 
For 2007 and 2008, the overall scenario from the 
autumn forecast still holds. After years of weak 

growth, recent measures to proceed with structural 
reforms have resulted in an improved business 
environment and have strengthened consumer 

confidence. Thus, like in many other candidate 
countries before, domestic demand will be the main 
driving force for stronger output growth. Furthermore, 

when compared to the autumn forecast, the 
international environment should offer a somewhat 
stronger support to the country's growth dynamics, 

resulting from stronger than expected global demand, 
but also from improved perspectives for regional 
trade, due to the countr
y's membership to CEFTA 
2006.  
Given this growth supporting environment, a further 
acceleration of economic activity
 is expected by about 
one percentage point annually. This will bring GDP 
growth to about 4¼% in 2007 and 5¼% in 2008. The 
biggest contribution to this acceleration will come 

from private (domestic and foreign) investment, 
reaping the benefits of the recent measures to improve 
the business environment, to facilitate company 

registration, to simplify 
and accelerate administrative 
procedures and to reduce the tax burden by lowering 
tax rates on income and profits. As a result, the 

investment-to-GDP ratio is expected to converge 
towards levels observed in other catching-up 
economies. Private consumption will be another 

important pillar for the growth acceleration, 
benefiting from improving consumer confidence, 
increased employment and low inflation, which will 

translate into a stronger in
crease in real disposable 
income. Public consumption will remain subdued, 
reflecting the government's commitment to maintain a 

prudent fiscal policy.  
The stronger growth of domestic demand and in 
particular the high import content of investment will 
lead to a negative contribution of net-exports to GDP 
growth. As a result, the trade balance is likely to 
deteriorate However, workers remittances and other 

capital inflows, such as incr
easing FDI, are expected 
to largely finance those deficits.

 Labour market, costs and prices 
The acceleration in econom
ic activity will create 
additional employment. However, unemployment is 
likely to remain high, as a part of the new jobs might 

be filled by increased labour
 supply. As a result, the 
official unemployment rate might only slightly 
decline from some 36% in 2006 to about 35% in 

2008. Wage growth is expected to remain largely in 
line with productivity developments.  
Consumer price inflation is likely to remain below the 
level in 2006, as the inflationary impulse from higher 

energy prices and the increase in excise taxes is bound 
to fade away. During the 
forecast period, the absence 
of domestic demand pressures and the stability of the 

exchange rate towards the euro should help to contain 
inflation. However, the 
growth acceleration and the 
need to adjust electricity prices to international levels 

and excise duties to EU levels, should lead to 
somewhat higher price in
creases during 2007 and 
2008. In view of year-on-year inflation below 1% 
during the first quarter of 2007, annual inflation might 
reach some 2% in 2007, wh
ich could further rise to 
some 2½ % in 2008.  
Public finances 
The plans of the new government to reduce the tax 
burden and to promote economic growth could lead to 
a temporary increase in the general government 

deficit to slightly above 1% in 2007. The plans to 
increase spending in human capital and administrative 
capacities could lead to a further rise in the deficit to 

some 1½% of GDP in 2008. The combination of 
strong economic growth, early debt repayments and 
relatively low deficits will lead to a further reduction 

of the debt ratio towards 32% of GDP by 2008.

 %Forecast
Recent economic developments 
Real GDP growth fell from 7½% in 2005 to 6% in 
2006, chiefly due to weak
er private consumption, 
which was partly driven by the tighter monetary 

stance, higher interest rate
s and lower lending. Public 
consumption and investment increased by 
respectively 9½% and 14% in 2006. Contributions of 

the external sector changed substantially. Imports 
grew at 7% in 2006, down significantly from 11½% 
in 2005.  Export growth amounted to 8½% in both 

2005 and 2006. 
Inflation increased significantly following the 
financial turbulence in early 2006, in large part due to 
a weaker Turkish currency and continued upward 

price pressures, including in the service sector.  As a 
result, consumer price inflation increased to 9½% in 
December 2006, far above the 
year-end target of 5%. 
Meanwhile high real interest rates - of above 10% per 
annum - have invited large capital inflows and put 
upward pressure on the Turkish lira. 
After three years of strong growth with almost no job 
creation, employment started to rise since 2005 by 
roughly 1
% annually.  The labour force 
participation rate increased slightly to 47½% in 
December 2006. These trends together led to a small 
fall in the unemployment rate to below 10%.   
The current account deficit widened Œ partly 
reflecting strong domestic demand in the first half of 
the year - from 6½% of GDP in 2005 to about 7¾ % 
in 2006. FDI-inflows increas
ed sharply, and covered 
about half of the total 2006 current account deficit. 
Prospects in 2007 to 2008 
The overall picture for th
e forecasting period looks 
favourable.  Turkey should be
 able to increase export 
growth - in particular in tourism - while the tight 

monetary and fiscal policy mix will support the 
disinflation process.   
A gradual decline in inflationary pressures will allow 
a fall in interest rates and improve the investment 

climate.  Overall, economic ac
tivity is expected to rise 
by about 5% in 2007 and 5¾% in 2008.  Output 
growth is expected to be increasingly balanced, with 

private investment and net exports outpacing overall 
growth.   
Along with the declining inflation, growth of 
disposable income will accelerate, which allows the 

private sector increase consumption growth from 3¾ 
in 2007 to 5½% in 2008.  Fixed investment will 
continue to benefit from reduced macroeconomic and 

political uncertainty - in particular after the 2007 
elections - and declining real interest rates.   
On the other hand, the build-up of stocks is slowing 
down considerably.  Strong investment and higher 
consumption growth will lead to continued high 
growth of imports, in particular of consumer durables 

and capital goods.  Exports should benefit from 
diversification and quality improvements resulting 
from earlier high investments.  Parliamentary and 

Presidential elections are 
due in 2007. Any possible 
impact stemming from policy changes in the context 
of political events has not been incorporated in the 

current forecast. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
In line with the robust economic growth, employment 
is forecast to increase by about 1½% per year.  This 
will lead to a slight reduction of the unemployment 

rate from 10% in 2005 to 9½% in 2008.  
The trend in declining inflationary pressures is likely 
to continue as from 2007.  Fiscal discipline and a 
rising credibility of the Central Bank™s disinflation 

targets are important elements in this respect. 12-
month consumer price inflation is expected to fall 
below 6½% by the end of 2007 and to 5% at the end 
of 2008.  However, high oil and services prices might 
slow down the disinflation process in 2007-2008.

 Growth of imports will remain strong, partially 
reflecting a rather high import content of exports.  
Exports will gradually start 
benefiting from a weaker 
currency.  The current acco
unt deficit is therefore 
forecast to stabilize around 
7% of GDP in 2007-2008.  
A higher surplus of the services balance should 

contribute to maintain positive medium-term 
prospects in the external sector.  
Public finances  
Public finances remained largely on track, achieving a 
primary surplus of 6½% of GDP in 2006.  This 

substantial surplus and strong GDP growth led to a 
reduction in the debt ratio, from 69½% of GDP at the 
end of 2005 to 60½% at the end of 2006.  General 

government interest payments have fallen from about 
17% of GDP in 2003 to 7½% of GDP in 2006. In the 
election year 2007 and in 2008, public sector balances 

will be affected by higher interest rates, higher public 
spending and a slowdown in privatisation. 
Conversely, the ongoing public finance reforms will 
help to widen the tax base and to increase the 
efficiency of tax collection.  Non-interest 

expenditures are seen to remain largely constant 
relative to GDP.  The general government balance is 
expected to change from a surplus of ½% of GDP in 

2006 to a deficit of 1% of GDP in 2007-2008.  
General government debt is expected to further 
decline gradually, albeit at
 a decelerating pace, to 
about 55% in 2008. The government has been making 

progress in lengthening the average maturity and 
swapping foreign denominated into lira denominated 
debt. However, Turkey pays relatively high interest 

rates on its debt, which highlights Turkey's relative 
high vulnerability to interest and exchange rate 
volatility and rollover risk as the average maturity of 

its domestic debt remains short (at 28 months).

Less housing investment lowered growth in 2006  
After three years of rapid expansion the US economy 
moved to a growth path below trend in 2006. The 
3.3% annual growth rate reflects the very high growth 

rate in the first quarter and hides the subsequent 
downshifting of the expansion. 
The slowdown was concentrated
 in the housing sector 
which cooled down substantially from the preceding 

boom years. Residential investment dropped by close 
to 20% annualised in the second half of the year 
which subtracted 1.2 percentage points from quarterly 

GDP growth rates. But manufacturing, in particular 
the automotive sector, also 
cooled down as companies 
tried to reduce their elevated inventories. 
House price appreciation declined significantly in the 
course of 2006. Some data
 indicate that the average 
level of house prices even started to fall. Nevertheless, 
consumer spending continued to increase briskly 

based on solid gains in real disposable income and a 
further decline in the personal saving rate. While non-
residential construction activity picked up after many 
years of sluggish growth, business equipment 
investment started to show signs of weakness. The 

trade performance improved as export growth rose 
and import growth fell in volume terms. However, the 
contribution of net exports to GDP growth was zero.  
Solid employment growth reduced the unemployment 
rate to new lows for the cycle in 2006, but generated 
only little upward pressure on wages. Inflationary 
pressures remained contained with the price index of 

core personal consumption expenditure showing a 
2.1% year-on-year increase 
in December. The current 
account deficit remained broadly unchanged above 
6% of GDP while the fiscal deficit of general 
government receded to 2.3% of GDP. The 

improvement in the fiscal position was due to 
continued strength in tax revenue growth. 
The mid-cycle slowdown continues in 2007 
The outlook for this year and next depends crucially 
on how much more the housing sector will cool down 

and how strong the spill-over effects to the rest of the 
economy will be. In view of the large overhang of 
unsold homes, the forecast 
projects that residential 
construction will decline throughout 2007. Its share of 
GDP will fall from the historically high level of 5.5% 
in 2005 to 4.3% this year (in 2000 prices), which is 

slightly below the level before the onset of the recent 
building boom. This correction alone would subtract 
two thirds of a percentage point from annual GDP 

growth. Following the pattern of previous building 
cycles, it is assumed that the sector will rebound next 
year (see Graph 5.1). This should be instrumental in 

lifting GDP growth back to around potential in 2008 
and thereby ending the mid-cycle slowdown. 
The downsizing of residential investment started to 
spill over into business equipment investment in the 
second half of last year
. This GDP component is 
expected to remain weak in 2007 although favourable 

financial conditions and relatively high capacity 
utilisation will be supportive. Consumer spending 
growth was still solid in the first quarter of 2007, but 

should gradually be dampened down by falling house 
prices and slower employment growth. 
Export growth should remain at a relatively high level 
over the forecast period helped by solidly expanding 

world markets. Import growth, on the other hand, is 
expected to be relatively subdued, reflecting mainly 
the path of domestic demand. The lagged effects of 

previous dollar depreciation are supporting these 
trends in export and import growth. The contribution 
of net exports to GDP growth should be positive in 

2007 before returning to neutral in the following year. 
Although GDP growth is expected to remain below 
long-term potential through 2007, the economy is not 
expected to enter a downward spiral into recession. 
Since inflationary pressures have remained relatively 
contained and should moderate over time, the Federal 

Reserve is likely to support output growth by 
lowering short-term interest rates.

Prospects for 2007 and 2008 
The forecast projects the an
nualised quarterly GDP 
growth rates to remain below 2½% throughout 2007 
resulting in a 2.2% annual growth rate. Next year, 

when the contractionary effects of the housing 
correction subside, GDP growth should be half a 
percentage point higher and thereby close to its long-

run potential. Consumer spending growth is expected 
to fall substantially in the coming quarters and remain 
below disposable income growth also in 2008. 

Consequently, the household saving rate would return 
to a small positive number by next year. 
Unemployment is projected to react with a 
considerable lag to the mid-cycle slowdown and rise 

to 5% only next year when headline inflation falls 
below 2%. The fiscal deficit of general government 
will widen again to almost 3% of GDP, particularly 

because tax revenues are pr
ojected to normalise to 
single-digit growth rates. The improving trade 
performance will reduce th
e current account deficit 
slightly this year. But next year, a deteriorating net 
investment income balance will raise the current 

account deficit back to 
6% of GDP in national 
account terms.  
The risks to the growth forecast seem to be tilted to 
the downside. The housing correction may have to be 

deeper and longer-lasting than projected. Its spill-over 
to the rest of the economy c
ould also be stronger than 
assumed, particularly if the current problems in the 

sub-prime mortgage market should worsen and 
spread. Inflationary pressures may turn out to be more 
stubborn than antic
ipated and postpone an easing of 
monetary policy. There also continue to be risks 
associated with the large cu
rrent account deficit and a 
possible disruptive adjustment
. On the upside, there is 
the possibility that the housing correction and its 
overall impact will be weaker than outlined above.

Economic expansion showed resilience in 2006 
Annual GDP growth in Japan remained robust at 
2.2% in 2006, despite going through a soft patch in 
the third quarter of the year, when the economy barely 

grew at all. GDP growth recovered strongly in the 
fourth quarter, mainly thanks to a rebound in private 
consumption, which unexpectedly declined in the 

third quarter. In 2006 as a whole, private domestic 
demand, and business investment in particular, 
remained the main engine of GDP growth, while net 

exports also contributed positively. Economic growth 
in 2006 turned out significantly lower than previously 
assumed, but this is mainly explained by significant 

data revisions.   
Favourable fundamentals for 2007 and 2008  
Looking ahead, Japan's economic expansion is set to 
continue. Private consumption is forecast to re-
accelerate in 2007 and 200
8, on the back of a 
favourable situation in the labour market. The 
unemployment rate is at an eight-year low of 4%. 
This, combined with a healthy situation in the 
corporate sector, means that
 average wage income is 
expected to start rising in the near future. In addition, 

the tax burden on households
 is expected to decrease 
in the financial year 2007, which should contribute to 
stronger growth in household disposable income.  
On the corporate front, the quarterly April 2007 
Tankan survey showed continued high and 
widespread confidence in all sectors. Capacity 
utilisation rate in the manufacturing sector is high, 

especially in the machiner
y industry sector. Corporate
 earnings are strong, in particular in the export sector, 
and are expected to remain 
so in the coming quarters. 
The inventory correction seems to be proceeding 
gradually. Although there are still some concerns 

about the inventory situation in the IT sector, the 
adjustment in the manufacturing sector as a whole 
seems well under way. In combination with a sound 

corporate financial situation and resilient external 
demand, mainly from the rest of Asia, business 
investment is forecast to remain dynamic. On the back 

of rising land prices after several years of decline, 
residential investment grow
th is forecast to resume. 
On the external side, net exports are expected to 
continue to support GDP growth in the near future, 

partly as a result of the lagged
 effect of last year's yen 
depreciation. The contribution 
of the external sector to 
the economic expansion is, however, projected to 

decelerate thereafter, as the acceleration in imports 
will partially offset the strength of exports.
 With the 
income account now acco
unting for 2/3 of the 
Japanese current account su
rplus and expected to 
further increase in the forecast horizon, the current 
account surplus is al
so forecast to continue to enlarge 
from 3.9% of GDP in 2006 to around 4.0% in 2007 
and 2008. 
 All in all, GDP growth 
is expected to accelerate 
slightly from 2.2% to 2.3% in 2007, before 
moderating to 2.1% in 2008 Œ still above Japan's 
potential growth rate. 
Price developments and monetary policy 
Deflation has almost come to an end. The CPI has 
been fluctuating around zero for some months but the 
GDP deflator remains slightly negative. Headline and 
core CPI were back in negative territory in February. 

Excluding food and energy
, consumer prices also 
continue to decline. The negative developments in 
inflation figures are expected to be temporary. While 

the various measures of annual inflation are forecast 
to be close to zero on average in 2007, they are 
expected increase gradually in the course of 2008, 

albeit remaining below 0.5%.  
In February 2007, the Bank of Japan raised its policy 
rate by 25 basis points to 0.5% in a move mainly 
intended to safeguard its forward-looking approach, 
but the accompanying statement was widely perceived 
as dovish. While the Bank of Japan is engaged in a 

process of gradual normalisation of monetary policy, 
recent weak data on inflati
on makes it unlikely that it

will tighten monetary policy aggressively in the 
coming months.  
Public finances remain on a long-term 
unsustainable path 
After several years of fiscal consolidation, the
 prospects for further
 consolidation are disappointing. 
First, according the Japanese Cabinet Office's own 
estimates, under the most optimistic medium-term 

scenario (with highest productivity growth and 
significant public expenditure reductions), the surplus 
for the general government primary balance will only 
reach 0.2% of GDP by FY
2011. In this case, the 
central government would sti
ll show a primary deficit 
of 1.2% of GDP in that year. Under the other 
scenarios, the general government primary balance 
remains in deficit in FY2011.  
A more ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation 
programme should be envisaged. Stabilising the debt-
to-GDP ratio will require the achievement of a 
significant primary surplus. While the reduction in 
expenditure should continue, a significant increase in 
fiscal revenues (beyond that stemming from faster 

economic growth) seems necessary. Increasing fiscal 
revenues will be all the more urgent given that the 
central government™s contribution to the basic pension 

programme will increase in 2009 from one third to 
one half of the costs. This is expected to cost an 
additional 1% of GDP per year. The possibility of 

increasing taxes will be discussed after the July 
elections but higher-than-exp
ected fiscal revenues in 
FY2006 might make this harder.

Graph 5.3: 
China - GDP growth
Economic growth remained very strong in 2006.  
After a (revised) growth rate of 10.4% in 2005, GDP 
growth accelerated to 10.7
% y-o-y in 2006. The key 
factors behind this higher-than-expected growth were 

net merchandise exports and a reacceleration of 
investment in fixed assets (accounting actually for 
almost 50% of overall GDP). Driven by rising per 

capita disposable income, private consumption growth 
accelerated slightly to 13.7
% yoy. While there seems 
to have been a slight growth deceleration in the 

second half of 2006 (average annual growth rate of 
10.5%), in the first quarter 
of 2007 growth accelerated 
again to a rate of 11.1% yoy. 
Restricted investment rules and tightened 
monetary policy– 
As the investment rate has continued to be very high, 
especially in the constructio
n and real estate sectors, 
the Chinese authorities have since April 2006  

introduced tightening 
measures, including 
'administrative guidance'.  These measures also 
include attempts to tighten domestic liquidity, which 
continues to be driven up by the massive increase in 
the current account surplus. The authorities have 

reacted not only through 
moral suasion on banks to 
strictly control credit flows to the overly invested 
sectors, but also by four 
increases in the benchmark 
lending rate and five increases in the reserve 
requirement ratio as of end March 2007. 
–only had a temporary impact 
The growth rate of investment and industrial 
production, however, which had somewhat slowed in 
the second half of 2006, responding to the policy 
actions to curb investment
, have reaccelerated again 
in the beginning of the current year. The same is true 

for money supply growth figures which are still 
growing above targets. Given the so far modest 
impact of the previous measures, further tightening 

measures are projected. 
Inflation accelerating– Inflation, which had been benign in the three first 
quarters of 2006 (average CIP rise by 1.3% yoy) 
started accelerating in the fo
urth quarter, brining the 
2006 average to 1.5%.  Due primarily to rising food 
prices, the CPI accelerated to
 2.7% yoy in February 
and 3.3% in March. As consumer prices are not 

expected to accelerate further 
in the course of 2007,  
the average rise in CPI is 
forecast to reach 2.7%. With 
the renminbi (RMB) expected
 to appreciate further, 
the rate of inflation in 2
008 is projected to accelerate 
only slightly compared to the 2007 rate, in spite of on 
going double-digit growth, higher property prices, 

further hikes in administered energy and public utility 
prices, and higher raw mate
rial and production costs. 
–against the background of skyrocketing trade 
and current account surpluses 
After reaching a record surplus of slightly more than 
$100 bn. (6% of GDP) in 2005, implying an 
unprecedented current account
 surplus of 7.2% of 
GDP, China's trade surplus continued to rise in 2006. 
According to Chinese statistics, imports in 2006 rose 
by 23.8% compared to the 
previous year and exports 
jumped by 27.2%, resulting in another jump in the 
trade balance by around 75% to $177.5 bn., bringing 
the current account surplus to more than $200 bn. last 

year. Not surprisingly under these conditions, foreign 
exchange reserves reached $ 
1066.3 bn. at the end of 
2006, an increase by $247.3
 bn. compared to the end 
of 2005; as of end-March 2007, foreign exchange 
reserves had even risen to $1202 billion. 
Outlook for 2007 and 2008 
China's growth is expected 
to ease slightly to 10.5% 
in 2007 and 10.4% in 2008, reflecting earlier policy 
measures to rein in investment growth as well as 
likely further tightening moves. Given, however, that 

exports in the first three months of 2007 were up by 
an average 28% on the same period of last year, the 
overall export growth rate is projected to remain high

 at close to 20%, implying so
me deceleration in export 
figures in the further course of the year; net exports 
would remain an important source for growth. 
This is a considerable upward revision for the 2007 
growth rate compared with 
the autumn 2006 forecast  
due to the stronger-than-expected outcome in 2006 
and the growth data for the first quarter of 2007 which 

show a reaccelera
tion of growth. 
The above mentioned trade figures for the first three 
months of the current year al
so make it likely, that the 
2007 trade surplus will rise to more than $ 250 billion, 

bringing the current account surplus within the 
vicinity of $ 300 billion. With global trade growth 
projected to remain strong in 2008, too, both trade and 

current account surp
lus are likely to r
each more than $ 
300 billion next year.  
  The balance of risks is more
 on the upside, at least 
in the short term  
As the recent tightening steps seem to have had only a 
very limited impact so far, there is a considerable risk 

that growth in the short-term will even be higher than 
assumed by this forecast. This risk is also underlined 
by available figures on excessive liquidity of the 

banking system following ongoing foreign exchange 
accumulations. Also, the growing importance of 
retained cash flows against the background of 

strongly surging profits and the problems the central 
government faces in controlling the regional and local 
levels of government cast doubts on the efficacy of 

the enacted administrativ
e measures to curb 
investment. Growth could therefore even be higher 
than forecast in the s
hort term, but with the 
accompanying risk of a hard
er landing rising in the 
medium-term.

Note on concepts and sources 
  1. The directorate general for ec
onomic and financial affairs (DG 
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-
fledged economic forecasts twice a 
year: in the spring and in the 
autumn. These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic 
aggregates for the Member States, the Candidate Countries, the 
European Union as a whole, the 
euro area and the international 
environment. Interim forecasts, 
updating the outlook for the seven 
largest Member States, EU27 and th
e euro area, are presented in 
between the fully-fledged forecasts.  
2. Data for 2006 are estimates, while those for 2007 and 2008 are 
forecasts, except in the 
case of Greece where also the data for 2006 
are forecasts since Eurostat is currently verifying the revised GDP 

data provided by the national authorities. The sources for all tables 
are the Commission services, excep
t where it is otherwise stated. 
Historical data for the Member States are based on the European 

System of Accounting (ESA 1995). 
Most Member States have now 
introduced chain-linking in their national accounts to measures the 
development of economic aggregates in volume terms. For the USA 

and Japan, the definitions are as in the SNA.  
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic de
mand and final demand respectively, 
present data including inventories. 
4. In Table 16, the data are base
d on the national index for USA and 
Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 1996. 
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential 
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in 

the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment 
and the NAWRU play a key role.  
6. Employment data are based on numbers of persons employed in 
tables 21-27 and 31-32. For Germany, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, 
Hungary, the Netherlands and Austria full-time equivalents are 
available and used, while data for the remaining Member States as 

well as for the EU- and euro area
 aggregates refer to the total 
numbers of persons employed.  
7. The nominal short term interest rates are defined as the 3-month 
inter-bank rates. The nominal long te
rm interest rates are defined as 
the yield on the central government benchmark 10-year bond. 
8. EU27 and euro-area data are a
ggregated using exchange rates. 
World GDP is aggregated using 
Purchasing Power Standards (PPS). 
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the 
aggregation is carried out on the ba
sis of current exchange rates.  
Tables 48-52, 60 and 61 show also
 EU27 and euro-area "adjusted" 
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU27 and euro area vis-à-vis 
third countries should be identical 
to the sum of the balances of the 
individual countries in the EU27 or the euro area. However, intra-
EU27 or intra-euro-area balances
 are non-zero because of reporting 
errors.  
  The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border controls 
and formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of intra-EU 
trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU imports are underestimated 

compared to intra-EU exports, lead
ing to an overestimation of the 
surplus. For the past the "adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates 
for EU27 and ECB estimates for the 
euro area. For the future, they 
are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of the 
discrepancies observed in 2005. 
9. The allocation of mobile phone licences (UMTS) impacts strongly 
on the general government account
s for some countries in 2000-
2007. Tables 35, 37 and 39 include the amounts from the sale of the 
licences, while the cyclic
ally adjusted balances in tables 40 and 41 
exclude these amounts. The amounts in bn of national currency are 
for BE 0.5, for CZ 7.4, for DK 3.2, for DE 50.8, for EE 0.2, for IE 
0.2, for EL 0.7, for ES 0.5, for FR 1.8, for IT 13.8, for HU 52.0, for 

NL 2.7, for AT 0.8, for PL 8.2, for PT 0.4, for SI 0.1, for SK 3.0, for 
UK 22.5, for EU27 110.5, and for the euro area 72.3. 
10. With respect to the 12 RAMS (re
cently-acceded Member States), 
which are currently in a transiti
on phase, the quality of statistical data may not always be directly 
comparable to most EU15 Member 
States. 11. Geographical zones are defined as follows:
