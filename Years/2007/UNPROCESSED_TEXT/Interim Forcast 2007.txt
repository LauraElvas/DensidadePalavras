-GENERAL FOR ECONOMIC AND 
FINANCIAL AFFAIRS              
                                February 2007 Interim forecast  Press conference of 16 February 2007 
Interim forecast, February 2007 
   Continued brisk growth, while inflation is currently easing 
 
 In February 2006, the Commission presented the first 
of what are now regular twice-yearly interim 
forecasts. They update th
e comprehensive bi-annual 
forecasts, the purpose being to improve economic 
surveillance in the European Union and the euro 
area.  Interim forecasts assess real GDP growth and 

HICP inflation for both areas based on updates for 
the seven largest Member States. This note presents 
the third interim forecast and includes, for the first 

time, an update of the Dutch outlook (see also the 
technical Box). It updates the Commission's fully-
fledged autumn forecast of 6 November 2006. 
The European economies performed better than 
expected in 2006 despite headwinds from high 
oil prices, tighter monetary conditions and a 
slowdown of the US economy. Following a 

deceleration in the third quarter of 2006, real 

GDP growth rebounded to 0.9% quarter-on-

quarter (QoQ) in the fourth quarter in both the 

euro area and the EU. For the year as a whole, 
economic activity expanded by 2.7% in the euro 
area and 2.9% in the EU.  
This is slightly above the projections of the 
autumn forecast. In addition to a milder-than-

expected downturn in the US, this robust 

performance reflects an increase in the 

resilience of the European economies, with a 
significant improvement in the labour market 
helping to bolster domestic demand.  
Although moderating somewhat, output growth 
is projected to remain robust in 2007, at 2.4% in 

the euro area and 2.7% in the EU (+0.3 pp. 

compared to the autumn forecast), reflecting a 
marginally higher carry-over from 2006. 
Higher energy prices kept consumer price 
inflation above 2% in 2006 (2.2% in both the 
euro area and the EU). But core inflation, 
excluding energy and unprocessed food, 

remained subdued, suggesting limited indirect 

effects of higher energy prices. Reflecting lower 

oil prices and a moderate initial impact of the 
German VAT hike, the projections for HICP 
inflation in 2007 have been revised downwards, 
to 1.8% in the euro area and 2.0% in the EU. 
Global economic and financ
ial environment remains 
growth-supportive 
Global economy activity has moderated somewhat 
since mid-2006, although remaining overall at a very 

high level. The deceleration is mainly observed in the 
industrial sector, while the solid momentum in the 
services sector continues unabated. Regionally, the 

slowdown has been concentrated in the US and Japan, 
whereas growth in other regions remained vigorous, 
notably in the emerging markets of Asia, many of 

which posted higher growth rates than expected.  
Despite a rebound of consumer spending in the last 
quarter of 2006 in the US Œ fuelled by lower oil prices 

and rapid employment growth Œ indicators point to 
softer growth continuing th
rough the early parts of the 
current year. This follows from an ongoing inventory 

correction in both manufacturing and construction 
that is dampening production. However, as the sharp 
downturn in the housing sector in the US has not 

spread to other parts of the economy so far, the 
probability of a hard landing seems to have 
diminished.  
In Japan, GDP growth slowed down in the course of 
2006, particularly in the th
ird quarter and for private 
consumption. Economic activity is however expected 
to rebound, and growth is
 forecast to lie around 
potential in 2007.  
The somewhat stronger-than-expected performance of 
the US economy in recent 
months combined with 
some upward adjustment of growth rates for emerging 

Asia, particularly China, leads to a more positive 
assessment of the global
 economic environment. 
Compared to the autumn fo
recast, world GDP growth 
(excluding the EU-25) has been revised upwards by 
0.2 percentage point (pp.) for both 2006 and 2007 (to 

6% and 5½%, respectively).   
Thanks to brisk output growth, world trade will keep 
expanding at a rapid pace. However, in view of the 
easing in the global manufac
turing sector, trade in 
goods is expected to grow at a slightly lower rate than 
assumed in the autumn forecast. Total world imports 
of goods excluding the EU ar
e thus projected to reach 
9.2% in 2006 and 8.4% in 2007, 0.2 pp. below the 
autumn forecast.  
On the back of an initially mild winter, oil prices 
eased significantly in th
e early weeks of 2007. 
Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 Thereafter, prices have rise
n again, reflecting harsher 
winter weather in parts of the Northern hemisphere 
and the decision of the US authorities to double the 

size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves. They 
remain, however, below the level observed at the time 
of the autumn forecast and,
 based on futures prices, 
the average price for Brent cr
ude in 2007 is estimated 
at 59.9 USD per barrel, some 6½ USD below the 
assumption in the autumn.  
The euro has appreciated in
 recent months and, for 
example, now stands at 1.30 vis-à-vis the USD 
(compared to 1.27 USD/EUR for 2007 assumed in the 
autumn 2006 for
ecast). However, the appreciation of 
the nominal effective exchange rate is much more 
limited.  
Financing conditions have remained favourable in the 
EU as suggested by several indicators. In particular, 
credit growth continues to rise at a brisk pace. Despite 
policy interest rates having moved up since the 

autumn, the cost of external financing has remained 
broadly stable as (already low) corporate bond 
spreads have narrowed further and a rise in stock 

prices has lowered the cost of equity financing. 
Although policy interest rates are assumed, following 
market expectations, to rise further in the near term 

(see Box), financing conditions are expected to 
remain broadly benign. 
Growth was well above potential throughout 2006  
The very strong growth recorded in the euro-area and 
EU economies in the first half of 2006 moderated 

somewhat, although remaining well above potential in 
the second half of the year. Real GDP rose by 0.9% 
quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in 
both the euro area and the 
EU in the fourth 
quarter according to Eurostat. This 
outcome is better than expected in the autumn 

forecast, suggesting an up
ward revision of annual 
GDP growth to 2.7% in the euro area and 2.9% in the 
EU (up from 2.6% and 2.8% respectively).  
The economic pick-up apparently became more 
broad-based in the course of 2006 (although the 
break-down of GDP into its components is not yet 
available for the fourth quarter). Domestic demand 

remained the main contributor to growth, but net trade 
improved after the relatively weak performance in 
2005 (Graph 1). However, despite a robust growth of 

exports, an even stronger growth of imports limited 
the contribution of net exports. The recovery of 
domestic demand (excluding inventories) was initially 
driven by a surge in investment spending. Although 
private consumption increased more moderately, its 

contribution to real GDP growth was equal to that of 
investment for the first three quarters of 2006. The 
strengthening of private consumption in the euro area 

owes much to the improved performance on the 
labour market, with employment growth picking up to 
0.4% QoQ on average since late 2005.

 Furthermore, growth differentials among the largest 
economies narrowed toward
s the end of 2006. They 
amounted to more than 1 pp. in the first half of 2005, 
but declined to ½ pp. in the fourth quarter of 2006. 

Three out of the five larges
t euro-area economies even 
recorded a growth rate between 0.9 and 1.1% QoQ in 
the fourth quarter of 2006.  
Survey indicators point to continued robust growth 
Looking ahead, survey data indicate continued 
vigorous real GDP growth in the coming quarters, 
although at a somewhat lo
wer pace than the record 
highs attained in 2006.  
The European Commission's economic confidence 
indicators still appear to
 be on an upward trend 
(Graph 2). Despite a certain weakening in January, all 

sectoral confidence indicator
s remain well above their 
long-term averages in both 
the euro area and the EU.  
Although the Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMI) for 
manufacturing and services p
eaked already during the 
summer of 2006, they remain firmly in the zone 
Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 indicating expansion. Moreover, a certain rebound has 
been observed for PMI serv
ices in the most recent 
months. In addition, the surge of the employment 

component of the PMI manufacturing to the highest 
level since November 2000 suggests that 
manufacturing companies also remain optimistic 

about their outlook.

Industrial confidence
 Several national survey indicators have declined 
somewhat in early 2007, but remain well above their 

historical averages, sugg
esting GDP growth above 
potential (such as the German IFO and Belgian NBB 
indexes). 
A certain divergence in the 
outlook at the sectoral 
level is not necessarily surprising. The recent rebound 
noted in the PMI services is likely to reflect the 
increased importance of domestic demand in the EU. 
The decline recorded in 
PMI manufacturing in the 
EU, on the other hand, mirrors a moderation in the 

industrial sector globally, which is likely to be more 
noticeable for some Member 
States in view of their 
competitive position.  
The slight moderation in economic growth suggested 
by some survey data may reflect the impact of the 
strengthened euro together 
with a deceleration of the 
industrial cycle. It could 
also be caused by a lagged 
effect of high oil prices in 2006, which may gradually 
weigh on the growth momentum. In the case of 
Germany, it also mirrors the expected impact on 

demand in the first half of 2007 of the increase in the 
standard VAT rate by 3 percentage points in January 
2007. However, the still relatively favourable 
assessment of the current situation in the IFO index 
suggests that the impact may be less pronounced than 

expected in the autumn fore
cast and partly offset by 
the effect of a stronger-tha
n-expected labour market 
on consumer spending.
 2007: another year with growth above potential 
Based on the individual updates for Germany, Spain, 
France, Italy, the Netherla
nds, Poland and the United 
Kingdom (which are presente
d in greater detail in the 
country-specific sections be
low), GDP growth is set 
to temporarily slow in the first quarter of 2007, 
mainly reflecting developments in Germany, before 

rebounding to around 0.6% QoQ for the rest of the 
year. This is broadly in line with the outcome of DG 
ECFIN's Dynamic Factor Model which projects euro-

area GDP growth of 0.6% QoQ on average in 2007.  
As a consequence of a stronger carry-over from 2006 
coupled with a slightly highe
r growth profile in 2007, 
GDP growth is revised upwards for the year as a 

whole by 0.3 pp. in both ar
eas as compared to the 
autumn forecast, to 2.4% 
for the euro area and 2.7% 
for the EU. 
Domestic demand is expected to continue to be the 
main contributor to GDP growth in both the euro area 
and the EU, with output set to be driven by private 
consumption and investment.  
Private consumption will be supported by an 
improved outlook for real disposable income, 
reflecting the better-than-expected inflation outlook 
and favourable labour market developments. 
Moreover, consumer confidence remains on an 
upward trend since mid-2005 and is above its long-

term average since the beginning of 2006.  
Judging from the European Commission's investment 
survey of October-November 2006, investment 
volumes in the manufacturing sector are expected to 

rise at their fastest pace 
since 2001 Œ albeit with 
sizeable differences noted across the largest Member 
States. The pick-up in investment intentions may 

mirror the further increas
e recorded in capacity 
utilisation - which rose above its long-term average to 
more than 84% in both th
e euro area and the EU in 
January - continued favourable financing conditions 
and generally optimistic demand expectations.  
 Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 Inflation remained contained in 2006 despite high 
oil prices 
Consumer price inflation was 2.2% in 2006 in both 
the euro area and the EU, 
broadly in line with the 
autumn forecast for 2006 and unchanged from the 
previous year. The hike in energy prices kept headline 
HICP inflation above 2% until August. Thereafter, the 

drop in oil and energy prices helped to bring inflation 
down below 2%. In contrast, core inflation (HICP 
excluding energy and unprocessed food prices) 

remained fairly steady at 
1.5% on average in 2006, 
suggesting the absence of 
 second-round effects from 
the energy price hikes. This is highly significant as it 
took place in a situation of
 cyclical acceleration and 
strong labour demand. Overall, it was developments 

in energy prices that sh
aped the pattern of HICP 
inflation during 2006.

  In 2006, some upward price pressures were 
compensated for by favourable cost developments in 
the labour market. In particular, industrial price 
pressures at the producer level crept up in the first 

half of 2006, and decelerated
 in the second half, while 
remaining relatively high (rising by 5.1% on average). 
Moreover, money and credit growth kept rising at a 

swift pace (around 9% YoY 
in the last quarter of 
2006), the fastest pace sinc
e the introduction of the 
euro in 1999. On the other hand, strong international 

price competition limited the full pass-through of 
relatively high input prices to core and headline 
inflation. Wage developments remained subdued, 
with total hourly labour costs rising at an annual rate 
of 2% in the third quarter of 2006 (down from 2.3% 
in the first half of 2006). Compensation per employee 

increased only moderately, at an annual rate of 2.3% 
up to the third quarter of 2006.  
Inflation to ease in 2007, with upside risks 
Looking ahead, the outlook for inflation in 2007 has 
been revised downwards, based on the individual 

updates for Germany, France
, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. HICP 
inflation is now expected to
 average 1.8% in the euro 
area and 2.0% in the EU this
 year. This is a downward 
revision of 0.3 pp. for bo
th areas compared to the 
autumn 2006 forecast.   
The expected easing of o
il prices and the rather 
moderate impact of the German VAT hike play a key 
role in making the inflation outlook more optimistic 

in the short term. Indeed, the VAT effect might be 
more spread out than initially expected in autumn 
2006. The quarterly pattern projected for 2007 will be 

affected by base effects re
ducing inflation in the first 
two quarters and increasing 
it towards the end of the 
year. On top of this, the increase in productivity 

witnessed in 2006 has resulted in low unit labour cost 
growth. Should growth prospects materialise as 
foreseen in 2007, this dampening effect should 

continue to keep a lid on price pressures from the 
input side. However, as the cycle matures and 
productivity growth goes beyond its peak, unit labour 

costs may start to pick up again in the course of 2007. 
The improvement noted in the labour market could 
eventually prompt higher wage settlements. 
Improved outlook for the labour market and public 
finances In 2006, the labour market has improved 
considerably. For the euro 
area, after four years of 
subdued growth at around 0.7% per year, employment 
growth accelerated to ar
ound 1.5% in 2006, 
representing around 2 million new jobs (3 million in 

the EU). Meanwhile, the euro-area unemployment 
rate reached 7.5% in December 2006 (an annual 
average of 7.8%), the lowest level in more than a 

decade. While the fall in the unemployment rate is 
attributable to a large extent to the strong cyclical 
upswing, available estimates al
so point to a clear fall 
in the structural rate of
 unemployment, currently 
estimated at around 7.8%, indicating that earlier 
Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 labour market reforms have had some effect. The 
chances are then, that the 
improvement is not just 
quantitative but also qualitative, e.g. by creating more 

jobs in the regular labour market.  
In line with the revisions made to the growth and 
inflation projections for 2007, the labour markets are 
expected to continue to improve, somewhat more 

strongly than suggested in the autumn forecast.  
The information available suggests that the outlook 
for public finances is al
so brighter. The budgetary 
results in several Member States, in particular in 
Germany, proved better than forecast in 2006. This 
better-than-expected development should, to some 

extent, be carried over to 2007. Higher growth should 
support public finance adjustment also this year.  
Risks to the forecast remain fairly balanced 
The autumn forecast identifie
d the risks to the outlook 
as being tilted to the upside for 2006, but skewed to 

the downside further ahead. Developments since then 
have confirmed a number of upside risks for 2006 
(higher growth in emerging Asia, lower oil prices, 

higher employment and productivity growth in the 
EU), with important knock-on effects for 2007. The 
downside risks have not materialised to the same 

extent. The single most important downside risk at the 
time, i.e. the possibility of a hard landing for the US 
economy, has clearly diminish
ed since the publication 
of the autumn forecast.  
This does not mean that 
there area no longer any 
downside risks at all. Indeed, while there is a higher 
likelihood of a soft landing of the US economy, the 
issue of global imbalances remains unsolved. Whilst 
the probability of a disorderly unwinding of these 

imbalances remains low, if it did happen it would 
have far-reaching conseque
nces. Similarly, the yen 
seems to trade significantly below its longer-term 

equilibrium. This tends to erode the competitiveness 
of euro-area exports and ca
rries the risk of abrupt 
exchange rate adjustments 
in the event of a rapid 
unwinding of carry-trade positions. Finally, oil prices 
may remain volatile during 2007, amid continued 
risks of geopolitical tensions. 
The EU economy proved remarkably resilient in 2006 
in the face of headwinds from higher oil prices, a 
tighter monetary policy stan
ce, an appreciating euro 
and the slowdown of the US
 economy. The fact that 
growth was driven by a marked pick-up of domestic 
demand bodes well for the outlook in 2007. In 
particular, the turnaround in the labour market will 

boost labour incomes and consumer confidence, and 
could turn this upswing into a durable, domestically-
led recovery. However, a precondition for this to 

materialise is that price and wage pressures remain 
contained. While the recen
t rebound in productivity 
growth provides some leeway in a number of 

countries, an unwarranted acceleration of wages could 
choke off the expansion by prompting a faster-than-
expected monetary policy tightening.  
Overall, the risks to this
 forecast appear broadly 
balanced. Uncertainties remain high regarding the 
impact of the VAT increase in Germany, as the better-

than-expected growth in 
the second half of 2006 
could also imply a correspond
ingly larger payback in 
the first half of 2007. On the other hand, the strong 

performance of the German
 economy in 2006 could 
also mean that growth in Germany is being lifted onto 
a higher longer-term trajector
y, following an extended 
period of adjustment and structural reforms. 
Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 Growth and inflation prospects in the seven largest 
Member States 
1. Germany - the economy continues its buoyant 
recovery On 13 February 2007, the 
German statistical office 
(Destatis) announced that real GDP had grown by 
0.9% QoQ in the fourth quarter of 2006. It also 
revised growth in the preceding three quarters 

upwards. As a consequence, real annual GDP grew by 
2.7% in 2006, which is 0.3 pp. above the Commission 
services autumn forecast. At the same time, the 
growth carry-over to 2007 amounts to 1.3 pps., 0.3 
pp. higher than in the autumn projection.  
The revised growth figures suggest that, on the back 
of booming exports, a solid increase in capital 
formation (both equipment and construction) and a 
better functioning labour market, the underlying 

expansion in economic activity has been more robust 
than was expected in au
tumn. Private consumption 
contributed to growth in 2006, after several years of 

stagnation. This was partly driven by substantial 
anticipation effects ahead 
of the VAT increase on 
January, 1
st. While the corresponding mirror-effect is 
expected to weigh on private consumption 
expenditure in 2007, the underlying recovery in 
private consumption is corroborated by a further 

brightening of the labour market. In addition, the 
swing effects in domestic demand related to fiscal 
measures may have been muted, as the pass-through 

of the VAT hike to consumer prices is apparently 
spread over several months.  
Furthermore, recent indicators suggest that, after a 
growth dip in 2007-Q1, the German economy will 
resume its cyclical upswing. Consumer confidence is 
benefiting from a more favourable labour market 

outlook and business expectations have been steadily 
increasing since October. 
Real GDP is therefore 
expected to grow by 1.8% this year, which is 0.6 pp. 

higher than projected in autumn. 
With an average annual rate of 1.8%, HICP inflation 
in 2006 turned out as predicted in the autumn 
forecast. The VAT increase from 1 January 2007 

caused prices to rise at the beginning of this year, 
albeit by much less than implied by a full pass-
through to consumer prices. Although further VAT-

induced price increases ca
nnot be excluded for the 
remainder of the year, lo
wer energy prices will 
dampen HICP inflation to 1.7% in 2007, which is 0.5 
pp. below the autumn forecast.

  2. Spain - higher growth, lower inflation 
In 2006, the Spanish economy™s long upswing 
continued and, in fact, ga
thered pace. GDP growth, 
according to the most recen
t estimates, may have 
risen to 3.8% in 2006, from 3.5% the previous year. 
GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 attained 

1.1% QoQ (0.9% in the previous quarter). Strong 
economic activity continue
d to be underpinned 
exclusively by domestic demand, mainly by the high 

dynamism of private consumption and investment in 
dwellings, which was partially offset by the draining 
effect of a negative net external demand. However, 

the growth composition was more balanced than in 
2005. This might be partly the result of tightening of 
monetary conditions, having been one of the main 

drivers behind the strong and sustained domestic 
demand growth during the last decade. 
In 2007, GDP growth is projected to slow down 
marginally to 3.7%. Bo
th annual average and 
quarterly profiles reflect 
developments in the euro- 
area economy, namely a downturn in the first quarter 
followed by an upswing in the second. However, 
activity expansion will still be based on domestic 
demand. In spite of prospects of a certain rebalancing 

of the growth pattern, a still negative contribution of 
net exports to growth should keep on feeding an 
Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 increasing current account deficit, which might attain 
9½% of GDP at the end of the year.  
Inflation reached an annual 
average rate of 3.6% in 
2006, 0.2 pp. higher than in 2005. However, price 

pressures eased to 2.6% YoY in the last quarter of 
2006, driven by lower-than-projected oil prices, and 
should continue to moderate to 2.5% in 2007. In 

2006, the inflation differen
tial with the euro area 
peaked at 1½ pps. for the year as a whole, but it 
should decline to about ¾ of one pp. in 2007. Apart 

from the effect associated
 with energy prices, the 
sharp decline in Spanish inflation may also be due to 
moderate wage developments. Specifically, 
indexation clauses (associated with labour market 
agreements) are based on year-on-year inflation at the 

end of the year, which was relatively low.

  3. France Œ growth to pick up 
The French economy lost momentum in the second 
half of 2006, when GDP stagnated in the third quarter. 

Nevertheless, for the year as a whole, GDP growth is 
estimated to have reached 1.9% in 2006, after 1.2% in 
2005. This is 0.3 pp. below the projections in the 
Commission services' autumn
 forecasts. The main 
factor behind this downward revision is the 

unexpected decrease in exports in the third quarter, 
which has highlighted the weaknesses of the French 
external sector. In
 2006, net trade once again made a 
negative contribution to GDP growth of around 0.5 
pp. Preliminary data for the last quarter (GDP growth 
of 0.6%-0.7% QoQ) and the last macroeconomic 
indicators suggest that GDP growth should remain 

robust in the coming months. 
In 2007, economy activity is
 projected to increase by 
2.2%. GDP growth is expected to be still largely 
driven by domestic demand and especially by private 

consumption. Consumption is likely to increase in 
line with households' disposable income. Employment 
growth has shown encouraging signs and the benign 

inflation outlook should also support households' 
purchasing power. Thanks to improved prospects in 
France's main trading partners, exports could 
somewhat rebound in the course of 2007. 
Nevertheless, the external sector should again dampen 

GDP growth, as imports are 
projected to grow in line 
with robust domestic demand, outpacing the growth 
in exports.

 Inflation in 2006 turned out at 1.9%, in line with the 
autumn forecast. In view of
 the expected decrease in 
oil prices in the course of 2007, headline HICP 
inflation should be close to 1.5% this year, lower than 

expected last autumn. Second-round effects from high 
prices of raw materials have been contained up to 
now. Unit labour costs ar
e forecast to gradually 
increase since the cyclical rise in labour productivity 
should wane. Thus, core inflation, as measured by 
HICP excluding food and energy prices, should be 
close to 1¾%. 
 Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 4. Italy - a good start for economic growth in 2007 
Italy ended 2006 on a strong note. Quarterly GDP is 
reported to have accelerated to 1.1% in the fourth 
quarter of 2006. The resulting annual growth rate for 

real GDP in 2006 is estim
ated at 1.9%, the highest 
since 2000 and 0.2 pp. higher than projected in the 
autumn forecast.   
The acceleration of GDP growth
 in the latter part of 
the year was foreshadowed 
by a surge in industrial 
production in the last quarter of the year, and 
especially in December (+2%
 relative to the previous 
month). Italian manufacturers seem to have benefited 
from increased external demand, which within the EU 

was particularly driven by German orders. At the 
same time, the component breakdown of industrial 
production, as well as still positive indications for the 

services sector, suggest that private consumption and 
gross fixed capital formation are continuing to 
contribute positively to growth.

 The acceleration in the fourth
 quarter of 2006 also 
implies a favourable impact on real GDP growth in 

2007: the carryover effect into
 2007 is now at +1.2%, 
well above the +0.6% exp
ected in the autumn. 
However, the decrease in industrial and consumer 

confidence recorded in January, as well as the 
expected contraction of German growth in the first 
quarter of the year, suggest
 that economic activity in 
Italy will slow down in the first part of the year. In 
2007 as a whole, economic gr
owth is expected to be 
2% (1.9% if adjusted for the 3 additional working 
days), 0.6 pp. higher than in the autumn forecast. 
Annual HICP inflation in 2006, at 2.2%, turned out 
slightly lower than projected
 in the autumn forecast, 
partly thanks to the falling energy prices in the last 
part of the year. The forecast for annual HICP 
inflation in 2007 has also been revised marginally 

downwards relative to the au
tumn forecast, from 2.0% 
to 1.9%. Besides lower energy prices, the 
liberalisation measures adopted or planned so far 

should contribute to a deceleration in prices. 
 5. The Netherlands Œ recovery continues 
Real GDP growth continued to be quite vigorous in 
the fourth quarter of 2006, posting a 0.6% QoQ 

growth and thereby contributing to annual growth of 
2.9%. International trade flows, in particular, 
continued to be buoyant in the fourth quarter, while 

domestic demand components eased slightly. 
Employment growth firmed in
 the course of the year 
and reached 1.7% measured in full-time equivalents. 

For 2007, employment growth is likely to remain 
strong and domestic sources of growth, including 
private consumption expenditure, are expected to 

once again contribute significantly to GDP growth.

 In the course of 2006, both consumer and business 
confidence indicators im
proved strongly. The 
production expectations in the industry seem to have 
Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 stabilised at a high level, supporting an outlook of 
steady underlying growth well into 2007. In all, real 
GDP growth is likely to remain strong throughout 

2007 and post quarterly growth rates of 0.6%. On an 
annual basis, this will result in GDP growth of 2.8%. 
The labour market is expected to tighten further in the 
course of 2007 and with the unemployment rate 

falling to around 3% it will show its first signs of 
overheating in the form of labour shortages in some 
sectors including construction and business services. 

At the start of 2007, ev
idence is mounting that 
contractual wages are accelerating and this should 
lead to upward price pres
sures over the course of 
2007. However, this effect 
is expected to be fully 
compensated by the impact of
 the recent decline in oil 
prices. All in all, HICP inflation is expected remain 
modest in 2007 and come out at 1.7%. 
 6. Poland Œ the economy surprises on the positive 
side Economic activity continued to be strong at the end of 
2006. GDP growth is estimated to have surged to 
2.6% QoQ in the last quarter of 2006. This is a 
preliminary estimate subject to revision. Very strong 

growth in the fourth quarter contributed to an annual 
growth rate of 5.8%, 0.6 pp. higher than in the autumn 
forecast. The positive growth surprise was due to 

continued strong investments in construction activity 
in particular, thanks to the mild winter. 
For 2007, GDP is expected to grow by 6%, which is 
1¼ pps. higher than in th
e autumn forecast. This 
follows from the much better-than-expected result in 
the second half of 2006 and a positive outlook for 

2007 as indicated by hard and soft indicators.  
GDP is expected to grow 
at around 1¼% QoQ in the 
first half of 2007 and to decelerate slightly to 1% in 
the second half of the year. Domestic demand will 

continue to be the main driver of growth, with a key 
role for robust gross fixed capital formation and 
strong consumption. Lower external demand due to a 

slower world GDP growth and rising investment- and 
consumption-driven imports will slow down the 
growth rate of the Polish economy in the second half 

of the year. Consumption growth is being supported 
by a recovery in the labour market. In 2006, the 
employment rate increased by ca. 1.8 pps., while the 
unemployment rate was reduced by 3 pps. to 14.9% at 
the end of the year, which 
means 550 thousand people 
found a job. The improvement is expected to 

continue, albeit at a slower
 pace due to emerging skill 
mismatches.

 HICP inflation reached 1.3% year-on-year in 2006, 
slightly lower than in th
e autumn forecast. Planned 
excise duty hikes and higher wage demands, fuelled 
partly by labour shortages in certain segments of the 

market, will put upward pressure on inflation in 2007, 
but a stronger zloty, falling import prices and lower 
fuel prices will mitigate the impact. Thus, inflation for 

2007 has been revised do
wnwards compared to the 
autumn forecast, from 2.5% to 2.0%. 
 7. The United Kingdom - firm growth continues 
Estimated GDP growth of 0.8% QoQ in the fourth 
quarter of 2006 confirms that the UK economy 

continues to expand at a robust pace. 
During the first three quarters of 2006 GDP growth 
was mainly driven by domestic demand. Consumption 
grew steadily, although below its historical average, 

and business investment maintained a sound footing. 
Trade volumes showed a buoyant evolution during the 
first half of the year, decreasing afterwards. However, 

except in the second quarte
r of 2006, the external 
sector recorded a nega
tive net contribution to 
economic growth. 
Interim forecast, February 2007 
    
 In the fourth quarter of 2006, services proved to be 
the main contributor to growth while total production 
fell slightly. Although an expenditure breakdown is 

not yet available, retail sales volumes showing a 
strong increase in the quarter suggest firm consumer 
spending. 
January survey indicators confirm that retail trade 
confidence remained 
robust at the st
art of 2007. GDP 
is expected to maintain its steady growth early in the 
year before gradually deceler
ating, mainly due to the 
effects of higher interest 
rates, to reach an annual 
growth rate of 2¾% for the y
ear as a whole. This is a 
slight upward revision from the autumn forecast.

 The year-on-year HICP inflation rate reached 2.7% in 
the fourth quarter of 2006, including a spike to 3.0% 

in December mainly driven 
by a strong increase in 
transport costs. The Bank of England increased its 
policy rate by 25 basis points (bp) in January 2007. 

This rise followed two 25 bp increases in August and 
November 2006. In the 
remainder of the year 
inflationary pressures from en
ergy prices are expected 
to fade away as the fall already evident in wholesale 
prices is reflected with a lag in retail prices. In 
addition, wage growth is as
sumed to remain stable or 
rise only moderately compared to the subdued levels 
in 2006, thus dampening second-round inflationary 
effects. Inflation is thus expected to fall slightly below 

the Bank of England target of 2% by the end of 2007. 
The forecast for average HI
CP inflation in 2007 
remains as in the autumn
 2006 forecast, 2.2%.

 Box: Technical background to the interim forecast 
 In February 2006, the Commission presented the first 
of what are now twice-year
ly interim forecasts with 
the objective of updating its comprehensive spring 

and autumn economic forecas
ts (with the next fully-
fledged forecast scheduled for 7 May 2007). This 
interim forecast updates the outlook of the autumn 

2006 economic forecast of 6 November 
(http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/eu
ropean_economy/forecasts_en.htm
 ). The cut-off date 
for this interim forecast to take new information on 
board was 13 February 2007. 
The interim forecast updates 
the outlook for the seven  
largest Member States (bas
ed on an average of the 
ranking in terms of both population and nominal 
GDP), i.e. France, Germany,
 Italy, the Netherlands, 
Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom, as regards 
real GDP growth and HICP 
inflation for the current 
year. These updates are pr
epared using indicator-
based forecasting models or
 judgemental forecasting 
techniques.  
Estimates for the European Union and the euro area 
are prepared using the nominal GDP-weighted 

updates for the largest Member States. These 
countries account for more than 80% of the European 
Union and almost 85% of the euro area in terms of 

nominal GDP. The outlook for the smaller Member 
States, which have tended to grow faster than the 
larger ones, have not been updated. The Commission 

has made projections for the euro area and the EU 
using the updates for the five and seven largest 
Member States respectively, and assuming that the 
revision for the smaller Member States is equal to that 
of the larger ones. 
Quarterly data are updated with the latest available 
information. When comparing quarterly with annual 
GDP growth it must be kept in mind that, whenever 
possible, quarterly data are adjusted for both seasonal 

influences and the number of working days while 
annual data is presented in unadjusted form. 
External conditions  
This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions. These assumptions are based on market 

expectations at the time of 
the forecast. To shield the 
assumptions from possible volatility during one 
specific trading day, averages from a 10-day reference 
period have been used for exchange and interest rates 
as well as for oil prices.  
The technical assumption as
 regards exchange rates 
has been standardised using fixed nominal exchange 
rates for all currencies. They are kept constant based 
on the averages from 31 January to 13 February.  
Interest rates assumptions are, for the first time, 
market-based instead of expert-based. Short-term 
interest rates for the euro area are derived from future 
contracts. Long-term interest
 rates for the euro area, 
as well as short- and long-term interest rates for 
Poland and the UK are calculated using implicit 

forward swap rates, corrected for the spread between 
the 3-month interbank interest rate and the 3-month 
swap-rate. As a result, both
 the short- and long-term 
interest rates are at 4.1% on average in 2007 for the 
euro area. 
The outlook for oil prices is based on futures prices. 
The price for a barrel of Bren
t crude oil is projected at 
59.9 USD/barrel in 2007. This would be 6.4 
USD/barrel lower than assu
med in the autumn 2006 
forecast, reflecting inter alia the exceptionally mild 

winter.  
Global demand in 2007 is revised slightly upwards, 
mirroring an improved outlook in Asia (excluding 
Japan) and somewhat stronger-than-expected growth 

in the United States in recent months. Real GDP 
growth for the world (excluding the EU-25) is thus 
forecast to ease from 6% in
 2006 to 5½% in 2007. At 
the same time, world trade has been revised 
marginally downwards for 2007, with growth in 

export and import volumes of goods estimated at 9% 
and 8½%, respectively (excluding the EU-25), 
reflecting a certain moderation in the global 

manufacturing sector.
