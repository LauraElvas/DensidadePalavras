After the healthy growth observed in 1998, the EU as a whole and the euro area will slow down significantly this year as a result of the deteriorated international environment, but the slow–down will be
temporary.
Stockbuilding, while having kept activity up in 1998, unwinds in the light of weak export demand
which, together with less investment growth, leads to the sharper than expected growth deceleration
in 1999.
Sound fundamentals and robust domestic demand in the EU, especially private consumption, should
lift the economy to a higher growth path in 2000, when the external environment is expected to improve.
Thanks to the temporary nature of the dip, job creation should only be mildly affected and labour shedding is also likely to be limited allowing the unemployment rate to continue falling, albeit more slowly.
The slowdown is temporary and conditions for sustained economic growth and job creation remain intact.
Moderate commodity prices, in particular the price of oil and favourable domestic conditions are
driving headline inflation to historically low levels. Nominal interest rates are also at record lows.
In 1998, government accounts improved further thanks mainly to stronger economic growth and
lower interest payments. No deterioration is expected in 1999, despite the slowdown in activity.

Overview
In the EU, overall, 1998 turned out well, but since the last
quarter of that year the outlook became clouded due to more
negative indicators. In consequence, the slowdown in 1999
is likely to be more pronounced than expected in last Autumn Forecasts and real GDP growth will be limited to
2.1 %. However, fundamentals remain healthy and the dip
is expected to be only temporary so that an acceleration of
real GDP growth to 2.7 % in 2000 is possible. A similar
picture emerges for the euro area where the average growth
rate is marginally above the EU as a whole in 1999 and at
the same level in 2000. The slowdown is provoked by the
impact of faltering export demand on investment and
stock–building. Private consumption remains largely unscathed under the influence of growing real income and
buoyant consumer confidence which contrasts sharply with
the negative mood in industry.
Some SE Asian countries may be starting to climb out of the
trough, but the devaluation of the Brazilian Real underlined
the fragility of the emerging markets and tipped Latin–
America into recession. In Japan, despite the fiscal stimulus
injected and measures taken to consolidate the banking system, the economy will be facing another, albeit smaller, contraction this year. The Russian crisis is sharper than foreseen
and is having a greater impact on the Central and Eastern
European countries. All this has led to a further deterioration
of the international environment which the good news
coming from the US could not offset. However, the world
economy is expected to recover gradually, so that by 2000 it
will not exert any longer a negative influence on the EU.
At 1.1 % employment creation was particularly strong in
1998 in the EU. The temporary dip in activity in 1999
should have only a mild effect on net employment creation
in the EU, which is expected to be at 0.8 % per year corresponding to about 2.5 million jobs in 1999–2000. Also labour shedding should be limited. Over the same period the
number of unemployed could decrease by 1.1 million to
about 14.5 million in 2000 (9.2 % of the labour force).
There are few threats to price stability and the risk of deflation is further away than the low headline inflation may
suggest. Due to large terms–of–trade movements and the
decline in interest rates, differences between some of the
inflation measures are larger than usual. The deflator of private consumption for the euro area has been revised down
to 1.2 % in 1999 and to 1.5 % in 2000.
The general government deficit (1.5 % of GDP in the EU)
turned out better than expected in 1998, mainly thanks to
stronger growth and lower interest rates. The underlying
budgetary positions, however, did not show significant improvements. Based on the measures in national budgets
presented by the Member States the general government
deficit should remain at 1.5% of GDP in 1999 and should
see a small reduction in 2000 to 1.3 % for the EU as a whole.
International environment
Fears of a new international financial crisis were renewed
after the collapse of the Brazilian Real peg to the dollar in
January. Although some financial instability followed,

mainly in Latin America, the reaction of markets in the rest
of the world was muted and financial turmoil on the scale
seen in August–September 1998 following Russia’s unilateral debt moratorium has not been repeated. Moreover, the
US economy grew more strongly than expected in 1998 and
the forecast for 1999 has been revised upwards as a consequence. There are signs that SE Asia may have passed the
trough, as evidenced by recovering currencies and equity
prices and by an end to the decline in output in some
countries. The Japanese economy is expected to start growing again in the second half of 1999.
Overall world GDP growth is estimated to have turned out
in 1998 broadly as forecast at 2.1%. This rate of growth is
expected to be maintained in 1999 with an acceleration to
2.9% following in 2000. Given the expected slowdown in
the EU economy in 1999, GDP growth in the world excluding the EU is set to accelerate earlier and more rapidly.
Import growth in the world excluding the EU decelerated
very sharply from 10.6% in 1997 to 2.3% in 1998 as demand collapsed in the economies most affected by financial
crisis. A reacceleration over the forecasting period is assumed in line with an expected pick–up in world GDP
growth. Nevertheless, the rise in import growth to 5.3% by
2000 remains well below the growth rates of around 10% or
more recorded between 1993 and 1997. Extra–EU export
market growth is assumed to remain at 3.6% in 1999 before
rising to 5.7% in 2000.
The US economy grew more strongly than expected in 1998
and the forecast for 1999 has been revised upwards as a
consequence. After a buoyant 3.9% in 1998, a soft–landing
is expected with growth slowing to 2.7% this year and 2.2%
next year.
By contrast recession in Japan turned out deeper than expected in 1998 (–2.9%) and negative growth is now expected to persist in 1999 (–1.3%). However the latest data
indicate that the rate of decline is slowing. Positive growth
is expected by the second half of 1999 as the reform of the
banking sector improves confidence and the fiscal stimulus
packages take effect, with an external boost provided by an
expected pick–up in demand from Japan’s major trading
partners in Asia.
The worst of the financial turmoil in SE Asia appears to
have passed and signs of improvement in the real economies of the affected countries are now starting to appear as
well: output has stopped shrinking and foreign trade is starting to recover. Economic growth in Asean 4 + South Korea
fell by 9.2% in 1998 but is expected to turn slightly positive
this year (+0.3%) and pick up further in 2000 (3.0%).
Growth already slowed sharply in Latin America in 1998 to
1.3% as a consequence of the trade and contagion effects of
the financial crises in Asia and Russia. The impact of January’s events in Brazil suggests output will decline further
and move into negative territory this year (–2.2%).
The outlook for the FSU (former Soviet Union) is not encouraging: after finally achieving positive growth of 1.1%
in 1997, a decline of 2.7% is estimated for 1998 and growth
is expected to remain negative throughout the forecasting
period (–4.0% in 1999, –1.4% in 2000). The adverse effects

of developments in the FSU and a slowdown in the EU
mean GDP growth in the EAC (Europe Agreement
countries, see table for definition) is now estimated to have
come in lower in 1998 (2.2%) than forecast in the autumn
but a slight pick–up to 2.4% is forecast for this year, with a
stronger acceleration to 3.1% in 2000.

The loss in demand resulting from the crises in emerging
markets, particularly in Asia, has resulted in a drop in commodity prices. While the effect has been positive for net importers, including the EU, pushing external balances up and
reducing inflationary pressure, the reverse is true for net exporting countries relying heavily on raw material exports.
Although there is some divergence among non–oil commodity prices, overall a decline by roughly 10 % was seenlast year. Since oversupply is expected to continue for several years a further drop in prices is expected in 1999 and

Box 1: Millennium bug
The macroeconomic impact of the Millennium Bug is difficult to assess. Estimates of the spending devoted to fixing the
problem vary widely both in terms of the amounts involved
and the time horizon. There is even more uncertainty concerning the probability and potential costs of disruption resulting from a failure to fix the problem, but most forecasters
agree that effects on output are unlikely to be permanent.
Thus the Millennium Bug problem is not explicitly modelled
in these forecasts.
Expenditure aimed at keeping existing systems in working
order will not directly raise output. Replacing hardware or
software that is too expensive or impossible to fix will require
new investment. These effects are likely to have been spread
over a number of years: some organisations will have made
their preparations well in advance and others later. Scale efficiencies may exist where this work is carried out in conjunction with upgrades for other reasons, for example in preparation for the launch of the euro. But there is nevertheless likely
to be some offset in terms of lower investment in other areas
or at a later date.

There may be a precautionary build–up of inventories in late
1999 by households and business to guard against systems
failures at the turn of the year, but there would be an offsetting
effect in early 2000.
It cannot be excluded that some minor disruption occurs in the
real economy and/or financial system due to technical failures when the year 2000 arrives. However the impact on productivity should be small thanks to the benefits gained from
the modernisation of systems. Past experience of other disruptive shocks suggests that severe or long–lasting output effects are unlikely. For example, a seven–month closure of
clearing banks in Ireland in 1970 resulted in a major disturbance to the payments system but had very little effect on overall spending or activity; similarly a three–day working week
during the winter of 1974 in the United Kingdom, imposed
due to power restrictions during a coal miners’ strike, was disruptive but overall macroeconomic effects are difficult to
identify.

only a slight rebound in 2000 on the back of a recovery of
world economic activity. The oil price (around 13 USD/
barrel for Brent oil in March) is around the average value
recorded in 1998 which represented a fall of over 30% compared to the previous year. Despite efforts by OPEC and
other producers to cut production it is expected that the current supply overhang will not be eliminated in the short run.
Thus a further small drop in price is assumed for 1999
which is then reversed in 2000.

1. Recent economic developments
–25

Economic activity in the EU at the end of 1998 developed
roughly as anticipated in the previous forecast. In particular, domestic demand proved remarkably robust, to an extent that had not been observed since the beginning of the
1990s. Details on each EU country can be found further on
in the country section.
According to Eurostat figures, GDP in 98Q4 grew by 0.2%
qoq and 2.3% yoy in the EU, resulting in a 2.9% growth rate
in the EU for the year 1998 as a whole (i.e. as in the Autumn
1998 Forecast). If one concentrates on the profile, it appears
clearly that quarterly GDP growth peaked at the turn of
1997/98, and has since been on a declining trend. Domestic
components have remained robust in 1998. In particular,
private consumption (which grew by 2.8%), fuelled by increases in real disposable income, a fall in the saving ratio
of households and employment growth, contributed very
positively to GDP growth. Private investment accelerated
strongly in 1998 as well. The improved domestic demand
outlook together with favourable financing conditions
boosted equipment investment (8.4%) and also allowed a
pick–up in investment in the construction sector (1.8%) following several years of subdued growth. GDP growth in
1998 would have easily surpassed 3% had it not been for the
contribution of net exports, which became increasingly
negative from 98Q1 onwards.
The growth rate of industrial production in the EU peaked
during 98Q1 at rates around 5 to 6% yoy. It decelerated
gradually thereafter to 3.0% yoy in 98Q3. More recently, in
December 1998, the growth rate was almost flat. The

same slowing is evident in all major countries. The latest
figures available point to growth which is virtually flat in
Germany, France and the UK, negative in Italy, but still of
the order of 3 to 4% yoy in Spain. Leading indicators point
to further weakening ahead. A reduction of output in the
industrial sector seems very likely in the EU as a whole during the first half of 1999.

Survey indicators to February 1999 continue to display a
widening gap between business confidence and consumer
confidence. This divergence that first appeared in March–
April 1998, has been lasting for an unusually long period of
time. Industrial confidence in the EU has fallen below its
long–term average, while consumer confidence stands
above its peak of the previous cycle. An explanation for
this constellation has to be sought in the nature of the external shock which hit the EU economy. Indeed, the dichotomy applies to all sectors of economic activity according to
their exposure to the international competition. Typically,
industrialists operating in the highly exposed sector of
manufacturing goods report more pessimism than can be
seen from the surveys in the relatively sheltered sectors of
construction and retail trade. The capacity utilisation ratio
in the manufacturing industry eased somewhat to 81.6% in
January 1999, compared to a peak of 83.6% in 98Q3.

2. Monetary developments
While last year financial markets had directly or indirectly
been heavily influenced by the turbulence especially in
Asia, Russia and Latin America, early 1999 has seen a certain revival of domestic factors. Low rates of inflation, central banks’ determination to focus on price stability as well
as the strength of domestic activity received a lot of attention. The stronger emphasis financial markets put on domestic factors is reflected in differences between developments in Europe and elsewhere both in terms of interest
rates and exchange rates.

Long–term interest rates in the euro area continued to decline in the first weeks of 1999 when government bond
yields reached all–time lows close to 3% (10–year benchmark) before the decline of interest rates came to a halt. The
decline in early 1999 followed the already substantial drop
in long–term rates observed last year. Apart from global
factors like the ”flight to quality” phenomenon triggered by
financial crisis, institutional change and internal factors
contributed to the declining trend. Among the institutional
factors the disappearance of exchange rate uncertainty in
the euro area has gradually eliminated risk premia that were
associated with this risk until the move to Stage Three of
EMU. Among the internal factors it is mainly the high level
of price stability and the outlook for its continuation, together with progress in budgetary consolidation which are
reflected in recent developments. In fact, the favourable
outlook for price stability seems to have created confidence
in financial markets and thereby reduced inflationary expectations. As many of these factors will remain in place up
to the forecast horizon no significant changes in long–term
interest rates are assumed up to the end of 2000. Temporary
changes in long–term rates like those observed during the
first quarter of 1999 appear to be consistent with this assumption as their explanation is mainly provided by developments in capital markets outside the euro area where
inflationary fears had already led to an increase in US long–
term rates somewhat earlier.
GRAPH 7: Real interest rates (nominal rates minus CPI, HICP from 1996)

Short–term interest rates in the euro area stayed close to
three percent in the first three months of 1999. This level
had already been approached on 3 December 1998 when
national central banks in the designated euro area simultaneously cut key interest rates to 3.0%, except Italy, where
interest rates were finally cut to 3.0% on 23 December. The
expected smooth convergence toward this relatively low
nominal starting level brought substantial interest rate cuts
for many Member States through the course of last year,
sometimes more than halving the level seen one year
earlier. Taking over responsibility in 1999, the ECB has set
an interest rate of 3% applicable to its refinancing operations,
resulting in three–month money market rates close to 3%.

Short–term interest rates outside the euro area have declined in most industrial countries throughout 1998 and
early 1999. In the ERM2, Danish key rates were cut several
times, and Greek short–term rates have returned to the
downward path which they left following last year’s devaluation that accompanied the start of Greece’s ERM participation. For the two Member States neither participating
in EMU nor ERM2, short–term rates in Sweden are already
approaching the euro area’s level, while in the United Kingdom the rate is still considerably above that of the euro area.
Outside Europe the Fed has cut US rates three times (by 25
bps each time) lowering three–month rates slightly below
the 5% level. Japanese short–term rates, which were already the lowest of all industrial countries, have declined
again in 1999 towards 0.3% and the overall situation does
not suggest major changes over the forecast period.

Box 1: Technical Points
Unchanged policy assumption

The euro in the forecasts

The forecasts are made under the assumption of unchanged
policies. Only measures adopted or known in sufficient detail
are included. This is of particular importance in the field of
budgetary and monetary policy.

On 1.1.99 the currencies of the Member States adopting the
single currency were replaced by the euro, but during the
transitional period until the end of 2001, the national currency
units will continue as subdivisions of the euro. Statistical
series in national currencies have been kept in the same denomination in the forecasts. With regard to series in ECU, they
have been left unchanged for the past, but are expressed in
euro from 1.1.99. The euro series are the statistical continuation of the ECU series.

The public finance figures up to 1998 are those notified by the
Member States in March 1999 under the Excessive Deficit
Procedure. These figures have been validated by Eurostat.
With respect to 1999 all countries have presented their
budgets. The forecasts for 1999 assume the budgets are fully
implemented. For 2000, the no–policy change assumption
implies that presently known measures (if not one–offs) and
trends are extrapolated. Figures are compatible with ESA79
accounting rules.
The evolution of monetary variables is governed by technical
assumptions. Depending on the case exchange rates are held
constant in nominal or real terms starting from a level observed in the recent past. Interest rates are set in order to have
a neutral impact on the economy.
ESA95
The new system of national accounts in the EU will be ESA95
from April 1999. Until then Member Countries may use the
old system of accounts, called ESA79. However, some
countries have already introduced or plan to introduce ESA95
before April 1999. Denmark was the first country to use
ESA95 accounts and the Autumn 1998 forecasts were established on the new statistical basis for the first time. The only
exception concerns the government deficit presented in the
current forecasts for Denmark, which is still on an ESA79
basis, in order to be compatible with the reported public finance data (Regulation (EC) N° 3605/93). An adjustment line
has been introduced in order to allow for the difference in the
government deficit under ESA95 and ESA79.
The UK moved to ESA95 in September 1998. The tables
since the Autumn 1998 forecasts have, hence, been prepared
in line with the ESA95 definitions. The changes to historical
data are significant and embody other methodological
changes including re–basing. In Ireland they have already included some of the ESA95 changes, notably on the trade side,
but until it is possible to have a full set of national accounts
based on the new system the forecasts continue to be based on
the ESA79 system.
Finland moved to ESA95 in the beginning of 1999, but the
current forecasts were prepared according to the old classification because the full new data set is not yet available.

Current account
The figures on the current account in the EU overstate the surplus because imports within the EU appear to be underrecorded. If bilateral trade flows were correctly measured, the
sum of intra–EU exports should be equal by definition to the
sum of intra–EU imports. There is a problem since 1993 when
the gap between the two series widened. It is due to the introduction of the Single Market which simplified international
transactions by abolishing some formalities at the border, but
this occurred at some cost of statistical accuracy. Eurostat is
attempting to remedy this shortcoming. Based on provisional
data published by Eurostat, the current account surplus for the
EU as a whole is estimated to be only 0.9% of GDP in 1997,
instead of 1.5% when based on the aggregation of data from
national sources, implying a discrepancy of 0.6 % of GDP.
For the euro area the adjusted current account surplus is estimated at 1.4% in 1997 (compared to a surplus based on data
from national sources of 1.8%), implying a discrepancy of 0.4
percentage point. In the forecast tables the EU and EUR11 aggregates for the current account balance continue for the time
being to be based on the sum of the national figures.

Long–term interest rates outside the euro area declined
throughout 1998 both in European economies and in the
USA and Japan. While the global factors have been the
same as those described for the euro area, the internal factors have been rather different. In the four EU Member
States outside the euro area yields have increased by approximately 50 bps between early January and early March
1999 which still implies for all except Greece current levels
below those in the first half of 1998 and below last year’s
average. While in the USA and Japan long–term rates declined in 1998, this year long–term bond yields have increased to levels substantially above that observed last year.
In US markets increased inflationary concern caused by a
surprisingly strong performance of the US economy and
market expectations concerning the future stance of monetary policy contributed to a sharp increase towards 5½% in
March (from 4¾% in the fourth quarter of 1998). In Japan

sumptions for exchange rates now imply constant nominal
exchange rates between ERM2 currencies and the euro, and
constant real exchange rates between the euro and ERM2
currencies against the other European and non–European
currencies. Exchange rates between the euro and non–
ERM2 currencies for 99Q1 are set at the average of historical data between 11 February and 11 March. The choice of
this period implies a USD/euro rate of 1.10 (equivalent to
1.77 DEM/USD). This means a depreciation by 1.2% this
year on the average of the nominal effective exchange rate
of the euro area vis–à–vis other industrialised economies.

the increase in yields occurred already in January when
markets anticipated the huge increase in public borrowing
that is expected as a consequence of fiscal measures.
Foreign exchange markets remained relatively calm in the
last quarter of 1998 following a period of months of a
weakening US dollar. The rebound of the dollar that has
taken place since early 1999 has restored the situation that
prevailed one year ago. This development is also reflected
in the USD/euro rate which declined from a starting rate of
1.18 to rates close to 1.10 (mid–March), returning approximately to the level of the USD/Ecu rate seen one year ago.
Also the development of the JPY/USD exchange rate supports the view of a strengthening dollar. After a period of
recovery from the rather high JPY/USD rates of last
summer, the Japanese currency has again lost some ground
vis–à–vis the US dollar. Sterling sustained its strength
throughout last year and its current level of 0.67 GBP/euro
is close to last year’s average but somewhat stronger than in
early January, exhibiting a pattern similar to that of the
USD/ECU rate. Since ERM2 started on 1 January 1999
both the DKK and the GRD have remained roughly stable
against the euro.
The formulation of the exchange rate assumptions takes
into account the fixed conversion rates prevailing since the
introduction of the euro on 1 January. The technical as-

Stock markets in the euro area displayed a V–shaped evolution since mid–July 1998. The decline by approximately
one third until early October has since been reversed. In
mid–March 1999, euro area stock market indices are approximately 15% higher than one year ago. A similar volatility has been observed on US markets where stock prices
went sharply down in autumn last year and where the rebound has pushed stock prices to levels considerably above
those seen one year earlier. Japanese stock prices which
were on a downward trend from the mid–nineties have
shown some strength in the first half of March 1999 following a period of stabilisation around last year’s average.
Given the global slowdown of economic growth, the overall performance of stock markets appears relatively strong.

3. The external shock has a major impact on the outlook

GRAPH 13: Stockbuilding and its assessment in EU–15

Turning to the forecast period, the slowdown envisaged this
year in the EU is now sharper than was expected 5 months
ago. The negative impact from the cut in the growth rates of
world GDP and trade had been underestimated in the previous forecast. In particular, the negative spillover from the
external environment to the exposed sector had been underestimated. This negative drag is also forecast to last longer
than previously thought. Instead of 2.4% as forecast last autumn, GDP growth in the EU is now expected to grow by
2.1% in 1999.

Among demand components, net exports and equipment investment are likely to suffer most in 1999, while consumption and construction should prove more robust. Indeed, the
external shock which affects the European economies has
asymmetric effects across economic agents: positive for
consumers but negative for industrial producers, while the
service sector is relatively sheltered. On balance, households’ confidence will cushion the slowdown, but lower
stockbuilding, subdued investment and weak net exports
together will knock a substantial amount off growth this year.
In 1999, both exports and imports of goods and services are
forecast to slow further towards respectively 3.5% and
4.7%. Net exports are forecast to post another negative contribution of –0.4 point to GDP growth.
The (industrial) supply side of the economy is affected by
steadily declining business confidence. It is not only the
downgraded export order–books which fuel this pessimism, but also falling producer prices in the face of rigid
costs (wages and interest rates). Falling import prices could
only partially offset these negative influences. In this situation of pressure on profits, industrialists are expected to
scale down their investment plans and run down their inventories. Equipment investment is forecast to slow to an
increase of 3.8%.

The sector of manufacturing industry represents only part
of total value–added or employment. More sheltered sectors such as services or construction should prove more robust. In particular, construction investment is expected to
continue accelerating to 3.5% in 1999.
Fluctuations in inventory investment can be an important
propagation mechanism for business cycles. They sometimes explain a considerable fraction of changes in GDP, as
was the case in a positive way in 1998. Based on survey evidence, the large stockbuilding was not considered excessive in the first half of last year, suggesting it was forward
looking behaviour to meet future demand. In the second
half of last year, inventories were considered increasingly
excessive. Therefore, the accumulation of stocks will be
lower and the contribution of inventories to GDP growth is
set to turn negative in 1999. However, one has to be aware
of measurement difficulties. Under the headline “inventories” are often grouped true inventories plus statistical
discrepancies. This could also explain the difference observed in 1998 in some countries between the assessment

reported in the surveys and the high level of stockbuilding
displayed in national accounts.
Finally, private consumption should remain relatively
strong. Unemployment is likely to continue declining because negative developments in industry are more than
offset by positive ones in the services sector; declining
inflation boosts purchasing power; low interest rates foster
consumption. This bright environment for households is reflected by record high consumer confidence displayed in
the surveys. According to the forecast, private consumption should grow by 2.6% (i.e. almost the same growth rate
as in 1998).
As regards 2000, a rebound in EU GDP growth to 2.7% is
forecast, assuming robust domestic forces and a gradual
improvement in the world environment. In sharp contrast
to the years 1994–97 when foreign trade exerted a strongly
positive influence on GDP growth and helped sustain activity, the EU will have to rely mainly on its own forces to realise the rebound. As already seen, private consumption is
expected to be practically unscathed by the slowdown,
which provides a robust outlook for producers. The slowdown in output growth is assumed to be only temporary and
limited to the sector of manufactured goods. Demand expectations by industrialists seem to have reached a turning
point, which would point to a recovery of corporate investment as from 99Q2. Following a year 1999 in which capacity and inventories unwind, equipment investment is forecast to re–accelerate in 2000. The contribution of
inventories should return to neutral, while the construction
sector is expected to continue recovering, benefiting in particular from continued low interest rates. The previously
negative contribution of trade is likely to turn close to neutral, assuming a recovery in world demand.

thus reducing the trade surplus of the euro area. Inflationary
pressures remain absent this year and only small increases
in inflation rates are forecast for next year. Employment
creation (0.9%) goes on but at a lower pace than last year.
Among the economies belonging to the euro area Ireland
remains the fastest growing economy while Italy and Germany are expected to lag behind the EU average.
4. Further improvement in the employment field
Employment growth in the EU turned out particularly
strong in 1998. The 1.1% increase (corresponding to the
creation of 1.7 million jobs) represents the best performance recorded since 1990. Despite the sharp slowdown expected this year in output growth, employment in the EU is
still forecast to grow by 0.8% each year in 1999 and 2000
(corresponding to the creation of around 2.5 millions jobs
over the two years). Indeed, the labour–content of GDP
growth has increased over recent years, against the background of a stable macroeconomic framework and under
the impact of the active labour market policies implemented in most member countries. Another explanation is the
gradual shift towards the more labour intensive service sector. It is worth noticing also that Germany put a halt in 1998
to previously steadily falling employment levels and that
small positive employment growth rates are forecast in
1999 and 2000.

To a large extent, the difference between the EU as a whole
and the euro area is imputable to the UK economy, which is
in a different position of the business cycle and hit by the
strength of sterling. Given the weight of the euro area in the
EU–15 aggregate, it is not surprising that differences are
small. Expected GDP growth in 1999 in the euro area
(2.2%) is mainly due to strong private consumption reflecting high levels of consumer confidence. All other components of domestic demand are now assessed as performing
less strongly than expected last autumn. Export growth will
be slower than last year and exceeded by import growth,

As a consequence of these favourable developments, unemployment in the EU declined by a substantial amount in
1998. It fell from 10.6% of the labour force in 1997 to
10.0% in 1998. A further decrease, at a pace of around a
half percentage point per year is forecast in 1999 and 2000.
Turning to the Member States, all, except the UK, continue
to display a decline in unemployment rates over the forecasting period. In this respect, the best performances are
expected in Spain and Ireland, where unemployment rates
should be cut by 3 percentage points between 1998 and 2000.

about deflation, defined as a generalised and sustained decline in prices and economic activity. These fears should
not be exaggerated as the underlying rate of inflation, when
volatile food and energy prices are excluded, is more stable
and has declined less spectacularly. The underlying rate of
inflation is estimated to be around 1.2 %, suggesting that
deflation is further away than is perhaps suggested by a first
reading of the headline figure. In addition, current levels of
economic activity do not point towards any risk of this kind.
GRAPH 15: Harmonised index of consumer prices

5. Inflation is heading towards record lows

10

Inflation in the EU continued to decrease in 1998 as it has
been doing steadily since 1991. The inflation rate
(measured by the deflator of private consumption) in the
EU fell from 2.1% in 1997 to 1.5% in 1998. As regards
1999, it is now expected to fall further to the record low of
1.3%. A similar trend is evident in most member countries.
In the Autumn Forecast, inflation in 1998 and 1999 had
been over–estimated. In particular, in France, Ireland,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden the
downward revision for 1999 between the present forecast
and the previous forecast exceeds half of a percentage
point. As regards 2000 as well, a downward revision has
been made to the EU inflation rate, which is now forecast to
increase slightly to 1.6% (instead of 1.8%).
In particular falling import prices, expressed both in US
dollars and national currency, pulled inflation down in 1998
and led to a positive terms of trade effect. This explains
why in some Member States the discrepancy between the
deflator of GDP and of private consumption is unusually
large. The latter is dampened by the declining import
prices, while the former is not. The annual rise of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the EU as a whole
fell to 0.9 % in January 1999 and in several Member States
to below 0.5 %, under the influence of cheap imports.
These low headline inflation rates have raised worries

Taking a somewhat longer historical perspective, beyond
the recent disinflationary consequence of the external
shock affecting the EU economy (falling oil and commodity prices, falling producer prices, increased competition in
the tradeable goods sector), a remarkable degree of price
stability has been obtained in the EU. Moderate wage developments have contributed to this achievement. Nominal
wage increases are expected to remain subdued (around
3 % in 1999 and 2000). However, weak productivity
growth, especially in 1999, will bring about a relatively
sharp increase in nominal unit labour costs.

Surplus of 3.5% of GDP projected for 2005.
Prudent scenario. Deficit of 1.7, 1.2 and 0.8% of GDP in 2000–2002 under favourable scenario.

Surplus of 0.1% of GDP projected for the financial year 2003/2004.

The public finance forecasts for 1999 are based on the
measures presented in the national budgets for that year. A
stabilisation in the general government deficit at 1.5 % of
GDP for the EU as whole and further decline to 1.9% for the
euro area is forecast. As economic conditions are less good,
the reduction in the deficit/GDP ratio relies on the implementation of the announced measures and one cannot count
on a large cyclical component. Lower interest payments
should also contribute. The deficit as a percentage of GDP
declines in all Member States except Germany and the
Netherlands. The surplus in the UK becomes a small deficit.

In 1998 the average government deficit in the EU as a percentage of GDP declined further to 1.5 %, which is better
than expected in the Autumn 1998 Forecast. This result
was largely obtained thanks to stronger growth and lower
interest payments. The underlying budgetary position
hardly improved in several Member States. For the first
time, all Member States had a government balance in 1998
better than the deficit reference value of 3 % of GDP. The
number of countries showing a surplus in their budgetary
balances increased to six: Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg,
Finland, Sweden, and United Kingdom. However, six
Member States still had a deficit of more than 2 % of GDP;
in order of the size of deficit/GDP these countries were
France, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Germany and Austria.

The main impetus for the reduction in the deficit ratio
comes from declining expenditure, which has been falling
as a proportion of GDP since 1994. Between 1998 and 2000
the share of government expenditure in GDP in the EU as a
whole is expected to decrease by about 0.8 percentage
points to 47.0%. However, general government receipts are
also on a declining path as a proportion of GDP, having
peaked in 1997, and are expected to represent 45.7% of
GDP for the EU as a whole in 2000. This is the result of tax
reforms and tax cuts.
The fall in the debt burden relative to GDP is expected to
continue implying a decline of the EU average government
debt from a peak level of 72.8% in 1996 to 68.6 % in 1999
and 67.0% in 2000. In France, Luxembourg, Finland and
the United Kingdom the debt ratio remains below 60%.
Denmark, Ireland, and Portugal have joined this group in
1998. In Ireland the debt/GDP ratio is expected to continue

Market (see Box 2). Estimates by Eurostat to correct for this
suggest the current account surplus in 1997 amounted to
0.9% of GDP in the EU and 1.4% in the euro area (representing an upward bias in the uncorrected data of 0.6 and
0.4 percentage point respectively). Assuming this bias remains roughly constant, the forecast figures could be adjusted down by similar amounts.

falling at a rapid pace (by about 10 percentage points annually) during the 1999–2000 period. By 2000 Ireland will
have the second lowest debt/GDP ratio (34.5 %) in the EU,
while in 1987 it had the second highest ratio in the EU (peak
level of 114.9 %). In all Member States with debt/GDP ratios above 60 %, the ratio is expected to decrease over the
forecasting period except in Germany where it remains
stable at about 61.0 % of GDP. Further declines are also
seen in countries with ratios already below 60 % of GDP
with the exception of France where it turns down only in the
last forecast year; in Luxembourg a rise from the current
very low levels is expected.
7. Decline in the EU current account surplus
After peaking at 1.5% of GDP in 1997 and falling to 1.2% in
1998, the EU current account surplus is set to fall below 1%
during the forecast period. The fall in the EUR–11 surplus
from 1.8% in 1997 to 1.4% in 2000 is less marked because
of the exclusion of sharply deteriorating UK balances.
These new figures represent a significant downward revision to the current account forecasts made last autumn in
line with the less favourable international environment now
assumed. The already much larger Japanese current account surplus is set to increase further, in contrast to a rapidly widening US deficit.
The figures for the EU are biased upwards because of an underreporting of imports since the introduction of the Single

Despite a difficult external environment, 1998 turned out to
be a positive year in terms of output growth in most EU
Member States. Ten economies displayed GDP growth
rates between 2½ and 4% in 1998. Three economies (Finland, Luxembourg, Ireland) grew even more strongly, with
Ireland ahead of all of them catching up further again at a
double–digit rate. Only Italy and the United Kingdom
lagged behind where the slower pace of expansion in the
latter has to be attributed to the different cyclical position.
Among the continental Member States cyclical positions
are very similar and due to ongoing convergence the economic development appears roughly the same in many respects. Nevertheless, there are several country– specific elements that can explain differences among Member States
concerning the economic situation and the outlook contained in the Spring 1999 Forecast.
Belgium
The pace of economic activity decelerated in the second
half of 1998 mainly as a result of faltering external demand.
In fact, the advanced indicator of economic activity, published by the Central Bank, has been falling since the fourth
quarter of 1997 and more markedly since November 1998.

(a) Annual percentage change, (b) Harmonised index of consumer prices (c) % of

As a result of further deceleration in activity during the first
half of the year, real GDP growth is expected to slowdown
from 2.9 % in 1998 to 1.9 % in 1999; however a rapid recovery is foreseen from the second semester of the year.
These movements are mainly related to external developments while domestic demand is expected to continue to be
supportive in 1999, reflecting favourable consumer confidence levels, low interest rates and import prices; nevertheless, increase in domestic demand should decelerate from
4.4 % in 1998 to 2.4 % in the current year.
Private consumption is foreseen to increase by 2.4 % reflecting improvement in employment, a moderate rise in
real disposable income, and persisting consumer confidence. Private investment should decelerate from 5 % in
1998 to 4 % in 1999, as a result of a reduction in capacity
utilisation registered in the latest months of 1998 and the

– 13 –

likely postponement of investment decisions. Acceleration
in gross capital formation and in exports will be the main
driving factors of real GDP recovery in 2000 to 2.5 %.
Wage moderation and measures taken in recent years in favour of employment creation, particularly reduced social
contributions for lower paid jobs, are expected to alleviate
the negative impact of the slowdown in activity on the labour market. Total employment growth should decelerate
from 1.3 % in 1998 to 0.7 % in 1999 and then recover
somewhat to 0.9 % in 2000. The standardised unemployment rate is forecast to decline from 8.8% in 1998 to 8.3 %
in 1999 and to about 7.8% in 2000.
Nominal compensation of employees per head is expected
to rise on average by about 2¼ % per year in the period
1999–2000 implying real increases of about 1 percentage
point in both years. Consumer prices are expected to increase by 1 % in 1999, as in 1998, and to slightly accelerate
in 2000 as a result of stronger demand.
The general government deficit declined from 1.9 % of
GDP in 1997 to 1.3 % in 1998 reflecting the effect of strong
economic growth, in particular dynamic private consumption, and falling interest payments. On the basis of the current stance of fiscal policy, including a planned reduction in
social security contributions in the coming years, the government deficit is estimated to fall to just under 1 % of GDP
in 1999. In fact, the expected slowdown in economic activity should not have a significant effect on the projected deficit. The reduction in the deficit in 1999 will be partly due to
the fact that one–off expenditures were undertaken in 1998,
while lower than normal non–tax revenue were recorded;
moreover, in 1999, roll–over of part of the public debt will
be executed at declining interest rates.
Denmark
Following real GDP growth of about 2.7% in 1998, economic activity is expected to slow down in 1999 with annual
GDP growth of about 1.7%. Growth of domestic demand
should weaken to annual 2.0%, partly induced by the
“Whitsun package”. The “Whitsun package”, which was
adopted in June 1998, aims at stabilising domestic demand,
the main instruments being different tax measures such as a
reduction in the tax allowance for interest payments on
mortgage loans. Exports, which in 1998 were depressed by
the large labour market conflict, should improve. In the
year 2000 a slight recovery is expected, with GDP growing
by some 2.0%.
The weakening of domestic demand in 1999 is mainly due
to a slackening of private consumption as the rise in both
employment and housing prices, the main driving factors in
1998, is expected to fade out. Moreover, the effects of the
Whitsun package should dampen the disposable income of
households.
Investment is expected to slow considerably in 1999. This
is in particular valid for equipment investment since demand expectations are at a very low level, profit margins
are falling and capacity utilisation has decreased significantly during the last months. The growth rate of investment in non–residential construction should also decline,

mainly as a result of a reduction in infrastructure investment. However, the growth rate of residential construction
is anticipated to decrease only slightly as the effect of the
reduced tax deduction for mortgage loans included in the
Whitsun package will be largely offset by lower interest
rates.
Exports are expected to increase somewhat, which mainly
corresponds to a technical rebound following the labour
market conflict in spring last year. However, they will remain moderate due to reduced growth in Danish export
markets and a further loss of market shares. Import growth
will be dampened by the general slowdown in domestic demand and, as a result, the balance of trade of goods and services should improve.
In 2000, the impact of the Whitsun package on both consumption and residential construction should be stronger
since interest rates are assumed to increase slightly. The external contribution to GDP growth should further ameliorate and the balance in the trade of services should improve.

Unemployment decreased significantly during 1998, reaching some 5%. The labour market is expected to remain
rather tight and unemployment is forecast to decline further
in 1999 and edge up in 2000.
The tight labour market in 1998 was reflected in wage increases of about 4.4%. This situation is expected to continue in 1999 and 2000 with wage increases of some 4%.
Consumer prices increased by 1.3% in 1998. In 1999, the
HICP is expected to rise by about 1.7%. The increase in
comparison to 1998 is due to higher indirect taxes on energy
and the absence of the moderating effect of falling import
prices observed in 1998. The increase in the HICP is forecast to level off in 2000.
Government finances are expected to remain sound. For
1999 a budget surplus of about 2.8% is forecast and the government’s gross debt could fall below 55% of GDP. For
2000 a budget surplus of about 3.0% is expected and the
gross debt could fall to close to 50% of GDP.
Germany
The German economy grew by a fairly strong 2.8% in 1998.
Towards the end of the year, however, the negative effects
of the international economic slowdown made themselves
felt, particularly in the industrial sector. In the fourth
quarter, GDP contracted by almost half a point on the
quarter, despite robust private consumption. The forecast

– 14 –

does not incorporate the revision in 1998 GDP data published in March 1999. The revision of the data, however,
does not alter the scenario presented in the forecast.
GDP growth is likely to remain subdued in the first quarter
of 1999. Depressed business confidence is likely to restrain
investment; moreover, survey results seem to indicate that
enterprises increasingly consider their stocks of finished
products to be too high. This might well lead to destocking,
and therefore lower production, in the first half of 1999.
From then on, however, a gradual recovery is expected, because the effects of the international financial crisis should
fade out and private consumption should be increasingly
buoyant. The decline in interest rates, witnessed during
1998, should also tend to support economic growth. Overall, the economy should improve in the course of the year,
but, owing to a weak overhang at the end of 1998 and to a
subdued first quarter, GDP is expected to expand by only
about 1.7% in 1999. In 2000, GDP growth could reach
2.4%.

Private consumption will continue to accelerate in 1999,
supported by a very low inflation rate and a sustained improvement of labour incomes. Furthermore, consumers’
confidence has continued to improve in the last months, not
least owing to the clear fall in unemployment from its peak
at the end of 1997. In the year 2000, however, a slightly
higher inflation is expected to erode part of the gains in
households’ purchasing power, leading to a slight deceleration in real private consumption growth rate. Government
consumption is likely to grow less than GDP in both 1999
and in 2000.
Investment is not expected to show much dynamism in
1999. Business confidence declined sharply during 1998
and until now, no improvement has been seen. Manufacturers in particular are hit by a contraction in orders at the
end of 1998, an acceleration in wages and, at least in the
short term, a higher fiscal burden due to the closing of tax
loopholes. Even though businesses operating in the service
sector should benefit from stronger domestic demand, the
now higher degree of uncertainty is likely to result in increased caution in decisions involving investments or personnel. The improvement in the economic situation will in
due course lead to more investment, but this will pay off
mostly in 2000. Thus, equipment investment is forecast to
grow distinctly less in 1999 than in 1998. As for construction investment, the outlook remains subdued.
Exports declined sharply in the last quarter of 1998. Clearly, the deceleration of exports is set to continue in 1999;

nevertheless, export markets should begin to recover this
year. Furthermore, exports will also be supported by the reversal of the currency appreciation of the second half of
1998. The improvement should be clearer in 2000 as the effects of the international crisis fade out. Imports, stimulated
by higher private consumption, should outpace exports,
leading to a negative overall growth contribution in 1999.
The external growth contribution is, however, expected to
become positive again in 2000.
The labour market situation is not expected to improve
much in 1999. The increase in the budget for active labour
market policies envisaged in the 1999 budget will, however, on average avoid a deterioration of the situation compared to 1998. Stronger growth should again lead to net job
creation by the private sector in the year 2000. Against this
background and also thanks to demographic trends, unemployment is expected to decrease further, but will stay close
to 4 million on an annual average basis.
Despite a 1–point increase in the VAT rate in April 1998,
inflation fell to only 0.2% year–on–year by early 1999,
thanks to sharp declines in import prices and unit labour
costs. CPI inflation should remain well below 1% in 1999,
even though wages growth and unit labour costs are expected to accelerate compared to 1998. In 2000, only a marginal pick–up in inflation is expected.
The general government deficit declined further in 1998,
from 2% to close to 2% of GDP. Given the economic
slowdown and low inflation, which reduces the growth of
nominal GDP, a marginal increase in the deficit is expected
in 1999, even though budgetary planning continues to be
oriented towards containing expenditure. The debt ratio
should remain close to present levels throughout the forecast period.
Greece
The performance of the Greek economy continued to improve: GDP growth accelerated while significant progress
was achieved in curbing inflation and correcting fiscal imbalances. In March 1998, the drachma entered the ERM at a
central rate representing a 12.1% devaluation of the
currency. Domestic demand, in particular private consumption, slowed somewhat in 1998, under the combined impact
of the devaluation and the moderate wage settlement. Investment activity continued to be strong while exports contributed to the acceleration in real output to an estimated
rate of growth of 3.7%. Real output growth might decelerate temporarily in 1999 due to less dynamic export activity
but domestic demand is expected to accelerate this year.
Private consumption is forecast to recover in line with increasing real disposable income as the tax system is reaching its maturity. Investment is expected to remain the driving force of domestic demand.
The situation in the labour market improved in 1998, albeit
marginally, and the unemployment rate resumed a slow
downward path. The improvement in the labour market is
expected to be supported in the remainder of the forecasting
period by sustained activity and the announced plans for
structural reform. Real wages decelerated significantly in
1998, reflecting the restrictive incomes policy in the public
sector and the two–year wage agreement signed in May in

– 15 –

the private sector, which provides for nominal wage increases on the basis of expected inflation. With real wages
growing below labour productivity, unit labour costs are
forecast to rise at a moderate pace in both years.
Slowing demand and labour costs assisted the containment
of inflation in the post–devaluation period. On average consumer prices rose by 4.8% in 1998, down from 5.5% in
1997. In this context, the appreciation of the drachma and
low international commodity prices played a significant
role, while underlying inflation was also on a downward
path during the second half of 1998. Slowing labour costs,
lower indirect taxes and international commodity prices are
expected to contribute to further disinflation during the
forecasting period. Year–on–year CPI inflation reached
3.7% in January and February 1999, and is expected to decelerate further as from April when the impact of the last
year devaluation will be fully absorbed.

Public finance posted an uninterrupted improvement since
1994. The March 1998 devaluation was accompanied by
fiscal measures aimed at preventing any overshoot in the
budgetary targets. Due to the successful implementation of
the accompanying measures, the general government deficit was 2.4% of GDP in 1998 as targeted in the convergence
programme. Government debt was reduced by 2.9 percentage points of GDP, mainly due to higher receipts from privatisation, following the implementation of the structural
part of the accompanying measures.
For 1999, the deficit of the general government is forecast
to be 2.1% of GDP. Risks emanating from current revenues
and primary expenditure are relatively small. This is particularly true on the revenue side which benefits from
growth dividend and the maturity of the fiscal system. The
primary surplus is expected to reach 6.5% of GDP in 1999
and 2000 thus contributing to a further decline in the debt
ratio in both years.

deceleration of Spanish exports during 1999. As a result,
GDP growth is expected to moderate to 3.3% in 1999. This
scenario would lead to an accentuation of the trends previously observed: a healthy domestic demand and a growing
negative contribution from the external sector. As domestic
conditions are expected to remain growth–supportive, the
foreseen gradual improvement of external demand from the
end of 1999 would push output growth in 2000 towards an
average rate of 3.5%.

During 1999 domestic demand should remain strong, despite the worsening in the international situation, based on
the strengthening of private consumption and investment in
construction. In 1999 private consumption is to keep its
previous strong pace mainly due to the personal income tax
reform implemented since January this year, which will
imply an increase in households’ disposable income. Additionally, although more moderately than in 1998, job creation would still be significant. Regarding investment in
construction, its dynamism would stem from higher public
construction and the historically low interest rates which
will boost residential construction. In contrast, investment
in equipment is likely to slow down during 1999 due to the
less dynamic external demand.
As for 2000, private consumption is expected to decelerate
slightly in line with the moderation of households’ incomes
due to the fading away of the first impacts of the tax reform.
As investment in construction is also likely to grow more
moderately, domestic demand should be increasingly supported by the recovery in investment in equipment, thanks
to the improvement in international economic prospects.

Spain

Employment rose briskly by 3.3% in 1998 and in 1999 is
expected to decelerate in line with economic activity to
2.6%. These favourable developments can be partially explained by the labour market reforms implemented in recent years which have improved labour flexibility and have
contributed to wage moderation. As a result, the still very
high unemployment rate would continue decreasing to
reach 17.3% in 1999 compared to 18.8% in 1998.

GDP accelerated in 1998, increasing by 3.8% compared
with 3.5% in 1997. This acceleration took place mainly during the first half of the year, while in the second half activity
decelerated slightly due to the international environment.
Output growth was driven by domestic demand, especially
private consumption and investment in equipment, while
the external sector made a widening negative contribution.

Strong economic activity in Spain is compatible with subdued inflation rates. HICP inflation was 1.8% in 1998. As
energy and commodity prices are expected to remain low in
1999 and wage moderation is to continue, no inflationary
pressures are foreseen in the near future. In addition, the
large slack in labour resources and the deregulation
measures which are expected to be implemented should
also help to ease inflationary pressures.

The main impact of the unfavourable international setting
is being felt through the external sector leading to a further

The current account balance is expected to deteriorate gradually. Thus, in 1998, the surplus registered in 1997 shifted

– 16 –

into a deficit and in 1999 and 2000 this deficit is expected to
increase due to the growing trade deficit, which could not
be offset by the surplus in the service balance.

The other feature of the current recovery is low inflation.
This fell again, to 0.3% on a year–on–year basis by December 1998.

The general government deficit fell significantly from
2.6% of GDP in 1997 to a lower–than–expected 1.8% in
1998 which is below the target of 2.1% (when the budget
was presented the target was 2.5%), mainly a result of lower
government primary expenditure owing to the restraint of
government consumption.

Economic activity is likely to have slackened temporarily at
the turn of the year. This slowdown came sufficiently late
for its effect on annual growth in 1998 to be negligible, although it is likely to have a marked impact on growth in
1999. The contribution of foreign trade to GDP growth will
still be negative in 1999. Private consumption looks set for
sustained progress, although slowing down compared with
1998’s exceptional rate of growth. High levels of purchasing power and consumer confidence should be maintained
in 1999. The rise in average wages per head is expected to
slacken only slightly. At the same time, the pace of job creation is likely to remain sustained, notably in the construction and service industries and especially in the non–market
sector. In sum, the gains in the purchasing power of total
wages and salaries observed in 1998 should continue in
1999 and 2000.

In 1999, the general government deficit is expected to decline to 1.6% of GDP. The positive carry over effects in
1999 of the better–than–expected budgetary outcome in
1998 would be nearly cancelled out by the impact on the
public finances from slower growth in 1999. There are also
some uncertainties related to the final results for direct tax
revenues due to the personal income tax reform. As a result,
the deficit reduction in 1999 would rest mainly on the expected continuation in primary expenditure containment.
In the context of the usual unchanged economic policy assumption, the deficit would fall to 1.3% of GDP in 2000 in
the framework of a progressive recovery of economic activity.
In 1998, the debt–to–GDP ratio fell to 65.6%, and is expected to decline further to 64.7% in 1999 and to 62.4% in
2000. This reduction of the debt ratio would stem only from
the gradual improvement foreseen in the primary surplus.
Although the implicit interest rate of the debt would tend to
decrease, the expected deceleration of economic activity
along with a moderate inflation would also reduce nominal
GDP growth, leading to a slight debt increasing ”snow–ball
effect”.
France
The deterioration in the world economy slowed the pace of
recovery. The visible signs of this were the contraction of
foreign trade and the slowdown in stockbuilding against a
background of a deteriorating production outlook in manufacturing. There was a marked decline in exports under the
twin impact of the slowdown in worldwide demand and a
decline in competitiveness.
Nevertheless, the recovery that was first discernible in 1997
continued in 1998 as domestic demand became much
stronger, thereby permitting aggregate GDP growth of
3.2% and a healthy employment situation which allowed
the jobless rate to be trimmed back by more than one percentage point between mid–1997 and the end of 1998.

Housing investment, which was already staging a revival at
the end of 1998, should continue its upward trend in 1999
(+5.0%): demand for new houses is still very high and activity has intensified, equalling its 1990 peak.
Business behaviour is less certain. Despite the continuing
recovery in the financial position of enterprises, business
investment in plant and machinery is likely to be halved in
1999 (+4.2%) owing to the erosion of demand expectations. The current time lag before the impact on investment
is felt appears to be shorter than during the slowdown in
1995 and 1996. An upward adjustment in demand expectations, which seems to be taking place at the beginning of
1999, could pave the way for a resurgence in manufacturing
investment starting in the spring. Business investment in
building and construction, which started to improve in
1998, should speed up over the coming quarters.
Against this background, CPI inflation should remain in
check, holding steady at an annual average of around 0.5%
in 1999, before rising slightly in 2000. Compared with imported disinflation, there is no discernible wage pressure
despite the downward trend in unemployment.
In 1998 the general government deficit was reduced to
2.9% of GDP, slightly below the initial target of 3%. Revenues were higher than originally forecast and very tight
rein was kept on central government expenditure. However, substantial overspending was recorded for expenditure on sickness insurance.
In 1999 the deficit is currently estimated to fall to 2.4% of
GDP, primarily as a result of continued restraint in public
spending. There are mainly two major risks to this trend.
First, low inflation could exert a brake on revenues in nominal terms. Second, the forecast is based on the assumption
that the overspending on health will not be repeated. The
Government has made changes to certain taxes (the most
important one the removal over a five–year period of wages
from the basis of assessment for business tax) the overall
impact of which should slightly reduce the aggregate tax
burden. The slowdown in activity should have a relatively
small impact on government accounts owing to the nature
of the French tax system (the receipts from certain key taxes

meanwhile, have been in the opposite direction: +5.8% in
the year to September 1998 for industrial workers, +12.5%
in construction and +4.9% in the public sector in the year to
June 1998. With the extreme openness of the economy and
generally low international inflation there is little prospect
of externally driven inflation over the forecast period. This
should restrain consumer price increases. However, the
signs of overheating in the labour market are expected to
worsen and wage increases are therefore expected to rise
throughout the period of the forecast, with compensation
per head expected to be rising by over 7% in 2000.

The economy looks to have surpassed expectations once
again in 1998, with real GDP estimated to have increased
by almost 12%. The pace of expansion is projected to slow
only moderately over the period to 2000, as the components
of domestic demand in particular continue to grow strongly.

Employment growth should remain strong in both 1999
and 2000 but the decline in unemployment is expected to
remain lower than the rise in employment as participation
continues its long–term rise and inward migration continues.

such as personal income tax and corporation tax are collected one year after the underlying economic activity has
taken place) and, in particular, to the structure of growth.
In 2000 the government deficit is forecast to fall to 2.0% of
GDP under the no policy change assumption.
While still below 60%, the debt ratio is likely to continue to
rise in 1998 and 1999. The debt ratio is expected to start falling from 2000 onwards.

The growth of private consumption is expected to moderate
only slightly to about 7½% in 1999 as household disposable
incomes continue to be buoyed by rising compensation per
head, tax cuts, further growth in employment and reduced
mortgage interest payments. Consumption growth is expected to be 7% in 2000. Investment growth is expected to
slow a little over the forecast period. At the same time the
growth in public consumption should be restrained by the
Government’s intention to reduce the growth of current
government expenditure.

The substantial fall in interest rates in the last quarter of
1998 combined with tax cuts amounting to 1% of GDP and
additional expenditure commitments in the 1999 budget
should sustain the growth in domestic demand over the
forecast period. The 1999 budget also allows for a further
IEP 350 million (about ½% of GDP) of tax cuts in 2000
which should also sustain demand.
Exporters are expected to continue to make gains in market
share in line with the experience throughout the 1990s. The
continued strength of domestic demand in 1999 is, meanwhile, expected to sustain the growth of imports, thereby
further reducing the external contribution to growth. While
the merchandise trade balance nevertheless continues to remain in substantial surplus, both the services and the net
factor incomes balances are expected to decline, resulting
in a gradual reduction of the current account surplus over
the forecast period.
CPI inflation peaked at 3.2% year–on–year in August 1998
and has been on a steady downward trend since then. For
1998 as a whole the figure was 2.4%. Wage developments,

The combination of continued strong revenue growth in
line with the overall economy and more limited growth in
expenditure should see the budget surplus increase in both
1999 and 2000. The surplus should reach about 3% of GDP
in 2000 with the debt ratio falling to about 35% of GDP.
Italy
Unlike other European countries, economic growth in Italy
is expected to improve slightly in 1999, after the lower–
than–expected outcome of 1998. Real GDP growth is expected to strengthen moderately, from 1.4% in 1998 to
1.6% this year, and to increase to above 2% in 2000. Hence,
the significant difference in growth between Italy and other
countries of the euro zone is assumed to narrow gradually
during the forecasting period.

In 1999 lower interest rates should help sustain domestic
demand, which should continue to grow, net of stocks, at a
rate close to 2%. However, a marked destocking after the
huge inventory build–up recorded in 1998 will prevent total
domestic demand from growing faster. On the other hand,
the contribution of external trade, though remaining negative, is expected to cease to impose a severe constraint on
GDP growth. In 2000 economic growth is foreseen to be supported both by domestic demand and improving exports.
Private consumption in 1999 is expected to maintain broadly the same pace as in 1998 (just below 2%). In the context
of a further fall in inflation, higher real disposable income is
expected to support households’ consumption. A more pronounced acceleration is expected to take place in 2000. The
declining trend in the households’ saving ratio is expected
to continue, although at a markedly slower pace than observed between 1996 and 1998.

– 18 –

Total investment is expected to decelerate slightly in 1999,
on account of a marked slowdown of investment in equipment. Indeed, the recent decline in the level of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector and the fall in business
confidence are likely to restrain investment initiatives in the
short term. Later in the year, however, fixed capital formation should recover, thanks to improving demand prospects
and the announced changes in the tax treatment of reinvested profits. On the other hand, investment in construction, which remained considerably depressed in the last few
years, should restart, helped by the incentives for housing
restructuring and by the ongoing recovery of public investment. The recovery of total investment is expected to consolidate in 2000.
Export growth is foreseen to decelerate further in 1999, in
line with the expected evolution of world demand. In 2000,
the expected improvement in the international environment
should allow a less subdued export performance. Import
growth is expected to decelerate in 1999, as the exceptional
circumstances which have boosted imports in 1997–98 (car
incentives, restocking, international price developments)
will fade out. A visible acceleration is expected in 2000,
driven by stronger domestic demand. The trade balance is
likely to remain above 3% of GDP during the period under
consideration.
Employment is projected to improve gradually during the
forecast period. Notwithstanding the slow pace of the economic recovery, employment is expected to benefit – as already happened in 1998 – from higher flexibility in the labour market and from the various initiatives aimed at
reducing labour costs in the depressed areas.
Inflation is expected to remain subdued in 1999 in line with
the expected evolution in other euro–zone countries. Low
import prices, moderate output growth (leaving a negative
output gap) and continuing wage moderation should allow
a decline of CPI inflation to below 1.5% this year. Notwithstanding a slight acceleration in 2000, inflation is unlikely
to exceed 2% throughout the forecasting period.
As for public finances, the general government deficit is
estimated at 2.3% of GDP this year. The primary surplus is
likely to deteriorate slightly and to be well below the government’s target of 5.5%. Most of the slippage in the primary surplus is accounted for by lower–than–expected
growth (the government assumption for growth in 1999
was 2.5%). On the other hand, interest payments, which
were set at 7.5% of GDP in the government projections, are
likely to decline more rapidly, thereby limiting the overshooting of the deficit target. Total revenues are projected
to decrease slightly as a percentage of GDP, in line with the
objective of reducing the fiscal burden, while total expenditure net of interest payments is expected to remain broadly
unchanged as a percentage of GDP. However, some re–balancing in favour of capital expenditure is expected. As far
as 2000 is concerned, a no policy–change scenario is assumed, which does not take into account the corrective
measures announced but not specified in the Stability programme. Nonetheless, the deficit is assumed to decrease
further to 2.1% of GDP, mainly as a a result of lower interest payments. The debt ratio is expected to continue to

decline slightly over the forecast period, to reach 112.6% of
GDP in the year 2000.
Luxembourg
According to initial estimates, real GDP grew by 5.7% in
1998 as compared with 3.7% in 1997. This strong growth
was driven by particularly buoyant private consumption
(up 3.8%, as against 2.8% the previous year), by investment
and by exports, which dipped only very slightly in comparison with the previous year. The main engine of growth was
market services, where value added is thought to have
grown by nearly 5.3% (6.7% in financial services), but industry did not mark time either, with 3.7% growth, although
metal processing suffered a very marked slowdown in the
course of the year. The construction industry also performed well (up 5.4%). This very strong growth brought
about a sharp rise in employment (4.4%). Most of the jobs
created (two thirds in 1998, as against an average of nearly
75% in previous years) were taken up by frontier workers,
the number of whom rose by over 10%. However, the
growth in jobs held by residents, at nearly 2%, was much
higher than in previous years. The result has been a fall in
unemployment, for the first time since the end of the 1980s.
Along with neighbouring countries, inflation was particularly
low, with the consumer price index creeping up by a mere 1%
for the year as a whole, as compared with 1.4% in 1997.
As in most other Member States, growth is expected to decelerate quite appreciably in Luxembourg in 1999 under the
impact of the deteriorating international climate, falling to
around 3¼%. The forecast is for the growth in exports to
slow sharply, particularly exports of goods, which should
grow by just under 4%.
Investment is also expected to increase much more slowly
than last year, a trend which would, however, hold back the
growth of imports. Growth should pick up again in the
year 2000 as exports and, to a lesser extent, investment
stage a recovery. Employment will follow this overall
trend: it should grow more slowly this year, albeit still at
around 2%, far outstripping the European average. Employment growth should pick up again in 2000 to around
3%. Unemployment could level off in absolute terms and
even decline slightly
In 1998 the public finance situation remained particularly
sound, with general government recording as in previous
years a substantial surplus (some 2.1% of GDP). Public
debt rose slightly but remained at a very low level (6.7% of

GDP, as against 6.4% in 1997). The persistence of fairly
brisk growth in 1999 and 2000 should enable the public
authorities to continue to maintain a particularly favourable
financial situation.
Netherlands
Dutch gross domestic product grew by 3.7% in real terms in
1998, the highest rate of the decade. Even more than in the
preceding years, growth was driven by domestic demand
and in particular by private consumption, which proved to
be extremely buoyant, growing by almost 4.4% in real
terms, the highest figure since 1976. The main determinants of such buoyancy were, as in the preceding years, the
rapid increase in employment, the large reduction in taxes
and social contributions achieved during the last parliament, and probably the improvement in the asset situation
of households, linked to the sharp rise in the stock exchange
and house prices. In addition, wage increases accelerated
appreciably, and since mid–1997 are again running at more
than an annualised 3%. However, investment grew by only
4% compared with 6.8% in 1997. Imports, reflecting the
buoyancy of domestic demand, increased significantly
while exports suffered from the deterioration in the international environment, and slowed markedly over the year.
Growth will probably not exceed 2¼% in 1999 since exports are not likely to grow by more than 4%. Similarly, investment should increase by a bare 1¼%, reflecting the deterioration in enterprises confidence. Private consumption
will continue to underpin growth, as a result of the same
factors which have contributed to its buoyancy over recent
years. Real GDP growth is likely to pick up speed again in
2000 as a result in particular to a recovery of exports; real
GDP growth could thus reach 2¾%.

Inflation is unlikely to accelerate significantly over the
forecast period, at between 1½% and 2%, higher than the
figures for the neighbouring countries.
As in the preceding years the strong growth in 1998 was reflected in a rapid increase in employment, a full–time
equivalent of almost 2.5%. Unemployment therefore went
on falling, from 6.3% of the labour force in 1996 to 4.0% in
1998. The slowdown in activity in 1999 will be reflected in
the lower growth of employment, some 1¼%. Unemployment is therefore likely to go on falling, but at a slower pace.
In 2000 employment can be expected to start rising and unemployment to start coming down faster again.

In 1998, despite the buoyancy of the economy, which was
reflected in substantially higher tax revenues, the general
government deficit remained stable at 0.9% of GDP, as in
1997; public debt continued to decline, from 71.2% of GDP
to 67.7%. The economic slowdown is likely to be reflected
in 1999 by a deterioration in the public deficit, which is estimated to rise to 1.6% of GDP, before coming down again to
around 1.3% next year, in response to the pick–up in
growth. The fall in the debt ratio is likely to continue at a
slower pace and it should come down to 67% of GDP this
year and 65.5% in 2000.
Austria
Following output growth of more than 3% in 1998, economic activity in Austria is expected to increase less strongly
in 1999 under the influence of slowing growth in the economies of main trading partners, in particular Germany. The
observed deterioration of business confidence and of other
short–term indicators such as industrial production and
merchandise exports are clear evidence of a slowdown in
the Austrian economy during the winter half–year 1998/99.
In accordance with the assumed gradual improvement in
the international environment, output growth should, however, regain momentum in the second half of 1999. Annual
growth for 2000 is thus estimated at some 2¾ %.

(a) Annual percentage change, (b) Harmonised index of consumer prices,
(c) % of labour force, (d) % of GDP.

Domestic demand is expected to remain robust throughout
the forecast period. Supply side conditions – in particular
unit labour costs and the user cost of capital – will, in general, remain favourable, bolstering private investment. Private consumption should continue to be strong – despite a
further increase in the households saving ratio from its historically low level in 1997 – underpinned by higher employment and accelerating wage increases. The contribution of net exports to GDP growth, which was one of the
main driving forces during the upswing in 1997/98 will,
under the assumed international economic scenario, turn
negative in 1999 and reverse in 2000.
The trade balance will continue to improve in 1999 with the
deterioration in volume terms being more than offset by
gains in the terms of trade. This, in conjunction with a
marked recovery of tourism net income should contribute
to a further improvement in the current account from the
rather high deficit of around 2% of GDP witnessed in the
recent past.
As elsewhere in Europe, thanks also to low import prices,
there are no inflationary pressures in Austria at present.
However, in view of an acceleration in pay rises and the

– 20 –

closing of the output gap consumer prices are expected to
edge up from 1999 onwards. Mainly due to relatively high
productivity increases, unit labour costs will rise only moderately. The significant improvement in relative unit labour
costs between 1996 and 1998 will thus be largely safeguarded during the forecast period.
In line with the relatively favourable outlook for growth,
employment is expected to increase, although somewhat
less than in 1998. The forecast assumes that the recent increase in the labour force participation rate, which has been
partially due to policy measures – such as a de facto
shortening of parental leave – will level off during the projection period. As a consequence, and in contrast to previous years, during the forecast period employment gains
should be more directly translated into a decline in the unemployment rate.
Consolidation of government finances paused in 1998, but
is expected to resume in 1999/2000 with a gentle decrease
in the government deficit for both years. This forecast incorporates the assumption that recent changes in family assistance will burden government finances by 0.2% of GDP
in 1999 and by 0.4% of GDP in 2000. The reform of family
assistance will be part and parcel of a more general tax reform that will take effect in 2000. The additional measures,
which at the time when the forecast was prepared were not
known in detail and have thus not been incorporated, are
supposed to provide a net tax relief of the order ½ of a percent of GDP. Unless compensated by expenditure savings
this would imply a significant increase in the budget deficit
in 2000.
Portugal
Following the acceleration of economic activity in 1997
and 1998, a slowdown in GDP growth seems likely in 1999.
The main factors behind this development are the abating of
the effects of Expo98 and a decline in business confidence
associated with the less favourable international environment. These dampening effects will, however, be partially
offset by the impact of lower interest rates. As a result, a
weaker contribution of domestic demand and less buoyant
export growth could restrain GDP growth to somewhat
above 3%. A slight rebound is expected in 2000 when a recovery of external demand will lead to a less negative contribution from the external balance to GDP growth.
Due to the pick–up of the economy and according to the revised employment survey, improvements in the labour
market were significant in 1998. Employment increased by
2.5% and the unemployment rate decreased to an annual
average of 5.0%. Employment gains were particularly
strong in sectors with low productivity increases such as
public and private services. A slight decrease in the unemployment rate is forecast both in 1999 and 2000 and, as a consequence, the labour market may become increasingly tight.
Private consumption is forecast to grow at a steady albeit decelerating rate in 1999 and 2000 supported by a sustained increase in real disposable income, a continued good labour
market situation and lower interest rates. Investment should
decelerate somewhat in 1999 but should remain high throughout the forecast period. Construction investment is even ex-

pected to accelerate slightly but equipment investment could
decelerate due to a slowdown of machinery investment after
the marked increase during the previous four years. Thanks to
high productivity gains in the tradables sector the increase in
unit labour costs in this sector will remain moderate allowing
exports to rise faster than market growth. The current account
deficit is foreseen to increase slightly to 2½% of GDP in 1999
and above 3% of GDP in 2000.

Headline inflation accelerated in 1998, due particularly to
some special factors like the increase in some food prices
and strong demand of some goods and services owing to the
Expo98. In the forecast period the decrease of import prices
and the slowdown of economic activity are likely to
dampen inflationary pressures but this could be counteracted by wage pressures. The abating of the special factors
prevailing in 1998 should nevertheless lead to a deceleration of inflation in both 1999 and 2000.
In 1998, the general government deficit decreased slightly
to 2.3% of GDP. Owing also to asset–related measures, notably privatisation, the debt ratio came down by almost 4
percentage points to some 58% of GDP. The general government deficit in 1999 is expected to decline to 2.0% of
GDP, mainly as a result of decreasing interest payments
and high output growth, and a further decrease is foreseen
in 2000. Similarly, the government debt ratio is expected to
continue its downward trend in both 1999 and 2000.
Finland
In 1998, GDP rose by an estimated 5.3% (ESA79). Booming private consumption gave a strong boost to GDP
growth. Domestic demand accounted for most of overall
growth. The development of Finnish economy became
greatly polarised since the second half of 1998 as industrial
output and net exports decelerated sharply whereas domestic demand remained strong.
The structure of exports also changed markedly, with exports of electronics and especially telecommunications
equipment growing rapidly compared to deceleration in almost all other sectors.
The weakened outlook in export markets is expected to lead
to a deceleration in economic growth in 1999. The positive
development of high–technology exports are expected to
partially offset the negative impact of the external sector.
The polarisation of economic development, now led by domestic demand, is expected to continue in 1999. Households’ confidence has remained at a high level. Private consumption is estimated to have risen by 5% in 1998.

– 21 –

Consumers have financed the increases in consumption by
borrowing and reduced savings. However, for 1999 private
consumption is expected to decelerate, because of lower
wage growth and because the sharp fall in the saving ratio
which occurred in 1998 is unlikely to be repeated. Growth of
public consumption, on the other hand, has remained subdued.

Good business profitability and the financial position of
firms set positive preconditions for investment. Construction activity is expected to remain robust in the forecasting
period albeit less buoyant than in 1998.
Declining import prices contributed to a deceleration of
consumer price inflation in the course of 1998, leading to an
average of 1.4 %. The average inflation rate is expected to
fall further in the forecasting period.
The rate of employment creation decelerated somewhat in
1998. Most new jobs are being created in the private services sector. The unemployment rate, which averaged
12.7% in 1997, declined to 11.4 % in 1998.
Employment growth is expected to decelerate despite the
shifting focus in GDP growth from the capital–intensive
export industry to the more labour–intensive construction
and services sectors.
The general government surplus is expected to be close to
2.5% of GDP in the forecasting period. Government consumption is assumed to remain subdued, due to the savings
measures.
Sweden
GDP growth is estimated to have been somewhat above
trend, at 2.9%, in 1998. It was sustained totally by domestic
demand. Despite strong growth, the economy was generally thought to have been operating below potential
throughout 1998 and inflationary pressures were weak.
Moreover, the international economic environment and,
consequently, the prospects for world growth worsened. It
was this overall environment that resulted in successive
cuts in the repo rate to 3.15% in February 1999 from 4.35%
at the start of 1998. The indications are that GDP growth in
1999 will be lower than in 1998 at 2.2%. Growth in 2000
should be above trend and is projected to accelerate to 2.7%.
Private consumption in 1999 is expected to grow well, at
2.7%. It will be supported by several factors. Real wages
should rise moderately. Employment is forecast to grow

though at reduced rates from 1998. A temporary tax cut
will augment disposable income. Consumer confidence
with respect to consumers’ own finances is currently high.
That still implies a significant rise in the saving ratio though
to perhaps a more normal level. In 2000 private consumption
growth, at 2.9%, is projected to be a little higher than in 1999.
Fixed investment in 1999 should grow well and this will result from strong construction investment supported by
strong rises in new dwellings built and by retail and wholesale construction. Equipment investment will grow more
slowly. Investment growth is expected to accelerate in
2000. Construction investment growth will be strong as in
1999 and, in addition, equipment investment should grow
more rapidly as the prospects for industry improve.
Strong growth of consumption and investment in 1999 will
be partly offset by a negative contribution from stock–
building.
Export growth will slow in 1999 to a little below the growth
in Sweden’s markets but import growth should also remained subdued as a result of lower stockbuilding and
slower growth of equipment investment Export growth will
recover in 2000 as export markets grow more rapidly but,
offsetting this, imports are expected to grow strongly due to
stronger growth in domestic demand.
Despite a temporary tax cut in 1999, the effects of restrained expenditure and falling interest costs on the debt
should result in a surplus of 0.25% of GDP in the government finances. The surplus is expected to rise to 1.8% of
GDP in 2000 as economic growth accelerates, interest payments fall further and the temporary tax cut in 1999 is reversed. Debt relative to GDP is expected to fall to 65% at the
end of 2000.
Output is expected to remain below or close to potential
over the next two years. Inflationary pressures will therefore remain weak. CPI inflation is expected to rise, in part
because the recent falls in interest rates fall out of the calculation, but inflation should remain below 1% and that is
also true on an HICP basis.
United Kingdom
GDP grew by 2.3% in 1998 and growth slowed down in the
second half of the year.With prospects of slower growth and
little sign of current and future threats to inflation, the Bank
of England’s Monetary Policy Committee reduced the repo
rate from 7½% last October to 5½% in February.

The signs are that economic growth appeared weak, if not
flat, around the turn of the year but there are encouraging
signs. Manufacturing output rose a little in January. Industrial surveys do not reveal buoyancy but they do suggest an
improvement in prospects. Consumer confidence is rising.
Unemployment remains low. However, export volumes
are flat.
GDP is not expected to fall but it will remain weak in the
first half of 1999. This is due to the lagged effect of sterling’s strength as well as continued low growth in the UK’s
export markets. Growth is expected to recover to a little
under trend – estimated to be around 2¼ to 2½% a year – in
the second half of the year as the positive effects of improved monetary conditions are felt and the depressing effects of sterling’s strength on net exports fades. GDP
growth is projected to average 1.1% in 1999. Growth
should pick up in the first half of 2000 as the full effects of
the improved monetary policy conditions are felt and the
negative effects of sterling’s appreciation finally fade away.
GDP growth in 2000 is projected at 2.3%.
Consumers’ expenditure is projected to grow moderately,
by 2.2%, in 1999. This is due to modest real rises in wages,
continuing employment growth albeit small, and rises in
(net) interest income as cuts in short term interest rates reduce the cost of servicing mortgage debt. Nevertheless the
saving ratio is forecast to rise in 1999 to a more normal level
from 1998’s exceptionally low figure. Consumers’ ex-

penditure should also continue to grow moderately in 2000
for similar reasons.
Fixed investment is expected to grow in 1999 but at a reduced rate from 1998. Construction investment should be
supported by dwellings investment and by the government’s plans to increase its share of investment in GDP.
However, equipment investment growth will weaken as
subdued profits restrain expenditure. Growth of fixed investment should pick up in 2000 as equipment investment
recovers a little. Government investment will continue to
grow strongly. Growth in consumption and fixed investment will be partly offset by a decline in stockbuilding in
1999 following a rapid build–up in 1998. In 2000 this will
not be a drag on growth.
Growth of exports of goods and services is expected to revive during the course of 1999 as the effects of sterling’s
past strength disappears, but net exports in 1999 as a whole
are forecast to decline as growth in UK markets falls and
import growth remains strong. In 2000, the UK’s export
markets, and hence exports, will grow more strongly as the
world outlook improves.
Despite weak growth in 1999, employment is expected to
grow slightly though the unemployment rate is expected to
edge up gradually. The public finances are projected to be
close to balance in 1999 following 1998’s surplus. The
move from surplus, in part, results from the effects of faster
growth in planned expenditure and falls in revenue from
company taxes. The effects of the 1999 budget are expected
to be broadly neutral in 1999 and 2000. The public finances
are expected to remain close to balance in 2000 when the
debt to GDP ratio is forecast to fall to 46%.
During 1999 and 2000, inflationary pressures should remain subdued as output moves, initially, below productive
potential. Unit labour cost growth is expected to fall a little
despite the introduction of a minimum wage, as labour
market pressures fall. The government’s 2½% target for
RPIX inflation is projected to be met in 1999 and 2000 and
HICP inflation should be around 1½%.
