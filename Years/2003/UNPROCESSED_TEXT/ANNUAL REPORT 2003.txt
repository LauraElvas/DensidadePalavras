Since 1998 the ECB has organised a series of exhibitions entitled ﬁContemporary art from the
Member States of the European Unionﬂ. Each exhibition aims to give ECB staff and visitors an
insight into the art scene of a particular EU country. Contemporary art has been chosen since it
reflects the period when Monetary Union became reality.Some of the artworks are purchased for the ECB™s art collection, which is to be expanded. Theeight pages which separate the chapters of this Annual Report show a selection of works fromthis collection.FOREWORD
10ECBAnnualReport
2003For most of last year, Wim Duisenberg was at thehelm of the ECB and I wish to pay tribute to him.Under his presidency, the EMI, the ECB and theNCBs successfully dealt with all the challenges
they had to meet: the changeover of all capital
markets and cashless transactions to the euro on
4 January 1999, the century date change and
the cash changeover on 1 January 2002. TheEurosystem was perceived as a highly crediblecentral bank with a reliable policy and as a good
guardian of the currency, preserving price
stability and confidence in the euro. It is this
legacy of an efficient steering of the united
European monetary team that the other membersof the Executive Board of the ECB and I are keento preserve and reinforce in the years to come.***In December 2002 the Governing Council of theECB announced its decision to conduct acomprehensive evaluation of its monetary
policy strategy in the first half of 2003. Since
the inception of the ECB, the monetary policy
strategy has provided a robust basis for internal
decision-making and a consistent frameworkfor external communication, thereby fosteringthe ECB™s accountability. Indeed, there isevidence that since 1999 long-term inflation
expectations Œ which provide a measure of the

central bank™s credibility Œ have remained
consistent with the ECB™s definition of pricestability. Less uncertainty about future inflationhas helped to reduce the risk premia in interest
rates, and thus real financing costs. It was only
natural that, after more than four years of
experience, the Governing Council wanted to
look back and reflect in a systematic way on theexperience gained and the comments made byexternal observers.On 8 May 2003 the Governing Councilannounced the results of its evaluation of the
strategy. It confirmed the definition of pricestability that had been announced in October1998 as a year-on-year increase of below 2% in
the HICP for the euro area. At the same time,
the Governing Council clarified that, in the
pursuit of price stability within the definition, it
aims to keep inflation rates below, but close to,
2% over the medium term. The GoverningCouncil also confirmed that its monetary policydecisions would continue to be based on a
comprehensive analysis of the risks to price
stability, comprising an economic analysis and
a monetary analysis. The Governing Council
emphasised that, in seeking to make a unifiedjudgement of the risks to price stability, itwould continue to cross-check the information
gained from the thorough economic analysis
with the monetary analysis in a medium and
long-term perspective. To underscore the
longer-term nature of the reference value formonetary growth, the Governing Councildecided to no longer review the monetary
reference value on an annual basis. With its
confirmation and clarification of the main
elements of its stability-oriented monetary
policy concept, the Governing Council hasfurther improved the understanding of theECB™s strategy both in Europe and throughout
the world.***11ECBAnnualReport
2003In the first half of 2003 economic activity wasvery weak in the wake both of the escalation of
geopolitical tensions related to the situation in
Iraq and of the uncertainty prevailing in
financial markets. It was only as from thesummer of 2003 that economic confidence in theeuro area gradually improved and signs of
global economic recovery strengthened.
Overall, real GDP growth in the euro area was
0.4% in 2003, after 0.9% in 2002. Over recent
months economic activity in the euro area hasincreased. The growth of euro area exports hasremained robust as a consequence of the
dynamic expansion of the world economy. In
addition, the conditions for a recovery in
domestic demand are in place, not least as a
consequence of the low level of interest ratesand the generally favourable financingconditions. The disappointing performance of
real GDP growth over recent years illustrates
the euro area economy™s lack of flexibility and
resulting vulnerability to external shocks.
While some progress has been made in this
respect, as must be acknowledged andwelcomed, continued and very substantialefforts are still needed to implement the
structural reforms that will increase
employment growth and labour participation,
raise productivity and enhance the potential for
growth in the euro area. In addition, against thebackground of demographic developments,corrective action is needed to ensure that health
care and pension systems are sustainable in the
long run.In 2003 annual inflation, as measured by theHICP, declined to 2.1% (from 2.3% in 2002).The persistence of inflation rates above 2% was
mainly caused by unexpected increases in some
volatile components of the HICP (such as oil
and food prices in the second half of 2003), but
increases in indirect taxes and administeredprices in the course of 2003 also had someimpact. In a medium-term perspective,
inflationary pressures in 2003 had been
expected to develop in line with price stability.The picture of a favourable outlook for pricestability was not jeopardised by the continuedstrong monetary growth in 2003. Indeed, part ofthis strength was attributed to the high level of
economic and financial market uncertainty
prevailing during the first half of 2003, which
prompted portfolio shifts into safer, short-termliquid assets included in M3. The accumulationof excess liquidity was therefore not regarded
as alarming; however, vigilance is required in
case this high level of liquidity continues to be
observed when the recovery picks up pace.In view of the moderation of inflationarypressures in the first half of 2003, the key ECB
interest rates were reduced by 25 basis points in
March 2003, and by 50 basis points in June. As
a consequence, the minimum bid rate on the
main refinancing operations reached thehistorically low level of 2.0%. These decisionswere in line with the aim of maintaining
inflation rates below but close to 2% over the
medium term. The very low levels of interest
rates also provided some counterweight to the
various factors that were having an adverse
effect on economic activity. In the second halfof 2003 the key ECB interest rates were leftunchanged, as the stance of monetary policy
was considered appropriate to preserve price
stability over the medium term.As regards fiscal policies, most Member Statesfailed to meet the targets set out in the stabilityprogrammes that had been submitted at the end
of 2002 and the beginning of 2003. The average
fiscal deficit for the euro area increased from
2.3% of GDP in 2002 to 2.7% of GDP in 2003.
Moreover, the fiscal situation remained asource of concern in countries that had alreadyrecorded significant imbalances in 2002. On
25 November the ECOFIN Council decided
not to act on the basis of the Commission
recommendations regarding Germany and
France, and agreed to hold the excessive deficitprocedures for these countries in abeyance. Thetwo countries concerned committed themselves
to correcting their excessive deficits as soon as
possible and by 2005 at the latest, while the
Council indicated that it stood ready to take a
decision under Article 104 (9) of the Treatyestablishing the European Community Œ thereby12ECBAnnualReport
2003triggering the excessive deficit procedure againŒ if these two countries should fail to meet their
commitments. Other countries that still face
fiscal imbalances likewise need to make
progress towards achieving budgetary positionsclose to balance or in surplus over the mediumterm.It is crucial that confidence in the solidity bothof public finances and of the economic
and institutional underpinnings of EMU bemaintained. In the view of the GoverningCouncil, all parties involved need to live up to
their responsibilities and commitments.
Looking ahead, it is essential that fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms take root.
This should also have positive effects in theshort term, as it may enhance public confidencein the credibility of the rules and long-term
fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, reforms of
expenditure and taxation, and a reprioritisation
towards productive expenditure, would foster
potential output growth.***On 1 May 2004 ten further countries will be
joining the EU, and ten new central banks will
become members of the ESCB. This major
political and economic event, which istaking place only some 14 years after the fallof the Berlin Wall and 12 years after
the signing of the Maastricht Treaty,
demonstrates how fast history is moving. In
their field of competence, the ECB and the
NCBs, in cooperation with the central banks ofthe acceding countries, have carried out atremendous amount of preparatory work to
ensure a smooth integration of the acceding
country central banks (ACCBs) into the ESCB.
In order to cope with this challenge, the ECB
has recruited and is continuing to recruit newstaff, notably experts from the accedingcountries who will contribute Œ through their
knowledge and specific background Œ to the
efficiency and dynamism of the ECB.
Moreover, the governors of the ACCBs have
been invited to participate in the meetings of theGeneral Council as observers since June 2003,while experts from their institutions have beenparticipating with the same status in ESCB
committees since April 2003.The accession of ten new countries is a majorhistorical and institutional event for the EU,which induced the Europeans to prepare a new
constitutional design through the work of the
Convention on the future of Europe. The ECB
followed the work of the Convention and the
intergovernmental conference very closely andcontributed to their deliberations on issues ofrelevance to the tasks and mandate of the ECB
and the ESCB. The Governing Council of the
ECB has welcomed the draft Treaty establishing
a Constitution for Europe (draft Constitution)
in general, on the understanding that it wouldnot entail any changes to the substance of thetasks, mandate, status and legal regime of
the ECB and the ESCB. The ECB™s main
request was to introduce a reference to ﬁnon-
inflationary growthﬂ or ﬁprice stabilityﬂ in
Article I-3 (3) on the EU™s objectives. Such a
reference of proper prominence was lacking inthe text of the Convention. The ECB alsosuggested, in particular, recognising the
independence of the NCBs in Article I-29,
introducing a reference to the widely recognised
term ﬁEurosystemﬂ in the draft Constitution
and adding an explicit reference to theresponsibilities of the ESCB in Article III-90on how the euro™s place in the international
monetary system should be ensured.***Turning to the organisation and functioning of
the ECB, 2003 was a very challenging year for
the institution. At the end of the year the annual
accounts of the ECB showed a net loss of
€477 million. This loss, which is mainly due towrite-downs of the euro value of the ECB™sholdings of US dollar-denominated assets,arises after account has been taken of all income
earned by the ECB, including income on euro
banknotes in circulation, and of the release of
provisions made in previous years against
exchange and interest rate risks, amounting to€2.6 billion. The depreciation of the US dollar13ECBAnnualReport
2003Frankfurt am Main, March 2004Jean-Claude Trichetin the course of 2003 has resulted in substantialunrealised losses that are treated Œ in
accordance with the principle of prudence Œ as
realised losses and entered in the profit and loss
account, whereas unrealised gains are posted torevaluation accounts. Furthermore, thehistorically low levels of interest rates
prevailing in 2003, and their evolution in
respect of both the ECB™s main reserve
currencies and the euro, have also led to a
reduction of its interest income, includingincome on the counterpart assets to banknotesin circulation.At the end of 2003 the number of staffemployed by the ECB was 1,217, compared
with 1,109 at the end of 2002. As from1 January 2003 all vacant positions wereopened to nationals of acceding countries, and
the ECB successfully launched recruitment
campaigns aimed specifically at recruiting such
nationals as translators, lawyer-linguists and
legal counsels. 39 staff members from acceding
countries are currently employed on contractsof more than one year™s duration.Since 1998 the ECB has grown steadily and thenumber of staff members has risen
substantially, creating a need to permanently
improve the functioning of the internalorganisation. In this context, the ExecutiveBoard decided to launch a number of staff
surveys on the issues of corporate principles,
internal communications and organisational
performance. On the basis of the survey results,
the Executive Board decided to embark on aprocess of changes in management called ﬁECBin Motionﬂ. Four project teams were established
under the guidance of a project office and the
Executive Board. In October 2003 the Executive
Board approved a number of measures, most
of which should be ready for implementation byJuly 2004. Our aim is to improve thefunctioning and efficiency of the ECB, to
enhance the management of human resources
and to reinforce central banking values such as
efficiency, impartiality, discretion and high
ethical standards among all staff. Thefundamental spirit of ECB in Motion is to applymore fully, more comprehensively and moreefficiently the concept of the team to the
different aspects of the functioning of the ECB,
whether through a better empowerment of staff,
through more direct rewards for performance ofstaff or through reinforcement of an open andcooperative environment.ArtistHans VandekerckhoveTitleLandschappeling, 2000MaterialOil on canvasFormat200 × 160 cmCHAPTER 1ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSAND

20031.1EVALUATION OF THE ECB™S MONETARY
POLICY STRATEGY
After more than four years of conducting
monetary policy for the euro area, theGoverning Council of the ECB undertook athorough evaluation of the ECB™s monetary
policy strategy in the first half of 2003 in order
to take stock of the experience accumulated thus
far. This evaluation took into account the public
debate concerning the appropriate design ofmonetary policy and the results of a number of
technical studies prepared by Eurosystem staff
as background material for the evaluation
exercise (see Box 1). On 8 May 2003 the
Governing Council announced the outcome of
its evaluation. That evaluation related to boththe quantification of the price stability objectiveof the ECB and the framework for analysing the
risks to price stability.1THE OBJECTIVE OF PRICE STABILITY
In October 1998 the Governing Council of the

ECB announced a quantitative definition of itsprice stability objective. That objective wasdefined as ﬁa year-on-year increase in the

Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)

for the euro area of below 2%ﬂ. By referring to
an increase in the HICP of below 2%, the
definition of price stability made it clear that
both inflation and deflation are incompatiblewith price stability. The definition of price
stability did not specify an explicit lower bound
for inflation rates, reflecting uncertainty
surrounding the size of a potential measurement

bias in the HICP and its possible variation overtime. The upper bound was set at a level clearlyabove zero in order to incorporate in the
definition a safety margin to guard against the
risks of deflation. At the same time, the upper
bound of 2% was considered to be low enough

for the benefits of price stability to be reaped.The Governing Council also specified thatﬁprice stability is to be maintained over the
medium termﬂ. This reflected the recognition
that monetary policy is not suited to controlling
prices or fine-tuning economic developmentsover short periods of time.1MONETARY POLICY IN THE EURO AREA
In its announcement of 8 May 2003, theGoverning Council confirmed its definition of
price stability. At the same time, it made clear
that, within that definition, it aims to maintain
the inflation rate below but close to 2% over themedium term.In its quantification of the price stabilityobjective, the Governing Council again
explicitly took into consideration both the costs
of inflation and the possible arguments fortolerating moderate positive inflation.The costs associated with inflation are wellunderstood. Recent studies suggest that they
may actually be higher than previously thought,
even in the case of moderate rates of inflation.In particular, inflation distorts the signallingfunction of relative price movements and

diverts resources away from productive uses
towards activities directed at protecting
investors against inflation. Furthermore,
inflation amplifies the distortionary effects of
taxation and may increase uncertainty andthus risk premia, thereby hampering theaccumulation of capital in the economy. From a
redistributional point of view, inflation
increases inequality, as it penalises the weakest
groups in society, which are less equipped to
protect themselves against the costs ofinflation. On these grounds, barring furtherconsiderations, there would seem to be a strong
case for literal price stability.However, despite the significant costs ofinflation, a number of considerations alsosuggest that maintaining a moderate positiverate of inflation would be desirable. The first
argument concerns the presence of a zero lower
bound for nominal interest rates and the risks of
deflation. The lower bound problem stems from
the fact that a central bank cannot force nominalinterest rates to levels below zero. Any attemptto do so would probably fail, as the public
would prefer to hold cash Œ which yields a zero
nominal return Œ rather than lend or hold1See also the article entitled ﬁThe outcome of the ECB™s evaluation
of its monetary policy strategyﬂ in the June 2003 issue of the ECB™s

Monthly Bulletin.17ECBAnnualReport
2003deposits at a negative rate. In these conditions, aprotracted period of deflation caused by a
sequence of negative aggregate demand shocks
may limit the central bank™s ability to reduce
real interest rates in order to stimulate demandand counteract deflationary pressures.Although alternative policy actions are
available even when the interest rate is at zero, it
is prudent to maintain a safety margin by aiming
at a positive, but low, rate of inflation rather
than at zero inflation.The second argument for maintaining amoderate positive rate of inflation concerns the
possible presence of a measurement bias in the

price index, caused, for example, by a lack of
adequate adjustment for changes in quality.This would mean that aiming at a measuredinflation rate of zero could actually lead to
declining prices. Although the size of the
measurement bias in the euro area HICP is
uncertain, available studies indicate that it is
likely to be limited.The third argument in favour of aiming for low
positive inflation rates concerns the fact that a
positive rate of change in the price level may
have a beneficial effect in facilitating the real
adjustment of the economy to various shocks in
the presence of downward nominal rigidities.These rigidities may stem from producers™ andworkers™ resistance to nominal reductions

in prices and wages. While the practical
importance of downward nominal rigidities is

highly uncertain and the empirical evidence is
not conclusive, particularly for the euro area, itis crucial that structural reforms seek to
increase the flexibility of product and labour
markets.An additional consideration that might beput forward in favour of maintaining a lowpositive inflation rate in the medium termconcerns processes of real convergence among
heterogeneous regions in a currency union. If
convergence across regions in terms of income
and productivity levels is incomplete, structural

inflation differentials may arise betweenregions to allow price (and income) levels in the
less developed areas to catch up with those inthe more mature economies within the union. In
these circumstances, it has been argued that
monetary policy should aim at a union-wide
inflation rate high enough to prevent regionswith lower inflation rates from facing thesignificant costs associated with downward
nominal rigidities or entering protracted periods
of declining prices. While these considerations
are theoretically sound, in practice they can be
accommodated by a strategy that aims tomaintain the inflation rate below but close to 2%
over the medium term, as clarified by the
Governing Council on 8 May. In fact, it should

be noted that the present degree of convergence
in the euro area is relatively high and does not
seem to pose a significant problem at the currentjuncture. In view of the accession process, the
overall relevance of this effect is also likely to

remain limited in the future, given the small
weight of the acceding countries™ economies in
an enlarged euro area. In addition, acceding
countries will have to fulfil the convergence
criteria in order to adopt the euro. This requiresthem to demonstrate that they have convergedsufficiently and in a sustainable way and
to meet the conditions necessary to sustain a
low inflation environment prior to the adoption
of the euro.Regarding the index to be used for assessingwhether price stability has been achieved, the
Governing Council concluded that headline
HICP remains appropriate. It most closely
approximates Œ in a harmonised fashion across
the countries of the euro area Œ the changes overtime in the price of a representative basket ofconsumer goods. It is a credible and reliable
statistic that helps to communicate, in a
transparent manner, the ECB™s commitment to
full and effective protection against reductions

in the purchasing power of money.It is sometimes argued that central banks shoulduse measures of ﬁcoreﬂ or ﬁunderlyingﬂ
inflation to define their primary objective.
These measures provide useful tools for
analysis, as they remove the more volatilecomponents and/or temporary factors from18ECBAnnualReport
2003headline inflation with a view to uncoveringmore fundamental trends in price movements.However, choosing a measure of underlying
inflation to define price stability would involve
significant drawbacks from the point of view of
monetary policy, particularly regarding the loss

of transparency. Furthermore, it would berather arbitrary, as there is no singleuncontroversial method for determining such
measures. In any case, by defining the price
stability objective in terms of headline inflation,
the ECB is in no way paying excessive attention
to short-term price developments in itsmonetary policy deliberations. The medium-term orientation of the ECB™s monetary policy

strategy ensures that the Governing Council
duly discounts any short-term price volatility
when taking decisions.In conclusion, the Governing Council™s
decision of 8 May 2003 reflects the positive
experience with the quantification of the ECB™s

price stability objective and ensures full
continuity with the past conduct of its monetary
policy. As Chart 1 shows, longer-term inflationexpectations in the euro area have been firmly
anchored at levels in line with the definition of
price stability since January 1999, remaining
within a range between 1.7% and 1.9%. This is

a remarkable result given the considerable
adverse price shocks that have hit the euro area.

This firm anchoring of inflation expectations
allows the medium-term inflationary effect ofadverse price shocks to be contained, thusavoiding possibly strong monetary policy
reactions to such shocks, which could in turn

have a negative effect on the variability of

output.THE ANALYSIS OF RISKS TO PRICE STABILITY
In October 1998 the Governing Council of the
ECB announced that its approach to organising,
evaluating and cross-checking the information
relevant for assessing the risks to price stability
would be based on two analytical perspectives,which subsequently came to be known as theﬁtwo pillarsﬂ of the ECB™s monetary policy
strategy. This framework is designed to ensure
that no policy-relevant information is neglected
in the formation of a comprehensive assessment
of the outlook for price stability. Within one ofthe two pillars, which gives a prominent role toChart 1 Longer-term inflation expectations(annual percentage changes)Sources: Eurostat, Consensus Economics Forecasts, Survey of Professional Forecasters and ECB calculations.1) Longer-term inflation expectations are market inflation expectations at a horizon of six to ten years.

2003money, a reference value for the growth rate ofa broad monetary aggregate consistent with the
ECB™s price stability objective has been
specified.On 8 May 2003 the Governing Council
announced that its monetary policy decisions
would continue to be based on a comprehensive

analysis of the risks to price stability made on
the basis of the two pillars. The two pillars
would henceforth be referred to as ﬁeconomicanalysisﬂ and ﬁmonetary analysisﬂ. TheGoverning Council stated that, over time, both
forms of analysis had been deepened and
extended as the availability of euro area data
had increased and technical tools had improved,

and would continue to be developed in thefuture.The Governing Council also clarified the way inwhich it integrates the indications stemming

from these two complementary types of analysis
as it seeks to come to an overall judgement
on the risks to price stability. In particular,the Governing Council indicated that themonetary analysis serves mainly as a means
of cross-checking, from a medium to long-
term perspective, the short to medium-term

indications derived from the economic analysis.
The economic analysis focuses mainly on the
assessment of current economic and financial
developments and the implied short to medium-
term risks to price stability from the perspective

of the interplay between supply and demand in
goods, services and factor markets at thosehorizons. In this respect, due attention is paid tothe need to identify the nature of shocks hitting
the economy, their effects on cost and pricing

behaviour and the short to medium-term
prospects for their propagation in the economy.However, economic analysis in isolation fails to
capture the mechanisms by which monetary
factors act over extended horizons and does not
identify the longer-term trends underlying price
developments. There is therefore a need for

monetary policy to explicitly take into accountthe information contained in the medium-termtrend in money growth, which is empiricallyclosely associated with the formation of prices
at more extended horizons.The undisputed relationship between moneygrowth and inflation in the medium to long termprovides monetary policy with a firm and
reliable nominal anchor beyond the horizons
conventionally adopted when constructing
inflation forecasts on the basis of standard
macroeconomic models. In this sense, theECB™s approach constitutes a commitment toensuring that, while economic developments are
responded to as they unfold, the fundamental
factor driving prices over extended horizons Œ

the rate of money growth Œ is consistently
monitored.The ECB™s framework does not entail thepartitioning of the information set relevant for
the assessment of price prospects. Similarly, it
does not allocate indicators rigidly to the
economic analysis or the monetary analysis. On
the contrary, it exploits all complementaritiesbetween relevant information variables in aconsistent manner.In order to properly reflect the cross-checkingrole of monetary analysis in its communication
with the public, the Governing Council also
decided that the President™s IntroductoryStatement to the ECB™s monthly press

conferences would henceforth have a different

structure, which would take into account the
clarification of the ECB™s monetary policy
strategy.To underscore the longer-term nature of the
reference value for monetary growth as a
benchmark for the assessment of monetary
developments, the Governing Council decided
to no longer conduct a formal review of thereference value on an annual basis. However, italso decided to continue to assess the
conditions and assumptions underlying the
reference value and communicate any changes
to the underlying assumptions as soon as they
become necessary.20ECBAnnualReport
2003Box 1RESEARCH RELATED TO THE ECB™S MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY EVALUATION
During the winter and spring of 2003 the Governing Council of the ECB conducted anevaluation of the ECB™s monetary policy strategy. Ten background studies were prepared byEurosystem staff, partly in consultation with external co-authors. The studies focused on

technical issues which were considered relevant, such as the choice of the price index and the
format used to define price stability, the indicator properties of monetary aggregates and the

stability of euro area money demand. The technical studies were made available on the ECB™s
website immediately after the communication of the outcome of the strategy evaluation on 8 May2003. In November 2003 the ECB published a book, which brought together those studies.1Concerning the choice of price index, one of the studies concluded that the HICP continues to bea valid yardstick for prices in the euro area, but that there is still some room for improvement in
the construction of the HICP. In particular, frequent re-basing of the national indices is
important to ensure the accuracy and comparability of the HICP and to reduce substitution bias.Such bias occurs in a price index where it ignores the possibility that when prices of certainitems rise, individuals may choose to replace more expensive goods with cheaper ones while
still achieving the same level of utility.The issue of the format used to define price stability concerns the importance of announcing a
specific target, a range or a price stability objective formulated only in qualitative terms. One
study focused on this by analysing survey data on long-term inflation expectations in 15industrialised countries and found that these inflation expectations were well anchored in mostof the countries. When comparing the evidence as regards the different formats of inflation

objectives, the study concluded that the specific features of announcements have no visible
effect on the ability to anchor inflation expectations.An important topic that was analysed in two studies was the zero lower bound on nominal
interest rates and the risks of prolonged deflation or a deflationary spiral. Whereas some costsrelated to inflation are also incurred in periods of deflation, there are particularly serious
problems which are specific to deflation and which indicate that it may be desirable to maintain
a small positive inflation rate as a safety margin. Based on somewhat different theoretical
models, both studies of the zero lower bound issue concluded that the likelihood of the zero
lower bound becoming binding did not represent a qualitatively important factor where theinflation objective was set at 1% or higher.
The decision by the Governing Council in 1998 to assign a prominent role to money was takenin recognition of the fact that inflation is a monetary phenomenon in the medium to long term.
One of the background studies surveyed a large body of theoretical and empirical literature and
concluded that a systematic monitoring of monetary developments can help a central bank toidentify potentially destabilising shocks that would be difficult to detect using a real-sectormodel. Another study examined the potential for narrow money to improve forecasts of real
GDP. Contrary to the findings for the United States, this study concluded that in the euro area
M1 has better and more robust forecasting properties than yield spreads. One study conducted1Background Studies for the ECB™s Evaluation of its Monetary Policy Strategy,

2003CONCLUSIONWith its announcement of 8 May 2003 theGoverning Council confirmed and clarified the
ECB™s monetary policy strategy. The
Governing Council™s statement that it aims to
maintain inflation rates below but close to 2% is
fully consistent with the ECB™s price stabilitydefinition announced in October 1998 andreflects full continuity with the past conduct of
monetary policy. At the same time, the changes

to the presentation of the two-pillar framework,
now referred to as ﬁeconomic analysisﬂ and
ﬁmonetary analysisﬂ, should help the public to
understand more clearly the conduct ofmonetary policy.1.2KEY ECB INTEREST RATES REACHED
HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS IN 2003
The economic environment in which monetary

policy was conducted in the euro area during the
first half of 2003 was surrounded by
considerable uncertainty related to the high
degree of geopolitical tension in the Middle
East and the associated turbulence in oil prices
and financial markets. While real GDP growthstagnated in the first half of the year, prospects

for economic activity gradually brightened over
the summer following the end of the military
operations in Iraq and the normalisation in
financial market conditions. Overall, real GDPin the euro area increased by only 0.4% in 2003,
a disappointing performance considering that
the euro area had already recorded below
potential real GDP growth in both 2001 and
2002 (with annual growth rates of 1.6% and
0.9% respectively).Despite weak economic activity, annual HICPinflation slowed only very moderately, from2.3% on average in both 2001 and 2002 to 2.1%

in 2003, thus remaining slightly above the

upper limit of the ECB™s definition of price
stability. However, in 2003 the continued

subdued pace of economic activity and the
significant appreciation of the euro wereexpected to dampen inflationary pressures over
the medium term.In line with the ECB™s monetary policystrategy, the Governing Council cross-checked

the indications of risks to price stability derivedfrom the economic analysis with those from themonetary analysis. Although, partly as a result
of portfolio shifts, monetary growth remained
strong in 2003 and there was a significant
amount of excess liquidity which had built
up after mid-2001, inflationary risks were
considered to be low in view of the rather
subdued economic activity and moderate credit
growth.The Governing Council lowered the key ECBinterest rates in March and June 2003 by 25 and50 basis points respectively. These decisions,which followed a 50 basis point reduction
in December 2002, reflected the overall

assessment in the first half of the year that
medium-term inflationary pressures were

moderating. These decisions put the minimum
bid rate on the main refinancing operations atthe historically low level of 2.0% and the
interest rates on the marginal lending facility
and the deposit facility at 3.0% and 1.0%
respectively (see Chart 2). In the second half of
2003 these rates were kept unchanged, as theGoverning Council considered them to beformal tests on both the short and long-term stability of broad money demand for the euro area.It concluded that the stability of neither the long nor short-term parameters of money demand
could be rejected. Another study reviewed the question of why broad money demand has been
more stable in the euro area as a whole than in individual countries inside and outside the euro
area. Among other things, the study suggested that stability has been enhanced by aggregating
the money demand of individual euro area countries.
22ECBAnnualReport
2003compatible with the maintenance of pricestability over the medium term.
Turning to a more detailed analysis of monetarypolicy decisions in 2003, in the first few
months of the year the economic data
increasingly supported the view that economicactivity would remain subdued and evolve moreweakly than had been expected in late 2002.
Heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle
East sparked uncertainty about the economic
outlook, led to sharp rises in oil prices and
contributed to the increase in financial marketvolatility. In this environment, while the mostlikely scenario was one of a gradual increase in
real GDP growth starting in the second half

of 2003, risks were increasingly perceived
to be on the downside. The accumulated
macroeconomic imbalances in major economic
areas of the world outside the euro area addedto the uncertainty surrounding the global recovery.HICP inflation remained above 2% in early2003, as increases in oil prices and rises in
indirect taxes and administered pricesintroduced some upward price pressures. Thefact that the annual growth rates of the lessvolatile components of the HICP remainedrelatively high despite the subdued economic
activity, and the fact that nominal wage growth

remained relatively strong despite the rise in
unemployment and low productivity growth

introduced some concern as regards themedium-term outlook for price stability.Overall, however, the economic analysisindicated in early 2003 that the most likely
outcome was that inflation would finally fall
and eventually stabilise at a level below 2%over the medium term. The protracted period ofweak economic growth was increasingly seen
as a factor that would eventually limit the
potential upward risks to price stability via its
effects on wage and price-setting behaviour. In

addition, the appreciation of the euro, witnessedsince the spring of 2002, was expected todampen consumer price inflation over time.Monetary growth continued to be strong in
early 2003, partly as a result of the high degree
of economic and financial market uncertainty,which continued to give rise to portfolioChart 2 ECB interest rates and the overnight interest rate(percentages per annum; daily data)

2003shifts into short-term liquid assets included inM3 and supported precautionary savings.
Consequently, inflationary risks related to

monetary developments were considered to be
low. This assessment was supported by thecontinuing moderate rate of growth of loans tothe private sector, notably of loans to non-
financial corporations.On balance, the Governing Council expected thefactors dampening inflation over the mediumterm to prevail. Therefore, it decided on6 March 2003 to reduce the key ECB interest
rates by 25 basis points, taking the minimum
bid rate on the main refinancing operations to
2.5%.In the second quarter of 2003 it becameincreasingly clear that real economic activity
was weak and that the downside risks to the
scenario of a recovery remained. The possible
effects of the military operations in Iraq were
initially difficult to assess. Despite the
abatement of the geopolitical tensions in thecourse of the spring, it gradually becameevident that a strong recovery in confidence and
economic activity was unlikely to materialise in
the near future. Concerns about the impact of
the SARS virus also clouded the outlook for
economic growth in East Asia. In addition,
other downside risks remained, related to thepast accumulation of imbalances outside the

euro area and uncertainty about the extent of the
further adjustment still needed in the euro area
corporate sector to enhance productivity and
profitability after the protracted period of weakgrowth and the large decline in stock prices.Oil prices declined as the uncertainty related tothe outcome of the military operations in Iraq
diminished. In view of the economic situation and

the continued appreciation of the euro, there were
reasons to expect in June 2003 that annual HICPinflation would reach levels comfortably below
2% over the medium term. This overall picture for
inflation was also reflected in the June 2003
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and
in the forecasts of other international institutionsproduced in the second quarter of 2003.Cross-checking the economic analysis with themonetary analysis, the strong M3 growth
appeared increasingly to be related to the low
levels of interest rates, as indicated by the
strong growth in the most liquid components ofM3. However, as a significant part of theaccumulated excess liquidity was related to
portfolio shifts and precautionary money
demand, the overall monetary situation was
assessed as being less of a concern for medium-
term price developments, at least in a period ofsubdued economic activity.Against this background, the GoverningCouncil decided on 5 June 2003 to reduce the
key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. The
reduction was in line with the aim ofmaintaining inflation rates below, but close to,2% over the medium term and provided some
counterweight to the various factors adversely
affecting economic activity.During the second half of 2003 economicconfidence in the euro area first stabilised andthen gradually improved amid signs of a globaleconomic recovery. Uncertainty in stock markets
declined significantly, supporting the pick-up in
stock prices that had started in the second
quarter of the year. In this context, the likelihood
of a gradual economic upswing in the secondhalf of 2003, strengthening further in 2004,
increased.The recovery in global demand was the mainreason for the strong growth of euro area

exports, compensating for the lower externalprice competitiveness associated with thepronounced appreciation of the euro witnessed
since early 2002. In fact, in the second
half of 2003 euro area exports increased

significantly, after having declined in the first
half of 2003. Domestic demand remained weakin the second half of 2003. However, the lowlevel of interest rates and the generally
favourable financing conditions, as well as

positive terms-of-trade effects from the
appreciation of the euro, were expected to
support private demand. In addition, ongoingadjustment efforts in the corporate sector aimed24ECBAnnualReport
2003at enhancing productivity and profitabilitysupported the expectation that business
investment would recover gradually. Overall,
all available forecasts and projections produced
in the second half of 2003, including theEurosystem staff macroeconomic projectionspublished in December, pointed to a continued

strengthening of euro area real GDP growth in

2004 and 2005.The short-term downside risks to this scenario
of a gradual economic recovery declined duringthe second half of the year. At the end of 2003

the Governing Council assessed these risks as
being balanced. Over longer horizons, however,
uncertainty remained in relation to the

persistence of external imbalances in someother regions of the world and their potentialeffect on the sustainability of global growth.As regards prices, in the second half of 2003annual HICP inflation rates did not fall as
quickly and strongly as previously expected.
This was mainly a consequence of adverse foodprice developments and higher than expected oilprices after the end of the Iraq conflict, although
this latter effect was attenuated by the
appreciation of the euro. In addition, increases
in indirect taxes and administered prices in late
2003 and early 2004 affected inflation rates. InJanuary 2004 annual HICP inflation stood at1.9%.Nevertheless, in the second half of 2003 andearly 2004 the Governing Council assessed
that the outlook for price stability beyond theshort term remained favourable. Given that the
economic recovery was expected to be only
gradual, it was considered that moderate wage
developments in conjunction with a cyclical
recovery in productivity would contain growth
in unit labour costs. In addition, the renewedand significant appreciation of the euro wasexpected to continue contributing to subdued
import price developments, moderating Œ both
directly and indirectly Œ consumer price

inflation. In fact, in the course of 2003 the euro
appreciated by around 11% in nominal effectiveterms. At the same time, the Governing Councilrecognised that the outlook for price stabilityprevailing at the end of 2003 and in early 2004
was conditional on a number of assumptions
relating, inter alia, to global economic growth,

oil prices, exchange rates, wage developments
and fiscal measures. Furthermore, theGoverning Council felt that the indications of
increasing long-term inflation expectations
from bond markets warranted close monitoring.

With regard to monetary developments, M3
growth moderated only slowly in the secondhalf of 2003. This indicated a rather gradualshift of portfolios away from monetary assets

towards longer-term financial assets outside
M3. In addition, the low level of interest rates

contributed to the continued strong growth of
very liquid assets. At the same time, the annualrate of growth of loans to the private sectorincreased in the second half of 2003.In early 2004 there remained significantly moreliquidity available in the euro area than was
needed to finance non-inflationary growth. The
Governing Council stressed that whether theaccumulated excess liquidity would translateinto inflationary pressures over the medium
term depended very much on the extent to which

portfolio shifts were reversed and on the future
strength of economic growth. Indeed, should
excess liquidity persist, it could lead toinflationary pressures over the medium term. In
this context, the Governing Council emphasised
that monetary developments needed to be
carefully monitored.Overall, in the second half of 2003 and early2004 the Governing Council of the ECB
assessed the monetary policy stance as being

appropriate to maintain price stability over the
medium term. As a consequence, the key ECB
interest rates were kept unchanged in this
period. At the same time, the GoverningCouncil made it clear that it would continue tocarefully monitor all developments that might
affect its assessment of the risks to price
stability over the medium term.
25ECBAnnualReport
20032.1MONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M3 GROWTH REMAINED STRONGThe trend of high monetary growth in the euroarea, which started in mid-2001, continued in
2003. The average annual growth rate of thebroad monetary aggregate M3 increased even
further, to 8.0%, from 7.2% in 2002 and 5.4%
in 2001. However, the first and second halves

of the year showed diverging growth patterns.
In the first two quarters annual M3 growth
strengthened further, reaching a peak of 8.5%in the second quarter. It then moderated
somewhat, to stand at 7.6% in the fourth quarter

(see Chart 3).The continuing increase in M3 growth in thefirst half of 2003 reflected, to a large extent, avery strong liquidity preference on the part of
euro area investors in response to high financial
market and geopolitical uncertainties, the then
rather uncertain outlook for economic growth
and employment, and a rather flat yield curve.
Monetary growth was also fuelled by the lowlevel of interest rates.In the second half of the year, monetary growth
moderated only slowly. The improvement in
financial market conditions and in the economic
outlook only gradually induced economicagents to return to longer-term financial assets
and reduce their precautionary savings. In
addition, monetary growth continued to be
supported by the low level of interest rates.The strong M3 growth observed from mid-2001resulted in the accumulation of significantlymore liquidity in the euro area than needed
to finance non-inflationary growth. This is
illustrated by the sharp rise in the money gap
measures in Chart 4, which show the cumulative
deviations of M3 growth from its referencevalue since the beginning of 1999.2 Both the
nominal and the real money gaps continued to
increase steeply in 2003, and by the fourth
quarter they stood at their highest level since the
start of Stage Three of EMU.32MONETARY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTSThe main contribution to continued strongmonetary growth during 2003 came from themost liquid components, i.e. those which formthe narrow monetary aggregate M1 (see
Table 1). Among them, the persistently strong
annual growth rate of currency in circulation
reflected the fact that both residents and non-
residents of the euro area continued to increasetheir currency holdings in 2003. As a result, inthe second half of the year the stock of currency
in circulation reached a level in line with the
long-term trend observed before the cash
changeover. The growth of overnight deposits
was also pronounced in 2003, reflecting the lowopportunity costs of holding this type ofdeposit and, in the early part of the year, the
climate of high uncertainty.2The measure of the nominal money gap is the difference between
the actual level of M3 and the level of M3 that would have resulted
from constant M3 growth at its reference value of 4½% since

December 1998 (taken as the base period). The measure of the
real money gap is the difference between the actual level of M3
deflated by the HICP and the deflated level of M3 that would have

resulted from constant nominal M3 growth at its reference value
of 4½% and HICP inflation in line with the ECB™s definition of

price stability, again using December 1998 as the base period.
3It has to be kept in mind, however, that the choice of the base
period is to some extent arbitrary. Therefore, caution is warranted

when interpreting the level of these money gap measures.Chart 3 M3 growth and the reference value

the second half of 2003, suggests that economic
agents slowly started to reduce their

investments in safe short-term assets included

in M3 as financial market uncertainty decreasedand the yield curve steepened.Annual M3 growth declined further, to 6.4% inJanuary 2004, adding to the evidence that euro
area investors were gradually shifting the
structure of their portfolios towards longer-
term and riskier financial assets outside M3. Atthe same time, the low level of interest ratescontinued to fuel the demand for monetary
assets.Chart 4 Estimates of the nominal and real

Chart 5 provides an overview of the annual
flows of M3 and its counterparts in the

consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector.Increasing growth in M3 in the first half of2003 was mainly driven by a rise in the annual
increase of net external assets of the euro area
MFI sector and increasing growth in total credit
granted by MFIs to euro area residents, while
the expansion of MFI longer-term financialliabilities (excluding capital and reserves)remained broadly stable in this period. In the
second half of 2003 the moderation in M3
growth was accompanied by an increase in the
growth rate of MFI longer-term financial
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) and adecline in the annual increase of MFI netexternal assets. It appears that investors started
to again invest more in domestic and foreign
longer-term assets, as the yield curve steepened
and financial uncertainty lessened. However,
the expansion of total MFI credit to euro area
residents continued to increase.Looking in more detail at credit developments,the annual growth rate of MFI credit to euro
area residents increased from 4.1% in the fourth

quarter of 2002 to 5.9% in the last quarter of
2003. This rise reflected the higher borrowing
needs of both the private and the governmentsector.After declining between mid-2000 and the endof 2002, the annual growth of MFI loans to the
private sector (accounting for 87% of MFIcredit to the private sector) was relatively stablein the first half of 2003, before picking up in the
second half of the year. Particularly in the first
half, weak economic growth appears to have
counterbalanced the impact of the low bank
lending rates in the euro area. Thereafter, with
the economic outlook improving, the demandfor lending increased somewhat.Seen from a long-term perspective, in 2003the average annual growth rate of loans to
the private sector was, in real terms, about1¼ percentage points below its long-termaverage since 1980. However, compared with
previous periods of sustained weak economic
activity, loan dynamics remained relatively
robust in 2003, reflecting the structurally lower
interest rates prevailing since the introduction
of the euro.In 2003 the ECB introduced a quarterly banklending survey for the euro area. The survey

provides information on demand and supply
conditions in the euro area credit markets and is
designed to complement other statistics on MFIinterest rates and credit.4 At the beginning of
2003 almost half of the participating banks
reported that they were tightening financing
conditions for loans to enterprises. In the
course of the year, however, the number of
banks reporting a tightening of creditconditions fell continuously, indicating acertain stabilisation of credit conditions in the
euro area. As regards lending to households,
the number of banks reporting a tightening of

2003credit standards remained low throughout the
year, which may have supported a relatively
robust expansion of loans (particularly those
for house purchase) to households in 2003.Credit to general government acceleratedsubstantially in the course of 2003. This
development reflected the rise in general
government budget deficits, which was largely
linked, in turn, to weak economic growth in the
euro area.LIQUIDITY REMAINED AMPLEIn summary, annual M3 growth remained
strong in 2003, despite the moderation observed
in the second half of the year. As a

consequence, more liquidity has beenaccumulated in the euro area than needed tofinance non-inflationary economic growth.
However, the inflationary risks related to this
high excess liquidity were considered low,
given that the ample liquidity resulted, to a
significant extent, from past portfolio shifts and
that economic activity remained weak. Therelatively moderate growth rate of MFI loans tothe private sector in 2003 supported this
assessment.Looking ahead, should the unwinding of pastportfolio shifts not gain momentum, there is arisk that once economic activity strengthenssignificantly the excess liquidity could translate
into spending and lead to inflationary pressures
in the medium term. For this reason, the
Governing Council has repeatedly emphasised
the need to monitor monetary developmentsclosely.ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES RISINGIn 2003 the market for debt securities issued byeuro area residents grew at a slightly higher
pace than in 2002. The annual growth rate of theamount outstanding of debt securities increasedto 7.3% at the end of 2003, compared with 6.3%
at the end of 2002. The higher overall growth
was largely driven by developments in
the market for long-term debt securities, which

represented 90.5% of the total amountoutstanding of debt securities issued by euro
area residents at the end of 2003. Gross
issuance by euro area residents of euro-denominated debt securities accounted foraround 94% of issuance in all currencies in
2003. The euro also remained an attractive
currency for international issuers, with the
amount outstanding of euro-denominated debt
securities issued by non-residents of the euroarea increasing by 17.4% during 2003, ascompared with 12.9% during 2002.As regards resident issuers, the annual growth
rate of debt securities issued by the general
government increased from 5.0% at the end of2002 to 5.5% at the end of 2003 (see Chart 6).This was primarily due to an increase in
issuance activity by the central government sub-
sector, from 4.1% at the end of 2002 to 4.7% at

the end of 2003. The annual growth rate of debt
securities issued by the other government sub-sector, which primarily comprises local andChart 6 Sectoral breakdown of debt

2003Box 2THE CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES MARKET IN EURO AREA COUNTRIES
A broad and deep corporate debt securities market opens up a viable alternative avenue offinance for corporations. This could have important implications for economic developments. A
firm™s decision to issue securities is primarily driven by its need for funding, and its choice of

instrument involves a number of considerations, including taxes, bankruptcy and other costs.For the purposes of this box, the corporate sector includes non-financial corporations and non-monetary financial corporations and excludes MFIs. Non-monetary financial corporations
include insurance corporations and other financial intermediaries. The bulk of debt securities
issuance by non-monetary financial corporations is, however, carried out by what are known as
special financing vehicles. These are institutions which engage in financial activities, the main
purpose of which is to raise money on behalf of a third party, such as a credit institution, a non-financial corporation, an investment fund or the general government. Such vehicles can belegally owned by the companies to which they are providing funds or can be without capital
links to those companies, and can be established to facilitate a particular financial transaction. In

the latter case, they are known as special purpose vehicles (SPVs). SPVs act as a conduit for the

sole purpose of channelling funds from lenders to borrowers. They are precluded from engaging
in activities other than the transaction for which they were established and they immunise theinvestor against the potential bankruptcy of the original owner of the assets (originator).1The average annual growth rate of euro-denominated debt securities issuance by the corporatesector has largely outpaced the average annual growth in euro-denominated debt securities
issued by all sectors considered together since the start of Stage Three of EMU. The amount
outstanding of euro-denominated debt securities issued by non-financial corporations hasgrown at an average annual rate of 14% since January 1999, which is significantly higher thanthe 2% average annual growth rate for this sector during Stage Two of EMU. The same is true
for euro-denominated debt securities issued by non-monetary financial corporations, the
average annual growth rate of which has stood at 37% since January 1999, compared with 11%
during Stage Two of EMU. Today™s corporate debt securities market in the euro area has
broadened to include a variety of issuers, from various economic sectors, with diverse financing
needs and of variable credit standing. What used to be a corporate debt securities market limitedto borrowers rated AA or higher has been able to accommodate a broadening spectrum of credit

ratings. At the same time, the spectrum of economic sectors has broadened. Although non-
financial debt securities issuance activity was dominated by the telecommunications, media and
technology sector in 2000 and 2001, by 2003 this sector™s share of issuance activity had

returned to the levels seen before the introduction of the single currency.
Although growth in the corporate debt securities market has been very strong at the euro arealevel in the last three years (see Chart 6 in the main text), the trend towards increasing direct1For more detailed information on securitisation, see the box in the article entitled ﬁRecent developments in financial structu

access to this market is anything but uniformacross euro area countries.2 The chart shows
that the market for debt securities issued by
non-financial corporations is relatively well
developed in France, which accounted for

more than half of the amount outstandingof such securities at the end of 2003. The
corporate debt securities markets in Portugal,
Finland, the Netherlands and Belgium are also

relatively well developed. The cross-country
differences are, however, to some extent

accounted for by the fact that part of the
corporate debt securities issues have beencompleted through financial subsidiaries.In the euro area, the rapid growth of corporatebond issuance since 1999 has generally been
closely linked to the wave of mergers andacquisitions, which may in part explain whyfinancing through debt securities issuance
differs quite significantly across the euro area
economies. Another reason why corporate bond issuance is used to differing degrees across
euro area countries is that the institutional and fiscal frameworks and other historically

determined characteristics shaping the financial structure differ widely from one country toanother.The differences across euro area countries are even more pronounced in the case of the marketfor debt securities issued by non-monetary financial corporations (see the chart). According to
ECB statistics, the most important market for these securities in terms of GDP is the
Netherlands, followed by Italy and Spain somewhat behind. The Netherlands accounted foraround 60% of the amount outstanding of euro-denominated debt securities issued by non-
monetary financial corporations at the end of 2003. The situation prevailing in the Netherlands
is to some extent attributable to taxation factors. The actual ultimate beneficiaries in many cases

are residents of other euro area countries, which use special financing institutions in the
Netherlands only as a dedicated financing vehicle. The domestic activity in the Netherlands is
primarily driven by the securitisation of mortgage loans granted by MFIs.3 These mortgage-
backed securities, where the borrower or originator (e.g. the MFI) sells the loans to an SPV, arenot the same as covered bonds, which are debt securities backed by loans that remain on the
balance sheet of the borrower or issuer (e.g. the MFI). The latter are also known as Pfandbrief-
style products. All in all, as is the case for debt securities issued by non-financial corporations,
institutional, fiscal and historical factors largely explain the differences in the importance of
debt securities issued by non-monetary financial corporations in the various euro area
economies.2See ﬁReport on financial structuresﬂ, ECB, 2002.

2003regional governments, decreased to 21.9% atthe end of 2003 (from 28.0% at the end of
2002). The relatively high issuance activity in
both government sub-sectors reflects lessfavourable budgetary developments in generaland ongoing strong borrowing requirements
outside central government in particular.
The annual growth rate of debt securities issuedby MFIs increased from 5.4% at the end of 2002
to 6.2% at the end of 2003. By contrast, theannual growth rate of debt securities issued bynon-financial corporations increased sharply to
9.8% at the end of 2003, from 3.5% at the end of
2002. The annual growth rate of debt securities
issued by non-monetary financial corporations
was 23.3% at the end of 2003, compared with25.4% at the end of 2002. The strong overallissuance activity by the private non-MFI sector
was supported by a further improvement in
financing conditions and improved business

confidence in the course of 2003 (see Box 2).
The sharp increase in the growth rate of debtsecurities issued by non-financial corporationsin the course of 2003 has to be seen against the
background of subdued issuance activity during
the second half of 2002, when many companies
made efforts to reduce short-term liabilities in
order to protect themselves from financial
turbulence. Underlying the strong rebound inissuance activity in 2003 were increases in the
annual growth rates of both short and long-term
debt securities.As a consequence of these developments, theproportion of debt securities outstanding issuedby non-monetary financial and non-financialcorporations in the total amount outstanding of

debt securities issued by euro area residents
continued to increase, to 14.5% at the end of2003, from 13.4% at the end of 2002. This wasin line with the trend of an increasing non-MFI
corporate sector share in total debt securities

issuance that had prevailed over previous years
(see Table 2). Mirroring this evolution in 2003

was a decrease in the share of the MFI sector, to
38.0% at the end of 2003, whereas the share ofthe general government sector in the stock ofdebt securities decreased to 47.5%.

2003Box 3DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF EURO AREA HOUSEHOLDS AND NON-FINANCIAL
CORPORATIONS
Between the mid-1990s and 2000 the indebtedness of the euro area private non-financial sector
increased substantially, leading to relatively high debt-to-GDP ratios, particularly in the case of
non-financial corporations. Chart A illustrates these developments.As can be seen from Chart B below, non-financial corporations had a rising need for external
finance in the second half of the 1990s as their net borrowing or financing gap (i.e. the gap
between firms™ income Œ gross saving plus capital transfers Œ and gross capital expenditure)

increased. In addition, non-financial corporations™ financing needs rose on account of large net
purchases of financial assets as a consequence of the buoyant merger and acquisition activity
over that period. Subsequently, the deterioration of their financial position in conjunction with
a less favourable economic and financial market environment raised some concerns about thevulnerability of the non-financial corporate sector. However, when assessing the sustainability
of current debt levels, the interest payment burden also needs to be taken into account. In fact,
owing to the significant and sustained decline in the cost of debt financing over the 1990s, non-
financial corporations™ interest payments in relation to GDP have remained broadly stable since
1996.Since 2001 non-financial corporations have adjusted their balance sheets in order to graduallyreduce financial imbalances. Restructuring and cost-cutting measures as well as reductions inChart A Debt of the private non-financial

34ECBAnnualReport
2003both real and financial investments have resulted in a decline in the growth of financing and a
gradual rebound in the generation of internal funds. As a consequence, the financing gap of euro

area non-financial corporations gradually declined from a level of 3.5% of GDP in 2000 to 0.8%
in 2002, and is estimated to have remained broadly stable in 2003. At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio grew at a slower pace from 2001 onwards, and has stabilised more recently. Takingdue account, to the extent possible, of accounting differences, the level of indebtedness of euro
area non-financial corporations in 2003 was broadly similar to that of the United States and
below that of the United Kingdom and Japan.1Since 2001 there has been an overall improvement in the financial position of euro area non-financial corporations. This is also reflected in the more positive perception of risks in thissector from the end of 2002 onwards, as illustrated by the significant decline in corporate bond
spreads. Nevertheless, additional efforts to increase profitability and to improve balance sheet
positions may still be needed in some corporate sectors.With regard to the financial position of euro area households, their indebtedness has risencontinuously since the second half of the 1990s, reflecting, in particular, strong growth inhousing investment. Favourable financing conditions resulting from a considerable decline in
mortgage interest rates fuelled the demand for housing loans and supported strong rises in
house prices in some euro area countries. At the same time, developments in house prices
bolstered the need for larger loans to purchase a house, while also resulting in wealth gains and
higher collateral values. Notwithstanding the upward trend in household debt ratios, the interest
payment burden on households measured as a percentage of GDP remained below the levels
observed in the early 1990s because of the strong decline in the cost of debt financing. Inaddition, comparing household debt ratios across major industrialised countries, euro area
households are significantly less indebted than households in the United States, the United
Kingdom and Japan.1Owing to a recovery in the household saving ratio since 2001 in the context of high economicuncertainty (especially in relation to employment), the net lending of the euro area householdsector has risen. In 2002 it stood at levels slightly lower than those seen in the mid-1990s (see
Chart B) and is estimated to have stabilised in 2003. Consequently, the financial position of
euro area households appears relatively sound, although in some euro area countries some risks
may exist in connection with rapid rises in house prices.1See the article entitled ﬁDevelopments in private sector balance sheets in the euro area and the United Statesﬂ in the Februar
y 2004issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
Household demand for debt financingcontinued to expand strongly in the course of2003, despite weak economic growth (seeChart 7). This was related to ongoing robust
demand for loans for house purchase, supported
by a further rise Œ particularly in some countries
Œ in residential property prices and by the low
level of mortgage lending rates. The annual
growth rate of short-term debt financinggradually declined, to reach negative territory in
the second quarter of 2003.The annual growth rate of debt financing ofnon-financial corporations recovered somewhat
in the first half of 2003, mainly in connection
with short-term debt financing growth. By
contrast, in the second half of the year theannual growth rate of debt financing of non-35ECBAnnualReport
2003financial corporations remained broadly stable.Overall, developments in debt financing of non-
financial corporations have led to a broadly
stable debt-to-GDP ratio of the sector in recent
years (see Chart A in Box 3).By contrast with the relatively robust growth ofdebt financing, the annual growth rate of quoted

shares issued by non-financial corporations
remained subdued in 2003. However, there was

a slight recovery in the course of the year linkedto a rise in stock prices, which tends to lowerthe cost of equity financing.
Finally, the annual growth rate of debtfinancing of general government rose during
most of 2003, owing largely to weak economicgrowth putting strains on government finances.ONGOING RELUCTANCE OF THE NON-FINANCIAL
SECTOR TO INVEST IN SHARES
The annual growth rate of financial investment
of the non-financial sector recovered somewhat
during the first three quarters of 2003. In thefirst two quarters this was mainly driven by arise in short-term financial investment growth,
reflecting the then prevailing preference of
economic agents for safe and liquid assets. In
the third quarter, however, the annual growth

rate of short-term financial investment declinedsomewhat in connection with the steepening ofthe yield curve and receding financial market
uncertainty.Long-term financial investment growthremained broadly stable in the first half of 2003and rose in the third quarter. At the same time,the annual growth rate of investment in long-
term debt securities fell in the first half of the
year and remained subdued thereafter. The fall
was probably related to the low level of interest
rates, periods of relatively high bond marketvolatility and, from the second quarter onwards,a recovery in stock prices, which increased
the relative attractiveness of equity over bond
investments. The annual growth rate of
investment in mutual fund shares (excluding
money market fund shares) increasedconsiderably during the first three quarters of2003. Investment in quoted shares by the non-financial sector also recovered, although the
annual growth rate remained subdued compared
with the late 1990s. This points to ongoing,
albeit declining, caution on the part of economicagents with regard to shares, following the
losses made on equity holdings from early 2000
onwards.MARKET INTEREST RATES AT VERY LOW LEVELS
In line with the decisions of the GoverningCouncil to reduce the key ECB interest rates inMarch and June 2003, money market interest
rates decreased in the first half of the year,
continuing the downward trend that started in
mid-May 2002. After the reduction of the key

subsequently rose in an environment in which
the prospect of an economic recovery became
more certain.The market had broadly expected the reductionsin key ECB interest rates in the first half of2003. Longer-term money market interest rates
fell early in the year against a backdrop of
subdued economic growth and the appreciation
of the exchange rate of the euro, which led to
expectations of a decline in inflationarypressures. The slope of the money market yieldcurve, as measured by the difference between

at different maturities declined by similaramounts (see Chart 8).
In mid-2003 the downward trend in money
market rates started to reverse as pessimism
subsided and market expectations gradually

shifted towards an economic recovery in theeuro area in an environment in which moreliquidity was available than needed to support
non-inflationary growth. Towards the end of
the year, part of the increase in money market
rates was reversed, as the appreciation of the

THROUGHOUT 2003Global bond markets were characterised by
pronounced yield fluctuations in 2003, with
bond yields in the major economies following
broadly similar patterns. The volatility resulted
from market participants™ changing perceptions
about the outlook for economic growth,inflation and the related monetary policy stance.Particularly during the first quarter of the year,
uncertainties related to geopolitical tensions
played an important role, as the high level of

risk aversion triggered portfolio flows from
equity to bond markets. The weakening of these
uncertainties, as well as clear indications of arecovery in the major economies, prompted a

partial reversal of these flows later in the year.
All in all, ten-year government bond yields in
the euro area and the United States increased by
around 10 and 50 basis points respectively in
2003 and stood at around 4.3% at the end ofthe year in both cases (see Chart 10). Thedifferential between US and euro area long-term
bond yields hovered around zero throughout the
last few weeks of the year, whereas it had been
in negative territory for most of the year until
then.In the United States, government bond yieldsdeclined during the first half of the year,
continuing the trend that started in 2002. These
developments reflected market participants™
more pessimistic perceptions about the short to
medium-term outlook for economic activityamid tensions stemming from geopolitical
uncertainty and disappointing macroeconomic

data. In addition, bond yields declined as a
result of investors™ increasing concern about
the risk of deflationary tendencies in the USeconomy. Consequently, ten-year government
bond yields reached historically low levels of
3.1% by mid-June. The rebound in bond yields

which started thereafter was mainly driven by
upward revisions of market participants™
expectations for economic growth and inflation,but may also have been related to their mounting

the downward trend in US bond yields and the

strong rebound over the summer. Despite this
strong rebound, long-term bond yields in the
United States ended the year at relatively lowlevels, partly reflecting perceptions amongmarket participants that the Federal Reserve
would keep short-term interest rates at very low
levels for a considerable period.Market participants™ uncertainty regardingfuture bond yield movements in the US market
remained relatively high throughout the year.
This is suggested by the implied volatility on
ten-year US Treasury futures, which reached
fairly high levels from a historical perspective,
in particular during the summer. Theuncertainty seemed to reflect Œ to some extent Œ
38ECBAnnualReport
2003the ongoing debate among market participantsover the sustainability of very low long-term

bond yields in the United States.In Japan, long-term bond yields broadlyfollowed the same pattern as in the UnitedStates and the euro area, albeit remaining at
much lower levels. In the first half of 2003

Japanese ten-year bond yields reached
historical lows (around 0.4% in mid-June),

reflecting investors™ growing pessimism aboutthe outlook for the Japanese economy. Marketparticipants™ concerns stemmed from the strong
appreciation of the yen vis-à-vis the US dollar Œ

which was perceived as negatively affecting

Japanese exporters Œ as well as from the effects
of the SARS epidemic. Ten-year bond yieldsrebounded sharply during the third quarter andthen stabilised at the end of the year, to reach
1.4% on 31 December, which was close to the

levels last seen at the beginning of 2002.
Expectations of a swifter economic recovery, as
well as portfolio shifts from bonds to stocks,

contributed to a rise in long-term bond yieldsduring the second half of the year.In the euro area, bond market developments in2003 to a large extent mirrored those in the
United States, although euro area bond yields
fluctuated somewhat less. In the first half of2003 market participants gradually became lessoptimistic about growth prospects, which
pushed long-term interest rates lower. The
high degree of uncertainty surrounding the
geopolitical situation was reflected in an
increase in market participants™ risk aversionand thus prompted ﬁflight-to-safetyﬂ flowsfrom the stock to the bond market. From mid-

June onwards euro area bond yields began to
rise, although less markedly than in the United
States. These developments reflected market
participants™ upward revisions with regard toexpected economic growth and Œ to some extentŒ upward revisions of inflation expectations.
Indeed, the break-even inflation rate, measured
as the difference between the yields on ten-year
nominal and index-linked bonds, increased
somewhat after mid-June, although this waspartly also due to technical factors (seeChart 11 Euro area long-term real bondyield and break-even inflation rate(as percentages; daily data)Sources: Reuters, French Treasury and ISMA.Note: The euro area real bond yields are derived from themarket prices of French government bonds which are indexed to

in 2003 according to developments in implied
bond market volatility. Moreover, and bycontrast with the situation in the United States,implied bond market volatility in the euro area
was, in general, not particularly high in 2003.
Financing conditions in euro area corporate bondmarkets improved significantly in the first part ofthe year and remained very favourable until theend of 2003. The relative cost of financing for

measured by the differential between the yields on
bonds issued by such corporations and
comparable government bonds, declinedmarkedly Œ by around 150 basis points Œ in2003 and stood at around 80 basis points

Short-term MFI interest rates6 declined during the

households (i.e. redeemable at a period of notice
of up to three months) and overnight deposits by

around 30 basis points, to 2.0% and 0.9%

2003rate fixation of up to one year) declined by
around 60 basis points, to 3.1% in December,

while the rates on bank overdrafts to households
decreased only slightly, by around 20 basis
points, to 9.7%. These developments in short-term MFI interest rates took place against the
background of a decrease of around 70 basis
points in the three-month money market rate in
2003. The pass-through of the marked drop in
market rates to short-term bank interest rates was
broadly in line with the historical pattern, inparticular the fact that rates on overnight depositsand on typical short-term savings deposits tend toadjust particularly slowly to changes in market rates.Long-term MFI interest rates on new businessdeclined during the first half of 2003 but
rebounded from August onwards, broadlyreflecting the pattern in comparable government
bond yields (see Chart 13). For the entire year,
the rates on loans to households for house
purchase with over five and up to ten years™initial rate fixation and on long-term loans
to non-financial corporations (loans over
1 million with over five years™ initial ratefixation) decreased by around 35 and 30 basispoints, to 5.0% and 4.3% respectively. Thus,
general developments in long-term MFI interest
rates were another indication of the very
favourable financing conditions that prevailed
throughout 2003. As regards long-term MFI

deposit interest rates, rates on long-termdeposits by households (i.e. with an agreedmaturity of over two years) fell by around
80 basis points between January and December

2003their first annual increases since 1999 (seeChart 14a). Increasing stock prices were
accompanied by significant drops in implied
stock market volatility, which is a measure of

market participants™ degree of uncertainty (seeChart 14b).In general, developments in broad stock marketindices in the United States, Japan and the euro

area followed similar patterns in the course of

2003. Up to mid-March stock prices declined inthese markets on account of investors™ morepessimistic outlook for the global economy,
increased uncertainty and risk aversion. All of
these factors appeared to be closely related to

intensified geopolitical tensions and the
prospects of war in Iraq. The apparent globalﬁflightﬂ from equities was also spurred byincreased concerns about corporate earnings
quality in the wake of repeated accounting
scandals. For the rest of the year stock prices in
the major markets followed a solid upward
trend. Initially, the stock market rebound was
set in motion by the normalisation of marketconditions resulting from market participants™fading uncertainty at the outset of the military
operations in Iraq. In the second half of the
year stock prices were further bolstered by
continuously improving corporate earnings,
abating stock market uncertainty and a brighteroutlook for the world economy.Overall, between end-2002 and end-2003, stockprices in the United States, as measured by the
Standard & Poor™s 500 index, increased by
26%. In Japan, stock prices, as measured by theNikkei 225 index, increased by 24%, while inthe euro area the Dow Jones EURO STOXX
index gained 18% over the same period.In the United States, the strong increases instock prices in 2003 might have also beenbolstered by the economic stimulus packagepassed by the US congress at end-May,

including a reduction in dividend and capital
gains taxation rates. The improved corporate
outlook was corroborated by corporate earnings
reports that, for most of 2003, exceededexpectations. While the better than expectedearnings figures seemed mainly to reflectsuccessful cost-cutting measures in the first
half of 2003, they were further supported by the
recovery in general business activity during the
second half of 2003.In Japan, stock prices declined during the firstfour months of 2003, following market
concerns about non-performing loans in the
Japanese banking sector that continued to

negatively affect stock prices. In addition, thestock prices of export-oriented firms were
adversely affected by the strengthening of the
Japanese yen vis-à-vis the US dollar. Later,
between April and mid-September 2003,
Japanese stock markets rebounded strongly
against the background of improved economic
data and sounder corporate earnings reports,and possibly also as a result of spillover effects
from the US stock market. From mid-September
onwards stock prices broadly stabilised.In the euro area, stock price developments tendedto be strongly synchronised with movements inUS stock markets. As with the United States, theoverall rise in euro area stock prices reflected
declining stock market uncertainty together with a
market perception of a more favourable economic
and corporate outlook. As regards the sectoral

breakdown, the general increase in euro areastock markets was mainly driven by thetechnology, financial and consumer cyclical
sectors, which had seen proportionally larger
declines during 2002. In addition, in the financial
sector, the improvement of financial market
conditions after March 2003 together with cost-
cutting efforts and lower loan loss provisionsseemed to have a positive impact on the
profitability of banks.In the period from end-2003 to 27 February 2004the Dow Jones EURO STOXX index, theStandard & Poor™s 500 index and theNikkei 225 index increased further, by 5%,
3% and 3% respectively. These increases seemed
to reflect further indications of improved

corporate profitability, lower long-term interest
rates and further declines in stock marketuncertainty.42ECBAnnualReport
20032.2PRICE DEVELOPMENTS
Despite subdued economic activity and theappreciation of the euro, overall HICP inflation
in the euro area averaged 2.1% in 2003, whichwas only 0.2 percentage point lower than in theprevious two years (see Table 4). The main
reason for the decrease with respect to 2002
was lower average year-on-year growth rates
in non-energy industrial goods and services
prices, which also allowed for a decline in theaverage growth rate of the HICP excludingunprocessed food and energy to 2.0% from
2.5% in 2002. In this context, the pattern of
overall HICP movements throughout 2003
reflected developments in the more volatile sub-
components: energy and unprocessed foodprices. Cost pressures were subdued over 2003as producer prices showed moderate growth
rates and nominal labour cost growth levelled
off. However, the decline in labour productivity
growth in the context of weak economic activity
led to an increase in the growth rate of unit
labour costs in the first half of 2003.In January 2004 overall HICP inflation fell to1.9%, down 0.1 percentage point compared
with December 2003. This was mainly due to
strong base effects in energy and tobacco
prices, partly offset by the upward impact fromadministered prices and indirect tax changes.The year-on-year rate of change of the HICP

excluding energy and unprocessed food prices

remained unchanged at 1.9%.HEADLINE INFLATION REFLECTED

COMPONENTSOverall HICP inflation followed a rather erratic

pattern over 2003 as a whole (see Chart 15).
Headline inflation rose in early 2003, asgeopolitical uncertainties related to the war inIraq pushed up energy prices. Once these
geopolitical uncertainties had lessened, and as
the euro continued to appreciate against the US
dollar, the contribution of energy developments
eased and headline inflation resumed itsdownward trend to reach 1.8% in May, the
lowest rate of increase in three years. In the
second half of the year, however, headline
inflation hovered around 2%, mainly reflecting
two opposing influences. On the one hand,
there was a rising contribution from food prices
Œ unprocessed food prices rose as a result of the
summer heatwave in Europe, while increases in
tobacco taxation also pushed up processed food
prices. On the other hand, the contribution from
energy prices declined with respect to the first

despite some direct impact via energy prices, to
the appreciation of the euro. This was also true
for the HICP excluding energy and unprocessed
food.Processed food prices in 2003 were mainlyinfluenced by increases in tobacco prices as a
result of increases in indirect taxation in some
countries both in the first few months of the
year and, especially, in the latter part of theyear. This translated into a contribution of thismain sub-component to overall inflation ofaround 0.4 percentage point.Services prices growth in 2003 showed agradual decline from the fairly high level

growth of services prices followed a downward

price growth to overall inflation declined to

2003Box 4INFLATION DIFFERENTIALS IN THE EURO AREA: POTENTIAL CAUSES AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
The diversity of inflation developments among the euro area countries Œ as captured by variousdispersion indicators Œ declined significantly over the 1990s. Following the start of Stage Three
of EMU in 1999, inflation dispersion continued to decline, reaching its lowest level in the
second half of 1999. However, it then picked up modestly until early 2001. Since then, inflation
dispersion in the euro area has remained broadly stable, before declining again during 2003 tolevels close to those seen in the second half of 1999. All in all, the extent of inflation dispersionobserved at present in the euro area is not notably different from that in the United States.
Notwithstanding the currently low level, by historical standards, of inflation dispersion in theeuro area, the euro area has witnessed relatively persistent inflation differentials over the past
four years. With the exception of Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Finland, all euro area
countries have experienced inflation persistently either above or below the euro area averagesince 19991. In particular, five countries (Greece, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal)have experienced relatively large and persistently positive inflation differentials vis-à-vis the
euro area, which however have started to narrow since 2002 in Portugal and in the course of
2003 in Spain, Greece and Ireland. In the Netherlands, meanwhile, the inflation differential vis-
à-vis the euro area has actually turned negative recently. By contrast, Germany and Austria haveobserved persistently negative inflation differentials. This box briefly reviews the potentialcauses and the policy implications of inflation dispersion in the euro area.21Based on annual average inflation rates in 1999-2003.

2003Potential causesWith respect to the inflation differentials observed in the euro area, it needs to be stressed thatthe single monetary policy implied a regime shift, the effects of which on price formation
processes would take several years to unfold. In particular, the move to Stage Three led to

strong declines in interest rates in Ireland, Portugal and Spain and later in Greece, i.e. in
countries where inflation rates had been systematically above the euro area average before the
mid-1990s. In most of the other euro area countries, these nominal convergence effects wereconsiderably less sizeable. However, the equilibrating effect of changes in nationalcompetitiveness triggered by inflation differentials is likely to limit the size and persistence of
inflation differences emanating from the adjustment to the new monetary regime. In this respect,
countries with below-average inflation rates should benefit from a gain in competitiveness and
also, in the short term, from the relatively smaller adverse effect of inflation on real disposable
income and real wealth. Meanwhile, other things being equal, countries with above average
inflation rates should suffer from competitiveness losses and larger negative effects of inflationon real income and wealth.In addition to the special effects related to the start of Stage Three, a combination of temporaryand more persistent factors on inflation developments seems to have caused the observed
inflation differentials. As for the temporary factors, one-off domestic policy measures, such as
changes in administered prices and indirect tax measures, have varied across countries and havethus contributed to the inflation differentials. However, these measures do not seem to have
accounted for much of the observed inflation differentials since the start of Stage Three and are

unlikely to play a larger role unless domestic policy measures increasingly diverge across euro
area countries in the future. Moreover, differences in the speed of implementing structural

reforms across countries may temporarily translate into higher inflation differentials. Different
levels of exposure to external shocks Œ because of national discrepancies in the degree of
openness concerning extra-euro area trade and oil dependency Œ also appear to contribute, albeittemporarily, to inflation differentials.Furthermore, there is a relationship between cyclical positions and inflation rates: euro areacountries with above average inflation rates have seen the strongest average growth rates in
domestic demand, alongside relatively large positive output gaps. The opposite applies to theeuro area countries with below average inflation rates. Cross-country differences in the fiscal
policy stance may have also played a role in explaining inflation differentials, notably in
countries like Greece and Ireland, where fiscal policies have been relatively expansionary in the

last few years.
Finally, with regard to more persistent factors, inflation differentials in Greece, Ireland,
Portugal and, to a lesser extent, Spain may have been partially caused by price level and income
convergence and/or what are known as Balassa-Samuelson (BS) effects3. Conversely, low3The BS effect explains that prices of non-tradable goods normally rise faster than prices in the tradable goods sector because
productivity growth is normally lower in the non-tradable goods sector. As wages in the tradable goods sector are driven up by
productivity growth, wages in the non-tradable sector will tend to increase as well. As the latter wage increases are not matched byproductivity gains, labour costs and prices will increase faster in the non-tradable goods sector. With prices in the tradable goodssector set internationally, countries with high productivity growth differences between sectors will tend to see a larger incre
ase in theoverall price index.46ECBAnnualReport
2003productivity growth differentials between the tradable and non-tradable goods sectors inGermany may have contributed to lower than average inflation in that country. However, the
observed inflation differentials among some euro area countries have been significantly larger

than would be implied by the BS model, according to available estimates. Other structural

factors, such as  wage and price rigidities or differing degrees of competition in key domestic

markets, may also have contributed to the observed inflation differentials and their persistence.In this respect, empirical studies show that the relative degree of market competition seems to bean important parameter in explaining the size and volatility of relative price responses to shocks
across euro area countries. In any event, the continuation of the convergence process among the
euro area countries should lead to a decline in inflation dispersion owing to price level and
income convergence in the long run.  However, given the current heterogeneity of national

economic structures and countries™ exposure to idiosyncratic shocks, it is likely that somedifferences in inflation rates will continue to exist in the future.Policy implicationsSince the start of Stage Three it has no longer been possible to deal with regional economic
imbalances and (asymmetric) shocks in the euro area countries using monetary policy. On thecontrary, the single monetary policy of the ECB can only be geared towards the objective ofprice stability for the euro area as a whole. Just as in any monetary union, inflation differentials
within the euro area reflect different regional price dynamics and adjustments in relative prices
and, as such, cannot be addressed by the single monetary policy. At the same time, the ECB™s

monetary policy strategy attributes a secondary role to unavoidable inflation differentials when
calibrating the safety margin for admissible inflation in the euro area, since their existence might
have implications for lower-inflation regions. Moreover, inflation differentials remain animportant communication challenge for the ECB since monetary policy is often discussed fromthe viewpoint of national inflation rates and its implications for national economic policies.Large and persistent inflation differentials may justify national remedies in some countries inorder to prevent undue losses in competitiveness. National economic policies, such as fiscal and
structural policies, need to be adjusted to counteract persistent and potentially damaginginflation differentials. Structural reforms, particularly measures aimed at removing nominalwage and price rigidities and leading to a more diversified wage-setting process within
individual euro area countries, can speed up the wage and price adjustments necessary to deal

with shocks, including a more synchronised response of national prices to shocks. Such
policies would, in turn, lower the likelihood of persistent inflation differentials in the euro area.

Finally, given its considerable time-lags, fiscal policy may be ill-suited to fine-tuning inflationdevelopments in the short run, although it may be used to address inflation differentials over thelonger term, particularly if a country experiences persistently positive inflation differentials.goods remained roughly constant at around0.8% throughout 2003, approximately half the
rate of increase recorded in 2002, leading to

a contribution to overall inflation of around
0.2 percentage point.Inflation dispersion in the euro area declinedduring 2003 after having remained broadly
stable over the previous two years. Box 4

2003Public perception of past inflation, as measuredby the European Commission™s qualitative
indicator of perceived inflation over the past 12
months, showed a gradual decline in the first
half of 2003. However, this decline wasinterrupted in the summer as unprocessed foodprices rose as a result of the heatwave in
Europe. This gives some support to the view
that consumers™ inflation perceptions are
largely influenced by developments in
frequently purchased items, which mostlybelong to the out-of-pocket expenditurecategory. This also helps to explain the
somewhat volatile pattern of inflation
perceptions. In the second half of 2003
consumers™ inflation perceptions seemed to
have stabilised at fairly high levels by historicalstandards. By contrast, throughout 2003consumers™ inflation expectations for the next
12 months remained at very low levels by
historical standards.MODERATE PRICE PRESSURES AT THE PRODUCER

LEVELThe annual rate of growth in total industrial
producer prices (excluding construction)
declined in the course of 2003, reflecting the
effects of the appreciation of the euro exchange
rate counterbalancing those of higher oil and
non-oil commodity prices (see Chart 17). Thisled to an annual average increase in producerprices of 1.6% in 2003. Weak economic
conditions may have also prevented firms from
increasing producer prices for most of the year.The pattern followed by the annual rate ofgrowth of overall producer prices in 2003 waslargely the result of developments in energy
and intermediate goods prices. Reflecting
developments in oil prices, the annual rate of
change in industrial energy prices increased in
the first few months of the year but easedthereafter, supported by the moderation ofoil prices and the appreciation of the euro. The
annual rate of growth in intermediate goods
prices, which averaged 0.8% in 2003 as a
whole, was higher in the first half of the year
and declined in the second half as the impact ofthe exchange rate appreciation worked through.Chart 17 Breakdown of industrial producerprices(annual percentage changes; monthly data)Source: Eurostat.industry excluding construction (right-hand scale)

12As usual, the two other main components ofoverall producer prices, capital goods and
consumer goods prices, displayed much more
stability in their year-on-year rates of growth.
This suggests that the weak demand conditionsmay have prevented firms from passing onincreases in energy and intermediate goods
prices in early 2003 to later production stages.
The annual average growth rates in consumer
goods and capital goods prices were 1.1% and
0.4% respectively.NOMINAL LABOUR COST GROWTH LEVELLED OFF
IN 2003The gradual upward movement observed in the
rates of growth of euro area-wide labour and
wage cost indicators since 1999 levelled off atthe beginning of 2003 (see Table 5).Growth in compensation per employee showeda decline in the second half of 2002 and
remained roughly unchanged in the first three
quarters of 2003.48ECBAnnualReport
2003Available information on compensation peremployee shows some noticeable differences at
the sectoral level in the first three quarters of
2003. The rate of growth in the construction
sector rose in the first half of 2003 and easedthereafter, while in industry excludingconstruction there seemed to be a gradual
decline over the year as a whole. As for
services, growth in compensation per employee
seemed to stabilise in 2003 for the sector as a
whole. However, some counterbalancing
effects were observed within sub-sectors: theincrease in market-related services (whichinclude trade, hotels and restaurants, finance
and business services) in the first two quarters
eased in the third quarter, whereas the growth
rate in non market-related services increased in
the third quarter. These developments suggestthat the lower rates of growth in industrialactivity may be behind the decline in labour cost
growth in industry during the first three
quarters of 2003. Labour cost developments
in services may also help to explain some
resilience of services prices over the year as awhole, given the higher share of labour costs inthe services sector.The rate of growth of negotiated wages fell in2003 compared with 2002, and gross monthly
earnings appeared to follow a similar trend. Anoticeable moderation in labour cost growthwas also observed when measured on the basis
of hours worked, as the growth rate of hourly
labour costs in the first three quarters of 2003
were lower than the average growth in 2001 and
2002.Given that growth in compensation per
employee was roughly unchanged in the first
three quarters of the year, the lower
productivity growth in the second and third
quarters of 2003 led to an increase in unitlabour costs from 2.0% year on year in the firstquarter to 2.7% in the second and 2.4% in the
third. Profit mark-up developments, as proxied
by the gap between the annual rates of growth in
the GDP deflator and unit labour costs,
indicated that the delayed recovery in economic
activity in the euro area continued to exertpressure on profits. However, in the secondhalf of 2003 some improvement in productivity
growth helped to moderate unit labour cost
growth.Chart 18 Sectoral compensation peremployee(annual percentage changes; quarterly data)Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.industry excl. constructionconstruction

DEVELOPMENTSRECOVERY IN ACTIVITY DURING 2003Economic activity in the euro area picked up inthe second half of 2003, having generallystagnated since the fourth quarter of 2002 (see
Table 6). However, earlier expectations for
growth in 2003 as a whole had to be scaled
back. Real GDP grew by 0.4%, slowing further
from a rate of growth of 0.9% in 2002 andremaining below the trend rate of growth inpotential output for the third successive year. In
addition, labour market developments were
subdued throughout the year. This lacklustre
performance emphasised the need to enhance
the euro area™s structural flexibility andresilience to shocks. Box 5 reviews theprogress made with the EU™s reform agenda.At the start of 2003 a number of factors,  such
as the continued subdued activity in the
world economy, were contributing to weakeconomic conditions. Moreover, the decline inbusiness and consumer confidence was
reinforced by the high degree of uncertainty in
the run-up to the Iraq war. Towards the middle
of the year the geopolitical uncertaintygradually dissipated, giving rise to growingconfidence and a pick-up in activity driven by

foreign demand.EXPORTS TRIGGERING RECOVERY ON THE

EXPENDITURE SIDEThe pick-up in activity in the second half
of 2003 reflected the positive effects of
improving foreign demand on euro area exports.
However, this impact was dampened by the
appreciation of the euro. The contribution to
quarter-on-quarter growth from net exports,which had turned positive in the third quarter,turned negative again in the fourth quarter
in the face of strong import growth (see
Chart 19). In 2003 as a whole net exports
made a negative contribution to growth of
0.6 percentage point.50ECBAnnualReport
2003Box 5PROGRESS WITH STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN EURO AREA PRODUCT AND LABOUR MARKETSStructural reforms in product and labour markets are essential to enhance the euro area™seconomic growth potential and facilitate adjustment to economic change. Measures to raise the
potential rate of economic growth are all the more important in view of the downward impact
that population ageing is likely to have on labour supply. In March 2000 the Lisbon European

Council focused on the importance of modernising the regulatory framework and introduced anambitious reform agenda aimed at making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. This box briefly reviews the progress made in
implementing the EU™s reform agenda over recent years and particularly in 2003.The EU monitors and evaluates the functioning of product markets as part of the ﬁCardiffprocessﬂ, whereas labour market reform is assessed within the ﬁLuxembourg processﬂ. Bothprocesses examine reforms in each of the different countries and provide input into the BroadEconomic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs), which define overarching priorities for various fields of
economic policy. These priorities then form the basis of policy recommendations which are
made for each EU Member State.1In the field of labour markets, the BEPGs for the period 2003-05 stress the need to: (i) improvethe combined incentive effects of taxes and benefits in order to make work pay, (ii) ensureefficient, active labour market policies targeted towards the most disadvantaged groups,
(iii) promote a more flexible organisation of work and review employment contract regulations,
(iv) facilitate geographical and occupational mobility and (v) ensure that wage bargaining

systems allow wages to reflect productivity.A number of countries have implemented reforms in their tax/benefits system in order to reducenon-wage labour costs and encourage labour supply. Tax rates have decreased for incomes at
the bottom and the middle of the distribution; employees™ and employers™ social security

contributions have been reduced, particularly for the low-paid. Moreover, progress has been
made in increasing the participation rate among people at the margin of the labour market. Some
Member States have strengthened the role of temporary work agencies, and some obstacles topart-time work have been removed.All in all, most EU countries introduced labour market reforms in 2003. However, alsoconsidering the still high level of structural unemployment, reforms seem to lag behind what is
implied in government announcements. Limited progress has been made in attracting more
people into the labour market, investing in human capital accumulation, and increasing theadaptability of both workers and enterprises to changing macroeconomic conditions. Measures
aimed at reducing long-term unemployment through retraining, as well as improving the

employability of low-skilled and older workers, can be seen as priority areas for reforms.
Moreover, further reforms are needed to encourage labour mobility by improving the1Council Recommendation of 26 June 2003 on the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community
.The 2003 BEPGs were adopted for the period 2003-05.
51ECBAnnualReport
2003transferability of pensions and healthcare rights as well as by allowing wage differentiationaccording to local, regional and sectoral differences in productivity.
The structural reform agenda for product markets covers a wide range of areas. Among other
things, the BEPGs urge Member States to foster competition in goods and services markets by(i) transposing Internal Market directives more quickly into national legislation, (ii) further
opening up public procurement, (iii) giving adequate powers and resources to competition
and regulatory authorities and ensuring their independence, (iv) reducing state aid and

(v) encouraging market entry and effective competition in network industries.
After many years of continuous progress, the percentage of EU Internal Market legislationwhich Member States had not yet transposed into national law (known as the ﬁtransposition
deficitﬂ) started to increase in 2002, and the deterioration continued in 2003. The European
Commission has taken several initiatives to improve the functioning of the Internal Market.
There are, nevertheless, still some significant barriers to this, particularly in the services sector.
Many of these barriers appear to be due to national regulations, for example administrative
procedures for setting up subsidiaries in other euro area countries. As far as the reinforcementof competition is concerned, there are indications that many euro area countries have taken steps
to improve the efficiency and transparency of public procurement procedures. In addition, some
countries have increased the powers of their competition and regulatory authorities. Moreover,

over recent years the trend towards reducing and redirecting state aid seems to have continued,
although it still plays an important role in some sectors, such as transport. Euro area countrieshave continued to implement regulatory reforms in network industries, albeit to varyingdegrees. Nevertheless, effective competition in these previously sheltered sectors could be
increased further.To sum up, the pace of reform continued to be rather slow in 2003. This adds to the concernthat the EU may not be able to achieve the Lisbon targets unless Member States vigourously stepup their efforts. Besides offering long-term growth benefits, renewed momentum in the processof structural reform would foster consumer and investor confidence, thus also entailing some

shorter-term stimulus to growth.Changes in the contribution to growth fromdomestic demand over the course of 2003 were
largely explained by developments in inventorychanges. The restocking in the first half of the
year, which followed a two-year period of

depleting inventories, was possibly induced by
uncertainty regarding the supply of imported
intermediate goods and unexpected declines indemand 
associated with the war in Iraq. Thisinventory build-up was partly unwound in
the third quarter but resumed in the final quarter
of the year. The contribution to real GDP
growth from inventory changes in 2003 was

0.3 percentage point, slightly higher than in theprevious year.Final domestic demand (i.e. excluding changesin inventories) remained subdued for most of
2003, with only a slight pick-up in the second
half of the year. Its overall contribution to real
GDP growth in 2003 was 0.7 percentage point.
Developments in fixed capital formation and
private consumption diverged over the course
of the year. Fixed capital formation declined inthe first three quarters, but the pace of declinegradually became slower and in the fourth
quarter fixed capital formation recovered to
positive rates of growth. By contrast, private
consumption grew at a rate of 0.4% quarter on
quarter in early 2003 but almost stagnated forthe remainder of the year.52ECBAnnualReport
2003A common factor having a negative impact on
fixed capital formation and private consumption
in the first half of 2003 was the uncertainty
associated with the war in Iraq and the outlook

for the economy in its aftermath. This meant

that households were hesitant to make majorpurchases and firms were reluctant to expandtheir production capacities. It also concealed
the fact that the underlying conditions for

consumption and investment were relatively
favourable. In particular, the low level of
interest rates alleviated the debt servicingburden of households and firms. Moreover, theterms-of-trade gains associated with the

appreciation of the euro increased real income

in the domestic economy.The uncertainty about the general economicoutlook coincided with ongoing efforts by
corporations to consolidate their balance

sheets. In this context improvements in
profitability may have been used for further
de-leveraging rather than capital spending.
Continued uncertainty about labour marketprospects and job security may have ledhouseholds to adjust their saving according to
precautionary motives rather than to support
consumption. In a number of countries the
discussions on implementing reforms to social
security and health systems may have added tohousehold uncertainty and fuelled the motivefor precautionary saving. With clearer signs of
an upturn in economic activity in the second
half of the year, firms became less hesitant to

invest, although households™ consumption
spending remained subdued.
INDUSTRY DRIVING RECOVERY ON THE OUTPUT

SIDEBoth industry and market services contributed
to the recovery in output in the course of 2003,

but the contribution from industry was
stronger. Output in purely market-relatedservices, as measured by real value added,

picked up somewhat earlier than in industry
(excluding construction). This was broadly in
line with the observation that services
confidence had started to improve in the second
quarter of 2003, whereas industrial confidence
had started to improve in the third quarter (see
Chart 20). However, developments diverged in
the final quarter of the year, with output in
industry accelerating further and output in
market services declining somewhat.When comparing the average rate of outputgrowth in 2003 with the rates in previous years
and over the business cycle, the performance of
the services sector was relatively weak. Growth
in real value added in market services was
0.7%, declining further compared with the
previous two years and reaching a lower levelthan in the recession of 1993. By contrast,
growth in industry (excluding construction)
was -0.1%, somewhat lower than in the

previous two years but in line with the rates of
growth typically observed during economicdownturns.The pick-up in industrial activity in the secondhalf of 2003 largely reflected the recovery in
exports of goods, consistent with the

pronounced cyclical sensitivity of production ineuro area countries to external developments.Chart 19 Contributions to quarterly realGDP growth(quarterly percentage point contributions; seasonally adjusted)Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.1) Percentage change compared with the previous quarter.real GDP 1)domestic demandnet exports

2003Both intra- and extra-euro area exports appearto have provided impulses for the pick-up in
industrial production (excluding construction)in the second half of 2003 (see Chart 21).LESS DISPERSION IN OUTPUT GROWTH ACROSSCOUNTRIESVarious dispersion measures indicate that the

divergence of real GDP growth rates declinedamong euro area countries in 2003. Reflectingin part the global economic slowdown, annual

average real GDP growth decreased in most
euro area countries in 2003 compared with the

year before, except for Belgium, Spain and
Greece, where growth increased moderately; inItaly growth remained virtually unchanged.EMPLOYMENT LARGELY STABLE DURING 2003
In some contrast with overall output, the levelof euro area employment appears to have
remained broadly stable throughout 2003 (seeTable 7). This was also the case for most of2002. The national data available for thefourth quarter of 2003 suggest that annual
average growth in total employment was around
0.1-0.2% in 2003. Employment thus provedmore resilient than might have been expected
given the protracted period of subdued

economic activity. However, while employment
remained largely stable, the data available from
labour force surveys suggest that hours workedper employed person have declined relativelystrongly in the past few years and thus
accounted for much of the labour market
adjustment that is typically associated with

an economic slowdown. To some extent this
would contrast with developments observedin previous economic slowdowns, whereemployment rather than hours bore the brunt of
the adjustment.Adjustments in hours worked per employedperson might partly reflect increased labourmarket flexibility, for example by allowing theChart 20 Confidence indicators(percentage balances)Sources: European Commission Business and Consumer Surveys.Note: All data are seasonally adjusted.

employment during 2003 implies that, measured
per person employed, improvements inaggregate labour productivity only emerged inthe second half of the year when activity started

to pick up. Measured per hour worked, gains in
labour productivity might fade out more
quickly, given that the previous downward
adjustment in average hours worked is likely tobe reversed as the recovery unfolds.The broadly unchanged level of totalemployment in the course of 2003 conceals
opposite developments in industry and services.
In the first three quarters of 2003 employmentdeclined in industry, but this was offset by netjob creation in services. However, in both
industry and services average employment
growth in 2003 was most likely lower than in
2002. Moreover, data from labour force surveys
suggest that the adjustment in labour inputs viahours worked per employed person featured inboth sectors.RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CAME TO A HALT

IN 2003The rise in the euro area unemployment raterecorded since early 2001 came to a halt in thespring of 2003, with the rate remainingunchanged at 8.8% for the rest of the year. On

average, the unemployment rate was 0.4
percentage point higher in 2003 than in 2002.
This rise was broadly spread over the individualage groups and genders, although the gapbetween the unemployment rate for those
below 25 and that for persons aged 25 and
above rose somewhat further, while the gap
between the unemployment rates for women and
men continued to decline.Most euro area countries suffered an increasein the unemployment rate between 2002 and
2003, with the exception of Greece and Italy,
where unemployment declined, and Finland
and Spain, which observed a broadly constant
unemployment rate. All in all, the degree ofdispersion in unemployment rates declined
among euro area countries in 2003. However, in
some countries, the unemployment figures
recorded for 2003 partly reflect outflows from
the official statistics due to changes in therecording of unemployed persons and/or as a
consequence of labour market reforms.
While the euro area-wide rate of unemploymentwas broadly stable in the course of 2003, the
number of unemployed increased somewhat
further for most of the year. In December the

environment which was considerably less
favourable than anticipated. Most Member States
failed to meet the targets set out in the stabilityprogrammes that were submitted at the end of
2002 and the beginning of 2003. On average,

targets were missed by nearly 1.0% of GDP.Fiscal developments remained a source ofconcern in countries that had already recorded
significant fiscal deficits in 2002. Deficits inGermany and France were close to or above 4%

of GDP in 2003, while Portugal recorded a
deficit close to 3% of GDP in spite of the
implementation of large-scale temporary
measures. The general government deficit in theNetherlands was 3% of GDP in 2003.On the spending side, in 2003 the euro arearatio of government expenditure to GDP

increased compared with 2002, with persistent
upward pressure on current outlays largely
originating from higher unemploymentexpenditure and related social transfers.Interest expenditure declined slightly in 2003.

On the revenue side, slow tax revenue growth in
2003 can mainly be accounted for by the
weakness in economic activity and by other
unexpected shortfalls in tax revenues.Unfavourable budgetary developmentsadversely affected the average government debt
ratio. After several years of uninterrupted,
albeit moderate, decline, the euro area debt-to-

GDP ratio increased to 70.4% in 2003. Thisworsening reflects the protracted deteriorationof the primary surplus and the moderate growth
of nominal GDP. In 2003 the debt ratio
exceeded 60% of GDP in France, while in
Germany and Austria it remained above that
reference value and in Belgium, Greece andItaly it stood above 100% of GDP.
The fiscal stance in the euro area was broadlyneutral in 2003, when measured by the change
in the cyclically adjusted primary balance
according to European Commission estimates.This reflects the control of cyclically adjustedtotal number of unemployed was 12.3 million,an increase of around 270,000 persons
compared with one year earlier (see Chart 22).
With a broadly stable level of employment, therise in the number of unemployed reflectscontinued growth in the labour force. However,
labour force growth in 2003 was somewhat
lower than in the previous year. The rise in the
unemployment rate and a further fall in the
vacancy rate most likely discouraged labourmarket participation, for example by delayingentry into the labour market.2.4FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS
BUDGET BALANCES DETERIORATED FURTHER IN
2003The euro area fiscal balance deteriorated in
2003 for the third year in a row. The latest

available data from Eurostat show an average
deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2003, against 2.3% in2002 (see Table 8). The marked deterioration56ECBAnnualReport

Commission™s recommendations in respect ofGermany and France and to hold the excessivedeficit procedure for these countries in
abeyance. In its conclusions, the ECOFIN
Council recommended that France achieve a
reduction of 0.8% of GDP in its cyclically
adjusted deficit in 2004 and a reduction of atleast 0.6% in 2005 in order to bring the deficitbelow 3% of GDP by 2005 at the latest. At thesame time, the ECOFIN Council recommended
that Germany reduce its cyclically adjusted
deficit by 0.6% of GDP in 2004 and by at
least 0.5% in 2005 in order to bring the deficitbelow 3% of GDP by 2005 at the latest(see Chapter 4). The ECOFIN Council™s
decision has led to uncertainty on the future
implementation of the rules governing fiscal
policy in euro area countries. It also sets a
precedent of a lax implementation of theexcessive deficit procedure that could weakenincentives for consolidation in the future.It is essential that confidence in the solidity ofthe institutional underpinnings of EMU be
maintained. Germany and France now have tolive up to their responsibilities and to honourGeneral government surplus (+) / deficit (-)2000200120022003

2003their commitment to correct their excessivedeficits as soon as possible and by 2005 at the
latest. Countries that still face fiscal imbalances
also need to make progress towards achieving
budgetary positions close to balance or insurplus over the medium term, by reducing theirunderlying deficit by at least 0.5% of GDP per
year.The implementation of sound fiscal policies isin the interest of all countries. Close-to-balanceor in-surplus budgetary positions create roomfor the free play of automatic stabilisers, which
facilitates the smoothing of economic business
cycles. Sound public finances also help

individual countries to cope with the budgetary
impact of population ageing by reducing public
debt ratios. Lack of discipline, on the otherhand, increases the uncertainty surrounding the
future soundness of public finances, thus
hindering the long-term decision-making of

economic agents. It may also create externalities
that could negatively affect other Member
States.According to the stability programmessubmitted at the end of 2003 and the beginning

of 2004, the euro area deficit is expected to
decline by 0.3 percentage point in 2004 to 2.4%
of GDP. Consolidation effects stemming fromexpenditure restraint, the fall in interestpayments and the gradual recovery in economic
activity should outweigh the expansionary
effects associated with tax cuts in a number of
countries. The cyclically adjusted balance in the
euro area is forecast to improve in 2004.Deficits in Germany and France are expected to
decrease but stay above 3% of GDP in 2004.
According to the ECOFIN Council opinions,

the adjustment path in France™s stability
programme seems insufficient to eliminate the
excessive deficit by 2005, while Germany™sadjustment path may also be insufficient tocorrect the excessive deficit by that year.
Moreover, based on the Commission™s
calculations, as reported in the ECOFIN

Council opinions, Greece, Italy and Portugal
seem unlikely to reduce their cyclically adjusteddeficit by at least 0.5% of GDP in 2004.STRUCTURAL REFORM OF PUBLIC FINANCES
REMAINS VITAL
The pension reforms implemented or envisaged
in some countries will improve the long-term
sustainability of public finances. However, the
significant ageing of the European population
will make further adjustments necessary (see
Box 6). Fiscal consolidation should be part of a
credible medium-term reform package. The
combination of consolidation and structural
reforms may counteract the negative short-termdemand effects of budget retrenchment byenhancing the credibility of euro area
governments and public confidence in their
ability to adhere to the agreed rules and to

ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.Structural reforms on the expenditure sideare particularly important. To promote the
quality of public finances, expenditure
priorities should be shifted towards productive
expenditures fostering potential output growth.
The reduction of overall expenditure
commitments will create scope for a declinein the tax burden, thereby contributing toeconomic growth.58ECBAnnualReport
2003Box 6THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS FOR SUSTAINABLE PUBLIC FINANCES
To ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, euro area countries need to implement substantialfiscal and other reforms.Population ageing and fiscal sustainabilityOne of the most important risks to fiscal sustainability in the euro area economies arises from
population ageing. Eurostat projects that the old-age dependency ratio, i.e. the population aged
65 years and older as a proportion of the population aged 15 to 64, will rise from about 25% in
2000 to more than 50% in 2050. This demographic shift will put pressure on public finances by
pushing up old age-related expenditure, in particular in public pensions and health, as well as

long-term care. Public pension systems in Europe are mostly based on the pay-as-you-goprinciple. As current contributions finance current expenditure, the rising number of pensioners
will put these systems under strain. Healthcare expenditure is set to rise, as the demand for
health services tends to increase in old age. Past experience suggests that technical
developments may also contribute to rising health expenditure.
A recent study commissioned by the ECOFIN Council and carried out by the Working Group onAgeing of the Economic Policy Committee1 has projected that in most euro area countries, the
increase in public pension expenditure due to population ageing will be between 3 and 6
percentage points of GDP by 2050. A further 2 to 4 percentage points of GDP could relate to a

rise in health and long-term care expenditure.The EU strategy for addressing the ageing problemIn light of the need for comprehensive reforms, the EU agreed in 2001 on a three-pronged
strategy to tackle the pressures of population ageing. This strategy was first set out in the 2001
Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and prescribes: (i) measures to raise employment rates,
(ii) a rapid reduction in government debt and (iii) further reforms of pension and health systems,
including a greater reliance on funding. The EU fiscal framework provided by the Treatyestablishing the European Community and the Stability and Growth Pact also addresses thefiscal challenges of population ageing by demanding medium-term budgetary positions close to
balance or in surplus and by setting limits on deficit and debt levels.Current policiesCurrent fiscal policies in the euro area present a mixed picture as regards action taken to enhance
sustainability. First, while the approaches taken to pension and health reform point in the right

direction, the planned measures will generally not suffice to ensure the sustainability of those
systems, and further changes are necessary. The thrust of most of the pension reform efforts is
to raise effective retirement ages, e.g. by creating incentives to stay in the workforce and by
increasing the contribution periods required to acquire full pension entitlements. Efforts in the1The study is available from the website of the European Commission™s Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs at

2003health sector tend to focus on restraining short-term expenditure growth, for instance by raisingawareness of the cost of medical treatments by increasing patient co-payments. Second, the
current high fiscal deficits are, to a large extent, of a structural nature. This means that on top of

meeting the fiscal requirements imposed by the projected demographic changes, the countries in

question will need to pursue ambitious structural consolidation policies to achieve a sound
budgetary position.2.5  THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC
ENVIRONMENT, EXCHANGE RATES AND THE

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY GAINEDMOMENTUM IN 2003Following a period of uncertainty in the first
half of 2003 Œ relating mainly to geopolitical
tensions, terrorist threats, the SARS epidemicand deflationary fears Œ the recovery of theworld economy gained momentum in the second
half of the year. By the end of 2003 the upswing
had broadened and strengthened, driven mainly
by growth dynamics in the United States and
Asia. While private consumption and
expansionary economic policies supported thegradual upturn in global economic activity,business investment, in particular, remained

relatively muted in some industrialised
countries owing to overcapacity and the degree
of corporate indebtedness. Inflationary
pressures remained relatively low, given thestrong growth in productivity, particularly inthe United States, and the continuing significant
overcapacity. Imbalances persisted throughout
2003. Most notably, the US current account
deficit rose further, notwithstanding the
considerable depreciation of the US dollar.In the United States, the recovery broadened in2003 with GDP growth amounting to 3.1%, up
from 2.2% in 2002. In early 2003 high

geopolitical uncertainty in the run-up to the Iraq
war undermined investors™ and consumers™confidence, thereby contributing to a delay inthe US economic recovery. However, economic

activity rebounded in the second quarter as
these geopolitical uncertainties receded, leading
to a significant strengthening of growth in the
second half of the year. Household spendingremained resilient and contributed substantiallyto GDP growth. Real private consumption grew
by 3.1% in 2003, experiencing a large surge

especially over the summer months. Animportant factor driving household spendingwas the effect of tax cuts, which helped to
maintain growth in disposable income (4.3%

in 2003 compared with 5.2% the year before).

Further support came from mortgage
refinancing activity during the first half of theyear. All these factors together outweighed thenegative impact of low confidence and the
unfavourable employment situation on
household spending until the third quarter. In
the context of a strong housing market and
historically low mortgage rates, real residential
investment accelerated vigorously to 5.2% in2003.One notable source of weakness through muchof 2003 was a receding labour market, though in
the third quarter some signs of improvement in
labour market conditions emerged. Privatepayroll employment contracted significantlyduring the first half of 2003 and then picked up
moderately. The unemployment rate started to
decline in the summer after reaching a peak of
6.4% in June, falling to 5.6% in January 2004,
an improvement partly due to a slowdown in thelabour force.After two years of contraction, businessinvestment grew by 4.3% in 2003. Following
the initial rebound in the second quarter,
business investment growth increasedthroughout the rest of the year, reachingannualised double-digit numbers. The recovery

in capital expenditure relied on favourable
financing conditions, rising profits and strong

demand prospects. This recovery was still
narrowly based, since it was concentratedin hardware and software expenditure. With60ECBAnnualReport
2003regard to trade, growth in import volumesoutpaced that in exports in 2003, in line with the
higher growth of domestic demand in the United
States than in its main trading partner countries.
Accordingly, the current account deficitincreased to more than 5% of GDP for 2003,reflecting, to a large extent, public sector
imbalances.Consumer price inflation and producer priceinflation in the United States increased in 2003.However, correcting for the impact of energyprices, inflationary pressures remained
generally weak in the course of the year owing
to low capacity utilisation rates and strong
productivity growth. Inflation, as measured by
the consumer and producer price indices,increased to 2.3% and 3.2% respectively in2003, up from 1.6% and -1.3% in 2002.
Excluding food and energy, consumer price
inflation was 1.4% in 2003, down from 2.4% in

2002, and producer price inflation (excluding
food and energy) remained subdued.Interest rates remained at historical lows in2003. The Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) of the Federal Reserve System
reduced the target for the federal funds rate

by 25 basis points in June 2003, to 1%. The

accompanying statement of the FOMC meetings
up to December stated that policyaccommodation would be maintained for a
ﬁconsiderable periodﬂ given the risks of an
unwelcome fall in inflation. At the January
2004 meeting, however, this statement was
replaced by the reference to a ﬁpatientﬂapproach by the FOMC in terms of removingpolicy accommodation. Fiscal policy was still
markedly expansionary in 2003, with the
federal budget deficit increasing to 3.5% of
GDP in the fiscal year 2003, from 1.5% of GDP
in the fiscal year 2002. This resulted mostnotably from discretionary budgetary measuresand, to a lesser extent, from the automatic

response of the budget to the business cycle.In Japan, real economic activity expandedthroughout 2003, supported by exports andprivate investment. After some initialweakening of the export momentum, exportgrowth increased in the second half of the year.
In particular, exports to non-Japan Asia
exhibited strong growth, with China accounting
for more than half of the overall increase inexports in 2003. Against the background ofhistorically low inventory levels, the export
growth translated into a pick-up in industrial
production in the second half of the year, with
particularly strong gains in the export-oriented
general and electrical machinery sectors.Private non-residential investment spendingexpanded strongly, supported by a recovery in
firms™ profits and some structural improvements
in corporate balance sheets. Reflecting continued
weaknesses in the labour market and the income
situation, private consumption spending was
relatively sluggish. Owing to continued effortsto achieve medium-term fiscal consolidation,

government spending contracted, reflecting
large declines in public investment outlays.Deflationary pressures eased somewhat in
2003. The CPI declined on average by 0.3%,compared with a decline of 0.9% in 2002. TheBank of Japan raised its target range for the
outstanding balance of the current accounts held
at the Bank of Japan from JPY 15-20 trillion at
the beginning of 2003 to JPY 30-35 trillion in
January 2004. In addition, the Bank of Japandecided to purchase asset-backed securities fora limited time, with the objective of promoting
the smooth financing of small and medium-
sized enterprises.Non-Japan Asia™s economic performance wasrobust in 2003, consolidating the recovery in2002. The region proved to be fairly resilient to
some adverse shocks, including the geopolitical
uncertainties (namely, the Iraq war and tension
in North Korea) and the SARS epidemic.
Strong output growth stemmed from theconfluence of different factors. First, foreigndemand benefited from an improvement in the
global economy and the depreciation of
effective exchange rates, as evidenced by the
brisk pace of export activity in many countries
of the region. Second, domestic demand Œ whiledecelerating markedly in the second quarter as a61ECBAnnualReport
2003result of the SARS outbreak Œ later grew morethan initially expected. At the country level,
China has remained by far the region™s fastest-
growing economy, with GDP expanding by
9.1% in 2003.In the EU acceding countries, output growthremained resilient in 2003 despite the weak
external environment. Real GDP growth was
mainly driven by private consumption and net
exports, while investments also showed signsof strength in some countries. Fiscal positionscontinued to deteriorate in several countries,
posing serious challenges to the sustainability
of public finances. Average HICP inflation in
the acceding countries as a whole remained
close to 2%, although sizeable differencesprevailed at the country level (see Chapter 7 forfurther details).In Latin America, there were some signs ofoverall economic improvement in 2003 as
Argentina experienced a strong rebound from
the previous year™s crisis. Among the region™stwo largest countries, Brazil™s GDP contractedand Mexico recorded rather sluggish output
growth. The Brazilian economy exhibited
negative growth on a year-on-year basis over
the last three quarters of 2003, largely as a
result of a downturn in domestic demanddespite a slight decline in financing costs. Themain drag on the Mexican economy was the
manufacturing sector, whose exports have
lagged behind the recovery in the United States.Brent crude oil prices averaged USD 28.9 perbarrel in 2003, 15.4 % higher than the previousyear. The increase was the result of supply
disruptions, pent-up demand, low inventory levels
and geopolitical tensions. Non-oil commodity
prices also strengthened considerably in 2003
owing to a pick-up in global economic activity. Inparticular, Chinese demand for raw materials hada strong impact on commodities markets.EURO EXPERIENCED STRONG APPRECIATION IN

2003In 2003 the euro continued its appreciationagainst major currencies. This was mostpronounced against the US dollar and severalAsian currencies, reflecting their formal or
informal peg to the US dollar. The euro also
strengthened against the Japanese yen, the
pound sterling and the Swiss franc, albeit to alesser extent, while it weakened against theAustralian dollar.In the first half of 2003 these developmentstook place against the background of relatively
high economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Theupward pressure on the euro was temporarilysuspended in the summer amid positively
revised market expectations about the economic
recovery in major partner countries. Towards
the end of 2003 the euro experienced renewed
gains as market analysts became increasinglyconcerned about global external imbalances.Overall, at the end of 2003 the nominal effective
exchange rate of the euro was almost 11%
higher than at the beginning of the year and
nearly 17% above its average level in 2002.In the first two months of 2004 the effectiveexchange rate of the euro did not appreciatefurther. The developments in euro exchange
rates over this period seem to have been
affected by a combination of factors pointing in
different directions, including market reactions
to the communiqué issued by the G7 in earlyFebruary 2004 on exchange rate movements.On 27 February 2004, the cut-off date for this
Annual Report, the nominal effective exchange
rate of the euro had appreciated by 3.8%
compared with the average for 2003.The real effective exchange rates of the euro,which take into account developments in price
and unit labour cost differentials between the
euro area and its main partner countries, tracked
the nominal index fairly closely and stood, in
the fourth quarter of 2003, somewhat abovetheir levels in the first quarter of 1999 (seeChart 23).In 2003 the strengthening of the euro wasparticularly strong against the US dollar, which
faced broad-based depreciation pressures. In thefirst months of the year, uncertainty generated by62ECBAnnualReport
2003rising geopolitical tensions and their likely
effects on the global economic outlook seem tohave weighed on the US currency. Moreover, anumber of weaker than expected economic data
releases for the United States, the widening of
the US current account deficit and a deteriorating
fiscal position were identified by market
participants as additional negative factorsaffecting the US dollar in the first half of 2003.Over the summer months the US dollar stabilised
amid firming market expectations about
improving prospects for US economic growth.
Towards the end of the year, however, market
concerns over the financing of the US currentaccount deficit seemed to overshadow thesepositive factors, thereby exerting renewed
downward pressure on the US currency. On
30 December 2003 the euro stood at USD 1.25,
which was roughly 19½% stronger than at the
beginning of the year and more than 32% above
its average level in 2002. On 27 February 2004the euro was quoted at USD 1.24, i.e. 9.8%
stronger than the 2003 average.Against the Japanese yen, the euro showed a
pattern similar to the one against the US dollar
until September 2003. The developments in theJapanese yen seem to have been mainly related
to evidence of an improvement in economicactivity in Japan together with the foreignexchange market interventions by the Japanese
authorities in an attempt to stabilise the yen
against the US dollar. In the aftermath of the G7

meeting in Dubai Œ where it was stated that

more flexibility in exchange rates was desirable
to promote smooth and widespread adjustments
in the financial system based on market
mechanisms Œ the yen came temporarily under
strong and broad-based appreciation pressure.
At the end of 2003 the euro was quoted at JPY
133.7, 7.5% higher than at the beginning of theyear and more than 13% above the 2002
average. On 27 February 2004 the euro traded at
JPY 135.6, 3.6% above its average in 2003.Turning to other European currencies, the euroexperienced an appreciation against thepound sterling, the Swiss franc and, moresubstantially, the Norwegian krone, while it
was broadly unchanged against the Swedish

krona and the Danish krone. The latter

continued to fluctuate in a very narrow range
close to its central parity in the exchange ratemechanism II (ERM II).Chart 24 Current account balance and itscomponents(EUR billions; 12-month cumulated seasonally adjusted)Source: ECB.currentaccountservicescurrent

euro area foreign demandCURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS DECREASED IN2003In 2003 the euro area current account surplusfell to 28.1 billion (0.4% of GDP), from 67.1billion in 2002 (0.9% of GDP). The fall
stemmed mainly from a 
20.6 billion drop in thegoods surplus and a 16.0 billion rise in theincome deficit, while the current transfersdeficit also increased. These developments were
only partly offset by a small rise in the services
surplus (see Chart 24). As imports of goods
remained broadly unchanged in 2003 relative to
a year earlier, the reduction in the goods surplusresulted from a fall in the value of euro area
goods exports (by 2.2%) over the same period.7The increase in the income deficit stemmed
mostly from a reduction in income credits. The

appreciation of the euro in 2003 largelyexplains this development, as the value of
income credits received in foreign currencies is
lower when expressed in euro.A better understanding of export developmentscan be obtained through a breakdown of thevalue of euro area goods exports into volumes
and prices Œ based on External Trade Statisticsdata until the third quarter of 2003. Such abreakdown suggests that, compared with 2002
average levels, the fall in the value of exports in
the first three quarters of 2003 stemmed from a

decrease in export prices.8 Euro area exporters
lowered their prices in euro in an attempt to
offset the loss in price competitivenessresulting from the appreciation of the euro (see
Chart 25). Meanwhile, export volumes declined
in the first half of 2003 and subsequently
recovered in the third quarter.  Sluggish foreign

demand and the impact of the appreciation of theeuro contributed to the initial fall in euro areaexport volumes, while the strong pick-up in
foreign demand in the third quarter of 2003
seems to have been the key explanatory factor
behind their recovery. Overall, in the first three
quarters of 2003 export volumes were slightlyChart 26 Financial account

thereby pointing to a loss in euro area export
market share.NET OUTFLOWS IN COMBINED DIRECT AND
PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN 2003In the financial account, combined direct and
portfolio investment experienced net outflows
of 9.3 billion in 2003, compared with net
inflows of 61.9 billion in 2002 (see Chart 26).This development largely reflected lowernet inflows in portfolio investment (by
91.6 billion), which were only partlycounterbalanced by declining net outflows in
direct investment (by 20.3 billion) over thesame period.Transactions in debt instruments mainlydominated developments in net portfolio
investment flows. More specifically, after
recording net inflows of 52.8 billion in 2002,net investment in debt instruments turned
negative in 2003 Œ showing net outflows of27.4 billion (see Chart 26). This reflectedprimarily a sizeable switch in money market
instruments from net inflows to net outflows,
as foreign investors seem to have begun

re-allocating their international portfolio in
favour of riskier assets, particularly in the
second half of 2003. The improvement in theglobal economic outlook over this period Œ also
evidenced by the solid performance in global
equity markets Œ is likely to have been the main

driving factor behind this development. At the

same time, net inflows in bonds and notes alsodeclined somewhat in 2003 compared with ayear earlier. However, much of this decline

reflected disinvestment by non-residents in
euro area bonds and notes that took place in
July and August of 2003 amid expectations of
capital losses as a result of a rise in long-termbond yields.Both euro area direct investment and portfolioinvestment in equity securities moved, overall,
towards a balanced position in 2003. Much of

this related to economic and geopolitical
uncertainty stemming from the war in Iraq andthe SARS epidemic that adversely affectedinvestment decisions in the first half of the year
(see Chart 26). As uncertainty receded and
equity prices rebounded, cross-border activity
in portfolio equity securities first stabilised andthen gradually began to rise. Similarly, in thesecond half of 2003 euro area direct investment
abroad also started a gradual recovery in the

light of an improved global as well as domestic
economic outlook, while foreign direct
investment in the euro area remained subdued.65ECBAnnualReport
2003The Eurosystem and the NCBs of the non-euroarea EU countries cooperate closely in the
context of the General Council of the ECB. A
regular review of macroeconomic conditions
and monetary and exchange rate policies formsan integral part of the coordination exercisebetween the Eurosystem and the three NCBs not
currently participating in the single monetary
policy. Although these NCBs conduct their

monetary policies within different institutional

and operational frameworks, the ultimate goalof monetary policy for all of them is the
maintenance of price stability.DENMARKThe Danish economy slowed in 2003, with the
real GDP growth rate falling to 0.0%, down
from 1.0% in 2002 (see Table 9). In the first
half of 2003 domestic demand, most notably

investment, remained subdued. However,
domestic demand picked up again during the3ECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS IN
EU COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EURO AREA
remainder of the year in line with increasingconsumer and industrial confidence. The upturn
in private consumption was supported by low
interest rates, the introduction of instalment-
free mortgages, higher real disposable incomeand housing wealth. As a result of sluggish
foreign demand, export growth declined
in comparison with the previous year.
Accordingly, imports grew slightly faster than

exports in 2003. Over the same period the
unemployment rate increased to 5.6%.Annual inflation decreased to 2.0% in 2003 (seeChart 27). This development was due mainly to
cuts in indirect taxes (a reduction in excise
duties on alcohol, tobacco and soft drinks) and
low energy prices resulting from the
depreciation of the dollar. The decline ininflation was also supported by price falls in
insurance and communications. Unit labour
costs increased slightly in 2003, as wage
increases were accompanied by slightly lower
productivity growth.199920002001200220032003200320032003

2003The general government fiscal surplusdecreased from 1.7% of GDP in 2002 to 1.5%
of GDP in 2003. This was partly attributable to
lower tax revenues and higher unemployment
benefits paid to households on account of thecyclical downturn. Government debt declinedfrom 47.2% of GDP to 45.0%. According to the
updated Convergence Programme, public
finances in Denmark are expected to remain
sound, with general government surpluses
projected to reach 1.3% and 1.8% of GDP
in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Compared withthe previous update of the Convergence
Programme, the decline in projected surpluses

can be attributed mainly to the phasing-in of
income tax reductions in accordance with the
2003 Tax Agreement. The gross debt ratio isprojected to fall to 41.2% of GDP in 2004 and
to 38.7% in 2005.Denmark is currently the only countryparticipating in ERM II. It continues to pursue a
fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro,
with a narrow band of ±2.25% around itsERM II central rate of DKK 7.46038 against theeuro. Developments in key official and short-
term market interest rates should primarily be
seen against the background of the ECB™s
interest rate decisions and developments in the
exchange rate of the krone against the euro.During 2003 the Danish krone remained veryclose to its central parity in ERM II, holding a
level marginally above its central rate. Foreign
exchange reserves peaked in June 2003 before
declining slightly towards the end of the year.
The strength of the krone was due mainly torelatively low inflation and a considerablebalance of payments surplus.In 2003 Danmarks Nationalbank reduced itslending rate three times, lowering it to 2.15%
where it stood at the end of the year. During the
course of the year the spread over the minimumbid rate on the Eurosystem™s main refinancing
operations declined to 15 basis points, while the
spread between Danish and euro area short-term
market rates narrowed to around 5 basis points(see Chart 27). Danish long-term bond yieldsincreased, fluctuating around an average of
4.3%.SWEDENReal GDP growth in Sweden slowed somewhat
in 2003, to 1.6%, compared with 2.1% in 2002

(see Table 10 and Chart 27). With the effects of
earlier tax cuts levelling off and uncertaintyremaining high owing to geopolitical events,private consumption and investment growth
remained subdued in the first half of 2003. In
addition, a public sector strike negatively
affected real GDP growth in the second quarter
of the year. Private consumption strengthenedagain in the second half of 2003, in line with
increasing consumer confidence, while
investment and industrial production remained
subdued. Exports were relatively strong
throughout the year and net exports contributed
to real GDP growth, albeit not quite as much as

in the previous year. Employment declinedslightly in 2003, while the total number ofhours worked declined more significantly, as in
2002. This led to relatively strong increases in

labour productivity (especially if measured by
hours worked) and, combined with moderate
wage growth, to a subdued development of unitlabour costs. The unemployment rate increasedin the second half of the year to stand at around
6% of the labour force.Inflation rates, as measured by the HICP, theCPI and UND1X,9 rose to above 3% in early
2003 (see Chart 27), reflecting increases inenergy prices resulting from low water supplies
in the production of hydroelectric power and
rising oil prices. As these price increases were9UND1X is defined as the CPI excluding interest expenditure and
direct effects of altered indirect taxes and subsidies. In Sweden
headline CPI is the target variable of monetary policy. As transient

factors have had an impact on the inflation forecast in recent
years, monetary policy decisions have in practice been based on
an assessment of UND1X  or, as was the case in 2003, on UND1X

excluding energy.

only temporary, inflation decelerated rapidly to
around 2% in mid-2003. While the CPI
continued to decelerate thereafter, the HICP and

UND1X remained close to 2%. This was mainly
the result of declining interest expenditure,included in the CPI but not in the HICP orUND1X. On average, annual HICP inflation
was 2.3% in 2003, up from 2.0% in 2002, while

the CPI rose by 2.1%, compared with 2.4% in
2002.The general government fiscal surplusimproved from 0.0% of GDP in 2002 to 0.7%
of GDP in 2003. The debt-to-GDP ratio
decreased slightly from 52.6% in 2002 to 51.8%
in 2003. According to the updated Convergence
Programme, public finances in Swedenare expected to remain sound. General
government surpluses are projected to reach
0.4% and 1.2% of GDP in 2004 and 2005
respectively. The development indicates
some deviation in relation to the Swedish fiscal
rule that a surplus of around 2% is to bemaintained over the business cycle. The grossdebt ratio is expected to decline to 51.5% in2004 and to 50.0% in 2005.Sveriges Riksbank operates under a flexibleexchange rate regime with the objective ofmonetary policy expressed as an explicitinflation target of a 2% annual increase in the

CPI, with a tolerance margin of ±1 percentage
point. In 2003 Sveriges Riksbank reduced the
repo rate by a total of 1 percentage point to
2.75%. This came against a background of arisk of undershooting the inflation target of 2%following prospects of weaker external demand
and decelerating utilisation of domestic
resources. On 5 February 2004 Sveriges
Riksbank reduced the repo rate further by
0.25 percentage point in the context of expectedlower domestic and international cost
pressures. The spread between short-term
market interest rates in Sweden and the euro
area was broadly stable in the first half of 2003,
at around 100 basis points, although it declined

reflected developments in international bondmarkets, and the differential with the euro area
widened slightly to stand at around 50 basis
points at the end of 2003. The krona fluctuated

around SEK 9.2 per euro until September 2003,before strengthening somewhat to aroundSEK 9 per euro. These developments possibly
stemmed from receding uncertainty following

the outcome of the referendum of
14 September on the adoption of the euro and
the fact that the outlook for growth remainedrelatively favourable.UNITED KINGDOMAverage real GDP growth in the United
Kingdom picked up in 2003, rising to 2.3%,compared with 1.7% in 2002 (see Table 11). In
early 2003 the economy was affected by
uncertainty associated with the conflict in the
Middle East, high oil prices and volatility in
financial markets, which underminedconfidence. Later in 2003 these uncertaintiesdiminished and financial markets started to
recover, supporting a pick-up in economic
activity. As in previous years, growth was
driven mainly by domestic demand, whereas netforeign trade made a negative contribution toreal GDP growth.Growth in real household consumption easedto 2.9% in 2003 as a result of reduced gains in
real disposable income, moderating house price
increases and slower rises in household wealth.At the same time, credit growth was strong and
the housing market remained more resilient than
had been generally expected. Public spending

growth accelerated to 3.6%, up from 3.3% in
2002. Gross fixed capital formation increasedby 2.6%, somewhat more than in 2002.Business investment was held back by financial
restructuring in the corporate sector and by
the fact that there was little sign of pressures
on physical capacity. Notwithstanding the
improvement in price competitiveness, the70ECBAnnualReport
2003decline in exports seen in 2002 continued in2003, with exports falling by 0.5%. This
decline was associated with sluggish foreign
demand. Despite a slowdown in import growth
in 2003, foreign trade made a negative
contribution to real GDP growth for the eighthyear in a row. The labour market proved rather
resilient, with unemployment remaining broadly
flat at 5.0%. Total employment expanded at a
rate similar to that recorded in 2002, helped by a

strong increase in the number of jobs in the
public sector.Inflation pressures remained subdued in 2003.HICP inflation, which averaged 1.4% in 2003,
was broadly stable compared with the previous
year. RPIX inflation, which averaged 2.8% in
2003, was considerably higher than HICP
inflation, partly reflecting the inclusion of the
strongly increasing housing cost component in
the RPIX.10 Both domestic and external costpressures remained subdued in 2003. Annual

growth in unit labour costs in the economy as a
whole was somewhat higher than in theprevious year, although it remained moderate.
Import prices increased only slightly, despite
the depreciation of the pound during the first
half of the year.After recording a deficit of 1.6% of GDP in2002, the general government balancedeteriorated further, reaching 3.2% of GDP in
2003. This decline can be attributed mainly to
the expansionary fiscal stance reflecting high
primary public expenditure and shortfalls in
revenue related to changes in the composition ofGDP. As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratioincreased from 38.5% in 2002 to 39.8% in
2003. The updated Convergence Programme
targets budgetary deficits of 3.3% and 2.6% of
GDP in 2003/04 and 2004/05 respectively. The
gross debt ratio is expected to increase from39.3% of GDP in 2003/04 to 40.2% in2004/05.The Bank of England conducts monetary policywithin a flexible exchange rate regime with an
explicit and symmetric inflation target. In June2003 the government announced its decision topostpone a referendum on the adoption of theeuro, based on the evaluation of the Treasury™s
five economic tests, which concluded that there
was still insufficient convergence and
flexibility to cope with potential problemsinside EMU. To help ensure that inflationexpectations remain in line with those of the
euro area, the UK Government announced a
new inflation target in December 2003,
redefining it in terms of the HICP (referred to
as the CPI in the United Kingdom) instead ofthe previously used national RPIX index. Thenew inflation target is defined as a 12-month

increase of 2% in the HICP.
In 2003 the Bank of England changed itsofficial repo rate on three occasions. On both6 February and 10 July the rate was reducedby 0.25 percentage point, leaving it at 3.5%,
while on 6 November the rate was raised by
the same amount to 3.75%. On 5 February 2004

the repo rate was increased by 0.25 percentage
point to 4%. The decisions to raise the repo rate
were taken against the background of astrengthening economic outlook, strong creditgrowth and a resilient housing market. The
Bank of England expected these developments
to put gradual upward pressure on future

inflation. Both the short and long-term interest
rate differentials vis-à-vis the euro areaincreased in the course of 2003, reflecting therelatively rapid improvement in the economic
outlook and rising inflation expectations (see

Chart 27). Following a depreciation during the
first half of 2003, the pound™s exchange rate
against the euro fluctuated around GBP 0.70until the end of the year.10The RPIX is defined as the Retail Price Index excluding

20031.1MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS
One of the pivotal tasks carried out through the
Eurosystem is the implementation of themonetary policy of the euro area. For this
purpose the Eurosystem has at its disposal an

operational framework of monetary policy
instruments and procedures.1Based on an assessment of the liquidity
conditions in the market and the needs of the
banking sector, the ECB manages the liquidity
situation in the euro area through its main
refinancing operations (MROs), longer-term
refinancing operations (LTROs) and, where
necessary, its fine-tuning operations.
Counterparties can use the standing facilities
(i.e. the marginal lending facility and the

deposit facility) to obtain overnight liquidity
from, or make overnight deposits with, the
NCBs. The Eurosystem requires credit
institutions to hold minimum reserves onaccounts with the NCBs. All Eurosystem creditoperations have to be covered by adequate
collateral provided by counterparties. Due to

the importance of the money market for the
implementation of monetary policy, the
Eurosystem closely follows developments inthis market.2In 2003 the Eurosystem™s operationalframework for monetary policy continued to
function well, providing stable money market
conditions with low volatility for short-termmarket interest rates and a clear signalling ofthe monetary policy stance.ASSESSMENT OF THE LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS
The ECB™s liquidity management relies on the
daily assessment of the liquidity conditions inthe euro area banking system to determine theliquidity needs of the system and thus the
volume of liquidity to be allotted in the weekly
MROs, and potentially through the conduct of
other open market operations such as fine-
tuning and structural operations. The liquidityneeds of the banking system are defined by thesum of reserve requirements imposed on banks,
funds held in excess of these requirements on1MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS, FOREIGN
EXCHANGE OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENT
ACTIVITIEScredit institutions™ current accounts with theirNCBs (excess reserves) and autonomous
factors. The latter are a set of items on the
Eurosystem™s balance sheet which have an
impact on banks™ liquidity needs but are notunder the direct control of the liquiditymanagement of the ECB (e.g. banknotes in

circulation, government deposits and net
foreign assets).In 2003 the daily liquidity needs of the euroarea banking system amounted to 241.5 billionon average, an increase of 24% compared with
2002. On average, reserve requirements stood
at 130.9 billion, broadly unchanged comparedwith 2002. Excess reserves amounted to
0.7 billion, which was also similar to 2002.Autonomous factors, by contrast, increasedsubstantially, absorbing liquidity of 109.9billion, almost twice as much as in 2002 (see the
upper panel of Chart 28). This was the result of
the strong increase in banknotes in circulation,
which to a large extent still reflected the
catching-up process following the temporaryfall around the cash changeover.
To help credit institutions prepare their bids inthe MROs, the ECB continued to publish on the
announcement day of the weekly MRO a

forecast of the average autonomous factorscovering the period from the announcement dayto the day preceding the settlement of the
subsequent MRO. The absolute difference
between the forecast and the actual outcome
was, on average, 1.4 billion in 2003, comparedwith 1.8 billion in 2002 and 1.9 billionin 2001, providing some evidence of animprovement in forecasts over recent years.31A detailed description of the operational framework can be
found in the ECB publication entitled ﬁThe implementation of
monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on
Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and proceduresﬂ,
February 2004.2Money Market Study 2002, ECB, November 2003 and Money
Market Study 2003, ECB, January 2004.3Among the autonomous factors, government deposits held with
NCBs were the most volatile factor in 2003. The volatility of
these deposits, measured by the standard deviation of the daily
changes, amounted to 
4.2 billion, against 3.9 billion in 2002.The volatility of banknotes in circulation was 1.3 billion in2003, compared with 6.7 billion in 2002.75ECBAnnualReport

a weekly frequency and normally have amaturity of two weeks (from 9 March 2004 theyhave a maturity of one week; see the section

below on the review of the operational
framework). They play a pivotal role in steering
interest rates, managing the liquidity situation
in the market and signalling the stance ofmonetary policy through the level of theminimum bid rate. They also provide the bulk of
refinancing to the banking system.In 2003 the allotment volumes in MROs rangedfrom 38.0 billion to 150.0 billion, withan average volume of 95.9 billion. Theoutstanding liquidity provided through MROs
amounted on average to 194.4 billion, whichrepresented 81% of the overall net liquidity

supplied by the Eurosystem through open
market operations. As in 2002, MROs were
conducted as variable rate tenders with aminimum bid rate following the multiple rateauction procedure. According to this procedure,
the bids with the highest interest rate are
satisfied first until the pre-defined allotted
amount is exhausted. The lowest rate at which
funds are allotted is the marginal rate. Bids atthe marginal rate are allotted pro rata.4The marginal rate and the weighted average rateare usually higher than the minimum bid rate.
The average spread between the marginal rate
and the minimum bid rate was broadlyunchanged at 4.7 basis points, compared with4.8 basis points in 2002. The average spread
between the weighted average rate and the
marginal rate stood at 1.5 basis points,
compared with 1.4 basis points in 2002. Such
narrow spreads show the high degree ofhomogeneity and precision among creditinstitutions in forecasting the allotment
outcome as well as the tender rates. The
percentage of bids which were satisfied in each
MRO ranged between 36% and 100%,
averaging 74% over the period under review,compared with a range of 19% to 100% and anaverage of 60% in 2002.The Eurosystem™s operational framework formonetary policy was subject to only a fewepisodes of limited tension. These occurredmainly in relation to the three underbidding
episodes in which the total amount of bids
submitted by credit institutions fell short of the
amount needed by them to allow for a smooth

fulfilment of reserve requirements. On 3 Marchand 3 June 2003 underbidding occurredimmediately prior to Governing Council
meetings at which bidders expected a decision
to lower the key ECB interest rates. These cases
of underbidding resulted in tight liquidity
conditions which temporarily drove up short-term market interest rates. By contrast, theunderbidding episode of 25 November did not
occur in an environment of expectations of an
interest rate decrease. The underbidding came
as a surprise to the bidders themselves, as
revealed by the fact that the weighted average

rate was 2.02%, i.e. two basis points higher
than the marginal rate (which was equal to theminimum bid rate). If underbidding had been
widely expected by the market, bids would have
been clustered at the minimum bid rate, thus
resulting in a weighted average rate of 2.00%.Finally, over the summer, a relatively highspread between the EONIA (euro overnight
index average) and the minimum bid rate was
observed. In reaction to this, the ECB decided
to provide the banking system for some time
with slightly more liquidity than needed, whichhelped to bring the spread back down to more
normal levels in the autumn.LONGER-TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONS
The LTROs are liquidity-providing operations
with a monthly frequency and a maturityof normally three months. They provide
4The ﬁpro rataﬂ system works as follows: the total amount allotted
at the marginal rate is divided by the total amount of bids at the
marginal rate to give the percentage of bids satisfied. Each

individual bidder™s bid amount at the marginal rate is multiplied

by this percentage to obtain the amount it is allotted.
77ECBAnnualReport
2003counterparties 
with additional longer-termrefinancing. In contrast to the MROs, the

LTROs are not conducted with the intention of
steering the liquidity situation or signalling the
monetary policy stance. The Eurosystem acts as
a rate-taker since LTROs are conducted as purevariable rate tenders with a pre-announced
allotment volume. The Eurosystem conducted
12 LTROs in 2003, each having a
pre-announced allotment volume of 15 billion.In January 2004 the volume was increased to25 billion. On average in 2003, LTROsamounted to 19% of the total net liquidity

provided through open market operations. As in
previous years, the dispersion of bids in LTROs
was slightly higher than in MROs. On average
over the year, the weighted average rate
exceeded the marginal rate by 1.7 basis points,compared with 1.9 basis points in 2002. The

percentage of bids which were satisfied in each
LTRO in 2003 ranged between 42% and 60%,
averaging 51%, compared with a range of 36%

to 72%, averaging 50%, in 2002.OTHER OPERATIONS
On 23 May 2003 the Eurosystem conducted a
liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation in
order to restore balanced liquidity conditions.
The large recourse to the marginal lendingfacility on the preceding two days had led tolooser conditions on the last day of the
maintenance period and to a decline in the
overnight rate. The fine-tuning operation was
conducted as a collection of fixed-term deposits

with a fixed rate of 2.50% (which was theminimum bid rate in MROs at that time),overnight maturity and a pre-announced

intended allotment amount of 
5 billion. Ofmore than 100 eligible counterparties, 12
participated, and bids corresponded to an
amount of 3.9 billion, all of which wasallotted. The reserve maintenance period endedsmoothly with a small net recourse to the
deposit facility of 0.6 billion.STANDING FACILITIES
The two standing facilities offered by theEurosystem, i.e. the marginal lending facility
and the deposit facility, aim to provide and
absorb overnight liquidity, signal the generalstance of monetary policy and bound overnightmarket interest rates by setting an upper and a
lower limit for those rates. In 2003 the width of
the interest rate corridor determined by the two
standing facilities remained unchanged at 200
basis points, centred around the minimum bidrate of the MROs.There are normally two reasons for creditinstitutions to have recourse to the standing
facilities:ŒRecourse to standing facilities may arise in the
case of aggregate liquidity imbalances, i.e. if
the banking system as a whole has either too
little or too much liquidity relative to the
aggregate reserve requirements. Aggregate
recourse normally takes place only towards the
end of the maintenance period, when thebanking system must settle its position againstany accumulated aggregate liquidity
imbalances via recourse to the standing
facilities. The bigger spikes in the recourse to
standing facilities during 2003 shown in the
lower panel of Chart 28 mostly reflect theoffsetting of such aggregate imbalances.ŒUnexpected payment flows between
individual banks at the end of the day, when
the money market is no longer liquid, may

trigger individual recourse to the standingfacilities. Individual recourse is normally
spread fairly evenly across the maintenance
period. Individual recourse may become
substantial on days when payment system
components fail, such as on 3 July 2003,
when recourse to the marginal lendingfacility was 7.7 billion.In 2003 the total average daily recourse tothe marginal lending facility amounted to78ECBAnnualReport
2003269 million, while total average daily recourseto the deposit facility amounted to 242 million.On the assumption that the aggregate recourse
takes place on the last day of the maintenance
period while individual recourse takes place inthe remainder of the period, these amounts maybe broken down into 49 million aggregaterecourse and 221 million individual recoursefor the marginal lending facility, and 107million aggregate recourse and 135 millionindividual recourse for the deposit facility.Total recourse to the standing facilities in 2003
remained at the low levels of the previous year,
indicating the good quality of the forecasts of
the autonomous factors and the high efficiency
of the interbank market.PARTICIPATION OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS IN

MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS
The Eurosystem™s monetary policy framework
continued to enable a broad range of credit
institutions to participate in monetary policy
operations. Of the 6,593 euro area credit
institutions which were subject to minimumreserves at the end of 2003 (a change of -5%
compared with the previous year), 2,149 (-7%)
were eligible to participate in open market
operations, 3,083 (-5%) were eligible to use the
deposit facility and 2,629 (-8%) were eligible to
use the marginal lending facility.In 2003 the average number of creditinstitutions participating in the MROs and
LTROs continued the declining trend which had
started in mid-2000. In 2003 the averagenumber of bidders in the MROs was 267,
compared with 307 in 2002. Similarly, the
number of banks participating in the LTROs fell
from 186 in 2002 to 133 in 2003. This trend
seems to be the result of a combination of
various factors, such as the competitiveness ofthe interbank market, the consolidation of thebanking sector and the centralisation of treasury

management in banking groups. There is no

sign that this continuous decline in MRO and
LTRO participation has jeopardised the smooth
allocation of central bank liquidity within the
euro area banking system. The Eurosystemcontinued to have more counterparties in itsopen market operations than any other central
bank in the world.MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEMThe Eurosystem™s minimum reserve system
applies to credit institutions in the euro area and
primarily pursues the aims of stabilising money
market interest rates and creating (or enlarging)

a structural liquidity shortage. The reserve
requirement of each institution is determined inrelation to elements of its balance sheet. The
averaging provision, which allows credit
institutions to fulfil their reserve requirements
on average over the one-month reserve
maintenance period5, helps to dampen theimpact of temporary liquidity shocks on short-term interest rates.In 2003 reserve requirements represented 54%of the total liquidity needs of the euro area

banking system. The average level of aggregate
reserve requirements held by credit institutions
in the euro area was 130.9 billion in 2003,representing a small increase of around1 billion compared with 2002. Reserve
requirements ranged from 128.9 billion in
the maintenance period ending on 23 March 2003
to 132.1 billion in the maintenance periodending on 23 August 2003.Banks™ current account holdings coveringreserve requirements fluctuated between
89.1 billion and 181.2 billion in the course of
the year, indicating that a substantial further

buffer against unexpected aggregate liquiditywithdrawals was always available (see theupper panel of Chart 28). Mainly owing to the
averaging provision of the minimum reserve

system, and taking into account the low

frequency of open market operations, the
volatility of the EONIA continued to be low in2003 by international standards. The standarddeviation of daily changes in the EONIA was
14 basis points, 2 basis points higher than in
2002.5From 10 March 2004 a reserve maintenance period no longer
lasts one calendar month, but instead varies in length.79ECBAnnualReport
2003During 2003 an average of 19 cases of non-compliance with the obligation to hold minimum
reserves were reported per reserve maintenance
period, compared with 28 in 2002. The average
daily shortfall amounted to 6.7 million,compared with 10.5 million in 2002. 58% ofthe cases led to relatively small penalties of
below 500. There were, however, seven verylarge infringements, which led to fines in
excess of 10,000.REVIEW OF THE OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK
In reaction to some occasional disturbancesrecorded in previous years, the Governing
Council decided in January 2003 to amend some
of the features of the Eurosystem™s operational
framework with effect from March 2004:Œto modify the timing of the reserve
maintenance period so that it always starts on
the settlement day of the MRO following the
Governing Council meeting at which the

monthly assessment of the monetary policy
stance is scheduled. Furthermore, as arule, the implementation of changes tothe standing facility rates is aligned with
the start of the new reserve maintenance
period;Œto shorten the maturity of the MROs from
two weeks to one week.Combining both these measures will help to
remove market expectations of interest rate
changes during any given maintenance period,
given that changes in the key ECB interest rateswill only apply, in general, to the forthcomingreserve maintenance period and that liquidity
conditions will no longer spill over from one
reserve maintenance period to the next.
Consequently, within a maintenance period, the
market overnight rate should no longer beaffected by rate change expectations. Hence,given the generally neutral liquidity
management policy of the ECB, the overnight
rate should remain close to the minimum bid

rate. This should eventually prevent speculative
considerations from disrupting the bidding ofcredit institutions in MROs. The measures willthus help to stabilise the conditions in whichbidding takes place.Owing to technical and legal lead times, it was
decided that the changes would not enter intoforce until 10 March 2004.6 To help credit
institutions to achieve a smooth implementation
of the changes to the operational framework for
monetary policy, an extended transitional
minimum reserve maintenance period (from
24 January to 9 March 2004) was agreed.ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR MONETARY POLICY

OPERATIONS
The Statute of the ESCB requires that all
Eurosystem credit operations be covered by
adequate collateral. The collateral frameworkof the Eurosystem is designed to protect theEurosystem against incurring losses in its
monetary policy and payment systems
operations (see Box 7). It ensures the equal
treatment of counterparties and enhances
operational efficiency.In order to take account of existing differencesin the financial structure of euro area countries,
assets eligible for Eurosystem credit operations
include a large number of different instruments.
A distinction is made between two categories of
assets eligible for these credit operations: ﬁtieroneﬂ and ﬁtier twoﬂ. This distinction has nobearing on their eligibility for the various types
of Eurosystem monetary policy operations,

except that tier two assets are not normally
expected to be used by the Eurosystem in
outright transactions (not conducted at present).Tier one consists of marketable debtinstruments fulfilling uniform eligibility criteria
specified by the ECB. Tier two consists of
assets which are of particular importance for
national financial markets and banking systems
and for which eligibility criteria have beenestablished by the NCBs, subject to minimum6A new Regulation (ECB/2003/9) on the application of minimum
reserves was adopted on 12 September 2003 (OJ L 250,
2.10.2003, p. 10). A revised version of the document entitled

marketable debt instruments or they may beequities.A substantial part of tier one assets is made upof government securities (assets issued by
central, regional and local governments) and of
Pfandbrief-style securities which are issued bycredit institutions and backed by residentialmortgages or by public sector debt. At the end

of 2003 government and Pfandbrief-style
securities represented 57% and 31%
respectively of the total tier one assets. Other

types of asset included in tier one are privatesector securities (i.e. uncovered bonds issuedby credit institutions, bonds issued by
corporations and asset-backed securities other
than Pfandbrief-style securities) and securities
issued by international and supranational
institutions (which accounted for less than 2%at the end of 2003). In particular, the value of

eligible bonds issued by corporations followeda continuously increasing trend in 2003.Tier two consists of marketable assets andnon-marketable debt instruments such as bank
loans, trade bills and mortgage-backed promissory
notes listed by some NCBs in that category.The total value of tier one assets eligible ascollateral for Eurosystem credit operations was
7 trillion at the end of 2003, compared with
6.6 trillion at the end of 2002 (see Chart 29).Overall, tier one assets accounted for anoverwhelming proportion of eligible assets (96%at the end of 2003). The total value of marketable
tier two assets remained stable, standing at
261 billion at the end of 2003, compared with265 billion in 2002. (The absolute amount of eligiblenon-marketable tier two assets is not available.)All Eurosystem credit operations are based on
underlying assets provided by counterparties in81ECBAnnualReport
2003the form of either a transfer of ownership ofassets (earmarking system) or a pledge granted

over relevant assets (pooling system).The total value of marketable assets put forwardby counterparties as collateral for Eurosystem
credit operations was around 
750 billion at theend of 2003, compared with just over 700billion at the end of 2002 (see Chart 30).
7Overall, the share of debt instruments issued
by credit institutions in the total amount of
marketable assets put forward at the end of 2003

remained stable at 51%, compared with 52% at
the end of the previous year. Government
securities were similarly stable, standing at
around 38%. A continuously increasing path
was observed for the share of corporate bonds,
from 4% (end-2002) to 6% (end-2003). The
share of non-marketable bank loans has been
relatively stable at around 4% of all assets putforward during the past five years.Chart 30 Use of collateral in Eurosystem credit operations(end-of-month data; EUR billions)Source: ECB.Eurosystem counterparties may use eligibleassets on a cross-border basis, i.e. they can
obtain funds from the NCB of the country in
which they are established by making use ofassets located in another euro area country. The
share of cross-border collateral in total
collateral put forward by counterparties for
Eurosystem credit operations continued to
increase, from 33% at the end of 2002 to 40% atthe end of 2003. This increase involved alltypes of assets, but particularly those issued by
credit institutions and corporations (for more
details see Section 2.3 of this chapter).7The total amount of collateral deposited by counterparties in
pooling systems was around 650 billion (end-2003), comparedwith approximately 600 billion at the end of 2002. With regardto earmarking systems, where it is possible to identify the
individual transaction for which the underlying assets are used,
the total amount used by counterparties for Eurosystem credit
operations (monetary policy operations and intraday credit
needs) was 107 billion at the end of 2003, compared with 
115billion at the end of 2002.

2003Box 7RISK MANAGEMENT RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF CREDIT IN MONETARY POLICY AND PAYMENT
SYSTEMS OPERATIONS
In policy operations (i.e. monetary policy or payment systems credit operations), when the
Eurosystem enters into a transaction with a counterparty, it incurs the risk that the counterparty
may be unable to meet its credit obligations. This credit risk is mitigated by the requirement that
the counterparty provide adequate collateral to guarantee the credit provided.The framework for managing the risks associated with the Eurosystem™s policy operations hasthree main components, namely the risk control of collateral, valuation principles and the credit
risk assessment of collateral.In the context of risk control of collateral, a new haircut schedule was finalised in 2003. The
new haircut schedule aims to better differentiate between collateral types on the basis of theirperceived liquidity risk characteristics. The classification of collateral into liquidity groups is

based on the examination of different liquidity indicators, such as yield curve differentials
between bonds issued by issuer groups of the same credit quality, effective supply and average
issue size as well as the bid-ask spread type of indicators. The classification of issuer segments

into groups of varying levels of liquidity is then reflected in the level of risk controls orhaircuts.The new tier one risk controls apply as of March 2004. The main changes are as follows:

ŒTier one assets are classified in four liquidity categories and each category is assigned a
specific haircut schedule:Category ICat

corporate and otherissuersSupranational debtinstrumentsŒThe maturity sectors of the haircut schedules have been chosen in such a way as to achieve an
even distribution of outstanding volumes across sectors. The new maturity sectors are0-1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years, 5-7 years, 7-10 years and >10 years. The application of initial

margins has been discontinued and trigger levels used in margin calls reduced from 1.0% to

0.5%. In order to guarantee coherence between the new valuation haircut schedules for tier83ECBAnnualReport
2003one eligible assets and those for tier two eligible assets, the latter have also been modified totake into account both the discontinuation of initial margins and the new maturity sectors.ŒThe valuation haircuts applied to tier two assets reflect the specific risks associated with
these assets and are at least as stringent as the haircuts applied to tier one assets. The four
different haircut groups for tier two assets, reflecting differences in their intrinsic
characteristics and liquidity, have been maintained: equities, marketable debt instruments
with limited liquidity, debt instruments with restricted liquidity and special features, and
non-marketable debt instruments.The management and publication of the
complete list of assets eligible for Eurosystem
credit operations are handled centrally at the
ECB, where the Eligible Assets Database iskept. The NCBs submit information to the ECBon eligible assets issued in their respective
national markets. Assets are only considered
eligible for Eurosystem credit operations when
they appear in the list updated on a daily
basis on the ECB™s website (www.ecb.int). In
2003 the Eurosystem enhanced the quality,efficiency and reliability of the service providedto its counterparties and also modified the
content of the list of eligible assets, providing
additional information on the issuer group
and the asset types in line with the new risk
control framework applied from March 2004(see Box 7).THE SINGLE LIST OF COLLATERAL
During the first five years of Stage Threeof EMU, a large amount of collateral
encompassing a wide range of assets wasavailable to counterparties for collateralisingEurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit
operations. However, the heterogeneity of the
assets included in the tier two lists of different
euro area NCBs may not ensure a level playing-
field for counterparties and may somewhatdecrease the transparency of the collateralframework. The Eurosystem is therefore
investigating whether and how this
heterogeneity could be reduced and under what
conditions the two tiers of assets could be
merged in order to obtain a single list.In June 2003 the Eurosystem launched a public
consultation inviting market participants to
submit their views on possible changes to the
Eurosystem™s collateral framework. The basicidea put forward to market participants was togradually move from a two-tier system to a
single list. The assets already accepted as
collateral by the Eurosystem under tier one
would be part of the single list. The main
categories of currently eligible tier two assets
were reviewed with a view to their potentialinclusion in the single list. In addition, a newcategory of assets to be made eligible was
investigated, namely euro-denominated debt
instruments issued in the EEA by issuers
established in non-EEA G10 countries.Replies were received from various interestedparties, including individual banks,
associations of market participants and
some national and supranational banking
associations. Almost all replies supported the
proposal to replace the two-tier system with asingle list of eligible collateral. Support for thereform is largely based on the desire to
establish a harmonised collateral framework
that enhances the level playing-field between
eligible counterparties. Market participants
argued that the new collateral policy shouldfavour greater availability of eligible assetsbecause of the increased use of collateral in the
market, e.g. in secured lending and repo
markets, and for the purposes of Continuous
Linked Settlement (CLS) (see Section 4 of
Chapter 3). Some market participants84ECBAnnualReport
2003highlighted the need to make eligible in thewhole euro area all categories of assets
currently accepted in tier two by only some
NCBs. Some of them also mentioned additional
categories of assets that they would welcome aseligible (e.g. more ﬁforeignﬂ assets such as debtinstruments denominated in foreign currencies).The Eurosystem is aware that the revisedcollateral framework (if and when decided) will
require gradual implementation over a number
of years. This will be necessary in the light ofthe required adaptation of operational systems
and procedures, both of the Eurosystem™s
central banks and of counterparties, as well as
legislative adjustments to be made in some
countries.MARKET CONTACT GROUPS
The ECB continued to use the Money Market
Contact Group (MMCG) and the Foreign
Exchange Contact Group (FXCG), both
established in 1999, as well as the Operations

Managers Group (OMG), established in 2002,as fora for discussing market developments,structural market issues and trading practices as
well as operational issues related to money
market and foreign exchange settlement.
Among the issues discussed with market
participants in the MMCG in 2003 were thoserelated to the 2002 review of the euro moneymarket, the European repo market, the ACI
initiative on the Short-Term European Paper
(STEP) project (see Section 3 of Chapter 3) and
the ECB™s consultation on the Eurosystem™s
collateral framework. The FXCG discussedissues such as the progress of the recentlyestablished CLS, developments in e-commerce
and a possible review of market practices.1.2FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS
In 2003 the ECB did not conduct any
interventions in the foreign exchange market.The standing agreement between the ECB and
the IMF, signed in April 2001, to facilitate theinitiation of special drawing rights (SDR)transactions by the IMF on behalf of the ECBwith other SDR holders was activated on one
occasion in 2003.1.3INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENT
The aim of the management of the ECB™sforeign reserves is to ensure that, at any given
point in time, the ECB has an adequate amountof liquid resources at its disposal for anyforeign exchange intervention, if and when the
Governing Council decides that intervention is
necessary. Liquidity and security are therefore
the basic requirements for the investment of the
ECB™s foreign reserves. Subject to these
constraints, the ECB™s foreign reserves are
managed in such a way as to maximise their
return. A set of rules and procedures Œ known
as a Chinese wall Œ have been established to
prevent inside information, for instance
originating from the areas responsible
for monetary policy implementation, fromreaching the areas responsible for themanagement of the ECB™s foreign reserves and
own funds portfolio.
At the end of 2003 the ECB™s net foreignreserve assets amounted to 38.3 billion,compared with 43.2 billion at the end of 2002.The change in the size of the foreign reserve
portfolio during 2003 reflects the interest
income earned and the change in the market
value of the assets in the portfolio, as a result of

the depreciation of the US dollar. The ECB canmake further calls on the euro area NCBs™foreign reserve assets under the conditions
defined in secondary Community legislation8.The ECB™s foreign reserves mainly consist ofUS dollars but also include Japanese yen, goldand SDRs. The currency distribution, which isdefined by the Governing Council, is based

on optimal currency allocation studies and8Council Regulation (EC) No 1010/2000 of 8 May 2000
concerning further calls of foreign reserve assets by the

European Central Bank (OJ L 115, 16.5.2000, p. 2).85ECBAnnualReport
2003prospective operational needs, and theGoverning Council may change it when it
deems appropriate. In line with the Central
Bank Gold Agreement of 26 September 1999,
renewed on 8 March 2004, the ECB™s goldassets are not managed actively.OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENTThe subscribed capital and general accounting
reserve of the ECB form the basis of the ECB™s

own funds portfolio. The purpose of the ownfunds portfolio is to provide the ECB with areserve to meet possible losses. The objective
of portfolio management is to generate returns
over the long term in excess of the average main
refinancing rate of the ECB.At the end of 2003 the ECB™s own fundsportfolio amounted to 5.9 billion, comparedwith 5.6 billion at the end of 2002. The changein the size of the own funds portfolio during
2003 reflects the interest income earned and
the change in the market value of the assets in
the portfolio. In 2003 further possiblediversification opportunities were examinedwith the aim of improving the total return on the
own funds portfolio.
RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUESThe ECB™s risk management function measures,monitors and reports all risks resulting fromfinancial operations undertaken by the ECB
directly or by the 12 NCBs of the Eurosystem
on behalf of the ECB. The framework for
managing the risks associated with the
management of the ECB™s foreign reserves andthe ECB™s own funds has three key interrelatedcomponents: (i) risk management measurement
and compliance, (ii) the analysis and reporting
of investment performance and (iii) the

analytical framework for asset allocation.The ECB™s exposure to market, credit andliquidity risk is measured and compliance with
agreed limits verified on a daily basis. In 2003
no serious breaches occurred. The monitoring
of compliance in 2003 focused increasingly on
ensuring the correct liquidity profile ofinvestments. Liquidity limits for the ECB™sforeign reserves were formally introduced toensure that adequate amounts of assets are held
in cash or highly liquid securities. Clear
procedures are in place for reporting and
dealing with any breaches of these or otherlimits. 2003 also saw improvements to theprocedures to verify the accuracy of the daily
mark-to-market prices (the prices of securities,
recorded on a daily basis and used for valuation
purposes).The measurement and analysis of the
performance of all the relevant investment
portfolios forms a large part of the risk
management work. The current framework has

24 separate portfolios for foreign reserve
management alone, as each of the euro area
NCBs manages two portfolios of the ECB™sforeign reserves. Techniques to attribute

performance Œ i.e. to identify the sources of
portfolio returns in relation to the investment
benchmarks set by the ECB Œ were further
developed in 2003 in order to provide useful
feedback for portfolio managers. Aggregatingthese data over longer periods also allows more
detailed conclusions to be drawn. This analysis
of overall performance as well as the relative

performance of portfolios against the relevant
benchmark can also be useful for the decision-

making bodies in deciding on any modificationof the overall investment framework.Asset allocation is the process of dividinginvestments among different kinds of asset to
optimise, on the basis of the institution™s goals,
the trade-off between risk and reward. The keyfactor influencing the return on the investmentportfolios is the asset allocation of the ECB™s
strategic benchmarks. These are designed to
reflect the ECB™s long-term risk-return
preferences. In 2003 the ECB developed an
econometric model to derive expected returnsfor the setting of benchmarks. In addition,
several alternative optimisation techniques were
used to enhance the robustness of the analysis.
86ECBAnnualReport
2003The provision of payment and securitiessettlement facilities is one of the Eurosystem™s
main instruments for carrying out its task of

promoting the smooth operation of payment
systems. To fulfil its statutory task, the
Eurosystem has created the TARGET9 system, areal-time gross settlement (RTGS) system for
very large payments in euro. Payments through
TARGET are settled in the books of central
banks, in central bank money, which greatly
minimises the risk of failures with critical
systemic consequences for the entire financialsystem. TARGET has been subject toenhancements over the past few years, and
plans are under way to develop a second-
generation system, TARGET2.On the securities settlement side, theEurosystem and the market offer variouschannels to facilitate the use of collateral across
national borders. The use of these channels is
increasing with the growing integration of EU
markets.2.1THE TARGET SYSTEM
The present TARGET system is built on the 15
national payment systems of the EU. It also
includes the payment mechanism of the ECB,the EPM, and an interlinking mechanism thatenables the processing of cross-border

payments. In 2003 TARGET contributed
further to the integration of the euro money
market and, because the Eurosystem™s credit
operations are processed via this system,continued to play an important role in thesmooth implementation of the single monetary
policy. On account of its real-time settlement
service in central bank money and its broad

market coverage, the TARGET system attracts a
variety of other payments.TARGET functioned smoothly and successfullyin 2003, and continued its trend of settling
increasingly more large-value euro payments in
line with the Eurosystem™s policy objective to
promote settlement in central bank money. In2003 87% of the total turnover of large-value
2PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT
SYSTEMSpayments in euro was executed via TARGET.TARGET is available for all credit transfers in
euro between banks in an EU Member State
(intra-Member State traffic) and between banks
in different EU Member States (inter-MemberState traffic), including those that have not yetadopted the euro. In 2003 there were 3,351
participants in TARGET. 43,450 bank branches
worldwide can be addressed through TARGET.TARGET OPERATIONS
TARGET processed a daily average of 261,208
payments with a total value of 1,650 billion aday in 2003. Compared with 2002, this is an
increase of 3% in volume and 6% in value.
Out of the total TARGET traffic in 2003, inter-Member State traffic represented 33% in termsof value and 23% in terms of volume, compared

with 31% and 21% respectively in 2002. Of the

TARGET inter-Member State traffic, 95% in
terms of value and 52% in terms of volume were
interbank payments, the remainder being
customer payments. The average value of aninter-Member State interbank payment was17 million, and the average value of aninter-Member State customer payment was
0.8 million. Further information is providedin Table 12.In 2003 the overall availability of TARGET,i.e. the possibility for participants to use
TARGET during its business hours without
incident, reached 99.79%. The TARGET
Information System (TIS) was enhanced in
2003 so that TARGET users can be providedwith more detailed and timely information in the
event of an incident.9TARGET stands for Trans-European Automated Real-time
Gross settlement Express Transfer.

2003PROVISIONS FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT
PAYMENTS IN TARGET
Owing to the specific role the TARGET system
plays in the market and the broad market
coverage it provides, suitable protection against
a wide range of threats is essential forthe smooth functioning of the system.Consequently, security issues need to be
properly addressed within the TARGET
environment. A methodology for assessing the
risk situation has been in place since the
development phase of the TARGET system. In2003 the existing risk management process wasrevised substantially. The new TARGET Risk

Management Framework is based on
international standards.In abnormal circumstances it is of utmostimportance that systemically importantpayments, i.e. those that could cause a systemic

risk if not processed immediately, be carried
out without delay. Established TARGET
contingency measures have been further
enhanced to ensure that this is the case. In 2003a number of trials among central banks(sometimes involving commercial banks)verified the operability and interoperability of

all contingency measures alongside the whole
TARGET payment processing chain.As a result, the Eurosystem is today betterpositioned to ensure that payment systems and
financial markets can continue to function
smoothly in a crisis situation.OTHER CHANGESChanges in the communication network of
SWIFT, such as the SWIFTNet FIN migration,
are mandatory for the entire user community.
The components of TARGET may implement
the changes at their own pace, but must have
completed the changeover by the end of 2004.
NIGHT-TIME SETTLEMENT FACILITIES
In 2003 the Eurosystem responded to a market

move in securities settlement systems (SSSs)
towards settling transfers of financial
instruments during the night, in what are known
as overnight settlement cycles. In thesesettlement cycles, SSS operators bring forwardto the previous night some of the activities that
would typically occur on the following business
day. However, the value date for those trades is
the following business day. Overnight

settlement has the advantage that SSSparticipants can have certainty with regard totheir actual positions in cash and securities, and
can operate on this basis at the start of daytime
operations.Meeting a specific market request, theGoverning Council has approved a model which
supports the cross-border settlement of the
payment legs of overnight settlement cycles in
central bank money for participants established
outside the country of the system in which they
participate. The model would be implementedonly by interested NCBs on a voluntary basis.The solution developed by the Eurosystem

relies on bilateral guarantees between euro area
central banks. These guarantees involve the
NCB of the country where the system is located
and the NCBs of participants who areestablished outside that country. The bilateralChangeVolume20022003(%)

OPERATORS OF OTHER CURRENCY AREAS
The ESCB maintains close relations with
TARGET users so as to ensure that their needs
are given due consideration and receive anappropriate response. As in previous years,regular meetings were held in 2003 between the
EU central banks and the national TARGET
user groups. In addition, joint meetings of the
TARGET Management Working Group
(TMWG) of the ESCB and the TARGETWorking Group (TWG) of the Europeanbanking industry were held to discuss TARGET
operational issues. Strategic issues were
addressed in the Contact Group on Euro
Payments Strategy (COGEPS), a forum in
which the senior management of commercial
and central banks is represented.The Eurosystem, as operator of one of the
largest RTGS systems in the world, maintains
close contacts with the RTGS operators of other
currency areas. Increasing interrelations,
e.g. due to Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS)operations, have created the need for commondiscussions on operational issues.2.2TARGET2
The current structure of TARGET was decided

on in 1994 and was based on the principles of
minimum harmonisation and interconnection of
existing infrastructures. This was the best way
of ensuring that the system would be
operational from the very start of EMU.However, in view of increasing financialintegration within the euro area and the fact that
the business needs of TARGET users are
becoming even more similar, the system needs
to be enhanced.On 24 October 2002 the Governing Council setout the principles which have since guided the
preparation of the TARGET2 system. The new

system must (i) provide an extensively
harmonised service level, (ii) apply a singleTARGET-wide price structure to theseharmonised services and (iii) guarantee cost-
effectiveness. At the same time, the NCBs will
remain responsible for the accounts of, and
business relations with, credit institutions in

their respective Member States. As regards thetechnical infrastructure of TARGET2, central
banks will be able to share a technical platform,
the single shared platform (SSP), supporting
the RTGS services that they offer to their
banks.The planning for the TARGET2 project isdivided into three main phases: the pre-project
phase, the project phase, and the testing and
trial operations phase. 2003 was dedicated to
the pre-project phase, in which three main work

streams have to be addressed before technical
development work can start in the course of2004. The first work stream is the definition ofthe core features and functions offered by
TARGET2 (e.g. payment processing and
settlement services, interface issues, liquidity
management, information services, business
continuity and security). The second workstream on cost and pricing issues consistsmainly of the finalisation of a common cost
methodology for TARGET2. The third work
stream focuses on issues specifically related to
the SSP.As a first step in the definition of the core
features and functions of TARGET2, the
Eurosystem launched a public consultation in
December 2002 to collect the views of the entire
community of TARGET users on the approach

to be chosen for TARGET2 as well as on itsservice level.10 A summary of all replies,
together with the individual contributions, was
made available on the ECB™s website on 14 July
2003.11 All respondents welcomed the

2003Eurosystem™s initiative to improve thefunctionality and performance of TARGET. The
banking industry also stressed the importance
of users being involved in the TARGET2
project.The ESCB will continue to consult the bankingcommunity on relevant TARGET2 issues
throughout the project. In addition, the
contributions received in the public
consultation have served as a basis fordetermining the features and functions ofTARGET2. Current preparations are also
focused on ensuring the full compliance of the
future TARGET2 system with the Core

Principles for Systemically Important Payment

Systems12, which were adopted as minimumstandards by the Governing Council.With regard to the second work stream, acommon cost methodology for TARGET2 to be
applied by all central banks had to be
developed. It will serve as the basis for the
determination of the single TARGET2-wideprice structure and will also be used to establishwhether the cost recovery requirement has been
complied with.
As for the third work stream, which focuses onissues related to the SSP, the ECB hascoordinated the discussions between the centralbanks interested in participating in the SSP. The
Eurosystem has started to address issues related
to the governance structure and financing of the
SSP. The Banca d™Italia, the Banque de France
and the Deutsche Bundesbank have launched ajoint initiative for the development of the SSP.In addition to these three work streams, anadequate project organisation will have to be
established in 2004 to ensure both the effective
organisation of the development work in theproject phase and an appropriate level ofinvolvement of, and control by, all central

banks that intend to participate in the SSP.
Preparations at the ESCB level aim to start
TARGET2 operations on 2 January 2007.
However, this deadline is very tight and will be
subject to a further feasibility analysis at a laterstage in the pre-project phase.2.3USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS ACROSS NATIONAL
BORDERSEligible assets may be used across nationalborders to collateralise all types of Eurosystem
credit operations by means of the correspondent
central banking model (CCBM) or througheligible links between EU SSSs. The CCBM isprovided by the Eurosystem, while eligible
links are a market-led solution.
The amount of cross-border collateral held bythe Eurosystem increased from 
234 billion inDecember 2002 to 305 billion in December2003. Overall, at the end of 2003 cross-border
collateral represented 40% of the total collateral

provided to the Eurosystem. This is a clear
indication of the increasing integration of
financial markets in the euro area. As a result of
this process, counterparties are increasinglyinclined to hold in their portfolio assets locatedin another euro area country.THE CORRESPONDENT CENTRAL BANKING MODELThe CCBM has remained the main channel
for transferring cross-border collateral andhas been enhanced further. Eurosystemcounterparties may use eligible assets on a
cross-border basis, i.e. they can obtain funds
from the NCB of the country in which they are
established by making use of assets located
in another euro area country.13 The CCBMaccounted for 34% of the total collateralprovided to the Eurosystem. Assets held in
custody through the CCBM increased from
195 billion at the end of 2002 to 259 billion at
the end of 2003.12Report of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems on

2003In order to improve the service level providedby the CCBM, the Governing Council decided
at the end of 2002 that, as of January 2004,
NCBs would perform internal CCBM
procedures within an hour, provided that
counterparties (and their custodians) submit
their instructions correctly. However, deviationBox 8BEST PRACTICES FOR MARKET PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN CCBM OPERATIONS AS AGREED BY THE

EUROPEAN BANKING FEDERATION, THE EUROPEAN SAVINGS BANK GROUP AND THE EUROPEAN

ASSOCIATION OF CO-OPERATIVE BANKS
1.Custodians shall ensure that their customers are informed of their rules/procedures for
CCBM-related instructions. These rules/procedures shall be based, to the largest extent
possible, on the official local market practices. Customers must abide by these rules/
procedures to ensure a swift and efficient processing of their instructions.2.Whenever possible, the processing of CCBM instructions should rely on automatic
procedures. In this respect, electronic communication channels between custodians and their

customers shall be used to the largest extent possible and instructions shall be based on ISO
15022 standards.3.Under normal circumstances and on a best effort basis, custodians shall submit their
customers™ CCBM-related instructions to the local SSS within 30 minutes of their receiptprovided that the instructions are complete and correct, and that the customer has the
securities to be delivered.4.Custodian deadlines for same-day processing of their customers™ CCBM-related instructions
shall be 30 minutes before the deadline of the relevant local SSS (see the regularly updated

country tables on the ECB™s website at http://www.ecb.int). However, as good practice,customers are encouraged to submit their instructions well in advance of the custodian™sdeadline in order to avoid building up instruction queues and to provide the custodian with
sufficient time to react to mistakes or unforeseen problems.5.Market participants shall ensure that information is readily available to their customers to
enable them to monitor the status of their CCBM instructions.6.Custodians shall agree with their customers on solutions for recognising and prioritising
(when necessary) CCBM-related instructions. These solutions should be based on ISO

domestic collateral. 66 links are currently
available to counterparties, of which only a
limited number are actively used. Furthermore,
these links only cover part of the euro area, and no
new links were presented for assessment in 2003.Collateral held through links increased from 38billion in December 2002 to 46 billion inDecember 2003, but represented only 6% of the

20033.1THE CIRCULATION OF EURO BANKNOTES
AND COINS AND THE HANDLING OF
CURRENCYDEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINSThe substantial increase in euro banknotes in
circulation which was observed throughout2002 after the initial cash changeover periodcontinued during 2003. Between January and
December 2003, the value of euro banknotes in

circulation increased by 21.7%, from 358.5billion to 436.2 billion. Only in January 2003did the value of euro banknotes in circulationdecrease markedly, by 5.3% compared withDecember 2002, due to the reduced cash needs
of economic agents after the turn of the year in
line with the normal annual cycle. In February
the value of euro banknotes in circulation
picked up again, rising constantly at an averagemonthly growth rate of around 2.1% during therest of the year. The increase in demand for euro
banknotes is a result of their increased use both

as a store of value and as a parallel currency in
countries outside the euro area. Statistical
analyses have revealed that as at end-December2003 some 9% of the value of euro banknotes in
circulation was held by non-euro area residents.The number of euro banknotes in circulation alsorose markedly, by 10.1%, in 2003. Following a
drop of 8.6%, from 8.2 billion to 7.5 billionbanknotes, in January 2003, the number rose3BANKNOTES AND COINS
moderately throughout the year, with seasonalpeaks around the summer and towards the end of
the year, when a level of 9.0 billion banknotes
was reached. Chart 32 shows the development of
national banknotes and euro banknotes incirculation in terms of value from 2000 to 2003,
while Chart 33 shows the development in terms of
volume in 2002 and 2003.No significant shifts between individualbanknote denominations occurred in 2003, as canbe seen in Chart 34. A closer look at thedevelopment of the annual growth rates for the

individual denominations reveals significant
growth for the higher banknote denominations.

The increase in the issuance of 500 banknoteswas strongest, with the number in circulationrising from 167 million to 238 million in 2003, anannual growth rate of 42.5%. The number of 50,100 and 200 banknotes in circulation alsoincreased significantly, with annual growth rates
of 19.0%, 20.3% and 12.1% respectively, while
the increase in the lower-value banknotes was
moderate: 2.3% for the 
5 banknote, 2.5% for the10 banknote and 4.0% for the 20 banknote.A lasting upswing in the demand for euro coinswas observed in all euro area countries from
January 2003 onwards, resulting in an increase

in the value of coins in circulation of 13.7%,from 12.4 billion to 14.1 billion as atend-December 2003. The number of coins in

2003circulation increased by 9.1 billion in the courseof the year, from 39.9 billion to 49.0 billion

coins by the end of 2003. The significant rise
was mainly due to the increased demand for
low-value coins, i.e. 1 cent, 2 cent and 5 centcoins, which accounted for more than two-thirds of this increase. This can be explained by
hoarding and the relatively high loss rates for
these denominations.BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEM
Banknotes returned to the NCBs are fully
authenticated and quality checked with
sophisticated banknote-processing machines to
establish whether they are fit for further use.
Between January and December 2003 the
number of euro banknotes crossing NCBs™counters totalled 57.8 billion, with a face valueof 1,744 billion, consisting of 28.5 billionbanknotes deposited and 29.3 billion withdrawn
by credit institutions and other clients. Some
2.7 billion banknotes needed to be destroyed
because they were unfit for further use. Thisproportion is generally in line with NCBs™
experience with the legacy banknotes after a
similar period from their launch.3.2DEVELOPMENTS IN EURO BANKNOTE
COUNTERFEITS AND COUNTERFEIT
DETERRENCEEURO BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITSIn 2002, when the euro banknotes were new, thelevel of counterfeiting was exceptionally low.
This was partly because of the sophisticated
security elements in the euro banknotes, but
also because counterfeiters had not had much time
to adjust to the new banknotes. In 2003, thebanknotes™ second year of use, the number ofcounterfeits detected was inevitably higher
than in the previous year. The total number of
counterfeits received by National Analysis
Centres (NACs)15 during 2003 was 551,287. The
euro remains a well protected currency. However,the reproduction technology available tocounterfeiters gets better and cheaper over time.
In addition, the euro is a widely used international
currency, which makes it more prone to
counterfeiting. Overall, the counterfeiting rate did
not show a steady increase in 2003, but there weresome seasonal fluctuations coinciding withperiods of high circulation of genuine banknotes,
namely the Christmas and summer holiday
seasons.15Centres established in each EU Member State for the initial

BANKNOTESSecurity features ﬁageﬂ from the moment of

issue. As counterfeiters™ awareness of an

initially sound security feature increases, sodoes the risk of that feature being reproduced.The euro, as other world currencies,
experienced this phenomenon after its launch
and increasingly during 2003. This threat
increases as other banknote design authorities
adopt the euro as a technical standard and optfor similar security features. Therefore, the
research and development (R&D) of new
security features play an important role in
ensuring the future integrity of euro banknotes.

In the pursuit of new security features that

represent a paradigm change in the longer term,the Eurosystem has developed a methodology to
assess and fund R&D proposals on the widest
possible basis. The research on new security
features is supplemented by development
programmes that bridge the gap between
research and production.3.3BANKNOTE ISSUANCE AND PRODUCTION
THE EUROSYSTEM™S ROLE IN THE CASH CYCLE
The Governing Council has on variousoccasions underlined the importance of a levelplaying-field for cash services. A number ofmeasures have already been taken with a view to
contributing to a fair competitive environment.
In 2002 a common Eurosystem fee policy was

implemented for the cash transactions of
professional clients at NCB counters and acommon approach to opening hours anddebiting/crediting rules for cash services at
NCB counters was also defined. In addition,
terms of reference for the use of cash-recycling
machines16 in the euro area were published. In
2003 a common procedure for testing suchmachines was established. Tests conducted
according to this common procedure at any euro
area NCB are valid in all euro area countries.

away from the 50 towards the 20 banknote.The media have drawn attention to the existenceof high-quality counterfeits, but the number ofsuch counterfeits is extremely small and theﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ test for counterfeits remains
sufficient to detect almost all cases.COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCEIn addition to the cooperation agreement
concluded with Europol during 2002, the ECBconcluded similar agreements in 2003 with
Interpol and with several acceding country
central banks (ACCBs). The ECB and the NCBs
have also been active in training cash-handling
professionals, both in the EU and beyond,
in recognising and handling counterfeitbanknotes.The Counterfeit Analysis Centre at the ECB andthe NACs collaborate with the police in the
fight against counterfeiting, and technicians
from the NACs provide, upon request, legal
authorities with expert advice and technicalreports.Furthermore, the Eurosystem has increased its
contribution to the global cooperation on

counterfeit deterrence under the auspices of the
G10 governors. The ECB has developed atechnical support structure called the
ﬁInternational Counterfeit Deterrence Centreﬂ
(ICDC) for the international community. The

ICDC updates the threat analysis through
continuous evaluation of new reproductionequipment and counterfeit deterrence systems.

2003machines concerning the retention ofcounterfeit/suspected banknotes and the
separation of unfit banknotes in order to

contribute to the high quality of the banknotes
in circulation. Due attention has also been paidto the feasibility and technical capabilities ofsuch machines. Several manufacturers have
already successfully completed these tests, thus

contributing to high standards for banknote
processing and recycling. In addition to the
measures already in place, the Eurosystemcontinues to discuss further aspects of the cash
cycle with the objective of ensuring a smooth

and efficient supply of cash and maintaining the
integrity of the euro banknotes.The ECB and the European Commission jointlyorganise biannual meetings in which matters ofinterest related to the use of cash are addressed.
Participants include representatives from the

banking industry, from consumer and retail

groups, as well as from the vending-machine
and cash-in-transit industries. The ECB also
participates, as an observer, in the CashWorking Group under the umbrella of theEuropean Payments Council, which has been
established by the European Credit Sector
Associations and the major banks.PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTS AND FUTUREBANKNOTE PRODUCTIONIn April 2001 the Governing Council decidedthat in the following few years production of

euro banknotes would take place in accordance
with a decentralised production scenario with
pooling. This means that each euro area NCB isresponsible for the procurement of an allocatedshare of the total requirement for selected
denominations. Table 13 gives an overview of
the allocation of the production to the NCBs
according to this model.The total production requirements for 2003amounted to 3.1 billion banknotes (4.8 billion
in 2002).Significant work has been undertaken todevelop a future banknote procurement policy.The Governing Council has carried out athorough analysis of whether tender proceduresmight be applied in the medium term for the
procurement of raw materials and the
production of euro banknotes. The Governing
Council has decided that a common Eurosystem
competitive approach with tendering will be

fully implemented by 2012 at the latest. The

NCBs with in-house/public printing works will
be allowed to opt out of this common approach.SUPPORT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF EURO COINS
The Member States are responsible for theproduction of euro coins. The ECB continued to
act as an independent assessor of the quality ofminted coins. This included the continued
support and maintenance of a common quality
management system in all mints producing euro
coins. The production of coins in 2003 was
4.8 billion (6.2 billion in 2002).
SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTESThe main aim of upgrading currency designs is
to keep pace with technical developments in
order to make sure that the banknotes have a

continually high level of protection against

counterfeiting, while containing securityfeatures that the public can recognise.Banknote-issuing authorities therefore tend to
gradually upgrade banknotes after a few years
of circulation. In line with this practice, the
ECB has started planning a second series of
euro banknotes, which will take several years toproduce and issue.DenominationQ

96ECBAnnualReport
2003An issue date for the second series of eurobanknotes has not yet been defined, but it is
expected to be towards the end of this decade.
The banknotes will be issued denomination by
denomination, with certain intervals betweenreleases, so that it will take several years beforeall denominations have been introduced. The
design of the second series will be based on the
ﬁages and stylesﬂ theme of the current series in

order to signal continuity.VERY LOW-DENOMINATION BANKNOTES
Since the completion of the cash changeover,
there have been suggestions that it would be
useful to introduce very low-denomination
banknotes, i.e. of 
1 and/or 2. It has beenargued that in some countries the populationwas accustomed to using low-value banknotes
with their former currencies and has found it
difficult to adapt to the comparably high

banknote/coin boundary between the 2 coinand 5 banknote. It has also been argued thatconsumers tend to associate coins with low
values.The Governing Council has agreed to reassess
the possible issuance of very low-denomination
banknotes in autumn 2004, when more
experience regarding the use of euro banknotes
and coins has been gained, both inside andoutside the euro area.97ECBAnnualReport
2003The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, collects a widerange of statistics which enable the ESCB to
fulfil its tasks. As in previous years, the
provision of statistics proceeded smoothly in

2003. However, the ECB and the NCBsconsider that further improvements of the
statistics are still necessary.In 2003 numerous efforts were made to improvethe availability and quality of statistics for
the euro area, while aiming to minimise thereporting burden on reporting entities. Progresshas also been made with regard to the statistics
which are used intensively by the ECB and
which are collected and compiled by the
European Commission (Eurostat) and the
national statistical institutes (NSIs).
4.1NEW STATISTICS
In December 2003 the ECB published new
harmonised statistics on the interest rates of
monetary financial institutions (MFIs). Thesenew statistics cover 45 indicators of euro areainterest rates applied by MFIs to their deposit
and lending business vis-à-vis households and
non-financial corporations (see also Section 2.1
of Chapter 1). The monthly interest rate
statistics cover both outstanding amounts andnew business. They provide a comprehensiveand harmonised picture of the level of interest
rates applied by MFIs, how they change over
time and the business volumes associated with
these rates. The requirements for MFI interest
rate statistics are laid down in Regulation ECB/2001/18. All information, including the manualon MFI interest rates and methodological notes,
is available on the ECB™s website.
Since September 2003 the ECB has publishedadditional details on monetary aggregates andtheir counterparts. Seasonally adjustedestimates now cover the whole consolidated
balance sheet of the MFI sector. In addition, the
frequency of the data on the sectoral breakdown
of deposits, loans and holdings of securities
was increased from quarterly to monthly.Revaluations of selected MFI balance sheet
4NEW AND IMPROVED STATISTICS
items, e.g. write-offs/write-downs of loans,used in the calculation of the credit counterpart
to the monetary aggregates are now available
separately on a harmonised basis.Following the adoption of GuidelineECB/2002/7 on the statistical reporting
requirements of the ECB in the field of

quarterly financial accounts in 2002,
supplementary data on both the transactions and
the balance sheets of insurance corporationsand pension funds have been made available tothe ECB since February 2003.In the field of statistics on non-MFIs other thaninsurance corporations and pension funds, data
on the balance sheets of investment funds,including a detailed breakdown by type, werepublished for the first time in January 2003.
These quarterly statistics are compiled on the
basis of data currently available at the national
level and are not yet fully harmonised across the
euro area. In addition, since January 2003
monthly data on quoted shares issued by euroarea residents, broken down by issuing sector,have been made available. An improved method
for the calculation of growth rates for debt
securities has also been used since January
2003.For euro area statistics compiled by Eurostat,the most important new statistics were the first
publication of GDP flash estimates, based on a
sub-set of countries producing early estimates,

and of industrial new order statistics.As part of the further integration of statistics,the ECB published for the first time in

June 2003 the monetary presentation of the
balance of payments (b.o.p.). The monetary

presentation provides an important link between

the transactions in the external counterparts ofM3 and those by non-MFIs in the b.o.p. Aschanges in the net external assets of the MFI
sector to a large extent reflect foreign
transactions of non-MFI euro area residents,
this new presentation enhances the consistency
between the monetary and the b.o.p. data. Inthis context, the collection of separate98ECBAnnualReport
2003information on loans and deposits within theother investment account will also make it

easier to monitor developments in the liquid
assets held abroad by the non-MFI sector.4.2THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY FOR
STATISTICS
In 2003 the ECB statistical work followed a
medium-term strategy to enhance statistics andimprove their integration and dissemination.Core elements of this strategy are:ŒPreparing and incorporating the data on
acceding countries, first as EU members and
in the future as members of the euro area.ŒCreating an integrated system of quarterly
financial and non-financial accounts for the
euro area and enhancing the conceptual and
numerical coherence of the data framework
used for economic and monetary analysis.
The quarterly system of accounts will be
compiled both for the whole euro areaeconomy and for various institutional
sectors.ŒFurther expanding ECB statistics. This
includes a Centralised Securities Database(CSDB) and a Financial Markets Database
for the euro area, which will support the
production of consistent and accurate
statistics on securities markets and financial
markets. The CSDB will also help to produce
more accurate portfolio investment figures inthe b.o.p. and international investmentposition (i.i.p.) statistics.ŒExtending the statistical framework for the
monitoring and analysis of financial
stability.ŒMonitoring and responding to financial
innovations and other developments with
potentially important implications for
statistics, such as the new International
Accounting Standards and the Basel CapitalAccord.ŒImproving the dissemination of statistics.
ŒPromoting timely and high-quality economic
data for the euro area, as compiled by
Eurostat on the basis of contributions by
NSIs, e.g. by implementing the ﬁfirst for
Europeﬂ principle, which encourages NSIs
to give priority to their contribution to area-
wide data, in particular the Principal
European Economic Indicators, and to a
better coordination of, for example, releasecalendars and revision policies.ŒActively participating in international
standard-setting fora, with the aim of
achieving greater consistency in basic data in
the different types of statistics collectedfrom companies.As a way of improving the dissemination ofstatistics, since August 2003 the ECB has
published a monthly Statistics Pocket Book,
which provides the most important, up-to-date

statistics on the euro area in a handy format.4.3IMPROVEMENTS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL AND
LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR STATISTICS
The ECB, together with the NCBs and incooperation with other European andinternational institutions, also works towards

the strengthening of the legal and institutional

framework for the collection, compilation and
dissemination of statistics.The ECB has updated the Guidelineconcerning certain statistical reporting
requirements of the ECB and the procedures for
reporting by the NCBs of statistical information
in the field of money and banking statistics
(published as Guideline ECB/2003/2). The ECBhas also updated the Regulation concerning
the provision of MFI balance sheet statistics
(published as Guideline ECB/2001/13) to cover

certain positions vis-à-vis the acceding

countries and their currencies as from their
accession on 1 May 2004. Furthermore, anupdate of the Guideline on b.o.p. and i.i.p.99ECBAnnualReport
2003statistics was published as Guideline  ECB/
2003/7 in May 2003. This update will further
improve these statistics at the euro area level by
providing, among other things, a more detailedgeographical and sectoral breakdown of the b.o.p.
flows and i.i.p. stocks.Regarding the institutional framework, inMarch 2003 the ECB and the European
Commission (Eurostat) signed an updated
Memorandum of Understanding on economicand financial statistics. It sets out theresponsibilities of, and cooperation between,
the two institutions, without prejudice to the
legal provisions laid down in Article 285 of the
Treaty and in Article 5 of the Statute of the
ESCB. The ECB continues to have primeresponsibility for money and banking statistics,including financial market statistics, whereas
the European Commission continues to have

prime responsibility for general economic
statistics. Responsibilities for b.o.p. statistics
continue to be shared. The ECB also has prime
responsibility for statistics on internationalreserves, the nominal and real effectiveexchange rates of the euro, and the quarterly
financial accounts for the euro area. Annual
accounts by institutional sector for the Member
States remain the prime responsibility of the
European Commission, while the developmentof quarterly non-financial accounts forinstitutional sectors and the statistical
infrastructure, such as seasonal adjustment and

data transmission standards, is a shared
responsibility.Moreover, in 2003 a joint Task Force of theECB and the European Commission (Eurostat)
identified elements that were most relevant for
the quality of b.o.p. statistics and developed
quantitative indicators to monitor quality. These
quantitative indicators for the euro area will beincorporated in an overall assessment of qualityand published in annual quality reports. Finally,
the ECB and the European Commission
(Eurostat) have closely cooperated in the
preparation of a list of monthly and quarterly
Principal European Economic Indicators thatshould become available for the euro area muchsooner than at present, based on more timelycontributions from Member States.100ECBAnnualReport
2003The goal of economic research at the ECB is to
provide a strong conceptual and empirical basis
for policy-making and to better communicate
policy to the markets and the public. High-quality
research is essential to ensure that the ECB is wellequipped to cope with the unprecedentedchallenges associated with conducting a single
monetary policy for a group of sovereign
countries. The most important task of economic
research within the Eurosystem is to increase
knowledge of the functioning of the euro areaeconomy and, more specifically, to providemodels, tools and analyses relevant to the conduct
of monetary policy and the fulfilment of other
tasks of the Eurosystem. An example of this

policy orientation is its role in the evaluation of

the ECB™s monetary policy strategy, where anumber of background studies served as input tothe Governing Council™s evaluation (see Box 1).
5.1RESEARCH TOPICS
The research agenda for 2003 can be brokendown into six fields: monetary policy strategy,rules and indicators; the transmission of
monetary policy; financial markets and

institutions; international economics and
finance; the macroeconomic modelling of the
euro area; and general economic and structuralissues. Most of the research is first presented inthe ECB™s Working Paper series and Œ to a more
limited extent Œ the ECB™s Occasional Paper
series, as well as at conferences and
workshops, before being published in academic
journals or books.17Chart 35 shows the growing volume of research

produced since 1999 and the high number of
papers already or soon to be published in
academic journals or books.18 Chart 36

5.2RESEARCH NETWORKS
In many instances, ECB research is conductedwithin the framework of organised networks.
These are groups of researchers jointly engagedin broad, multi-purpose projects. They may
include economists from the ECB, euro area

NCBs, other central banks and policy-making
organisations, and academics. The ECB

participates and provides coordination and
organisational support, alone or with otherinstitutions. In 2003 such research networks
were particularly active: for instance, the ECB

conducted research on capital markets and
financial integration in Europe together with the
Johann Wolfgang Goethe University™s Center
for Financial Studies in Frankfurt (see Box 10).A major project completed in 2003 was theEurosystem Monetary Transmission Network.
Launched in 1999 by the ECB and the euro area17For some descriptive statistics on the scope of the research

18The ECB Working Paper series comprises research work by ECB
staff and visitors. Papers by researchers not affiliated with the
ECB can also be released in the series to the extent that they have
been produced in the context of ECB-led research initiatives
and/or presented at research conferences/workshops organised

by the ECB.Chart 35 Release of ECB Working PapersSource: ECB.010

2003NCBs, it investigated how the single monetarypolicy affects the euro area economy. Theproject collected comprehensive evidence on the
transmission mechanism. Participants
conducted in-depth studies using both
macroeconometric and microeconometric data
with a focus on firm investment behaviour andon the role of banks in the transmissionprocess. It also included a comparison of the
transmission mechanism in the euro area and
that in the United States. Several articles in
journals and working papers resulted from the

project, and a book containing the completeresults was published in November 2003.19While the network conducted most of itsresearch using data covering the period before
the introduction of the euro, some of the follow-
up evidence was extended in 2003 to cover the
period since 1999.In 2003, in order to gain a better understandingof the dynamics of inflation in the euro area and
in the component countries, a Eurosystem
Inflation Persistence Network was created,
bringing together researchers from the ECB and
all euro area NCBs. A wide range of data isbeing used to study the phenomenon, including
individual and sectoral data on consumer andproducer prices, macroeconomic inflation rates
and survey results. The results are expected in

2004 and 2005.The Euro Area Business-Cycle Network,organised in collaboration with the Centre forEconomic Policy Research, provides a forum
for the study of the euro area business cycle. It
brings together researchers from academia,
central banks and other policy institutions. The
Network held two workshops in 2003, and theECB hosted the Network™s first conference inDecember 2003, on the main sources of
exogenous shocks for the G7 economies and the
euro area.20The International Wage Flexibility Project,sponsored by the ECB together with theInstitute for the Study of Labour (IZA) in Bonn

Special emphasis is placed on the comparabilityof methodologies and results. A panel sessionat the meeting of the American Economic
Association was organised in 2003. The final
conference will be held at the ECB in June
2004.5.3MACROECONOMETRIC MODELLING OF THE
EURO AREAEconometric models are used directly and
indirectly in the monetary policy decision-making process, for example in preparing themacroeconomic projections, the main results of
which are published twice a year in the Monthly
Bulletin.21 Furthermore, model-building has
been a catalyst for the development of new
statistical data. A major example is the Area-
Wide Model macroeconomic database, availableon the ECB™s website and widely used byresearchers worldwide.In 2003 both the ECB and the NCBs were veryactive in the area of econometric modelling. The
modelling framework for the euro areaencompasses, for example, traditionalmacroeconometric and time-series models as
well as state-of-the-art dynamic factor,
structural vector auto-regressive and stochastic
general equilibrium models. This line of work,

and the related cooperation, is now being
extended to cover the central banks of theacceding countries.5.4CONFERENCES AND VISITOR PROGRAMMES
As part of its broader commitment to a

continuous and active exchange with the
academic world, the ECB organises or co-
organises a number of conferences and
workshops related to its core interests. There
are at present two main recurring events. Thefirst is the ECB Central Banking Conference, anevent organised every two years on a topic ofparticular relevance to the ECB. This event
targets high-level participants from central
banks, international and European institutions,
and academic institutions, as well as membersof the financial press. The proceedings of theconference are published. The second recurring
event is the series of conferences of the
International Research Forum on Monetary

Policy. Co-organised with the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, theCenter for Financial Studies at the JohannWolfgang Goethe University (Frankfurt) and
the Center for German and European Studies at
Georgetown University (Washington D.C.,

United States), this initiative focuses on

research on monetary policy issues that arerelevant from a global perspective. The secondconference in the series took place in November

2003 on the premises of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System.22Interaction with visitors is an important channel
of external communication and collaboration for
ECB researchers. To foster interaction between
ECB staff and the international research
community, the ECB organises a Research

Visitors Programme which enables recognised
researchers working on topics of interest to the
ECB to spend a limited period of timeconducting research while hosted by theDirectorate General Research. Furthermore, in
2003 a number of colleagues from the ACCBs
presented their analytical and research work to
the ECB. On a junior level, the ECB continued
to offer outstanding students enrolled inpostgraduate courses at leading internationaluniversities the possibility to conduct part of
their research at the ECB (see Section 2 of
Chapter 8). Finally, external consultants advise
on selected issues and external speakers
contribute to the ECB™s extensive seminarprogramme.2321For more information on the projection exercise, see ﬁA guide

103ECBAnnualReport
20036.1COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITIONS OF
MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED

ACCESSPursuant to Article 237 (d) of the Treaty, theECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring thefulfilment by the 15 EU NCBs and the ECB of

their obligations under Articles 101 and 102 of

the Treaty and Council Regulations (EC) Nos
3603/93 and 3604/93. This task is performed by
the General Council of the ECB. Article 101
prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from
providing overdraft facilities or any other type
of credit facility to governments and
Community institutions or bodies, as well as
from purchasing debt instruments directly from

them. Article 102 prohibits any measure, notbased on prudential considerations, whichestablishes privileged access by governments
and Community institutions or bodies to
financial institutions. In parallel with the
General Council, the European Commission
monitors Member States™ compliance with the
above provisions.The General Council also monitors the EUcentral banks™ secondary market purchases of
debt instruments issued by both the domestic
public sector and the public sector of other
Member States. According to the recitals ofCouncil Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, theacquisition of public sector debt instruments in
the secondary market must not be used to
circumvent the objective of Article 101 of the
Treaty. Such purchases should not become a
form of indirect monetary financing of thepublic sector.In 2003 the General Council found two cases ofnon-compliance with the above Treaty
requirements and the associated Council
Regulations by NCBs of Member States. In
both cases, the amount of coins held by the
NCBs and credited to the public sector exceeded
the limit of 10% of coins in circulation, as laid

down in Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC)
No 3603/93. In the context of the strong
inflows of coins to NCBs prior to theintroduction of euro coins on 1 January 2002,6OTHER TASKS AND ACTIVITIES
Finland exceeded the limit from October 2001and France from January 2002. In the case of
France, the limit continued to be exceeded until

April 2003, while in the case of Finland, the
situation was only remedied in December 2003.Thus, at the end of 2003, the situation had beenfully corrected in both countries.6.2ADVISORY FUNCTIONS
Article 105 (4) of the Treaty and Article 4 of the
Statute of the ESCB require that the ECB be
consulted by the relevant Community institution
and the responsible national authorities,
24 as
appropriate, on any proposed Community or

national legislation which falls within theECB™s fields of competence. The limits andconditions applicable to the consultation of the
ECB by national authorities in respect of draft
legislation are set out in Council Decision
98/415/EC of 29 June 1998.
25 All ECB opinions
are published on the ECB™s website.26In total, 32 consultations were initiated in 2003,

21 by a national authority and 11 by the EU
Council. Of these 32, two concerned means of
payment, four statistics and 11 rules which
could influence the stability of financial

institutions and markets. Three opinionsadopted in accordance with Article 105 (4) ofthe Treaty warrant specific mention: one on the
proposal for an EU directive on investment
services and regulated markets, which is
presented in more detail in Section 2 of
Chapter 3, and the other two on the Finnish24In accordance with the Protocol on certain provisions relating to
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as
annexed to the Treaty, Article 105 (4) of the Treaty and Article

4 of the Statute of the ESCB shall not apply to the United

Kingdom. Hence, the obligation to consult the ECB does not
extend to the national authorities of the United Kingdom.
25Article 2 of this Decision elaborates the specific areas in which
the ECB is to be consulted.26In 2002 the Governing Council endorsed a disclosure policy
entailing that, as a general rule, all ECB opinions issued upon the

request of national authorities would be published on the ECB™s

website in the languages of adoption (i.e. both English and the
language of the respective consulting authority) six months after

their adoption, unless they were of policy relevance, in which
case they would be made publicly available immediately after
adoption.104ECBAnnualReport
2003Government™s draft proposals to amend theSuomen Pankki Act.The proposal to amend the Suomen Pankki Act,on which the ECB delivered its first opinion,27suggested limiting Suomen Pankki™s ability to
make financial provisions. It further suggested
transferring the whole annual profit of Suomen
Pankki to the State unless the Parliamentary
Supervisory Council decides otherwise, as well
as transferring around 740 million of thecapital to the State, which would have forced
Suomen Pankki to sell foreign reserve assets.
The ECB objected to the proposal primarily
because of the combined effect of the suggested
amendments on the financial situation of
Suomen Pankki and the lack of any statutorysafeguards ensuring the performance of ESCBtasks, which together would undermine the
financial independence of Suomen Pankki. In
December 2003 the ECB was consulted on a
revised government proposal to amend the
Suomen Pankki Act. In its second opinion, the
ECB welcomed the fact that the final legislativeproposal submitted to the ECB did not reducethe capital of Suomen Pankki. However, the
ECB noted that the requirements for financial
independence were not fully satisfied and that
the proposal was therefore still incompatible
with the Treaty and its intentions. Following thesecond opinion, the legislative proposal waswithdrawn.In addition to the opinions adopted inaccordance with Article 105 (4) of the Treaty,
the ECB also delivered an opinion pursuant toArticle 48 of the Treaty on European Unionconcerning the draft Treaty establishing a
Constitution for Europe, which is presented in
more detail in Section 1.1 of Chapter 4.The ECB also delivered two opinions pursuantto Article 112 (2) (b) of the Treaty andArticle 11.2 of the Statute of the ESCB. These
opinions concerned recommendations from the
EU Council on the appointment of the new
President of the ECB and a new member of the
Executive Board of the ECB.A list of the opinions adopted in 2003 and early
2004 is included as an annex.6.3THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE BORROWING
AND LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE

EUROPEAN COMMUNITYIn accordance with Article 123 (2) of the Treaty
and Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC)
No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002, the ECBcontinues to have responsibility for theadministration of the borrowing and lending
operations of the European Community under
the Medium-Term Financial Assistance
mechanism. During 2003, however, the ECB
performed no administration tasks of thisnature, as there was no outstanding balance atthe end of 2002 and as no new operations were
initiated during 2003.6.4RESERVE MANAGEMENT SERVICES
In 2003 the Eurosystem started work on a new
framework for the banking services that its
members offer to non-EU central banks,
monetary authorities, third countries and
international institutions for reserve
management purposes. At the core of thisframework is a benchmark range of servicesthat will allow customers to manage their euro-
denominated reserve assets through any of the
euro area central banks that have opted to
provide this range of services. The new
framework will offer customers the possibilityof using the services concerned underharmonised conditions, irrespective of the
Eurosystem central bank they have selected as
service provider. Details of the new framework
will be finalised in the first half of 2004 and
then implemented in the second half of the year.27CON/2003/22, published on the ECB™s website.

FINANCIAL STABILITY
AND INTEGRATION
108ECBAnnualReport
2003Throughout 2003 financial stability was animportant item on the agenda of international
and European institutions and fora. At the
international level, the Financial StabilityForum continued to provide an important

contribution to identifying sources of

vulnerability for the financial system from a

global perspective. At the EU level, following a
decision taken by the ECOFIN Council inDecember 2002, the Economic and Financial
Committee (EFC) started to hold regular
discussions on financial stability issues
relevant for the EU. Within the Eurosystem, the
Governing Council also began holding regular
discussions on financial stability conditions inthe euro area/EU supported by work carried outby the ECB in collaboration with the ESCB™s
Banking Supervision Committee (BSC). The
results of this work are also intended to
contribute to international and European
discussions on the matter.1.1FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING
The monitoring of financial stability
developments and conditions conducted by the
ECB in collaboration with the BSC is intended
to identify potential sources of vulnerability inthe financial system of the euro area/EU and to

assess its resilience to potential shocks. While
the financial system as a whole (banks, non-

bank financial institutions, financial markets
and the financial infrastructure) is monitored,the focus is on banks, given that they continue
to represent the main component of the euro
area/EU financial system. In order to conduct a
proper assessment, both cyclical and structural

developments must be taken into account.CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTSThe unwinding of financial imbalances which
had accumulated in the EU in the 1990s
continued to have an impact on the financial
system in 2003. However, the system continued
to prove its resilience to these imbalances,
also reflecting the improved macroeconomicand financial backdrop as 2003 progressed
(discussed in greater detail in Chapter 1).1 FINANCIAL STABILITY
Most of the risks to the stability of the
European financial system were the legacy of
remaining domestic financial imbalances,
notably in the corporate sector (see also Box 2).
Corporations in Europe made efforts to adjust
their balance sheets, particularly in thosesectors where relatively high indebtedness
had been an earlier concern. They embarked
upon cost-cutting programmes, scaled back
investment and, in some sectors such as
telecommunications, restructured their debt.While these efforts generally paid off inraising profitability, they were not sufficient

to bring down debt ratios for the corporate
sector as a whole. There were, however,
sectoral differences, with financing conditions
improving notably in the telecommunicationssector.As for European households, debt/income
ratios rose further in the course of 2003, mostly
reflecting an accumulation of mortgage debt in
an environment of historically low interest rates
and relatively stable labour market conditions.
The relatively high demand of households formortgages proved to be important in sustaining
the interest income of banks in an otherwise
challenging environment. However, in some
countries it also led to relatively rapid increases
in residential property prices, which could posesome risk for credit institutions in thosecountries in the event of a sudden downward

movement in house prices. Overall, however,
these risks appeared to be rather remote.The stability of financial markets improved in2003. After three years of almost continuousdecline and exceptional volatility, equity
markets started to recover in mid-March 2003
and volatility settled down as geopolitical risks
receded and confidence in prospects for an
economic recovery began to broaden. Thisprovided scope for corporations to issue freshequity and/or debt, with bond spreads

diminishing significantly and bond activity
improving. To some extent, these developments
could also be explained by a ﬁsearch for yieldﬂ
by investors in an environment where long-terminterest rates had reached low levels by109ECBAnnualReport
2003historical standards. Low interest rates in early2003, however, strained in particular some
financial institutions, notably insurance
companies and pension funds, through their
impact on these institutions™ liabilities. Thesestrains were eased by an upturn in long-terminterest rates in the second half of the year.In early 2003, following three years ofprofit erosion, EU insurance companies were

confronted with significant pressures on theirsolvency positions that were the result of boththe tumble in stock prices since 2000 and
the more recent downward pressure on long-
term interest rates. However, the subsequent
rebound tended to ease balance sheet strains and
some signs of improvement became evidentby mid-2003. Nonetheless, some solvencyand income pressures remained, as well as

uncertainties surrounding the extent to which
insurance companies had accumulated credit
risk through the credit risk transfer market.The EU banking sector remained resilient, albeitchallenged for a third consecutive year by sub-par economic growth in 2003. It absorbed the
adverse effects of a less benign than expected
environment. Banks responded well to the
challenging environment by cutting costs,
reorganising businesses and improving theirrisk management policies. Large bankssucceeded in maintaining, and even improving,
profitability and solvency levels in the first half

of 2003. Relatively low provisioning for loan
losses, cost savings and an upturn in income

from financial market-related activities all
served to boost profitability in 2003. Thesedevelopments were also reflected in the
regulatory solvency ratios of EU banks, which
remained favourable. However, the ratios of
some banks benefited from asset sales and from
a reduction in risk-weighted assets rather thanfrom either new equity issuance or profitreserving.In February 2003 the ECB published for thefirst time a report entitled ﬁEU banking sector
stabilityﬂ, which was followed by a secondreport in November of the same year. Thereports summarised the main findings by the
BSC of the regular monitoring of the stability of
the EU banking sector.STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTSThe difficult economic and financial market
environment in recent years compelled banks
to enhance efficiency, inter alia through

cost-cutting and the shedding of non-core

activities. This implied a slowing-down in,or discontinuation of, some of the longer-term trends apparent in earlier years,

notably internationalisation, consolidation and

disintermediation. Overall, these responses to
difficult business conditions helped banks to
withstand ongoing strains and also contributed
to improving banking stability over the mediumand longer term.Internationalisation strategies, particularly ininvestment banking and trading activities, werefrequently scaled back, although links to some
regions, such as central and eastern Europe,continued to strengthen. A focus by banks ontheir ﬁhome marketsﬂ was apparent, particularly
for retail operations. However, regional cross-
border banking activities, regarded as a natural
extension of business in the home market, were
further expanded. It seems that competitivepressures in the home market have, to a large
extent, driven recent internationalisation
activities. Thus recent expansion was mainly
aimed at improving profitability by entering
markets with higher margins and where there
was a clear comparative advantage.Consolidation in the banking sector continued,albeit at a reduced speed, but competitive
pressures in general remained high despite this
increasing concentration. Banks continued to
opt for a distribution strategy based on the
simultaneous use of branches and remotechannels, which could also be seen as part of
banks™ efforts to improve the quality of service
to customers. However, branch networks

remained at the core of banks™ distribution

strategies. They increasingly moved away110ECBAnnualReport
2003from the pure processing of transactionstowards the provision of advice-intensive, more
sophisticated and value-added services.With regard to intermediation, i.e. the role ofbanks as intermediaries in channelling fundsfrom depositors to borrowers, banks were faced
with reduced corporate demand for funds and
capital market issuance. However, retail
activities proved to be a stable source of
income. In particular, banks™ retail customerstended to shed equity from their portfolios amid
a volatile market environment, favouring
relatively safe and liquid deposits. At the same
time, household lending remained rather
buoyant.EU banks expanded their range of products andservices, particularly to retail customers. Banks
offered a greater number of new saving
instruments comprising products that link
returns to an index in combination with option
features, for example by including a floor on
losses. In some countries, high-risk investmentalternatives such as hedge funds have beenmade available to retail investors through
banks. Hence, consumers are being faced with
ever-increasing product complexity. This has
induced banks to increase their efforts to
enhance investor confidence in securities-related products via organisational changes andimprovements in their governance structures.Finally, banks improved their risk managementwith a view to better controlling increased
credit risk and also in response to thechallenge posed by forthcoming changes incapital requirements (New Basel Capital
Accord, or Basel II; see Section 2 of this
chapter). Increasing participation in the credit

risk transfer market was one avenue pursued
to better manage risks. Credit risk transferinstruments enable banks to unbundle risksmore easily and to shape their credit risk

exposure more effectively. Banks mainly tended

to use these instruments to reduce credit risk,
although in some cases they were able to
achieve better portfolio diversification byassuming additional credit risks. Banks alsostepped up their efforts to increase resilience tooperational risks.A more detailed analysis of the main structuraldevelopments in the EU banking sector can befound in the BSC™s report entitled ﬁStructuralanalysis of the EU banking sectorﬂ published by

the ECB in November 2003.
1.2COOPERATION IN CRISIS SITUATIONS
In early 2003 EU central banks and supervisory

authorities agreed on a Memorandum of

Understanding (MoU) concerning cooperation
in crisis situations. This MoU consists of a set
of principles and procedures for cooperation incrisis situations involving individual creditinstitutions or banking groups, or relating to
disturbances in financial markets and/or market
infrastructures which could have potential
common implications for Member States. These
principles and procedures deal specifically with
the identification of the national authoritiesresponsible for crisis management, the requiredflows of information between all authorities
involved and the practical conditions for
sharing cross-border information. In the course

of 2003, a crisis management simulation
was carried out with the aim of enhancingunderstanding of how the provisions of theMoU would assist the organisation of
cooperation and information-sharing between
authorities in practice. This exercise provided
very useful insights into the different aspects of
cross-border cooperation between bankingsupervisors and NCBs in the event of a
financial crisis.111ECBAnnualReport
20032.1THE LAMFALUSSY FRAMEWORK
Following the results of the public consultationon the report by the EFC on ﬁEU Arrangements

for Financial Regulation, Supervision andStabilityﬂ, the ECOFIN Council recommended
in December 2002 that the new Lamfalussy
framework1, which was already in place in thesecurities sector, be extended to all other
financial sectors. The adoption of the new
framework is expected to enhance the flexibilityand efficiency of the regulatory process, as itdistinguishes between primary legislation,
adopted by the ECOFIN Council and the
European Parliament through the co-decision
procedure (known as level 1 legislation), and
secondary legislation, which consists ofimplementing measures that can be adoptedmore quickly and in a more flexible way. This
will enable the regulatory process to respond
more quickly and effectively to technological
change and market developments. This new
framework is also designed to meet the need
for effective supervisory cooperation andconvergence, and is thus expected to contributeto a more consistent implementation of EU rules

across Member States.The Lamfalussy framework relies in particularon the involvement of regulatory committeesin the different financial sectors. Thesecommittees, which are also known as level 2
committees, are composed of representatives of
the Member States nominated by the relevant

ministers. In addition, supervisory committees,
also known as level 3 committees, have beenmandated to promote the convergence of
supervisory practices, to enhance supervisory
cooperation (including the exchange of
information on supervised institutions) and to
provide technical advice to the Commission on
draft implementing measures.In November 2003 the Commission adopted aseries of measures to implement the Council™s
recommendation. In the banking sector, the
existing Banking Advisory Committee (BAC)

has been transformed into the regulatoryEuropean Banking Committee (EBC) and a newCommittee of European Banking Supervisors
(CEBS) has been set up. Close cooperation
between the ESCB™s Banking Supervision
Committee (BSC) and the CEBS will be
sought to ensure that there is no overlap inactivities. In the insurance sector, the existingInsurance Committee has been converted
into the regulatory European Insurance and

Occupational Pensions Committee (EIOPC). A
new Committee of European Insurance and
Occupational Pension Supervisors (CEIOPS)
has also been established. In the areaof financial conglomerates, the regulatory
Financial Conglomerates Committee (FCC) was
established in 2003 with no plans to set up a
supervisory committee. The ECB participates as

an observer or non-voting member in theregulatory and supervisory committees, withthe exception of those in the insurance sector.
Thus the ECB is able to contribute to the
shaping of EU financial regulation and
supervision in accordance with its institutional
tasks.2.2BANKING
In the area of banking regulation, the review
of the framework for minimum capital
requirements and the preparation of the NewBasel Capital Accord continued throughout2003. The ECB, which participates as an
observer in the relevant committees, continued

to contribute to the shaping of the new
framework.At the international level, the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision (BCBS) made
substantial progress in several areas. First, it
finalised and published in May 2003 the results
of the third quantitative impact study (known as
the ﬁQIS3ﬂ) aimed at gauging the overall impactof the new rules on banks™ minimum capitalrequirements. The study involved banks across
43 countries and thus went well beyond those
countries represented in the BCBS. Its main1ﬁFinal Report of the Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of

2FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
112ECBAnnualReport
2003findings were encouraging as they wereconsistent with the BCBS™s objectives to
increase the risk sensitivity of capital
requirements while keeping the overall amount
of current capital requirements broadlyunchanged. Second, the BCBS conducted twopublic consultations. The ﬁthird consultative
paperﬂ was released in April 2003 and
comments were published in August. The
public consultation confirmed the broad support
for the structure of the new Accord and the needto adopt a more risk-sensitive framework.Another public consultation was launched in
October on proposed amendments that would

change the treatment of expected versus
unexpected losses under the new Accord™s

internal ratings-based approach. In addition, theBCBS identified scope for further improvementin the areas of asset securitisation, credit card
commitments and certain credit risk mitigation
techniques, on which work continues. The third
area in which the BCBS made substantial
progress was the analysis of issues concerning
the implementation of the new Accord, whichwill also be reflected in national legislation.
These issues were increasingly taken into
consideration by the BCBS through the work of
the Accord Implementation Group. The BCBS
also released a paper specifying high-level
principles for the cross-border implementationof the new capital requirements.In its response to the third consultative paperpublished on its website in September 2003, the
ECB reiterated its overall support for the Basel
reform and acknowledged the progressachieved. In addition to its input on severaltechnical issues, the ECB focused on issues
warranting particular attention for both
finalisation of the new Accord and
implementation of the new rules, as well as on
future priorities. The ECB welcomed theproposals to tackle the potential pro-cyclical
effects and pointed out that some improvements
could still be made by strengthening the

incentives for banks to opt for more advanced
risk management policies. Special emphasis
was given to the importance of the timelycompletion and implementation of thenew Accord. From a more forward-looking
perspective, the ECB underlined the need for
close monitoring of the new regime in order to
develop a full understanding of all its possibleimplications. The ECB also stressed the need toprioritise work on accounting and provisioning,

as well as on the definition of own funds and on
the convergence of supervisory practices.At the EU level, the reform of the regulatorycapital framework conducted within the remit ofthe Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP, see

Section 3 of this chapter) continued to follow
the Basel reform process closely, while at the
same time taking European particularities
into account. In July 2003 the EuropeanCommission released a third working documentfor public consultation together with an
analysis of the EU results of the third
quantitative impact study. Significant features
of the EU context include the scope of
application of the new rules, the nature of the

EU framework, the treatment of small andmedium-sized enterprises and the suitability ofthe framework for small and less complex
banks. Like the BCBS conclusions, the findings
of the European Commission on the quantitative
impact study, released in parallel with the third
consultative proposals, were supportive of the
reform™s main objectives. In addition, in April2003 the European Commission released two
documents for consultation, one on real estate
lending and one on the treatment of covered
bonds, and it subsequently published the
comments received on these two topics.
The ECB provided comments on the EuropeanCommission™s proposals for the revision of the
capital framework of banks and investment
firms. The ECB supported the work being
undertaken at the EU level and highlighted theimportance of maintaining consistency betweenthe New Basel Capital Accord and the revised
EU framework and ensuring that they were
completed and implemented at the same time.
113ECBAnnualReport
20032.3SECURITIES
In 2003 good progress was made on severalinitiatives to fill the gaps in the European
securities markets legislation and to updateexisting rules. The ECB contributed to
the shaping of the relevant rules in the context
of both the preparatory discussions in
the appropriate EU committees and formal
consultations.Within the context of the FSAP, two directiveswere adopted and a further two came closer to
completion. In January 2003 the Market Abuse
Directive was adopted, providing for
harmonised rules on the prevention of insider

dealing and market manipulation, and in July2003 the Prospectus Directive was introduced,providing for a single passport for European
securities issuers. In March 2003 the European

Commission set out in its draft transparency
directive disclosure requirements for European
issuers listed on regulated markets. A common
position was adopted in December by theECOFIN Council with regard to the proposalfor a new directive on markets in financial
instruments, which would replace the existing

Investment Service Directive dating back to
1993.In its opinion on this proposed new directive,the ECB welcomed the principles underlying
the revised regulatory framework. An effective

implementation of the proposed directive
clearly has the potential to foster the integration

of European securities markets. Morespecifically, as regards the new regulatory
framework on trade execution, the ECB
welcomed the proposed strengthening of
transparency rules as a tool to avoid market

fragmentation and to allow investors to choose
the most efficient trading venues. However, theECB emphasised that the new transparency
rules should be applied to debt securities as
well as to shares, and that the means for a full

comparison of all market prices should be
provided for.2.4OTHER ISSUES
The EU accounting framework has been at the
centre of debate owing to the legal requirement
that all listed European companies, includingbanks, prepare their consolidated financialstatements in accordance with International
Accounting Standards (IAS) by 2005. The
ECB has a keen interest in this debate as
the accounting reforms will have a profound
impact on the banking and financial industry.Furthermore, harmonised and high qualitystandards will provide a significant
contribution to the integration and efficiency of
financial markets in the euro area.The ECB™s interest also stems from concernsthat the wider use of fair value for financialinstruments, mentioned in the IAS proposals,
might have significant effects on financial
stability. The Governing Council, particularly

in the light of analyses conducted in this area
since 2001, has reiterated in letters to the IAS
Board and the European Commission itsconcerns about the potential implicationsfor financial stability of the introduction
of fair value accounting for all financial
instruments, particularly in relation to the

completion of IAS 39, which deals with the
recognition and measurement of financialinstruments.Finally, given the increasing number ofreforms being made to national supervisory

structures, the ECB published a report entitled
ﬁDevelopments in national supervisorystructuresﬂ in June 2003 in order to provide aﬁsnapshotﬂ of the main changes which had
recently occurred in this area, together with the
resulting institutional settings within the EU
and the acceding countries.114ECBAnnualReport
2003The ESCB is committed to the integration ofEuropean financial markets and market
infrastructures because of their key role in the
transmission of monetary policy and in
financial stability, and because their integrationshould help to create a level playing-field for all
agents regardless of their location within the
EU. In addition, Article 105 of the Treaty states
that without prejudice to the objective of price
stability, the ESCB shall support the general
economic policies in the Community, amongwhich financial integration occupies aprominent position. This support takes the form
of direct action, catalysis of collective action
and contributions towards raising the level of
awareness of the need for integration and the
means for achieving it.In 2003 the ECB intensified its activities tohelp to achieve a broad-based integration of
Europe™s financial system, both by means of its
own activities and by contributing to the work
of other European bodies within various
committees and fora.THE ECB™S CONTRIBUTION TO THE EU STRATEGY

FOR FINANCIAL SERVICESThe current framework for achieving a more
integrated and efficient financial system in the

EU is based on the 1999 Financial ServicesAction Plan (FSAP) and on a regulatoryprocess inspired by the 2001 Lamfalussy
Report. The first high-level assessment of this
framework is expected to take place in the
summer of 2004.
As agreed by the Heads of State or Governmentat the Brussels European Council in March
2003, most legislative measures initially
considered in the FSAP will have been adopted
by April 2004. The European Parliament will
then go into recess and further legislativework will be suspended. Work is still underway on several important initiatives. The
Lamfalussy process is now being extended
to other financial sectors (see Section 2.1 of this
chapter). Full and successful implementation of
the Lamfalussy process should provide theEuropean financial system with a faster and
3FINANCIAL INTEGRATION
more efficient regulatory structure than iscurrently the case.While fundamental progress has been made in
recent years, there is still a considerable amountof work to be done to further integrate Europe™sfinancial system. New EU initiatives have
recently been launched to define the ﬁpost-
FSAPﬂ strategy, which will require the close
cooperation of all those involved.The ECB has been closely involved in this workand has provided its views in the form of ECB

opinions, for example on the proposal for

the new directive on markets in financial
instruments (see also Section 2.3 of this
chapter), and in the different fora where thevarious issues are discussed. In particular, theECB considers that the measures of the FSAP
provide the core legislative framework for the
single market in financial services. The
potential for further financial integration within
this framework offers opportunities and poses
challenges to public authorities as well as
market participants.The ECB is of the opinion that it is importantfor public authorities to implement the FSAP
measures in a coherent manner across Member
States. The extension of the Lamfalussy processwill allow for more uniform technical rulesin this respect. This should contribute to
the establishment of a common regulatory
framework for market players which may also
be quickly adjusted if needed. Furthermore, as
integration proceeds, the transmission channelsfor systemic risk are likely to change, whichjustifies increased cooperation and information
exchange between supervisors and central
banks in order to promote a robust supervisory

and financial stability framework.To complement public sector initiatives, market
participants also need to enhance their
contribution to EU financial integration through
collective action in two main areas. First, they

need to participate effectively in the policy-
making process in the context of enhanced
consultation procedures at the EU level.115ECBAnnualReport
2003Second, collective action by marketparticipants, possibly with the support of
public authorities, is equally warranted in the
area of market conventions and product

standardisation.THE ECB™S ROLE IN FOSTERING COORDINATION

AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS
Beyond its cooperation with other public
authorities, the ECB also acts in collaboration
with the private sector in order to fostercollective action. The Short-Term EuropeanPaper (STEP) initiative and the activities of the
European Financial Markets Lawyers Group

(EFMLG) are two examples of the ECB™s
involvement in private sector initiatives.The ECB welcomes and encourages the STEPinitiative, which is currently being carried out
by a group of market participants under the
auspices of the ACI, the Financial Markets
Association. This initiative aims to integrate the
fragmented European markets for short-term
debt instruments and to promote theirdevelopment.The ECB was requested to play the role offacilitator in this initiative, a role similar to that
played when it established the EONIA. In
particular, the ECB has already hosted, at the
request and on behalf of private sectorparticipants, a public consultation on means of
further integrating this particular market
segment.STEP undertakes to create a de facto integratedwholesale market for short-term debtinstruments through the convergence of
existing European markets. The aim is to help
market practices to converge under the existing
European and national legislative frameworks
by means of market convention. This initiativewould rely on the voluntary participation ofissuers prepared to meet certain conditions
specified in the market convention in order to

have their issuance programmes granted a STEP
label. The above-mentioned conditions would
not substitute or change existing nationalregulations, but would be supplementary tothose already in existence. Credit institutions,other financial intermediaries (including issuers
of asset-backed securities), corporations and
public authorities would all be entitled to apply
for the STEP label for their issuanceprogrammes.The EFMLG was established in 1999 and aimsto discuss and promote initiatives leading to
greater harmonisation of European financial
market activities (laws and market practices)following the introduction of the euro. TheEFMLG is composed of senior lawyers from
credit institutions based in the EU and selected
on the basis of their personal expertise.
Recently, the EFMLG provided support and
assistance to the ACI with regard to the legalaspects of the STEP initiative. The group hasalso focused on the removal of legal barriers to

the cross-border use of collateral, the legal
aspects of netting arrangements in the EU, the
harmonisation of the legal framework for rights
in securities evidenced by book entries and the
dematerialisation of securities, i.e. the processof issuing a security under an electronic schemerather than issuing physical certificates.2SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA
In 2002 the Eurosystem agreed on a cooperation
model with the European Payments Council(EPC), i.e. the governance structure of theEuropean banking sector set up with the aim of

creating a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)
in which differences between the levels of
service for national and cross-border retail
payments are to be eliminated by 2010.The ECB participated as an observer in the EPCplenary, which is the decision-making body of
the EPC, and the EPC working groups for

cash, cards, straight-through processing (STP)
and infrastructure. The Eurosystem formallyassessed the banking sector™s achievements in
terms of the SEPA in a progress report entitled
ﬁTowards a Single Euro Payments Areaﬂ
published in June 2003. In this report, the
Eurosystem expressed strong support for the2For further details on the EFMLG see www.efmlg.org.
116ECBAnnualReport
2003decisions taken and the general commitmentsmade by the EPC. One milestone was the launch
of STEP 2 in April 2003 by the Euro Banking
Association, a cooperative undertaking between
EU-based commercial banks and EU branchesof non-EU banks. STEP 2 is a new retail cross-
border system for the processing of bulk
payments (currently only credit transfers). It is
the first service provider for a pan-European
automated clearing house (PE-ACH). STEP 2™s
receiver capability Œ which is a bank™scapability to receive a payment through thePE-ACH Œ was gradually extended to all EU
banks, thereby increasing its market share of
intra-EU credit transfers.However, the progress report also made it clearthat should banks backtrack on their promiseddeliverables to achieve a SEPA, the Eurosystem
would consider regulatory measures in addition

to its catalyst role. The Eurosystem specifically
stressed the importance of implementing pan-
European standards for STP as a prerequisite
for accomplishing a SEPA for all payment
instruments.In the progress report, the Eurosystem listedspecific indicators (known as ﬁSEPA
indicatorsﬂ) for measuring progress made
towards a SEPA against the EPC™s ownobjectives and milestones. In the second half of2003, the EPC and the Eurosystem agreed on a

reporting framework for these SEPA indicators,
including quarterly reports by the EPC to
the Eurosystem. The first report, delivered
at the end of 2003, showed progress indifferent areas, such as the implementation ofInternational Bank Account Numbers (IBAN)

and the introduction of a basic credit transfer
service (Credeuro) with a guaranteed speed of
execution of three days.In October 2003 the ECB, in cooperation withthe EPC, arranged a workshop on the SEPA
targeted specifically at involving acceding
countries in the SEPA process. Moreover,

meetings were held in the course of the year
with EU market participants in the ContactGroup for Euro Payments Strategy (COGEPS)on the subject of large-value payments issues,as well as retail issues. Throughout 2003 the
Eurosystem also continued to cooperate closely

with the European Commission in view of

the complementary roles played by the twoinstitutions in terms of facilitating the SEPA.In this respect, the ECB responded to the
public consultation launched by the European
Commission on a ﬁNew Legal Framework for

Payments in the Internal Marketﬂ.CONSOLIDATION OF THE EUROPEAN SECURITIES

INFRASTRUCTUREThe Eurosystem has a keen interest in the
integration of the securities infrastructure at the
EU level in order to ensure a level playing-field
across national boundaries. The process ofconsolidation of the EU securities clearing andsettlement industry continued in 2003 with the

merger between two major central counterparty
clearing houses, Clearnet and the London
Clearing House. The merger in 2002 of the
securities settlement systems Euroclear and

CrestCo, which settle transactions for thestock exchanges served by Clearnet and theLondon Clearing House, marked another
important step towards a more integrated
securities infrastructure in the EU.STATISTICAL DATA ON THE DEGREE OF FINANCIAL
INTEGRATION IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF THE
EURO AREAIn 2003 further statistical data were provided to
assess the level of financial integration in the
euro area™s financial system. Box 9 describes
some of the measures used to assess the level ofintegration achieved in financial markets in the
euro area. Furthermore, the Eurosystem Œ
together with academics Œ has promoted policy-
relevant research on the level of integration

in the financial system of the euro area (see

Box 10).117ECBAnnualReport
2003Box 9MEASURES OF FINANCIAL MARKET INTEGRATION IN THE EURO AREA
Several quantitative measures can be used to measure the level of integration in euro area
financial markets. This box briefly describes some of these measures and assesses the level of
integration observed in different financial markets of the euro area.1Measures of financial integration make it possible to assess the extent to which geographical
considerations affect the price of financial instruments and the behaviour of market participants.Some of these measures are based on the law of one price. They test whether assets which are
comparable and available in all euro area countries trade at the same price throughout the euro

area. Other measures estimate the relative importance of factors common to the euro area in the
pricing of assets as opposed to idiosyncratic factors (notably country-related factors). Finally,
some measures are used to quantify the effects of frictions on cross-border investment.In general, most measures show that the degree of integration in the various financial markets isstill heterogeneous. While integration is quite advanced in many segments of the money market,
it is less advanced in the bond and equity markets.Yields on government bonds with similar, or in some cases identical, credit risk, maturity andissuing characteristics have not yet entirely converged. Differences in primary and secondarymarket liquidity or in the degree of development of derivatives markets connected to the various
individual bond markets may partly account for this.
In the equity markets, the level of integration is not particularly high, although equity returns
appear to be increasingly determined by factors common to the euro area. At the same time, the
home bias in equity holdings (i.e. the fact that investors seem to allocate a disproportionatelylarge fraction of their equity holdings to domestic stocks) has decreased considerably over the

past few years. However, there are still a number of significant barriers to further integration in
the equity markets. Examples include cross-country regulatory differences and the considerable
fragmentation of the euro area™s clearing and settlement systems.In credit markets, there remains significant market fragmentation. For example, there arepersistent home biases in lending to and borrowing from non-financial corporations and
households. Some of these home biases are ﬁnaturalﬂ, that is, explained by proximity advantage
and information asymmetries; others are mainly due to regulatory obstacles, such as tax
regulations, bankruptcy law, etc.1For further details of these measures, see the article entitled ﬁThe integration of Europe™s financial marketsﬂ in the October
 2003 issue
of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
118ECBAnnualReport
2003Box 10RESEARCH NETWORK ON CAPITAL MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN EUROPE
In April 2002 the ECB and the Center for Financial Studies (CFS) launched a Research Networkto promote research on capital markets and financial integration in Europe. This Network aims
to stimulate and coordinate policy-relevant research by academic scholars and researchers from
policy institutions, contributing significantly to the ECB™s understanding of the current and
future structure and integration of the financial system in Europe and its links to the financialsystems of the United States and Japan. Further information can be found on the Network™swebsite (www.eu-financial-system.org). The Network™s first workshop was held at the ECB in
April 2002 and concentrated on agenda-setting, identifying five topics of priority for research:
(i) bank competition and the geographical scope of banking activities, (ii) international portfolio
choices and asset market links between Europe, the United States and Japan, (iii) European
bond markets, (iv) European securities settlement systems (SSSs) and (v) the emergence anddevelopment of start-up financing and new markets in Europe. In March 2003 the secondworkshop, hosted by Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands Bank in Helsinki, addressed the first two of
these topics. In November 2003 the third workshop, hosted by the Bank of Greece in Athens,
focused on the third topic, as well as discussing the fourth and fifth topics.1 Within the contextof this Network, the ECB also established the ﬁLamfalussy Fellowshipﬂ programme, named
after the first President of the EMI. This programme sponsors young researchers to conductvaluable research on the above-mentioned topics. Two years of work on the Network will beconcluded with a symposium at the ECB in Frankfurt in May 2004, presenting the most
important results found. Some of these results reveal first of all that some of the inherent
characteristics of traditional loan and deposit business constrain the cross-border expansion of
commercial banking, even in a common currency area. Second, some theoretical research
suggests that supervisory structures may not be neutral towards further European bankingintegration. Third, there is increasing evidence that the introduction of the euro has contributedto a reduction in the cost of capital in the euro area. Fourth, too strong a vertical integration
between trading and securities settlement platforms can be an obstacle to the efficient
consolidation of SSSs. Finally, the growing globalisation of firms™ activities is one factor
behind the increasing correlation of equity returns observed around the world.1In October 2002 the ECB also held its Second Central Banking Conference. The proceedings are available on the ECB™s website, s

The transformation of the European financial system,
 June 2003.With regard to the euro area banking system, the
ECB is developing a set of key indicators to
measure the degree of integration in the system.
These indicators are constructed on the basis of
quarterly stock data provided by MFIs. Theyprovide direct measures of cross-borderbanking business within the euro area. In
addition to traditional measures of the share of
cross-border activity, these indicators also
focus on the distribution of activity, the role
played by national banking systems as the huband the disparities between national bankingsystems in terms of access. Indicators show thatthe share of cross-border activity is modest for
the retail segments of the banking business (see
Box 9), while it is more important and growing
in the interbank market for deposits. It is worthnoting, however, that when conducting thesecross-border activities, banks are becoming
increasingly neutral as regards the geographical
location of counterparties within the euro area
for retail and wholesale segments alike.119ECBAnnualReport
2003New harmonised MFI interest rate statisticspublished for the first time in December 2003
allow for a comparison of retail bank interest
rates on deposits and loans across the euro area
on a harmonised basis (see Section 4 of Chapter2). These new monthly statistics contribute tothe assessment of the convergence towards a
single European financial market for deposits
and loans and will increase the transparency of
banking business in the euro area. Financial
market statistics produced by the ECB alsoinclude price and volume indicators for themoney, bond and equity markets as well as
volatility and convergence measures across all
euro area market segments.120ECBAnnualReport
2003One of the statutory roles of the Eurosystem is to
exercise oversight over payment and clearing
systems. This function aims to ensure that the
general organisation of the payment flows within
the economy is efficient and safe. In particular,systemic risks arising either from the
malfunctioning of payment and clearing systems
or from the contagion effects of a failure of a

participant in the system should be minimised.Furthermore, the Eurosystem takes a general
interest in other infrastructures which areused for the transfer of securities, such as
securities clearing and settlement systems,
because failures during the settlement of
collateral could jeopardise the implementation
of monetary policy and the smooth functioningof payment systems. Disruptions in securitiessettlement systems (SSSs) can spread to

payment systems owing to the existence of

delivery versus payment (DVP) mechanisms
for the transfer of securities and cash payments.
Similarly, central counterparties™ inability to

clear transactions can hinder the settlement ofsecurities transactions. In view of this generalinterest, the ECB met with the European Central

Securities Depositories Association in 2003
to discuss recent developments affecting
settlement service providers. Furthermore, the
Eurosystem discussed its collateral framework,
which was subject to a public consultation in2003, as well as developments concerning

short-term securities, relayed links
3 and
securities transactions with market participants
at the Contact Group on Euro Securities
Infrastructures. Detailed information on themarket infrastructure is given in the ECB™spublication entitled ﬁPayment and securities
settlement systems in the European Unionﬂ,
also known as the ﬁBlue Bookﬂ.4The Eurosystem™s oversight function extendsfrom systems for the exchange of very largepayments (ﬁlarge-value payment systemsﬂ) and
the network providers on which those systems
rely to retail payment services as well as to
other activities that could affect the smooth
functioning of payments in the euro area.
4OVERSIGHT OF MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE
4.1OVERSIGHT OF LARGE-VALUE EURO
PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE
THE TARGET SYSTEM
The oversight role of the Eurosystem comprises
all euro payment systems including thosemanaged by the Eurosystem itself, e.g. the Trans-
European Automated Real-time Gross settlement
Express Transfer (TARGET) system. With regard
to the latter, the minimum oversight standards

applied are as strict as those applied to privately
operated payment systems.According to the framework decided by theGoverning Council at the beginning of 2003,
there are two major operational objectives for
the oversight of TARGET. First, overseersof TARGET (i.e. the NCBs for the domesticcomponents, the ECB for the EPM) are to review
the various aspects of the TARGET system and
assess its compliance with the ﬁCore Principles
for Systemically Important Payment Systemsﬂ5adopted by the Governing Council in 2001 as the
basis for its oversight policy on systemicallyimportant payment systems. Second, overseersare to inform those responsible at the NCBs and

the Governing Council of the results of this
assessment so that, if necessary, measures are
considered and implemented to ensure full
compliance with the Core Principles.In 2003 TARGET overseers assessed all
components of TARGET against the Core
Principles.6 The overall outcome of this
3With a relayed link SSSs no longer have to establish a link with all
other SSSs, but can limit themselves to one link with an intermediate
SSS that is connected to many other SSSs.4In September 2003 the ECB published an addendum to the Blue Book
with data on all 15 EU Member States from 1997 to 2001. Thispublication was prepared in cooperation with the NCBs.
In addition, a two-day seminar for central bankers entitled ﬁPayment
and securities settlement systemsﬂ was held at the ECB in the samemonth.5Report by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems entitled
ﬁCore Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systemsﬂ, BIS,
January 2001. This report also includes an outline of theresponsibilities of the central banks in this respect. Responsibility B
states that central banks should ensure that any systemically importantpayment system they operate complies with the Core Principles.
6As part of the same assessment, overseers also evaluated the other
euro large-value payment systems, namely the French Paris NetSettlement (PNS), the Finnish Pankkien On-line Pikasiirrot jaSekit-järjestelmä (POPS) system, and the Spanish Servicio de Pagos
Interbancarios (SPI) against the Core Principles.
121ECBAnnualReport
2003assessment was positive, although issues forfurther improvement were identified. The
results of this assessment will be made public.
EURO 1The Euro Banking Association (EBA) is a
cooperative undertaking between EU-based
commercial banks and EU branches of non-EU

banks. The EBA created a multilateral large-
value EU-wide payment system for euro credit
transfers, called EURO 1. In April 2003 theEBA established a new retail cross-bordersystem, known as ﬁSTEP 2ﬂ (see also Section 3
of this chapter). STEP 2 settles in EURO 1,
making it necessary to implement some
technical changes to the latter. In November
2003 the EBA also introduced a new functioncalled the ﬁFlexible Settlement Mechanismﬂallowing banks to settle their STEP 2 positions
in EURO 1 without becoming direct members/
shareholders of EURO 1.As overseer of EURO 1, the ECB evaluated thechanges to the system in respect of its
compliance with the Core Principles. The ECBfound only minor issues for concern, which did
not have any significant impact on the safety
and efficiency of EURO 1. The ECB will

address these findings in cooperation with the
EBA in due course.CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEMThe Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) is a
system designed to settle foreign exchange
transactions on a simultaneous, final and
irrevocable basis. Prior to the introduction ofthe CLS, each side of a trade was paidseparately. The systemic risk in the event of
default was high considering the time interval
which typically elapsed between the settlement
of the two sides of the trade. The CLS was
established as a market response to the pressureexercised by central banks to reduce foreignexchange settlement risk (known as ﬁHerstatt
riskﬂ).7 The ECB performs a dual role with
regard to the CLS. It is involved in the
oversight of the system and it provides
settlement services. Oversight of the CLS iscarried out by means of close collaborationbetween the G10 central banks and the FederalReserve System as the lead overseer.In September 2002 the CLS began settlingforeign exchange transactions in seven majorcurrencies on a payment versus payment (PVP)basis.8 In September 2003 four additional
currencies were added to the list of eligible
currencies.9 Following the start of live
operations, banks quickly increased the values
and volumes settled through the system. InDecember 2003 the CLS settled, on average,37,000 trades per day to the value of USD 550
billion. After the US dollar, the euro is the
second most important currency settled in this
system, accounting for about one-quarter of all
gross payments settled in the system.Thanks to the PVP mechanism, the CLSstrongly reduces foreign exchange settlement
risk. The Eurosystem welcomes this risk-
reducing factor. At the same time, however, the

CLS introduces a certain degree of liquidity
risk, as banks are required to make substantialpayments into the CLS at a specific time of theday (between 7 a.m. and 12 noon C.E.T.) and, in
the event of a malfunctioning of the system,
may not receive corresponding currencies as
expected. Banks have thus far handled these
liquidity requirements well. Their liquiditymanagement procedures seem to be welldeveloped, such that the liquidity demand
necessary to make CLS pay-ins has not had a
negative impact on the overall market.107The ECB cooperates with the other G10 central banks with
regard to oversight and, more specifically, systemically

important settlement infrastructures, the smooth functioning of
which is of vital importance beyond the euro area.8These currencies are the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen,
the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar and the
Australian dollar.9These currencies are the Danish krone, the Swedish krona, the
Norwegian krone and the Singapore dollar.10Average funding requirements fall in the range of several
hundred millions of euro. The largest pay-ins account for, on

average, around 1 billion, while the largest pay-in by anysingle bank thus far amounted to 5.9 billion. None of these pay-ins resulted in a negative impact on the euro money markets.122ECBAnnualReport
2003SWIFTThe Society for Worldwide Interbank FinancialTelecommunication (SWIFT) is a cooperative
organisation created and owned by banks which
operates a network to facilitate the exchange ofpayment and other financial messages betweenfinancial institutions throughout the entire
world. The ECB contributes to the oversight of

SWIFT, which is carried out by means of

cooperation between the G10 central banks and
the Nationale Bank van België/BanqueNationale de Belgique as the lead overseer.In addition to SWIFT™s resilience to crises,much oversight attention was paid to the
changeover to a new network generation (the
SWIFTNet migration), completion of which isscheduled by the end of 2004. SWIFT has kept
the overseers regularly informed of the status of

the network roll-out, of any incidents or of any
envisaged changes to the SWIFTNet migration
plan.CORRESPONDENT BANKINGBanks often have arrangements to provide
payments and related services to each

other primarily for payments across national
borders. Such arrangements are referred to
as correspondent banking. In the EU, euro

correspondent banking is a highly concentratedactivity among a few players. A recent surveyconducted by the ECB among a sample of banks
in the EU showed that the top 10% of reporting
banks accounted for almost 80% of the

value (34% of the volume) of the reported

correspondent banking payments in euro.There are even some indications of furtherconcentration of the correspondent banking
business.At this stage, the Eurosystem does not see any
immediate systemic risk in this high degree ofconcentration, as the share of correspondent
banking constitutes only a fraction of the
overall payment flows in euro. The large
majority of the payment flows are executed
via interbank funds transfer systems
(e.g. TARGET). However, in view of theEurosystem™s interest in the stability of the
financial system as a whole, it will continue tomonitor developments in this particular area of
business.4.2RETAIL PAYMENT SERVICES
OVERSIGHT OF RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS
In order to carry out its statutory task ofpromoting the smooth operation of payment
systems, the Eurosystem also refined its policy
stance on retail payment systems.Following a public consultation initiatedin 2002, the Governing Council adopted
ﬁOversight standards for euro retail payment

systemsﬂ on 26 June 2003, which can be found
together with the accompanying press releaseon the ECB™s website. These retail standards
are based on the Core Principles for
Systemically Important Payment Systems. The
adoption of standards in the field of retail
payment systems is aimed at fostering safety
and efficiency in this sector as well as atensuring the harmonised oversight of retail
payment systems in the euro area.The retail standards provide indicators forcategorising retail payment systems as
systemically important retail payment systems,retail systems of prominent importance andother retail payment systems. All Core
Principles will be applied to systemically
important retail payment systems, whereas only
a selection of six Core Principles will be applied
to systems of prominent importance. Other
retail payment systems will have to comply withother applicable standards (e.g. Eurosystem
standards for e-money schemes11 or standards
adopted at the national level).E-MONEY SYSTEMSA common oversight approach by the
Eurosystem with regard to e-money was
described in its report entitled ﬁElectronic
money system security objectivesﬂ in May11ﬁReport on electronic moneyﬂ, August 1998; ﬁElectronic money
system security objectivesﬂ, May 2003.123ECBAnnualReport
20032003. These security objectives should ensurethe overall reliability and technical safety of the
schemes and should also increase public
confidence in these systems. These objectives
were also designed with a view to achieving alevel playing-field for the different schemesfrom a regulatory point of view. All relevant
e-money schemes will be assessed against these
standards by the NCBs in the course of 2004.E-PAYMENTS
In recent years, the increasing use of new

communications technologies and the need for
specific payment mechanisms for e-commerce

have created opportunities for new
intermediaries to facilitate the sending and
processing of payment instructions. At the sametime, banks have also developed new means for
customers to access their accounts and to
originate payments.12 The ECB aims to provide
a forum for cooperation between stakeholders
and to offer analyses and statistics to support
the work of the markets in further developing
more efficient and secure payment mechanisms.Its oversight activities vis-à-vis the provisionof payments via the internet and mobile
networks will initially focus on the security of
the corresponding instruments and systems. In

order to achieve these objectives, in May 2003
the ECB relaunched the electronic PaymentSystems Observatory (ePSO). The ePSOproject was initially launched in 2000 under

the auspices of the European Commission. It
consists of a website used for sharing
information on innovative electronic payment
systems and instruments (www.e-pso.info) andcontains an electronic discussion forum, aninventory of e-payment schemes and articles on
topical subjects of interest.4.3SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT
SYSTEMSThe Eurosystem has thus far played two roles inthe field of securities clearing and settlement
systems. First, the Governing Council assesses
the compliance of EU SSSs with specific userstandards.13 These standards were established
in January 1998 with a view to mitigating
the risks to the Eurosystem when it conducts
its monetary policy operations. Second, the
Eurosystem cooperates with other authorities
responsible for the regulation and oversight ofsecurities clearing and settlement systems at theEU level. Contributions to the Giovannini

Group, a forum of financial experts which

advises the European Commission on financial
sector issues, were made and included in
the second Giovannini Report14. As regardsinternational cooperation, the ECB also tookpart in projects initiated by the Committee
on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS)

and the International Organization of
Securities Commissions (IOSCO) with a view

to developing recommendations for central
counterparties. Finally, the ECB contributed tothe CPSS ﬁReport on the role of central bank
money in payment systemsﬂ15.ASSESSMENT OF SECURITIES SETTLEMENT
SYSTEMSThe Eurosystem assesses EU SSSs eligible forthe settlement of its credit operations on anannual basis. These assessments are aimed at
limiting the risks to which the Eurosystem is

exposed during the settlement process. The
criteria used for these assessments can be found
in the report entitled ﬁStandards for the use ofEU securities settlement systems in ESCBcredit operationsﬂ, which was endorsed by the
EMI in November 1997 and comprises nine
standards.As part of the exercise carried out in 2003,22 SSSs were assessed (including four systemslocated in the three EU countries which have not
12For further details see the article entitled ﬁElectronification of
payments in Europeﬂ in the May 2003 issue of the ECB™s Monthly

Bulletin.13In the absence of EU harmonised oversight standards, the user
standards have been regarded as de facto common standards for
EU SSSs and, therefore, are dealt with in this chapter.

Nevertheless, the user standards are not intended to be a
comprehensive set of standards for the oversight or supervision
of SSSs.14ﬁSecond Report on EU Clearing and Settlement Arrangementsﬂ,

European Commission™s website at www.europa.eu.int.

2003yet joined the euro). By and large, thoseSSSs which were assessed complied with
the standards. However, in some cases
improvements are still necessary to achieve full
compliance. The Eurosystem acknowledges andis monitoring the efforts being made by thesystem operators to enhance compliance with
the standards. For example, efforts have been
made to increase operational reliability with
a special focus on business continuity in
the event of a disaster. Some systems have
increased the number of contingency sites andenhanced back-up facilities. Furthermore, in
some countries amendments have been made
to the legal framework to enhance the legal
soundness of their systems. Finally, efforts to
reduce the unwinding risk that can arise whentransactions are settled on a net basis have alsobeen made.COOPERATION WITH THE COMMITTEE OF

EUROPEAN SECURITIES REGULATORS
In 2001 the Governing Council approved a
framework for cooperation on securitiesclearing and settlement systems between theESCB and the Committee of European
Securities Regulators (CESR). In particular, a
working group was set up, composed of a
representative from each central bank of the

ESCB and from each securities regulator fromthe CESR.The work of the group focused mainly ondeveloping European standards for clearing
and settlement, based on the recommendations
of the CPSS and the IOSCO (referred toas ﬁCPSS-IOSCOﬂ). When developing thesestandards, the working group also took into
account the need to remove the barriers to
efficient cross-border clearing and settlement
processes in the EU, as identified in the above-
mentioned Giovannini Group reports.In 2003 the working group finalised aconsultative report consisting of a set of 19
standards aimed at increasing the safety,
soundness and efficiency of securities clearing
and settlement systems in the EU. A publicconsultation on these standards was conductedjointly by the ESCB and the CESR.In its report, the working group sought toadopt a functional approach, i.e. to apply thestandards to all relevant functions related to thesecurities clearing and settlement business,

without regard to the legal status of the
institutions exercising these functions. Thus the
future ESCB-CESR standards will apply to
securities market infrastructures and, inparticular, to central counterparties and nationaland international central securities depositories.
It is envisaged that some standards will also

apply to major custodian banks (ﬁsystemically
important custodiansﬂ) which are very active
in the field of clearing and settlement. Sincepreventing distortion is important whenidentifying ﬁsystemically importantﬂ entities,
the public consultation included a specific
questionnaire on the appropriateness of
including custodians and on how to identify
major custodians. The results of the public

consultation have been published on thewebsites of the ECB and the CESR. The reporton the ESCB-CESR standards is expected to be
finalised by mid-2004.ArtistJens FängeTitleJugend, 2003MaterialOil on canvasFormat132 × 122 cmCHAPTER  4
EUROPEAN AND
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
128ECBAnnualReport
2003In 2003 the ECB continued to maintain itsregular contacts with Community institutions
and bodies. ECB representatives attended
meetings of the ECOFIN Council when matters
relating to the tasks and objectives of the ESCBwere discussed. The President of the ECOFINCouncil and the relevant Commissioner also
made use of their right to participate in meetings
of the Governing Council when they deemed it
appropriate. The President of the ECB and the
governors of the NCBs participated in twoinformal meetings of the ECOFIN Council,which took place in Athens (Greece) and Stresa
(Italy) in April and September respectively. The
President of the ECB also participated regularly
in meetings of the Eurogroup, which has
continued to serve as a particularly importantforum for an open and informal policy dialoguebetween the ECB, the finance ministers of the
euro area countries and the Commission.
Moreover, the ECB continued to attend the
biannual meetings of the Macroeconomic
Dialogue, which brings together representatives
of the Member States, the Commission, theECB, the non-euro area central banks and theEU-level social partners.In addition to these relations at the politicallevel, the ECB continued to participate in
meetings of various European bodies at seniorexpert and working levels, including, mostnotably, the Economic and Financial Committee
(EFC), the Economic Policy Committee (EPC)
and the newly created Financial Services
Committee (FSC). The ECB closely followed
all discussions at the European level that wereof relevance for the pursuit of its tasks, takingpart, in particular, in discussions concerning
the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for
Europe (draft Constitution), the Broad
Economic Policy Guidelines and the Stability
and Growth Pact.1.1POLICY ISSUES
CONSTITUTION FOR EUROPEIn July 2003 the European Convention on thefuture of Europe (Convention) finalised thedraft Constitution and transmitted it tothe European Council. In accordance with
Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union
(TEU), the Italian Presidency of the Council
convened an Intergovernmental Conference(IGC) to discuss and formally adopt changes tothe existing Treaties. The IGC started its
proceedings in October. At the European

Council meeting on 12 and 13 December 2003,
the Heads of State or Government could not
reach an overall agreement on the draftConstitution. The European Council invited theIrish Presidency to make an assessment of
the prospects for progress and report to the
European Council in March 2004.The ECB followed the progress of both theConvention and the IGC very closely andcontributed to their deliberations on issues of
relevance to the tasks and mandate of the ECB
and the ESCB. These contributions included
two letters sent by the President of the ECB to
the Chairman of the Convention in May and
June 2003 to convey suggestions of theGoverning Council for improvements topreliminary drafts of the Constitution. Both
letters were made public on the ECB™s website.In the summer of 2003 the Italian Presidency ofthe Council transmitted the Convention™s draftConstitution to the Council as a formal proposalfor the amendment of the Treaties and formally
invited the ECB to deliver an opinion. The
competence of the ECB to deliver an opinion is
based on Article 48 of the TEU, which requires
the consultation of the ECB in the event ofinstitutional changes in the monetary area. On19 September the ECB delivered its opinion to
the Presidency of the Council.1 In this opinion,the ECB welcomed the draft Constitution as
simplifying, streamlining and clarifying the
legal and institutional framework of theEuropean Union. The ECB reaffirmed itsunderstanding that the necessary transfer of the
provisions on the ECB and the ESCB from the
present Treaty to the Constitution would not
entail any changes to the substance of their1CON/2003/20, OJ C 229, 25.9.2003, p. 7.

129ECBAnnualReport
2003tasks, mandate, status and legal regime. Whileattaching great value to institutional and
operational stability in the monetary domain,
the ECB also signalled its awareness of the fact
that a new Constitution had necessaryimplications for the institutional framework.However, it considered that the adjustments and
updates that the constitutional process was
envisaging did not affect that stability.Despite this generally positive assessment, theECB™s opinion identified some articles in thedraft Constitution which were of relevance for
the exercise of the ECB™s and ESCB™s functions
and tasks and would benefit from further
clarification and adjustment.The ECB™s principal suggestions were to
introduce a reference to ﬁnon-inflationary
growthﬂ or ﬁprice stabilityﬂ in Article I-3 (3) on
the Union™s objectives, to clarify the ECB™s
status in the institutional framework, to add a
reference to the ESCB and the Eurosystem in
the heading of Article I-29, which deals with
the ECB, the Eurosystem and the ESCB, torecognise the independence of NCBs in
this Article, to introduce a reference to the
widely recognised term ﬁEurosystemﬂ in the
draft Constitution and to add an explicit
reference to the responsibilities of the ESCB inArticle III-90 on the external representation ofthe euro.The ECB intervened formally in thenegotiations of the IGC on one occasion. The
Council Presidency had proposed tosignificantly extend the current simplified
amendment procedure for changes to Article
10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB (for further
details regarding the current procedure, see
Chapter 8). The new procedure would have
covered any change to the basic provisionsgoverning the decision-making bodies of theECB and allowed for amendments to be made
without ratification by the Member States. In a
letter to the President of the EU Council dated

26 November 2003, the ECB™s President
emphasised that the Governing Council hadserious concerns about this proposal, regardingit as a far-reaching change to the current
constitution of the ESCB. As a result, the
Council Presidency decided to drop the
proposal.2003 BROAD ECONOMIC POLICY GUIDELINESThe Broad Economic Policy Guidelines adopted
in 2003 by the ECOFIN Council not only called
for continued sound public finances but also

placed considerable emphasis on structural
reforms. In line with the Lisbon strategy,
Member States were urged to pursue policiesaimed at integrating capital markets and to
increase competition in goods and services

markets. In addition to recommendations to
improve the functioning of labour markets
through sound wage bargaining arrangementsand effective tax and benefit systems, the BroadEconomic Policy Guidelines also paid special
attention to the long-term sustainability of public
finances in view of the ageing of the population
of the EU. From a procedural point of view,
the 2003 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines
were for the first time adopted for a three-yearperiod, from 2003 to 2005 (as were theEmployment Guidelines). This new procedure
reflects a desire to pay greater attention to the
implementation of policies, rather than to the
frequent adoption of new guidelines.The ECB was involved in the discussions on theBroad Economic Policy Guidelines through its
participation in the EFC and the EPC. In this
context, the ECB welcomed the focus of the
Guidelines on stability-oriented macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms as well as theincreased emphasis on their implementation. Inits public statements and publications, the ECB
continuously stressed that the implementation
of structural reforms needed to be accelerated in
order to enhance the growth potential of the

euro area. In particular, the ECB sought to raiseawareness of the need to reform labour marketsand integrate financial markets (see also Box 5).ECOFIN COUNCIL REPORT ON STRENGTHENING
THE COORDINATION OF BUDGETARY POLICIES
In November 2002, in response to a request by
the European Council, the Commission130ECBAnnualReport
2003presented proposals to strengthen thecoordination of budgetary policies. The

ECOFIN Council subsequently reviewed the
Commission™s proposals and, in March 2003,
adopted its own ﬁReport on strengthening the
coordination of budgetary policiesﬂ. In itsreport, the ECOFIN Council agreed with the
Commission that there was no need to change
either the Treaty or the Stability and Growth
Pact, or to introduce new budgetary objectives
or rules. At the same time, the ECOFIN Councilshared the Commission™s view that there wereareas where implementation could be improved.
For example, the ECOFIN Council felt that,
while the monitoring of nominal balances
continued to be essential, compliance with the
close-to-balance-or-in-surplus requirement ofthe Stability and Growth Pact should be
assessed in cyclically adjusted terms.
Moreover, the ECOFIN Council considered
that, when assessing Member States™ budgetary
policies, attention should be paid to country-
specific circumstances, such as the quality and
long-term sustainability of public finances andthe safety margin needed to prevent a breach ofthe deficit reference value of 3% of GDP. The

ECOFIN Council also stressed that countries

with deficits exceeding the close-to-balance-or-
in-surplus requirement of the Stability and
Growth Pact must improve their cyclicallyadjusted budget position. In this context, theECOFIN Council recalled the Eurogroup
agreement of 7 October 2002 that euro area
countries whose deficits exceed the close-to-
balance-or-in-surplus requirement should
reduce their underlying deficits by at least 0.5%of GDP per year.
Throughout the discussions on the
Commission™s proposals, the ECB stressed that
the rules and procedures of the Stability and
Growth Pact provide an appropriate frameworkfor fiscal policies in EMU. The ECB therefore
fully supported the view of the ECOFIN
Council that changes to the Stability and
Growth Pact were not warranted.IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STABILITY AND

GROWTH PACTIn 2003 the implementation of the Stability and
Growth Pact was at a critical juncture. In an
economic environment that was less favourablethan previously expected, those Member Statesthat had failed to reach sound budgetary
positions during the previous upturn found it
increasingly difficult Œ and, in some cases, were
already seen to have failed Œ to respect the
deficit reference value of 3% of GDP. In 2002the ECOFIN Council had decided that anexcessive deficit existed in Portugal and issued
a recommendation to Portugal with a view to

bringing the situation of an excessive deficit to

an end by 2003 at the latest. During 2003 the
excessive deficit procedure for Portugal washeld in abeyance pending this correction (seeBox 11 for an overview of the excessive deficit

procedure).In January 2003 the ECOFIN Counciladopted a decision on the existence of an
excessive deficit in Germany and issued arecommendation to Germany with a view tobringing the situation of an excessive deficit to

an end. The ECOFIN Council recommended
that the German authorities adopt the corrective

measures foreseen in their budgetary plans
amounting to 1% of GDP in 2003 and that the
excessive deficit be corrected as rapidly aspossible and by 2004 at the latest.The deficit and debt figures certified byEurostat in March 2003 subsequently showed
that France™s budget deficit also exceeded the3% of GDP reference value in 2002. As a
consequence, the ECOFIN Council adopted a
decision in June 2003 on the existence of an
excessive deficit in France and issued a

recommendation to France with a view to
bringing the situation of an excessive deficit to
an end. The ECOFIN Council recommendedthat the French authorities achieve a
significantly larger improvement than planned
at the time in the cyclically adjusted deficit in
2003, and that the excessive deficit be corrected
as rapidly as possible and by 2004 at the latest.131ECBAnnualReport
2003In view of continued adverse fiscal
developments in France and Germany, the
Commission decided in October and November
to initiate the next steps of the excessive deficit
procedures for these countries. To this end, theCommission issued recommendations forCouncil decisions on whether effective action
had been taken or was proving adequate, and
recommendations for Council decisions giving
notice to France and Germany to take the
necessary measures to reduce their deficits. TheCommission expressed the view that France hadnot taken effective action, while the action taken
by Germany was deemed inadequate. The
Commission recommended extending the
deadline for France and Germany to correct
their excessive deficits from 2004 to 2005,citing worse than expected economic conditionsin these countries.At its meeting on 25 November 2003, theECOFIN Council decided not to adopt the
decisions recommended by the Commission,
explaining this action on the basis of both theworse than expected economic climate and thebudgetary commitments made by the French and
German governments. Instead, it adopted
Council conclusions in which it decided to hold
the excessive deficit procedures in abeyance
and called on France and Germany to takemeasures that would ensure the correction oftheir excessive deficits by 2005.In a statement issued immediately after theECOFIN Council meeting on 25 November, the
Governing Council expressed its deep regretregarding the decisions taken by the ECOFINCouncil. The Governing Council warned that
the failure of the ECOFIN Council to follow the

rules and procedures foreseen in the Stability
and Growth Pact risked undermining the
credibility of the institutional framework and
confidence in the soundness of the publicfinances of countries across the euro area.
Noting the budgetary commitments by France
and Germany, the Governing Council urged
the governments concerned to live up to
their responsibilities, pointing out that it was
imperative that action be taken to limit negative
effects on confidence. The Governing Councilalso reassured the public that it remained
committed to maintaining price stability.On 28 January 2004 the Commission broughtan action before the European Court of Justice,challenging the ECOFIN Council conclusions

of 25 November 2003 with a view to seeking

legal clarity regarding the application of the

relevant provisions of the Stability and Growth

Pact. The ECB shares the concerns of theCommission regarding the ECOFIN Councilconclusions and respects the Commission™s
decision to seek legal clarity in this matter.On the same day the Commission announcedthat it would put forward proposals tostrengthen economic governance in the euroarea, including improvements to the
implementation of the Stability and Growth
Pact. In this regard, the Governing Council
does not see a need for changes to the Treaty,
and the Stability and Growth Pact in its current
form is appropriate in its view. The ECB is inagreement with the Commission that theimplementation of the Stability and Growth Pact

could be further improved, in particular as

regards the analysis of structural balances and
strengthening incentives for sound fiscal
policies in good times. The clarity and
enforceability of the fiscal rules should also beenhanced.1.2INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES RELATING TO
RELEVANT EUROPEAN BODIES
On 16 April 2003 the Accession Treaty was
signed, paving the way for the entry of ten new
Member States into the EU as of 1 May 2004.
As is customary following the signing of an

accession treaty, representatives of the accedingcountries have been granted observer status in
those Community institutions and bodies in
which Member States are represented. They will
become full members of these institutions and
bodies on the date of accession.132ECBAnnualReport
2003Box 11THE EXCESSIVE DEFICIT PROCEDUREThe excessive deficit procedure lays down the steps to be taken to assess and decide whether anexcessive deficit exists and to ensure its timely correction. It is based on Article 104 of the
Treaty and on Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and
clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. The latter is part of the
Stability and Growth Pact.When the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to GDP exceeds a reference value of3% and this excess is not small and temporary, or if the ratio of government debt to GDP
exceeds a reference value of 60% and is not diminishing at a satisfactory pace, the Commission
prepares a report. The EFC prepares an opinion on this report and, if the Commission considers

that an excessive deficit exists, the Commission addresses an opinion to the ECOFIN Council.On the basis of a recommendation by the Commission, the ECOFIN Council adopts a decisionon whether or not an excessive deficit exists. If an excessive deficit is deemed to exist, the

ECOFIN Council recommends that the Member State concerned correct its excessive deficit and
sets a deadline of no more than four months for the Member State to adopt corrective measures.
The ECOFIN Council also sets a deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit, which
should be completed in the year following its identification unless there are specialcircumstances. If the Member State adopts the recommended measures, the procedure is held inabeyance and the Commission and ECOFIN Council monitor their implementation. If the
measures are not adopted, the ECOFIN Council takes a decision to this effect and, within one
month, gives notice to the Member State to take measures to reduce the deficit. The content of
the notice may or may not differ from that of the earlier recommendation depending on

developments in the meantime. If these measures are adopted, the procedure is again held inabeyance and the Commission and the ECOFIN Council monitor their implementation. If,
however, the necessary measures are not adopted within a period of no more than two months,
as set by the ECOFIN Council, the ECOFIN Council takes a decision to impose sanctions.
When the ECOFIN Council decides to impose sanctions, as a rule, a non-interest-bearing
deposit is required. If the excessive deficit is not corrected after two years, the deposit is, as a
rule, converted into a fine.In summary, the excessive deficit procedure consists of three main steps. First, the decision thatan excessive deficit exists and the issuing of recommendations by the ECOFIN Council to the
Member State concerned. Second, a notice by the ECOFIN Council to the Member State to take
measures to reduce the deficit. And, third, the imposition of sanctions. If it emerges at any point
in time that the measures adopted by the Member State are not being implemented or are noteffective, the ECOFIN Council proceeds to the next step of the procedure. The potential
imposition of sanctions provides the ultimate incentive for the Member State to correct its
excessive deficit in a timely manner.133ECBAnnualReport
2003In order to ensure that they will continue tofunction effectively after enlargement, both the

EFC and the EPC reviewed their composition
and working methods in the first half of 2003.
Following these reviews, on 18 June 2003 theECOFIN Council amended the statutes of thesetwo committees. In the case of the EPC, it was
decided to reduce the number of members that
each delegation appoints to the committee.
Whereas previously the Member States, the
Commission and the ECB could each appoint upto four members, the number of members perdelegation has been reduced to two under the
new statutes. In the case of the EFC, by
contrast, it was decided to leave the membership
of the committee unchanged. The Member
States, the Commission and the ECB will
continue to appoint two members each.Moreover, the two members appointed by each
of the Member States will continue to be
selected from among senior officials from,
respectively, the administration and the NCB.
However, it was decided to vary participation in

meetings of the committee depending on theissues discussed. Whenever the committeediscusses issues related to the tasks and
expertise of NCBs, the committee will meet in

its ﬁfull compositionﬂ, with all members

present. Otherwise, the committee may meet in
its ﬁrestricted compositionﬂ, with only themembers from administrations, the Commissionand the ECB attending. The committee deems it
important to retain the expertise and analytical
insight of the NCBs, and to keep them involved
in issues for which they bear responsibility.The review of the EFC™s working methods tookplace not only in view of enlargement, but also
against the background of the new EU
arrangements for financial stability, regulation
and supervision (see Section 2 of Chapter 3). In
this regard, at its meeting on 3 December 2002the ECOFIN Council asked the EFC to report toit on financial stability issues. In response to
this mandate, the EFC now undertakes regular
reviews of financial stability. Relevant non-
members, including the Chairman of the
ESCB™s Banking Supervision Committee,attend the meetings dedicated to this review.In February 2003 the ECOFIN Council
established the FSC, which replaced the former
Financial Services Policy Group. It reports to
the EFC and has the task of providing advice to

the ECOFIN Council and the Commission on awide range of policy issues affecting financialmarkets. The ECB has been granted observer
status in the FSC.134ECBAnnualReport
2003The ECB and NCBs continued to participate in
the process of monetary, financial and economic

cooperation at the international level.
The arrangements for the international
representation of the ECB remained unchanged.Within the EU, the coordination of international
macroeconomic and financial issues continued
in the context of the EFC, as well as among the
IMF Executive Directors representing the EU
Member States, including the ECB Observer.On 29 May 2003 the President of the UnitedStates issued an executive order extending to
the ECB the privileges, exemptions and
immunities provided to public international

organisations under the ﬁInternational

Organizations Immunities Actﬂ of 1945. Thisfollowed the passage by the US Congress inNovember 2002 of legislation providing for the

applicability of this Act to the ECB. The new
legal framework should not only ensure better

protection of the ECB™s assets held in the
United States, but also facilitate a further

strengthening of bilateral relations withrelevant US institutions.2.1INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AND FINANCIAL
SYSTEMMULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL SURVEILLANCE
OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIESThe ECB regularly exchanged information and
views on economic developments and policies
with policy-makers outside the euro area and
with international institutions. The Presidentof the ECB, together with the EurogroupPresidency, participated in the global
surveillance and exchange rate sessions of the
meetings of G7 finance ministers and central

bank governors. The President of the ECB also
participated in the discussions on the state ofthe world economy in other fora, such as themeetings of the G10 governors, which he
currently chairs, and those of the ministers and

governors of the G10 and the G20. At the IMF,
the ECB Observer took part in the IMF
Executive Board™s discussions on the world
economic outlook and its regular reviews of2INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
world economic and market developments.Finally, at the OECD, the ECB participated in

the activities of the Economic Policy

Committee, which focused on global economic
developments, prospects and policyrequirements.The IMF and the OECD conducted their regularreviews of the monetary, financial and

economic policies of the euro area. The IMF

decided to streamline, from 2003 onwards, its
surveillance of euro area policies by reducingthe number of fully-fledged Article IV
consultations on those policies from two to one
per year. The IMF also decided that IMF staff
would continue to carry out two missions per

year to the euro area authorities, including theECB, but that the IMF Executive Board woulddiscuss the outcome of the second mission only
informally. The fully-fledged Article IV report

on euro area policies, prepared by IMF staff,
was published in September 2003.In July 2003 the OECD published its Economic
Survey of the Euro Area, which reviewed recent
developments and short-term prospects, as well
as fiscal, monetary and structural policies, and
included a study on product market competition
policies. The survey, prepared by an OECD
team on the basis of, inter alia, a visit to theECB, was finalised by the Economic andDevelopment Review Committee of the OECD
in which the Eurogroup Presidency, the
European Commission and the ECB jointly
represented the EU.MONITORING OF DEVELOPMENTS IN GLOBAL

FINANCIAL MARKETSA number of international organisations and

fora monitor global financial market
developments. In 2003 the ECB and NCBs
participated in these monitoring activities,providing their own analysis and views,particularly in the Financial Stability Forum
(FSF), the BIS-based Committee on the Global
Financial System (CGFS) and the OECD™s
Committee on Financial Markets.135ECBAnnualReport
2003The ECB Observer participated in the IMFExecutive Board discussions on the IMF™s
Global Financial Stability Reports. The ECB
also participated as a member or observer in the
work of a number of international institutionsand fora on specific aspects of the functioningof international financial markets. The FSF
reviewed issues related to the reinsurance
industry, credit risk transfers, audit practices,
accounting standards, corporate governance and
offshore financial centres. The Basel Committeeon Banking Supervision continued its work onthe new Capital Accord (see Section 2 of
Chapter 3). The CGFS published reports on
ﬁCredit risk transferﬂ and ﬁIncentive structures
in institutional asset management and their
implications for financial marketsﬂ andlaunched work on studying the role of ratingagencies in the area of structured finance and
foreign direct investment in the financial
sectors of emerging market economies. The
ECB also took part in the activities of the
Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
(CPSS), which is chaired by a member of theECB™s Executive Board (see Section 4 ofChapter 3).INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE
The ESCB contributed with its own assessment
and analysis to the ongoing discussions on thearchitecture of the international financialsystem in the IMF and related fora, both

through direct participation and through its

involvement in EU coordination.
This included work on the promotion ofeconomic and financial stability, inter aliathrough improved debt sustainability

assessments and greater attention to potential
balance sheet weaknesses in emerging market
economies.The international community also studied thecontribution of institution-building to economic
performance. In that context, the G20 held a
discussion on the role of institution-building in
the financial sector on the basis of case studies

prepared by a number of G20 members,including an ECB contribution on experiencewith financial integration in the EU.2With regard to the orderly resolution of
financial crises in emerging market economies,the IMF completed its review of access policy,
i.e. the rules for determining the volume of
financial assistance to be given to a member
country that is experiencing balance of payment
difficulties. The IMF Executive Board agreed
on a number of procedural requirements andsubstantive criteria governing access to itsresources beyond the normal limits, which are
proportional to the quota assigned to each IMF
member country.The debate continued on procedures to facilitateorderly sovereign debt restructuring. The ESCBtook the view that further progress was

desirable with respect to the three broad groups

of instruments that had been proposed.3 One
proposal involved modifying the contractual
framework by including collective action
clauses (CACs) aimed at facilitating coordination
among creditors. This proposal is already beingimplemented. In the course of 2003 there was
significant progress towards a more widespread

inclusion of CACs in sovereign bonds issued

under foreign jurisdictions. In an effort to lead
by example, the EU Member States committed
themselves to including such CACs in
their relevant issues. A second proposal was
the establishment of a Sovereign Debt
Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM), a type of
international bankruptcy procedure which
would have been embedded in international law.At the spring meeting of the IMFC in April2003, however, it became clear that there was
insufficient political support for the creation of
even a soft version of such a mechanism.
Nevertheless, it remains to be explored to what
extent specific features of the SDRM Œ such asthe enhancement of transparency and disclosure,2ﬁGlobalisation: The role of institution building in the financial

2003aggregation across debt issues and the creationof a dispute resolution forum Œ could be
replicated outside an international legal
framework. A third proposal was to develop a
code of conduct to be implemented on a
voluntary basis, which would set out bestpractices and guidelines for borrowers, lenders
and the international official community. Work
is currently ongoing on the drafting of such a
code.
THE INTERNATIONAL ROLE OF THE EURO
In 2003 the ECB continued its analysis of the
international role of the euro.4 It undertook
work to improve its statistical framework and
its analytical understanding of the use of the
euro by non-euro area residents. New data weremade available, in particular on the currency
breakdown of the external trade of selected euro
area countries, on daily foreign exchange
transactions settled through Continuous Linked
Settlement (CLS) and on the euro™s role in the
international loan market.The ECB also launched work in 2003 onanalysing at the microeconomic level the
markets where the euro is mostly used by non-

euro area residents. Particular attention was
paid to the City of London™s contribution to the
role of the euro in financial markets outside the
euro area. Overall, the results of this reviewconfirmed that the international role of the euro
continues to grow gradually, that it is
characterised by a strong regional focus and

that it is, to a certain extent, driven by the euro
area itself.The results also provided a clearer picture of both
the geographical distribution of the users of
the euro and the extent of its global role. In
countries that are geographically remote from
Europe, agents have thus far used the europrimarily to borrow funds (issuance ofdebt securities) and in foreign exchange
transactions. Large US corporations have been
very active issuers of euro-denominated bonds
since the start of Stage Three of EMU, in
particular to diversify their investor base.
Financial centres in the United States and Asiatogether accounted for a not insignificantproportion of foreign exchange activity in euro.
There are indications that financial market
participants from some of these countries tend
to use the City of London as an entry point fortheir euro-denominated financial activities. Inaddition, according to market sources, demand
from Asian investors for euro-denominated
bonds issued by non-euro area residents
increased in 2003, which points to a broader
role of the euro as an international investmentcurrency. However, the use of the euro as aninternational currency remains most prominent
in countries neighbouring the euro area. In
financial markets outside the euro area, a major
role is played by the City of London. The share
of the City of London in financial activity ineuro by non-euro area residents typically rangesfrom one-third to two-thirds. Finally, additional

evidence gained in 2003 suggests that the euro
area is itself an important determinant of the
international role of its currency, as it is a large
and financially open economy.
 Since the startof Stage Three of EMU, euro-denominatedbonds issued by non-euro area residents haveto a significant extent been targeted at and

purchased by euro area investors. Moreover,
work conducted in 2003 highlighted that euro
area-owned banks are among the largest players
in euro-denominated markets in the City ofLondon, thereby contributing substantially tothe euro™s role in financial markets outside the
euro area.2.2COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE
THE EUAs part of its international activities, the ECB
continued in 2003 to develop a broad range of
bilateral relations as well as contacts in
multilateral frameworks with countries invarious other regions of the world. In the EU™sbroad geographical neighbourhood, the ECB
extended cooperation with Russia, Turkey, the
Mediterranean region, the Middle East and4See ﬁReview of the international role of the euroﬂ, ECB,

2003Africa. Furthermore, relations with keyemerging market economies in Asia and the
Pacific and in Latin America were deepened.In November 2003 the Eurosystem startedimplementing a two-year project to provide
technical assistance to the Central Bank of
Russia (CBR), funded by the European Union
within the framework of its programme of

Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of
Independent States (TACIS programme). Theproject covers banking supervision and
regulation, inspection and licensing, as well as

bank rehabilitation. It draws on the vast
experience which NCBs and supervisory
authorities in the EU have in the field of
banking supervision. Nine NCBs
5 and three EU
non-central bank supervisors6 will assign
experts to provide training to around 400
members of the staff and management of the
CBR over 24 months. The training will consist
of courses and seminars, most of which will
take place in Moscow at the CBR premises, as
well as study visits by CBR experts to EUcountries. The ECB is coordinating the project.With this project, the Eurosystem intends to
contribute to further strengthening the CBR™s

banking supervision function as a key measure
to foster a more stable financial environment.The ECB continued its high-level policydialogue with the Central Bank of the Republic
of Turkey (CBRT). Turkey currently has the
status of a candidate country for EU accession.
7The discussions with the CBRT focused on
Turkey™s macroeconomic stabilisation process,the planned introduction of a formal inflation-targeting framework by the CBRT and the
economic situation in the euro area. In addition
to the policy dialogue, technical cooperation

between various business areas of the ECB and
the CBRT continued throughout 2003.Over the past few years, the ECB hasestablished bilateral relations with central
banks in the Mediterranean region. In October
2003 the ECB, in cooperation with the Banca
d™Italia, organised a technical workshop forrepresentatives of the central banks of the5The Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banco de España, the Banque de

December 2004 decided that Turkey fulfilled the Copenhagen

political criteria, the EU would open accession negotiations with

was in preparation for a high-level Eurosystem
seminar involving governors of Mediterranean
central banks, which took place in January 2004
in Naples. This seminar focused on economicand financial relations between the euro areaand the Mediterranean countries, on exchange
rate arrangements and on financial sector
reforms highlighted by the workshop
participants.In the Middle East, the ECB further developedits relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) in view of the intention of the six GCC
member states9 to launch a single currency by
2010. In June the ECB participated in a meeting
in Qatar of the GCC technical committee taskedwith preparing for monetary union.In 2003 bilateral relations with central banks inAfrica continued to focus on issues related to

monetary unions. Several events provided the
ECB with the opportunity to contribute to the
discussions in the region on the basis of the
experience of EMU. The ECB was invited toparticipate in meetings of the Committee for the
Institutional Reform of the West African
Monetary Union,10 which were held at the
Banque Centrale des Etats de l™Afrique de
l™Ouest (BCEAO) in Dakar, Senegal. TheCommittee, which includes experts from theBCEAO, other central banks, governments and
academia, is mandated to examine the BCEAO138ECBAnnualReport
2003statutes and the institutional set-up of themonetary area without prejudice to the existing
exchange rate arrangement. Moreover, the ECB
participated in the forum for finance ministers

of the West African Monetary Zone11 that was
held in Accra, Ghana, to follow progresstowards monetary integration between English-
speaking countries in the region. The ECB
additionally attended the annual governors™

forum of the Macroeconomic and Financial
Management Institute of Eastern and SouthernAfrica, which brought together, in Basel,
central bank governors from 12 African
countries. The forum discussed existing

regional monetary union projects in Africa, as

well as the lessons on monetary integration to
be drawn from EMU.In the course of the year, bilateral relations withEast Asia were further strengthened, not least
by a visit by a member of the Executive Board to
Korea, Japan and Indonesia. The ECB also
participated in the fifth Asia-Europe (ASEM)
Finance Ministers™ Meeting in Bali, Indonesia,in July 2003. The contribution of the ECBfocused on economic integration in the East
Asian region, the role of central banks in crisis
management and European experience with
regulation and cooperation in pursuing financial
stability.In 2003 the ECB became a ﬁcollaboratingmemberﬂ of the Centre for Latin American

Monetary Studies (CEMLA), after having
participated in an increasing number of CEMLA
conferences and meetings since 1999. One ofthe main objectives of CEMLA is to promote abetter understanding of monetary and banking
matters in Latin America and the Caribbean, as
well as to inform on developments in regional
and international monetary and financial
policies. CEMLA also initiated a project topromote convergence at a sub-regional
grouping level.11Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

ACCOUNTABILITY
142ECBAnnualReport
2003Over the past decades, central bankindependence has emerged as a key institutional
feature of the economic policy frameworks of

industrialised countries. The decision to grant
central banks independence from politicalinfluence is firmly grounded in historicalexperience, economic theory and empirical
evidence, which shows that central bank
independence is conducive to maintaining price
stability and thus contributes to overall
economic welfare.At the same time, it is a fundamental principle
of democratic societies that public authorities
need to be accountable to the general public,
from which their mandate and independence
ultimately derive. Accountability can beunderstood as the legal and institutionalobligation of an independent central bank to
explain its decisions clearly and thoroughly to
citizens and their elected representatives,
thereby holding the central bank responsible for
achieving its objectives.The Treaty establishing the European Community,which lays down the tasks and objectives of the
ESCB, has been ratified by all EU Member

States in line with their national constitutional
requirements. Thus, the European citizens have
endowed the ESCB with the mandate to maintainprice stability and, without prejudice to this
primary objective, to support the general economic

policies of the Community. At the same time, the

Treaty contains precise reporting requirements,
which allow the European public and their elected
representatives to hold the ECB responsible forattaining these objectives. This institutional set-up
has been reconfirmed by the Convention on
the future of Europe and included in the draft
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (see
Section 1 of Chapter 4).From its inception, the ECB has acknowledgedthe fundamental importance of its accountability
obligations and therefore maintains a regular
dialogue with European citizens and their

elected representatives. This commitment is
reflected, inter alia, in the numerous publicspeeches held by members of the Governing1ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE GENERAL
PUBLICCouncil throughout the euro area in 2003. Such
contacts with European citizens allow the

Eurosystem to explain the Governing Council™s

policy decisions and to directly address any
issues or concerns.
Beyond such direct contacts with Europeancitizens, the Treaty lays down a number of
reporting obligations for the ECB, of which the
Annual Report Œ addressed to the European
Parliament, the EU Council, the Commission andthe European Council Œ is one example. Other
reporting requirements include the publication of
a quarterly report and a weekly financial
statement. The ECB exceeds these requirements
by publishing comprehensive bulletins on a
monthly basis. At the institutional level, theTreaty assigns a prominent role to the EuropeanParliament with regard to the accountability of
the ECB (see Section 2 of this chapter).In several respects, accountability is closely
related to transparency. Transparency means
not only releasing information, but alsostructuring that information in such a way thatthe public can understand it. Transparency
facilitates the process of holding central banks
accountable for their actions. The ECB regards
transparency as a crucial component of its
monetary policy framework. Transparencyrequires central banks to clearly explain howthey interpret and implement their mandates.
This helps the public to monitor and evaluate a
central bank™s performance. It also requires an
explanation both of the analytical framework
used for its internal decision-making andassessment of the state of the economy andof the economic rationale underlying its policy
decisions. Transparency is strongly enhanced
by means of a publicly announced monetary

policy strategy. In line with these
considerations, the ECB announced its monetarypolicy strategy in 1998. This strategy wasconfirmed and clarified in May 2003, following
a thorough evaluation by the Governing Council
(see Section 1 of Chapter 1). The ECB
thereby provided the general public with a
clear benchmark against which the ECB™sperformance can be assessed.143ECBAnnualReport
2003Transparency can render monetary policy more
effective for several reasons. First, a central
bank can foster credibility by being clear about
the interpretation of its mandate and how it goes
about achieving it. When a central bank isperceived as being determined and capable ofachieving its policy mandate, it helps to anchor
expectations about future price developments.
If, in turn, expectations are well anchored at
levels compatible with price stability, there is
less reason for economic agents to deviate fromthe assumption of price stability when settingwages or prices and there is also a lower risk of
an inflationary or deflationary wage-price spiral
developing.Second, a strong commitment to transparencyimposes self-discipline on policy-makers,which, in turn, helps to ensure that their policy
decisions and explanations are consistent over
time. Facilitating public scrutiny of monetary
policy decisions enhances the incentives for
decision-making bodies to fulfil their mandates
in an appropriate and consistent manner.Third, by publicly announcing its monetarypolicy strategy and communicating its regular
assessment of economic developments, the
central bank provides guidance to the markets
so that expectations can be formed moreefficiently and accurately. This helps financialmarkets to better understand the response
pattern of monetary policy to economic
developments and thus to anticipate the broad

direction of monetary policy over the medium
term. This, in turn, should contribute tosmoothing financial market developments.In order to ensure that it is both accountable andtransparent, the ECB uses a variety of
communication tools, which go far beyond the
reporting requirements laid down in the Treaty
and which are explained in more detail inChapter 6.11For a more detailed discussion of accountability and
transparency, see the November 2002 issue of the Monthly

Bulletin.144ECBAnnualReport
20032.1OVERVIEW OF RELATIONS WITH THE
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN 2003In line with the provisions of Article 113 of the
Treaty, the ECB continued to report regularly tothe European Parliament on the decisions takenin the field of monetary policy and its other

tasks. As in past years, the main forum for the

exchange of views between the ECB and the
European Parliament were the quarterly

testimonies by the President of the ECB beforethe Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs. The President was also invited to
present the ECB™s Annual Report 2002 at the
plenary session of the European Parliament.Moreover, in line with common practice, othermembers of the Executive Board were alsoinvited to appear before the European

Parliament for an exchange of views on a
variety of topics. In April 2003 the Vice-
President presented the ECB™s Annual Report
2002 to the Committee on Economic and
Monetary Affairs. In March the Committeeon Economic and Monetary Affairs heardMr Issing™s views on the economic
environment and on the draft Broad Economic
Policy Guidelines for 2003-2005.Beyond the scope of its Treaty obligations, theECB continued its voluntary practice of
replying to written questions submitted by
members of the European Parliament on issues
regarding the fulfilment of the ECB™s mandate.Finally, the role of the European Parliament inthe appointment of a new President and othermembers of the Executive Board should also be
mentioned. Article 112 of the Treaty stipulates
that the European Parliament shall give its
opinion on candidates prior to their appointment
by common accord of the governments of theMember States at the level of Heads of State orGovernment. In order to prepare its opinions,
the European Parliament invited Mr Trichet and

Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell to appear before the
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs
to present their views and answer questionsfrom Committee members. Following these2ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENThearings, the plenary of the EuropeanParliament endorsed both appointments.2.2VIEWS OF THE ECB ON SELECTED TOPICS
RAISED AT MEETINGS WITH THE EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENTWhile the testimonies before the Committee on

Economic and Monetary Affairs covered a wide
range of policy areas, the main focus was on the
ECB™s monetary policy decisions and itsassessment of the economic and monetary
developments underlying these decisions. The
following sub-sections deal with other
important issues raised by the European
Parliament and recall the views presented by theECB. Many of these issues are also addressedin the European Parliament resolution of 3 July

2003 on the Annual Report presented by the
ECB last year.REFORM OF THE VOTING MODALITIES OF THE

GOVERNING COUNCILIn accordance with Article 10.6 of the Statute of

the ESCB, on 3 February 2003 the ECB
submitted a recommendation to the EU Council
for a reform of the voting modalities of the
Governing Council (see Section 1 of Chapter 8
for further details). The above-mentionedArticle also stipulates that the EuropeanCommission and the European Parliament shall
be consulted prior to any decision by the EU

Council. In February 2003 the President of the
ECB presented the recommendation to the
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.During the debate, the recommendation metwith criticism.In its opinion of 13 March 2003, the EuropeanParliament rejected the ECB™s recommendation
and suggested maintaining the existing rules,whereby all NCB governors of the Eurosystemhave the right to vote in the Governing Council.In March 2003 the EU Council meeting in the
composition of the Heads of State or
Government unanimously adopted the newvoting modalities of the Governing Council,145ECBAnnualReport
2003endorsing the ECB™s recommendation. Thereform of the voting modalities will enter into
force following ratification by all Member
States in accordance with their respective
constitutional requirements. The new voting
modalities will apply once the number ofNCB governors in the Governing Council
exceeds 15.EVALUATION OF THE ECB™S MONETARY POLICY

STRATEGY
The President reported to the European
Parliament on the outcome of the Governing

Council™s evaluation of the ECB™s monetary
policy strategy (for further details, see
Section 1 of Chapter 1). A number of members
of the Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs welcomed the confirmation andclarification of the strategy, in particular as

regards the definition of price stability, and said
it ensured the continuity of the ECB™s policy.

Other Committee members raised the issue of
whether the ECB™s monetary policy strategy
was symmetric in terms of avoiding bothinflation and deflation, and whether the ECB™s
definition of price stability would take
sufficient account of a potential measurement

bias in the HICP.The President explained that the ECB wouldcontinue to remain vigilant in terms of avoidingboth inflation and deflation. In this respect, the
recent clarification that, in the pursuit of price
stability, the Governing Council would aim to
maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2%
of an annual increase in the HICP over themedium term, ensured a significant andadequate safety margin to guard against the risk
of deflation. He added that, although the size of

the measurement bias in the euro area was still
uncertain, available studies indicated that it was
likely to be limited. By making it clear that pricestability should be maintained over the mediumterm, the ECB took account of the fact that it
was impossible for a central bank to fine-tune
short-term price developments and that these
could therefore temporarily exceed the level of
price increases regarded as compatible withprice stability.In its resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report
2002, the European Parliament welcomed the
evaluation of the ECB™s monetary policy

strategy and expressed its belief ﬁthat
the clarifications will strengthen theappropriateness of the policy strategy for theyears to comeﬂ.ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY
Accountability and transparency once again
figured prominently in the exchanges betweenthe ECB and the European Parliament. The
views of both institutions remained, in
substance, unchanged. In its resolution on the
ECB™s Annual Report 2002, the European
Parliament reiterated its call for both the
publication of summary minutes and the balanceof votes in Governing Council meetings.The President recalled that the ECB™s policy onthese issues reflected the specific institutional
environment in which the ECB operated, with
monetary policy decisions being taken at the
euro area level and economic policies remaining
largely the responsibility of the individualMember States. Given that this arrangement ran
the risk of making Governing Council members
seem like national representatives, the ECB had

decided not to provide any indications that
could reveal Œ or lead to speculations about Œindividual voting behaviour. This would help toensure that Governing Council decisions
continued to be taken exclusively from a euro

area perspective. The ECB™s approach also
helped to focus public attention on the outcome
of policy deliberations rather than on individualvoting behaviour. Thus it ensured that itsmessages were clear, thereby enhancing the
effectiveness and predictability of its monetary
policy decisions. Finally, the President recalled

that the communication channels chosen by the
ECB, in particular the monthly pressconferences held immediately after theGoverning Council meetings, were more
effective in terms of timeliness than the
publication of minutes.On a more general level, the President
emphasised the fact that the exchanges of views
146ECBAnnualReport
2003with the European Parliament were carefullyassessed and taken into account in the
deliberations of the ECB™s decision-making
bodies. For example, the President mentioned

the publication of the staff economicprojections, which had come about as a result ofa request from the European Parliament. Indeed,

the ECB would continue to seek ways of
enhancing its accountability and transparency
wherever the accomplishment of its policy
objectives allowed.INTERNATIONAL ROLE OF THE EURO AND

EXTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF THE EURO AREA
Another policy area considered in much detail
by the European Parliament in 2003 was the
international role of the euro and the externalrepresentation of the euro area. Several
members of the Committee on Economic and
Monetary Affairs called for more active policies

in order to contribute to a greater use of the
single currency at the international level, for
instance as an invoicing currency for the import
of commodities and energy supplies to the euroarea. Moreover, in its resolution on theinternational role of the euro area and its first
assessment of the introduction of banknotes and
coins, adopted on 3 July 2003, the European

Parliament suggested the appointment of a
single representative for the euro area, whowould be given ﬁbroad powers to speak and acton behalf of euro zone countries in all important

multilateral financial and economic foraﬂ. In the
European Parliament™s view, this role could be
performed by a Vice-President of the European
Commission responsible for Economic andMonetary Affairs.The President recalled that, in the view of theECB, the international role of the euro was
essentially market-driven. Against this
background, the ECB would neither encouragenor discourage non-euro area residents to usethe euro. At the same time, the President also
said that the international role of the single
currency had gradually increased over the past
few years. He shared the European Parliament™s
view that there was a need to improve thestatistical framework for monitoring the use ofthe euro at the international level, an objectiveto which the ECB was actively contributing and
which was also addressed in its legal opinions.
As regards the external representation of theeuro area, the President emphasised that as far
as the euro was concerned, the ECB would
continue to act as the institution expressing the
euro area™s positions internationally, in line
with its responsibilities, as set out in the Treaty.

According to its mandate, the ECB, asrepresented by members of its decision-makingbodies, was the single external voice of the euro
area for all matters related to the single

monetary policy, a role that had also been
endorsed by the Convention on the future of
Europe.ArtistGérard GarousteTitleLa duègne et le pénitent, 1998MaterialOil on canvasFormat195 × 160 cmCHAPTER  6
EXTERNALCOMMUNICATION
150ECBAnnualReport
2003Communication is an integral part of the ECB™s
monetary policy and the performance of its
other tasks. In its communication with the
public, the media and specialised audiences Œ
such as financial market participants Œ the ECBseeks to contribute to the effectiveness,efficiency and credibility of its monetary
policy. A further objective is to give full
account of its actions, as explained in more
detail in Chapter 5. In order to achieve these
objectives, the ECB must be open andtransparent. It must enhance the public™sknowledge and understanding of its tasks and
policies as well as its close collaboration with
the NCBs in the Eurosystem.The ESCB™s communication efforts are targeted
at audiences in the EU with particular focus onthe euro area. It is therefore important for the
ESCB to be able to address a variety of regional
and national audiences in their own languages

and environments. In this context, the
decentralised framework of the ESCB is
instrumental in ensuring the properdissemination of information to the generalpublic and to interested parties. Communication
experts from the ECB and the NCBs regularly
exchange views in order to coordinate their
efforts.In view of the forthcoming enlargement of theEU, the ESCB™s communication efforts have

also been increasingly directed towards
audiences in the acceding countries. The ECB
closely cooperates with the acceding country
central banks, thus broadening the geographicalscope of its external communication.1COMMUNICATION POLICY
151ECBAnnualReport
2003The ECB uses a number of communication toolsin order to meet the above-mentioned
objectives. The most important channels of
communication are the monthly press
conferences held by the President and the Vice-President, which are an essential tool for real-
time communication, the Monthly Bulletin and
the Annual Report. The press conferences and
the Monthly Bulletin are used to present the
ECB™s assessment of economic developments
and explain monetary policy decisions in atransparent and timely manner. The ECBremains one of the most transparent central
banks in the world. The concept of a regular,
real-time and detailed explanation of the ECB™s

policy, assessments and decisions, introduced
in 1999, represents a uniquely open andtransparent approach to central bankcommunication.The Annual Report is also particularlyimportant, as it is one of the statutory

publications of the ECB and is addressed to the
European Parliament, the EU Council, theEuropean Commission and the EuropeanCouncil. It presents the activities of the ESCB
and the monetary policy of both the previous

and the current year, and thus helps to hold the

ECB accountable for its actions.The Monthly Bulletin also contains articlesproviding information on longer-term
developments, general central banking topics
and the analytical tools used by the Eurosystem
for the monetary policy strategy. A list of
articles published in 2003 can be found in the
annex on documents published by the ECB. In
January 2004 the Monthly Bulletin was
published for the first time in its new format.
This new format provided the basis for a review
of the format of other publications and will
eventually lead to the adoption of a newcorporate design for all ECB publications.The President of the ECB makes quarterlyappearances in the form of testimonies before

the European Parliament™s Committee on
Economic and Monetary Affairs and once a yearbefore the European Parliament at its plenary2COMMUNICATION TOOLS
session. Other members of the Executive Boardof the ECB are also invited to appear before the
Committee (see Section 2 of Chapter 5).Speeches and interviews given by membersof the ECB™s decision-making bodies alsoconstitute an important means of
communication.Furthermore, as part of its regular reporting tothe financial sector and the general public, theECB publishes press releases on relevantGoverning Council decisions, on special
studies conducted by the ECB and on other
topics of interest.Dialogue with financial market participants andwith other interested parties is sometimesformalised through public consultation
procedures. In 2003 this instrument was used to
receive their views on issues related to payment
and securities settlement systems, as well as to
the collateral framework of the Eurosystem (see
Chapter 2).In addition, the ECB contributes to the
dissemination of research findings on the
whole range of central bank activities by
publishing Working Papers and Occasional
Papers and organising academic conferences,seminars and workshops. In 2003 the mainevents of this kind included the ﬁSeminar on
Banknote Substratesﬂ, the conference on
ﬁPrivate and public sector challenges in the
payment systemﬂ, organised by the ECB and the
G10 Committee on Payment and Settlement
Systems, the ﬁInsolvency Symposiumﬂ, jointlysponsored with the BIS, the conference on

ﬁPrices, Productivity and Growthﬂ organised in
collaboration with the Banco de España, the
conference on the ﬁEuro Area Business Cycle
Networkﬂ, the ﬁInternational Research Forumon Monetary Policyﬂ in Washington D.C.,and a number of other workshops organised

in collaboration with various academic
associations and euro area NCBs.All documents published by the ECB areavailable on the ECB™s website (www.ecb.int),152ECBAnnualReport
2003which also serves as a contact point for queries
from the public and as a platform for the launch
of public consultations. The use of the website
has grown rapidly over recent years. In
particular, the ﬁStatisticsﬂ, ﬁPress releasesﬂ andﬁJob opportunitiesﬂ sections are frequentlyvisited. In 2003 the ECB began redesigning its
website to facilitate searches for specific
documents and to aid navigation between the
various sections. Another important objective
was to enhance the accessibility of the websitenot only for experts, but also for the general
public and disabled users. The launch of thisnew website is scheduled for the second quarter

of 2004.The ECB also practises openness in a literalsense, by welcoming visitor groups to itspremises in Frankfurt. In 2003 more than 7,000
visitors received first-hand information in the
form of lectures and presentations given by
ECB staff. Students of economics and other
social sciences make up the majority of visitors.3COMMUNICATION ISSUES IN 2003
Among the most important communication
issues in 2003 were:ŒThe evaluation of the monetary policy
strategy. The Governing Council confirmed
the monetary policy strategy and clarified
some of its elements (see Section 1 of
Chapter 1).ŒThe monetary policy stance (see Section 2 of
Chapter 1).ŒThe Governing Council™s view on fiscal
developments in the euro area (seeSection 2 of Chapter 1).ŒMonetary policy operations. Following a
public consultation procedure, a number of
changes to the operational framework wereadopted to take effect in the first quarter of2004 (see Section 1 of Chapter 2).ŒCounterfeiting of euro banknotes. The ECB
continued to regularly inform the public of
developments in the area of euro counterfeits(see Section 3 of Chapter 2).ŒThe ECB™s view on the draft Treaty
establishing a Constitution for Europe (see
Section 1 of Chapter 4).ŒSupervisory issues and financial stability, in
particular the ECB™s participation in the

preparations for the introduction of the New
Basel Capital Accord (ﬁBasel IIﬂ) (see
Chapter 3).ŒThe Governing Council™s policy position on
exchange rate issues relating to the acceding
countries (see Section 1 of Chapter 7).ŒCooperation with the central banks of the
acceding countries and development of
working relationships with the media in
those countries (see Chapter 7).ŒDevelopment of new and improved money
and banking statistics (see Chapter 2).ŒOrganisational matters of the ECB, in
particular the preparations for the ECB™sfuture premises as well as the efforts to
strengthen the functioning of its internal
organisation (see Box 12 and Section 2 of
Chapter 8).153ECBAnnualReport
2003Box 12THE ECB™S MISSION STATEMENT
In August 2003 the Executive Board adopted the ECB™s mission statement. It is regardedas fundamental in both the internal and external communication of the ECB. Its adoption should
be seen as part of the efforts to strengthen the functioning of the ECB™s internal organisation
(see Section 2 of Chapter 8). The mission statement reads as follows:ﬁThe European Central Bank and the national central banks together constitute theEurosystem, the central banking system of the euro area. The main objective of the Eurosystem

is to maintain price stability: safeguarding the value of the euro.We at the European Central Bank are committed to performing all central bank tasks entrustedto us effectively. In so doing, we strive for the highest level of integrity, competence, efficiencyand transparency.ﬂIn four short sentences the mission statement captures the ﬁwhat, why and howﬂ of the ECB.The first sentence recognises the ECB™s vital relationship with the NCBs of the euro area. The
second sentence emphasises the primary objective assigned to the Eurosystem by the Treaty. In
addition to this primary objective, the ECB also carries out a wide range of other tasks andactivities in the pursuit of its mandate, as reflected in the third sentence. The fourth and finalsentence illustrates the values which the staff and management of the ECB regard as important
for the performance of their duties. In a survey, the staff of the ECB were given the opportunity
to influence the choice of values which should be given particular prominence. All staff
members were asked to rank a number of values according to their importance for the work of
the ECB. The results of this survey served as direct input for the formulation of the missionstatement.ArtistÁrpád SzabadosTitleUntitled, 1995MaterialMixed media on canvasFormat120 × 90 cmCHAPTER  7
ENLARGEMENT OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION
156ECBAnnualReport
2003The ten acceding countries Œ the CzechRepublic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania,
Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and
Slovakia Œ and the 15 current EU Member States
signed the Accession Treaty at the informalEuropean Council meeting in Athens on 16 April2003. Two additional countries Œ Bulgaria and
Romania Œ have not yet concluded accession
negotiations but were given the prospect of
joining the EU in 2007.1 The Accession Treaty
sets out the framework and conditions for
enlarging the EU to 25 Member States. All thecurrent and new Member States have ratified the
Treaty. As part of the ratification process, all of
the acceding countries except Cyprus held
public referendums: these nine countries voted
in favour of joining the EU, eight of them by alarge majority.Upon accession, the ten countries will join
EMU with the status of ﬁMember States with
a derogationﬂ (countries which have not yet
adopted the euro) and their central banks will
become part of the ESCB. Once these countriesare deemed to have achieved sustainableconvergence in compliance with the Maastricht
convergence criteria2, they will adopt the euroand their central banks will become part of the
Eurosystem.In 2003 the Eurosystem continued to beinvolved in the accession process in all its areas
of competence. It conducted policy and
technical dialogues to help prepare the central
banks of the acceding countries for integration

into the ESCB and, subsequently, theEurosystem. As regards the policy dialogue, anumber of bilateral contacts were made with the
acceding country central banks to discuss
monetary and exchange rate policies and other
central banking issues. The main aim was to try
to enhance mutual understanding of thechallenges ahead. In addition, the ECBcontinued to be involved in the ﬁEconomic

Dialogueﬂ between the EU and the candidate
countries3 and, in November 2003, it presented
a report on macroeconomic and financial
stability challenges in acceding countries to theEconomic and Financial Committee. Finally, inMarch 2004 a high-level seminar on the
accession process was held in Paris with all

ESCB and accession country central banks.
Among other topics, this seminar covered
monetary and exchange rate policies and thepractical functioning of the Exchange RateMechanism II (ERM II).As far as technical cooperation in 2003 wasconcerned, the Eurosystem intensified its
support for the acceding country central banksto help them prepare for membership of theESCB and the Eurosystem. These activities
focused primarily on statistics, legal issues,

payment systems, monetary policy and
operational issues, but also involved other areas
of central banking, such as financial stabilityand supervision, banknotes, internal audit and
information technology.This chapter gives an overview of recenteconomic, financial and legal developments in
the acceding countries and describes in more
detail some of the accession-related preparatoryactivities carried out by the Eurosystem.1The term ﬁaccession countriesﬂ is used to refer to the ten acceding
countries and Bulgaria and Romania.
2See Article 121 (1) of the Treaty establishing the European
Community.
3The term ﬁcandidate countriesﬂ is used to refer to the 12 accession
countries and Turkey.
157ECBAnnualReport
2003In 2003 the Eurosystem continued to monitoreconomic and financial developments in

the acceding countries. The most relevant
economic issues for the Eurosystem were

inflation developments, monetary and exchangerate policies, economic growth andreal convergence, balance of payments
developments and fiscal policy. The monitoring
of financial markets included recent

developments in both the banking sector and
bond and stock markets.1.1ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
INFLATION
Inflation rates in the acceding countries havefallen remarkably quickly in recent years.Average inflation has now fallen from double-
digit rates at the end of the 1990s to a level close

to that of the euro area. In early 2003 average
inflation was even below the euro area level.

Towards the end of 2003 a pick-up in inflation
rates to slightly above euro area levels wasrecorded. However, progress with disinflation
continued to vary across individual countries.
While some countries recorded very low
inflation and, in a few cases, even temporary
decreases in general price levels, the
disinflation process is not yet complete inothers.The strong general decline in inflation rates waslargely the result of policy frameworks with a
clear focus on fighting inflation. However,
temporary factors also played an important role,in particular cyclical developments, the lagged
effects of strong exchange rate appreciation
against the euro, some easing of energy prices

and a decline in food prices. Alongside

diminishing inflationary pressures, policy
interest rates continued to decline in mostacceding countries in 2003.It will, however, be a real challenge to keepinflation at such low levels. Several factors
could lead to higher inflationary pressures,

which in turn would make the economiesvulnerable to rising inflation expectations and1KEY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICY ISSUES
wage-price spirals. First, cyclical conditionsare beginning to improve in some countries.
Second, temporary factors such as declining
food prices are fading out. Third, temporary
inflationary pressures may also arise fromaccession-related factors, such as pricederegulation, an adjustment of food prices as
the acceding countries adopt the Common
Agricultural Policy, and indirect tax
adjustments required by EU law. Finally, the
catching-up process is likely to affect to someextent the inflation performance in the comingyears as a result of the ﬁBalassa-Samuelson
effectﬂ (see Box 4) and wage pressures, the

impact of which is likely to depend on the
behaviour of nominal exchange rates.MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES
The acceding countries maintain a variety of
monetary policy strategies, reflecting the
heterogeneity among them in nominal, real and
structural terms. Some countries with fixed
exchange rate regimes have an exchange rate
target in place, while other countries operate
inflation-targeting frameworks or mixedstrategies. Two countries peg their currency
unilaterally to the euro within a ±15%
fluctuation band. During 2003 exchange rate
regimes in the acceding countries remained
unchanged, although some refinements weremade to the monetary policy frameworks of
several acceding countries, mostly with a view
to gearing monetary policy more towards future
monetary integration.Monetary and exchange rate strategies inplace made a significant contribution tomacroeconomic stabilisation in the acceding

countries by providing a credible anchor for
inflation expectations, taking into account the
high degree of openness that most of these
countries display. More recently, however,some countries with more flexible exchange ratearrangements have experienced an increase in
nominal exchange rate volatility. These

developments reflected a number of factors,
including changes in investor sentiment
following new macroeconomic and fiscaldevelopments and, in some cases, possibly
158ECBAnnualReport
2003external shocks. High exchange rate volatilitymay complicate monetary policy, have adverse
effects on trade and make it more difficult to
assess equilibrium exchange rates.When the new Member States join the EU, theywill be required to treat their exchange rate
policies as a matter of common interest and to
pursue price stability as the primary objective
of monetary policy. Moreover, they will be
expected to join ERM II at some point in time.Although ERM II can accommodate differentexchange rate regimes, it is not compatible with
free floating (or managed floats without a
mutually agreed central rate), crawling pegs or
pegs against anchors other than the euro. This
means that, in some cases, exchange rate policyframeworks must be brought into line with thefeatures of the mechanism. Several acceding
countries are currently reviewing their
monetary and exchange rate strategies in the
light of future participation in ERM II.
On 18 December 2003 the ECB published apolicy position of the Governing Council onexchange rate issues relating to the acceding
countries. This position aims to help to guide
the process of monetary integration in the
prospective Member States.ECONOMIC GROWTH AND REAL CONVERGENCEIn an environment of slow global growth,
economic growth showed significant resilience
in most acceding countries in 2003, with real

GDP growth projected to be around 3.5% on

average. Output developments were particularlystrong in the Baltic States, and Poland, thelargest acceding country, experienced a solid
economic recovery after two years of low
growth. The key engine of growth in most
acceding countries was strong domestic
demand, fuelled in some countries by fiscal
loosening and strong increases in wages. Inmost acceding countries real export growth
moderated but still displayed robust momentum

considering the weak global environment and
the countries™ strong trade integration with the
euro area. In some countries the contribution ofnet exports to real GDP growth actuallyincreased considerably.At present, the GDP-per-capita gap with thecurrent EU Member States is still large for mostacceding countries. Expressed in purchasingpower parity terms, the acceding countries™
estimated per capita GDP stood on average at
around 49% of the EU average in 2002. In
terms of nominal exchange rates, however, it
reached only 26% on average. Moreover, realconvergence in income levels with the EU is agradual process, with growth differentials
between the acceding countries and the current
EU Member States usually having been in the
range of around 2 percentage points in the past
few years.In the years to come, a key challenge foracceding countries will be to advance real
convergence without putting current
achievements in terms of macroeconomic
stability at risk. For most acceding countries, an
average medium-term growth rate of between
4% and 6% seems within reach, provided thatstructural reforms proceed and stability-
oriented policies are kept in place. Real GDP
growth is expected to rise as a number of
growth-enhancing factors increasingly come
into play, in particular EU accession. Althoughstructural changes and high investment will beconducive to growth, they might also imply
increased output volatility, especially as

investment tends to be more cyclical than
consumption. This factor will therefore
continue to pose challenges for policy-makers.BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS
Real convergence was accompanied by sizeable
current account deficits in most acceding
countries. The average current account deficit
for the ten countries is estimated to have beenaround 3.9% of GDP in 2003, with deficits
being particularly high in some of the smaller
countries. To the extent that the widening of the
current account deficit reflects savings and
investment decisions based on incorrect
perceptions of economic conditions Œ for159ECBAnnualReport
2003example, an overestimation of potential output
growth or an underestimation of the probability
of adverse shocks Œ the sustainability of the
external position may come under pressure in
the medium to longer term and externalvulnerabilities may increase. Up to now,
empirical findings have suggested that most of

the acceding countries do not face major
competitiveness problems. Despite the global
economic slowdown, most countries have
witnessed sustained rates of export growth overthe past few years and, in many cases, haveenlarged their market shares in the EU.Looking ahead, risks to external competitivenesscould arise if countries were to be confronted

with strong pressure to align their wage andprice levels too quickly with those of the EU.Moreover, an inappropriate mix of loose fiscal
policy and tight monetary policy could trigger a
strong, albeit temporary, appreciation of the
currency. Potential risks to current account
sustainability relate also to possible future

changes in the financing pattern. Althoughcapital inflows are generally expected tocontribute to real convergence Œ for example,
through imported technology and management
skills Œ they might imply some destabilising
effects. This would be the case if the scale and

nature of capital flows were to change
substantially from the current pattern where netforeign direct investment (FDI) inflows
essentially cover the current account deficits in

many countries. Following the end of the
privatisation process in most of the acceding
countries, a potential slowdown in FDI inflowsmight pose a challenge within this context,although EU accession may boost greenfield
FDI inflows, i.e. investments in new projects,
which may well compensate for diminishing
privatisation-related FDI. Managing highly
volatile capital flows might become even morechallenging as macroeconomic policies focusincreasingly on preparing the ground for
ERM II and, subsequently, the adoption of the

euro. Furthermore, capital flows largely in
excess of the countries™ absorption capacity
could lead to overheating and more accentuated
output volatility.FISCAL DEVELOPMENTSDespite the recent pick-up in economic activity,fiscal deficits in the acceding countries
remained on average at high levels in 2003: in
the order of 5% of GDP for the ten countries asa whole. At the same time, fiscal performance
continued to vary across countries. In most
acceding countries fiscal deficits are largely of a
structural nature, while the strength of
automatic stabilisers (the automatic reactions of
the budget to economic fluctuations) seems tobe limited. To consolidate the fiscal situation,the acceding countries will need to further
reform their public expenditure and revenue
structures in a sustainable and forward-looking
manner. Although the average debt level is
comparatively low in the acceding countries,running continuously high deficits at a timewhen privatisation receipts are coming to an end
could trigger unfavourable public debt
dynamics, with possible repercussions for

capital flows and exchange rate developments.
Moreover, implicit fiscal liabilities related to
the ageing of societies might pose an additionalchallenge, at least for some of the accedingcountries.Fiscal consolidation is all the more challengingas the acceding countries will be confronted
with expenditure pressures in the coming years.These will arise as a result of the completion ofthe transition process, contributions to the EU
budget, the continuing implementation of the
acquis communautaire and budgetary
requirements related to NATO membership.
Moreover, forthcoming reforms of health andpension systems, as well as public investmentsduring the catching-up process, may have an
important bearing on fiscal accounts in the
acceding countries. At the same time, the
implementation of the EU competition laws may
lead to cuts in selected subsidies, which mayalleviate some of the fiscal strain.Upon EU accession, the new Member Stateswill be subject to the provisions of the Stability
and Growth Pact that apply to all EU Member

States, including the requirements to avoid
excessive fiscal deficits and to aim for160ECBAnnualReport
2003budgetary positions that are close to balance orin surplus over the medium term. A credible

fiscal consolidation path is also needed in view
of the prospective future monetary integration

of acceding countries. While entry into ERM IIis not subject to a set of pre-established criteria,to ensure smooth participation in the
mechanism, major policy adjustments should be
made before countries join and a credible fiscal
consolidation path followed.1.2FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
ACCEDING COUNTRIESBANKING SECTORMost financial markets in the accedingcountries are shallow, reflecting the size of
these economies and the low stock of credit and
deposits. While financial markets in the
acceding countries are largely dominated by the
banking sector, the degree of financial
intermediation (the role of banks as
intermediaries in channelling funds fromdepositors to borrowers) is still rather low.This is not, however, the case in Cyprus and
Malta as these countries did not have to undergo
a transition from a centrally planned economy to
a market economy. In the acceding countries of
central and eastern Europe, the level of financial
intermediation amounts to only one-third of theeuro area average and is lower than in emerging

market economies with comparable income
levels. This is largely because of i) the initial
conditions of the transition process,
ii) the disruptive effects brought about by
banking crises in the early 1990s in thesecountries, iii) the relatively short track record of
domestic enterprises, which translates into
heavy reliance on financing coming from own
sources, and iv) large FDI inflows into some

countries.Nevertheless, despite their limited size, bankingsectors in the acceding countries appear to be

relatively consolidated and sound, with an
overall satisfactory level of capitalisation,
profitability and asset quality. Moreover, thebulk of the banking sector in the acceding
countries is foreign-owned: at the end of 2002,foreign ownership of the banking sector in the
acceding countries (excluding Cyprus and
Malta) amounted to around 70% of registered
capital and 80% of total assets.4 Restructuring
and consolidation in the banking sector throughprivatisation and opening up to foreign
ownership have contributed to the soundness of
the sector by increasing capital and funding and
enhancing technology, governance and risk
management expertise. Nevertheless, someacceding countries still have sizeable non-performing loans, even if these are on a
declining trend and provisions against related
risks appear to be relatively good. Moreover,
the foreign-currency exposure of the enterprise
sector is comparatively high in some countries.If the domestic currency were to weaken
substantially in any of these countries, credit
risks for the banking sector could emerge,
which could in turn have implications for the
conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies.As the catching-up process to higher incomelevels proceeds, the main challenge for policy-makers will be to manage the deepening of
financial intermediation and a dynamic

expansion of financial institutions™ activities

without risking the stability of the sector or the
economy as a whole. For example, it is likelythat domestic enterprises will rely increasinglyon external sources of finance, rather than on
internal funds. Likewise, as their income
prospects and creditworthiness improve,
households may increasingly engage in
intertemporal consumption smoothing. In mostacceding countries financial intermediation has
grown substantially in recent years, albeit
starting from a very low base. In 2002 and 2003

credit growth to private firms and households
was particularly strong in Cyprus, Hungary,
Slovakia and the three Baltic States. Loans tohouseholds grew particularly quickly, outpacingthe overall credit growth rate. Regarding the
distribution of loans among economic activities,4Latvia and Slovenia stand out in this respect, as foreign ownership
of the banking sectors in these countries is considerably below the

average.161ECBAnnualReport
2003mortgage loans are one of the fastest growingcredit segments, having taken off from
negligible levels. In 2002 and early 2003
mortgage lending growth was particularly
strong in Hungary, Latvia and Poland.Although the stock of credit remains low in
most acceding countries, and much of it is
secured by mortgages, the rapid deepening of
financial intermediation and the expansion of

financial sector balance sheets may entail highervolatility in financial performance both inindividual financial institutions and the sector
as a whole. This highlights the need to maintain
a credible and well-run prudential supervision

and regulatory framework in acceding countries
and calls, with regard to the financial sectorstructure, for greater cooperation between homesupervisors and those responsible for
supervising foreign parent banks.BOND AND STOCK MARKETSThe size of bond markets differs across
acceding countries, while government is themain issuer of debt securities in most of thecountries. The stock markets of most acceding
countries are relatively small, particularly in
international terms, and the information and

research coverage of these markets is selective.
Compared with key emerging markets, such asBrazil, Russia or Turkey, external debt markets
are small in all the acceding countries except
Poland. Foreign debt levels differ across

countries and in some countries Œ such as

Estonia and Latvia Œ there is a substantialdifference between net and gross debt levels.An acceleration of debt dynamics was also
observed in some countries.In this context, the bond markets are thesegment that has developed most over the pastfew years, especially in the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland. Macroeconomic

stabilisation Œ in particular, disinflation and
lower interest rates Œ and the prospect of EU
membership have helped to reduce country risk
and attract investors, resulting in a significantfall in long-term yields on domestic bonds in
most of the acceding countries. However, in thesecond half of 2003, increasing concerns about
the course of fiscal policies and overall policy
consistency in some countries led to a reversal
of some of the compression in yield spreadsvis-à-vis the euro area witnessed in previous
periods.Yields of acceding countries™ sovereign bondsdenominated in key currencies remained at low
levels. Yield compression vis-à-vis the euroarea was partly due to the global emergingmarket bond rally, although the prospect of EU

membership, together with the improvement of
sovereign ratings, also appears to have lowered
spreads. More generally, the acceding countries
seem to have disconnected themselves fromdevelopments in other emerging markets. Thebenevolent effects of EU membership should
continue to play a key role in macroeconomic
and structural developments in this respect.
However, conclusions about yield
developments should be drawn with caution
since many acceding countries have ratherilliquid bond markets.Stock markets in the acceding countriesperformed, on average, favourably in 2003 and

broadly in line with stock markets in other
emerging market regions, while outperformingeuro area stock markets. The stock markets inLatvia and Lithuania performed particularly
strongly, with share prices roughly doubling
during 2003. In Estonia and many central
European acceding countries, stock markets
also recorded solid gains. However, in a fewcountries, stock exchanges recorded a lessfavourable performance in 2003: in Cyprus
stock prices fell, and in Malta the gains were
only relatively moderate.162ECBAnnualReport
2003The Eurosystem has a crucial interest inensuring that acceding countries adopt and
implement in time the parts of the 
acquiscommunautaire (the body of EU law) that relate
to its fields of competence. This refers to theTreaty and ESCB Statute provisions on centralbanks, and in particular central bank
independence, as well as EU legislation in the

financial field. In 2003 the Eurosystem worked

closely with the acceding country central banks
(ACCBs) to analyse the level of compliancewith these requirements.As regards central bank independence, the
statutes of the ACCBs were analysed on the
basis of the criteria Œ institutional, personal,
functional and financial independence Œ definedin the legal convergence reports prepared by theEMI and the ECB. The analysis was also
conducted in the light of EMI and ECB opinions

on draft national legislation in their field of
competence and, in particular, on the draft
statutes of the NCBs of the EU Member States.

These opinions have helped the accedingcountries to revise their central bank acts tocomply with the Treaty requirements, thus
laying the foundations for independent
institutions.Central banks and financial institutions mustoperate within a sound legal environment. Theacquis communautaire includes important rules
for the financial sector and central banking
activities. It is crucial for the new Member
States to comply with these rules as soon as
they join the EU (except where the Accession
Treaty provides for transitional arrangements).This is why the Eurosystem™s analysis also
focused on legislation in the financial field,

especially in the areas of freedom of movement
of capital, prohibition on monetary financing
and privileged access, regulation of thefinancial markets, collateral, payment systems,insolvency and banknotes.The analysis gave an overview of the lawsenacted and legislative drafts that had been
presented for adoption to the respective nationalparliaments by 1 October 2003. Movement
2LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS
towards central bank independence has startedin all of the acceding countries and in most of
them it has been completed or is well advanced.
In some cases, where the wording of the
national act was not yet fully in line with that ofthe Statute, the analysis suggested further
adaptation of the national act. The
implementation of the acquis in theEurosystem-relevant areas will take place, at the
latest, when these countries join the EU, subject
to any agreed transitional arrangements.The results of this analysis were presented tothe ACCBs and to the EU Council and the
European Commission. This analysis was not

part of an assessment leading to the adoption of
the convergence reports for the new MemberStates, which the ECB will have to prepareunder Article 122 (2) of the Treaty. Its purpose

was to provide background information on
the preparations for implementing the
Eurosystem™s legal regime in the acceding
countries, which are to join EMU as Member
States with a derogation. In addition, it helpedthe ACCBs to better define their role in theaccession process at the national level. It has
also helped the Commission in further
strengthening the in-depth analysis of issues
relating to central bank independence.
163ECBAnnualReport
2003In 2003 the Eurosystem intensified itsmultilateral and bilateral cooperation with the
acceding countries. Since May 2003 the
governors of the ACCBs have been attending
the meetings of the General Council asobservers and ACCB experts have also
participated as observers in meetings of ESCB
committees and working groups (see Section 1
of Chapter 8). This has made it much easier for
all parties to carry out detailed work on a wide
range of enlargement-related issues. Inaddition, technical consultations were heldregularly and a comprehensive programme of
visits was implemented for senior experts from
ACCBs.In general, preparations for EU enlargement areon track, which should enable the ACCBs tointegrate smoothly into the ESCB as planned.In 2003 the ECB set out an Accession MasterPlan with a view to guiding the planning,

implementation and monitoring of all ECB
activities for ESCB and Eurosystemenlargement. The Master Plan was inspired bythe EMI Master Plan, which had laid down the
organisational and logistical framework
necessary for the ESCB to perform its tasks in
Stage Three of EMU. Regular monitoring
ensures that all relevant issues are dealt with ina timely manner. This will enable the ACCBs  to
integrate smoothly into the ESCB framework
without affecting the overall operational
integrity of the ESCB™s systems. Regular
updates of the Master Plan are communicated
throughout the ESCB and to the ACCBs. Allactivities are being implemented according tothe Plan.3.1CENTRAL BANK OPERATIONS
In the area of central bank operations, the
preparations for accession were directed mainly
towards those central bank tasks that will be

affected by the enlarged ESCB membership
as of May 2004, in particular those concerning
eligible assets and ERM II.3PREPARATIONS FOR ACCESSION
As regards eligible assets for the Eurosystem™s
credit operations, certain assets listed only in

acceding countries will be included in the list of
eligible assets from the day the ACCBs join the

ESCB. Therefore, from May 2004, the ACCBswill start performing the collateral managementfunctions of identification, assessment and
reporting of eligible assets. In preparation, the
ECB organised a workshop for acceding
countries on these functions in November 2003.The ESCB studied in detail the operationalfunctioning of an enlarged ERM II. In February
2004 it held a workshop for acceding countries
on related aspects. This preparatory work,
together with testing to be conducted in spring
2004, should guarantee the smooth operationalfunctioning of ERM II.
In addition to the areas affected by ESCBenlargement, significant steps were also taken
in operational areas related to Eurosystem
enlargement. For example, studies were
launched on the implications of enlargement formonetary policy implementation and themanagement of the ECB™s foreign reserves.3.2PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
In 2003 the ECB defined the modalities for
integrating the acceding countries into
TARGET, essentially offering them the
possibility of connecting to TARGET when
they join the EU. However, most acceding
countries only plan to join the system when they
adopt the euro. Work has also been carried out
on developing a fall-back solution to be used if
the shared platform of TARGET2 (see Section
2.2 of Chapter 2) is not available when the first
acceding countries join the euro area.As a follow-up to the 2002 assessment of thesafety and efficiency of market infrastructures
and the related oversight functions, ACCBs

reported on the progress they had made in 2003
in implementing the ECB™s general and country-

specific recommendations. Substantial progresshas been made and the ACCBs are continuing
164ECBAnnualReport
2003their efforts to complete outstanding issues,where necessary, in close cooperation with
other national parties concerned.The ECB also organised a series of workshopsfor the ACCBs  aimed at providing assistance in
the preparations for accession to the EU and,
subsequently, the euro area. One workshop in
Warsaw focused on the preliminary results of
work carried out jointly by the ESCB and the
Committee of European Securities Regulatorson standards for EU securities clearing andsettlement systems. Another workshop in

Prague addressed the collateral framework of
the Eurosystem with a view to enabling the
ACCBs to adjust to the key features of this
framework as soon as possible. And a thirdworkshop in Ljubljana examined cost, benefitand risk issues relating to central counterparty
clearing. Furthermore, the ﬁRepo conference for
central banks Œ the landscape of the European
marketﬂ held in Rome focused on recent
developments as well as requirements for the
establishment of an efficient and integrated repomarket, particularly in the light of EUenlargement. All these events were organised
by the ECB in cooperation with the local central
bank.Moreover, during 2003 the Eurosystem helpedthe ACCBs to carry out self-assessments oftheir securities clearing and settlement systems
against the ﬁStandards for the use of EU
securities settlement systems in ESCB credit

operationsﬂ. These standards have provided the
necessary framework for the efficient and safeexecution of central bank credit operations (seeSection 4.3 of Chapter 3). The objective of the
assessment was to identify, at an early stage,
issues that needed to be addressed to ensure the
smooth functioning of the Eurosystem credit
operations. A total of 20 securities settlementsystems and one arrangement operated by anACCB were assessed and a list of
recommendations was produced for each
system. These recommendations will have to be
implemented to make the system fully eligible

for use in Eurosystem credit operations.The ECB met for the fifth time with the Centraland Eastern European Central Securities
Depositories and Clearing Houses Association
in October 2003. At this meeting the ECB

provided information on a wide range ofaccession-related issues to representatives ofACCBs, securities regulators, central securities
depositories and clearing houses.The ECB and the European Payments Council,which was established by the European CreditSector Associations and the major banks,
organised a special workshop for selected
ACCB representatives and their respective
banking communities. The purpose of this
workshop, which was also attended by the
European Commission, was to share importantinformation on how to successfully integratethe acceding countries into the Single Euro
Payments Area.3.3BANKNOTES
In 2003 the ECB supported the ACCBs in
establishing the infrastructure for handling euro
counterfeits. The infrastructure must be in place
when the acceding countries join the EU.
Moreover, in view of the long lead time for
preparing the cash changeover in thesecountries after adoption of the euro, the ECBorganised workshops for the ACCBs
addressing, in particular, the arrangements for
the issuance and handling of euro banknotes
and the procurement of banknote launch
requirements in the acceding countries.3.4STATISTICS
At a high-level meeting in Copenhagen in October

2002, the ministers for economics and financefrom the EU Member States and the candidatecountries invited the European Commission
(Eurostat) and the ECB to provide an Action Plan

for economic, monetary and financial statistics for
candidate countries. This Action Plan was
prepared and subsequently endorsed at a high-165ECBAnnualReport
2003level meeting with the candidate countries in May2003. The participants noted that the completeness
and timeliness of statistical information had been
steadily improving. However, the Action Plan also
revealed that, unless major efforts were made inthe run-up to accession, the acceding countrieswould not be in a position to meet all requirements,
i.e. data timeliness, level of detail and other quality

aspects.The Action Plan puts emphasis on the supply ofstatistics required for the purpose of assessingconvergence and on structural statistics. It is
made up of two main parts: the first part refers
to statistics which fall under the responsibility
of the European Commission (Eurostat),
namely annual national accounts, governmentdeficit and debt, the HICP, structural indicatorsand short-term statistics. Most action points
aim at improving i) the availability of statistics
and conceptual compliance by May 2004 and
ii) compliance with EU statistical regulations in
general. The second part of the Action Plan
covers issues under the responsibility of theECB in the fields of balance of payments(b.o.p.) and international investment position
(i.i.p.) statistics, money, banking and financial
market statistics and quarterly financial
accounts. These statistics are mainly collected
via the ACCBs. The action points in this partaim at ensuring compliance with therequirements of the ESCB.
Both parts of the Action Plan are subject toregular review. A high-level progress report

drafted by the European Commission (Eurostat)and the ECB is to be published in mid-2004. Inaddition, the Executive Board of the ECB has
set up a biannual progress review for the

indicators for which the ECB has primary or
shared responsibility.3.5IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND APPLICATIONS
Significant progress was made in 2003 in
preparing the IT infrastructure and applications

for ESCB enlargement. Three major elementsare being enhanced to provide the necessarynetwork and communications infrastructure.The core network is the physical connectionbetween the ESCB central banks for data andvoice communication. A new core network is
being set up to connect all members of the
enlarged ESCB. The detailed technical design
work for this network began in July 2003.
In October 2003 the ECB started to implement aproject to extend the ESCB-wide datacommunications infrastructure (the ﬁESCB-
Netﬂ) to the ACCBs. The ESCB-Net is a data
communications platform which hosts the
majority of ESCB-wide applications. These
include the applications required for supportingmonetary policy, carrying out ECB foreignreserve operations, exchanging statistical and
non-statistical data, and monitoring currency
information.The ﬁESCB Teleconference Systemﬂ is alsobeing extended to the ACCBs. Newteleconference equipment is being installed toallow all current and new ESCB members to
participate in teleconferences via the same
secure infrastructure.Preparations were also made for the significantenhancements to IT applications that arenecessary for the enlargement of the ESCB and,
subsequently, the Eurosystem. IT applications
for the exchange of statistical data were
updated. The necessary changes to the
application for combating euro counterfeitingare ongoing and will be completed before theACCBs join the operational framework of the
ESCB.ArtistKoen VermeuleTitleUntitled (detail), 2002MaterialOil on canvasFormat210 × 210 cmINSTITUTIONALFRAMEWORK,

CHAPTER 8168ECBAnnualReport
20031.1THE EUROSYSTEM AND THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKS
1DECISION-MAKING BODIES AND CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE OF THE ECB
The European System of Central Banks (ESCB)is composed of the European Central Bank(ECB) and the national central banks (NCBs) of
all EU Member States (currently 15, 25 as of
1 May 2004), i.e. it includes the NCBs of the
Member States which have not yet adopted the
euro. In order to enhance transparency andfacilitate understanding of the structure ofcentral banking in the euro area, the Governing
Council has adopted the term ﬁEurosystemﬂ,

which comprises the ECB and the NCBs of the

Member States which have adopted the euro. As
long as there are Member States which have notyet adopted the euro, it will be necessary tomake a distinction between the Eurosystem and
the ESCB.The ECB has legal personality under publicinternational law. It was established as the coreof the Eurosystem and the ESCB and ensuresthat their respective tasks are carried out eitherthrough its own activities or via the NCBs.Each of the NCBs has legal personalityaccording to the national law of its respective

country. The euro area NCBs, which form an

integral part of the Eurosystem, carry out the
tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem inaccordance with the rules established by the
ECB™s decision-making bodies. The NCBs also
contribute to the work of the ESCB through
their participation in the various ESCB
committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter).They may perform non-Eurosystem functionson their own responsibility, unless the
Governing Council finds that such functions
interfere with the objectives and tasks of the
Eurosystem.EURO

169ECBAnnualReport
2003The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed bythe decision-making bodies of the ECB: the
Governing Council and the Executive Board.
Decision-making within the Eurosystem and the
ESCB is centralised. However, in taking itsdecisions on the way in which the above tasksshould be carried out, the ECB is committed to
the principle of decentralisation in accordance
with the Statute of the ESCB. The General
Council is constituted as a third decision-
making body of the ECB, if and for as long asthere are Member States which have not yetadopted the euro. The functioning of the
decision-making bodies is governed by the
Treaty, the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant
Rules of Procedure.11.2THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
The Governing Council comprises all the
members of the Executive Board and the
governors of the NCBs of the Member States
which have adopted the euro. According to theTreaty, its main responsibilities are:Œto adopt the guidelines and take the decisions
necessary to ensure the performance of thetasks entrusted to the Eurosystem; andŒto formulate the monetary policy of the
euro area, including, as appropriate,
decisions relating to intermediate monetary
objectives, key interest rates and the supply
of reserves in the Eurosystem, and to
establish the necessary guidelines for theirimplementation.The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice amonth at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt am
Main, Germany. Specifically at its first meeting
in the month it, inter alia, conducts an in-depthassessment of monetary and economicdevelopments and takes related decisions, while
the second meeting usually focuses on issues
related to other tasks and responsibilities of the
ECB and the Eurosystem. In 2003 two meetings
were held outside Frankfurt: one was hosted bythe Banca d™Italia in Rome and the other by the
Banco de Portugal in Lisbon.When taking decisions on monetary policy andon other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem,the members of the Governing Council do notact as national representatives, but in a fully
independent personal capacity. This is reflected
by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ
applied within the Governing Council.In December 2002 the Governing Councildecided unanimously on the contents of its
proposal on the future adjustment of its voting
modalities, which will become necessary in the
wake of future expansions of the euro area in an
enlarged EU. The proposal was made inaccordance with the ECB ﬁenabling clauseﬂcontained in the Treaty of Nice. Following
the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice on
1 February 2003, the ECB formally adopted a
recommendation on the adjustment of the voting
modalities in the Governing Council.The ECB recommendation was submitted tothe EU Council in February 2003. On the basis
of the recommendation, and after taking
into account the opinions of the European
Commission and the European Parliament, the
EU Council, meeting in the composition ofHeads of State or Government, unanimouslyadopted a Decision to amend Article 10.2 of the
Statute of the ESCB (voting modalities in the
Governing Council) on 21 March 2003. In
order to enter into force, this Decision needs to
have been ratified by all Member States, whichis not yet the case.1See Decision ECB/2004/2 of 19 February 2004 adopting the
Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 80,18.3.2004, p. 33; Rules of Procedure of the General Council of
the ECB, OJ L 75, 20.3.1999, p. 36 and L 156, 23.6.1999, p. 52;
Decision  ECB/1999/7 of 12 October 1999 concerning the Rules
of Procedure of the Executive Board of the European Central
Bank, OJ L 314, 8.12.1999, p. 34. These rules are also available
on the ECB™s website.
170ECBAnnualReport
2003According to this Decision, all members of theGoverning Council will continue to attend
meetings and participate in the deliberations.
However, the number of NCB governors
holding a voting right at any one time will notexceed 15. The 15 voting rights will rotateamong the governors according to pre-
established rules. The six members of the

Executive Board will each maintain a permanent
voting right. In order to ensure that at any
particular time the governors with a voting rightare from countries which, taken together, are
representative of the euro area economy as
a whole, governors will hold a voting right
with different frequencies. However, this
differentiation between governors will apply
exclusively to the prior determination of thefrequency with which each governor has avoting right. For all governors having a voting

right at any point in time, the ﬁone member, one
voteﬂ principle will apply.Governors will be allocated to different groups,according to a ranking of the weight of theeconomies of their countries within the euroarea, derived from an indicator which in

addition to gross domestic product also reflects
the size of their financial markets. When the
number of euro area countries exceeds 15, there
will be two such groups. When there are 22 euro
area countries, the system will be based on threegroups. The governors within each group will
have a voting right for equal periods of time.

The new voting system is designed to be

capable of accommodating any sequencing
of euro area enlargement up to 27 countries,i.e. the current EU Member States and the
12 accession countries listed in the Declaration

on the enlargement of the European Union
annexed to the Treaty of Nice. The rotation

system will allow the Governing Council to
maintain its capacity for timely and efficientdecision-making while at the same timeretaining the principle of ad personam
participation of the members of the Governing

Council and the ﬁone member, one voteﬂ
principle.171ECBAnnualReport

General Council met four times, in line with itsregular schedule. With a view to enhancing
cooperation with the acceding country central
banks (ACCBs) in preparation for enlargement
of the ESCB, the General Council decided in
September 2002 to invite the governors of theACCBs to attend, as from the date of thesigning of the Accession Treaty, the meetings

The ESCB committees have continued to playan important role in the performance of thetasks of the Eurosystem/ESCB. At the requestof both the Governing Council and the
Executive Board, the ESCB committees have
provided expertise in their fields of competence

and have facilitated the decision-making
process. Membership of the ESCB committeesis usually restricted to staff of the Eurosystemcentral banks. However, the NCBs of the

Member States which have not yet adopted the
euro take part in the meetings of an ESCB
committee whenever it deals with matters that
fall within the field of competence of theGeneral Council. Where appropriate, othercompetent bodies may also be invited, such as
national supervisory authorities in the case of
the Banking Supervision Committee. Since the
signing of the Accession Treaty in April 2003,
and in line with the decision to invite ACCBgovernors to participate in the meetings of theGeneral Council, experts from the ACCBs areinvited to attend the meetings of ESCBcommittees in an observer capacity wheneverthey deal with matters that fall within the field
of competence of the General Council. At
present there are 12 ESCB committees, all of
which were established under Article 9 of the
Rules of Procedure of the ECB.The Budget Committee, which was established
under Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure of
the ECB, assists the Governing Council in
matters related to the ECB™s budget.176ECBAnnualReport
20031.6CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In addition to the decision-making bodies, thecorporate governance of the ECB also
encompasses a number of external and internalcontrol layers.EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS
The Statute of the ESCB provides for twolayers, namely the external auditor, which
audits the annual accounts of the ECB (Article27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB), and theEuropean Court of Auditors, which examines
the operational efficiency of the management of
the ECB (Article 27.2).In August 2002 the Governing Council decidedthat, in order to give the fullest public assuranceas to the independence of the ECB™s external
auditor, the principle of audit firm rotation
should be applied. This decision was
implemented as part of the procedure for the
appointment of the ECB™s external auditor
(under Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB).The new external auditor commenced its dutiesin September 2003.2The annual report of the European Court of
Auditors, together with the ECB™s reply, is

INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS
In 2003 the ECB™s internal audit continued to
perform audit missions under the responsibility

of the Executive Board. Its mandate is definedin the ECB Audit Charter.3 The internal audit
assesses and evaluates, on an ad hoc basis, the
adequacy and effectiveness of the ECB™s
system of internal control and the quality of the

ECB™s performance in carrying out assigned
responsibilities. As endorsed by the Executive
Board, the internal audit adheres to theInternational Standards for the Professional

Practice of Internal Auditing established by the

Institute of Internal Auditors.The Internal Auditors Committee, an ESCBcommittee established under a mandate from theGoverning Council, is composed of the heads ofinternal audit at the ECB and the NCBs. It is
responsible for ensuring the coordination of
audit coverage for joint projects and joint
operational systems at the ESCB level.The internal control structure of the ECB isbased on a functional approach, whereby each

organisational unit (division, directorate or
directorate general) is responsible for its own
internal control and efficiency. In performingthis task, organisational units implement a setof operational control procedures within their
area of responsibility. For example a set of
rules and procedures Œ known as a Chinese wall
Œ are in place to prevent inside information, for
instance originating from the areas responsiblefor monetary policy implementation, fromreaching the areas responsible for the
management of the ECB™s foreign reserves and
own funds portfolio. In addition to these
controls, the Directorate Planning and

Controlling, the Risk Management Division and
the Directorate Internal Audit advise and make
proposals to the business areas and to theExecutive Board on specific control issues
affecting the organisation as a whole.The members of the Governing Council adhereto a Code of Conduct, which reflects theirresponsibility to safeguard the integrity andreputation of the Eurosystem and to maintain
the effectiveness of its operations.4 The
Governing Council has also appointed an
adviser to provide guidance to its members on
some aspects of professional conduct. The Codeof Conduct for the members of the GoverningCouncil is comparable with the Code of
Conduct of the European Central Bank, which
gives guidance to, and sets benchmarks for, the
staff of the ECB and the members of the2Following a tender procedure, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-
Gesellschaft AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was
appointed as the ECB™s new external auditor with a five-year

mandate.3The ECB Audit Charter is published on the ECB™s website to
foster the transparency of audit arrangements in place at the
ECB.4See the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing
Council, OJ C 123, 24.5.2002, p. 9 and the ECB™s website.

2003Executive Board, all of whom are expected tomaintain high standards of professional ethics

in the performance of their duties.5The ECB has detailed rules preventing the abuseof sensitive financial market information
(ﬁinsider trading rulesﬂ). The staff of the ECB

and the members of the Executive Board are
thereby prohibited from taking advantage,
whether directly or indirectly, of inside

information to which they have access whenconducting private financial activities at theirown risk and for their own account, or at the
risk and for the account of a third party.6 An
Ethics Adviser appointed by the Executive
Board ensures a consistent interpretation of
these rules.ANTI-FRAUD MEASURESIn 1999 the European Parliament and the EU
Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1073/
1999 concerning investigations carried out by

the European Anti-Fraud Office7 (ﬁOLAF
Regulationﬂ) in order to step up the fightagainst fraud, corruption and any other illegalactivity detrimental to the Communities™

financial interests. It provides inter alia for the
internal investigation of suspected fraud by
OLAF within the Community institutions,

bodies, offices and agencies.While fully recognising and accepting the needfor strong measures to prevent fraud, the
Governing Council was of the view that the
ECB™s independent position and statutory tasks
precluded the application of the OLAFRegulation to the ECB. Instead, it adopted theseparate Decision ECB/1999/5 of 7 October1999 on fraud prevention, which provided for
the establishment of a comprehensive anti-fraud
scheme under the ultimate control of an
independent Anti-Fraud Committee. Thecreation of this independent committeeenhanced the original layers of control within
the ECB. In 2003 the Anti-Fraud Committee
held one meeting and was regularly informed by
the Directorate Internal Audit of all issues
related to the performance of its tasks.The European Commission, supported by theKingdom of the Netherlands, the European
Parliament and the EU Council, subsequently
challenged this stance (Case C-11/00). On
10 July 2003 the European Court of Justiceruled on the submissions of these parties andannulled Decision ECB/1999/5.The Court ruling unambiguously placed theECB ﬁwithin the framework of the
Communityﬂ. At the same time it stated that thelegislator had wanted to ensure that the ECBcould independently carry out the tasks
conferred on it. However, the Court ruled that
this independence does not have the
consequence of separating the ECB entirely
from the Community and exempting it from
every rule of Community law. This is in linewith the approach taken by the ECB. The

application of the OLAF Regulation should not
impair the independent performance of the
ECB™s tasks.The ECB is now in the process of finalising anew Decision that will take full account of thejudgement delivered by the Court.5See the Code of Conduct of the European Central Bank in
accordance with Article 11.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the
European Central Bank, OJ C 76, 8.3.2001, p. 12 and the ECB™s

20032.1HUMAN RESOURCES
STAFFING
The total number of budgeted staff positions for2003 was 1,271.5 full-time equivalent (FTE)positions. At the end of 2003 the number ofstaff employed by the ECB was 1,217
(1,213.5 FTE positions), compared with 1,109
(1,105.5 FTE positions) at the end of 2002. The
average number of staff employed by the ECB
in 2003 was 1,160, compared with 1,080 in
2002. In 2003 151 new staff were recruited and
41 members of staff left the service of the ECB.
The number of FTE positions for 2004 has been
set at 1,362.5, representing a 7.1% increase

over 2003.From 1 January 2003 all vacant positions wereopened up to acceding country nationals. The

ECB successfully launched recruitment
campaigns aimed specifically at recruiting such
nationals as translators, lawyer-linguists and
legal counsels. 39 staff members from acceding

countries are currently employed on contractsfor more than one year.In 2003 90 experts from NCBs came to the ECBfor short periods of approximately four months
on average. Of these experts, 48 came from
ACCBs. These short-term assignments provedparticularly useful for both the ECB and theACCBs in the preparations for the enlargement
of the EU.In 2003 the ECB offered 113 short-termcontracts (including extensions) to replace staffon maternity, parental and unpaid leave,compared with 60 in 2002.
The ECB provided traineeships to 166 studentsand graduates, mainly with an economics
background, for an average duration of threeto four months. 135 such traineeships wereoffered in 2002. In 2003 48 of the trainees were
nationals of an acceding country.Under the Research Visitors Programme, whichfocuses on specific high-level research projectsin the field of monetary policy, 24 research2ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
visitors were welcomed in 2003 compared with20 in 2002 (see Section 5 of Chapter 2).The Graduate Research Programme, which isaimed at highly talented research students at anadvanced stage of their doctoral studies,
attracted 12 participants in 2003, the same

number as participated in 2002.INTERNAL MOBILITYIn 2003 93 staff members changed jobspermanently after successfully applying forinternal vacancies for permanent positions. In
addition, the ECB encouraged temporary
internal mobility. 12 staff members took on

another job for a limited period in order to gain
work experience or to address an urgent buttemporary business need, before returning totheir previous position.EXTERNAL MOBILITYAt the beginning of the year the External Work
Experience Scheme was introduced to support
staff development. In the framework of this
scheme, staff may be seconded to NCBs andother relevant international and European

institutions. Three staff members participated in
this scheme during 2003 for a period of two to
five months.CHILDCARE FACILITIES AND THE EUROPEAN

SCHOOLThe ECB childcare facilities have been enlarged
by a third permanent facility offering
approximately 90 additional places for the

children of ECB staff. This brings to 221 thetotal number of places available for childrenaged three months and above.The secondary school of the European SchoolFrankfurt opened in September 2003 with five
grades. Like the primary and pre-primarylevels, the secondary school has four languagesections: English, French, German and Italian.179ECBAnnualReport
20032.2MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN THE
FUNCTIONING OF THE INTERNAL

ORGANISATION
Since 1998 the ECB™s priorities have been theestablishment of its functions, the formulationand implementation of the single monetary
policy and the introduction of the euro. At the
same time, however, the ECB has steadily
grown, and the number of staff members
substantially increased, creating a need toreinforce the functioning of its internalorganisation. Following the successful

completion of the euro cash changeover, the
Executive Board therefore decided to improve

the organisational set-up, further develop the
management structure and processes andreinforce human resources policies, inparticular with regard to recruitment and career

development.ECB IN MOTIONIn the context of the increased focus on
strengthening the internal organisation of theECB, the Executive Board also decided, in early2003, to launch staff surveys on the issues of
corporate principles, internal communication

and organisational performance. On the basis of
the survey results, the Executive Board decided
to embark on a process aimed at improvingthe functioning of the ECB called ﬁECB inMotionﬂ. The process, which involved staff
to the largest extent possible, addressed the
issues raised in the surveys. Four project

teams were established, under the guidance

of a project office and the Executive Board.The teams developed proposals regarding
management, professional development,
internal communication and measures aimed at
reducing bureaucracy. In October 2003 the
Executive Board endorsed the bulk of the
proposals made by the four project teams andset up a programme office that will oversee the
further development and implementation of the
measures endorsed. Most of the approved ECB
in Motion measures should be ready for
implementation by July 2004.ESTABLISHMENT OF A MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
The Executive Board also reviewed its own
functioning and its role in the management of
the ECB. It decided to establish a Management
Committee which will advise and assist theExecutive Board with regard to the managementof the ECB, its strategic planning and the annual
budget process. This will enable the Executive
Board to increase the attention it devotes to the

preparation and discussion of strategic issues,
with regard to both the tasks and policies andthe internal structure and functions of the ECB.The Management Committee, which reports to
the Executive Board, is chaired by a member of
the Executive Board and composed of members
of senior management. The committee began its
work in October 2003.
RESTRUCTURING OF THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL

INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Since 1994 significant work has been devoted
to establishing the core infrastructures and
applications required for the start of Stage
Three of EMU and the introduction of the euro.During this time, the IT departments of both theEMI and the ECB have successfully met the
deadlines set, and the information systems of
the ECB and the ESCB have proven to be sound

and robust.At the beginning of 2002 the ECB decided to
review the way in which information systems
services are delivered at the ECB. The aim was

to assess the existing organisation, structure

and effectiveness of the ECB™s information
systems delivery and to give guidance on itsfuture direction.In July 2003 the Executive Board approved fourmain recommendations which had been made in
cooperation with an external consultant chosen
to assist in the review. These recommendationswill result in the strategic redirection ofinformation systems delivery and include the
following measures:ŒThe project portfolio management, focusing
on prioritisation and the allocation of IT andfinancial resources, will be strengthened.
180ECBAnnualReport
2003ŒThe Directorate General Information
Systems (DG-IS) has been reorganised in

order to focus on enhancing project
management and delivery capabilities.

Accordingly, the staff in DG-IS willconcentrate more on in-house projectmanagement and delivery skills to cope with
the growing IT project demand from the
business areas of the ECB and from the
ESCB.ŒThe ECB will focus more on the
establishment and enforcement of common

IT architecture standards in order to reduce
the complexity and maintenance costs of the

IT landscape.ŒFinally, the ECB will reassess the sourcing
options for the IT operational, support and
infrastructure activities.The new organisational structure is being
established around three areas: an IT Projects
Directorate, an IT Operations and SupportDivision and an IT Management FunctionsDivision. The implementation of the other
recommendations has started and should be
completed by the end of 2004.RESTRUCTURING OF THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL
STATISTICS
During 2003 a restructuring of the Directorate
General Statistics (DG-S) took place. Since the
establishment of the ECB, the output and staff
of DG-S had more than doubled, but the
organisational structure had remainedessentially the same. The medium-term strategy
for statistics, as adopted by the ECB in early
2003 (see Section 4 of Chapter 2), could only
be implemented following an organisational
review of the Directorate General. This review
started in February 2003 and was carried out bya team including an NCB expert. Based on
the team™s proposals, the Executive Board
approved a new organisational structure,

effective as of 1 February 2004.One of the main features of the reorganisation isthe strengthening of the user-orientation ofDG-S, e.g. through a centralised userinformation service. Furthermore, the new
set-up serves to increase efficiency and
effectiveness in the development of new
statistics and statistical standards by combiningpreviously scattered positions allocated to thesetasks in a separate new division.2.3NEW ECB PREMISES
Being currently located in several different

rented buildings, the ECB decided to have new
premises built. For this purpose it acquired a
site, the Grossmarkthalle area, from the City of
Frankfurt. Within the framework of the ﬁNew
ECB Premisesﬂ project, a worldwide call wasissued for candidates to participate in thearchitectural design competition, with a
deadline for applications of 20 January 2003.

The ECB received applications from more than
300 architects from 31 nations and five
continents. In April a Pre-Selection Committee,

consisting of five ECB experts supportedby five architects, chose 80 candidates, 70ﬁestablishedﬂ and 10 ﬁemerging youngﬂ
architects. All 80 candidates were invited to a
question and answer session in Frankfurt am
Main, which included a site visit to the
Grossmarkthalle area. Many of the questionsraised by the architects related to the technical
specifications of the old Grossmarkthalle
building, which dates from 1928, and to the
requirements stemming from its status as a
listed building. The architects were then asked
to anonymously submit a design proposal for
the first phase by 7 July.The competition was judged by an internationaljury chaired by the ECB™s Vice-President and
consisting of 12 members: three members from
the ECB, three members from NCBs, the fiveexternal, internationally renowned architectswho had participated in the Pre-Selection
Committee and one representative of the City
of Frankfurt am Main. On 28 and 29 August
the jury shortlisted 12 candidates to be admitted
to the second phase of the competition. The
ECB asked the 12 candidates to present a more181ECBAnnualReport
2003detailed architectural design concept by12 December. The jury chose the three prize-
winning designs on 13 February 2004.8 All
design proposals submitted in both phases of
the competition were subsequently displayed tothe public in a three-week exhibition at theDeutsches Architektur Museum in Frankfurt am
Main.The ECB may ask the prize-winning candidatesto revise their design concepts in line with therecommendations of the jury and adjustedfunctional and technical requirements set by

the ECB. After examining and evaluating the
final design concepts, the ECB will award the
contract for the ECB™s new premises to the

candidate who in the opinion of the ECB bestmeets the selection criteria. The planningprocess will start thereafter and construction is
scheduled to begin in 2006.8A press release and pictures are available on the ECB™s website.
182ECBAnnualReport
2003In 2003 two meetings of the ESCB SocialDialogue were held, in which employee
representatives from all the central banks of the
ESCB and European trade union federations
met with the ECB to discuss developments inthe ESCB which have an impact on the situationof NCB employees. Employee representatives
of the ten ACCBs were invited to attend as

observers.As in previous years, the main items discussed
were developments in banknotes, paymentsystems, and financial stability and
supervision.In the field of banknotes, the focus was on thearrangements for banknote printing in the longterm (see Section 3 of Chapter 2). Employee
representatives argued that banknotes were a
public good and highlighted that the quality and

security of the banknotes were crucial for
public confidence. They also felt that the job
security of printing works™ staff should be
safeguarded for various reasons, in particular inacknowledgement of the major efforts involvedin having the euro banknotes printed in time for
the cash changeover. Therefore, central banks
should continue to be involved in all processes

related to banknotes, in particular their printing.Regarding payment systems, the focus was onthe progress in the preparations for TARGET2
(see Section 2 of Chapter 2). The ECB informed
the participants in the ESCB Social Dialogue on

an ongoing basis of the progress made. The
employee representatives commented on thepossible solutions and expressed a preferencefor a decentralised solution along the lines of
the current system.As regards financial stability and supervision,the ECB provided the participants withinformation on the reform of EU arrangementsfor financial regulation, supervision and
stability, the process of implementation of the
Lamfalussy framework in the banking sector,
the process of revision by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision of the capital adequacyrequirements for banks (the New Basel Capital3ESCB SOCIAL DIALOGUE
Accord), and reforms of national supervisorystructures (see Section 2 of Chapter 3).
Employee representatives reiterated their
preference for tasks relating to financial
stability and supervision to be allocated to thecentral banks.The ESCB Social Dialogue meetings alsoprovided opportunities to discuss other more
general issues such as the development of
common training programmes and a corporateculture for the ESCB, the preparations of theECB for the enlargement of the ESCB in 2004

and the restructuring in some NCBs following
the establishment of the Eurosystem. With
regard to the latter issue, the factors underlying
such reorganisations were discussed and theemployee representatives expressed their
concern about maintaining employment levels in
the NCBs.The views and concerns expressed by the tradeunion representatives were conveyed to the

Governing Council and the General Council.At the meetings of the ESCB Social Dialoguethe ECB emphasised that the Governing
Council, in taking its decisions, applies the
principles of efficiency, effectiveness, security,
high quality and high standards of service.Furthermore, the impact of its decisions onemployment and social conditions is taken into
account.In October 2003 the ECB launched an ESCBSocial Dialogue Newsletter in order toenhance both the flow of information to the
participants between meetings and the common
understanding of the topics covered. Finally,

participants stressed the need to strengthen
the corporate culture within the ESCB. To this
end common training programmes are beingorganised.183ECBAnnualReport

2003FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
The financial statements of the European
Central Bank (ECB) have been designed to

present fairly the financial position of the ECBand the results of its operations. They have beendrawn up in accordance with the following
accounting policies2, which the GoverningCouncil of the ECB considers to be appropriate
to the nature of central bank activity.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been
applied: economic reality and transparency,
prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet
events, materiality, the accruals principle, going
concern and consistency and comparability.BASIS OF ACCOUNTINGThe accounts have been prepared on a historical
cost basis, modified to include market valuation
of marketable securities, gold and all other on-

balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currency.Transactions in financial assets and liabilities
are reflected in the accounts on the basis of the

date on which they are settled.GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND
LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency are converted into euro at the exchange
rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income

and expenses are converted at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time of the transaction. The

revaluation of foreign exchange assets andliabilities is performed on a currency-by-
currency basis, including on-balance-sheet and
off-balance-sheet instruments.Revaluation to the market price for assets andliabilities denominated in foreign currency istreated separately from the exchange raterevaluation.Gold is valued at the market price prevailing atthe year-end. No distinction is made between
the price and currency revaluation differencesfor gold. Instead, a single gold valuation isaccounted for on the basis of the price in europer fine ounce of gold, which is derived from
the exchange rate of the euro against the US
dollar on 31 December 2003.SECURITIESAll marketable debt securities and similar assets
are valued at the mid-market prices prevailing at
the balance sheet date on a security-by-security
basis. For the year ending 31 December 2003,

mid-market prices on 30 December 2003 wereused. Non-marketable securities are valued atcost.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the
period in which they are earned or incurred.Realised gains and losses arising from the saleof foreign exchange, gold and securities are
taken to the profit and loss account. Such
realised gains and losses are calculated by
reference to the average cost of the respective
asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income,but are transferred directly to a revaluation
account.Unrealised losses are taken to the profit and lossaccount if they exceed previous revaluationgains registered in the correspondingrevaluation account. Unrealised losses in any
one security, currency or in gold are not netted
against unrealised gains in other securities,
currencies or gold. In the event of an unrealised
loss on any item at the year-end, the average
cost of that item is reduced to the year-endexchange rate and/or market price.1The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in a
Decision of the Governing Council of the ECB of 5 December
2002 (ECB/2002/11), OJ L 58, 3.3.2003, pp. 38-59.
2These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 of
the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach to
the rules governing the accounting and financial reporting of
Eurosystem operations.ACCOUNTING POLICIES1188ECBAnnualReport
2003Premiums or discounts arising on purchasedsecurities are calculated and presented as part of
interest income and are amortised over the
remaining life of the assets.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSUnder a repurchase agreement, securities are
sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to
repurchase them at an agreed price on a set

future date. These agreements to repurchase are

reflected on the liability side of the balancesheet and also lead to an interest expense in the
profit and loss account. Securities sold under
such an agreement remain on the balance sheet
of the ECB.Under a reverse repurchase agreement securitiesare bought for cash with a simultaneousagreement to sell them back to the counterparty

at an agreed price on a set future date. These
agreements to sell are recorded on the asset side
of the balance sheet, but are not included in the
ECB™s security holding and give rise to interest
income in the profit and loss account.Reverse transactions (including securitylending transactions) conducted under an

automated security lending programme are
recorded on the balance sheet only where

collateral is provided to the ECB in the form of
cash over the maturity of the transaction. In2003 the ECB did not receive any collateral in

the form of cash over the maturity of such
transactions.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange
forward transactions, forward legs of foreign
exchange swaps and other currency instruments
involving an exchange of one currency for
another at a future date, are included in the net

foreign currency position for the purpose of
calculating foreign exchange gains and losses.Interest rate instruments are revalued on an
item-by-item basis. Outstanding interest rate

futures positions are recorded in off-balance-
sheet accounts. Since 2003 daily changes in the
variation margin have been recorded in theprofit and loss account.POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTS
Assets and liabilities are adjusted for events thatoccur between the annual balance sheet date and
the date on which the Governing Council of the
ECB approves the financial statements if suchevents materially affect the condition of assetsand liabilities at the balance sheet date.
INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM
BALANCESIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-bordertransactions that occur between two EU centralbanks. These transactions are processed primarily
via TARGET Œ the Trans-European Automated
Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer
system (see Chapter 2)  Œ and give rise to bilateral

balances in accounts held between those EUcentral banks connected to TARGET. Thesebilateral balances are then assigned to the ECB on
a daily basis, leaving each NCB with a single net

bilateral position vis-à-vis the ECB only. This
position in the books of the ECB represents the net
claim or liability of each NCB against the rest of

the ESCB.Intra-ESCB balances of the euro area NCBswith the ECB (except for the capital of the ECB

and positions resulting from the transfer of
foreign reserve assets to the ECB) are described

as intra-Eurosystem claims or liabilities and arepresented in the balance sheet of the ECB as asingle net asset or liability position.Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from theallocation of euro banknotes within the
Eurosystem are included as a single net asset underﬁClaims related to the allocation of euro banknoteswithin the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁBanknotes in
circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).Intra-ESCB balances of the non-euro area
NCBs (Danmarks Nationalbank, SverigesRiksbank and the Bank of England) with theECB are disclosed under ﬁLiabilities to non-
euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ.
TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets, with the exception of land, arevalued at cost less depreciation. Land is valued189ECBAnnualReport
2003at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-
line basis, beginning in the quarter after
acquisition and continuing over the expected
economic lifetime of the asset, namely:The depreciation period for capitalised buildingand refurbishment expenditure relating to theECB™s existing premises has been reduced inorder to ensure that these assets are completely
written off by the end of 2008, by which time the
ECB is expected to have moved to its final

location.THE ECB™S RETIREMENT PLANThe ECB operates a defined contribution
pension scheme. The assets of the plan, which

exist solely for the purpose of providing
benefits for members of the plan and their
dependants, are included in the other assets of
the ECB and are identified separately in thenotes on the balance sheet. Valuation gains andlosses arising on the assets of the pension fund

are recognised as income and expenditure of the

retirement plan in the year in which they arise.
The benefits payable from the core benefit
account, resulting from the contributions of theECB, have minimum guarantees underpinningthe defined contribution benefits.BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION
The ECB and the 12 euro area NCBs, which
together comprise the Eurosystem, issue eurobanknotes.3 The total value of euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem central
banks on the last working day of each month in
accordance with the banknote allocation key.
4 The
ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of the total
value of euro banknotes in circulation, which isdisclosed under the balance sheet liability itemﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ. The ECB™s share ofthe total euro banknote issue is backed by claims
on the NCBs. These claims, which bear interest5,are disclosed under the sub-item ﬁIntra-
Eurosystem claims: claims related to the allocation
of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ(see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem
balancesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).
Interest income on these claims is included within
the item ﬁNet interest incomeﬂ. The Governing

Council has decided that this income shall bedistributed separately to the NCBs in the form ofan interim distribution after the end of each

quarter6. It will be distributed in full unless theECB™s net profit for the year is less than its
income earned on euro banknotes in circulation,

and subject to any decision by the GoverningCouncil to reduce this income in respect of costsincurred by the ECB in connection with the issue
and handling of euro banknotes.OTHER ISSUESTaking account of the ECB™s role as a central
bank, the Executive Board of the ECB considersthat the publication of a cash flow statement
would not provide the readers of the financial
statements with any additional relevant
information.In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute ofthe ESCB, and on the basis of a recommendation
of the Governing Council of the ECB, the
Council of the European Union has approved
the appointment of KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-
Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschafts-
prüfungsgesellschaft as the external auditors ofthe ECB for a five-year period starting from thefinancial year 2003.3ECB Decision of 6 December 2001 on the issue of euro banknotes

The ECB holds 24.7 million ounces of fine gold(2002: 24.7 million ounces). No transactions in
gold took place in 2003. The balance sheetmovement compared with 2002 is due to theyear-end revaluation of these holdings (see

ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and
liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting policies).2CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO AREA
RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCYReceivables from the IMFThis asset represents the ECB™s holdings ofSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) as at31 December 2003. It arises as the result of a
two-way SDR buying and selling arrangement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange sales

or purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf of
the ECB, within minimum and maximum
holding levels. The SDR is defined in terms of abasket of currencies. Its value is determined as
the weighted sum of exchange rates of the four

major currencies (euro, Japanese yen, pound
sterling and US dollar). For accounting
purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreigncurrency (see ﬁGold and foreign currency assetsand liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting

policies).Balances with banks and security investments,external loans and other external assetsClaims on euro area residents denominated in
foreign currencyThese claims consist of balances with banks,
loans denominated in foreign currency and

investments in securities, denominated in US

The reduction in these positions in 2003 isprimarily due to the year-end revaluation of the

ECB™s US dollar denominated assets. The
depreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis the euro
has resulted in a significant decline in their euro

equivalent value (see ﬁGold and foreign

2003(a)Securities denominated in euro and reverse
repurchase agreements in euro constitute the
investment of the ECB™s own funds (see
also note 12).(b)The investment portfolios relating to the
ECB pension fund are valued at €91.7million (2002: €61.9 million). The assets
held represent the investments of

accumulated pension contributions by the
ECB and the staff of the ECB as at31 December 2003, and are managed byan external fund manager. The regular
contributions of the ECB and members of
the plan have been invested on a monthly
basis. The assets of the plan are not fungible
with other financial assets of the ECB, andnet income thereon does not constituteincome of the ECB, but is reinvested in the

funds concerned, pending payment of
benefits. The external fund manager values

the assets of the pension fund using year-
end market prices.(c)The ECB holds 3,000 shares in the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) which are
included at the acquisition cost of 
€38.5million.Accruals and prepaid expensesIn 2002 this position included accrued interest
receivable of €727 million on the ECB™s claimsrelated to the allocation of euro banknotes
within the Eurosystem for the whole year. As
from 2003, this interest is received after the end
of each quarter. Consequently this position nowincludes only the final quarterly accrued
interest due to the ECB of €165 million (seeﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on
accounting policies).The remainder of this balance consistsprincipally of accrued interest on securities andother financial assets.SundryIn 2002 this position included the accrued
interim distribution of the ECB™s incomederived from banknotes of €606 million. In2003, all such income was retained by the ECB(see note 20 in the ﬁNotes on the Profit and

12OTHER LIABILITIES
This item consists mainly of interest due to theNCBs in respect of their claims relating to the
foreign reserves transferred (see note 11). The
ECB™s obligations in respect of the pension
fund, including a provision based on the
actuary™s report, amount to €100.6 million(2002: €72.4 million). Also included withinthis balance are other accruals and outstanding

repurchase transactions of €64 million,conducted in connection with the management
of the ECB™s own funds (see note 6).
13PROVISIONS
In 2000, a general provision against the ECB™s
large exposure to exchange rate and interest rate
risk was made. The size and continuingrequirement for this provision was reviewed
annually, based on the ECB™s assessment of its

future exposure to exchange rate and interest
rate risk. Given the significant depreciation of
the US dollar vis-à-vis the euro in 2003, this
provision was used in full to cover unrealisedlosses expensed at year-end arising principallyfrom the revaluation of the ECB™s holding of

US dollar denominated assets (see ﬁIncome
recognitionﬂ in the notes on accounting policies
and note 22 in the ﬁNotes on the Profit and Loss
Accountﬂ)7.This position also includes provisions relatingto pensions and expenditure on goods and
services, together with an appropriate provision
against the contractual obligation of the ECB to
restore its current premises to their original
condition when they are vacated and the ECBmoves to its final site.14REVALUATION ACCOUNTS

CHANGES TO THE ECB™S CAPITAL KEY
BackgroundUnder Article 29.3 of the Statute of the ESCB,the key of NCBs for subscription of the ECB™s
capital must be adjusted every five years. The
first such adjustment following the establishment
of the ECB was made on 1 January 2004. On
1 May 2004 a second change of the ECB™s capital
key will follow as a result of the accession of ten
new Member States. Based on the CouncilDecision of 15 July 2003 on the statistical data tobe used for the determination of the key for
subscription of the capital of the European
Central Bank, the capital keys of NCBs were

adjusted on 1 January 2004 as follows:From 1 JanuaryFrom 1 January

IMPACT OF CHANGES
Capital of the ECBDue to the overall reduction of 1.3559% in theweighting of the euro area NCBs (with fully
paid-up subscriptions) in the ECB™s capital, and
the increase in that of the non-euro area NCBs
(who only paid up 5% of their subscription), the
ECB™s capital decreased by a total of €64million on 1 January 2004.NCBs™ claims equivalent to the foreign reserveassets transferred to the ECBGiven the decrease in the weighting in the ECB
capital key of the euro area NCBs (which

transferred foreign reserve assets to the ECBaccording to their prevailing subscribed sharesin the ECB™s capital), the initial claim of
€40,497 million equivalent to this transfer wasalso adjusted accordingly. This resulted in a

reduction of €678 million, which was repaid tothe euro area NCBs.Changes as at 1 May 2004When the new countries join the European
Union and their respective NCBs become part

of the ESCB, the subscribed capital of the ECB

and the limit on the amount of foreign reserveassets that may be transferred to the ECB willbe increased automatically.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS17AUTOMATIC SECURITY LENDING PROGRAMME
As part of the management of the ECB™s own
funds, the ECB has concluded an automatic
security lending programme agreement whereby

an appointed agent enters into security lendingtransactions on behalf of the ECB with anumber of counterparties, designated by theECB as eligible counterparties. Under this
agreement, reverse transactions conducted
under repurchase and reverse repurchase

This income is distributed to the NCBs as

outlined in ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in thenotes on accounting policies.Based on the ECB™s estimated financial resultfor the year ending 31 December 2003, the
Governing Council decided in December 2003:(a)to recall the three interim quarterly
distributions already paid to the NCBs
during the year amounting to €533 million in
total;(b)to withhold the final quarterly interim
distribution of €165 million.Remuneration of NCBs™ claims in respect offoreign reserves transferredRemuneration paid to euro area NCBs on their
claims on the ECB in respect of the foreign
reserve assets transferred under Article 30.1 of
the Statute of the ESCB is disclosed under this
item.Other interest income and Other interest
expensesThese positions include interest income andexpenses on balances arising from TARGET
and in respect of other assets and liabilities
denominated in euro.Net interest income has decreased compared
with 2002, primarily due to the further declinein both US dollar and euro interest rates during
the year.21REALISED GAINS/LOSSES ARISING FROM

200322WRITE-DOWNS ON FINANCIAL ASSETS AND
POSITIONSThis expense is primarily due to the write-down
of the average acquisition cost of the ECB™s US
dollar holding to its end-of-year exchange rate
as at 31 December 2003, following thedepreciation of this currency against the euroover the year. It was partially covered by the
release of the remaining general provision
against foreign exchange and interest rate risks
(see ﬁIncome recognitionﬂ in the notes on
accounting policies and note 2 in the ﬁNotes on
the Balance Sheetﬂ respectively).23NET (EXPENSE)/INCOME FROM FEES AND
COMMISSIONS24OTHER
 INCOMEOther miscellaneous income during the yeararose principally from the transfer of unused
administrative provisions to the profit and lossaccount.25STAFF COSTS
Salaries and allowances of €108.2 million(2002: €92.6 million) and employer™scontributions to the ECB™s pension fund and to
health and accident insurance are included
under this heading. The emoluments of the
Executive Board of the ECB amounted to a total
of €2.0 million (2002: €2.0 million). No
pensions were paid to former members of the
Executive Board or their dependants during the
year. Transitional payments were made to

departing members of the Executive Board.
Salaries and allowances, including the
emoluments of holders of senior management
positions, are modelled in essence on, and arecomparable with, the remuneration scheme ofthe European Communities.At the end of 2003 the ECB employed 1,213staff, of whom 84 held managerial positions.

pensionable service ceased, on that date.

2003The pension cost relating to the plan is assessed
in accordance with the advice of a qualified
actuary. The total pension cost to the ECB
including a provision for disability and post-
retirement benefits was €21.7 million (2002:€27.4 million). This cost includes a provisionfor pensions to members of the Executive Board

of €1.9 million (2002: €2.1 million) and anysupplementary contributions. The required rate
of future service contributions by the ECB is
16.5% of pensionable earnings of all staff.
27ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
These cover all other current expenses relating
to rental and maintenance of premises, goodsand equipment of a non-capital nature,professional fees and other services and
supplies, together with staff-related expenses
including recruitment, relocation, installation,
training and resettlement.28DEPRECIATION OF TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
The rise in the level of the depreciation charges
in 2003 reflects for the first time the effect of
reducing the depreciation period for capital
expenditure on buildings and refurbishment
(see ﬁTreatment of fixed assetsﬂ in the notes onaccounting policies).29BANKNOTE PRODUCTION SERVICES
In 2003 this expense related to cross-border

transportation costs of euro banknotes between
NCBs to meet unexpected fluctuations in
demand. These costs are borne centrally by the

ECB. The figure for 2002 related to the
expensing of a contingency stock of eurobanknotes acquired for the Eurosystem in 2001.199ECBAnnualReport
2003This note is not part of the financial statements of
the ECB for the year 2003. It is published in the
Annual Report for information purposes only.INCOME RELATED TO THE ECB™S BANKNOTE ISSUE
Following a decision by the Governing Council
of the ECB, the amount of €698 million wasretained by the ECB to ensure that the total
profit distribution for the year did not exceedthe ECB™s net profit for the year. This amount isall of the income relating to the ECB™s share of
total euro banknotes in circulation for 2003.COVERAGE OF ECB LOSSESUnder Article 33.2 of the Statute of the ESCB,
in the event of a loss incurred by the ECB, the
shortfall  may be offset against the general

reserve fund of the ECB and, if necessary,
following a decision by the Governing Council,
against the monetary income of the relevantfinancial year in proportion and up to theamounts allocated to the national central banks
in accordance with Article 32.5 of the Statute.
8At its meeting on 18 March 2004, the
Governing Council of the ECB decided to coverthe loss for the year ending 31 December 2003as follows:NOTE ON THE ALLOCATION OF LOSSES

MEASURES OF THE EUROSYSTEM
11The chronology of monetary policy measures of the Eurosystem
taken in 1999 to 2001 can be found on pages 176 to 180 of the

ECB™s Annual Report 1999, on pages 205 to 208 of the ECB™s

Annual Report 2000 and on pages 219 to 220 of the ECB™s Annual

Report 2001 respectively.
9 JANUARY 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides thatthe minimum bid rate on the main refinancing
operations and the interest rates on the marginallending facility and the deposit facility willremain unchanged at 2.75%, 3.75% and 1.75%
respectively.23 JANUARY 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides to
implement the following two measures to
improve the operational framework for
monetary policy:First, the timing of the reserve maintenance
period will be changed so that it will always
start on the settlement day of the main
refinancing operation (MRO) following the
Governing Council meeting at which the

monthly assessment of the monetary policy

stance is pre-scheduled. Furthermore, as a rule,the implementation of changes to the standingfacility rates will be aligned with the start of the
new reserve maintenance period.Second, the maturity of the MROs will beshortened from two weeks to one week.These measures are scheduled to come intoeffect during the first quarter of 2004.Further to the press release of 10 July 2002, theGoverning Council also decides to maintain at15 billion the allotment amount for each of thelonger-term refinancing operations to be
conducted in the year 2003. This amount takes
into consideration the expected liquidity needs
of the euro area banking system in 2003 and

reflects the desire of the Eurosystem to continueto provide the bulk of liquidity through its mainrefinancing operations.6 FEBRUARY 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides that
the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing
operations and the interest rates on the marginallending facility and the deposit facility willremain unchanged at 2.75%, 3.75% and 1.75%
respectively.6 MARCH 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides to
lower the minimum bid rate on the main

refinancing operations by 0.25 percentage point
to 2.50%, starting from the operation to be

settled on 12 March 2003. It also decides tolower the interest rates on both the marginallending facility and the deposit facility by 0.25
percentage point, to 3.50% and 1.50%
respectively, both with effect from 7 March
2003.3 APRIL 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides that
the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing
operations and the interest rates on the marginal
lending facility and the deposit facility willremain unchanged at 2.50%, 3.50% and 1.50%respectively.8 MAY 2003
The Governing Council of the ECB decides that
the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing
operations and the interest rates on the marginal
lending facility and the deposit facility will
remain unchanged at 2.50%, 3.50% and 1.50%
respectively.218ECBAnnualReport
2003It also announces the results of itsevaluation of the ECB™s monetary policy
strategy. This strategy, which was
announced on 13 October 1998, consists of
three main elements: a quantitativedefinition of price stability, a prominentrole for money in the assessment of risks to
price stability, and a broadly based
assessment of the outlook for price
developments.The Governing Council confirms the definitionof price stability formulated in October 1998,
namely that ﬁprice stability is defined as a year-
on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of

below 2%. Price stability is to be maintained
over the medium termﬂ. At the same time, theGoverning Council agrees that in the pursuit of
price stability it will aim to maintain inflation
rates close to 2% over the medium term.The Governing Council confirms that itsmonetary policy decisions will continue to be
based on a comprehensive analysis of the risksto price stability. At the same time, the

Governing Council decides to clarify in its
communication the respective roles played by
economic and monetary analysis in the process
of coming to the Council™s overall assessmentof risks to price stability.To underscore the longer-term nature of the
reference value for monetary growth as a
benchmark for the assessment of monetary
developments, the Governing Council alsodecides that it will no longer conduct a reviewof the reference value on an annual basis.

However, it will continue to assess the
underlying conditions and assumptions.5 JUNE 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides to
lower the minimum bid rate on the main

refinancing operations by 0.50 percentage point
to 2.0%, starting from the operation to besettled on 9 June 2003. It also decides to lowerthe interest rates on both the marginal lendingfacility and the deposit facility by 0.50
percentage point, to 3.0% and 1.0%

respectively, both with effect from 6 June 2003.10 JULY, 31 JULY, 4 SEPTEMBER,

2 OCTOBER, 6 NOVEMBER, 4 DECEMBER 2003
AND 8 JANUARY 2004The Governing Council of the ECB decides thatthe minimum bid rate on the main refinancingoperations and the interest rates on the marginal
lending facility and the deposit facility will
remain unchanged at 2.0%, 3.0% and 1.0%

respectively.12 JANUARY 2004The Governing Council of the ECB decides to
increase the allotment amount for each of the
longer-term refinancing operations to be
conducted in the year 2004 from 15 billion to25 billion. This increased amount takes intoconsideration the higher liquidity needs of the
euro area banking system anticipated for the
year 2004. The Eurosystem will, however,
continue to provide the bulk of liquidity
through its main refinancing operations. TheGoverning Council may decide to adjust theallotment amount again at the beginning of
2005.5 FEBRUARY, 4 MARCH 2004
The Governing Council of the ECB decides that
the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing
operations and the interest rates on the marginal
lending facility and the deposit facility will
remain unchanged at 2.0%, 3.0% and 1.0%
respectively.219ECBAnnualReport
2003Asset allocation: the process of distributing investment funds over different asset classes to achieve goalssuch as optimising portfolio risk/return characteristics.Acceding countries: see Accession countries
Accession countries: there are currently 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and in the Mediterraneanwhich have been recognised by the European Council as candidates for accession to the European Union
(EU). Ten countries will join the EU on 1 May 2004: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania,
Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia. These ten countries are termed the acceding countries. Twoother countries, Bulgaria and Romania, have already entered into accession negotiations and have been given
the prospect of entry into the EU in 2007. Turkey is also an official candidate for accession and is included inthe Economic Dialogue with the EU, but accession negotiations have not yet begun. The term accessioncountries refers to the 12 countries with which negotiations for EU membership have been completed or are still
ongoing.Acquis communautaire: the body of Community legislation by which all EU Member States are bound.
Countries joining the EU must have implemented the existing acquis communautaire by the time of accession.
Balance of payments (b.o.p.): a statistical statement that summarises, for a specific time period, theeconomic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The transactions considered are those involving
goods, services and income; those involving financial claims on, and liabilities to, the rest of the world; and
those (such as debt forgiveness) that are classified as transfers. The concepts and definitions used in the euroarea balance of payments generally conform to the 5th edition of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual, to the
related Guideline ECB/2003/7 of 2 May 2003 and to Eurostat™s documentation.Basel Capital Accord:
 a regulatory framework setting out minimum capital requirements to ensure that
banks are able to cover their risks. This framework was adopted in 1988 by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision on which the central banks and other banking supervisory authorities from the G10 countries, Spain

and Luxembourg are represented. The Accord has evolved into a global standard and is now under review in order
to adapt it to developments that have occurred in the financial sector since it was initially introduced (ﬁNewBasel Capital Accordﬂ or ﬁBasel IIﬂ).Benchmark portfolio: in relation to investments, a reference portfolio or index constructed on the basis of
the objectives for the liquidity and risk of, as well as the return on, the investments. The benchmark portfolio

serves as a basis for comparison of the performance of the actual portfolio.
Bond market: the market on which medium and long-term 
debt securities, i.e. debt securities with anoriginal maturity of more than one year, are issued and traded.Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs): the 
Treaty obliges the Member States to regard their
economic policies as a matter of common concern and to coordinate them within the EU Council
. The BEPGsconstitute the main instrument of this coordination. They contain recommendations to policy-makers onmacroeconomic and structural policies and provide a yardstick for ex post assessment in the context ofmultilateral surveillance within the EU Council. The EU Council, acting on a recommendation from the
European Commission, formulates a draft of the BEPGs and reports its findings to the 
EuropeanCouncil. The EU Council then adopts a recommendation on the BEPGs based on the European Council™s
conclusions.GLOSSARY
220ECBAnnualReport
2003Central counterparty: an entity which interposes itself as the buyer to every seller and as the seller to every
buyer of a specified set of contracts.Central securities depository (CSD): an entity which holds and administers securities and enables
securities transactions to be processed by book entry. Securities can be held in a physical but immobilised form
or in a dematerialised (book-entry only) form. In addition to the safekeeping and administration of securities, a
CSD may incorporate clearing and settlement functions.Central government: the government as defined in the European System of Accounts 1995(ESA 95)
 but excluding state and local governments (see also 
general government). It includes alladministrative departments of the (central) state and other central agencies whose competence normally extendsover the entire economic domain except for the administration of social security funds.Collateral: assets pledged (e.g. by 
credit institutions with central banks) as a guarantee for the repayment
of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. to central banks by credit institutions) under 
repurchase agreements.Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR): this committee, which was established by
the European Commission in June 2001 in the light of the recommendation of the Report of the Committee
of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets, is composed of representatives from the national
authorities regulating the securities markets. As the Level 3 body of the revised European regulatory approach,
it advises the European Commission on securities policy issues and contributes to ensuring a more consistent

implementation of Community legislation in the Member States. It also improves coordination among European
securities regulators.Consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector: obtained by netting out inter-MFI positions (mainly
loans granted by one MFI to another) on the aggregated MFI balance sheet.Corporate governance: procedures and processes according to which an organisation is directed andcontrolled. The corporate governance structure specifies the distribution of rights and responsibilities among the
different participants in the organisation Œ such as the board, managers, shareholders and other stakeholders Œand lays down the rules and procedures for decision-making. In so doing, it also provides the structure withinwhich the organisation™s operational targets are set, and specifies the means of attaining those targets and of
monitoring performance.Counterparty: the opposite party in a financial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with a central bank).
Credit institution: an institution covered by the definition in Article 1 (1) of Directive 2000/12/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business
of credit institutions, as amended by Directive 2000/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
18 September 2000. Thus, a credit institution is: (i) an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or
other repayable funds from the public and to grant credit for its own account; or (ii) an undertaking or any other
legal person, other than those under (i), which issues means of payment in the form of electronic money.Credit risk: the risk that a 
counterparty will not settle an obligation in full, either when due or at any time
thereafter.221ECBAnnualReport
2003Debt (financial accounts): includes loans, debt securities issued, and pension fund reserves of non-
financial corporations, valued at market value at the end of the period. In the quarterly financial accounts, debt
does not include loans granted by the non-financial sector (e.g. inter-company loans) or by banks outside the
euro area, whereas these components are included in the annual financial accounts.
Debt ratio (general government):
 general government debt is defined as total gross debt at nominal value
outstanding at the end of the year and consolidated between and within the sectors of general government. The
government debt-to-GDP ratio is defined as the ratio of general government debt to gross domestic product at
current market prices. It is the subject of one of the fiscal criteria laid down in Article 104 (2) of the Treaty to
define the existence of an excessive deficit.Debt securities: represent a promise on the part of the issuer (i.e. the borrower) to make one or more
payment(s) to the holder (the lender) on a specified future date or dates. They usually carry a specific rate of
interest (the coupon) and/or are sold at a discount to the amount that will be repaid at maturity. Debt securities
issued with an original maturity of more than one year are classified as long-term.Deficit ratio (general government): the general government deficit is defined as net borrowing and
corresponds to the difference between government revenue and government expenditure. The deficit ratio isdefined as the ratio of the general government deficit to gross domestic product at current market prices. It is the
subject of one of the fiscal criteria laid down in Article 104 (2) of the 
Treaty establishing the European
Community to define the existence of an excessive deficit. It is also referred to as the budget deficit ratio or the

fiscal deficit ratio.Deposit facility: a 
standing facility of the 
Eurosystem which counterparties may use to make overnight
deposits, remunerated at a pre-specified interest rate, at an NCB (see also key ECB interest rates).Direct investment: cross-border investment that reflects the objective of obtaining a lasting interest in an
enterprise resident in another economy (in practice assumed for ownership equivalent to at least 10% of the
voting rights). The direct investment account records net acquisitions of assets abroad by euro area residents
(as ﬁdirect investment abroadﬂ) and net acquisitions of euro area assets by non-residents (as ﬁdirect investmentin the euro areaﬂ). Direct investment includes equity capital, reinvested earnings and other capital associatedwith inter-company operations.ECOFIN Council: see 
EU Council.Economic analysis: one pillar of the 
ECB™s framework for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the risksto price stability, which forms the basis for the Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions. Theeconomic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of current economic and financial developments and the
implied short to medium-term risks to price stability from the perspective of the interplay between supply and
demand in goods, services and factor markets at those horizons. In this respect, due attention is paid to the need
to identify the nature of shocks affecting the economy, their effects on cost and pricing behaviour and the short
to medium-term prospects for their propagation in the economy (see also monetary analysis).Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a consultative Community body which contributes to the
preparation of the work of the EU Council. It was set up at the start of Stage Three of Economic andMonetary Union (EMU). The Member States, the European Commission and the ECB
 each appoint
no more than two members of the Committee. Article 114 (2) of the Treaty contains a list of the tasks of theEFC, which include reviewing the economic and financial situation of the Member States and of the Community,and budgetary surveillance.222ECBAnnualReport
2003Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the 
Treaty describes the process of achieving EMU in the
European Union (EU) in three stages. Stage One of EMU started in July 1990 and ended on 31 December 1993;
it was mainly characterised by the dismantling of all internal barriers to the free movement of capital within the
EU. Stage Two of EMU began on 1 January 1994. It provided for, inter alia, the establishment of the
European Monetary Institute (EMI), the prohibition of financing of the public sector by the centralbanks, the prohibition of privileged access to financial institutions by the public sector and the avoidance ofexcessive government deficits. Stage Three started on 1 January 1999 with the transfer of monetary competence
to the ECB and the introduction of the 
euro. The cash changeover on 1 January 2002 completed the processsetting up EMU.Economic Policy Committee (EPC): a consultative Community body which contributes to the preparation
of the work of the EU Council. It works in close cooperation with the Economic and FinancialCommittee (EFC) and focuses mainly on structural policies aimed at improving the growth potential and
employment in the Community. The Committee, which is provided for in Article 272 of the Treaty, was setup by a Council Decision in 1974. Each Member State appoints two members of the Committee, as does the
European Commission and the ECB
.Effective exchange rates (EERs, nominal/real): nominal euro EERs are weighted averages of bilateral
euro exchange rates against the currencies of the 
euro area™s main trading partners. The ECB publishes
nominal EER indices for the euro against the currencies of a narrow and a broad group of trading partners. The
weights used reflect the share of each partner country in euro area trade. Real EERs are nominal EERs deflated
by a weighted average of foreign, relative to domestic, prices or costs. They are, thus, measures of price and cost
competitiveness.Electronic money (e-money): an electronic store of monetary value on a technical device that may be
widely used as a prepaid bearer instrument for making payments to undertakings other than the issuer, without
necessarily involving bank accounts in the transactions.EONIA (euro overnight index average): a measure of the 
interest rate prevailing in the euro
interbank overnight market, based on transactions.Equity market: the market in which claims to a share in the ownership of a business are issued and traded.
A major difference between equity and debt is that the former does not have to be repaid by the issuer.Equity securities: represent ownership of a stake in a corporation. They comprise shares traded on stock
exchanges (quoted shares), unquoted shares and other forms of equity. Equities usually produce income in theform of dividends.ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II): the exchange rate arrangement which provides the framework for
exchange rate policy cooperation between the euro area countries and the EU Member States not participating
in Stage Three of EMU.EU Council (Council of Ministers): an institution of the European Community made up of
representatives of the governments of the Member States, normally the ministers responsible for the matters
under consideration (therefore often referred to as the Council of Ministers). The EU Council meeting in the
composition of the ministers of economy and finance is often referred to as the ECOFIN Council. Inaddition, for decisions of particular importance, the EU Council meets in the composition of the Heads of State

or Government. This should not be confused with the European Council, which also brings together the Heads223ECBAnnualReport
2003of State or Government but which provides the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and definesthe general political guidelines.EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate): the rate at which a prime bank is willing to lend funds in
euro to another prime bank, computed daily for interbank deposits with different maturities of up to 12 months.
Euro: the name of the European single currency adopted by the 
European Council at its meeting in Madrid
on 15 and 16 December 1995.Euro area: the area encompassing those Member States in which the 
euro has been adopted as the single
currency in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy is conducted under theresponsibility of the Governing Council of the 
ECB. The euro area currently comprises Belgium, Germany,Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland.
Eurogroup: informal grouping bringing together those members of the 
ECOFIN Council who represent
the euro area countries. It meets on a regular basis (usually prior to meetings of the ECOFIN Council) todiscuss issues connected with the euro area countries™ shared responsibilities for the single currency. TheEuropean Commission and, when appropriate, the 
ECB are invited to take part in these meetings.
European Central Bank (ECB): the ECB lies at the centre of the 
European System of CentralBanks (ESCB) and the 
Eurosystem and has legal personality under Community law. It ensures that the
tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem and the ESCB are implemented either through its own activities or throughthose of the NCBs, pursuant to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central
Bank. The ECB is governed by the Governing Council and the
