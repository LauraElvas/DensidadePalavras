 109x304978 European Economy Overview  EU and euro area 
 The weak economic performance ob
served in the euro area and EU 
economies at the end of 2002 continued throughout the first half of this year. 
Consequently, for a third consecutive year, growth is likely to disappoint: the 

average growth rate is expected to be 
a mere 0.4% in 2003 in the euro area 
(0.8% in the EU). However, with
 accommodative macroeconomic policy 
conditions, continued disinflation, supportive financial conditions, progress 
in structural reforms, and a reduction in geopolitical uncertainty, the 
confidence of economic agen
ts is returning and the international environment 
is improving.  
 In this context, the momentum for recovery is expected to pick up in the 

second half of 2003 and to gather 
pace throughout 2004. A rebound to 
average growth rates of 1.8% for the euro area and 2% for the EU is 

projected next year, approaching 2.5% in 2005. This is underpinned by a 

recovery in consumer expenditure, supported by growing external demand, 
and a consequent recovery in investment. Despite this projected recovery, the 
protracted period of sluggish growth has taken its toll on the performance of 

the labour market and employment gr
owth is expected to be sluggish, 
registering only 0.3% in 2004 and a somewhat better 0.8% in 2005.  

 Incipient global recovery  After the contraction in world trade in
 2001 and the weak growth in 2002, the 
future now looks brighter. The sluggish growth in foreign trade projected for 
this year is deceptive, since it is affected by the po
or performance in the first 
half of the year. It should accelerate 
from around 4.4% in 2003 to between 7 
and 8% in 2004-2005. 

 
World GDP growth is projected at 3.3% in 2003, up from last year™s 2.8%. It 
should increase to a robust 4.1% in
 2004 and 2005. This acceleration is 
supported by a number of factors, 
including accommodative macro-economic 
policies and supportive
 financial
 conditions Œ partially linked to further 
disinflation Œ and a return of confidence, that originates from reduced 
geopolitical tensions and strength in asset markets. 
 Looking ahead to 2004, the base for world growth is widening, with strong 

and rising contributions coming from Asia (particularly China), the US, 
Australia, and the acceding co
untries. In the US, helped by monetary and 
fiscal policy stimulus and solid underlying productivity growth, the recovery 
is expected to continue with growth at about 2.8% in 2003, rising to 3.8% in 
2004.  This will bring GDP growth above potential. Nonetheless, in 2004, 
both the general government deficit and the current account deficit are 

expected to widen to 5.5% and 5.6% of GDP, respectively. 
  1304978 European EconomyEconomic Forecasts, Autumn 2003 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 The economic outlook for growth in Asia remains buoyant with growth at 

6.7% in 2004-2005. Prospects for Japan have also improved with a sharp 

upward adjustment of growth to 2.6% in 2003, although deflation is set to 

continue, albeit at a lower pace, and 
the general government deficit is 
expected to exceed 7% th
roughout the forecast period.  After stagnation in 
2002, Latin America is expected to recover moderately, benefiting from 

currency depreciation, a pick-up in
 the world economy and the gradual 
resolution of the financial crises, which hit several countries in the region. 

Growth is expected to regain momentum around the end of 2003 in Canada.  

Also in the countries preparing fo
r accession on 1 Ma
y 2004, continued 
strong growth is expected throughou
t the forecast period, supported by 
domestic demand and structural change.   

 Diminishing oil prices 
and recovering stock 

markets  
 The oil price assumptions suggest a gradual decline from a high of USD 31 
(Brent crude) in mid-October to yield 
an average of USD 28.3 per barrel for 
the year as a whole.  A further easing 
is assumed over the next two years, to 
USD 25.6 per barrel in 2004 and USD 24.1 per barrel in 2005.   

 
Since mid-June, equity prices have stabilised and government yields have 

bounced back fairly sharply, though the latter remain low by historical 

standards. With lower risk premia
 and accommodative interest rates, 
financing conditions in the global economy have improved compared to last 

year. This should help to promote recovery Œ particularly by facilitating a de-

leveraging of the corporate sector in 
both the United States and the European Union.

The euro area and EU 

economies failed to 

gather momentum in 

the first half of 2003 
 Following its poor performance in 2002, the euro area economy stagnated in 
the first half of 2003, while the EU registered a slight up-tick.   

 
After a promising rise in the first quarter of this year, growth in private 

consumption expenditure fell back in the second quarter. Investment 

continued to decline during the first half of the year, while the decline in 

inventories tapered off. Net exports exerted a significant drag on growth for 

the three quarters up to the middle of 2003. Government consumption 

became the main contributor to growth 
in the second quarter of this year. 
 
There are several reasons behind this disappointing economic performance 

and the delay in the recovery that
 was expected earlier this year.
 Confidence 
both on the consumer and business sides at a global level was undermined by 

geopolitical tensions linked to the Iraq war, which created uncertainties about 

the price of oil. For the euro ar
ea consumer, this was exacerbated by 
uncertainties related to future labour and pension income and the adverse 

wealth effects of the prolonged stoc
k market decline. The pressure on 
corporate profitability stemming from the over-investment of the late 90s, the 

long slowdown, ongoing balance sheet ad
justment, and the increased cost of 
external funds, resulting from the stock market decline, is likely to have led 

to the postponement of investment plans.  

 Prospects of a 

turnaround in the 

second half of 2003, 

reaching potential 

growth in 2004 
 Survey indicators have been sending out encouraging signals for the 
prospects of a recovery since April 
of this year. According to these 
indicators, the services sector is leadin
g the way. Within services, the return 
of confidence is more gradual in retail trade. The purchasing managers™ 

index entered expansive territory in July and has now regained the highs of 

early 2002. Consumer confidence is showing slow-but-steady signs of 

improvement, although households remain relatively cautious where major 

purchases are concerned.  

 
Indicators for manufacturing suggest that the recovery is less well established 

in this sector.  Nevertheless, leading 
indicators, such as the business climate 
indicator and the purchasing managers™ indicator for the manufacturing 

sector, have improved. Taken together, these indicators suggest that a 

recession has been avoided and that the turnaround is in progress at present. 

  
Given low interest rates and a stronger exchange rate, the source of growth 

should be the domestic rather than the external side.
 Part of the projected 
recovery in household and business spending in the coming months stems 

from the historically low interest rates, both short-term and long-term. This 

has contributed to an easing of the balance sheet constraints on households 

and businesses through a reduction in debt servicing costs. The rebound in 

stock markets since March of this year and the buoyant housing markets in 

some Member States have also helped to partially restore wealth lost, 

following the bursting of the stock market bubble.  

The real disposable income of house
holds has received a boost from lower 
inflation, which will intensify as infla
tion declines further. The positive real 
income effect is supported by the appr
eciation of the euro and the ensuing 
terms of trade effect, which should be more visible in the medium-term. 

While the average growth in the euro area remains limited to 0.4% in 2003, it 

is projected to rise to 1.8% in 2004 and 2.3% in 2005 (0.8%, 2% and 2.4% in 
3304978 European EconomyEconomic Forecasts, Autumn 2003 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 the EU, respectively).  The upturn is driven by a recovery of domestic 

demand, supported by rising foreign demand, starting in the second half of 

2003. This is, in turn, expected to tr
igger an acceleration of capital formation 
during the course of 2004. 

 A less favourable labour 

market performance 

 
  In the initial phase of the slow growth period, employment held up quite well 
and the rise in the unemployment rate remained limited. The relative stability 

of employment in the services sector partially explains this result. Possible 

additional factors include labour hoarding and more flexible labour contracts. 

 
However, with the prolongation of the do
wnturn, a less favourable picture is 
emerging.  In 2003, some 200,000 jobs (in net terms) are expected to be lost 

in the euro area, the first decline 
since 1994. The unemployment rate is 
forecast to increase to 8.9% (8.1% in th
e EU).  Given the 
sluggish recovery 
and persisting rigidities, very little job creation is foreseen for next year.  

Since the growth of the 
labour force is expected to exceed employment 
growth, the euro area unemployment rate will continue to rise to 9.1% in 

2004 (8.2% in the EU), before edging downwards in 2005.  

 Inflation is starting to 

ease  
 Despite the economic slowdown, headline inflation remained sluggish in 
2003, buoyed up by such temporary factors as the pass-through of oil price 

increases, weather-induced food price 
hikes and rises in indirect taxes. 
Compared to 2.3% in 2002
, headline inflation is exp
ected to remain at 2.1% 
on average in the euro area this year, be
fore falling to 2% next year and 1.7% 
in 2005. Core inflation was also rather sticky during 2003 as a result of 

sluggish productivity growth and the slow pass-through of the effects of the 

euro appreciation into production and consumer prices. However, the 

reduction in unit labour costs, as labour productivity picks up, and wage 

moderation should also lead to a fall in core inflation in the medium-term. 

 Further deterioration of 

the general government 

deficit in the euro area 

with considerable 

differences across 

Member States 

  From 2.2% in 2002, the general government deficit in the euro area (1.9% in 
the EU) is expected to widen to 2.8% of GDP in 2003 (2.7% in the EU). 

Compared to the Commission Spring Foreca
st of 2.5% for the euro area, this 
implies a worsening of the general government position in all countries 

except Belgium, Spain, 
Austria and Portugal. 
 
With respect to 2002, the general 
government balance is expected to 
deteriorate this year in all EU countries, excluding Belgium. Within this 

overall deterioration, a number of country-groupings may be distinguished. 

The first group is composed of two countries, - Germany and France - which 

are expected to exceed the reference va
lue of 3% in 2003, having already 
been in this position in 2002. The second group includes those countries, 

whose deficit has deteriorated this year and/or is projected to be close to the 

reference value: Italy, the Netherland
s, Portugal and the UK. The third group 
consists of those countries, where th
e deficit is forecast to remain below 
1¾% of GDP in 2003: Greece, Ireland, 
Luxembourg and Austria. The final 
group contains those countries, which are still expected to post a surplus in 

2003: Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland and Sweden. 

In 2004, a slight improvement is expected for the euro area with the general 

government deficit declining to 2.7% of GDP (2.6% for the EU). Three 

countries (Germany, France and Portuga
l) are, nonetheless, projected to 
exceed the reference value of 3%. In 200
5, the deficit of the euro area is 
expected to remain at  2.7% of GDP (2.4% for the EU). This is a result of the

 expected acceleration in GDP growth, si
nce the forecast for 2005 is carried 
out on the basis of a ﬁno policy changeﬂ assumption. Bearing in mind this 

assumption, four countries would exceed the reference value in 2005: 

Germany, France, Italy and Portugal. 
Balanced risks to the 

forecast 
 The North American and Asian econ
omies are sending out encouraging 
signals in support of a resumption in world growth. A simultaneous 

acceleration of growth in all major re
gions of the world would establish a 
mutually reinforcing growth momentum. However, long-standing 

macroeconomic imbalances may hold back a sustained expansion of the US 

economy. The Japanese economy is still in the early stages of recovery from 

its protracted recession. Therefore, th
e international environment might turn 
out to be less benign than assumed. 

 
A renewed sharp appreciation in the euro exchange rate could undermine 

activity mainly in the euro-area manufacturing sector, especially in those 

Member States that have recently depended on external demand to generate 

economic growth.  

 
The protracted nature of the downturn, the uncertainties related to the Iraq 

war, and the balance sheet adjustment in the corporate sector have sapped 

confidence, leading to the postponement of consumption and investment 

plans. With the resumption of confid
ence, the release of such pent-up 
demand would accelerate the return to potential growth.  

 
Business confidence can be positively affected by visible progress on 

structural reforms, as well as adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact 

framework. Finally, while geopolitical tensions have not disappeared, they 

have diminished in recent months, th
ereby reducing uncertainty at a global 
level. 
   Acceding countries 
     On average growth in 

the acceding countries 

remained relatively 

resilient–  Despite a difficult international environment, grow
th in the acceding 
countries remained solid at the end of 2002 and in the beginning of 2003.  

Growth was driven by exports and a pick-up in industrial production, while 

private consumption remained robust and additional support was provided by 

lower interest rates.  Reflecting the situation at the world level, investment 

was weak. 

 
Average GDP growth is forecast to be 3.1% in 2003, unchanged compared to 

the Commission Spring Forecasts and representing an acceleration from last 

year™s 2.3%. This compares favourab
ly with the disappointing growth 
performance of the EU, bu
t the aggregate masks different trends at the 
country level.  Growth has been revised downwards for many countries and 

is forecast to be slower compared to
 last year.  The unchanged aggregate 
growth figure is mainly accounted for by Poland, which is gradually 

emerging from two years of slow growth.  For this year, expected growth 

varies form 0.8% in Malta, particularly affected by a fall in tourism due to 

global uncertainty, to 6.6% in Lithuania, which is characterised by buoyant 

investment.

– and is expected to 

accelerate, benefiting 

from EU enlargement, 

but employment 

creation remains low 
 Stimulated by the recovery in the 
EU and the prospect of enlargement, 
average growth in the acceding countries is
 expected to accelerate to 3.8% in 
2004 and to 4.2% in the following year.  This pattern is foreseen in all 

countries, except in the Baltic States, where some slowdown from high levels 

is projected. Increasing exports an
d strong private consumption, 
complemented by a pick-up in investment, are the main drivers of growth.   

 
Linked to the ongoing process of restructuring, employment is contracting in 

the Czech Republic, Poland and Sloven
ia in 2003 and employment creation 
was relatively low in the other countries, except Slovakia and Lithuania.  

Overall, the situation is set to impr
ove, but average em
ployment creation 
remains subdued at 0.6% in 2004 and 1.1% in 2005.  Consequently, the 

unemployment rate will continue to be high at around 15% in 2005. 

 Subdued increase in 

headline inflation 
 Inflation, at about 2.5% on average, fell significantly in 2002 and a few 
acceding countries experienced even falling 
prices during a certain period, as 
a consequence of strong productivity gains.  In 2003, average inflation is 

expected to remain close to the levels observed in the euro area, but 

afterwards an acceleration to 3.5% in 
2004 and 3.1% in 2
005 is foreseen.  
Driving these developments are a return
 to the more normal situation of 
rising prices, the liberalisation of admini
strative prices and a hike of indirect 
taxes.  Underlying inflation should remain subdued as pressures from 

relatively strong wage increases are co
mpensated by productivity growth.   
 Current account deficits 

remain high 
 The average current account deficit is 
forecast to stay at around 4¾% of GDP 
during the forecast period.  This is the combined result of the correction of 

very high deficits in Estonia and Slovakia and a slightly rising deficit in 

Poland and Latvia.  Deficits remain relatively high with little adjustment in 

the Czech Republic and Hungary. 

 Six countries are likely 

to have general 

government deficits in 

excess of 3% of GDP in 

2003 
 The average general government de
ficit in the acceding countries is 
estimated to be 5% of GDP in 2003.  Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 

Malta, Poland and Slovakia are expected 
to have deficits above 3% of GDP. 
With the improvement of the economic situation and a tightening of fiscal 

policy, the general government deficit is expected to decline in 2004 in most 

countries.  A deterioration of the deficit is expected only in Poland (to 5.9% 

of GDP from 4.3%), in Lithuania (to 3.1% from 2.6%) and in Estonia (to 

0.4% from 0.0%).  In 2005, the general government balance improves in all 

acceding countries.

    Other candidate  countries  The other candidate countries will see a further stabilisation in their 
macroeconomic performance.  Growth is expected to converge to around 
4.5% - 5% per year in all three candida
te countries over the forecast period.  
For Turkey, this would mean a slowdown
 compared to the 
very strong 2002 
growth performance, which was, howev
er, characterised by re-emergence 
from the deep crisis in 2001. Hence,
 over the forecasting period, the growth 
performance will follow a more stable and sustainable pattern.  The slight 

deceleration in Romania in 2005 follows 
the strong boost to growth expected 
in 2004, which is an election year. In Turkey and Romania, disinflation 
should continue, driven by the trend r
eal appreciation in 
these countries, a 
strengthening supply side of these economies, driven by strong investment, 
and, partly, more prudent fiscal and monetary policies.  Towards the end of 
the forecasting horizon, inflation is seen 
at single digits in 
both countries, and 
as in Bulgaria with already quite lo
w, but slightly accelerating inflation. 
 
In all three countries, cu
rrent account balances are expected to widen, driven 
by strong domestic demand and slightly worsening price competitiveness of 
their exports on world markets.

  7304978 European Economy 304978 European Economy  Chapter 1 World economy 304978 European Economy 304978 European Economy 1. Incipient global recovery
World GDP growth is expected to be 3.3% in 2003. A 
weak performance in
 the first half of the year has 
reduced the likelihood of a higher growth outcome. 

World growth should acceler
ate to about 4% in 2004 and 2005, above the 1996-2000 average growth rate of 

3.8%. 
While the outlook for the international environment is 
more rosy than in Spring, revisions to regional growth 

forecasts are mixed. In Ca
nada, Norway, Switzerland, 
Australia, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, 

unexpectedly weak growth in 2003 has reduced the 

statistical overhang for 2004 and increases the 
likelihood of a downward revision of growth. Upward 
revisions to 2003 and 2004 are seen in (amongst others) 

Poland, the US, Japan, the CIS and China. More details 
on the regional outlook are to be found in the next 
section. 
So far, convincing signs of recovery are not yet 
showing up in the international trade data for 2003. The 

available data suggest that, over the first seven months 
of 2003, world import volumes are about 3¼% above 
the corresponding volumes for 2002. As a result, world 

merchandise trade is expected to grow by about 4½% in 
2003, accelerating to 7¼% in
 2004 and 8% in 2005. 
Factors to 
support
 global growth 
The main growth-supportin
g factors are accommodative 
macro-economic policies and supportive financial 

conditions Œ partially linked to disinflation Œ and a 

return of confidence, that
 originates in reduced 
geopolitical tensions, strength in asset markets, and 

progress on reform. Accordingly, business confidence 

is improving in the US and the EU. 
Oil prices, which have remained above the central value 
of the OPEC target band since mid-May 2003, are 

exerting a fairly neutral 
effect on growth. Looking 
forward, oil prices are expe
cted to decline gradually, thus supporting the recovery. 
Accommodative macro-economic policies and 
supportive financial conditions 
US fiscal policy remains strongly expansionary, despite 
a scaling down of the President™s original package of 
tax cuts by the US Congress. In the EU, fiscal policy 

has been accommodative by letting the automatic 
stabilisers work during the period of slow growth.  
Meanwhile, disinflation has allowed policy makers to 
bring nominal interest rates to historically low levels 

across the world economy, injecting ample liquidity 
into the financial system. The level of real rates (short-

    term as well as long-term) is also very low; the US real 
short-term rate has been negative since October 2002. 
In the US and Europe, the output gap is expected to 
increase at least up to 2004
, putting downward pressure 
on wages and prices. Therefore, it can be expected that 
monetary conditions will remain conducive to growth. 

In this respect, the recent steepening in the yield curve 
might prove to be a temporary event. 
Asset market developments 
The end of the Iraq war triggered a rise in investors™ 
risk appetite, as manifested in a rally in equity prices 
and a progressive reduction in bond spreads for 

corporate-sector and emerging-market borrowers. With 

ample liquidity available and a widening perception that 

many of the safer asset classes may be overbought, 

international investors have been attracted to higher-
yielding assets in the course of the second quarter of 

2003. Despite this change in investor preferences, 

demand for higher-rated instruments was broadly 
sustained, resulting in a rise in the prices of equities.  
With lower risk premia and risk-free interest rates, 
financing conditions in the global economy have 

improved compared to early 2003. This should help to 

promote recovery Œ particularly by facilitating a de-

leveraging of the corporate 
sector in both the United 
States and the European Union. 
The strength in asset markets increases household 
wealth and should, as a result, support consumption, 

while rising equity markets should support investment.  
The issue of the sustainability of housing prices in 
specific countries and the sustainability of rapid growth 

in the US are linked to the future evolution of global 
long-term interest rates. An increase in long-term 
interest rates has the potential to lead to a significant 

correction of prices
 in specific housing markets and to 
put a brake on the pace of US growth. 
Geopolitical tensions have not disappeared 
Geopolitical tensions have diminished, but have not 
disappeared: the main areas 
of concern are the Middle 
East, Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea. Such tensions 
or terrorist threats remain a 
risk factor to the recovery 
of the world economy. Given that macro-economic 
instruments are largely exploited, responding to such 
events might prove more difficult. 
Oil prices are expected to support the recovery, but 
not yet Oil prices declined sharply 
when the war in Iraq began.

   April 2003. Since then, prices have been on an upward 
trend, peaking at $31 per barrel at mid-October.  
The price rise reflects a numbe
r of supply side factors, 
including the difficulty in restoring the rate of Iraq™s oil 
production, political uncertainty in Venezuela and 
Nigeria, relatively low stock levels, particularly in the 
US, and the recent decision 
of OPEC to reduce their production ceiling.  
Oil prices are expected to diminish gradually over the 
forecast period, to $24 per barrel in the second half of 

2005 (see also Box 2.1). 
The decline reflects the expectation of supply growing faster than demand. The 
lower oil prices will provide some support to the 
recovery. In the event of 
serious lack of compliance 
with OPEC quota or unexpectedly large production 

from non-OPEC sources, this support could be 
relatively strong. 
Progress on structural ref
orm could help to redress global imbalances 
Significant progress on structural reform has the 
potential to boost confidence in the short run and 

potential growth in the medium-term. An example of 
such structural reform in the major industrialised 
economies is Agenda 2010 in Germany (the impact of 

which is too early to assess).  
Progress on structural refo
rm that increases potential 
growth outside the US would probably reduce global 
imbalances, in a medium-term perspective. 
Nevertheless, in a short-term perspective, growth in the 
US is forecast to continue 
to outperform its counterpart 
in most other regions. Global imbalances are expected  
to widen further, with the risk of a fall in the exchange 
rate of the US dollar.  
The failure to reach an agreement at the Cancun 
meeting in September 2003 will restrain the further 
integration of the world economy. This could weigh 

negatively on world growth and aggravate the necessary 
adjustment of imbalances in the medium term.

USA 
The US expansion gained momentum in the second 
quarter of 2003, with consumer spending advancing 

strongly and business investment picking up. For the 
third quarter, the available 
data indicate that growth 
continued to strengthen. Geopolitical uncertainties have 

abated, productivity growth remains strong and 
macroeconomic policy continues to provide support. 

Fiscal policy is particularly
 stimulative with tax cuts 
being implemented and federal spending surging in 

connection with the war in Iraq and its aftermath, 

although concerns abou
t longer-term fiscal 
sustainability are rising. It can be expected that output 

will grow at a relatively high level in the near term, but 

that growth will decelerate in
 the course of 2004, as 
consumer spending loses support from mortgage 

refinancing activity and the expansionary effects of the 

tax cuts diminish. The annual growth rate for 2005 is 
expected to be around potential, but lower than in 2004. 
Japan The Japanese economy is rebounding, supported mainly 
by corporate investment and private consumption, but 
also by exports. For the rest of 2003, Japan should be 
able to profit from the pick-up in the global economy 

and annual growth is expected to be 2.6%. Monetary 
policy has become more expansionary, whereas fiscal 
policy is expected to be roughly neutral. The continuing 
weakness of the banks™ balance sheets and the ongoing 
accumulation of public debt 
make the current upturn 
vulnerable. Growth is therefor
e expected to fall back to 
close-to-potential over the forecast period. 
Canada  The Canadian economy has slowed down considerably 
since 2002 reflecting, in particular, diminishing net 
exports. The impact of SARS
 and an isolated case of 
BSE have also been weighing on the economy. As a 
result, output growth turned slightly negative in the 
second quarter. Against the background of stronger 
growth in the United States and supportive 

macroeconomic policies, it can
 be expected that the 
Canadian economy will regain momentum towards the 
end of 2003. The upturn will, however, be mitigated 

somewhat by the recent appr
eciation of the Canadian dollar. In 2004 and 2005, growth should stabilise 

around its long-term potential. 
Switzerland and Norway 
The Swiss
 economy has been hit hard by the global 
downturn and by the sharp 
appreciation of the franc. 
Private consumption growth is
 expected to recover only 
in 2004, as labour market conditions are bleak. 
Investment remains weak and is expected to contract 

again in 2003, before gradually picking up in 2004. As 
a result, growth is expected to be only 0.1% this year, 
while recovering to 1.9% in 2004. 
Private consumption Œ boosted by tax cuts, low 
inflation and real wage growth Œ is expected to remain 

the main dynamic element of the 
Norwegian
 economy.  
From 2004 onwards, export growth is expected to rise 

again, on the back of a global recovery and a 

depreciating currency. Fixed investment is expected to 

recover in 2004 as well. While sluggish growth of 1% is 
expected in 2003, this is forecast to increase to 2.1% in 
2004. 
Acceding and other Candidate Countries 
In anticipation of accession 
in May 2004, the detailed 
forecasts for the Acceding Countries
 and the Member 
States are merged in this i
ssue for the first time. Where 
available, data for the same set of variables as the 
existing Member States are pr
esented in the statistical 
annex. Chapters 4 and 5 of this issue deal respectively 

with the forecast for the Acceding Countries and the 
Other Candidate Countries
.  CIS For Russia
 and the other New Independent States, 
growth prospects have been revised upwards. Due to 
higher-than-expected oil prices, GDP growth in Russia 
is expected to be close to 6% in 2003 and 5% in 
subsequent years. Growth prospects in 
Ukraine
 and the 
other New Independent States are also rather 
favourable. In 
Ukraine
, GDP growth is projected to 
accelerate from 4.1% in 2
002 to 5.5% in 2003, 
supported by both strong export performance and 
14304978 European EconomyChapter 1 
World economy  domestic demand. 
Asia Asia is expected to resume buoyant growth in the 
second half of 2003 after recovering from the fallout 
from SARS, the war in Iraq and tensions on the Korean 

Peninsula. The 
Chinese
 economy is foreseen to expand 
by about 8% annually th
roughout the whole forecast 
period. Rising exports, as a result of a favourable 

exchange rate, increasing in
flows of FDI and robust 
domestic demand are expected to drive growth in the 

second half of the year. Gr
owth-supportive policies are 
also likely to underpin economic activity into the future. 
Korea
 is forecast to rebound after a short recession 
earlier this year. 
Latin America 
Growth in Latin America is being held back in 2003 by 
contractions in 
Venezuela
 and 
Uruguay
, but it is likely 
to accelerate in 2004. 
Argentina
 is expected to grow 
fast after the huge contraction in 2002. In 
Brazil
, export 
demand is strong, but domestic demand has so far been 

subdued. The 
Mexican economy is still tracking the US 
economy and the recovery is, therefore, expected to 
gradually gain momentum during the course of the 
forecast period. 
 Africa 
Growth in Africa, excluding OPEC countries, is 
expected to reach just above 3% in 2003, driven mostly 

by domestic demand and some pick-up in non-oil 
commodity prices. In spite 
of the recent eruption of 
violence in the 
Côte d™Ivoire
 and Liberia
, prospects for 
2004 should improve further, with growth expected to 

reach around 4%, supported 
mainly by rising non-oil 
commodity prices and a resumption in world demand.

  304978 European Economy  Chapter 2 The economy of the euro area 304978 European Economy 304978 European Economy 1. Confidence returning amid signs of 
recovery Economic activity stagnated in the first half of 2003 
In the first quarter, GDP bare
ly increased in the EU and 
did not grow at all in the euro area compared to the last 
quarter of 2002, in spite of supportive consumption. 
Investment and net exports made a negative 
contribution to growth. All components of demand, 
except public consumption, but including the previously 
resilient household spending, were subdued in the 

second quarter. Three countr
ies (Germany, Italy and the 
Netherlands) were technically in recession and French 

GDP contracted partially due to strikes and possibly 

due to an increase in the number of recorded days off. 
As a result, GDP was flat in the EU and contracted by 
-0.1% in the euro area in th
e second quarter of 2003. 
The second mild dip of growth at the end of the second 

quarter was mainly the result of the contribution of net 

exports to growth, which became negative at the end of 

2002, as exports contracted while imports were flat. 
Putting aside the temporary adverse profile of exports, 
the slowdown in economic growth in the euro area 

since mid-2001 did not deepen in the first half of 2003.  
Exports put a drag on growth 
Export growth was subdued for most of 2002, and net 
exports put a significant drag on growth for the three

 moderate pace in 2002 as described in chapter 1. 
However, other countries' exports seem to have held up 

better than euro area exports, and the euro area is likely 
to have experienced a slight loss in market shares. A 
reason for this is to be
 found in euro area price 
competitiveness, which has deteriorated in the short 

run. The nominal effective exchange rate of the euro 

appreciated by about 8% ag
ainst the 23 major trading 
partners of the  euro  area  between  early 1999 and 

mid-2003. From the end of 2000 to mid-2003, export 

prices in euro decreased by 
10%, and increased by more 
than 10% in terms of "the foreign currency" given 

nominal exchange rate developments. Econometric 

studies generally estimate that 50% to 70% of exchange 
rate movements is passed through to non-oil import 
prices during one year. This would suggest that 

exporters (from the euro 
area but also from trading 
partners) tend to postpone the trimming of their mark-

ups when their currency is appreciating (more in 

services than in goods). Some
 market shares are lost in 
the short run during the process of price adjustment, but 

these are generally regained in the medium term.  
In previous upturns of the nineties (1993, 1998 and 
2000), net exports had a strongly positive contribution 

to growth, which heralded the turning point in the cycle. 

At this juncture, exports are still not providing a driving 
force for growth. 
Consumption dwindled again recently 
After a two-quarter contraction at the end of 2001 and a 
subsequent rebound until the first quarter of 2003, 
household spending in the euro area dwindled again in 

the second quarter of 2003, at a time when most 
economic indicators had stopped deteriorating. This 

conceals different patterns 
of consumption for three 
main categories of countries within the European 
Union.  
For the first category of countries (UK, Spain, Finland 
and Greece), buoyant consumption, sustained by a 

resilient job market and rising house prices, made a 

large contribution to growth (at least up to this year in 
the UK).  
In France, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria, 
consumption was relatively resilient over the three last 
quarters of 2002. The marked fall in interest rates 
provided some relief to households in the form of 

reduced mortgage interest payments. This, together 
with the wealth effect of th
e continued increase in real 
estate prices, is likely to have partially offset the effects 
of low confidence, the slump in equity markets and 
concerns about the on-going reform of pension systems. 
The resilient job market in Italy also contributed to 

sustain consumption in 2002. However, the situation 
may have deteriorated in the first half of 2003 in some 
of these countries to the ex
tent that additional factors 
have continued to weigh on confidence and permanent 
income. Such factors include 
the deterioration in the job 
market and rising government budget deficits, which 
cast doubt on the sustainability of the easing of fiscal 
policy.  
By contrast, in Germany and Portugal, consumption 
remained flat throughout the last six quarters apart from 

a blip in the first quarter of 2003 for Germany, which 

may be explained by a release of pent-up demand 
against a background of aggressive seasonal sales. In 
Germany, no temporary support was to be found in the 

flat housing market. Portuguese households have also 
been adjusting to very high indebtedness.

The economy of the euro area
    
   A protracted slump in investment 
Investment recorded a signif
icant contraction of 1.2% 
(quarter on quarter) in the first quarter and a further fall 
of 0.2% in the second quarter of 2003. This confirms 
that the slight upturn that occurred in the second half of 
2002 was mainly due to speci
al factors, such as the 
impact of the Tremonti law in Italy and of the 
rebuilding after the floods in Germany and Austria. The 
relative reduction in the pace of contraction in the 

second quarter should be vi
ewed with caution. The 
quarterly national accounts estimate for investment may 

be revised significantly in the upcoming releases and 

the less bleak change in the 
second quarter might be the 
result of a technical adjustme
nt to the first quarter. 
The exceptional length of this phase of contraction in 

investment compared to the slowdowns of the nineties 

stems from a high level of over-investment at world 
level before the end of the ICT bubble, balance-sheet 
adjustment and subdued demand in the past few years. 

The level of capacity utilisation has hovered below its 
historical average for seve
n consecutive quarters and it 
recently declined further, wh
ich is consistent with the 
mild second dip in growth 
during the current cycle.  
No signal from inventories 
The decline in inventories tapered off in the first half of 
2003, after six consecutive quarters of depletion. Due to 
the base effect, the overh
ang of the change in 
inventories in mid 2003 is 0.5% of GDP in the euro 
area. This can be attributed mainly to a technical 
correction after the protract
ed depletion and special 
factors such as stock building of oil reserves before the 
war in Iraq. The very slow upturn in inventories, against 
the background of flat domestic demand, does not yet 
provide much indication of an upturn in the cycle: 

demand expectations remained sombre in the first half 
of this year. 
A sustained rise in government consumption
 Government consumption growth continued to increase 
at a steady pace in the first half of 2003. After having 
grown in 2002 by about 3% year-on-year (i.e. faster 

than during any period in the nineties), the annual rate 
of change has declined to 2% in 2003 (due to base 
effects). This is nevertheless in the high range in 

comparison to growth rates during the nineties. The 
recent budgetary stan
ce thus remained slightly counter-
cyclical. The contribution of government expenditure to 
growth was one third of that of total consumption in the 
first half of 2003. 
 Protracted weakness in the industrial sector  
According to quarterly national accounts, the economic 
slowdown was pronounced in the industrial and 

construction sectors in the first half of this year. After a 
pick-up in the second half of last year, activity was flat 
in the wholesale and retail sector. The financial sector 

(especially banking) benefited from the improved 
outlook on equity markets and the resumption of 
corporate credit growth 
to the corporate sector.

     Box 2.1: Some specificities behind the forecasts
 Exchange rates 
A constant nominal exchange rate in the ERMII (DKK/EUR 
rates) and constant real rates (nominal rates adjusted for 
changes in GDP deflators) for Sweden, the UK and non-EU 
currencies are assumed.  
The reference period used for the exchange rate constancy 
assumption is the average exchange rate of 1 to 16 October 
2003, which is attributed to the fourth quarter of 2003. The 
average USD/EUR rate for that period was 1.17 and the 
JPY/EUR rate 128.6.  This leads to average USD/EUR rates 
of 1.13 in 2003 and 1.16 in 2004 and 1.15 in 2005, and 
JPY/EUR rates of 130.8, 125.8 and 122 in 2003, 2004 and 
2005 respectively.  
For the Acceding Countries, curr
encies are treated according 
to their policy regimes. Hence for the CYP (Cyprus pound), 
EEK (Estonian kroon), HUF (Hungarian forint) and the LTL 
(Lithuanian litas), constant nominal exchange rates vis-à-vis 
the euro are assumed. For the PLN (Polish zloty), CZK 
(Czech koruna), SIT (Slovenian tolar) and SKK (Slovakian 
koruna), constant real rates against the euro are assumed. For 
currencies pegged to a basket (Latvian lat and Maltese lira), 
the future rate is deduced from the evolution of the currencies 
constituting the basket. 
Interest rates
 Short-term interest rates are set in order to reflect the 
objective of monetary policy with respect to price stability.  

Long-term interest rate 
assumptions are based on 
developments in short-term rates and an assessment of 
economic conditions.  Attentio
n is paid to international financial linkages, market 
expectations and budgetary 
developments. Commodity prices
 Commodity prices are forecast taking into account market 
conditions. In the case of oil prices
 special attention is paid to 
futures prices. Prices for Brent oil are, accordingly, forecast 

at 28.3 USD/bl in 2003, 25.6 USD/bl in 2004 and 
24.1 USD/bl in 2005.   
Prices of primary commodities, excluding fuels, are assumed 
to increase by 7.3% in 2003 and to rise further by 1.9% in 
2004 and by 0.7% in 2005.  The strongest price increases in 
2003 apply to the group of agricultural non-food products. 
Food prices are expected to 
decline in 2004 and 2005, while 
the prices of metals are expected to rise during the forecast 

horizon.   Budgetary data
 Data for 2002 are based on the Excessive Deficit Procedure 
notification, submitted by the Member States in September 
2003. This information is found in a Eurostat Report on 15 
September (press release 106/2003). For 2003, the budgets 
and information on the execution 
of these budgets is taken 
into account. For 2004, budgets 
adopted or presented to 
parliaments and all other measur
es known in sufficient detail 
are taken into consideration. For 2005, the "no-policy 
change" assumption used in the forecasts implies the 
extrapolation of measures and trends that are known at the 
time of completion of the forecasts. 
The government balances reported in the notification may be 
different from those published in the national accounts, 
because of an amendment to ESA95. According to 
Regulation (EC) N° 2558/2001 on the reclassification of 
settlements under swaps agreements and forward rate 
agreements, interest flows under 
swaps have been reclassified 
from ﬁincome propertyﬂ to ﬁfinan
cial accountﬂ. However, the 
Regulation states the need for a specific treatment of these 

flows for data transmitted 
under the Excessive Deficit 
Procedure, allowing for interest expenditure to include 

swaps, contrary to ESA95 new rule
s. In the forecasts, it is the 
EDP definition of general go
vernment balances which is 
presented. Therefore, the calculation of general government 
expenditure does include 
swap-related settlements. 
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output gaps
 Year 2004 is a leap year. The addition of one extra working 

day implies that EU annual ou
tput increases, other things 
being equal, by about 0.4 of 
a percentage point.  Annual GDP 
figures are not adjusted for the number of working days, 
while quarterly national accounts figures of most countries 
are. This implies that the simple addition of the four quarters 
of a single year may not add up exactly to the annual figure. 
Moreover, the calculation of potential GDP, from which the 
output gap is derived, does not 
involve any adjustment for the 
number of working days in the 
leap year, because this is 
considered to be a temporar
y phenomenon, which should not 
affect the cyclically adjusted balances that are calculated 

using these output gaps. Hence,
 for 2004, the increase in the 
negative output gap would be larger in the absence of this 

calendar phenomenon. 
   22304978 European Economy 2. A return to potential growth in the 
course of 2004 2.1. The EU economy is likely to bottom out 
in the second half of this year 
Although the latest hard data available do not yet 
provide clear-cut evidence of
 the bottoming out of the 
EU economy, survey data are signalling an upturn at 

least in some sectors of the economy. This overall 
picture is supporting our projection of an upturn of 
growth, underpinned by domestic consumption and a 

favourable international environment, including a 
recovery in exports. In the second half of 2003, quarter-
on-quarter GDP growth in the 
euro area is expected to be 
0.3%. 
Consumption growth to resume in the second half of 
2003 led by expenditure on services 
The latest available survey data have sent out 
encouraging signals for the ma
in sectors of the economy. 
The service sector is leadi
ng the recovery. According to 
most survey indicators, th
e turnaround in sentiment 
started as early as in Apr
il of this year. The Commission 
confidence indicator for serv
ices for the euro area 
climbed to an eighteen-month high in September, with 

the German indicator improving by no less than thirty 
four points since January of this year. The Reuters 
purchasing managers index has entered expansive 

territory since July and is back to early 2002 highs. In 
addition, the recovery seems to be more firmly 
established than last year, when the short-lived upturn in 

confidence was mainly due to the very volatile 
expectations component of the indicator. This time, 
opinions on the present situation have improved more 

rapidly than expectations fo
r the months ahead, closing 
the large gap that appeared last year.  
Within the service sector, reta
il trade is characterised by 
a more gradual rise in confidence. Retail sales remained 
subdued in Germany, France and Italy until August, 
according to the data releas
ed by national statistical 
institutes. Signals of a slow-but-steady recovery are also 
provided by the Commission services' consumer 
confidence indicator. Since April, all elements have 
displayed a positive trend, including expectations about 

unemployment, prices and th
e economic situation in the 
future. Households remain relatively cautious only 

where major purchases are concerned. All in all, 

indications revealed by 
surveys augur well for a 
recovery in household consumption, and support the 

forecast of quarter-on-quarter
 growth of 0.2% and 0.3% 
respectively in the last two quarters of 2003. 
Slower upturn in the manufacturing sector 
The recovery in the manufacturing sector appears to be 
less well established. The three-month moving average 
of industrial production excluding construction had not 
yet bottomed out in the summer. However, a comparison 

of the industrial production index with the business 
climate indicator, which is sli
ghtly leading, suggests that 
the upturn could be in progress at present. Moreover, the 
leading purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the 
manufacturing sector moved above the threshold 
separating recession from expansion in September. The

return to positive growth territory can be thus expected 
towards the end of the last quarter of 2003. In the 
meantime, confidence is likely to remain more subdued 
in such sectors as manufacture of motor vehicles, 

machinery, investment and intermediate goods. Export 
order books were still reporting muted trade in 
September, except in Germany according to the 

purchasing managers' index. 
Favourable external conditions  
Domestic demand growth will also be supported by the 
improving international environment. Signs of 
accelerating growth are emerging in many parts of the 
world (see chapter 1). In pa
rticular, growth accelerated 
in the US at an annualised rate of 3.3% in the second 
quarter of 2003; the Japanese economy is performing 
better than expected; 
acceding countries are 
experiencing relatively strong growth and some Asian 
countries, such as China, 
are also registering robust 
growth following the end of SARS. As a result, the euro 
area is expected to benefit from a strengthening of 
foreign demand in the coming months that will offset the 
temporary decline in the price-competitiveness of euro 
area products. Exports are expected to increase by about 
1% quarter-on-quarter in the second half of this year, 

and the contribution of net exports to growth should turn 
positive, with imports expanding at the same pace. 
2.2. Balance-sheet constraints in the 
private sector have eased The outlook for domestic demand is influenced by the 
financial situation of the private sector. Typically, 

companies and households te
nd to borrow against their 
expected earnings in an economic upswing and to 

consolidate their debts to fr
ee up disposable income in 
the downswing. Amid a pron
ounced cyclical upswing, 
leverage ratios in both corporate and household sectors 

rose substantially in the course of the 1990s. The 
subsequent economic downturn, long but shallow by 

normal standards, has be
en characterised by de-
leveraging of the corporate 
sector, a continued increase 
in household debt, and some concern about the health of 

financial intermediaries.  
As a sustained recovery in
 corporate spending on 
investment is unlikely until this de-leveraging process 
has been completed, a key question in assessing 
economic prospects is whethe
r adjustment of corporate 
balance sheets remains a factor
 weighing on investment 
activity. In the household sector, the main issue is the 

sustainability of rising levels of debt Œ particularly 
related to house purchases.  
Corporate
 sector
 Excessive leverage, in the aftermath of the bursting of 
the equity price bubble in 2000, has acted as a drag on 

investment during the current economic downturn. 
Under substantial financial pressure and with earnings 
prospects revised downwards, companies in the euro-

area, like their US counterparts, have responded by 
reducing investment, inventories and debt. The total 
stock of debt of the euro-area non-financial corporate 

sector has broadly stabilised, in terms of GDP, since the 
beginning of 2002. Companies have also modified the 
term structure of their debt, reducing significantly the 

share of short-term borrowing after mid-2001. 
Meanwhile, lower interest rates have eased the cost of 
their debt.  
A recovery in profitability is key to the restoration of 
corporate balance sheets. Alth
ough labour productivity 
and profitability picked up in the euro area in 2002, 

since the beginning of 2003 developments in profit 

margins have been less fa
vourable, due to a near

24304978 European EconomyChapter 2 
The economy of the euro area
 stagnation of productivity. Furthermore, euro-area 
companies, which had made substantial investments in 
the United States in the ph
ase of dollar appreciation, 
have also suffered from th
e negative impact of the 
subsequent dollar depreciation on the book value of such 

investments and the revenues from the activity of their 
US subsidiaries. 
At present, it is difficult to assess the extent to which de-
leveraging has been achieved. An optimistic view, 
supported by the recovery in equity prices in 2003 and 
the continuing narrowing of corporate bond spreads, 

especially for lower-rated borrowers, is that sufficient 
progress has been made in lowering leverage. This 
progress, together with a modest recovery in 

profitability, would have largely freed companies from 
balance-sheet constraints. 
Equally encouraging are the 
signs of a tentative pick-up in the growth of debt 
financing in the euro area. Issuance of corporate debt 
securities, in particular, acceler
ated to an annual rate of 
12.7% in the second quarter of 2003 (from 4.1% at the 

end of 2002). There is also some recovery in secondary 
issuance of equity, although
 initial public offering (IPO) 
activity has remained weak.  
In contrast, bank loans, which remain the largest source 
of financing for euro area companies,  have accelerated 
only slightly in the first half of the year. Besides, 
although corporate bond sp
reads typically anticipate 
movements in bank-loan spreads, there is so far no clear 
evidence that the widening 
of margins between lending 
rates and comparable market interest rates has come to 
an end. This is consistent with the reportedly still 
cautious attitude of euro-area banks in extending loans to 
enterprises. Some more enco
uraging signs can be found 
in higher frequency data for loans to the whole private 

sector. Loans granted by euro area banks and central 
government to the whole private sector (non-financial 
corporations, households and other financial 

intermediaries) accelerated to
 about 5% in July and 
August, up from 4.5% in the second quarter of the year. 

This pick up in loans to the private sector may suggest 

an underlying acceleration in bank lending to companies 
during the summer, though it would be premature to 
consider this as firm evidence of a turning point.  
To sum up, financial constraint
s for euro area enterprises 
have certainly eased since the Spring forecast. Higher 
financial asset prices and lower interest rates have 
improved the financing conditions for companies and 

facilitated the restoration of their balance sheets. Total 
debt financing has accelerated in 2003, mainly due to 
strong securities issuance, although there are tentative 

indications of a pick-up in bank lending. At the same 
time, debt levels and gearing ratios (e.g. the debt/equity 
ratio) remain high, banks maintain a cautious attitude in 

extending loans to companies and the recovery in equity 
prices has lost steam since the summer. Without firmer 
indications of a recovery in output growth and profits, 
financial markets still appear vulnerable to a reversal in 
sentiment. All this suggests that a return to the fast 

accumulation of debt of the late 1990s, and thus to the 
buoyant real and financial investment activity of those 
years, is unlikely in the near term.  
Household sector 
Euro area households have continued to accumulate debt 
in the course of the economic downturn, mostly to 
finance house purchases. Mortgage lending growth, 
which  has generally been strongest in those Member 

States, where house prices have increased most Œ such 
as, Greece, Spain, Ireland, and the Netherlands, 
remained above a robust 7% in
 the first two quarters of 
2003.

25304978 European EconomyEconomic Forecasts, Autumn 2003   
While the interest burden for households has been 
contained by the sharp decline in nominal and real 
interest rates, abnormally high debt levels increase the 
vulnerability of household spending to adverse 

developments in households™ income or a rise in interest 
rates Œ especially where mortgage contracts include 
variable or short-term adjustable interest rates.  
In several Member States ther
e is the risk of a housing-
market bubble, although some countries have lately seen 
a deceleration of prices. Ireland, Greece and Spain still 

experienced a double-digit increase in nominal house 
prices in 2002, while substantial but less marked 
increases were recorded in 
Belgium, France and Italy. 
However, prices began to decelerate in the Netherlands 
and Ireland in the course of the year.  
Notwithstanding the danger that
 a significant increase in 
interest rates, or a further deterioration of the labour 
market could at some point induce a sizeable correction 

in the housing markets of some Member States, for the 
euro area as a whole the risk that balance sheet 
constraints on households might act as a brake on 

consumption appears low at present. 
The banking sector 
There have been concerns that difficulties experienced 
by euro area financial intermediaries, in particular by 

parts of the banking system, were causing a shortage of 
funds for enterprises, in par
ticular for SMEs. While there 
is only anecdotal evidence th
at this has been the case 
(not least because of the difficulties in disentangling the 
role of demand and supply factors), a solid banking 
system is clearly an importa
nt support for a recovery.  
In general, concerns about the health of the euro area 

banking sector have eased during 2003. Despite the 
sharp deceleration in corp
orate lending and falling 
equity markets, euro area banks have on average 
remained profitable, well capitalised and with sound 
solvency ratios. With falling commission income, rising 

loan-loss provisions and sharply decelerating business 
lending, bank profitability has been supported mainly by 
buoyant retail activity, in particular by the atypically 

robust mortgage market in the current downturn. 
Profitability has also benefited from significant cost-
cutting and business restructuring, e.g. via the closure or 

selling of investment banking activities, insurance 
subsidiaries, specialised credit providers etc. Other 
factors likely to have contributed to the resilience of the 

sector include the capital buffers accumulated in the 
1990s, improved risk management techniques and the 
spreading of risk via the rapidly expanding market for 

credit-risk transfer. 
All in all, a shortage in
 the supply of bank credit Œ 
related to problems in the banking sector - does not 
appear to be a risk to th
e recovery of the euro area 
economy at present. In addition, the growing integration 
of European financial markets, by improving access to 
foreign lenders, may alleviate the negative effects from 

local problems in the intermed
iation sector, at least for 
larger borrowers. However, the delay in economic 

recovery means that the buffe
rs available to banks are 
somewhat reduced, and parts of the banking system 
could be vulnerable to further sustained weakness in the 
real sector and/or renewed 
weakness in equity markets. 
Moreover, other categories of intermediaries, in 
particular insurance and reinsurance companies, remain 
under considerable stress,
 with potential spill-over 
effects on the banking system and a direct impact on 
economic activity through the availability and cost of 
insurance cover.

The economy of the euro area
 2.3. Further outlook: a return to 
potential growth  
 The euro area is expected to experience a broad-based 
recovery, driven by growing domestic demand and rising 

foreign demand, beginning in the second half of 2003. 

This would, in turn, trig
ger an acceleration of capital 
formation in the course of 2004. As a result, the euro 

area should return to potential growth in mid 2004. 
 The driving forces behind the recovery of household 
spending 
Private consumption growth is expected to gain 
momentum from 1.3% in 2003 to 1.6% in 2004 and 2% 

in 2005. Several factors support a recovery in household 
spending in the coming months.  
First, with the loosening of monetary policy, interest 
rates, both short-term and long-term, are at historical 
lows. This has contributed to an easing of the balance 
sheet constraints of households through a reduction in 
debt servicing costs. The re
bound in stock markets since 
March of this year and the buoyant housing markets in 

some Member States have also helped to restore wealth 

lost following the bursting of the stock market bubble.  
Second, the real disposable income of households has 
received a boost from lowe
r inflation, which will 
intensify as inflation declines further. The positive real 
income effect is supported 
by the appreciation of the 
euro and the ensuing terms of
 trade effect, which should 
be more visible in the medium-term. 
Third, economic confidence could be boosted by recent 
reform initiatives, which signal a political willingness to 
tackle long-standing structural problems. Decisions on 
structural reforms of unsustainable pension and social 

security systems can, by 
reducing uncertainty about 
future income, have positive spill-over effects on 

consumption expenditure in the medium-term through a 

reduction in incentives fo
r precautionary savings.  
Given these supportive forces, and in view of the fact 

that more than two years of restrained spending on the 

part of households has seen
 the accumulation of pent-up

demand, this demand could be progressively liberated in 
the course of 2004 and 2005. Such a development was 
observed in the 1994 recovery, even against a 
background of moderately increasing disposable income. 
... but exports are also
 expected to recover 
The upturn in world trade an
d GDP growth is expected to lift euro area exports in a scenario similar to the 1995 
upturn. While the depreciation of the dollar until mid-
1995 exerted a temporary 
dampening effect on the 
exports of the current euro 
area countries (except Italy), 
rapid exports growth resumed in the course of 1996 

since the momentum of world trade did not decelerate 
and exporters adapted their ma
rk-ups to the new level of 
exchange rate. 
Past experience shows that 
a significant ac
celeration in world trade growth dominates the potential effects of 
large fluctuations in currencies exchange rates in the 
medium term. Exports of goods are expected to grow by 

5.2% in 2004 and 6.7% in 2005 compared to a marginal 
increase of 0.1% expected 
for 2003. This performance 
appears to be compatible with the current level of the 

euro and world trade growth of about 6 to 7%. 
A gradual revival of investment  
The investment cycle in the 
euro area was driven by the 
pattern of exports rather than domestic components of 
demand during the first half of the nineties. The situation 

has not significantly changed since the mid-nineties, 
although domestic demand recovered and credit and 
monetary conditions were more favourable to 
investment. As a result of the very strong foreign direct 
investment flows from Europe to the US during the last 
five years, the exposure of th
e corporate sector to global 
developments has increased. A more robust upturn in 
world GDP and trade growth is likely to gradually foster 
investment decisions, bolstered by an improvement in 

corporate indebtedness and profitability. 
Putting aside an easing in balance sheet constraints, 
profitability has broadly improved since mid-2002 with 
the reduction in labour hoarding, the containment of

 in labour costs), de-leveraging and the favourable impact 
of lower corporate spreads and interest rates.  
Moreover, the fact that the co
ntraction in investment has 
already lasted two years (in th
e absence of a recession at 
the level of the euro area) 
provides some hope for an 
imminent recovery. Some replacement investment might 
be expected until growing demand increases capacity 

utilisation and triggers the investment multiplier.  
Last but not least, historically low interest rates, low 
corporate spreads and the recovery of stock markets set 

optimal conditions for an increase in capital stock, as 
soon as demand creates profit opportunities. Investment 
is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2004 and by 3.0% in 

2005 after a slight contraction of 1.0% in 2003, resulting 
mainly from a negative carry-over of 1.6% at the end of 
the second quarter. 
 2.4 The balance of risks  
 Will domestic demand improve decisively? 
As in 1995-96, the current recovery is likely to rely more 
on domestic demand than during other upturns in the 
nineties. Risks to such a scenario may be more on the 

downside with respect to household demand for three 
main reasons. First, structur
al reforms in the euro area 
still have some way to go. Pension reforms are still in 
the pipeline and the social security system is heavily in 
deficit in several countries. Labour market reforms also 
have some way to go. Experience has shown that the 

economic pay-back to structur
al reforms can take some 
time, but can be achieved more rapidly if such reforms 

are comprehensive in nature. Furthermore, the large 

budget deficits recorded by 
the three largest countries of 
the euro area might be a reason for households to 

increase savings, in view of exp
ected future taxes. In this 
respect, it could be somewhat premature to expect 
positive results from structural reforms.  
Secondly, the favourable impact
 of increased real estate 
prices is likely to disappear from the second half of 
2003, and might indeed turn negative in case of a strong 
rise in interest rates. 
Thirdly, the lagged response of labour markets to the 
upturn means that employment growth will be weak next 

year (see next chapter). 
Lower disposable income, 
combined with a potential increase in the saving rate due 

to job insecurity, could weaken the initial recovery in 

domestic demand.  
In addition, there are also some downside risks to 
investment due to some uncertainties as to whether the 
balance sheet adjustment pr
ocess within the corporate 
sector is yet complete in Europe. 
International environment: safe harbour within 
reach? On the external side, the global upturn will hinge on the 
sustainability of the recovery in the US and, to a lesser 

extent, in Japan and other Asian countries. Downside 

risks relate to the sustainability of the US momentum, 
the robustness of the recovery in Japan and, finally, the 
possible resurgence of geopolitical tensions, in particular 

the side-effects of the on-going tensions in the Middle 
East. Although declining, the price of oil has remained 
under pressure after the war in Iraq, with a recent 

tightening of OPEC quotas. The persistence of large US 
fiscal and current account deficits creates a risk that 
foreign investors become reluctant to finance these 

deficits and that a sharp weakening of the USD could 
ensue. Since currencies of
 other euro area trading 
partners are pegged to the USD, this could have a large 
impact on the nominal effec
tive exchange rate of the 
euro area.  
Upside risks related to global growth, and also to the 
domestic environment 
World macroeconomic policies are supportive, 
particularly monetary policies targeting a return to 
growth and the stabilisation of exchange rates. Some 
Asian central banks appear to be committed to 

preventing the USD from depreciating sharply. This 
configuration of policies might lead to a simultaneous 
recovery in domestic dema
nd in the major economies, 
that would spill over into a greater boost to international 
trade.  -5-4-3-2-101219992000200120022003

In the euro area, the policy mix is also conducive to 
growth, with low real interest rates by historical 
standards and ample liquidity. If the opportunity is taken 
against this favourable ba
ckground to carry out 
additional structural reforms in Europe, a boost 
confidence in the short run 
can be expected together 
with higher potential growth in the medium-term. This 
combination of positive factors could trigger a release of 
pent-up demand and a decline in saving rates, which are 
currently above their long-term average.  
  30304978 European Economy 3. Weak labour market prospects 
3.1. A less resilient labour market 
Labour market adjustment has recently intensified  
From the initial phase of the slow growth period up to 
mid-2002, employment held up quite well and the rise 

in the unemployment rate remained limited. This was 

due mainly to the relative stability of employment in the 
services sector, which is the largest employer. At the 
same time, increased flexibility of work organisation 
has allowed for some reduction in working hours and 
for more flexible labour contract arrangements rather 

than job losses. Initially, since the downturn was 
expected to be milder than that which has materialised, 
some labour hoarding may have also played a role, 

particularly in Member States with relatively high 
levels of employment protection. Nevertheless, this 
conclusion is still tentative since, according to available 

evidence, employment react
ed broadly in line with 
economic activity and wages. 
From mid-2002 to date, the labour market has been less 
resilient. As the downturn became more protracted and 
perception of its length altere
d, firms accelerated labour 
cutbacks to adjust their 
balance sheets and restore 
profitability. This is in contrast to the beginning of the 

slow growth period, when the adjustment was mainly 
achieved through cutting capital spending. Employment 

growth has come to a standstill since the second half of 
2002. Year-on-year growth, which peaked at over 2% 
in 2000, fell to 0% in the first two quarters of 2003. 
Quarter-on-quarter growth was also 0%, the same rate 
as that recorded in the second half of last year. 
Following the marked slowdown in growth over the 
past two years and paralleling the weakening 
employment performance, labour shedding has 

intensified. The harmonised unemployment rate in the 
euro area has gradually incr
eased from 8% in August 
2001 to 8.8% in August 2003.  
A breakdown of employment developments by sector of 
activity shows that, while manufacturing and 

construction have continued to lose jobs over the past 

two years, employment growth in the service sector has 
remained positive so far, despite subdued economic 
activity. Year-on-year, empl
oyment in manufacturing 
and construction has been contracting since the 
beginning of 2001 and was down also in the second 
quarter of this year, by 1.5% and 0.4% respectively. In 

contrast, employment has increased by 0.7% in the 
services sector, which has remained the most dynamic 

sector of the economy for employment performance. 
The services sector has been less severely hit by the 
economic downturn compared 
to the industrial sector, 
partly because of the fo
rmer sectors' limited
 exposure to 
international competition. However, the speed of 

growth has also been decelerating in the services sector 

since the third quarter of 2000, when it peaked at 3.1% 
(year-on-year).  3.2. A delayed labour market rebound 
Limited employment growth in 2004 
Economic activity practically stagnated in the first half 
of 2003, while growth was mildly positive in the second 

half of the previous year. At the same time, 
employment has remained broadly constant during the 
first half of 2003, which implies stagnating 

productivity. Productivity is not expected to gain 
strength before the beginning of 2004. Short-term 
prospects for employment are expected to remain 

sluggish, since labour market developments always lag 
behind economic growth trends. Further progress in 
productivity is necessary to maintain profitability, 

competitiveness and, finally, job creation through 
higher investment. Furthermore, despite the progress 
made in restoring corporate balance sheets and better 

financial conditions compared to last spring, the 
balance sheet adjustment is unlikely to have fully run its 
course.  The need for firms to focus on cost reductions would 
therefore imply a continuation of the slow rise of 

employment in the coming months, together with the 
prospects of a mild recovery.

31304978 European EconomyEconomic Forecasts, Autumn 2003   
 The sluggish short-term prospects for employment are 
supported by developments in recent business surveys. 

Since the publication of the Commission Spring 
Forecasts, employment expecta
tions have continued to 
anticipate weak labour market developments, 
particularly in manufacturing and construction.  
According to the European Commission Business and 
Consumer Survey, employmen
t expectations in both 
manufacturing and construction remained broadly 

unchanged in the third quarter of 2003. However,  

expectations were below the average level recorded in 
the first half of the year, thus indicating a deterioration 
in employment prospects. On the other hand, 

employment expectations in the services sector and 
retail trade have been improving modestly since April. 
Although less negative than in other sectors of the 

economy, they are still indicating weak employment 
prospects.  
For the year 2003, employme
nt in the euro area is 
estimated to contract marginally by 0.2% in 2003 and to 
remain flat in the EU as 
a whole, after growing by a 
modest 0.5% in 2002 in both regions. These 
developments are in sharp contrast to the performance 

of the euro area labour market in the second half of the 
1990s. During that period, employment grew at a 
respectable pace of 1.4% on average each year and 
more than 8 million jobs were created.  
In 2003, employment developments are expected to 
differ across Member States. Net job creation is 

anticipated for Greece (1.0%)
, Spain (1.7%), Ireland 
and Italy (0.8%), Luxembourg (1.7%), and, outside the 
euro area, in the UK (0.7%). 
In contrast, employment is 
expected to contract in Belgium and Finland (-0.2%), 
Germany (-1.5%), France (-0.2%), the Netherlands  
(-1.1%), Portugal (-1.0%) and,
 outside the euro area, in 
Denmark (-0.6%) and Sweden (-0.2%).  
The unemployment rate is projected to rise to 8.9% in 
the euro area and to 8.1% in the EU as a whole, about 

0.5 pps higher than in 2002. Within the euro area, the 
unemployment rate is not expected to worsen in Spain 
and should even decline in Greece and Italy, but is 

forecast to remain close to or above the euro area 
average in all these countries.
 Outside the euro area, the 
unemployment rate is projected to remain unchanged in 
the UK.

The economy of the euro area
 Employment growth is expected to remain subdued in 
the first part of 2004 and to show healthier signs of 

improvement in subsequent quarters, as the labour 
market benefits from the strengthening of the recovery. 
Overall, however, labour ma
rket conditions are forecast 
to remain weak also in 2004, because the low overhang 
from the previous year weig
hs on the annual average. 
For the year as a whole, em
ployment is estimated to 
increase by a meagre 0.3% in 
2004 both in 
the euro area and the EU. This would translate into net job creation of 
about 0.3 million new jobs in the euro area (and more 

than 0.5 million new jobs in the EU). As real GDP is 
forecast to grow by 1.8%, the above figures would also 
imply an increase in labour
 productivity of 1.5% vis-à-
vis 0.6% in 2003. 
The weakness of the labour market in 2004 will be 
reflected in the evolution 
of the employment rate. The 
latter, defined as the share of employed persons aged 
15-64 in the total population of the same age group, is 
estimated at 62% in 2003 in the euro area and is 

forecast to remain broadly unchanged in 2004. As a 
consequence of low job creation and a relatively 
stronger increase in labour supply, unemployment is set 
to rise both this year and the next. Total unemployment 
in 2003 is estimated at 12.4 million persons in the euro 

area and about 14.5 million in the EU and is projected 
to increase by about 0.3 million in 2004 in both regions. 
The labour force participation is expected to rise by 

about 0.7 million persons in 
the euro area and almost 
0.9 million in the EU. This translates into a 

deterioration of the unemployment rate, which is 

forecast to rise by 2 pps in
 both regions, to 9.1% and 
8.3%, respectively. 
The projected acceleration of
 economic activity during 
2004 and the continuation of buoyant growth during the 
following year are expected to
 a have beneficial impact 
on the labour market in 2005. Employment is projected 
to increase by 0.8% in both 2005 in the euro area and 

the EU as a whole. At the same time, the more limited 
increase in labour supply from an annual growth rate of 
0.5% in 2004 to 0.7% in 2005 would imply a 
marginally lower unemployment rate, which is 

estimated to decline to 9% in the euro area and 8.1% in 
the EU. The employment rate 
in the euro area should 
rise to 62.5%. 
Within the overall figures, however, there is a wide 
range of labour market performances. Employment 

rates range from high levels in Denmark, the 

Netherlands, Sweden, the UK to very low levels in 
Greece, Spain and Italy. Variations are expected to 
remain wide also in unemployment rates, which are 

forecast to range from around
 4-5% in countries like 
Denmark, Ireland, Austria Luxembourg and the UK to 

around 9-10% in Germany, Gr
eece, Spain, France, Italy 
and Finland.  
Limited progress towards employment rate targets 
Under the Lisbon Agenda (2001), an overall 
employment target of 70% by 2010 was established for 
the European Union, to which an intermediate target of 
67% by 2005 was later added at the Stockholm Spring 
Council in 2001. On the basis of the Autumn 2003 
Commission Forecasts, the em
ployment rate in 2005 would remain below the agreed Stockholm target in the 
European Union. However, significant progress has 
been made in recent years.
 The employment rate rose 
by about 4 pps between 1995 and 2001, from just above 
60% to about 64% in the EU
 and from about 58% to 
62% in the euro area. The employment rate is estimated 
to reach 64.4% in 
the EU and 62.5% in the euro area at 
the end of the forecast period, making further progress 

towards the Stockholm target, despite subdued 

economic activity in
 recent years. 
Although the employment targets are overall and not 

for individual countries, 
the aggregate outcome hides 
the labour market performan
ces in the fifteen Member 
States. Some Member States (Denmark, the 

Netherlands, Austria Portugal
, Finland, Sweden and the 
UK) had employment rates higher than 67% of the 
working population already in 2001 and are expected to 
remain above that threshold also in 2005. Outside this 
group of countries, employment is estimated to have 
increased relatively more st
rongly in Spain, Italy and Luxembourg. Looking in detail at the euro area 
Member States figures, we also
 find that the four largest 
euro-area countries (Germany
, France, Italy and Spain) 
would not reach the Stockholm target by 2005. In 

Germany, the Netherlands, 
Portugal and, outside the 
euro area, in Sweden and 
Denmark, employment should 
contract between 2001 and 2005.

33304978 European Economy 4. Slow improvement of inflation prospects 
 4.1 Recent inflation developments 
Headline inflation underpinned by temporary 
factors in 2003 
Headline inflation in the 
euro area has been on an 
upward trend from mid-2002 to the first quarter of 
2003. The annual rate of inflation peaked at 2.4% in 
March 2003 compared to 1.9% in June of last year, 
mainly reflecting the upward pressure of the energy 

component of consumer prices as well as some base 
effects. Headline inflation 
eased somewhat in July to 
just below the ECB objective of ﬁan inflation rate close 
to 2% over the medium termﬂ but rose again to 2.1% in 
August and September.  
The resilience of headline inflation over the summer 
was driven by a number of temporary factors: the pass-

through of increases in oil prices to the energy 
component of consumer price inflation delayed the 

unwinding that had been exp
ected in Spring; inclement 
weather conditions throughout Europe exerted an 

upward pressure on food prices and some rises in 

indirect taxes also boosted headline inflation. Over the 
coming months, there is also a risk of a further increase 
in unprocessed food prices following the damage to 
crops caused by weather c
onditions during the summer. 
While these factors are underpinning inflation in the 

short run, they are not expected to have a long run 

impact on price developm
ents. Overall, headline 
inflation is projected at 2.1% both in the fourth quarter 

of 2003 and for the year as a whole.  
Modest deceleration of core inflation  
A main feature of inflation developments during the 
second half of last year and the first quarter of 2003 has 
been the divergence between 
headline and core inflation 
(defined as headline inflation excluding the volatile 

components of energy and unprocessed food). Core 

inflation fell from 2.6% in Ju
ne 2002 to about 2% in the 
first quarter of this year. In January, for the first time in 

sixteen months, core inflation was below headline 

inflation. The downward trend in core inflation has 
benefited from a decline in services inflation, which 
diminished to 2.6% in March 2003 compared to 3.2% in 

June 2002. Core inflation eased more modestly in the 
following two quarters. It 
even accelerated slightly between February and April 2003, before declining 
again in the following months to stand at 2% in 
September. Here again, special
 factors, in particular the 
hike in tobacco taxes, contributed to the stickiness of 
core inflation. Excluding the impact of tobacco taxes,

34304978 European EconomyChapter 2 
The economy of the euro area 
  
 
   core inflation was down to 1.8% in September 2003, 
compared to 2.1% in December 2002 and 2.3% one 
year before.  
The decomposition of core inflation into its main 
components - services, non-energy industrial goods and 

processed food Œ reveals that the downward trend is 
driven mainly by inflation 
in services and to a lesser 
extent in manufacturing goods.  
Of particular importance fo
r the deceleration of core 
inflation is the improvement of service inflation, which 
has been one of the most sluggish components of core 
inflation for most of 2002. Since the beginning of 2003, 
services inflation has been declining but the annual rate 

of price increase remains high: inflation in services was 
2.5% in September 2003, dow
n from 3.0% in December 
2002. Since services represen
t almost 40% of the HICP 
basket, a continuation of this declining trend would 

make a significant contribution to an improvement of 
the underlying picture for overall inflation.  
Manufacturing goods inflation is also contributing to 
the decline in core inflation, since strong competition in 

the tradeable goods sector, in an economic environment 
characterised by subdued growth, puts downward 
pressure on profit margins and prices. Manufacturing 

good inflation was only 0.6% in September 2003 and, 
despite a recent up-tick, it has been on a downward 
trend since the beginning of the slowdown. 
In contrast, processed food inflation has remained 
relatively sticky during 2003 as a consequence of the 

pass-through effects of weather-related price spikes for 

fresh food. Processed food inflation was still 3.1% in 
September 2003, not significantly different from one 
year before. 
Two important factors, which prevent a more marked 
decline in core inflation, are sluggish productivity 

growth and the slowness of the pass-through of the 

effect of the appreciation of
 the euro into domestic 
prices. With growth in labour compensation slightly up 

to 2.7% year-on-year and sl
ow productivity gains, the 
first quarter of 2003 has seen an edging upwards of 

growth in unit labour costs by 1.8%, against 1.4% in the 
last quarter of 2002.  As to
 the appreciation of the euro, 
import prices in the second quarter of 2003 were only 
1.6% lower than a year befo
re. Over the same period, 
the euro effective exchange
 rate appreciated by 15% 
(based on quarterly averages). The relatively slow pass-

through of the euro appreciation to domestic prices is 
confirmed by an analysis of monthly import prices for 
manufactured goods. In June 2003, manufactured 

import prices were only 8% lower than a year before. 
Over the same period, the euro effective exchange rate 
had appreciated by 16%. These data suggest that the 

impact of the appreciation of
 the euro on import prices 
has not been fully reflected in domestic prices at this 

juncture.  
4.2 A better inflation outlook in the 
medium term Headline inflation is forecast 
to remain stubbornly high 
in the short-run. It is expect
ed to average 2.0% in 2004, 
easing below that level only in the last quarter of the 

year. The resilience of headline inflation mainly reflects 

sluggish productivity growth, stemming from a mild 
recovery and the pass-through effects of past weather-
related price spikes for food and oil prices.  
Notwithstanding the short-te
rm effects of temporary 
price shocks, the medium term forecasts for price 
developments remain favourable. The inflation rate is 

projected to slow down to 1.7% in 2005.   
Several factors, both domestic and external, are 
expected to provide positive contributions to the 

improved inflation outlook. Th
ese include the fact that 
core inflation is expected to continue to decline, albeit 
at a slow pace, as a result of a sizeable output gap and 
lower imported inflation. At the same time, overall 

economic conditions are expect
ed to be conducive to 
moderate wage developments and an improvement in 

unit labour costs. Headline inflation should benefit from 
more moderate oil price developments, compared to the

  recent past, and from the pos
itive impact of the past 
euro appreciation on domestic prices. On top of this, 
producer and consumer inflation expectations point 
towards declining price trends, despite some short-term 
volatility. 
Growth in the euro area is expected to pick-up in the 
second half of 2003 and to 
strengthen over the forecast 
horizon. However, the level of economic activity is 
forecast to remain well below potential as the output 
gap is estimated at about Œ1.2% of GDP in 2003 and to 

remain approximately unchanged at that level also in 
2005, after having widened to 1.4% in 2004. This 
should keep inflation pressures low. 
Growth in compensation per employee is forecast at 
2.7% this year and at around 2.5% in 2004 and 2005. 

This translates into a decel
eration of wage increases 
over the forecast horizon co
mpared to the recent past. 
These moderate wage developments, combined with 

increasing labour productivity from 0.6% growth in 
2003 to about 1.5% in 2004 and 2005, results in lower 
unit labour cost growth, which is estimated to 

decelerate from 2.1% in 2003 to around 1% in both 
2004 and 2005. Moderate wage growth will also help to 

further dampen services in
flation as wages account for 
a higher share of costs in services than in goods.  
External price pressures are 
also expected to remain 
favorable over the forecast horizon. This reflects the 
projected decline in 
oil prices and the delayed effects of 
the euro appreciation. After falling significantly in the 
aftermath of the Iraq war, oil prices have picked up 
again mainly as a consequence of a number of supply-

side factors (difficulty in restoring Iraq™s oil production, 
political uncertainties in Venezuela and Argentina, 
strike in Nigeria, low stock levels in the USA). 
However, the oil supply is expected to recover next 

year and prices moderate as a result. Oil prices are 
projected to decline from 
an average level of 28.3 
USD/bl. in 2003 to 25.6 USD/bl. next year and to 24.1 

USD/bl. in 2005. This will help to bring down headline 
inflation, although there are always significant 

uncertainties attached to oil price projections. 
The appreciation of the euro is
 also expected to have a 
positive effect on price developments. In 2003 the euro-
dollar exchange rate is assumed to be 1.13 USD/EUR, 

which means a nominal appreciation of more than 20% 
compared to the average 
exchange rate of 0.92 
USD/EUR recorded in the previous three years. The 
euro-dollar exchange rate is assumed to be 1.16 
USD/EUR in 2004 and 1.15 USD/EUR in 2005. The 
nominal effective exchange rate of the euro (against 

main industrialized countri
es and accession countries) 
is estimated to appreciate 
by more than 11% in 2003 
and to remain broadly unchanged at that level in 2004 

and 2005. The effect of 
the euro appreciation is 
expected to reduce import prices this year and to lesser 

extent also in 2004, thereby having a positive effect on 
consumer price inflation particularly in 2004. The euro 
appreciation should also ha
ve an adverse effect on 
exporters™ profit margins as exporters squeeze mark-ups 
to avoid market share losses. Export prices are 
projected to decline by 0.9% in 2003, before recovering 

somewhat in 2004 and increasing by about 1% in 2005. 
Inflation differentials remain wide 
Inflation rates among 
Member States differ 
substantially. In 2004, headline inflation is expected to 
decelerate in most countr
ies but not in Belgium, 
Germany, Greece, Austria and the UK. In the three 
largest economies of the euro area, inflation rates for

The economy of the euro area 
  
 
   2004 range from 1.6% in Germany to 1.8% in France 
and 2.3% in Italy, despite less pronounced growth 
differentials. Inflation forecasts are higher in some 
other Member States, for example 2.8% in Spain, 3.7% 

in Greece, 3.4% in Ireland, partly because of stronger 
current and past growth rates.  
The lowest rate of inflation is forecast for Finland 
(1.0%) and the highest ra
te for Greece (3.7%). Five 
euro-area Member States are expected to have an 

inflation rate above the 2.0% ceiling in 2004: Greece, 
Spain, Ireland, Italy and Po
rtugal (2.2%). In 2005, the 
highest price increases are anticipated again for Greece 
(3.3%), Spain (2.6%), Irel
and (2.8%) and Portugal 
(2.3%). For the remaining countries, including non-euro 

area Member States, an inflation rate of 2.0% or less is 

projected. 37304978 European Economy  5. Public finances: general deterioration with some Member States exceeding the 3% reference valueGeneral government deficits widen  
For 2003, the general governm
ent balance is expected 
to reach a deficit of 2.8% 
of GDP in the euro area, 
compared to 2.2% in 2002. This will be the highest 
deficit for the euro area sinc
e 1996, when the recorded 
deficit was 4.3% of GDP. In 2003, among the fifteen 
Member States, only five countries will have general 
government positions of close to balance or in surplus. 

These are Belgium, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and 
Spain. In the forecast year
s, no other country in the 
European Union, is expect
ed to join this group, 
according to the Autumn fo
recasts. The expected 
deficits in two euro area countries, namely Germany 
and France, will exceed 3% 
of GDP in 2003, while 
Portugal is set to join this group in 2004.  
This situation implies an upward revision compared to a 
deficit forecast of 2.5% of 
GDP for the euro area in the 
Commission Spring Forecasts. The revisions in the 
general government positions are particularly important 
in the case of the Netherlands (up by one percentage 
point), Germany (0.8 pps) and France (0.5 pps).  The 

main downward revision to the deficit concerns 
Portugal, for which the deficit is projected to represent 
2.9% of GDP, compared to 3.5% of GDP in the Spring 

forecast.  In 2004, a slight improvement
 is expected for the euro 
area, with the general government deficit falling 
marginally to 2.7% of GDP. In 2005, the deficit of the 
euro area is expected to rema
in stable in terms of GDP. 
This is mainly a result of the expected acceleration in 
GDP growth, since the forecast for 2005 is carried out 
on the basis of a « no-policy change » assumption.  
Composition of government accounts 
 Total revenues as a percent of GDP are expected to 
decrease in the euro area ov
er the forecast period. From 
46.1% of GDP in 2002, revenu
es are forecast to remain 
broadly unchanged in 2003, before decreasing to 45.7% 

of GDP and 45.4% of GDP in 2004 and 2005, 
respectively. This is a ge
neralised movement across 
Member States.  
Total expenditure of the general government is 
expected to increase from 48.3% of GDP in 2002 to 
49% of GDP in 2003. This is partially due to higher 
unemployment-related expenditure, as the slowdown in 
economic activity is leadin
g to a rising unemployment 
rate. In 2004 and 2005, total expenditure is expected to 
decline somewhat in terms 
of GDP, reaching 48.4% and 
48%, respectively, in these two years. 
Over the forecast period, budget balances will benefit 
from slightly lower intere
st expenditure. Interest 
spending will fall from 3.6% of GDP in 2003 to 3.4% 
of GDP in both 2004 and 2005 in the euro area. Interest 
expenditure makes a slightly positive contribution to the 
change in actual balances during the forecast years.

The economy of the euro area
 The effect of the cycle and policy reactions 
For the euro area as a whole,
 the economic slowdown is 
the main factor responsible for the deterioration of 
public finances in 2003.  However, in some Member 
States, there have been slip
pages in budgetary policies. 
The change in the actual ba
lance for the euro area in 
2003 shows a deterioration of 0.6 of a percentage point 

of GDP, compared to 2002. The cyclical component 

accounts for 0.7 of a percen
tage point. In 2004, the 
contribution of the cycle to
 the expected marginal 
improvement in the actual ba
lance is again negative but 
only by 0.1 of a percentage point.  In 2004, since actual 
output may grow at a rate very close to potential, the 
cyclical effect on the budget
 balance should be neutral. 
Budgetary policy 
in the euro area remained broadly 
neutral in 2003, as measured by the change in the 

cyclically adjusted prim
ary balance (CAPB), which 
reached 1.2% of GDP, compared to 1.3% of GDP in 
2002. However, there are considerable differences at 
the country level. The overall budgetary stance in the 

euro area is expected to be broadly unchanged next 
year.  The debt situation  
Several Member States are experiencing an increase in 
their debt to GDP ratio. Consequently, for the euro area 

as a whole, the debt ratio is expected to increase in 
2003 for the first time in ma
ny years, when it will reach 
70.4% of GDP. This is mainly the result of increases in 
the debt ratio in three co
untries: France, where the 
increase compared to 2002
 is approximately four percentage points, bringing the ratio to 62.6% of GDP; 
Germany, where the debt to GDP ratio climbs to 63.8% 
(up by 3 percentage points); the Netherlands (up by 2.2 

pps; debt/GDP at 54.6%). 
In 2003, all three high debt countries, namely Belgium, 
Greece and Italy, will continue with debt/GDP ratios 

above 100% for one more year, although the ratios will 
be on a declining path. In 2004, the debt to GDP ratio is 
expected to decline furthe
r in Greece and Belgium, 
falling below 100% for the first time since the early 
1990™s in Greece. In Belgium, the debt ratio is projected 
to fall below this mark in 2005 for the first time in two 

decades. On the other hand, th
e Italian debt situation is 
expected to remain broadly unchanged in 2004-2005, 

leaving the debt/GDP ratio at approximately 106%.  
Excessive deficits in France and Germany in 2003 
and risks in other countries Like most other countries in the euro area, these two 
countries entered EMU with relatively high deficits, but 
they have failed to make progress towards the medium-
term objective of close-to-b
alance or in surplus, in 
particular during periods of
 strong expansion. Recent 
experience shows that the budgetary situation can 

deteriorate suddenly, raising the question of how to 
adjust in a situation of an unexpected downturn in 
economic activity or protra
cted sluggish growth. The 
deficit rose above 3% of GDP in Portugal in 2001, and 
above this reference value 
in France and Germany in 
2002. In 2003, increased deficits are projected for

 France and Germany, exceeding the 3% level by a large 
margin.   
Among the high deficit countries, based on information 
available in late October, only France is expected to 

make a structural effort of at least 0.5% of GDP in 
2004, although the cyclically adjusted deficit is forecast 
to remain high next year at 3.3% of GDP.   
In Germany, the deficit for 
2003 is expected to reach 
4.2% of GDP, with only a marginal decline to 3.9% in 
2004. This is, however, in 
the absence of any measures 
that may be taken in accordance to the 2004 budget, 
which is still under discussion and will be adopted only 
in December or even later. The cyclically-adjusted 

deficit is expected to increase by 0.1 pps in 2003. 
Between 2003 and 2004, the cyclically adjusted deficit 
will decline by 0.2 pps, 
reaching 3.3% of GDP, 
according to the forecasts. 
In Portugal, the deficit is expected to increase to 2.9% 
of GDP in 2003, compared to 2.7% of GDP in 2002. 

However, this is the result of large one-off operations, 
which compensate for the heavy loss in revenues due to 
the significant slowdown.  The forecast deficit is 
expected to increase in the 
following years to above the 
3% reference value, at 3.3% of GDP and 3.9% of GDP 
in 2004 and 2005 respectively.  
Besides the three countries currently in excessive 
deficit, the budgetary situation is showing worrying 

signs of deterioration also in  other euro area  countries, 
notably Italy, Greece and the 
Netherlands. In Italy, 
despite large one-off measures, the deficit is expected to 

reach 2.6% of GDP in 2003. Furthermore, the reduction 
in the debt to GDP ratio seems to have stalled 
somewhat, with the debt ratio falling slightly to 106.4% 

of GDP in 2003. 
In Greece, the deficit is set to widen by half a 
percentage point in 2003 reaching 1.7% of GDP, while 

a significant deterioration is expected in 2004, bringing 
the deficit to 2.4% of GDP. More importantly, the 
Greek deficit is widening in
 cyclically adjusted terms 
by 0.7 pps in 2003 and 0.9 pps in 2004, and is projected 
to remain close to the actual deficit.  
In the Netherlands, the deterioration in the general 
government balances has been rapid. From a 
comfortable surplus of 2.2% of GDP in 2000, a deficit 
of 1.6% of GDP was recorded in 2002, while the 

expected deficit for the curr
ent year is estimated at 
2.6% of GDP. This development reflects, to a certain 

extent, the operation of automatic stabilisers in the 

context of a sudden weakening of economic activity. In 
2004, the deficit may reach 2.
7% of GDP. However, in 
cyclically-adjusted terms, the Dutch deficit is estimated 

to have declined by about 3/4 of a percentage point in 
2003 and its cyclically-adjusted balance (CAB) is 

expected to decline by 0.6 pps in 2004, reflecting the 
strong adjustment measures enacted by the new 
government. 
 40304978 European EconomyChapter 3 Member States 304978 European Economy304978 European Economy1. Belgium  Little hard evidence of economic recovery  Economic situation  
 Although weak, a recovery seemed to be on its way in 

Belgium in 2002, but in the fourth quarter real GDP 
growth began to slow down and in the second quarter 
2003 it became negative. A tentative recovery is 

assumed to begin in the second half of 2003, which is 
expected to strengthen in 2004 and 2005. The 
assumption of a recovery has some support from latest 

developments in the business and consumer surveys in 
Belgium, alongside the signs for the global economy, 
though less from hard data. In this scenario, compared 
to the Spring forecasts, real GDP growth has been 
revised downwards from 1.2% to 0.8% in 2003 and 

from 2.3% to 1.8% in 2004. 
 GDP components 
 In 2002, both gross fixed investment and net exports 
contributed negatively to growth, whereas private and 

public consumption offered small but positive 
contributions. 
 
In 2003, real GDP is driven entirely by domestic 
demand, as external demand will remain weak for some 
time. Due to subdued external demand and the 

appreciation of the euro, the first quarter reported a 
decrease  in exports by 1.8% quarter on quarter; exports 

continued to decrease in the second quarter but not that 

sharply. Real disposable income of households is 
expected to increase slightly less in 2003 than in 2002. 
However, private consumption was very strong in the 
first two quarters and some positive signals from the 
consumer survey during th
e summer support the view 
that private consumption might be stronger on yearly 
average in 2003 than 
in 2002. Unless private 
consumption falls considerably in the second half of 

2003, this should result in a notable decline in 

households™ savings rate. Private investment was weak 
in the first half of 2003 and taking into account subdued 
external demand and a high rate of capacity utilisation, 

investment is expected to remain weak for the rest of  
the year.   Activity in the coming two years is projected to be also 
driven by external demand. 
Following the recovery in 
neighbouring countries, exports should start to increase 
in Belgium, despite the appreciation of the euro. 
Imports are closely linked to exports in Belgium, and 

the contribution from net exports will therefore be 
moderate.  
 
The decline in the households™ savings rate in 2003 
seems somewhat unwarranted in the light of the labour 
market situation; the decline is assumed to slow down 

in 2004, consistent with pr
ivate consumption increasing 
at about the same pace as in
 2003. In 2005
, the increase 
in disposable income will 
decelerate somewhat, but the 
overall improved economic situation might result in 
further reduction in the households™ saving rate and 
private consumption should
 then accelerate again. 
 Labour market 
 A downward trend has characterised employment since 
mid 2001 and the unemployment rate has risen from 

6½% to about 8% in mid 2003. However, during the 
last months, the unemployment rate has been relatively 
stable, which might indicate a turning point. Although 

not a fully reliable indicator, but in line with the 
developments in the unemployment rate, the number of 
job offers indicates a possible forthcoming increase in 

employment. Given this and a slow upturn in economic 
activity, employment is foreseen to rise in the second 
half of 2003. Employment is then expected to 

strengthen further in 2004 and 2005 as a result of 
economic growth and the gov
ernment™s commitment to 
support job creation. However, growth in employment 
will not be immediately translated into a lower 
unemployment rate. After a 1 percentage point of 
increase in 2003, the unemployment rate is calculated to 

stabilise in 2004. Its decline in 2005 is foreseen to be 
slow. Graph 3.1:

, Belgium  Wages and inflation 
 In January 2003, a two-year wage agreement for the 

private sector was signed, fixing a norm of total wage 
increases to 5.4%. An increase of about 2% is expected 
to materialise in 2003, followed by some 3% in 2004. 

Wage negotiations for 2005 will be influenced by the 
likely improvement in the employment situation and by 
reductions in the social security contributions, but the 

still high unemployment rate might entail some 
moderation. Wages are therefore expected to increase at 
about the same rate in 2005 as in 2004. Moderate wage 
increases, reduced social security contributions and 
lower oil prices will allow inflation to remain between 

1½ and 2% during the forecast period. 
Public finances
 Belgium reached government 
surpluses in 2000 and 
2001 and a budget close to balance in 2002. The budget 
is expected to turn into a small surplus again in 2003, 
despite a deteriorating economic environment. 

However, the surplus is due to a one-off operation: the 
transfer of the Belgacom pension fund to the 
government. This operation, approximately 1.4% of 

GDP in 2003 and 0.5% of GDP in 2004, has been 
treated as deficit-reducing. Eurostat is investigating 

whether this accounting treatment is appropriate and 
whether this operation is covered by their decision of 21 
October 2003 on lump-sum payments in relation to 

unfunded pension schemes. Hence the treatment as 
deficit reducing is of purely technical nature not 
prejudging in any way the final outcome of the 

investigation by Eurostat. 
The government balance is 
expected to turn into a 
deficit in 2004 and 2005. However, this does not reflect 
a deterioration of the 
government balance when 
excluding the Belgacom oper
ation: the underlying 
deficit tends to decline under the influence of low 

interest rates and an improvement of the business cycle. 
The cyclically adjusted primary surplus is projected to 
be reduced from 5.3% of GDP in 2003, to 4.5% of GDP 
in 2005. Government gross debt is foreseen to decrease 
continuously as a percentage of GDP but not fall below 

100% until 2005.

 44304978 European Economy2. Denmark  Out of a relatively mild downturn 
 The economy in 2003 
 Denmark's economic growth has been rather subdued so 

far in 2003. In the first half of the year, economic 
activity weakened, in particular domestic demand. A 
slight GDP growth in the first quarter was held up 

largely by stockbuilding, while private consumption 
was negatively affected by a sharp decline in car sales. 
In the second quarter, GDP contracted by 0.6%, mainly 

due to a steep fall in investments, in particular 
equipment. All in all, the positive contribution from net 
exports could not compensate for the weak domestic 
demand in the first half of the year. 
 Prospects 
 With industry confidence 
indicators pointing upwards 
and with signs of recovery in retail sales and new car 
registrations, domestic demand should pick up in the 
second half of 2003. On top of a positive growth 

contribution from net exports, the recovery of domestic 
demand should provide for a GDP growth of 0.8% in 
2003. In 2004 and 2005, GDP growth is expected to 

accelerate to 2% and 2¼%, re
spectively, with growth predominantly driven by domestic demand. 

 
On the whole, Denmark's economy remains sound. 
Both public finances and the current account feature 
healthy surpluses 
throughout the forecast period. 
    GDP components 
 Private consumption is exp
ected to pick up in the 
second half of 2003, on the back of improved prospects 
and increased confidence. Car sales should rebound 
after the pronounced fall in the first part of the year. In 

2004, in particular, private consumption should be 
boosted further by a solid growth in real disposable 
incomes, held up by the income tax cuts as well as by 

lower inflation. Investments should recover in the 
second half of the year, albeit falling over the year as a 
whole. Against the backgrou
nd of increased overall 
demand, investment growth should then gather strength 

gradually in 2004 and 2005.  

 Exports have been resilient, in spite of the appreciation 
of the 
krone 
and relatively high wage increases. The 
benign export developments seem in part to have been 
due to the favourable composition of Danish export 
goods, which makes exports less affected by the 

economic cycle. As global ma
rkets are set to expand in 
the forecast period, Denmark's exports are consequently 

foreseen to grow less than its export markets, resulting 

in a loss of market shares. 
Danish exports of goods are 
thus expected to grow by 2¾% in 2003, increasing to 

4% in 2004 and to some 4¾% in 2005. Imports are 

foreseen to expand at somewhat higher rates, implying, 
respectively, a slightly negative and neutral contribution 
to GDP growth from net expo
rts in the latter two years. 
 Costs and prices 
 The inflation rate has come down in the first part of  
2003 with falling energy prices. As from October 2003, 

excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and soft drinks have 
been reduced. The effects - a 
reduction of the inflation 
rate by ¼ percentage point - will mainly show up in 
2004. In the forecast period, in
flation is set to continue 
at rates just below 2%, as a result of less inflationary 

pressure from labour and pr
oduct markets, increasing 
marginally only at the end of the period. 
 Labour market  
 As the expansion of economic activity is established in 
2004, net job creation is set to increase again after a fall 

in employment  in  2003.   The  unemployment  rate  is

, Denmark  expected to rise through 2003, peaking at 6% of the 
labour force, and to fall gradually in the rest of the 
period. Wage growth has 
decelerated somewhat in 2003and should remain around 3½% in 2004 and 2005. 
 Public finances
   The general government balance recorded a surplus of 
about 2% of GDP in 2002. The expected modest GDP 

growth in 2003 will entail lower tax revenues and 
higher unemployment transfers to households, reducing  
the surplus to 0.9% of GDP. In 2004, the surplus is set 

to rise to 1.3% of GDP, due to effects of the increased 
GDP growth and to the fact that the pension fund yield 

tax should generate considerably more revenues. 
However, the increase in the surplus is limited by a 
reduction of income taxes corresponding to 0.4% of 

GDP, as part of the tax reform. In 2005, a general 
government surplus of 1.9% of GDP is foreseen. 
 
The public debt, which stood at 45½% of GDP at the 
end of 2002, is set to fall below 40% of GDP by 2005.

46304978 European Economy3. Germany  From shallow recession to slow recovery 
  The economy in 2003  
 During the first half of 2003, the German economy 
could not overcome the three-year stagnation, which 
started in the middle of 2000. Indeed, the country fell 

into a shallow recession with
 the economy contracting 
by 0.2 % and 0.1%, respectively, in the first two 

quarters of 2003. Exports, traditionally an important 

source of growth in Germany, declined during the first 
half of the year. Imports, by contrast, held up fairly 
well, partly as a technical
 correction of the slump 
observed in 2002. As a consequence, the external 
contribution to growth turned strongly negative. 
 Rising imports are also a sign of strengthening domestic 
demand. Thus, private and government consumption 

were heading up in both the first and the second quarter. 
Nevertheless, equipment investment continued to be 
weak, and construction declined, despite a recent 

upward blip. 
 In the second half of 2003, domestic demand is set to 

continue growing at a slow pace, as recently rising 
order and output volumes suggest. Together with 

brightening export prospects, GDP growth should 

therefore become slightly positive. For the year as a 
whole, growth is expected to be zero. Stagnation in 
2003 exacerbated the proble
ms on the labour market, 
with a projected annual fa
ll in employment by 1½ % 
compared with 2002. In parallel, annual average 

unemployment rose strongly.  
 Prospects 
 On the back of industrial and consumer confidence 

heading up, a gradual recovery should take hold over 
the next two years, with growth edging up from a 
quarterly rate of some ¼ % in the beginning of 2004 to 

around ½ % in 2005. A stronger acceleration is held 
back by a number of dampening factors. First, 
unemployment is high and will continue to rise until 

early 2005, holding back private consumption. Second, 
efforts at all levels of gov
ernment to contain budget 
deficits will keep any growth impulse from the public 
sector small. Third, potential output is held back by the 
low level of investment over the last few years. In 

addition, following the protracted stagnation, many 
companies may still need to consolidate their balance 
sheets before engaging in capacity-enlarging 

investments. Also, credit 
constraints are likely to 
continue to be a limiting factor for new investment, 

even though recent figure
s indicate that commercial 
lending has picked up mildly. Finally, it cannot be 
excluded that, like in 2002, the pick-up in business 
sentiment only marks an expectations bubble that is not 
followed by an improvement in the actual business 
situation. Companies might therefore take a wait-and-
see attitude.  

 These constraints will ease only gradually. Growth in 
2004 is therefore projected 
at a modest 1.6%, about one 
third of which is simply the result of an unusually large 
calendar effect; the year has a leap day (29 February) 
and several holidays falling on a weekend. By contrast, 
a reversal of the calendar effect will reduce growth for 
2005 by ¼ pp; it is estimated to be 1¾ %. These growth 

figures imply a significant narrowing of the output gap, 
since potential growth is estimated at only 1.3% 
annually. 
 In particular in the light of the Hartz labour market 
reform, which has already led to the creation of a 

sizeable number of mini-jobs, employment will start 
picking up, despite the re
latively moderate pace of 
growth. Due to the statistical overhang, however, the 
average level for 2004 will still remain below that of 
2003. A genuine relief will only be felt by 2005.  
 
Wage and price developments will remain moderate 
throughout the forecast period, thereby improving 
Germany™s competitiveness vis-à-vis its European 

trading partners. Nevertheless, CPI inflation will 
temporarily notch up in 2004 as a result of the increase

 Public finances  
 The general government deficit is expected to rise to 
4.2% of GDP in 2003. Of the shortfall of over twenty 
billion euro compared with budget plans, around two-
thirds can be attributed to unemployment-related 

expenditures, while the remaining one-third is a result 
of disappointing tax revenues and social security 
contributions.  
 Budget projections for the coming two years are 

complicated by a large number of government 
proposals that require approval by the  second chamber  
of parliament (
Bundesrat
).  In the light of the high 
uncertainty, the 2004 budget fo
recast of 3.9% of GDP is  
therefore based on the no-policy change assumption. It 
does not incorporate some additional •12 billion (0.6% 
of GDP) of net consolidation effort announced by the 

government. Even if that amount were included, 
Germany would be at least ¼ pp above the 3% of GDP 
deficit ceiling.  

 Similarly, the projection of a 3.4% of GDP deficit for 
2005, takes only half of the envisaged consolidation 

measures on board. A full implementation of the 
announced proposals would reduce the projected deficit 
by a further •10 billion (0.5% of GDP). In this case, the 
deficit would fall below 3% of GDP.  
 
Based on the projected deficit, the debt level, which 
stood at 60.8% of GDP in 2002
 is expected to rise to over 63 % by the end of 2003 and reach close to 66% 
by the end of 2005.

 Increasing fiscal imbalances despite strong growth
  The economy in 2003  
 Economic activity continued to grow at a strong pace 
supported by domestic demand. Private consumption 
remained buoyant underpinned by high wage increases 
and tax reductions implemented by the recent tax 

reform. Investment spending linked to the accelerating 
preparations for the Olympics along with the financial 
flows from the EU Structural Funds contributed to 

increasing investment at a rate
 higher than the real GDP 
growth rate. The external transactions deficit remained 

high as exports of tourist services stagnated due to weak 
foreign demand and geopolitical uncertainties, whereas 
the buoyant domestic demand led to a slight pick up in 

imports of goods.  
The labour market showed a significant improvement 
over the year, the unemployment rate dropping to 8.9% 

in the second quarter from
 9.6% a year ago. Total 
employment is estimated to rise by 1% in 2003 and the 

unemployment rate to stand at 9.5%, remaining among 

the highest in the EU and euro area. Despite this 
improvement, which is to a great extent linked to the 
booming construction activity, the persisting high 

unemployment rates of young workers and females 
indicate that the remaining considerable rigidities in the 
labour market are not being 
eliminated at a satisfactory 
pace. The two-year wage 
agreement in the private 
sector, signed in early 2002, 
provided for an increase of 
4.2% in minimum nominal wage in 2003. On average, 

nominal wages are estimated to increase by 6.5%. 
 Weather-related increases in unprocessed food prices as 
well as high energy prices contributed to the 
acceleration of inflation in th
e first half of the year. 
Price pressures eased tempor
arily late in Summer but 
remained above 3% due main
ly to the considerable 
increase in service prices. 
Thus, with core inflation 
stubbornly standing at 3.2%, the headline rate is 
estimated to increase by 3.
6% in yearly average.  
 Prospects in 2004 and 2005 
 Strong growth of real GDP is
 expected to continue in 2004 while a deceleration 
in economic activity is 
projected for 2005. Private consumption, buttressed by 
generous wage increases and easy monetary conditions 
will continue to increase rapidly; investment spending 

on projects linked to the Olympics is projected to 
remain the main driver of real GDP growth. As 
investment spending is likely to sharply retreat after the 

completion of the construction projects related to the 
Olympics, a deceleration in economic activity is 
expected in 2005. However, the expected improvement 

in the international environment from 2004 and low 
interest rates may help in keeping domestic activity 
relatively buoyant in the period after the end of the 

Olympics. The international economic recovery might 
help in reducing the external
 sector deficit provided that 
the necessary measures are taken to ward off a further 
deterioration in the international competitiveness of the 
Greek economy. In 2004, real GDP is projected to rise 
by 4.2% remaining above potential, but it is expected to 

decelerate to 3.4% in 2
005 as investment in 
construction activities will wane and the fiscal stimulus 

to the economy will be weakened.  
 The external transactions deficit is expected to slightly 

improve as imports of goods and services will rise 
moderately and exports, in particular services exports, 
are expected to considerably increase due to the 

Olympics and the international economic recovery. 
However, the external sector deficit will continue to be 
large throughout the forecasting period, reflecting 

domestic macroeconomic imbalances and loss of 
competitiveness. 
 Costs and prices 
 Consumer price inflation is projected to remain high 

standing at 3.7% in 2004 and slightly decelerating to 
3.4% in 2005; while the contribution of imported 
inflation to consumer price inflation should be small, 

developments concerning wages in the private sector 
are quite uncertain; the new collective negotiations,

, Greece
  expected to start early next 
year, are very likely to be 
influenced by the electoral cycle and the announced 
generous increases in public wages. The assumed 

increase in the minimum nominal wages in the private 
sector by 10% in the 2004-2005 period may turn out to 
be conservative, the upside risks thus being 

significantly increased. Unit labour costs in the whole 
economy are expected to ac
celerate to 3.5% in 2004 
and to  increase by 2.5% in 2005.  
 Public finances 
 The State budget for 2003 and the 2002 updated 
stability programme targeted a deficit for the State 

Budget consistent with a deficit of 0.9% of GDP for the 
general government. However, the general government 
deficit is currently estimated by the Greek authorities to 

stand at 1.4% of GDP in 2003. The latest available data 
on budgetary implementation 
show significant overruns 
in primary spending, implying that the risks of a 
substantial deterioration in the Greek public finances 
are high. The budgetary stra
tegy adopted by the 2002 
update of the stability programme implied a budgetary 
adjustment resting heavily on the assumption of a 

significant improvement in
 the central government 
balances which was expected to result mainly from 
holding back primary spending. However, risks of 
missing the target for the in
crease in primary spending 
are very high. In fact, further rise in general government 
deficit is to be expected in 2004, due to the increase in 
the wage bill and social measures. 
Thus, the general government deficit is estimated to 
stand at 1.7% of GDP in 2003, rise to 2.4% of GDP in 
2004 and slightly fall to 2.3% of GDP in 2005. Primary 
surplus is projected to decline from 4.3% of GDP in 
2003 to 3.1% of GDP in 2005. Consequently, the 
cyclically adjusted balance is estimated to reach Œ2.2% 
of GDP in 2003 and Œ3.1% of GDP in 2004. In spite of 
the large budget deficit, the debt ratio is estimated to 
stand at 100.6% of GDP in
 2003 and decrease to 95% 
of GDP in 2005 mainly due to the contribution of 
nominal GDP growth.

50304978 European Economy5 Spain  Growth still robust    
Following 2.0% growth in 2002, the economy is 
envisaged to gain some momentum and grow by 2.3% 
in 2003 (0.3 percentage points higher than in the last 

Spring Commission forecast). On the back of a 
recovery in investment and exports, growth is expected 
to pick up further in 2004 and exceed potential in 2005. 

The economy would thus continue to outperform the 
euro area as a whole throughout the period. 
 Economic activity in 2003 
 Relatively good employment performance and the 
personal income tax reform, in force from 2003, are 
fuelling private consumption, while private investment 

in equipment,  after having weakened sharply in 2002, 
is currently improving. Conversely, given the strength 
of construction in recent year
s and the brisk increase in 
housing prices, a moderation of this component is 
expected. Altogether, these factors are foreseen to 
increase the contribution of domestic demand to GDP 

growth even further. On the other hand, while exports 
are expected to gain some 
strength, imports are set to 
accelerate in response to expanding final demand. All in 
all, the negative external contribution to GDP growth is 
foreseen to widen, offsetting to some extent the 
contribution of domestic demand. 

 Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
 In 2004 private consumption growth is expected to 
remain broadly stable. The gains in disposable income 
stemming from the reform of the personal income tax 
and continuing sound employment growth are expected 
to result in a rise in the saving ratio, serving to restore 
the financial position of households. These trends are 
foreseen to continue in 2005, with private consumption 
growing by some 3½%.  

 Investment is expected to gain strength in 2004, 
stemming mainly from higher equipment investment as 

a result of improved business prospects, while 
construction is set to decelerat
e only slightly. All in all, gross fixed capital formati
on should accelerate in 2004 and 2005, with equipment investment being the most 

dynamic component . 
  Exports and  imports are set 
to accelerate already in the 
first half of 2004, gaining further strength along the 
forecast period. On balance, the negative external 
contribution to GDP growth ought to narrow only 
marginally.  
 Labour market 
 After a modest pick up, full-time equivalent 
employment is expected to grow at around 2% annually 
until the end of the forecast period on the back of the 

acceleration in activity. As a result, the unemployment 
rate in 2003 is expected to remain broadly stable and 
fall to around 10½% (Eurostat 
definition) by the end of 
2005. The activity rate is foreseen to rise by two 
percentage points over the period. 
 Costs and prices 
 Inflation has been moderating since the start of 2003, 
with both headline and core HICP inflation rates 
expected to average close to 3.0%.  

 For 2004, HICP inflation is expected to fall below 3%, 
easing further to slightly above 2½% in 2005, provided 

wage moderation continues. Employee compensation 
per head in 2004 is foreseen to decelerate in spite of a 
stronger labour market than in 2003, along with rising 

labour productivity growth. Thus, growth of unit labour 
costs should continue to ease.
 These trends are expected 
to extend into 2005, with the rise in compensation per 
employee and unit labour costs moderating further. 
External sector  
The current account deficit is envisaged to widen 
slightly through the forecast period, reflecting a 
deterioration in both the trade and primary incomes and 
current transfers balances.

  -Public finances  
Despite tax cuts introduced by the 2003 reform of the 
personal income tax, revenues are buoyant as a result of 
the relatively robust employment growth. 

Consequently, even with a less optimistic scenario than 
that envisaged by the authorities in the budget, the 
balanced budget target seems within reach. 

Nevertheless, this forecast is still subject to a certain 
degree of uncertainty, give
n the transfer of major 
spending powers to regional governments. 
 
The main spending guidelines are left unchanged in the 
budget for 2004, while re
venues are expected to 
accelerate following the grow
th in economic activity 
and employment creation. Thus, a slight surplus of 

0.1% of GDP is forecast. Assuming no policy changes, 

the general government is foreseen to record again a 
slight surplus in 2005, while the debt-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to remain on a declining path and fall below 

50% of GDP already in 2004.

52304978 European Economy6. France  Fiscal consolidation to start in 2004  The situation in 2003  
The deceleration in real GD
P growth observed in the 
second half of 2002 continued in the first half of 2003: 
after increasing by 0.1% in Q1-03, activity recorded its 

largest quarterly decline in
 seven years in the second 
quarter of 2003, with a fall in real GDP by 0.3%. The 

fall in activity in the second quarter of 2003 was 

however amplified by exceptional factors, such as the 
war in Iraq and the strikes related to the negotiation of 
the pension reform, and was therefore not fully 

representative of underlying growth trends. 
Several elements currently point to a relatively weak, 
but positive, economic growth over the next few 

quarters. Indeed, business surveys in the manufacturing 
industry have bottomed out in the last three months and 
in the service sector latest 
surveys show clear signs of 
improvement. Growth in the 
third quarter of the year 
should also benefit from a favourable technical rebound 

due to the fact that the temporary negative shocks 

mentioned above have disappeared. Despite these 
tangible signs of improvement in cyclical conditions, a 
sharp and sustained recovery seems unlikely in the 

short term, since the current low level of profit margins 
and the subsistence of cash 
problems in companies are 
expected to weigh on firms™ demand. 
Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
By the beginning of 2004, recovery in the world 
economy and relatively favourable monetary conditions 
will contribute to the improvement in demand prospects 
and are expected to trigger a gradual acceleration in 

economic activity. Real GDP growth would then 
resume to a rate close to potential from the beginning of  
2004, and accelerate gradually
 in the course of next 
year and in 2005. 
The acceleration in exports 
volumes from the Autumn 
2003 should support an upturn in demand expectations, 
and create the conditions for firms to slow de-stocking. 
After two years of decline, productive investment is 

projected to gradually recover from next Spring, when 
the improvement in demand slackens current cash 
difficulties faced by firms. 
The materialisation of a steady recovery in private 
consumption should also be gradual. Indeed, 
households™ real gross disposable income is currently 

decelerating mainly due 
to the slowdown in 
employment growth. Moreover, the increase in the 

unemployment rate, expected to continue until next 

Spring, could negatively impact consumers™ confidence 
and trigger an increase in 
precautionary savings.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The deterioration in economic conditions is impacting 
the labour market: employment growth was negative in 

the first half of 2003, and 
is not expected to accelerate 
significantly before next Spring, when it should remain 

relatively modest due to the necessity for companies to 

restore margins. In such a 
context, wage moderation is 
expected to continue in 200
4, when the impact of the 
harmonisation of the different levels of the minimum 

wage created by the working time reduction laws will 
be counterbalanced by a cycl
ical deceleration in wages, 
and in 2005. 
As a consequence of the moderation in unit labour costs 
expected for the next two years, underlying inflationary 
pressures are projected to decrease gradually over the 

time-span covered by the forecast. The decline in 
overall inflation will however be slowed by the 
implementation of significant increases in indirect taxes 

(oil, tobacco) by the end of 2003 and in 2004. 
Public finances 
In 2003, the situation of French public finances 
deteriorated markedly, the general government deficit 
being now expected to reach 4.2% of GDP. This new 

estimate is 0.5 percentage point of GDP higher than 
expected by the Commission in the Spring, and 0.2 
percentage point of GDP higher than the official 

government projection. Worsening in the 2003 
government deficit compared to the Spring forecast 
reflects the impact of the large downward revision to 
the real GDP growth projection for 2003 (by 1 
percentage point). The Commission forecast for 2003

 makes the assumption that expenditures will be kept in 
line with plans in the State sector, and that no further 
slippage will occur in health spending. The general 

government debt is projected to increase from 59.0% of 
GDP in 2002 to 62.6% of GDP in 2003, also due to the 
impact of the subscription by the State to the 

recapitalisation of France Telecom worth 0.6 
percentage point of GDP. 
This is the only financial 
transaction impacting on the de
bt ratio in this forecast.  
In 2004, despite a projected improvement in the 
cyclically-adjusted balance by more than 0.5 percentage 
point of GDP, the general government deficit is 
projected to decline only slightly below 4% of GDP, at  
3.8% of GDP. The decline in the deficit will be 
burdened next year by the lagged impact on fiscal 

revenues of the low 2003 real GDP growth. It is 
assumed in this forecast that expenditure plans included 
in the Finance Law for 2004 will be respected (real 

general government expenditures are projected to 
increase  by  0.9%  next  year),
  i.e.  expenditures of  the  
State sector will remain constant in real terms 

(budgetary accounting) and that measures  taken to curb 
the dynamics of health expenditures have the expected 

impact. Finally, the forecast in
corporates an increase in local taxes by 0.1 percentage point of GDP on the basis 

of recent trends, even if 
the 2004 budgets of local 
authorities are still not unveiled. A number of risks 
exist for the budget
ary execution in 2004, the main one 
being that the measures ai
med at curbing the dynamic 
of spending in the health sector could prove 

insufficient.  In 2005, despite real GDP growth being close to 
potential, the general government deficit is projected to 
decrease only marginally 
to 3.6% of GDP. This 
projection is based on the assumption that real 
government expenditures will increase by about 2% in 
real terms, equal to the trend in real expenditures 

observed in the last 5 to 10 years, compared with a 
projection of 1% in the latest multi-annual projection of 
the French authorities.

y.54304978 European Economy7. Ireland  A broad-based recovery taking hold   Activity in 2003 
 According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP 

expanded by a mere 0.5% on the year in the first quarter 
of 2003, after 7.5% in the previous quarter. Domestic 
demand was quite subdued as relatively healthy 

consumption growth and construction activity were 
offset by a pronounced fall in equipment investment, 
which partly reflected base ef
fects (aircraft purchases in 
2002Q1). On the 
external side, both exports and 
imports fell dramatically on the year (more than 10% in 

volume terms), but this must also be qualified: 2003 
merchandise trade developments are distorted by a very 
marked fall-off in trade reco
rded with the UK, which is 
believed to be related to th
e termination of UK-based 
VAT fraud schemes in the course of 2002. Partial 

indicators for the second qua
rter are mixed, combining 
stagnant retail sales and weak industrial output growth 
with a recovery of exports. As regards the rest of the 
year, the indications from the latest purchasing 

managers' indices for manufacturing and services are 
encouraging, with both 
indices recovering from a 
trough in the second quarte
r. Confidence indicators also 
generally point to an improvement in recent months. 

 For the year as a whole, real
 GDP growth is expected to 
reach 1½%, an apparently dr
amatic slowing from 6.9% 
in 2002. However, almost two-thirds of the latter figure 

can be attributed to the chemicals and pharmaceuticals 

sector. The exceptional performance of this 
predominantly foreign-owned sector generated a 
massive jump in factor outflows in 2002, so that growth 
in the income measure GNI fell well behind that of 
GDP; in view of an emer
ging decline in net factor 
outflows, the opposite is expected to occur in 2003. 
 Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
 The economy is expected to show a broad-based 
recovery, with growth accelerating towards that 
commonly thought to be sustainable in the medium 

term, of some 5% in annualised terms. On the domestic 
side, private consumption is supported by a gradual rise 
in real disposable incomes and a modest fall in the 
savings rate. By contrast, the contribution of public 
consumption to growth falls by virtue of further 

spending restraint and the announced cap on public 
sector employment. The pick-up in investment does not 
extend to housing, where annual output is forecast to 
have peaked in 2003. The strengthening of the external 
environment leads to a recovery of net exports, which 
account for close to half of 
the forecast growth rate of 
3.7% and 4.9% in 2004 and 2005 respectively. As net 
profit outflows are expected to resume their normal 
upward trend, the corresponding growth rates in GNI 
terms are somewhat lower. 
 Labour market 
 While the unemployment rate has increased from a 
trough of 3.8% during the first half of 2001, the overall 

rise, to some 4¾% in 2003Q3, has been relatively mild, 
as weak employment gains have combined with 
moderating labour force growth. A slight further rise to 
just over 5% is expected in 2004, but no further 
deterioration is expected for 2005. 

 Costs and prices 
 A marked easing in per capita compensation growth 
took place in 2002 given th
e flexibility of the Irish 
economy in the face of a 
deteriorating external environment. The fairly moderate pay provisions for the 

private sector in the latest national agreement, 
Sustaining Progress
, and easing price pressures should 
foster further wage moderation and thereby help 
maintain competitiveness, although the latest data on 
industrial earnings point to some upward pressure. 

HICP inflation, which averaged 4.7% in 2002, has 
eased to just below 4% since May, although the 
downward pressures stemming from weak activity, 

moderating earnings growth and a stronger currency 
have been partly counteracted by a range of increases in

 indirect taxes and user charges. In the absence of 
further significant increases of this nature, inflation 
should fall further, from an expected 4.1% in 2003 to 

2¾% in 2005, thus narrowing the differential with the 
euro area average. 
 Public finances
  The budget for 2003 implemented various revenue-

raising measures, almost halved the growth rate of 
current discretionary expenditure (to 8% from 15% in 
2002) and cut capital outlays. 
The deficit is forecast to 
reach 0.9% of GDP with some savings on spending 

broadly offsetting the emerging tax undershoot relative 

to the budget target. Becau
se the 2004 budget will be 
unveiled in December, the forecast adopts a no-policy 
change scenario for both 2004 and 2005. Given the 
non-indexed nature of the tax and social benefit system, 
this scenario is made operational, in the absence of 

previously announced measures, by freezing average 
tax rates and adjusting social
 transfer payments by the 
forecast CPI inflation rate (with a small top-up). The 
forecast further assumes that payment of the 
ﬁbenchmarkingﬂ awards (upward adjustments to public 
sector pay scales from a comparison with rates for 

similar jobs in the private 
sector) proceeds as foreseen 
in the national agreement and that public investment is 

maintained at 4% of GDP to allow for the roll-out of 
planned infrastructure project
s. On these assumptions, 
the deficit is forecast to wi
den to 1.2% of GDP in 2004 
and 1.1% in 2005, while government debt stabilises at 

around 34% of GDP.

56304978 European Economy8. Italy  Slow upturn on the cards  The economy in 2003 and prospects to 2005 
 The Italian economy went into a mild recession in the 
first half of the year, as economic growth tailed off in 
view of the weak economic environment and coupled 

with the expiry of fiscal in
centives at the end of 2002. 
In particular, gross fixed capital formation fell sharply 

as investment plans had been brought forward 

creating a void in the first two quarters of 2003. The 
impact of the stronger eu
ro on exports acted as an 
additional drag. Only consumption expenditure 
continued to grow at a relatively steady rate.  
 Signs of an improving short-term outlook started 
materialising around mid-year chiefly on account of 
recovering output figures in the manufacturing 

industry in the third quarter. On the demand side 
export activity also appears to be recuperating from 
the negative performance at the beginning of 2003 

and consumption expenditure continues to hold up 
comparatively well. However, in the year as whole, 
real GDP is projected to in
crease by only 0.3% as the 
expected pick-up in economic activity in the second 
half of 2003 is likely to be very gradual, essentially 
brought about by the levelling out of the investment 

slump. 
 On the back of the assumed improvement in the 

economic environment, esp
ecially outside the euro 
area, the gradual recovery of economic activity in 

2003 is projected to continue and to gain additional 

strength in the following two years. Real GDP growth 
is forecast to accelerate to 1.5% in 2004 and to climb 
to 1.9%, above the potential rate, in 2005. The 
recovery is assumed to be largely driven by 

domestic demand, as investment expenditure picks-
up progressively alongside a steady expansion of 

private consumption underpinned by slowly 
declining inflation and job creation. The revival of 
stock markets observed in 2003, which in the 

assumed context of an overall improvement of the 
economic outlook is expected to stay, is likely to 
produce a positive wealth-e
ffect contributing to the 
performance of consumption. Although to a lesser 
degree, the drag from the external side on economic 
growth is expected to continue in 2004, reflecting 
the tendency of Italian exports to lose shares in an 
expanding global market without the help from 

falling exchange rates.  
 Costs and prices  
 Inflation has remained stubbornly high throughout 
2003, unaffected by the widening negative output 

gap and the stronger euro. The annual rate of 
increase of the HICP bas been virtually stuck at 
around 2.8%, with the differ
ential vis-à-vis the euro 
area widening to one full percentage point. While a 
series of special factors may have fuelled 
inflationary pressure, it is becoming increasingly 

evident that structural fact
ors such as the lack of 
competition may also be at play. The marked 

increase in unit labour costs estimated for 2003 

chiefly reflects the cyclical slowdown in 
productivity, whereas wage developments are 
projected to remain relatively benign.  
 As the effect of special factors, such as the drought 
in summer 2003, peter out and the negative output 
gap narrows slowly, inflation is expected to ease 
gradually over the course of the coming two years. 

Although industrial relations deteriorated in the 
recent past, labour costs 
are projected to remain 
conducive to moderate inflationary pressure to the 
extent that future wage agreements adhere to the 
1993 agreement basing wa
ge increases on a low 
inflation target.  
 Labour market  
 With a significant lag 
compared to economic 
growth, job creation ground to a halt around mid-
year 2003 and is assumed to recover slowly towards 

the end of the year. Thanks to a pro-cyclical 
behaviour of the labour force the rate of

  unemployment is not expected to rise. It is projected 
to stabilise around 8.8% in 2004 and to resume its 
downward trend in the following year. The role of 

non-standard contracts is fo
reseen to rise again over 
the course of the projected economic recovery. 
 Public finances 
 The general government deficit is estimated to 
increase to 2.6% of GDP in 2003. The marked drop in 
the primary surplus is partly
 offset by a still sizeable 
decline in interest paymen
ts. The budgetary outturn 
depends crucially on the impact of transitory 

measures (above all a tax amnesty), expected to be 1.6 

pp of GDP. In 2002 one-off measures (primarily sales 
of real assets) reduced the deficit by 1.0 pp. 
Correcting for the effects of the cycle, the improvement in the budget balance is marginal. 
In 2004, the deficit is expect
ed to increase to 2.8% of 
GDP, with the primary surplus falling by 0.5 pp to 
2.2% of GDP. The main uncertainties concern the 
large expected impact of
 budgetary measures of 
difficult assessment and the strains which may arise in 
the implementation of the domestic stability pact. In 

the Commission forecast, th
e total impact of one-off 
factors (which include sales of publicly-owned real 
assets, an amnesty for building offences and a tax 

settlement scheme) is estimated at 1.0 pp of GDP in 
2004. It is prudentially assumed that ANAS (the 

agency responsible for maintenance and investment 
in the state- road network) continues to be classified 
within the general government sector. The impact of 
the enabling legislation on the reform of the pension 
system, not fully defined at the cut-off date, has not 
been incorporated. The forecast for 2005 is based on 
legislation currently in force. 
Despite a cash deficit in excess of 4.5% of GDP, the 
government debt ratio slightly declines in 2003, 
principally by drawing on cash assets held by the 
government with the Bank of Italy. Pending details, 

the impact of the announ
ced privatization of the 
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti has not been included. In 

2004 the debt ratio continues to decline marginally 

to around 106% of GDP,
 chiefly through sizeable planned disposals of financial assets.

58304978 European Economy9. Luxembourg  Adjustments to spell of weak growth
    The economy in 2003 
 Following many years of real GDP growth well above 
the EU average, economic growth in Luxembourg 
slowed down sharply in 2001, to 1.2%. Economic 
growth in 2002, at 1.3%, was at around the same rate. 

Because of the importance of 
the financial sector to the 
economy of the Grand Duchy,
 the negative impact of 
the turmoil on financial markets was substantial. The 

resulting drag on activity continued into 2003, as firms 
adjusted to the shock. Weak
 profits and balance sheet 
restructuring held back investment. As slowdown in 

economic activity spread to 
sheltered sectors of the 
economy in the course of th
is year, the negative impact 
on employment was increasing
ly felt. Real GDP growth is estimated to be slightly higher than 1% in 2003. The 
contribution from domestic demand would decrease as 

private consumption decelerates
 due to worsened labour 
market conditions. However, the considerable 

destocking that occurred in
 2002 would end. The recent 
resilience in global financial market seems to bode well 
for medium-term prospects. 
 Prospects for 2004 and 2005 
 Economic activity is expected to pick up only 
moderately in 2004. Real GDP growth is forecast at a 
1.9%, before increasing further to 2.8% in 2005. The 
recovery would primarily 
be driven by increased 
domestic demand and in particular by investment 
catching up as exte
rnal conditions continue to improve. 
 The expected global reco
very should also benefit 
exports: the net trade contribution is expected to turn 
positive in 2004 and 2005. Private consumption would 

remain rather resilient over the projection horizon with 
respect to past growth rates, as employment growth and 
the growth rate of real compensation per employee 

would remain positive. Nevertheless, the pick up in the 
rate of real GDP growth, to 2.8% in 2005, would be 
relatively slow compared to 
previous cyclical upturns, 
largely explained by historically weak growth of 
exports of financial services.  
In Luxembourg, cross-border employment is highly 
sensitive to cyclical conditi
ons, which translates into 
sharp swings in cross-border labour flows. Total 
employment growth is forecast
 to decelerate to around 
1% in both 2004 and 2005. The worsening in the labour 

market would lead to a marked rise in the number of 

resident unemployed, even th
ough this increase is likely 
to be cushioned somewhat by the specific employment 

schemes. Thus, the unemployment rate is expected to 

increase markedly over the fo
recast horizon, to over 4% 
by 2005. 

 Costs and prices 
 Average HICP inflation stood a 2.1% in 2002 and is 
expected to average 2.2% 
in 2003 before decreasing 
slightly to 2% in 2004 and 1.7% in 2005, in response to 

weak import prices, relatively moderate wage increases, 

a cyclical upturn in productivity and the fading of the 
upward impact of the introduction of the cash euro. In 
2004 increases in excise duties on petrol would 
introduce some upward price pressures from energy 
prices (0.1-0.2%). Underlying inflation would show 

some resilience to go below 2% despite slow growth 
and unemployment edging up. 
 Public finances 
The public finance situation is
 expected to deteriorate markedly over the projection period. In 2002, the fiscal 
accounts still registered a subs
tantial surplus of  2.4% 
of GDP, to a large extent due to the lagged response of 

corporate tax revenues to 
the economic slowdown, to 
some increase in th
e collection of back taxes, and to 
lower expenditure from speci
al funds. In 2003, the 
general government balance is 
expected to turn into a 
deficit of 0.6% of GDP. A further marked deterioration 
is expected in 2004, with the deficit rising to 2.1% of 
GDP. Continued sluggish revenues, mostly due

rates of total current and investment expenditure are 

expected to weaken comp
ared to the high rates 
registered in 2002, the deceleration would not be 

sufficient to prevent the nominal deficit from rising 

to 2.5% of GDP by 2005. While most of the expected 
deterioration of the budget balance is accounted for 
by central government, local government revenues 
would also be affected ne
gatively by the effects of 
the earlier tax reforms from 2004 onwards. The 

balance of social security funds should remain 

positive over the forecast horizon, but surpluses are 
expected to be lower than in previous years, largely 
due to the worsening in the labour market. The 

already low gross government 
debt ratio is forecast to 
decline slightly to 4.1% of GDP in 2005.

60304978 European Economy10. Netherlands   Deficit rises as recession deepens, substantial fiscal tightening
  Recession in first half of 2003 
 Real GDP shrank in the first half of 2003 and is 
expected to decline by 0.9% on average in the year as a 
whole, compared to a meagre positive growth rate of 
0.2% in 2002. Real GDP fell by 1.2% year-on-year and 

0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of 2003, 
the third consecutive quarter of decline. Available data 
and leading indicators give no indication of a clear 

rebound in growth in the remainder of the year. 
Following years of buoyant growth, private 
consumption is forecast to 
decrease by around 1% in 
the wake of rising unemployment, rising pension 

premiums, fading wealth effects from the housing 

market, fiscal consolidation weighing on disposable 
income, and confidence falling to record lows. The 
growth rate of real government consumption would 

decrease markedly to 0.7%, co
mpared to close to 4% in 
2002. Gross capital formation is expected to decrease 

by around 3% in response to
 weak profits, balance sheet 
adjustments in the corpor
ate sector, relatively low 
capacity utilisation rates and the uncertain near-term 

outlook while exports suffer from the economic 

downturn, aggravated by the loss in price 
competitiveness of Dutch exporters due to high wage 
and price increases in recent
 years. Unemployment has 
risen markedly in the course of this year as employment 
growth is set to turn negative in response to the cyclical 
downturn, while wages and prices have been on a clear 

downward trend. 
  Export-driven recovery expected 
 A very muted recovery is expected, starting towards the 

end of 2003. Real GDP growth is projected to reach no 
more than 0.6% in 2004, and to strengthen to 2% in 
2005. In 2004, the projected 
recovery would to a large 
extent be due to more supportive net trade, whereas 
domestic demand would remain sluggish initially and 
recover only towards the end of the forecast horizon. 

Despite projected export growth of close to 6% in 2005, 
Dutch exporters would suffer further losses in market 
share, as competitiveness would only slowly be 
restored. Private consumption growth is expected to 
stagnate in 2004 and to recover only in 2005, reflecting 

relatively weak income growth in response to the 
marked further worsening in the labour market, the 
negative impact of fiscal consolidation on disposable 

income, and the continuation of a relatively high 
savings ratio. Private non-residential capital formation 
is expected to recover only gradually and to reach a 

growth rate of close to 2% by 2005, in line with the 
muted recovery as balance 
sheet adjustments and lower 
wage growth bear fruit and profitably would be 
gradually restored. Total employment is forecast to 
decrease by 0.8% in 2004 and to increase only 
marginally in 2005. This reflects the lagged response of 

the labour market to the severe economic slowdown. 
Hence the unemployment rate would continue to rise 
over the forecast horizon, 
to reach over 6% in 2005. 
 Deceleration in costs and prices 
 CPI inflation is expected to
 decrease markedly over the 
forecast horizon, from 3.9% in
 2002 to 2.4% in 2003 
and 1.3% and 0.9% in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This 
partly reflects lower import pr
ices, but is primarily due 
to a substantial easing of unit labour costs. Overall 
wage growth is expected to moderate substantially in 
response to the rather bleak economic outlook, the 
agreement reached among social partners to freeze 

contractual wage increases in the next two years, and 
the prospect of falling inflation. 
 Public finances 
 The fiscal accounts deteriorat
ed markedly in 2002 and 
showed a deficit of 1.6% of GDP, after a balanced 
budget in 2001. This deterioration of public finances 
mainly reflects the impact of the sharp economic 

downturn. However, revenue  shortfalls related to

 tax-deductible mortgage payments also added to the 
deficit, while deterioration in the balance of the sub-
sector local government also 
played a role in 2002. The 
weak economic prospects imply a further deterioration 
of the general government balance in 2003 and 2004, 
despite substantial fiscal consolidation. The austerity 

measures put in place in 2003 and 2004 to help limit the 
increase in the deficit are equi
valent to 2.5% of GDP in 
total. Planned expenditure reductions stem, inter alia, 
from reforms in social security, wage restraint in the 
public sector, the repeal of
 tax incentives for early 
retirement, measures to control health care spending, 

and a reduction of subsidies.  
 On the revenue side, taxes and social security 
contributions will be raised. In spite of these efforts for 
2003, a general government deficit of 2.6% of GDP is 

expected. In 2004 the defic
it would increase slightly to 
2.7% of GDP, before decreasing somewhat to a deficit 

of 2.4% of GDP in 2005 in response to the economic 

upturn. The cyclically adjusted general government 
balance is projected to improve gradually from 2.1% of 
GDP in 2002 to 0.6% of GDP in 2005. As a result of 

projected deficits and weak economic growth the gross 
government debt ratio would be on a modest upward 
trend and stabilise at 55.5% of GDP in 2004 and 2005.

62304978 European Economy11. Austria  Unemployment stays high despite pick-up in growth 
 Developments in 2003 and prospects 
Economic growth stayed on a slow pace in the first half 
year. Contrary to last year, growth was supported by 
domestic demand components, above all moderately 

expanding household consumption and investment 
recovering slowly from the slump in 2002. Exports, by 
contrast, almost stagnated as demand from central and 

eastern Europe slowed down considerably. With 
imports picking up, the external contribution to growth 
decreased markedly. In all, growth of real GDP is set to 

reach only 0.9% in 2003. 
With the international upswing gaining momentum, 
exports should rebound. Together with strengthening 
domestic demand, GDP growth is projected to 
accelerate to 1.9% in 2004 and 
further to a rate of 2.5% 
in 2005. 
Demand components 
Household real disposable income will rise only 
moderately in 2003 and 2004, before accelerating in 

2005, thanks to a pick-up in labour demand and 
declining inflation. Private consumption is nevertheless 
expected to remain resilient in 2003 and to rebound in 

2004. After adoption of the pension reform last June, 
the political debate on changes to the welfare system 
that may have led to uncertainty and consumption  

restraint, will cease for so
me time. Moreover, an 
income tax relief becoming effective at the beginning of 

2004 and a more substantial one planned for 2005, in 

combination with the improved outlook on the labour 
market should boost consumer confidence. Public 
consumption is forecast to 
remain subdued throughout 
the projection period, assuming that the government 
continues its efforts to co
ntain budgetary spending. 
Investment edged up in the first half of 2003, with 
equipment investment accelerating considerably, 
induced most likely by a tax incentive favouring 
investments undertaken in the year 2003. In 2004, a 

negative echo-effect in comb
ination with sufficient 
spare capacity may hold back a stronger rebound of 

equipment investment to be expected from the 

improved export outlook. Construction investment is 
projected to strengthen th
roughout the forecast period. 
Exports are expected to rebound in 2004 and gain 

further momentum in 2005. Despite accelerating 
imports, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth 

should turn positive as of 2004 but remain small.   
Prices and wages  
While on the whole remaining subdued, consumer price 
inflation is likely to accelerate temporarily in 2004 

owing to an increase in energy taxes and excise duties 
on tobacco. Notwithstanding continued wage 
moderation in the private sector, nominal increases in 

contractual wages are estimated to pick up somewhat 
already in 2004 du
e to the expected cyclical upswing 
and to accelerate further in 
2005. In the public sector, 
very moderate wage agreemen
ts are expected for both 
2004 and 2005, given the rather generous pay rise in 
2003 compensating for purchasing power losses in the 

previous years. 
Labour market 
The deceleration in overall output growth in 2003 had 
an adverse impact on the labour market, with dependent 
employment virtually stagnating. Given the usual time 
lag of about six months, a more sustained pick-up in 

labour demand can be expected only in late 2004, when 
economic activity should have gained momentum. 
Given elastic labour supply, the rebound in growth will 

not translate immediately into falling unemployment, 
after the sharp rise in 2003. Only in 2005, the increase 
in labour demand is estimate
d to outpace labour supply, helped by the population of working age starting to 
decline due to demographic ageing. 
Public finances 
Revised data for 2002 show that the budgetary outcome 
was actually better than preliminary figures had 
indicated. The budgetary position weakened by half a 
percentage point of GDP to a deficit of 0.2% (revised 

downwards from a deficit 0.6%) after a surplus of 0.3% 
of GDP in 2001.

, Austria
   The twin-budget for 2003 and 2004 was adopted in 
mid-June, thereby largely incorporating the delay in 
the economic recovery. Despite the rather bleak 

cyclical situation entailing weaker-than-anticipated 
employment growth, central government data suggest 
that tax revenues in 2003 could develop more 

favourably than budgeted, mainly reflecting the 
authorities' successful fight against VAT fraud. 
However, expenditure is expected to overshoot the 
target, reflecting a sharper-than-expected rise in 
unemployment and additional discretionary spending 
such as an increase in soci
al transfers, an extra pay-
rise for public sector employees, additional labour 

market expenditure foreseen in the fiscal stimulus 

package, topped by deferred flood-related spending. 
In sum, the general government deficit is projected to 
widen to some 1% of GDP in 2003.  

   
   In 2004, the first step of the tax reform will take 
effect. Income tax cuts and related measures will, 
however, be largely offset by a rise in social 

contributions. As a result, th
e budgetary effect of the 
tax relief should be neutral. Savings from the pension  

reform for private and federal employees should 

largely outpace the increase in discretionary 
spending. Helped by the expected pick-up in 
domestic demand, the general government deficit is 

estimated to narrow by almost ½ percentage point of 
GDP.  
In the light of the project
ed cyclical upswing, the 
deficit should decline further in 2005. Given the 
Commission™s no-policy-change assumption, the 
forecast for 2005, does not, 
however, incorporate the 
second step of the tax reform, which is planned but 
has not yet been presented to parliament.

64304978 European Economy12. Portugal  A large and persistent output gap 
is hindering budgetary consolidation
  Overall developments and prospects 
In Portugal, the impact of
 the cyclical downturn in 
the European economy is being accentuated by the 
undergoing economic adjustment. In fact, domestic 
demand has been receding since the last quarter of 

2001, after a period of rapid growth at the end of the 
previous decade, which led to significant rises in the 
indebtedness levels for the private sector of the 

economy, and to an unsustai
nable increase in the net borrowing of the economy.  
Despite the protracted fall of domestic demand, 
quarter-on-quarter output receded only in the second 
half of 2002, reflecting the progressive improvement 
of the net external balance. Despite the expectation of 
slow but positive growth for all quarters of 2003, 

GDP growth for the whole y
ear is projected to fall by 
about ¾%, because of the negative carry-over from 

2002. 
As regards the forecast peri
od, although both private 
consumption and investment are expected to 
gradually strengthen, domestic demand is expected to 
continue growing below output, because of the 
continued efforts by private sector agents to redress 

their balance sheets, combin
ed with the re-orientation 
of production towards exports, which is supported by 

a high degree of wage moderation and the projected 

pick-up in foreign demand. Consequently, the 
external account is expected to be close to balance by 
the end of the forecast pe
riod. Overall, GDP is 
expected to grow by about 1% in 2004, largely 

reflecting the low carry-over from 2003, accelerating 
to about 2% in 2005. 
Prices  HICP inflation is forecast to
 decelerate in the second 
half of 2003. Moderate import price inflation, low 
wage increases, and subdued domestic demand 
throughout the forecast peri
od are all expected to 
contribute to inflation abating from 3.4% in 2003 to 
about 2½% on average in the 2004 and 2005 period. 
Labour Market 
The labour market situation deteriorated significantly 
at the end of 2002. Cyclical developments are 
expected to lead to a decline in employment in 2003 
and to a near stagnation in 2004, while the growth 
rate of the labour force is
 expected to slowdown. The 
unemployment rate is expected to exceed 7% in both 
2004 and 2005. The worsening of labour market 
conditions is expected to reduce wage settlements for 
the private sector of the eco
nomy. The growth rate of 
total wages per employee is expected to decelerate 
from 5½% in 2002 to about 2¼-½% on average in the 
2004-2005 period, such that the trend decline in 

price-competitiveness looks set to come to a halt. In 
the forecast period, households' real disposable 
income is expected to gr
owth on average by about 
½% per year. This relative strong pace given the 
forecast for employment a
nd real wages, largely 
reflects the announced government policy of a phased 
convergence of low pensions towards the minimum 
wage. 
Public finances 
The cumulative loss in output in consecutive 
quarters, implying a fall in real GDP for the whole of 
2003, is causing substantial shortfalls in tax revenue. 
In the first nine months of 2003, tax revenues in the 
state sector receded by 5.
6% year-on-year. Against 
(positive) nominal GDP growth of around 2½%, this 
suggests that the tax system is very sensitive to 
cyclical movements. Government expenditure, for its 
part, is growing  broadly in line with targeted for 

2003. 
These revenue and expenditure developments would 
lead to a government deficit above 3% of GDP in 
2003. In order to prevent it, the Portuguese 
authorities have introduced two one-off measures, 

together worth more than 2% of GDP: i) a lump-sum 
payment by the Post Office (CTT) to the government 
in exchange of the transfer to government of their 

unfunded pension obligations, ii) the sale to a 
financial corporation of non-performing tax claims 
(i.e. tax arrears). Both op
erations are being closely

  scrutinised by Eurostat. Taking into account these 
one-off measures, the deficit for 2003 is forecast to 
be 2.9% of GDP. 
The budget draft for 2004 projects a general 
government deficit of 2.8% of GDP. Tax revenue is 

estimated to increase by 3.
1%, which compares with 
nominal GDP growth of 3½% (and real growth of 

1%), while total current primary expenditure is 

planned to increase by 3%, thereby below nominal 
GDP growth. The draft budget for 2004 includes 
one-off measures amounting to some 1.1% of GDP. 
The present forecast takes on board the full amount 
of one-off measures planned for 2004, although as 

regards the sale of property (0.7% of GDP), a partial 
realisation of the sales programme could be a more 
likely outcome.   
Although the macroeconomic assumptions 
underlying the Commission forecast differ only 
marginally from those made in the budget draft, the 

Commission's general governme
nt deficit forecast for 2004 is 3.3% of GDP, which is above the official 
budgetary target. This can basically be accounted for 
by two factors: carry-over effects from 2003 caused 
by the lower tax revenue proj
ected for that year in the 
forecast, combined with 
a more prudent assessment 
of the impact on government accounts of the 

reduction in the corporate profit tax rate from 30 to 

25%.  
The budget forecas
t for 2004 is contingent upon the 
projected decline in  the growth rate for total current 
expenditure, and in particular for the component of 
social transfers. Indeed
, the assumed slowdown of 
total current expenditure growth from 4.5% in 2003 

to 3.1%, and for social tran
sfers (other than in kind) 
from 9.0% to 5.2%, is an ambitious target.  
For 2005, the forecast for the general government 
deficit is based on legislation currently in force as 
amended by the draft budget for 2004 (the ﬁno-

policy-changeﬂ assumption). The actual deficit is 
projected to be close to 
4% of GDP, reflecting the 
persistence of a large (negative) output gap, and the 
fading out of the effect of one-off operations.

66304978 European Economy13. Finland  Private consumption driving th
e gradual revival of activity  - Developments in 2003
   Last year, Finland was one of
 the very few countries in 
the EU to experience a pick
-up in economic activity. 
Boosted by domestic and external demand alike, real 

GDP rose by 2.2%, up from 1.2% in 2001. However, 

following the better-than-expected performance in 
2002, demand and output receded by 0.8% in the first 
quarter of 2003 from the previous period. This was due 

to a fall in foreign demand and a further decline in 
investment. The economy rebounded in the second 
quarter of 2003, with real GDP increasing by 0.6% 
quarter-on-quarter. The driving force behind this 
increase were exports, which climbed by 2.5% on the 

quarter. Final domestic demand moved up steadily in 
the first half of the year, with private consumption 
giving firm support, while public consumption 

advanced only modestly. Investment, however, 
continued its declining trend, suffering from weaker 
final demand prospects. 

 The subdued activity has taken its toll on the labour 
market, as net employment creation has been on a 

declining path recording a cumulative contraction of 
0.2% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2003. 
Despite the fall in employment, unemployment has 

remained fairly stable as labour supply has fallen. From 
an average rate of 9.1% (s.a.) in 2002, unemployment 
has remained unchanged between January and 

September 2003. Inflation (HICP) eased quickly from 
an average of 2.0% in 2002 to 1.2% in September 2003. 
This was mainly due to lower prices of services and the 
stronger euro keeping import price pressures moderate. 
Prospects 

 Even though the economy has returned to the growth 
trend, there are still downside risks in the international 
economy, which if realised will delay a further 
recovery. Moreover, signs of lasting economic growth 

are confined to private 
consumption and housing 
investment. Therefore, activity is set to advance at a 

moderate pace in the second half of 2003, resulting in 

average growth of about 
1½% in 2003. Against the 
background of an assumed recovery in foreign demand 

and continued healthy domestic demand, the economy 
is projected to reach an annual GDP growth rate of 
2½% in 2004 and  2¾% in 2005. 

 Following from the projected profile of activity, job 
creation is expected to ease in the last months of 2003, 

implying a decline in employment and a small rise in 
unemployment for the year as
 a whole. For the future, 
as the assumed recovery gradually gathers pace, 
employment is projected to rise slightly in 2004 and 
further in 2005. 
 GDP components  
 Private consumption is expected
 to continue to drive the 
economic recovery on the 
back of steady gains in disposable income following from wage increases and 
further income tax cuts in 2003 and 2004. Public 

spending is also expected to accelerate, based on the 
stimulatory measures introduced in the 2004 budget 
proposal. Investment activity, lacking the stimulus from 
external demand and suffering from excess capacity, is 
projected to decline in 2003, but revive in 2004-2005.  
Exports are expected to decel
erate this year, but in 2004 
they should gain from the improved international 
economic outlook and furt
her accelerate in 2005. 
Prospects for exports of telecommunication equipment, 
but also of forest products appear somewhat promising. 
However, higher consumer spending is expected to 

raise imports, squeezing the 
contribution from external 
demand to GDP growth. 

 Costs and prices 
 For 2003, HICP inflation is 
projected to average 1.4%. 
In 2004, alcohol tax cuts of 33% on average will reduce 
price pressures, bringing inflation further down to about

    1% in 2004. In 2005, inflation may rise to 1.7%, as 
the economy expands and the effect of the tax cut 
fades away. In December 2002, a centralised two-

year wage agreement provided for general wage rises 
of 2.9% in 2003 and 2.2% in 2004. Assuming the 
usual wage drift of about 1 percentage point, per-

capita wages are expected to increase by nearly 4% in 
2003 and about 3 ½% in 2004-05. However, higher 
growth in overall productivity appears likely to curb 

the rise in unit labour costs.  
 Public finances 
 The general government financial surplus is expected 
to decrease by about 1 ¾ percentage points to some 
2½% of GDP in 2003. This results from a declining 
overall revenue intake, and expansionary measures 

proposed by the new government.  
  
  Moreover, the financial position of local governments 

appears to slip further into deficit due to weaker tax 
receipts and moderate expe
nditures growth. Public 
sector finances will stay in surplus due to social 
security funds surplus. Ba
sed on the government™s 
medium-term spending guidelines of Spring 2003 
and the budget proposal for 2004, the general 
government surplus is estimated to edge down further 
to some 1.7% of GDP in 2004, while stronger 

economic activity is expected
 to bring it up to 1.9 % 
in 2005. 

 In 2003-2005, the debt ratio 
is anticipated to ease to 
44.3% of GDP by the end of the forecast period.

68304978 European Economy14. Sweden  Economic growth to revive
 after mild downturn 
  The economy in 2003  
 Swedish economic growth has been rather subdued so 

far in 2003, with GDP growth of 1.5% on the year in 
the first half of the year. Exports have improved after 
two years of very poor growth. At the same time, 

imports have risen faster, resulting in a low growth 
contribution from net exports. On the domestic side, 
economic activity has been mixed. Private consumption 

growth has been relatively strong. By contrast, 
investment growth has been poor, linked to continued 
uncertain business prospects. Public consumption 
growth has been rather weak, reflecting some budgetary 
constraints. Inflation has come down considerably 

during the year and as inflationary pressures should 
remain subdued, the repo-rate has been cut twice in 
2003. 

 Prospects 
 Recent indicators are mixed and there is a clear 
distinction between consumers and business 
expectations. Consumer conf
idence indicators, and in 
particular consumers' expectations regarding their own 
economy, give a positive picture. The overall indicator 
was up in September for the fifth consecutive month. 

Business confidence indicators are by contrast 
substantially less positive and companies generally 
report weak developments regarding export markets. 

This impacts heavily on the very open Swedish 
economy. These prospects, both domestically and 
externally, are expected to 
result in relatively subdued 
GDP growth in 2003. Domestic demand growth should 

be fairly stable and external demand growth should pick 
up during 2003, resulting in stronger exports. In 2004, 
economic growth is expected
 to strengthen, as the 
recovery world-wide should be
 more firmly in place. In 
2005, economic growth is expected to be close to the 

potential growth rate. Overall,
 GDP is expected to grow 
by 1.4% in 2003, 2.2% in 2004 and 2.6% in 2005. 
 Inflationary pressures are ex
pected to remain subdued 
over the forecast period and inflation should return to 
2% at the end of 2005. With gradually stronger GDP 
growth over this period, interest rates may rise slightly. 
Wage increases are expected to be moderate in the 
years to 2005, in part as the rise in unemployment 
observed this year is not expected to be reverted during 

this period.  
 GDP components 
 Despite a slowdown in disposable income growth in 
2003, private consumption is expected to continue to 

grow steadily. Consumer confidence has improved 
significantly recently. Financial wealth has partially 
recovered from the long slump in the stock markets, 

with the recent surge in e
quity prices. House prices 
have continued to rise steadily, contributing to a 

relatively strong wealth position of households. 

Moreover, the saving rate of households reached an 
exceptionally high level in 2002 - up by 6 percentage 
points between 2000 and 2002 - which provides room 

for relatively high consumption growth over the 
forecast period. All in all, th
is should result in stable 
consumption growth in the years to 2005. Public 

consumption is expected to
 be weak over the forecast 
period, in part due to budgetary constraints at the local 
and central level. Investment growth is expected to be 
negative, while gradually improving, in 2003 as 
business prospects remain uncertain and also due to a 

negative overhang into 2003. A rise in investment is 
foreseen for 2004 and further in 2005, as economic 
activity gathers momentum and the productive capacity 

needs to be expanded, following a period of falling 
investment. Swedish exports rises faster in 2003, as 
external demand growth strengthens. In 2004 and 2005, 

a further recovery in exports is expected, in line with 
world markets. Imports too should continue to rise over 
the forecast period, as final demand recovers gradually.
   Costs and prices 
 Inflation has come down considerably since the 
electricity and energy  price hi
ke  last winter,  reflecting

   relatively weak economic activity during this period. 
These factors should be le
ss important from early 2004 
onwards and inflationary pressures should be very 
subdued. As demand and growth revives further in 
2005, inflation is expected to gradually rise to close to 
2% towards the end of 2005. Wage increases are 

expected to be moderate over the forecast period. New 
wage negotiations foreseen to start this autumn are 
likely to result in moderate wage increases. This can 

partly be attributed to some deterioration in the labour 
market in 2003, which is not expected to be fully 
reverted in the years to 2005.  
 Labour market 
 Employment growth has been virtually zero since 2002. 
The unemployment rate has risen in the first half of 

2003, in part as a result of fewer people engaged in 
labour market programmes. The gradual increase in 
economic activity foreseen from 2004 onwards is 

expected to create little in 
the way of employment until 
2005.  

 Public finances 
In 2003, the surplus in public finances is expected to be 
relatively low, mainly due to weaker economic growth. 
In 2004, overall revenues ar
e expected to rise in line with nominal GDP. The expenditure-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to fall slightly, in part, as the government 
remains committed to the previously set expenditure 

ceilings on central government, as announced in the 
Budget Bill for 2004. In 2005, a higher surplus in the 
public finances is projected on current policies, due to 

stronger economic activity. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to fall over the forecast period and to be 50% 
of GDP in 2005.

70304978 European Economy15. United Kingdom 
 Robust recovery, as investment and net exports revive 
 The economy in 2003  
 The UK economy weathered the recent global slow-
down well. Weakness in exports and investment were 
more than offset by strong household consumption and 
general government spending. 

 The Office for National Statistics revised extensively 
historical national accounts data due to methodological 
improvements. Real GDP growth for 1998, 1999, and 
2000 was revised up, while for 2002 it was revised 
down. The general pattern is of more robust growth 
than previously believed. 
 
The new numbers indicate th
at recent UK GDP growth 
was more balanced than previously thought, with less 

household and general government consumption and 

better corporate investment and exports. Household 
expenditure nevertheless continues as a significant 
driver of growth. Fixed investment has been weak but 

picked up in 2003Q2. General government consumption 
has been a significant contributor to GDP growth. The 
significant drag to growth by net exports of goods and 

services reflects the continued weakness in world 
demand, but this effect is diminishing as external 
conditions improve. 

 On the output side, services output slowed in Q2, while 
construction grew strongly. Manufacturing output 

picked up in Q2, ending a long period of decline. 
Employment has stayed strong but this kept 
productivity growth (in terms of output per head) 
relatively low. Inflationary pressures have remained 
low. RPIX inflation has risen a little above the 
government™s 2.5% target, but it is well within the 

permitted one-percentage-point symmetrical margin.   
HICP inflation is appreciably lower at less than 1½%. 
 Prospects  
 Growth is expected to be around 2% in 2003, rising to 
2.8% and 2.9%, slightly above trend, in 2004 and 2005 
respectively. Final demand is expected to strengthen, 
with slower household and government consumption 
being offset by a pick-up in corporate investment and 
net exports. A negative output gap of around 1% of 

GDP has emerged following below-trend growth in 
2002, so supply constraints, overall, should not 
constrain growth. Unemployment is expected to remain 

close to its NAIRU level of 5% throughout the forecast 
period. Wages should rise from recent rates that have 

been depressed by low bonus payments. This is 

accompanied by a pick-up 
in labour productivity growth, so growth in unit labour costs will remain 

subdued.  Interest rates may rise slightly over the period 

as growth picks up. 
 GDP components  
 Growth in household consumption is maintained over 
the forecast period, but at more modest levels. Real 

wage earnings are expected to grow moderately and 
disposable incomes continue to benefit from low 
interest rates. Although the UK™s house price inflation 
rate slowed somewhat duri
ng 2003, equity markets are recovering, and this is helping to keep the household 
balance sheet healthy despite recent build-ups in gross 
debt. Nevertheless, the savings rate is expected to 
increase over the forecast pe
riod. There will be more 
fixed investment, due to strong planned boosts to 
general government investment and a better financial 
position of companies with reviving business 

expectations and increased profitability. The 
importance of government consumption will diminish, 
as would be expected from the government™s plans. 

Export growth is expected to recover strongly during 
the forecast period. 
 Labour Market  
 Rises in wage earnings continue to be moderate, and 
should stay that way, although compensation of 
employees per head have been boosted this year as a

costs should continue in the face of an economy 
operating a little below potential and with 
unemployment close to the NAIRU.  

 Public finances 
The general government finances recorded a deficit of 
1.5% of GDP in 2002. The deficit is expected to widen 

further in 2003 as some tax revenues, notably income 
and corporation tax, are weak, while discretionary 
expenditure growth is forecast to rise strongly as 

planned. It is assumed that expenditure will turn out 
broadly as projected by the authorities, in nominal 
terms. The Commission is thus projecting deficits of 
around 2¾% of GDP in 2003 and 2004  Œ  rather larger 
than those projected in the Spring. A fall in the deficit is 

expected in 2005 as the economy grows strongly. The 
continuation of negative output gaps throughout the 
forecast period results in a cy
clically adjusted balance 
of a little more than 2% of GDP. The ratio of gross debt 
to GDP, though increasing slightly, will be close to 
40% by the end of 2005.

72304978 European EconomyChapter 4 Acceding Countries  304978 European Economy304978 European EconomyAcceding Countries Resisting the slowdown and benefiting from accession
 Resilient economy in 2002 and beginning of 2003 
 Despite a difficult external environment, growth in the 

acceding countries remained so
lid and an acceleration is 
expected in the second half of 2003 when the 

international economy reco
vers. Average GDP growth 
in the acceding countries is forecast to be 3.1% in 2003, up from last year™s 2.3%.  Growth is driven by exports, 

expected to increase by 6.2% in 2003 and a pick-up in 

industrial production.  Private consumption growth at 
an expected 4.5% in 20
03 is robust thanks to 
purchasing power gains resulting from relatively strong 

wage increases and declining inflation.  Reflecting the 
situation at the world level, investment contracted by 

0.6% in 2002, but should again moderately grow at 
2.4% in 2003, as demand prospects improve and 
receiving additional support from easier monetary 

conditions.    
 However, the aggregate masks quite different trends at 

the country level.  Growth has been revised downward 
for most countries and is forecast to be slower 
compared to last year ex
cept for Poland, which is 
gradually emerging from two years of slow growth.  In 
2003, expected growth varies form 0.8% in Malta, 
particularly affected by a fall in tourism due to global 

uncertainty, to 6.6% in Lithuania characterised by 
buoyant investment.   
 Benefiting from EU enlargement 
 Stimulated by the recovery 
in the EU and the prospect 
of enlargement, averag
e growth in the acceding 
countries is expected to accel
erate to 3.8% in 2004 and 
to 4.2% the year th
ereafter.  Export growth is forecast 
to increase to 7.6% in 2005 for the acceding countries 

as a whole, favourably influenced by the pick-up in 

world trade and an improvement in competitiveness 
permitting to gain market share. The need to upgrade 
infrastructure remains large and investment, 

accelerating to almost 8% in 2005 according to the 
forecast, should complement exports as the main 
drivers of growth.  Private consumption is expected to 

weaken somewhat, but to remain strong (between 3.5 
and 4% in 2004-05), to which now also employment 
growth contributes.  The external contribution to 
growth remains negative in the forecasting period 
because of the large import needs of the acceding economies. 
 Employment creation remains low 
 Linked to the ongoing process of restructuring, 
employment has stopped declining in 2003 on average 

in the acceding countries.  As new industries take off 
the situation is expected to improve, but average 
employment creation remains subdued at 0.6% in 2004 

and 1.1% in 2005. Consequently, the unemployment 
rate remains high at close to 15% in 2005. 
 
From 2004, all acceding coun
tries are expected to 
register an increase in em
ployment except the Czech 
Republic, where economic growth remains among the 

lowest in the acceding countri
es.  The situation in the labour market continues to be very diverse with the 

unemployment rate ranging from 3.7% in Cyprus  to 
20.3% in Poland in 2005. 
 Subdued increase in headline inflation 
 During part of 2002 or 
in early 2003, the Czech 
Republic, Lithuania and Malta experienced falling 

consumer prices on an annu
al basis, while in Estonia 
and Poland annual price increases were below 1%.  As 
money supply and credit growth remained in general 
resilient, falling prices are in general not due to a lack 

of demand, but rather to better supply side conditions 
driven by strong productivity gains and enhanced 
competition.   

 Also this year, average in
flation at 2.4% (private 
consumption deflator) is expect
ed to remain close to the 
levels observed in the euro area, but in 2004, an 

acceleration to 3.5% is fore
seen, slowing down to 3.1%

 in 2005.  Driving these developments are the 
liberalisation of administrative prices and a hike of 
indirect taxes.  Underlying inflation should remain 

subdued as pressures from relatively strong wage 
increases (on average 5.7% over the forecast period) 
due to catching up with EU 
levels are compensated by productivity growth (around 3% on average in the 
forecast period) so that the 
rise in unit labour costs 
remains limited.  
 Current account deficits remain high 
 The average current account deficit is forecast to stay 
around 4¾% of GDP during the forecast period.  This is 

the combined result of the correction of too high 
deficits in Slovakia (about 8% of GDP in 2002) and 
Estonia (about 15% of GDP in 2003) and a slightly 

rising deficit in Poland (3.6% of GDP in 2005) and 
Latvia (9.6% of GDP in 2005).  Deficits remain 
relatively high with little adjustment in the Czech 
Republic and Hungary (more than 6% of GDP in 2003-
05), but also in Malta and Lithuania. 
 Six countries are likely to ha
ve deficits in excess of 
3% of GDP in 2003 
 The average general government deficit in the acceding 
countries is estimated to be 
about 5% of GDP in 2003.  
Only Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia are 
expected to remain below the threshold of 3% of GDP.  
While representing a small d
ecline compared to 2002, 
when the average general g
overnment deficit reached 
5.2% of GDP, it falls short in most acceding countries 
of the targets that governments fixed for this year in the 
Pre-Accession Economic Programmes submitted in 
August 2003, as growth disappointed and the fiscal 
stance was loosened.   

 With the improvement of the economic situation and a 
tightening of fiscal policy in some countries, the 

average general government deficit is expected to 
decline to 4.1% in 2005.  Only in Poland is a sharp 
deterioration of the deficit expected, from 4.3% of GDP 

in 2003 to 5.9% of GDP in 2004, while Lithuania is 
expected to join in 2004 the countries with deficits 
above 3% of GDP.

76304978 European Economy1. Cyprus  Positive growth but hit hard by inte
rnational tension and weak EU growth The economy in 2002 
 Due to low EU growth and international tension, tourist 

arrivals fell steeply in 2002. However, Cyprus still 
managed GDP growth of 2% that year, supported by 
moderate domestic demand. At the same time, fiscal 

policy slipped, turning more expansionary. 
Consumption growth remained modest at 2.5%, in line 
with moderate wage growth and weak consumer 

confidence, but supported by an increase in disposable 
income linked to tax reform and continuing full-
employment conditions. Investment increased by 10%, 
partly stimulated by interest rate reductions to counter 
the external demand shock, but also included purchases 

of ships/aircraft.  
 Strongly hit by international developments, exports 

dropped by more than 5% mostly due to a sharp 
decrease in tourist arrivals 
of 10%. Imports declined 
marginally as a result of lower exports and the domestic 
demand deceleration. Overall 
this widened the current 
account deficit to 5.3% of GDP.  
 Prospects 
 For 2003, the forecas
t projects modest real GDP growth 
of 2%, pushed by domestic demand. For 2004 a 
rebound to 3.4% is expected, increasing in strength in 
2005 as external demand 
picks up while domestic 
private demand remains the driving force.  
 The economy, with tourism 
as a mainstay, has shown 
some resilience in the face of
 a difficult international environment. Economic imbalances have increased, but 
prospects are for a slow re
turn to more sustainable 
levels.  
 Costs and prices 
 Prices in 2002 and 2003 were mainly pushed by higher 

VAT taxation related to the EU accession. Inflation 
reached 2.8% in 2002 and ra
n at 6.3% y-o-y by March 
2003 before easing to 2.4% by August. For the year, 
inflation is expected to peak at 4.3%, but then to fall 
back to 2% for the remaining forecast period.  
 The Central Bank has achieved 
a solid track record on 
containing inflation and keeping the pound stable vis-à-
vis the euro. Monetary policy followed the subdued 
economic activity and this led, together with stricter 
credit risk assessment applied by banks, to declining 

growth rates in money supply and lower interest rates in 
2002. Annual money supply (M2) growth in early 2003 
decelerated further to 9% in
 April 2003. At the same 
time, the Cyprus pound remained stable against the euro 
in 2002 and in the course of 2003. 
 GDP components 
 Private consumption growth for 2003 is expected to 

remain below 3%, subsequently picking up as consumer 
confidence restores. However, modest increases in 
earnings and a shift of the tax burden to consumption 

will limit consumption expansion. For this year, 
investment is foreseen to decline by 4.5%, although 
when corrected for ships and aircraft purchases last 
year, growth would still be above 4% on an annual 
basis. For the remainder of the period, investment 

should rebound; factors stimulating investment are still 
in place, such as EU accession, liberalisation in 
financial and utilities markets, and planned 

infrastructure projects (air
ports in Larnaca and Paphos 
and a port in Larnaca). 

 
In the first half of 2003 the decline in tourist arrivals 
continued, linked to the Iraq war and SARS. Tourism 
arrivals now look to decrease by 5%. Arrivals are 

expected to revive gradually in 2004-5, in line with 
historical experience but also reflecting the global recovery and positive spill-over of the 2004 Olympic 

Games in Athens. Export growth is therefore projected 
to increase to above 5%. Impo
rt growth remains almost 
nil in 2003 as domestic demand growth slows down, 
but is foreseen to pick up in line with the resumption in 
export and domestic demand expansion but curbed by

Acceding Countries, Cyprus ad hoc factors such as a fall in defence equipment 
imports. The current account deficit is therefore 
projected downward from a deficit of 5.3% of GDP in 

2002 to 2.8% by 2005. 
 Labour market 
 With unemployment rates at around 3.5%, Cyprus does 
not have an unemployment problem. The labour market 

is relatively flexible while imported seasonal labour 
also takes some of the strain in some labour market 
segments. Despite lower growth, the unemployment 
rate decreased to about 3½% in 2002 and is expected to 
increase marginally in 2003 
before falling back again, 
as GDP growth picks up.  
 Public finances 
 The fiscal consolidation programme slipped as the 

deficit climbed to 3.5% of GDP in 2002. The 
programme was abandoned in 2003 due to the 
economic slowdown, increa
sed defence outlays, and 
expansionary expenditure measures introduced to offset 
subdued external demand. For 2003 the deficit is now
 projected to sharply rise 
to above 5% of GDP. To 
counter this slippage, the
 government adopted a new 
consolidation programme. 
The forecast sets for a 
gradually declining -but still relatively high- deficit of 

about 3% by 2005.

  78304978 European Economy2. Czech Republic  Deteriorating public finances 
The economy in 2002 and 
the first half of 2003 
 In 2002, real GDP growth was 2.0% despite the August 

floods, the strengthened national currency and sluggish 
external demand. The main driving force of economic 
growth was domestic consumption. Household 

consumption grew by 4% and government consumption 
by 5.7%. Fixed investment grew by a disappointing 
0.6%. 

 In the first half of 2003, 
the performance of the Czech 
economy remained solid, 
even with a difficult 
economic environment. GDP growth reached 2.3%, 
being mostly driven by household consumption which 

grew by 5%. This growth was mainly due to the 
combination of high real increase in disposable income 
and of low nominal interest rates that enabled an 

expansion of consumer credit. The growth rate of gross 
fixed capital formation was 
negative (-0.3%). Although 
exports expressed in current koruna prices went up by 
7.9% in the first half of 2003, imports also increased 
(by 7.3%) and net exports made a negative contribution 
to GDP growth (Œ1.6 percentage points).
  Growth prospects 
 The immediate outlook for the Czech economy is for 
moderate economic growth for the rest of 2003, leading 

to an annual growth rate of 2.2%. The growth 

composition should basically stay the same as in the 
first half of the year Œ domestic consumption having a 
positive impact and gross fixed capital formation and 
net exports having a negative contribution to GDP 
growth. 
Growth prospects for 2004 and 2005 largely depend on 
the degree of economic recovery in the EU, in 
particular in Germany. They will also be influenced by 

the recently adopted fiscal 
consolidation package. The 
GDP growth rate is predicted to accelerate and to reach 
2.6% in 2004 and 3.3% in 2005. Due to increases in 

indirect taxes, household consumption is projected to 
decelerate in 2004 and to 
increase somewhat again in 
2005, in line with the assumed economic recovery. Due 
to cuts in government expenditures, government 
consumption will decrease in 2004 and increase only 
slightly in 2005. Gross fixed capital formation is 
expected to increase. Net 
exports are projected to 
remain a negative growth contributor.  
 Inflation  In the first half of 2003
, the Czech Republic faced a 
new phenomenon Œ falling pri
ces. From January to May 
2003, the annual increase in the harmonised index of 

consumer prices remained slightly negative; in June 
2003, the annual increase was zero, and in July it turned 
negative again. For the whole period, the monetary 

authorities were undershooting the inflation target. This 
undershooting was mainly a result of an unexpected 
disinflationary effect of the external environment, in 

particular by a lower-than-expected increase in food 
and regulated prices and by 
the stronger exchange rate 
of the koruna. 
 At the end of 2003, HICP inflation is expected to 
remain zero. In 2004, inflation is likely to increase to 
3.3% on average, mainly as a consequence of higher 
indirect taxes. Thereafter, 
the annual HICP is expected 
to come down to 2.6% in 2005, assuming that second-
round effects of indirect tax increases are kept under 
control.
  Labour market  
 The labour market was affected by the ongoing 
restructuring of the Czech economy. The rate of 
unemployment was 7.3% at the end of 2002, going up 

slightly afterwards (7.6% in the first quarter of 2003). 
In addition to the restructuring process, unemployment 
will be affected by the pub
lic finance reform, according 
to which 2% of public sector employees should be 
dismissed annually over the period 2004-2006.

Acceding Countries, Czech Republic 
The ILO survey-based unempl
oyment rate is expected to increase to 7.8% at the end of 2003 and to reach 
8.1% in 2004. Afterwards, it is projected to fall slightly 

to 8.0% in 2005. 
 Current account 
 The trade balance is expected to deteriorate slightly in 
2003 as a consequence of high domestic consumption 

and of the economic slowdown in the EU, mainly in 
Germany. The small improvement in the trade balance 
in 2004 will mainly reflect lower imports due to the 
public finance reform which will negatively affect 
domestic demand. The worsening in 2005 will be a 

consequence of increasing investments, which are 
import intensive. After the deterioration in 2002, the 
surplus in the balance of serv
ices as percentage of GDP 
is expected to remain constant in 2003 and 2004 (1% of 
GDP) and to improve slightly in 2005. The income 
balance  should  worsen  in  2004  as  profits  of foreign  

   investors are expected to be repatriated, which is 
partially linked to the effort of EU-based companies to 
improve their balance sheets. As a result, the current 

account deficit should increase 
to 6.9% of GDP in 2004 
and then to decrease to 6.6% of GDP. 
 Public finances 
 According to ESA95 data communicated by the Czech 
authorities, the general government deficit in 2002 
reached 7.1% of GDP Œ reflecting partly high 
expenditures in the election year and capital transfers to 
the Czech Consolidation Ag
ency. Gross public debt 
was 27.1% of GDP. 
In 2003, the general government deficit is projected to 
worsen further and to reach 8.0% of GDP and then to 
improve to 6.3% of GDP in 2004 and 5.2% of GDP in 
2005 as a consequence of 
fiscal reform. Gross public 
debt is expected to increase from 30.7% of GDP in 
2003 to 38.3% of GDP in 2005.

80304978 European Economy3. Estonia  Strong domestic demand, and a weak 
external environment, will exacerbate 
the current account deficit in 2003 Real GDP is expected to grow by some 4½% in 2003, 
and close to potential in 2004-05.  Strong domestic 
demand will be the main source of growth in 2003, and 

to a lesser extent in 2004. As the contribution from 
domestic demand gradually abates a steady 
improvement in the external environment will maintain 

the economy's momentum. Consequently the current 
account deficit is forecast to 
narrow to some 8½ % in 
2005.  The general government budget is forecast to 
remain balanced on a yearly basis, although slippages at 
the local government level could result in a small deficit 
in 2004. 
The economy in 2002 
GDP growth of some 6% in 2002 was underpinned by 
buoyant private consumption and investment growth,  

driven by low interest rates, and strong wage and 
employment growth. A mismatch between domestic 
and foreign demand was manifested in a robust demand 

for imports (10.2% increase in 2002), and a relatively 
sluggish export performance (6% increase in 2002), and 
resulted in a deterioration of the current account deficit 

to some 12.3% of GDP in 2002. CPI inflation receded 
to 2.7% by end-2002 owing to exchange rate 
movements, and other temporary factors (e.g., food 

prices). Labour market conditions continued to improve 
and, according to the labour force survey, the 
unemployment rate declined to 10.3% of the labour 
force in 2002.  The general government surplus 
increased to around 1% of
 GDP mainly on account of 
buoyant growth, and despite additional spending of 
some 1.1% of GDP approved by the parliament in two 
supplementary budgets. 
GDP components
  Monetary conditions will remain favourable during 
2003, and domestic demandŠparticularly private 

consumption which is forecast to grow by 6.5%Šwill 
continue to be the main source of growth. Fixed 
investment growth will decel
erate from 16.1% in 2002 
to 12% in 2003, as enterprises cut back on investment 
spending and the effects of one-off investment projects 
dissipate. However, as the current monetary policy 

cycle in the eurozone unw
inds in 2004-05 and the 
external environment impr
oves further, tighter 
monetary conditions and a gradual increase in the 
savings of households and firms will restraint domestic 
demand, turning the contribution from net exports 

positive. Hence, the forecast for 2004-05 envisages a 
more balanced growth outlook given weaker domestic 
demandŠwhich is forecast to grow by 5.3% and 4% in 

2004 and 2005 respectively,
 compared with 8% in 
2002Š, and the steady impr
ovement in the external 
outlook. Accordingly, real GD
P is expected to grow at 
around 5-5½ %, or close to potential in 2004-05.  
Costs and prices 
Inflation dynamics in Estonia have mirrored 
developments in the EU in recent years, although higher 

oil prices and a depreciating euro contributed to an 
acceleration of inflation to 
almost 7% in mid-2001. 
Inflationary pressures receded subsequently and CPI 
inflation decelerated to 2.
7% by end-2002, while the 
differential with the euro ar
ea narrowed to less than ½ 
percentage point. The drop in inflation toward the end 

of the year, and during the first half of 2003, was due to 
temporary factors. Hence, the forecast envisages a pick-
up in inflation in the second half of 2003, and during 
2004. Additionally, a number of measures including 
tax, and administered price, hikes will contribute to 

higher prices and inflation 
is forecast to reach 4% in 
2004, although is expected to fall slightly thereafter to 

3.7% in 2005. 
Labour Market 
In spite of a strong growth performance, and sizeable 
employment gains since 2001, the unemployment 
rateŠwhich remains at ar
ound 10% of the labour 
forceŠis forecast to decline only slightly in the 
medium term to around 9% of the labour force. 
Moderate employment gains will contribute to the 

decline in the unemployment rate, although 
considerable skills mismatch will hold back a faster 
improvement in labour market conditions

Acceding Countries, Estonia Balance of payments 
The global economic slowdown, and in particular the 
ensuing slump in the telecommunication sector, led to a 
dramatic deceleration in Esto
nia's export growth since 
mid-2001. The delayed recovery in the EU is having its 
impact on demand for exports for Estonian goods which 
are forecast to grow by 5% in 2003. At the same time, 
imports are expected to incr
ease by 9% and the current 
account deficit is consequen
tly expected to widen to 
15.2% in 2003. As the recovery in the EU gathers 

momentum, export growth in Estonia is forecast to 
gradually accelerate to 10% in 2004, and some 12% by 
2005. Import growth will be less buoyant in 2004 partly 

as a result of the high level of imports in 2003 (and 
hence base effects), and weaker investment activity. As 
the external environment improves further, and 

investment activity recovers, demand for imports both 
for consumer goods and for intermediate inputs will 
accelerate to 10% in 2005. Consequently, the 
contribution of net exports is forecast to become 
positive, and the current account deficit narrow to 8.5% 
of GDP by 2005. 
Public finances 
Fiscal discipline and a better than expected growth 
performance both contributed to an increase in the 
general government surplus, from ½% of GDP in 2001 
to around 1¼% of GDP in 2002. Windfall revenues of 

some 1.4% of GDP also led to a significant increase in 
government spending by 0.7% of GDP compared to the 
2003 budget. Local governments continued to be a 

drain on public finances, with significant budget 
slippages in 2002, and projected expenditure overruns 
for 2003. In 2004, plans for tax cuts could put pressure 
of public finances, particularly at the central 
government level, although projected higher cyclical 

tax revenues, and strict expe
nditure control will offset 
some of the revenue losses. Several other tax changes, 

mostly for accession to the EU, will also provide 

additional revenues in 2004. Expenditure slippages at 
the local government level could, however, result in a 
small general government deficit in 2004.

82304978 European Economy4. Hungary  Re-balancing the economy 
 The economy in 2003  
 The overall macro-economic equilibrium of the 
Hungarian economy has deteriorated since 2002. In a 
difficult external environment, but supported by a 

strong demand-side stimulus, GDP grew by 3.3% in 
2002. During the first half of 2003, the growth rate 
decreased to 2.6% year-on-
year. Following last year™s 
exceptionally high budget deficit, fiscal policy was 
significantly tightened in 2003. Coupled with unstable 
monetary and exchange rate policies, the forint suffered 

greater volatility, and risk premiums have risen sharply. 
The exporting industry, including foreign tourism, 
suffered from declining external demand which until 
January 2003 was combined with a strong appreciation 
of the currency. As a conse
quence, the external balance 
has started to deteriorate in 2002, with a current account deficit of 4% of GDP in 2002. Investment (FDI) 

decreased markedly 
in 2002, to 1.8% of GDP, with a 
further deterioration of this trend in the first half of 
2003. As a result, there was a net outflow of capital 
over the first half of 2003, and the current account 

deficit is financed exclusiv
ely through th
e increase in 
net external debt.  

 Prospects 
 The immediate outlook for 
the Hungarian economy is 
for a relatively moderate growth rate in 2003 of 2.9%, 
assuming an upswing in the s
econd half of the year. On 
the basis of an assumed rec
overy in the EU Œ Hungary™s 
main trading partner Œ growth
 is expected to accelerate 
to 3.2% in 2004 and further to 3.4% in 2005. In both 
years a continuation of relatively strong domestic 

demand, continued public investment in infrastructure 
and a combination of recovering exports and foreign 

tourism are expected to be th
e driving forces of growth.  
 GDP components  
 Private consumption in the first half of 2003 expanded 
more rapidly than GDP growth, and is expected to be 

9.8% in 2003, while growth in investment will remain 
nearly flat. Private consump
tion is expected to slow 
down in 2004 to 4.0% due to more moderate wage 

developments, while increasing again somewhat at the 
end of the forecasting period 
to 4.6%, in line with the 
economic recovery. 
 The net export contribution is expected to remain 

negative over the entire fo
recast period, but on a 
gradually improving trend, in line with growing 

external demand. Imports are expected to grow around 

a rate of 7-8% throughout 2004 and 2005, given the 
high import contribution contained in Hungarian 
exports along with continuing demand for private 

consumption. 
 Costs and prices 
 The disinflation of the recent
 years came to a halt in the 
first half of 2003. Inflation is expected to increase 
somewhat over the second 
half of 2003, thereafter 
reaching an annual average 
of 4.6%. The increase is 
expected to be the result of the weaker exchange rate, 

the proposed increase of regulated prices and measures 
aimed at reducing the excess supply of foodstuffs. In 
2004, a temporary increase to
 6.1% on average can be 
expected, due to the deregula
tion of administered prices 
and the expected one-off upw
ard pressure on the price 
level caused by the projected changes to indirect taxes. 
Thereafter, average CPI infla
tion is expected to come 
down to 4.1% in 2005. 
 With the economy slowly adapting to the new low-

inflation environment, wage developments in 2003 have 
started to be more moderate from their previously high 
growth rates, especially 
in the corporate sector. 
 Nevertheless, also in 2003 real wage growth at around 
13% continues to exceed pr
oductivity growth by a 
considerable margin. Real
 wages are expected to 
become more in line with productivity increases, 

slowing down to 8.0% in 2002 and 6.7% in 2005.

Acceding Countries, Hungary Labour market  
 Although the unemployment ra
te temporarily increased 
to over 6% in the first half of 2003, the labour market in 
the skilled segment and in the industrialised regions of 
the country remains tight, while participation rates 

continue to be very low. During the June to August 
2003 period, the ILO unemployment rate was down to 
5.7%. Overall unemployment is expected to stabilise 

around this level over the forecasting period. 
 Public finances  
 For 2003, the government is aiming at a deficit target 

below 5% of GDP, which would represent a turnaround  
  after the strong fiscal expansion of 2002. Consequently, 
the general government deficit is on a downward trend, 
following a redirection of fiscal policy since 2003. In 

late September 2003, a tight budget for 2004 was 
adopted by the government. This austerity programme 
addresses some structural problems on the revenue and 

expenditure side of the Hungarian budget. Budget 
deficits in ESA 95 terms are forecast at 5.4% of GDP in 
2003, 4.4% in 2004 and 3.6% in 2005. The debt of the 

general government, which currently stands at 56.3% of 
GDP is expected to increase further to 57.9% of GDP in 
2003, before gradually coming down to 56.9% in 2004 
and to 55.5% in 2005.

84304978 European Economy5. Latvia  Strong consumption and large current account deficit 
Activity in 2002 and prospects 
 In 2002, Latvian economic activity has remained firm 
despite a weak external environment. GDP growth 
remained strong at 6.1% in
 2002 and accelerated further 
to 7.5% in the first half of 2003 year-on-year. GDP 
growth was slower in the second quarter of the year 
than in the first quarter (6
.2% and 8.8% over the same 
periods in 2002, respectively). Private consumption and 
gross fixed capital formation were particularly robust 
and became the driving 
factors for growth.  
 GDP components  
 Private consumption is expect
ed to continue to show 
healthy, but slightly lower, growth rates in 2003 
compared to 2002
 (6.7% and 6% respectively), as 
disposable income is set to increase slightly less and 

inflation remains at a relatively high level. In 2004 and 

2005, private consumption is
 expected to grow at a 
slightly lower pace of 5%. Ov
erall investment growth is 
likely to remain high at 9.5% in 2004 and 2005. 

Housing investment is increasing over the entire 
forecast period. The large depletion of stocks in 2002 
should come to an end, but no significant contribution 

to GDP growth from stocks is
 expected in both forecast 
years. 
 
The outlook for the Latvian economy is for a strong 
growth rate in 2003 of 6%, declining slightly to 5.7% in 
2005. In both years final domestic demand is expected 

to be driving growth, prim
arily led by increases in 
private consumption on the back of sustained increases 
in real disposable income and better credit access. Fixed 
investment growth will remain high at 9.5% throughout 
the forecast period. External demand will continue to be 

important for growth. The recovery of the EU economy 
and a further assumed depreciation of the lat against the 
euro will keep export growth strong. Import growth is 

expected to slow down but to remain robust, allowing 
for a narrowing of the trade balance. Thus, for 2005 the 
contribution from net exports will have recovered to -.4 

percentage points from Œ1.5 percentage points in 2003. 
Accordingly, real GDP is expected to grow at around 5.5%, or close to potentia
l in both forecast years. 
 Costs and prices 
 Despite high private consumption growth, inflation 
decreased to 2% in 2002, as inflation in Latvia™s major 
trading partners was low and lower prices in mobile 
communication services helped to contain domestic 

price pressures. Inflation has picked up and reached 
3.5% in August 2003. The sh
arpest rise was seen by 
health care costs. Costs of recreation and culture, 
housing and public utilities and foodstuffs have 
increased with only costs of
 the communications edging 
lower. 
 Inflation is expected to grow steadily and stabilise at 
3% during the forecast period. Inflation will increase 

due to the expected adjustment of the price level to the 
EU level and due to wage increases. From 2004, an 
increase in excise duties on fuel and petrol is planned to 

be implemented Œ thus, the inflation rate is expected to 
increase due to this factor 
as well. However, the full 
impact of the effect of the increase will only be visible 

in the second half of 2004 and 2005, where inflation is 
set to increase more rapidly. Core inflation is, however, 

not expected to increase 
markedly over the forecast 
horizon.
  Labour market  
 High growth has contributed to lowering the 

unemployment rate, which decreased from 12.8% in 
December 2001 to 11.6% in December 2002, and the 
employment rate was 60.4% in 2002. However, upward 

pressure on unemployment from enterprise and rural 
restructuring is expected to remain.

forceŠis forecast to decline only slightly in the 
medium term to around 11% of the labour force. 
Moderate employment gains of 0.5% per year over the 

forecast period will contribu
te to the decline in the 
unemployment rate, although considerable regional 

development disparities will hold back a faster 

improvement in labour market conditions. 
 The current account
  Export growth in 2002 was very strong despite the 
international slowdown, and imports grew somewhat 
less than exports. Also, in the beginning of 2003 trade 
continued to be buoyant. Exports increased by 19.2% in 

the first half of 2003 over the same period last year 
while imports increased by 20.4%.  
 
Exports are expected to grow by 9.4% on average in 
2003, slightly decreasing to 9.0% in 2004 and 2005. 

Imports should grow broadly in line with final demand, 

resulting in a small negative contribution to GDP 
growth from net exports in both years. 
The current account deficit d
ecreased to 7.8% of GDP 
in 2002. As the trade balance is expected to worsen, this 
will result in a broadening of
 the current account deficit 
by about 2 percentage points during the forecast period. 
 Public finances 
 A sudden and large increas
e of public expenditures 
related to investment and temporary transfers at the 
very end of 2002 let the budget deficit increase to 3% of 
GDP. According to the budget for 2003, the general 
government deficit was planned to be 3% of GDP. 
However, better then expected tax revenues in the first 
two quarters of the year indicate that a somewhat 

smaller deficit is possible. In 2004, a broadening of the 
VAT base and the real estate tax base will outweigh the 
intended cut in the corporate income tax. Consequently, 

the deficit is expected to ap
proach 2% of GDP in 2005.

  86304978 European Economy6. Lithuania  Strong domestic demand to continue as the leading factor for growth The economy  
 In spite of a weak external 
environment, the Lithuanian 
economy remained particularly strong in 2002 and the 
first half of 2003
. Real GDP continued to grow unabated in 2002, reaching 6.7%, and accelerated 

further to 7.7% year-on-year in the first half of 2003. 

Output growth was particularly supported by strong 
investment and private consumption. Despite robust 
export growth in 2002, the contribution of net trade to 

GDP growth was moderate, as imports also picked up 
strongly. The current account 
deficit increased slightly 
to 5.4% of GDP in 2002. Strong productivity growth, 

moderate wage inflation, and the large appreciation of 
the litas contributed to low CPI inflation, at 0.3% in 

2002. Consumer prices followed a decreasing trend in 
2003 and declined by 1% in
 August compar
ed with the 
same month of 2002. The unemployment rate (Labour 
Force Survey data) decreased
 from 17.4% in 2001 to 
13.8% in 2002, underpinned by high employment 

growth. The authorities remained committed to the 

fiscal consolidation prog
ramme, and accordingly the 
general government deficit declined further to 1.7% of 

GDP in 2002.  

 Prospects 
 Output growth is expected to remain robust throughout 
the forecast horizon, in a 
range of 5.7%-6.6%. The 
pattern of GDP growth is expected to be continuously
 influenced by Lithuania™s accession to the EU, which 

primarily affects the outlook for gross fixed capital 
formation, government expenditure and net trade. 
In the face of increasing i
nvestment and consumption, 
domestic demand is expected to remain the leading 

factor for growth. The prospect for import growth, in 
the wake of robust domestic demand, is likely to offset 

an anticipated strong export 
performance, leading to a 
negative contribution of net trade to growth in 2004 and 

2005. 

 GDP components  
 Private consumption is likely to grow rapidly at around 
5% over the forecast period
, sustained by real wage 
increases and high credit growth. Higher employment 

and increasing government expenditure are also 
expected to stimulate consumption. 
Public consumption is projected to grow considerably 
in 2004 and 2005, partly reflecting expenditure in goods 
and services related to proj
ects co-financed by the EU. 
A higher public wage bill is also expected, to some 
extent reflecting a build up in administrative capacity 
for absorption of EU funds within the public sector. 
Gross fixed capital formation is expected to continue as 
the main source of output growth. Investment growth is 
expected to moderate somewhat this year at 8.1%, 
edging up to 8.7% by 2005. Higher investment is likely 

to be supported by EU-related investment projects, 
together with low interest rates, increasing domestic 
lending and enhanced economic stability.   

 The strong appreciating trend of the litas experienced in 
2002 and most of 2003 is expected to moderate in 

2004-2005. This fact, together with a more benign 
outlook for growth in Lithuania™s trading partners, is 
foreseen to increase foreign demand for Lithuania™s 
exports. Domestic factors, such as high productivity 
growth and structural reforms, should contribute further 

to strong export growth at 
above 7% over the forecast 
horizon. Nonetheless, import growth is likely to remain 

robust, reflecting high domestic demand, and lead to a 

negative contribution of net trade to growth in 2004 
and, more marginally, in 2005. 
 Inflation  Annual average CPI inflation is expected to be negative 
in 2003, to a large extent 
reflecting the effect of the 
appreciation of the litas. Inflation is expected to 
increase significantly to ab
out 2.5% in 2004-2005, 
initially influenced by accession-related tax 

adjustments. Other factors could add further pressures 

on prices, such as wage inflation in the tradable sector

Acceding Countries, Lithuania 
spilling over to the low-productivity non-tradable sector 
and price hikes among regulated sectors and public 
transport. Accordingly, wage pressures are likely to 

increase, although the estimated productivity growth 
level should temper the impact on unit labour costs. 
 Labour market  
 The unemployment rate (survey based data) is expected 
to decrease over the forecast 
period from 13% in 2003 
to 10.7% in 2005. Job creation is likely to continue 

increasing, induced by high
er economic activity, active 
labour market policies and the increase in the retirement 

age. Significant structural rigidities in the labour market 

are expected to remain 
in the medium-term, and 
constitutes a risk for the projections.  

 
   
 In particular, measures to 
tackle the mismatch between 
demand and supply of skills and the low mobility of the 

workforce could take a longer
 time than expected to 
feed through, resulting on an insufficient capacity to 
offset potential job losses stemming from enterprise and 
agricultural restructuring. 

 Public finances  
 The general government deficit is expected to edge up 
to 3.1% of GDP in 2004, from 1.7% of GDP in 2002. 
High public investment grow
th, together with current 
expenditure in the form of contributions to the EU 

budget and prepayments of 
agricultural subsidies, are 
expected to increase the deficit in 2004. The deficit is 
expected to decline again 
to 2.7% of GDP in 2005, 
assuming that control over expenditure continues.

88304978 European Economy7. Malta  Public finances looser 
 The economy in 2002 
 The difficult international environment continued to 

unfavourably affect Malta™s economy, particularly 
vulnerable to external economic and geopolitical shocks 
given its small size, large dependence on tourism 

revenues and the increasingly open nature of its 
economy.   
 
Weak external demand, stemming from the world 
economic slowdown, and a fall in tourist arrivals hit the 
Maltese economy in 2001 and 2002. After the 
contraction in real GDP in
 2001, real GDP grew by 
1.2% in 2002, led by a recovery in private and 
government consumption, both having grown 2.5% in 
real terms. Despite the increase in investment in the 
construction sector of 7.4%, retrenchment of 10.1% in 

investment in the machinery sector resulted in a 4% 
drop in  gross fixed capital formation in 2002.  
 
The external sector impr
oved slightly, exports 
marginally increasing by 0.2% and imports falling  by 

2.2% in 2002. The curren
t account deficit remained 
stable at 4.7% of GDP. The 
rate of inflation decelerated to 2.2% in 2002. The inflation pass-through of the 

depreciation of the Maltese 
lira against the euro was moderate because domestic demand was subdued. The 
unemployment rate increased to 6.8% in December 
2002. Developments in th
e private sector largely 
explain the increase, as low activity in tourism and 
industrial restructuring in manufacturing  accounted  for  

  significant job losses. The general government deficit 
decreased to 6.2% of GDP in 2002 from 6.8% in 2001, 
but remains well above the levels previously estimated 

by the government. As a result, the debt ratio increased 
to 64.2% of GDP, from 62% of GDP in 2001.  
 Prospects 
 The economic situation at the beginning of 2003 

deteriorated compared to the end of last year, and 
remarkably high public consumption could offer only a 
partial compensation. Growth in the first quarter 
contracted by 1.6% but expanded by 0.9% in the second 
quarter (q-o-q) driven by high gross fixed capital 

formation and government expenditure. This trend is 
estimated to consolidate in the second half of the year. 
An important driving force is the expected gradual 

recovery of the technological 
sector in the United States 
and in Asia that may positively affect exports. 

Furthermore higher tourism earnings in the summer and 

strong growth of public expenditure related to the 
construction sector will positively affect growth. 
Underlying the projection for the Maltese economy is a 

progressive, albeit slow, resumption of real GDP 
growth as efforts for deeper structural reforms and 
consolidation of public finances and debt reduction 

could weight on economic activity in the short term. 
Accordingly, real GDP growth 
is expected to go up to 
0.8% in 2003 and 2.7% and 2.9% in 2004 and 2005 
respectively, mostly supported by exports of goods and 
services and gross fixed capital formation. 
 GDP components  
 Domestic impulses are likely 
to weaken as growth in 
household consumption is projected to remain below 

the rates observed in 2
001 and 2002, because real 
wages per head and real disposable income are 
expected to increase only moderately over the period. 
After a sharp rise in public consumption in 2003, this 

component is expected to dramatically slowdown in 
2004 and 2005, in order to bring public deficit under 
control. The main contribution to the recovery should 

come from improvements in 
the external sector, where 
exports, after an expected re
vival to 2.5% in 2003 , are 
forecast to increase by 3.5% and 3.9% in 2004 and 

2005. Fixed investment, albeit at lower levels than 
previously  due to lower levels of public capital 
expenditure, is estimated to remain growing at close to     

3% in 2004-2005.

89304978 European EconomyChapter 4 
Acceding Countries, Malta Costs and prices 
 Consumer price inflation is expected to stay below 2% 

over the period provided wage moderation, especially 
in the public sector, is maintained. Due to the 
underlying assumptions for world primary commodity 

prices, oil prices and the exch
ange rate of the euro, the 
contribution of imported inflation to consumer price 

increases is expected to remain at the low risk side. 

 Labour market  
 Employment growth of  0.4% is expected in 2003 and 
2004, but a doubling to 0.8% is foreseen by the end of 

the forecast period. The survey-based rate of 
unemployment is predicted to decline to 7% in 2003 
and further improve over the period, due to job creation 

in manufacturing and tourism sectors which will offset 
the effects of continued downsizing in the public sector 
enterprises. Public finances  
 The fiscal policy stance has l
oosened considerably this 
year. The general government deficit will likely further 
deteriorate to 7.6% of GDP in 2003, stemming from 
lower than expected GDP growth in 2003 and mounting  

public expenditure linked to outlays connected with the 
new Mater Dei Hospital,  and high mandatory and quasi 
mandatory expenditures. The 
expected budgetary  path 
relies, not only heavily on developments in GDP 
growth, the effects of population ageing and the 
requirement of co-financing of EU funds, but also on 
the government's ability to effectively slowdown public 
expenditure. In line with this
 evolution, the forecast is 
for a general government deficit of 5.8% in 2004 and 
4.1% in 2005. As a result, the general government gross 
debt ratio is estimated to attain 66.4% of GDP in 2003 

and will likely reach 69.4% in
 2004 and 70.6% of GDP 
in 2005.

90304978 European Economy8. Poland  Accelerating growth amidst fis
cal and labour market difficulties 
Current situation and prospects 
Poland is experiencing a 
gradual recovery after two 
years of slow growth.  Real
 GDP growth accelerated to 
3.8% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2003 from 
2.2% in the first quarter. So far, the recovery has been 
mainly driven by net exports, despite weak growth in 

Poland's main trading partners. Private consumption, 
although growing moderately, has also continued to 
support GDP growth. Rapid expansion in industrial 

production and retail sales from July to September 
suggests that th
e pace of growth remained sustained in 
the third quarter of 2003. The current recovery is helped 

by an accommodating fiscal po
licy and more favourable 
monetary conditions, resulting from the easing of 
monetary policy and the sharp depreciation of the real 
effective exchange rate.  
Real GDP growth is project
ed to accelerate gradually 
from 3.3% in 2003 to 4.8% in 2005. Growth will be 
supported by domestic demand, while the contribution 
of net exports will turn negative from 2004 onwards. 
Boosted by increasing corporate profits, an improving 

economic outlook and accession to the EU, investment 
is expected to become the driving force of domestic 
demand in 2004. In addition, the loosening of fiscal 

policy next year will provide an impetus to growth. 
 GDP components 
After the sharp decline of the past two years,
 investment is expected to start growing again in the 
second half of 2003, reflecting improving company 

profitability. However, the recession in the construction 
sector and still difficult financing conditions for firms 
will limit the recovery in investment activity this year. 

As the business climate improves, investment growth 
will gradually gain momentum and is projected to 

reach, in volume term
s, 11.5% in 2005.  
Private consumption is expected to remain relatively 

strong in 2003 despite rising unemployment. Higher 

than planned increases in social transfers and wages in 

real terms as well as a vigorous grey economy will 
support household spending this year. Growing 
consumer confidence and th
e increase in employment 
should lead to faster cons
umer spending in 2004 and 
2005. Export growth is expected to remain robust, 

helped by the real effective 
depreciation of the zloty in 
2003 and the productivity gains of Polish companies. 

Import growth will rise in parallel with the acceleration 

of domestic demand and is projected to outpace export 
growth in 2005. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2003, the rise in unemployment will reflect both 
demographic factors and a drop in employment. 

Significant job losses will be associated with continued 

enterprise restructuring, notably in agriculture and in 
the coal mining and steel sect
ors. A modest increase in 
employment is expected in 
2004 and 2005 as economic 
activity gathers momentum. However, the 

unemployment rate would start decreasing only in 
2005. 
Inflationary pressures will remain subdued in 2003, as 
domestic demand remains weak and high 
unemployment restrains wage pressures. As a result, 

headline inflation at the end of 2003 will likely 
undershoot the lower band of the target range set by the 
Polish National Bank (3% +/- 1%).
 The forecast 
foresees a gradual increase in inflation from the very 

low level of 0.7% on average in 2003 to 2.7% in 2005.
 The inflationary push will 
come from the acceleration 
of domestic demand, the pass-through of the currency 

depreciation and a small infla
tionary effect of accession 
linked to tax increases.   
 External accounts The current account deficit is set to narrow further this 
year as a result of strong export growth and weak 

imports. The recovery should entail a gradual widening 
of the current account deficit from 2.9% of GDP in 
2003 to 3.6% in 2005. Higher transfers from the EU 

will contribute to limiting the deterioration of the 
current account balance in 2004 and 2005.

the forecast horizon, the current account deficit will 
remain at levels that can be easily financed by foreign 
direct investment and portfolio inflows.  

 Public finances 
 In 2003, the deficit would increase to 4.3 % of GDP in 
ESA 95 terms from 3.9% in 2002. The forecast includes 
provisionally the surplus of the open pension funds, 

which is expected to reach approx. 1.7% of GDP this 
year, but whose classification 
remains to be decided.  
In 2004, notwithstanding the strengthening of economic 

growth, the investment rec
overy and the increase of 
private consumption, the general government balance is 
projected to increase substa
ntially to 5.9% of GDP, 
reflecting additional spending pressures arising from 

accession. Revenues are set to decrease following the 

implementation of a tax reform, which lowers the 
corporate income tax rate. 
Under the no-policy-change 
assumption, the fiscal adjust
ment in the election year 2005 would be mainly cyclical with a positive role 

played by the disbursement of structural funds. It is 
projected that the deficit will fall to 4.9% of GDP in 
2005. The medium-term fiscal strategy announced 

recently by the government 
and complemented by the 
programme of expenditure cuts (the so-called Hausner™s 

plan) might further contribute to lowering the deficit to 

some limited degree in 2005
. However, this forecast 
does not take into account the 
fiscal reform plan, as the 
measures have not yet been adopted. The gross debt 
ratio, which would stand at 45.1% of GDP in 2003, is 
expected to increase to above 51% by the end of 2005.

92304978 European Economy9. Slovakia  Keeping up strong growth 
Growth in 2002 and in the first half of 2003  
 In 2002, real GDP growth a
ccelerated to 4.4%. Like in 
the year before, domestic demand has been the main 
growth engine Œ owing to a strong expansion in private 

and public consumption. Private consumption was in 
particular driven by an exceptionally high real wage 
increase. Public consumpti
on reflected the electoral cycle. Gross fixed investment 
contracted slightly after a 
very strong expansion in 2001. The contribution to 

GDP growth by net exports was minor.   

 In the first half of 2003, growth slowed down to 3.9% 
and its composition turned around. The contribution by 
domestic demand (excluding stocks) fell to almost zero. 
Both public and private consumption were dampened 

significantly by fiscal rest
raint and administered price 
adjustments. Gross fixed capital formation fell. In spite 

of the lacklustre performance of Slovakia™s main export 

markets and reflecting the 
creation of significant new 
export capacity, exports of goods and services rose 
strongly by 22.8%,  outpacing import growth of 15.8% 

and leading to a net external contribution to GDP 
growth of 5.1 percentage points.  
 Growth prospects 
 The immediate outlook for the Slovak economy is for a 
continuation of sustained growth performance for the 
rest of 2003, leading to an annual  growth rate of 3.8%. 
The growth composition should basically stay the same 

  as in the first half of the year, although the contribution 

of domestic demand is foreseen to become positive as 
well, based, 
inter alia,
 on a pick-up in gross fixed 
capital formation during the rest of the year. 
  As for 2004 and 2005, growth is predicted to steadily 

accelerate to 4.3%, with all domestic demand 
components making an increasing contribution and net 
exports becoming the junior, but still significant, 

growth contributor.  
 Inflation  CPI headline inflation reached a record low of 3.3% in 
2002 Œ down  from over 7% in 2001. As the 
government continues to adjust administered prices and 

indirect taxes, headline inflation in 2003 and 2004 is 
likely to surge back to over 8%. In the first half of 
2003, it averaged at 7.8%
. Core inflation, which 
excludes these effects, averaged at 2.3%. 
 Assuming that second round effects are kept under 

control, a rapid disinflation leading to an inflation rate 
of around 5% in 2005 should be possible.  
 Current Account 
 Mainly dominated by trade developments, the current 
account deficit narrowed subs
tantially from over 8% of 
GDP in 2002 to slightly below 5% in the 12 months 

until June 2003. Foreign trade developments should 

again be the main factor behind a further narrowing this 
year and a current account 
deficit of around 4½% of 
GDP in 2004 and 2005, as Slovakia further expands its 

export capacity.  Labour market  
 Real wages rose significantly in 2002 (by around 6% on 
a CPI basis), as nominal wage increases were not kept 
in line with the low inflation. In the first half of 2003, 
real wages decreased by roughly 1½%. Unemployment 

is slowly but steadily falling. It amounted to 18.6% in 
2002 and to 17.7% in the first half of 2003.  
 
In spite of continuing enterprise restructuring, 
unemployment is set for a slow but steady further 
decline to around 16½% by 2005 Œ the main reason 

being a more decisive policy stance in tackling the 
deep-seated structural unemployment problem.

Public finances  
Approximating ESA95 standards, the general 
government deficit reached 7.
2% of GDP in the election 
year 2002.  
After the elections in Sept
ember 2002, the new Slovak 
government has initiated a fiscal turn-around, aiming at 
a general government deficit target of 5% of GDP for 
2003. To this end, the government has already 

advanced excise tax increases from the beginning of 
2004 to August 2003, in the face of emerging budget 
execution risks. In 2004, a fa
r-reaching tax reform will 
be implemented, consisting mainly of the introduction 
of a flat income tax rate and a unified value added tax, 

both at 19%. Estimates  suggest that the tax reform is 
likely to be broadly revenue-neutral. Against this 
backdrop, it is projected th
at the government will  
 basically meet its deficit target of 3.9% of GDP for 
2004 and will reduce the deficit further to around 3½% 
of GDP in 2005.  
Risks to this scenario stem in particular from the 
fundamental nature of the tax reforms,  which make any 
revenue forecast uncertain and which are not yet 
matched with the same degree of precision as regards 

substance and sequencing of 
corresponding expenditure 
reforms. Furthermore, the introduction of a funded 

pension pillar, which is considered for 2005, would add 

roughly 1% to that year™s deficit unless compensating 
measures are taken Œ like for instance further 
parametric reforms of the pay-as-you-go pillar.

  94304978 European Economy10. Slovenia  Steady and balanced growth despite the weak international environment 
 The economy in 2002 
 Slovenia has generally performed well in 

macroeconomic terms and achieved stable GDP 
growth; rates have been steady at 3-5% since 1993. In 
2002, growth reached 2.9%, driven by domestic 

demand, which was mostly fed by revived investment, 
while household and government consumption stayed 
subdued. Stronger domestic demand in turn stimulated 

import growth. The net external demand contribution to 
growth declined as weak EU
 markets, the main trade 
area for Slovenia, put downward pressure on export 

expansion. Nevertheless, total export growth
 remained 
relatively dynamic thanks to continued market gains 
outside the EU, notably Russia and the Balkans. 
  Robust real export growth combined with improved 

terms of trade led to a shar
p improvement in the current 
account. In 2002, the current account 
surplus rose to 1.7% of GDP, the highest level since 1994. At the same 

time, the usually low inward foreign direct investment 
flows reached record levels 
at 8.3% of GDP, mostly 
linked to privatisation in banking and pharmaceuticals, 
constituting the main part of capital inflows in 2002. 
 Prospects 
 For this year, the forecast projects a deceleration in 
GDP growth to 2.1% despite especially buoyant 
domestic consumption driving the economy. Next year, 
GDP growth should accelerate to 3.1% as domestic 
demand strengthens and export growth picks up with 
revived EU growth. All components should push GDP 
growth in 2005, with domestic demand giving the main 

impetus.
  GDP components 
 Both consumption and investment demand this year are 

foreseen to recover, increasing by 2.3% and 5.2%, 
respectively. Consumer and 
investor confidence have 
been rising despite sluggish real wage and employment 
growth. Next year, a modest upturn is projected with 
consumption and investment picking up against the 
background of EU accession, market competition and 

enterprise restructuring, increasing exports, and a boost 
in construction investment stimulated by released funds 
from the national housing saving scheme.
   
Exports will expand only marginally in 2003, as 

external demand from the EU is weak while the high 
export growth to markets of former Yugoslavia, CIS, 
and CEFTA, slowly fades. For the remaining forecast 

period, export growth is expected to accelerate 
somewhat. Import growth is also set to rise slightly, in 
step with strengthened domestic (investment) demand 

and exports. Overall, the cu
rrent account surplus slowly 
erodes by 2005. 

 Costs and prices 
 Although inflation has been inching downward, its 

persistency remains a concern. For 2002, inflation stood 
at 7.5%, down from 8.6% in 2001. In the course of 
2003 some further declin
e was registered, reaching 
6.3% by August. This development is more attributable 
to special factors (such as 
caps on administered price 
rises and excise tax changes)
 than to a co-ordinated 
policy to lower inflation on a sustained basis. A steady 
depreciation of the currency continues to add to 

inflationary pressures. However, backward-looking 
indexation mechanisms have been weakened. After de-
indexation of interest rates, a wage agreement for public 

sector wages was concluded in July 2003 limiting 
backward-looking indexation and taking into account 
EU inflation and the euro/tolar exchange rate. For the 

private sector, such an arrangement yet needs to be
 negotiated. Still, wage policy seems to have 

successfully kept real wage
 rises below productivity 
growth. For this year, inflation is projected at 5.9% 
while a further decline to 4.3% is envisaged in 2005, 
based on a further de-indexation of the economy, 

although there are risks. 
 The prime objective of the Bank of Slovenia (BoS) is to 

pursue price stability. This has proven hard to achieve.

Acceding Countries, Slovenia band targets. In 2002, M3 achieved slightly lower 
growth but with 23%, again surpassed the upper limit 
set at 18%, providing room for inflation to persist. M3 

growth in the first half of 2003 has been more limited, 
standing at 16% y-o-y in June 2003. Like last year, 
monetary expansion is partly a result of high capital 

inflows, prompting the BoS to attempt to sterilise these 
flows.  
 Labour market 
 Employment fell marginally in 2002 while the 
unemployment rate remained stable at 6%. This year 
the prospects for the labour market remain gloomy with 
employment decreasing and unemployment increasing. 

In 2004, the unemployment rate is to return to past 
levels of slightly above 6% and then resume its gradual 
trend decline as GDP growth strengthens.
   Public finances 

 General government budget deficits have been 
relatively small. Nevertheless, there have been 
unexpected shortfalls, leading to budgetary 
overshooting and the repeated introduction of 

supplementary budgets in r
ecent years. In
 2002, the deficit rose by 0.6 percentage
 points more than planned, 
to 2.4% of GDP. With direct tax reform and 

expenditure limits, the deficit for this year is projected 
to decline marginally to 2.2% of GDP and then
 decrease further to 1.8% and 1.7% of GDP in 2004 and 

2005,
 respectively. Wages constitute an important part 
of general government spending and the recent 
agreement on public sector wa
ges is expected to contain 
budget expenditures.

    96304978 European Economy  Chapter 5 Other Candidate Countries 304978 European Economy304978 European Economy1. Bulgaria  Catching up on the basis of strong domestic demand 
 The economy in 2003  
 Following three consecutive y
ears of real GDP growth 
above 4%, catching-up continued at a rate of 4.1% in 
the first half of 2003. Growth is based on domestic 

demand, in particular private consumption and 
investment, arising from strong increases in 
employment, net income and bank credit. While net 

exports had a slightly positive contribution to growth of 
0.1% in 2002, there was a strong negative contribution 
of almost 4% in the first half of 2003.  

 Consumer price inflation has declined further from 
5.8% on annual average in 2002 to 1.6% on average 
until September 2003, mostly resulting from low food 
prices and low import prices following the depreciation 

of the US dollar. Registered unemployment decreased 
to 13.0% in August 2003 and is about 4½ percentage 
points lower than one year ear
lier due to jobs created in 
the private sector and government employment 
schemes. The current account deficit was at 4.7% of 
GDP in 2002, considerably lower than in 2001, when it 

stood at 6.1% of GDP. However, it increased to 5.0% of 
forecast GDP until July 2003 because of higher deficits 
in the trade and income balances. Net inflows of foreign 
direct investment in 2002 amounted to about 3.1% of 
GDP, almost the same as in the first half of 2003 at 
estimated 2.7% of forecast GDP.  
 Prospects 
 Growth of real GDP is expected to amount to 4½% in 
2003 and to accelerate to rates of 5% in 2004 and 5½% 

in 2005. This will be due to an improving external 
environment, in particular in
 the EU as its main trading 
partner, as well as the continuation of an economic 
policy oriented towards macroeconomic stability and 
structural reforms.  

 While GDP growth is expected
 to be rather steady, its 
composition shows some vari
ation over the forecasting 
horizon. Private consumption will be very strong in 

2003 because of high credit growth, higher employment 
and increases in real income above productivity growth 
due to the unexpectedly low 
inflation. These effects are 
likely to moderate somewhat
 in 2004, but accelerating 
investment in view of the business opportunities 

expected from EU accession and some fiscal loosening 
could stimulate domestic demand further in 2005. Net 

exports are forecast to have 
a contribution of Œ3.5% in 
2003, -1.2% in 2004 and Œ1.9% in 2005. 

 Inflation   Consumer price inflation in the second half of 2003 is 
expected to be higher than in the first half, mainly 
arising from increases in 
administered and regulated 
prices, and could reach 3.3% 
at the end of the year. If 
wage increases remain moderate, average inflation is 

likely to have rates of 3½% in 2004 and 4% in 2005, 

mostly due to catching-up e
ffects for service prices and 
increases in administered pr
ices and indirect taxes to 
implement commitments undertaken in the accession 

negotiations.  
 Labour markets  
 In view of continuing high GDP growth, net 
employment gains of 1½% per year in 2004 and 2005 
would make it possible to achieve an unemployment 

rate of about 12.3% in 2005 since the induced 
increasing participation rate is likely to be offset by a 
declining share of the working-age population.  

 Public finances  
 For 2003, the forecast assumes that the general 
government deficit target of 0.7% of GDP will be 

revised towards a balanced budget in order to avoid a 
substantial fiscal expansion at the end of the year given 
the revenue over performance until August 2003 with 

an accumulated budget surplus (in cash terms) of more 
than 2% of forecast GDP. Th

Other Candidate Countries, Bulgaria  of 0.7% of GDP is in line with the medium-term fiscal 
framework as presented in the Pre-accession Economic 
Programme 2003. However, the election year 2005 

could see a limited widening of the budget deficit to 1% 
of GDP and less wage discipline. The government™s 
commitment to reducing the expenditure-to-GDP ratio 

implies that public consumption should expand less 
than GDP. The continuation of running a high primary 
surplus and of high GDP growth will further reduce the 

debt-to-GDP ratio to belo
w 50% over the forecasting 
horizon. 

 External balance  The deficit of the trade bala
nce is expected to decrease 
from 10.9% of GDP in 2003 to 10.0% of GDP in 2004, 
but to increase again to 10
.4% in 2005 as a result of 
strong domestic demand and the high import content of  

fixed investment because of the rather limited domestic 

production of investment goods and intermediate goods.  
The substantial difference 
between trade and current 
account deficit arises from 
high positive net exports of 
services, in particular tourism, as well as positive net 

current transfers. The current account deficit is forecast 
to increase above 6% of GDP in 2003 and just below 
6% of GDP in 2004, but could widen again in 2005 as a 

result of strong domestic demand and less favourable 
terms of trade. FDI could be at record levels in 2003 
and 2004 related to both greenfield investment and 

privatisation. However, privatisation is planned to be 
finalised until the end of 2004 so that FDI might be 
lower and be mainly related to greenfield investment in 
2005.

  100304978 European Economy2. Romania  A weakening current ac
count accompanies domestic
 driven growth and further disinflation  
 The economy in 2003  
 Growth slowed down somewhat but remained robust in 
2003 as the economic rec
overy entered its fourth 
consecutive year. Real GDP 
growth equalled 4.9% in 
2002 and 4.3% in the first half of 2003 but its 

composition changed as do
mestic demand accelerated 
and the external balance deteriorated. In 2002, 

household consumption growth slowed down to 3% and 
net exports contributed positively to growth for the first 

time in the current upswing. During the first half of 
2003, instead, household consumption growth picked 
up again, rising by 5.4% on an annual basis, on the back 

of sharply rising net wages and booming consumer 
credit. With investment spending also continuing to 
increase apace at 7.8%, import growth remained 

sustained at 13.1%. At 11.3%, export growth 
decelerated causing the cont
ribution of net exports to 
growth to turn negative again. 
As a result of these trends
, the current account deficit 
began widening again in 2003. After dropping sharply 
to 3.5% of GDP in 2002, by July 2003, the cumulative 
current account deficit over the previous twelve months 

rose to an estimated 4.3%
 of GDP. However, the 
process of sustained and gradual disinflation that started 

in late 1999 continued. After falling to 17.8% by 

December 2002 against an offi
cial target of 22%, the 
year-on-year inflation rate declined to 15.9% in 

September 2003. 
    Prospects 
 The immediate outlook for the Romanian economy 
points to sustained growth, broadly stable 
unemployment and declining inflation. Relative to the 
Spring 2003 forecast, a wors
ened external situation and 
a sharper acceleration in domestic demand justify an 

upward revision in the project
ed current account deficit. 
Following a tightening of policies over the second half 
of 2003, the forecast scen
ario assumes the ongoing 
acceleration of domestic demand will be kept in check. 

However, given the planned relaxation of the fiscal 

stance and the uncertainties surrounding the planned 
concomitant reduction in the quasi-fiscal deficit, risks 
are clearly on the downside.  

 GDP growth and components  
 After totalling 4.6% in 2003, projected GDP growth is 
expected to accelerate slightly on the back of domestic 

demand. Rising real incomes and increasing availability 
of credit will underpin a strong growth of household 
consumption while investment spending grows at an 

accelerating pace thanks to higher capital outlays by 
both the private and public sectors. Exports, are 
expected to continue expanding rapidly thanks to strong 

productivity gains and a strengthening recovery in 
Romania's EU markets.  Howe
ver, with strong domestic 
demand supporting imports growth, the contribution of 

net exports to GDP growth is projected to turn negative 
again from 2003 onwards.  

 Inflation  Despite significant increases in energy tariffs at the 
beginning of September, CPI inflation is projected to 

continue declining, dropping to 14.0% year-on-year by 
end-2002, and reaching single
 digit levels by end-2004 as the central bank gradually lowers the rate of nominal 
depreciation of the exchange rate. Largely as a result of 
a sharp increase in the mi
nimum wage and a cut in 
employee™s rate for social secu
rity contribution, real net 
wages increased by 8.7% in the first eight months of the 

year compared to the corr
esponding period in 2002. 
Albeit lower, wage growth is projected to remain robust 
in 2004 and 2005 due to further minimum wage 
increases and strong productivity gains.

Other Candidate Countries, Romania
  Labour market  
 Statistical revisions significantly affect the behaviour of 
labour market indicators in 2004, as well as during the 
current year. Continued labour shedding by 

restructuring enterprises is expected to moderate the 
positive effects of sustained economic growth on labour 
demand. Against the background of a declining 

population and very slight rises in the participation rate, 
the unemployment rate is projected to remain relatively 
low. 

 Public finances  
 Despite lower than planned revenues, the general 
government deficit only amounted to 0.6% of GDP over 
the first seven months of the year. This prudent 
implementation of the 2003 budget and the adoption of 

a revised budget compensating for the revenue shortfall 
and accommodating for additional spending to advance 
structural reform imply that the 2.7% of GDP general 

government deficit target should be easily met.  
As of 2004, however, net borrowing by the general 
government will increase to 3%
 of GDP, largely due to 
a further cut in the social security contribution rate, the 
introduction of a reduced VAT rate and a rise in 
transfers linked to enterprise restructuring. Gross debt, 
however, is projected to remain roughly stable at 

around 21.5% of GDP. 
 External balance   Romania™s external position 
is projected to weaken on 
the back of a widening trade deficit. Despite 
continuously strong export growth, in fact, robust 
domestic demand is projected to pull in imports of both 
consumer and capital goods. Coupled with a slight 
worsening in net factor income from abroad, this will 

cause the current account deficit to rise throughout the 
period. However, the continued improvement in the 
service trade balance and the steady, albeit gradual, 

increase in transfers from abroad are projected to limit  
the extent of the external deterioration.

  102304978 European Economy3. Turkey  At the beginning of a virtuous cycle ? 
 The economy since the first half of 2003  
 Since the beginning of the y
ear, the economic situation 
has further stabilised. Inflationary pressures and real 
interest rates have come down, while robust exports and 
restocking have supported strong output recovery. The 
Turkish economy weathered relatively well the 

uncertainties related to the tensions and the war in 
neighbouring Iraq. Financial market pressure, which 
had built up during the increased tensions, abated 
rapidly once the fighting in Ir
aq came to an end. During 
the first half of 2003, output rose by 5.8%, mainly 
driven by restocking and exports. The latter increased 
by 13% during the first half of the year. Investment 
increased by 7%, despite a very weak performance of 

construction. Public consumption declined by 3%, 
while private consumption grew by 4½% in this period. 
However, import growth was very strong in the first 

half of 2003, reflecting the high import content of 
exports and investment, but also the strength of the 
Turkish lira, which remained remarkably strong during 

this period. Due to weak domestic demand and the 
strength of the Turkish currency, inflationary pressures 
continued to decline.  

 Prospects 
 The outlook for the Turkish economy implies that the 
immediate rebound after the sharp 2001 recession will 

peter out, leading to a slowdown in real GDP growth 
from 7.8% in 2002 to slightly above 5% in 2003 and 
4½% in 2004. In 2005, accelerating private 
consumption and investment will lead to a GDP growth 

rate of 5%, which is close to potential output growth.   

Inflationary pressures are 
expected to continue to 
decline, driven by stability-oriented fiscal and monetary 

policies. This decline will have a positive impact on 

real disposable income and consumer confidence. In 
line with lower price volatility, a significantly reduced 
public sector borrowing and an improved predictability, 

interest rates should come down, leading to increased 
private investment and a more balanced economic 
growth. Furthermore, Turkey's international 
environment is likely to improve moderately in 2004 
and 2005. 

 GDP components 
 During the forecasting period, output growth is 
expected to be increasingly driven by private 

consumption and investment. Declining inflation will 
strengthen household income and improve consumer 
confidence. As a result, private consumption is 

expected to accelerate, from
 an annual growth of 3½% 
in 2003 to 4% in 2005. The increase of public 

consumption will be limited by the need to achieve a 

substantial primary surplus. Thus, the forecast expects 
only a moderate increase in 2003 by 1%, which will 
accelerate to 2½% and 3% annual growth in 2004 and 

2005. Among domestic demand components, 
investment will be the most significant source of 
growth. After several years of particularly weak 

investment, the improved economic stability and 
declining real interest rates will lead to a significant 
increase in investment.  
 Inflation  The trend of declining inflationary pressures is expected 
to continue during the 
forecasting period. Hence, 
towards the end of the forecasting period, Turkey might 

be able to witness single-digit inflation rates.  The main 

factors behind this decline are declining inflationary 
expectations of households, a strict wage policy in the 
public sector and a stability-oriented monetary policy of 

the Central Bank.  
 Labour market 
 After the marked increase 
in unemployment in 2002 
and the first half of 2003, the situation in the labour 
market will remain difficult in the near future. One 
important issue in this respect is a rather high increase 

in the working-age labour for
ce. So far, this increase in 
labour supply has been largely compensated by a

Other Candidate Countries, Turkey  declining participation rate. In view of the recovery, 
the participation rate might increase again, raising 
labour supply accordingly. As a result, despite rising 

employment, the unemployment rate might remain 
relatively high.  
 Public finances 
 So far, the budgetary performance remained largely 
on track with fiscal targets.
 The forecast expects that during the forecast period, the general government 
deficit will decline. The main factor for this 
improvement will be lower interest payments, 
reflecting lower interest rate
s and a marked decline in 
the debt stock. Non-interest expenditures are seen to 

remain stable as a percentage of GDP, while the 

phasing-out of one-off revenue measures will lead to 
a slight decline in general government revenues.  
 
  Despite impressive progress, the need to consolidate 
public sector finances will continue to confine the 
room for a more active fiscal policy. Furthermore, the 

high interest rate sensitivity and short-term nature of 
the Turkish debt could lead to difficulties in case of 
another financial market turbulence. 
External accounts Exports performed remarkably well in 2002 and 
2003, despite weak growth in important export 
markets and the strength of the exchange rate. In 

view of the expected impr
ovement in th
e external environment, export growth is likely to remain high. 

The accelerating investment 
and private consumption 
will lead to strong growth of imports, which will 

result in a marked deterioration of the current 

account.    Table 5.3

 Fiscal policy boosts growth  Current situation 
 The recovery in the United States has been gaining 

momentum lately with consumer spending advancing 
strongly and business investment picking up. After two 
quarters with sluggish growth, output expanded at an 

annual rate of 3.3% in the second quarter of 2003. 
Recent economic data indicate that third-quarter growth 
has been even stronger. The abatement of geopolitical 
uncertainties since April has undoubtedly contributed to 
the economic rebound. But more important has been the 
continuation of an accomodative monetary policy and, 
particularly, the fiscal expansion. The tax cuts adopted 
in May have boosted both real disposable income and 

consumer spending while allowing the personal saving 
rate to increase at the same time. Public consumption 
has surged in connection with the war in Iraq. The 

federal deficit alone amounted to 3.5% of GDP in fiscal 
year 2003 which ended in September. 
 
Employment has been a disappointing feature of the 
present recovery with the number of nonfarm payroll 
jobs on a declining trend until the autumn of 2003. The 

"jobless" nature of the recovery is reflecting strong 
gains in labour productivity: 
according to the official 
statistics, output per hour in the non-farm business 
sector increased at an annual
 rate of 4.8% over the two 
years to mid-2003. Helped by productivity growth and a 

considerable 'output gap', core inflation declined to 

1.2% in September. The dollar's external value has 
continued its trend decline: the average of the Federal 
Reserve's price-adjusted broad dollar index was about 
5% lower in the first nine months of 2003 as compared 
to 2002. The trade defic
it and the current account 
deficit worsened to 4.6%, respectively 5.2%, of GDP in 
the first six months of the year. 
 Can the recovery become self-sustaining ? 
 The stimulative effect of the expansionary 

macroeconomic policy will eventually taper off. 
Mortgage refinancing activity with the associated cash-
out payments has already subsided. Based on the 

Administration's request for the "war on terrorism" in 
fiscal year 2004, Iraq-related spending will stabilize and 
thereby cease to give an im
petus to GDP growth. The 
stipulated profile of tax cuts imply a strongly 

diminishing stimulatory effect from the middle of next 

year. Hence, the question is 
whether the current fiscal 
boost will generate sufficient momentum for the 

recovery to become self-sustaining.  

 The softness of the labour market seems to be a 
considerable risk for the strength of the recovery. It has 

held down consumer confidence since the spring 
despite fast-rising disposable incomes. When this tax 
cut boost peters out household spending may also be 

reined in by the relatively high level of household 
indebtedness and debt-service burden. 
 
Strong productivity growth has benefited corporate 
profits which, in turn, has stimulated the upturn in 
business investments. The productivity growth trend 

seems unbroken and should continue to provide an 
incentive for capital spending. The low level of interest 
rates provides also a favourable background for 
investments. However, capital spending will be 
constrained by a considerable
 degree of unused capacity 
in the manufacturing sector and in non-residential 
structures.  
Although the dollar has deprec
iated noticeably since its 
high point in early 2002, by the first half of October it 

was still about 6% above its average value since 1990 

in real effective terms. Based on the assumption of 
constant real exchange rates, 
it is projected that external 
trade will continue to exert a 
drag on US growth even in 
the context of a streng
thening world economy. 
 Growth and deficits to continue 
 The forecast expects the US 
economy to grow strongly 
in the second half of 2003 which should lift the annual 
growth rate to 2.8%. Relatively rapid growth is

 The US 'twin deficits'
Forecast
107304978 European EconomyChapter 6 
Non-EU-countries, USA   projected to continue until the middle of next year when 
the fiscal stimulus will diminish. Against the 
background of a temporary deceleration in consumer 

spending, the GDP growth rate should recede to about 
3% annualized in the second ha
lf of 2004. But due to an 
overhang from the strong growth in the second half of 
2003, the annual growth rate would reach 3.8% in 2004. 
In 2005, output growth would return to its long-term 
potential. Inflation would remain subdued and 

employment growth would resume, but not sufficiently 
to prevent a slight rise in the unemployment rate. The 
risks of this forecast with re
gard to growth seem to be 
evenly balanced. 

 
In this scenario, capital formation would expand at a 
relatively healthy rate around 6% and public spending 
growth would fall back from recent elevated levels. 

Exports would pick up from the negative growth rates 
in the first half of 2003 in response to a strengthening of 
global growth and the dollar depreciation over the past  
18 months. Import growth has already resumed strongly 
in the second quarter and can be
 expected to continue in 
conjunction with domestic demand growth. As the level 
of imports is roughly 50% higher than the level of 
exports, the projected convergence of import and export 
growth rates is not sufficient to stabilize the trade 

deficit or to end the negative contribution of external 
trade to GDP growth. The trad
e deficit is projected to 
widen to 5.1% of GDP and the current account deficit 
even to 5.8% of GDP by 2005. 
 The fiscal expansion is projected to worsen the fiscal 
position of general government to 5% of GDP in 2003 
and even to 5.5% next year. 
This means that the current  
account deficit will almost fully represent a domestic 
fiscal deficit. The 'twin-deficit' situation will aggravate 
the long-standing concern about the sustainability of the 

external deficit and is likely to increase the risk of a 
disorderly correction.

108304978 European Economy2. Japan  Moderate growth outl
ook with downside risks  In Japan, stronger-than-expected real growth was 
registered in the first half
 of this year. Growth was 
broad-based, mainly driven by corporate investment 
and private consumption. However, the reported data of 
0.6% non-annualised growth in the first quarter and 
1.0% in the second quarter ar
e significantly higher than 
the ‚underlying™ development as a result of 
overestimated deflators. Nevertheless, even if data were 
to be corrected for these statistical distortions, there is a 

cyclical recovery gaining momentum. 
 A number of leading indicat
ors and confidence surveys 
suggest output expansion to continue in the second half 

of the year. The strong rebound in corporate profits, 

enhanced capacity utilizat
ion in the manufacturing 
sector along with better prospects for global demand are 

likely to back solid investment expansion also in the 

remainder of the year. Priv
ate consumption, which has 
been firm despite previous cuts in real take home pay 

and a high unemployment level, should also remain 

supportive to growth as the labour market situation has 
started to ease slightly and real wages have begun to 
increase again. Prospects fo
r key export markets, the 
US and the rest of Asia, have improved and should help 
keeping up the recovery in the second half of year. 
Given these positive developments, real GDP growth of 

2.6% seems to be within reach in the current year. 
 As restructuring and consolidation of balance sheets in 

the corporate sector gradually have moved forwards, 
the Japanese economy should be able to continue to 
benefit from the global recovery. Private demand is 
expected to continue to be the main driving force, with 
a positive contribution from net exports. On the whole, 

growth is projected to remain moderately positive, 
averaging 1.7% on an annual basis in 2004 and 1.5% in 

2005.  
 There are also some positive signs in the labour market. 

Total employment has registered an upward trend since 
spring. Job creation has been particularly strong in the 
services sector whereas the manufacturing sector has 

continued to cut back on employees. In tandem, 
unemployment has declined by almost half a percentage 
point since the beginning of the year. New job offers, a 
leading indicator, are also increasing.   
 
As for deflation, the decline in core CPI (excluding 
fresh food) has decelerated
 substantially since the 
beginning of the year, from Œ0.8% year-on-year in 
January to Œ0.3% in August
. The fall in 
the corporate goods price index (CGPI) has shown a similar 

downward trend. Even if part of the deceleration in core 

CPI is due to tax hikes and rises in medical fees, 
deflationary pressures might be easing somewhat as the 
economy continues to expand.  

 On public finances, the general government budget 
deficit stood at above 7% of GDP and the gross debt 

exceeded 150% of GDP in 
2002. The government™s 
ambitions to cut public investment and other 

discretionary expenditure are 
largely offset by rising 
social expenditure linked 
to the ageing of the 
population. The fiscal stance 
is assumed to be roughly 
neutral throughout the forecast period. 
 Monetary policy has turned more expansionary and 
remains committed to maintain zero-interest rates until 
core deflation has been brought to an end. The Bank of 
Japan has raised the operating target for current 

accounts to 27-32 trillion yen (210-250 billion •). A 
scheme of purchasing Asse
t-Backed Securities (ABS), 
as a means of channelling funds to SMEs, has also 

been set up. The quantitativ
e framework, i.e. of 
ensuring ample supply of liquidity to the banking 

system, has helped alleviating the strains on the 

financial sector. However, it is unlikely to have played 
a major role in the current recovery and it has not put 
an end of deflation. 

 In the first three quarters of
 this year, the Ministry of 
Finance intervened on a mass
ive scale, totalling some 
13.5 trillion yen (105 billion •). De facto, the exchange 

rate was kept within a band of 115-120 yen/US$.

Non EU countries, Japan 
 However, in connection to the G7 meeting in 
September, the authorities seem to have accepted a 
stronger yen. In the past month, the yen has gradually 

strengthened and is currently trading below 110 
yen/US$, although the authorities are reported to 
continue intervening in the foreign exchange markets. 

Given that the Japanese economy remains much 
dependent on export-led growth, any strong and rapid 
appreciation of the yen co
uld hamper the current 
upturn.  
 Several risks remain to the Japanese economy. 
Although major banks have made progress in reducing 
their non-performing loans, the quality of the banks™ 

capital base remains very weak, making the banking 
sector vulnerable to any renewed fall in asset prices. 
Balance sheets in most corp
orate sectors have been 
consolidated, but there are still some sectors (real 
estate, construction and wholesale/retail) that are highly 

indebted. In addition, the development of public 
finances, with a rapidly increasing government debt and 
a large deficit, is clearly not
 sustainable in the medium-
term.
