431.Belgium
Deceleration in activity linked to the cycle in the Eurozone
Economic situation and prospects
The business cycle in the open economy of Belgium is
closely linked to that of its main European partners, in
particular those of the euro zone. Since 2001, slower

activity and weaker demand in the neighbouring

countries, was accompanied by a sharp fall in real GDP

growth in Belgium: after being particularly strong in

2000, the increase in real GDP decelerated to 0.8% in
2001 and 0.7% in 2002. In 2001, the quarterly profile
was particularly weak, ending by a decline of 0.5% in

the fourth quarter. A mild recovery was registered at the

beginning of 2002 but the improvement remained weak

throughout the year and real GDP growth reached

barely 0.2% in the fourth quarter. Declining confidence
due to external developments and uncertainties related
to geopolitical developments and oil prices are currently

delaying prospects of economic recovery: the trough of
the cycle is postponed to the end of Spring, two quarters
later than expected in Autumn. The synthetic indicator
of the Belgian National Bank, which reflects the short
term fundamental trend, was still deteriorating at the
beginning of 2003. Real GDP growth is forecast to

reach 1.2% in 2003 and 2.3% in 2004, under the

assumption of improving external prospects. However,
significant risks weigh on this forecast, all of them
stemming from external developments.
GDP components
In 2002, private consumption was restricted by the
increase in unemployment, registered as from 2001 and

from worsening expectations; some improvement in
confidence indicators in the course of the year did not

last. In March 2003, the consumer confidence index

was at its lowest since 2001, due to negative
expectations concerning economic and employment
prospects as well as the financial situation of
households. As employment is expected to recover only
in late 2003, with delay as against resuming activity, the

saving ratio is forecast to remain at a high level
throughout the period. Improvement in world economic
activity should be translated progressively into higher
confidence and stronger consumption in the course of
the second half of  2003 and in 2004. In view of the

uncertain external environment, weak demand

conditions and particularly low capacity utilisation,
productive investment was particularly subdued in
2002. In 2003, improvement in export markets and in

domestic demand are expected to foster private

investment which should gradually strengthen during

the year and continue in 2004. Exports, which have

been weakening since 2001, should recover in 2003 as a
result of recovery in world trade; however, the effective
appreciation of the euro will result presumably in

market shares losses outside the euro area, while
exports to the neighbouring euro partners are not
expected to recover strongly. Recovery in Belgian

external trade is therefore expected to be relatively slow
and contribution to real GDP growth from external
demand should be modest.
Labour market, costs and prices
Robust progress in employment is not foreseen in the
course of 2003 and, on average, it is expected to

continue to decline slightly. As some improvement will
be registered in the last part of the year, strengthening
in the course of 2004, increase in total employment
might reach 0.7% in that year. The unemployment rate,

which has been on a slow but continuous increasing

path since 2001, will continue to rise in 2003 and
stabilise in 2004.
Costs and prices perspectives can be considered
relatively positive. Imported inflation is expected to be

offset for a large part by the appreciation of the euro;

the oil bill, in particular, invoiced in dollars, should be
alleviated by the exchange rate effect. However, this
assumption encompasses significant risks related to
unpredictable surges in oil prices or to oil production
disruptions. As far as internal costs are concerned, the
framework nominal wage agreement for the private
sector, which covers the years 2003-2004, is aiming at
preserving cost competitiveness in Belgium, taking as
benchmark the three main economic partners of

Belgium. A norm for nominal wage increases was set at
Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
Belgium
445.4% for the whole period 2003 and 2004, which, when
compared with the 6.4% limit set by the previous
agreement covering 2001 and 2002, reflects some
resumed wage moderation. Sectoral agreements are
expected to be rather moderated in 2003, particularly in

view of the situation on the labour market; higher

increases might be delayed to 2004. In 2002, underlying
inflation decelerated sharply, partly due to the abolition

of the television license fee in Flanders and Brussels but
also due to weakening demand and import prices.
Reduction in inflation is expected to continue in 2003
and 2004 as a result of easing domestic cost pressures

and limited increases in non-oil import prices.
However, in this respect, large uncertainties exist

related to oil prices.
Public financesIn 2002, despite macroeconomic developments less
supportive than assumed in the budget, the general
government accounts reached a small surplus of 0.1 %
of GDP. Budgetary control exercises were organised in

March and July associating all levels of government.
Expenditure was constrained, while in the social
security sector, health spending, after a strong increase

in 2001, was better controlled. The implementation of

the tax reform resulted in cuts in the personal income

tax and in a progressive phasing out of the crisis
contribution; social security contributions of the
enterprises sector were reduced and some other taxes
were eliminated or reduced in Flanders and Brussels.
The fall in interest payments cushioned the negative

effect of decelerating fiscal revenues. The fall in the

government debt ratio, which had decelerated in 2001,
resumed in 2002 and its level was reduced to 105.3% if
GDP.
The 2003 budget announced further expenditure
restraint while continuing the implementation of the tax
reform; the latter would result in further tax cuts

45amounting to 0.35% of GDP and in reducing tax rates
for corporations, a reduction which, combined with

offsetting measures will be neutral. Excises on tobacco

and some local taxes will be raised. Reaching balance

continues to rely critically on further savings on interest

payments, expected to continue in 2003 as the
government debt ratio declines. However, the 2003
budget was built on a 2.1% real GDP growth

assumption; in February this underlying projection was

reduced to 1.4% while the government balance
objective was maintained. Such an adjustment was
made possible by further containment of federal
expenditure, applying the ﬁanchor principleﬂ (holding

the utilisation rate of credits under or at the rate of 2001 
during a number of months); better than expected tax
revenues at the end of 2002 were also used to fill the
additional gap. An upward correction in savings on

interest payments, due to a more favourable spectrum of

interest rates, was also instrumental.
Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 1.2% in 2003;
consequently, a government deficit of 0.2% of GDP is

forecast under the assumption of no further adjustment
measures. An improvement should occur in 2004, the

government deficit reaching 0.1% of GDP under the
same assumption. At the same time, the government
debt is expected to continue to decline from 105.3% of
GDP in 2002 to 102.7% in 2003 and 98.9% in 2004.

Riding the tides of the slowdown
The economy in 2002
The Danish economy weathered to a large extent the
effects of the international slowdown in 2002. Overall,
real GDP grew by 1.6%, mainly supported by a
sustained growth in final domestic demand. The

quarterly profile of GDP growth during 2002 was very

volatile as large movements in stocks to some extent
disrupted the picture. The expected acceleration in
private consumption finally set in, primarily driven by

increases in car sales, but also retail sales increased at

stronger rates. Investment growth remained largely
unchanged compared to 2001 at just above 1%.
Equipment investment grew surprisingly strongly in
light of the modest overall growth rate, whereas non-
residential investment fell markedly. Housing

investment picked up a little bit again, as house prices
continued to increase.
The volatile stock movements during the year resulted
in stocks putting an overall drag of Œ½ percentage point
on GDP growth. These stock developments are

difficult to understand in light of the economic

developments during the year, and it seems likely that
they include some statistical discrepancies.  
Exports held up very well in spite of the international
slowdown. Exports of goods grew by more than 4% in
real terms, primarily due to a favourable composition of
goods, as many of the goods exported are not very
sensitive to the cycle, and a reorientation in export

markets. Imports grew somewhat less than exports,

resulting in a growth contribution from net exports of ½

percentage point. Furthermore, the current account

registered another high surplus.   
Inflation showed more resilience than expected. After a
small decline in the beginning of the year, inflation has

come up again and ended the year at the same level as it

began.  
Prospects
The immediate outlook for the Danish economy is for a

moderate growth rate in 2003 of 1½% accelerating to
just over 2% in 2004. In both years final domestic
demand is expected to be driving growth, primarily led

by increases in private consumption on the back of

sustained increases in real disposable incomes and the
tax reform announced for 2004. 
The Danish economy continues to be well balanced.
Both public finances and the current account are in
large surpluses. Compared to previous forecasts, the
situation on the labour market has eased, thereby

reducing the risks of overheating.
GDP components 
Private consumption is expected to continue to show
healthy, but slightly lower growth rates in 2003

compared to 2002, as disposable incomes are set to

increase slightly less and inflation remains at a
relatively high level. In 2004, the effects of the

announced tax reform should refuel private
consumption to a growth rate above 2%. Overall
investment is likely to remain subdued in the first half
of 2003 and then increase gradually in the second half
and into 2004. Housing investment is increasing in the

entire forecast period, partly as a result of policy
induced increases. The large depletion of stocks in 2001
and 2002 should come to an end and positive
contributions to GDP growth from stock are expected in
both forecast years.
Exports have to some extent so far been sheltered
against the international slowdown, but the line is to a
large degree expected to run out for these special

factors as the slowdown has turned out to be longer

than expected. Furthermore, the appreciation of the
krone
 and the continued high wage increase put
pressure on competitiveness, resulting in loss of market
shares in both years. Exports are therefore expected to

grow only by 2% in 2003, increasing to just below 5%

in 2004. Imports should grow broadly in line with final

demand, resulting in a small negative contribution from

net exports in both years.   
Chapter 3
Member States, Denmark
47Costs and prices
The resilience in inflation is expected to continue
during most of 2003, as core inflation remains high and
the oil price is increasing. From October 1 2003, a

reduction in excise duties on strong alcohol, tobacco
and soft drinks is implemented Œ equivalent to a

reduction of the inflation rate by ¼ percentage point.
Most of the effect of the reduction will only be visible
in 2004, where inflation is set to decrease also, as result
of the falling oil price. Core inflation is, however, not

expected to decrease markedly over the forecast
horizon, as wage increases remain high.
Labour market 
The recent increase in the number of people
unemployed is expected to continue during most of
2003 with the turn-around setting in during the autumn.

However, compared to previous downturns in the
economy, the increase in unemployment is still only

marginal, and it is not expected to affect the increase in
wages markedly, as wage increases are set to remain
fairly constant around 4% the entire forecast period.
Employment creation is set to increase again during
2003 after employment fell in 2002.

Denmark
48Overall, the Danish labour market is expected to
continue to remain tight. However, the recent
developments in unemployment and employment has
reduced the risk of over-heating. 
Public finances 
The general government balance showed a surplus of
2.0% of GDP in 2002. In 2003, a slightly smaller
surplus of 1.8% of GDP is expected as the larger
unemployment increases transfers to households and

lowers growth rates of some tax revenues. In 2004, the
surplus is set to increase to 2.1% of GDP, despite the
implementation of a tax reform which lowers taxes on

earned income by 0.4% of GDP. The increase stems

from the revenue lost by the tax reform being more than
out-weighed by the positive effects on public finances
by the increased GDP growth and by the fact that the
pension fund yield tax, which has hardly generated any
revenue since 2000 as a result of the prolonged

downturn in the stock market, should generate revenues

amounting to approximately ½% of GDP. This is half

the revenue expected in a year with ﬁnormalﬂ stock

market developments, thereby reflecting the carry-
forward of negative tax-balances. The tax reform has
been taken into the forecast in the way it was specified
in the proposal from the government.
The debt, which currently stands at 45% of GDP is
expected to be reduced to 40% of GDP by the end of
2004.Graph 3.3:

493.Germany
Stagnation extending into the third year 
The economy in 2002
Barely a year after the last contraction, quarterly growth
stagnated again in the fourth quarter of 2002, in an

economic environment combining a high level of
uncertainty related to the outcome of the war in Iraq
with a structurally weak economy. Already much
earlier, in the second half of 2000, growth in Germany

had come to a virtual standstill. Average quarterly
growth since then has been less than 0.1%. Despite
quarterly growth rates of ¼% in the first to third quarter
of 2002 overall GDP last year was merely 0.2% higher
than in 2001, which already disappointed with a growth
rate of only 0.6%. 
Hopes that the long stagnation would soon be overcome
have been dashed. Growth in 2002 was positive only as
a result of a large external contribution in the order of

1.5 % of GDP, because rising exports combined with a

sharp fall in imports. The latter reflected strongly
contracting domestic demand, which fell by 1.5%.
Contraction was particularly marked for equipment
investment, which was more than 9% below the already

low 2001 level. This added to the nearly 6% decline in
the construction sector and the 0.6% fall in private

consumption. Only public consumption posted a slight
increase, largely as a result of an unplanned strong rise
in health care expenditures.  
Prospects
The economic situation at the beginning of 2003 is
hardly changed from that of the end of last year.

Growth is expected to be zero in the first quarter and
might even be negative again in the second quarter.

Uncertainty about the Iraq war, high oil prices and a
strong euro dampen hopes for an export driven-
recovery. This is also reflected in persistently low

business confidence indicators, which recently started
falling again after notching up slightly around the turn
of the year.   
In the light of the difficult international environment,
and due to the fact that the strong import decline of last
year is set to reverse, a pick-up in economic activity,
would therefore have to rely largely on domestic

impulses. This might be possible in the second half of

the year, if the military conflict in Iraq turns out to be

benign. However, domestic impulses are likely to
remain weak, because, as a result of the prolonged
three-year stagnation and the strong fall in stock market

values, many companies need to consolidate their
balance sheets before being able to embark on major

investment programmes. The situation is aggravated by
rising levels of bad debt and losses in the German
financial sector, which limit its lending capacity, in
particular to small and medium-size enterprises. As a
result, an economic recovery in Germany is likely to
again lag behind those of other European countries. 
Despite these potential risks, a restoration of consumer
and producer confidence could lead to a revival of
domestic demand. The savings rate in Germany has

risen substantially over the last two years and

equipment investment is nearly one-fifth below its level
of the middle of 2000. A modest reversal of these
strongly negative developments could bring about an
acceleration of private consumption and investment
activity. There is even hope that the decline in the

construction sector, which has been ongoing since the
middle of the 1990s, might slow down somewhat.  
However, due to an increase in unemployment by over
350,000 people in 2003 and the above-mentioned
financing constraints, a possible economic recovery is

unlikely to develop immediately into a boom. Instead, it
should take the form of a relatively modest acceleration
of economic activity. The overall growth for 2003 is
therefore projected to be below ½ %. 
Economic reforms, notably in the labour market, could
potentially accelerate a recovery, by increasing
economic confidence. However, at the present juncture,
those proposals that have actually been passed as laws
do not yet suffice to herald a significant increase in

Germany™s low potential growth, which lingers at
Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003                                                                    
Germany
50around 1½ %. In any case, noticeable effects would be
visible at best in 2004. 
Despite a modest tax reduction as from January 2004,
the structural problems that held Germany back in the

previous three years will therefore largely persist.

Consequently, growth in 2004 will also likely be
modest. In calendar-adjusted terms, GDP is projected to
increase at a rate near Germany™s potential growth of

about 1½%. Actual growth should, however, attain a

rate of around 2% in 2004, because that year will be
marked by an unusually strong calendar effect of
around 0.6%. This is due simply to having a leap day
(29 February) and several holidays falling on a
weekend. 
The pick-up in growth should translate into a modest
relief for the labour market. Effective wage increases
are likely to remain moderate, having no significant
positive or negative impact on job creation. 
Inflation in Germany continues to be low. After a rate
of 1.4% in 2002 it is expected to slowly fall to 1.3% in
2003 and 1.2% in 2004. However, a low rate of

inflation is problematic insofar as the real interest rates
in Germany remain above the levels elsewhere in the
Euro Area. On the other hand, Germany is gradually
gaining competitiveness vis-à-vis its European
neighbours, which all have higher rates of inflation.

51Public finances 
Following a revised 2001 outcome of 2.8% of GDP, the
general government deficit is currently estimated to

have reached 3.6% of GDP in 2002. This rise is mostly
due to a marked shortfall in tax revenues compared with
the official May 2002 tax estimate, and another
widening of the deficit in social security sectors. Not

surprisingly, the debt ratio has also breached the

respective Treaty criterion by rising to close to 61% of
GDP by end-2002.  
While the March 2003 notification by the Federal
government implies a decline in the nominal deficit to
2.8% of GDP in the current year, the Commission™s
deficit forecast is clearly more pessimistic (3.4% of
GDP). This is first of all due to the fact that the

Commission forecast for nominal GDP growth in 2003
is more than one percentage point of GDP lower than
forecasted by the Federal government in its Annual
Economic Report in January 2003. Furthermore, the
government™s deficit projection still incorporates a
considerable rise in tax revenues from the tax amnesty

and the 
‚Steuervergünstigungsabbaugesetz
™, which was, 
however, rejected by the Bundesrat on 14 March and is
now subject to discussions in the ‚Mediation

Committee™ (Vermittlungsausschuss) between
Bundestag and Bundesrat (Chamber of the Länder).

Finally, the Commission forecast does not incorporate

all of the expenditure savings optimistically projected
by the Federal government at the level of the Federal
Labour Office.
In 2004, accelerating growth conducive to employment
creation should make for a more important fall in the
nominal deficit, in spite of the implementation of the
next step of income tax reform (0.3% of GDP). The

debt ratio, however, is projected to rise further to 63%

of GDP.
The deficit forecast for 2004 is based on the
assumptions of unchanged social security contributions.

Furthermore, none of the measures announced by the

Federal Chancellor on 14 March could be taken into

account, as some of them are not yet very specific or
have not yet been introduced into the legislative
procedure.

Slower economic growth with persisting price pressures
The economy in 2002
Domestic economic activity continued to grow at a rate
well above the EU and euro area average, standing at

4% in 2002. Strong economic growth was supported by
domestic demand and in particular by high investment
spending linked mostly to the preparations for the 2004
Olympic Games. Moreover, the financial flow from the

EU Structural Funds was another important factor
contributing to the increase in investment at a rate
higher than the real GDP growth rate. Private
consumption decelerated as a result of the prevailing
economic uncertainty as well as persisting price

pressures, despite the beneficial effect of recent tax

reform on disposable income. On the external sector,
the decline in foreign demand led to a further widening
of  external transactions deficit due mainly to the
significant decrease in exports. Notwithstanding strong

domestic activity, imports fell owing to the low import

content of investment spending and decelerating private

consumption.    
The situation in the labour market has remained
virtually unchanged as strong domestic activity has not

led to employment gains as would have been expected.

In fact, total employment is estimated to have been
reduced by 0.1% in 2002. The unemployment rate stood
at 9.9%, remaining among the highest in the EU and
euro area. Furthermore, the persisting high
unemployment rates of young workers and females
point to structural rigidities impeding the efficient

functioning of the labour market that would ensure
moderate wage increases.  In the private sector, the two
year wage agreement signed in April 2002 provided for
an increase in the minimum wage in two steps:  3.6%

on 1
st January 2002 and 1.8% on 1
st July 2002. On
average, nominal wages are estimated to have risen by
6.7% in 2002 while an increase of 5.5% is projected for
2003.Consumer price inflation remained well above the euro
area average standing at 3.6% in 2002. Bad weather

conditions resulted in food price increases which
contributed to the rise of inflation in the first months of

the year. Price pressures eased temporarily during the
Summer months remaining however above 3% due
mainly to the considerable increase in prices of

services. Furthermore, underlying inflation exceeded
the headline rate for a second consecutive year

indicating the presence of significant price pressures
emanating apparently from services. 
Prospects in 2003 and 2004
The basic underlying assumption for the prospects of
the Greek economy as they are portrayed in the
forecasts is that strong growth of real GDP will
continue despite the international economic slowdown.

The main driver of this growth will be domestic

demand and in particular investment spending, which
will be sustained by the preparations for the Olympics
and the flows from EU funds. The expected
improvement in the international environment from

2004 and low interest rates may help in keeping
domestic activity buoyant in the period after the end of
the Olympics. Moreover, the Greek economy is very
likely to benefit in the longer run from the still
unrealised growth potential of its neighbouring

countries two of which are scheduled to access EU in

2007. However, the forecasts are subject to
considerable risks due to international uncertainties. 
In 2003, real GDP is expected to rise albeit at a slower
pace reaching 3.6% and remaining above potential.

Investment spending will be the main driver of GDP
growth whereas private consumption is projected to
further decelerate in 2003 and pick up in the last year of
the forecast period. Real GDP growth will  accelerate to
3.8% in line with the expected external recovery in
2004. 
Chapter 3
Member States, Greece
53Domestic and international uncertainties combined with
the persisting inflationary pressures will slow down
private consumption despite the beneficial effect of the
2002 tax reform on disposable income. Notwithstanding
the possible negative effect of pervasive uncertainties
on business investment plans, the acceleration of the

preparations for the Olympic Games and increased

flows from EU Structural Funds will continue boosting
investment spending on non residential construction.
The external transactions deficit is expected to decrease
slightly as imports of goods and services will rise
moderately whereas the gradual elimination of

international tensions might boost tourist flows in the

second half of 2003. However, the external sector
deficit, reflecting domestic macroeconomic imbalances,
will continue to be large throughout the forecasting
period. The sizeable and chronic external sector
imbalances point to the weakening competitiveness of
the economy which is intensified by the persistent
inflation differential in comparison with the euro area . 
Costs and prices
Consumer price inflation is expected to remain high and

well above the EU and euro area average, standing at

3.7% in 2003 and declining to 3.5% in 2004. According

to underlying assumptions for world primary
commodity prices, oil prices and the exchange rate of
the euro, the contribution of imported inflation to
consumer price inflation should be rather negative.

54Furthermore, wage costs in the private sector should
increase moderately following the wage agreement
signed in early 2002. Thus, minimum nominal wages in
the private sector will increase 4.2% in 2003 while
compensation per employee for the whole economy is
estimated to rise 5.5%. Unit labour costs in the whole

economy are expected to decelerate at a rather slow

pace due mainly to pressures stemming from the non-
manufacturing sector. In fact, price developments by
sector in 2001 and 2002 point clearly to the non-
tradable sector as the predominant source of persisting

price pressures. 
Public finances
Government accounts have been revised in 2002 after

an agreement with the Commission (Eurostat) which
resulted in the reclassification and correction in the
treatment of a number of operations. These revisions
turned the previously estimated general government
surpluses for 2000 and 2001 into deficits, altering thus

considerably the budgetary targets set by the 2002

stability programme. Against this background the
general government deficit is estimated to have been
equal to 1.2% of GDP in 2002 compared to a previously

reported surplus of 0.8% of GDP. In 2003, the general

government deficit is projected to decline to 0.9% of

GDP and  stand at 0.4% of GDP in 2004.  
The revision of budgetary data similarly affected
developments    in    the    debt    ratio  which in  2002 is 
estimated to have been equal to 104.9% of GDP,
instead of  97.3% of GDP reported in the 2001 stability
programme. The debt ratio is projected to fall to 96.1%
of GDP at the end of 2004. 
The budgetary strategy adopted by the 2002 stability
programme is based on the assumption of a progressive
decline in debt servicing costs combined with
increasing primary surpluses. Thus, as a result of the
deceleration in government spending anticipated by the
stability programme, primary surplus is estimated to
stand at 4.4% of GDP in 2002 and 4.6% of GDP in
2004. 
The budgetary adjustment path implied by the stability
programme rests heavily on the assumption of a

significant improvement in the central government
balances which is expected to result from holding back
primary spending. However, the deeper-seated spending
pressures and the lack of the decisive measures required

to tackle in particular the problem of some inelastic
categories of government expenditures, render the

achievement of the adopted targets uncertain.
Thus, the general government deficit is estimated to
stand at 1.1% of GDP in 2003 and fall to 1% of GDP in
2004 with the primary surplus declining from 4.1% of
GDP in 2003 to 3.9% of GDP in 2004. The debt ratio is
projected to stand at 101% of GDP in 2003 and
decrease to 97% of GDP in 2004.

Economy to recover strength in 2004
Following 2.7% growth in 2001, weaker final domestic
demand in 2002 led to GDP decelerating significantly

to 2.0% for the whole year, broadly as envisaged in the

autumn forecast. Weaker private consumption and
investment were the main elements of the slowdown.
Given current uncertainties, growth for 2003 is

expected to remain flat at 2.0%, although rising towards

the end of the year and achieving in 2004 3.0%, around

that of estimated potential. The output gap, relative to

trend, should be at around zero at the end of the forecast

period.Activity in 2002
Despite the slowdown in 2002, mainly driven by private

consumption and investment, the still relatively strong

domestic demand led GDP to record sounder rates

compared to the main EU economies. The relatively

good employment behaviour contributed significantly
to support private consumption, whereas low growth of
gross fixed capital formation can mostly be attributed to
negative investment in equipment due to worsened

business expectations. As a result, imports decelerated

further in the year, offsetting to some extent the

weakening of exports that mirrored the downward trend
observed in world demand. All in all, the external

contribution to GDP growth was slightly negative.
Outlook for  2003 and prospects for 2004
In 2003 private consumption is expected to gain
momentum, mainly due to implementation of the
personal income tax reform and continuing employment

creation. On the other hand, the positive effects on

disposable income stemming from reform of the
personal income tax are expected to lead to a significant
rise in the household saving rate. These trends are
foreseen to continue in 2004, with private consumption
growing by around 3% from some 2% in 2003. After

having weakened sharply in 2002, investment is

expected to gain strength in 2003, stemming mainly

from higher equipment investment as a result of
improved business prospects. On the other hand, given
the strength of construction in recent years and the brisk
increase in housing prices, a moderation of this

component is expected, although it will offset only
partially the improvement in equipment. All in all,
gross fixed capital formation should accelerate

modestly in 2003. This trend should consolidate in
2004, with  equipment investment gaining momentum.
Exports and, reflecting a slowdown in final demand,
imports are expected to fall sharply in the first half of
2003, although recovering later in the year. On balance,
the external contribution to GDP growth is expected to
be increasingly negative. 
Labour market
The deceleration of activity has slowed employment

creation. Employment growth of 1% is expected in
2003 but with this foreseen to recover above 1½% by
the end of the forecast period. Despite less buoyant

employment growth, the increase in unemployment in
2003 is expected to be limited and short-lived, with the

average rate for the year slightly above 11½%, around
0.2 percentage points above that of 2002, and falling
below 11½% (Eurostat definition) by the end of 2004.
The activity rate is expected to rise by two percentage
points over the period.
Costs and prices
Despite the relatively moderate behaviour of unit labour
costs, price developments in 2002 were worse than

expected, with the HICP inflation rate averaging 3.6%,
while core HICP inflation averaged 3.9%. The effects
of indirect tax increases at the beginning of the year and

the euro changeover effect contributed to this negative
result. Core inflation was high in the first months of

2002 although declined thereafter, while an acceleration

of prices of unprocessed food and energy in the second
half of the year maintained pressure on overall inflation.
With wages per head growing by 4% and positive

productivity growth, unit labour costs increased by just
Economic Forecasts, , Spring 2003
Spain
56over 3%, below the rise in the GDP deflator and
maintaining the trend observed in recent years. 
For 2003 HICP inflation is expected again to exceed
3%, easing further to slightly above 2½% in 2004,
provided wage moderation continues. The lack of

special factors such as those in 2002 should provide

some relief to price developments. Consequently, core

inflation is also expected to decelerate in 2003 and
2004. On the side of labour costs, the increase in
employee compensation per full-time equivalent in

2003 is expected to remain broadly stable despite a

weaker labour market than in 2002. However, the

growth in unit labour costs is expected to fall, due to

rising labour productivity, yielding a further decline in

real terms. These trends are expected to extend into 
2004, with compensation per employee and unit labour
costs moderating further.
External sector 
The current account deficit fell to 2.7% of GDP in

2002; growth of merchandise trade slumped. A

recovery of exports of goods seems to have started in
the second half of 2002 as a result of somewhat
stronger world demand, coupled with a recovery of

imports. This upward trend is expected to reverse in the
first two quarters of 2003 but to recover briskly

thereafter for both exports and imports, provided
current uncertainties are removed. The current account
deficit is foreseen to remain broadly unchanged at
around 2½% of GDP as a result of gains in the terms of
trade in both 2003 and 2004.

57Public finances 
In 2002, despite the economic slowdown, the relative
buoyancy of tax revenues, particularly corporate
income tax, and control of public consumption
contributed to alleviate pressure on the budget.

Consequently, the general government recorded only a
slight deficit of 0.1% of GDP. 
In 2003 reform of personal income tax, including
broadly-based cuts, is expected to moderate revenues.

The forecast of a less optimistic framework than that

envisaged  by  the  authorities  in  the budget  leads to a 
general government deficit of 0.4% of GDP.
Nevertheless, given the recent implementation of the
General Law of Budgetary Stability and transfer of
major spending powers to regional governments, this
forecast is necessarily subject to a high degree of
uncertainty. 
Assuming no policy changes, the budget is forecast to
record a marginal deficit in 2004, broadly in line with

Spain™s stability programme. The debt-to-GDP ratio is

expected to remain below 60% and on a declining path

throughout the forecast period, being close to 50% in

2004.

Low growth and deteriorating public finances
for a second consecutive year in 2003
The economy in the second half of 2002
Real GDP growth decelerated in the second half of
2002 to an annualised pace of 1%, down from 2¼% in
the first half. This slowdown is mainly due to the
deterioration in the external environment: a sharp
slowdown in the export market growth of the French
economy was observed from autumn 2002, and the

uncertainties surrounding the global economy weighed
on industrialists™ confidence. Business confidence was
also affected by the emergence of some liquidity and

profitability difficulties. In this context, the rapid fall in

the stock-to-GDP ratio continued and total investment

declined by ¾ percentage point per quarter in the

second half. 
The slowdown in economic activity in 2002 was
attenuated by a strong increase in public consumption,

which contributed well over half of the increase in real

GDP, at the expense of an increase in the general
government deficit. Although decelerating, private
consumption brought the second main contribution to
real GDP growth. In this context, employment creation

continued to abate and the unemployment rate to

increase.
Current situation and prospects 
Several elements currently point to a relatively weak

economic activity over the next few quarters. Since last

summer, business surveys have shown confidence

remaining low both in manufacturing, where output
expectations are today below their long-term average,
and in the service sector, where indicators are hovering
around their long-term average. These developments,

coupled with the current low level of margins, suggest
that demand from firms will remain subdued.
In the second half of 2003, a recovery in the world
economy together with a gradual decline in oil prices

and relatively favourable monetary conditions will

contribute to the improvement in demand prospects and
are expected to trigger a gradual acceleration in
economic activity from the end of 2003. Real GDP

growth would then resume to a rate close to potential in

2004.GDP components
The acceleration in export volumes from autumn 2003
should support an upturn in demand expectations, and
create the conditions for firms to slow de-stocking.

After two years of decline, productive investment is

projected to recover gradually from the end of 2003,

when the improvement in demand and profitability

prospects are confirmed and capacity utilisation rises.
The materialisation of a firm and durable recovery in
private consumption should also be relatively gradual
and not occur before the end of 2003. Indeed,

households™ real gross disposable income is currently
decelerating due to the slowdown in employment
growth, to the temporary impact of the increase in oil

prices, and to lower tax cuts. Moreover, the increase in
the unemployment rate and the general climate of
uncertainty, reflected in the evolution of consumers™

confidence, suggest that the increase in the saving rate
observed in the last few years will not be reversed until
2004. 
Labour market, costs and prices
.The deterioration in economic conditions is impacting
the labour market: employment growth was almost nil
in the second part of 2002, and is not expected to

accelerate before the beginning of 2004, when it should
remain relatively modest. This projection of a relatively

pronounced productivity cycle reflects the necessity for

companies to restore margins after the strong
contraction of the last two years, and the gradual fading
of the effects of active labour market policies. In this

context, the unemployment rate should decline only
marginally in 2004. 
Chapter 3
Member States, France
59Wage moderation is expected to continue in 2003 and
2004, even if a slight acceleration by the end of the
forecast period cannot be excluded. In 2003, the effects

of the harmonisation of the different levels of the

minimum wage created by the working time reduction
laws will be counterbalanced by a cyclical deceleration
in wages. In a context of accelerating apparent labour
productivity, growth in unit labour costs is projected to
be moderate in 2003 and 2004, in particular when

compared to the relatively dynamic increment observed
in 2001 and 2002. 
As a consequence, underlying inflationary pressures are
projected to remain limited. Price moderation will also

result from the appreciation of the euro and, after

summer 2003, the normalisation of energy and food
prices. Therefore the year-on-year rate of inflation
should decrease gradually during 2003, after the
temporary acceleration in the first few months of 2003,

which was mainly due to the impact of the sharp
increase in oil prices. Inflation is projected to remain
moderate in 2004.
Public finances
In 2002, French public finances deteriorated markedly.

According to Eurostat, the general government deficit
reached 3.1% of GDP. This outcome is to be compared
with a general government deficit of 1.4% of GDP
planned in autumn 2001 by the French authorities in the

Finance Law for 2002 and with the commitment made

by the new government in July to maintain the 2002

Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
France60general government deficit below 2.6% of GDP. The
larger part of the slippage in the 2002 general
government deficit represents a deterioration in the
cyclically-adjusted budgetary position. 
Under current policies, French public finances are
expected to deteriorate further in 2003. The general
government deficit is projected by the Commission to
reach 3.7% of GDP. Indeed, the budget for 2003 does
not contain measures sizeably reducing the cyclically-
adjusted deficit and unfavourable cyclical developments

will continue weighing on fiscal revenues. The general
government debt is projected to increase from 59.1% of
GDP to 61.8% of GDP, also due to the impact of the

subscription by the State to the recapitalisation of

France Telecom worth 0.6 percentage point of GDP.

This is the only financial transaction impacting on the

debt ratio in this forecast.
The forecast for 2003 is based on the assumption that
general government  expenditures in real terms are kept
broadly in line with plans, apart from those influenced
by the economic cycle, namely unemployment benefits,
and apart from a further slippage in the health sector.  
In 2004, despite the acceleration in economic activity to
a close-to-potential rate, the general government deficit
is projected to decrease only marginally to 3.5% of
GDP. The decline in the deficit will be burdened next
year by the lagged impact on fiscal revenues of the low
2003 GDP growth. Given that no budget has been voted

for 2004, a crucial assumption of this forecast is that
real government expenditures are projected to increase
by 1.9% in real terms, to be compared with a projection

of 1.4% embodied in the last update of the stability

programme. The projected increase in expenditures is

lower than that observed since the inception of stability

programmes, in order to take into account the positive
structural effects of the measures taken in 2002 on
health expenditures and on unemployment benefits.

Gradual recovery expected to potential growth
Domestic demand was subdued in 2002 and, while
private consumption is forecast to recover somewhat, a

further moderation is expected to occur in 2003 in view
of limited public consumption and negative investment
growth. The contribution to growth from net exports

was very strong in 2002, owing mainly to weak

imports, and is forecast to remain positive but less

pronounced in 2003. As a result, real GDP growth is

forecast to fall from around 6% in 2002 to 3.3% in
2003. For 2004, the strengthening world economy
should deliver a further pick-up in Irish activity, leading

to GDP growth of 4.5%. The forecast in GNI terms sees
a gradual recovery from a trough in 2002.
Activity in 2002
Real GDP growth is expected to have averaged some
6% in 2002, in line with preliminary national accounts
for the first three quarters and similar to 2001, when

growth reached 5.7%. With the exception of public
consumption, domestic demand was weak in 2002. The
strong economic performance thus mainly stemmed
from a very high contribution of net exports, which
itself was due more to weak imports than to buoyant
exports, although exports of chemicals and of computer

services both grew strongly. The fall-off in imports

reflected the weakness of domestic demand and very
subdued imports of trade-related and other business
services. Industry was the strongest sector in 2002 but

industrial employment shrank because output gains
were concentrated in the chemicals sector, which is not

labour-intensive. As the sector is also largely foreign-
owned, the impact on Irish incomes of its production
boom is likely to have been limited. Given the
dominance of such foreign-owned companies in

Ireland, it is useful also to consider the change in gross
national income (GNI). In 2002, an unusually wide gap
seems to have arisen between GNI and GDP growth in
view of strong growth in profit outflows and a sharp
fall-off in inflows. Real GNI is estimated to have
expanded by some 2%, far weaker than in 2001 (4.5%).
The economy in 2003
Domestic demand is forecast to slow further in 2003.
Private consumption is expected to recover somewhat
but to remain fairly soft, given more moderate
disposable income gains than in the recent past, as

growth of employment and earnings per capita eases off

and the scale of direct tax relief is very modest.

Reflecting the announced cap on public sector

employment, public consumption is expected to make
only a marginal contribution to growth. Overall fixed
investment is forecast to shrink, because the projected
recovery in investment in equipment (after two years of

negative growth) should be more than offset by a drop

in construction investment. Growth in housing
completions is assumed to taper off as supply
constraints start to hit and demand eases due partly to

an assumed slowing in net immigration and public

investment was cut by 1% in nominal terms in the

budget.  
The contribution of the external side to growth is
forecast to be less pronounced than in 2002.
Merchandise exports are expected to stage a modest
recovery in line with the international upturn. As the
import intensity of economic activity recovers,

merchandise imports should also pick up after two

years of negative growth. Services credits are expected
to continue to post strong growth rates, while debits are
forecast to recover gradually from an exceptionally
weak 2002.
Taken together, growth is forecast to accelerate as the
year progresses and to average 3.3% in GDP terms.
With net profit outflows expected to grow less
Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
Ireland
62dramatically than in 2002, GNI growth is forecast to
improve to just below 3%. 
Outlook for 2004
The strengthening of the international pick-up in
activity in 2004 is expected to pave the way for a
further recovery driven by exports and investment.
Reflecting improved economic conditions, a modest fall

in the savings rate should also support private

consumption. By year-end, growth should be close to

that commonly thought to be sustainable in the medium
term, of some 5% in annualised terms, but, for the year
as a whole, the rate of expansion, at 4.5% in GDP
terms, will fall somewhat short of this new rate of
potential growth for the Irish economy.
Labour market
The unemployment rate has displayed a moderate
upward trend since reaching a trough of 3.8% during

the first half of 2001 and stood at 4.5% in

January/February 2003. The rise in 2002 was stemmed
by strong public sector employment growth; excluding
the public sector, employment was flat. With the
announced cap on public employment, continued weak

activity is forecast to lead to employment growth well

below labour force growth in 2003, entailing a fairly

Member States, Ireland
63sharp rise in unemployment, to some 5½%. In 2004,
however, the unemployment rate should stabilise. The

forecast assumes moderating net immigration flows and
slowing population growth.
Costs and prices
Growth in compensation per employee is estimated to
have peaked in 2001, at more than 9%. In (delayed)

response to weaker activity since early 2001 and in
spite of continuing high inflation, wage inflation

appears to have eased markedly in 2002. The forecast
assumes a further gradual moderation to 2004, although
earnings growth is expected to remain among the

highest in the euro area because of a relatively tight
labour market and high inflation.
Like the previous budget, the budget for 2003
introduced a range of indirect tax increases which are

estimated to add just under 1 percentage point to the
inflation rate. Various increases in user charges are also

putting upward pressure on prices. This is expected to
partly counteract the downward pressures stemming
from weak activity, easing earnings growth and a
stronger currency, so that HICP inflation is forecast to

fall from 4.7% in 2002 to 4.2% in 2003. In the absence

of further significant indirect tax increases, inflation

should ease more markedly in 2004 and the differential

with the euro area average should narrow further.
External accounts
The combined external trade and services balance (as a

percentage of GDP) continues to rise over theforecast
period, although individual components do not follow
their respective trends: weak trade is estimated to stem
the gradual rise in the trade balance (in 2002-2003) as
well as the steady deterioration of the services deficit.
With a widening income deficit, the balance of
payments is forecast to record a small deficit in 2002-
2003 but in 2004 the overall balance should be in the
black again thanks to the trade balance resuming its
upward trend. 
Public finances
The budget for 2003 implemented various revenue-

raising measures, while, on the spending side, growth in
current discretionary expenditure was nearly halved
(from 15% in 2002 to 8%) and capital outlays were cut.
The deficit is forecast to attain 0.6% of GDP, somewhat
better than estimated by the authorities in March

(0.8%). Given the non-indexed tax and social benefit

system, the no-policy change assumption for 2004 is
made operational by freezing average tax rates and
adjusting social transfer payments by the forecast CPI

inflation rate (with a small top-up). The projections for

2004 take account of the gradual implementation of the

ﬁbenchmarkingﬂ recommendations (upward

adjustments to public sector pay scales from a
comparison with rates for similar jobs in the private
sector), as foreseen in the new national agreement, and

do not include any contingency provisions. On these

assumptions, the deficit is forecast to widen to 0.9% of

GDP, while the debt-to-GDP ratio broadly stabilises at

around 33% over the forecast horizon.

Frailty extends well into 2003 
Real GDP is projected to increase by only 1% in 2003, half
of which is carried over from 2002. An acceleration,
sustained by domestic demand, is expected in 2004 in the

context of a more general revival in the external

environment. Echoing economic activity, job creation in

2003 is forecast to weaken, halting the downward trend in

the rate of unemployment. Inflation is expected to ease

slowly under the rival influences of high energy prices and
rising spare capacity. 
Activity in 2002
Following the slowdown in 2001, real GDP remained flat
in the first quarter of 2002 before embarking on a cautious

growth path in the remainder of the year. In 2002 as a

whole economic growth averaged 0.4%, on account of

reviving final domestic demand and stock-building. The

recovery of domestic demand was particularly evident in

the second half of 2002 when private consumption surged

despite low confidence levels and accelerating inflation.

The increase in consumption was essentially due to

durable goods, helped by a fiscal incentive for car
purchases. Also helped by a tax incentive, investment
expenditure turned out even more buoyant, as firms

brought foreword expenditure plans to take advantage of
the so-called ﬁTremontiﬂ law, which expired at the end of
December. However, stronger final demand failed to boost

production as a large part went into higher imports. The
contribution to growth of net exports was negative.
Economic outlook in 2003 and prospects for 2004 
The short-term outlook in 2003 remains bleak, with no
signs of a swift revival in sight. Industrial production is not

expected to pick up before the second quarter and

indicators of economic activity in the service sector, the

sole driving force of growth in 2002, weakened at the

beginning of the year. In spite of the prospect of weak

expansion over the course of 2003, economic growth is

expected to come close to 1% in the year as a whole,

thanks to a carry-over effect of half a decimal point from

2002. In 2004, growth is forecast to rise slightly above 2%

in the context of a general improvement of the external
economic environment.
As regards GDP components, 2003 is likely to start with a
marked weakening of final domestic demand. Private
consumption is forecast to recoil following the sharp hike

in the final months of 2002.Moreover, the expansionary

effect of the income tax cut in the 2003 budget is

diminished by payments related to the budget™s broad

series of tax amnesties and settlements. The bringing

forward of investment plans in the second half of 2002
coupled with the bleak economic outlook is also set to
trigger a negative reaction of investment expenditure, also

corroborated by a further decline in the level of capacity

utilisation at the end of 2002. Investment is expected to

pick up again in the second half of 2003. The external side

will continue to weigh on economic growth, partially

offsetting the expansion of domestic demand. The negative

contribution from net exports is due to the strong

appreciation of the euro amplified by the price sensitivity

of labour-intensive Italian exports. In 2004 domestic

demand is projected to strengthen on account of recovering

confidence along with some improvement in export

growth in the context of a general recovery in the global
economic environment.
Labour market
Although slowing over the course of the year employment
creation continued in 2002. The number of jobs rose by

1.1% compared with 0.3% in the euro area as a whole,

confirming the resilience observed in recent years

following the successive steps of labour marker reform

started in 1998. The rate of unemployment averaged 9%,
down from 9.4% in 2001.
However, the sluggish pace of economic growth is likely
to leave its mark on the labour market in 2003 as

employment expectations of  manufacturing and service

firms eased towards the end of 2002. The number of full-

time equivalents is predicted to increase by only 0.4% in

2003 as a whole, before growing stronger again in 2004.

The employment headcount, as measured by the labour

force survey, will be slightly more buoyant due to recourse

to part-time contracts. Moreover, new legislation passed in

2002 aimed at legalising illegal immigrants attracted an

unexpectedly high number of applications, amounting to
Chapter 3
Member States, Italy
65around 3% of employment. To the extent that applicants
are accepted statistics for resident population and the

labour force will increase. The effect on measured

employment is likely to be spread across several years, as

the processing of the applications is reported to be slow.

With some lag compared to economic growth, the rate of

unemployment is forecast to creep up over the course of

2003, averaging 9.1% in the year as a whole, marginally
up from 2002, and to resume the downward trend in 2004.
Costs and prices
In 2002, despite significant demand slack and government
action in late August aimed at freezing controlled prices of

public services for the remainder of the year, inflationary

pressure failed to ease, actually rising towards the end of
the year. The annual average increase in the HICP was
2.6%, 0.4pp higher than in the euro area as a whole. 
After accelerating to 3.0% in December 2002, annual
HICP inflation started to ease at the beginning of 2003,

helped by a favourable comparison with the months of the

euro changeover one year earlier. However, while a

widening negative output gap, the stronger euro and rising

labour productivity will lower inflationary pressure in the

remainder of 2003, the high starting point and higher oil

prices are likely to keep HICP inflation well above 2% on

average. Despite worsened industrial relations the renewal

of important wage contracts in 2003 is assumed to remain

in line with the track record of wage moderation observed

since the early 1990s. Inflation is forecast to stay on a

declining path up until early 2004 as the output gap

remains negative and oil prices return to OPEC™s preferred

Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
Italy
66price band of $22-28. In 2004 HICP inflation is forecast to
average below 2%. 
Public finances
After a deficit of 2.6% of GDP in 2001, in 2002 the deficit
was 2.3% (EDP definition). The primary surplus declined

from 3.8% to 3.4% of GDP. The budgetary outcome

benefited from one-off measures which improved the

general government balance by one percentage point of

GDP (0.9% sales of publicly-owned real estate and 0.1% a

tax amnesty on assets held abroad). Thanks to significantly

lower interest rates, interest expenditure was 0.7

percentage points of GDP lower than the previous year.

Legislation enforced in the second half of the year also

positively contributed to the 2002 budgetary result. The

government debt ratio fell to 106.7% of GDP from 109.5%

in 2001, thanks also to a conversion operation carried out

at the end of the year, which reduced the face value of the
debt by 1.9% of GDP.
In 2003, the general government deficit is forecast to
stabilise at the same level as the previous year, again on

the back of substantial temporary measures, estimated to

have a positive impact of 1.2% of GDP on the budget

balance (0.6% sales of real estate and 0.6% from various

tax amnesties). With interest rates at historically low

levels, interest payments are expected to keep declining

significantly relative to GDP. The primary surplus is

forecast to continue to deteriorate, edging down to 3% of

GDP. Adjusting for the economic cycle, the budget deficit

in 2003 would improve by 0.3 percentage points of GDP;
the primary surplus would remain broadly stable. 
The Commission forecast is aligned with the officially
estimated impact of a number of measures introduced in

the Budget Law for 2003. This includes a series of tax

settlements and amnesties, all of which have largely

transitory effects and are subject to equal measures of

upside and downside risks. However, in contrast with the

official forecast, planned savings in government purchases

of goods and services and in subsidies to enterprises are

estimated to total 0.6% of GDP. The forecast also assumes

increased social security contributions resulting from

measures taken in 2002 to regularise the position of
immigrant workers.
The forecast for 2004 is based on legislation currently in
force: in the absence of new policy measures the deficit
would touch 3% of GDP. Tax and social security

contributions receipts are consistent with the

macroeconomic framework and with the estimated effects

of the measures in the Budget Law for 2003. Other

revenues and non-interest expenditures are forecast on the

basis of the trends underlying the updated official

projections for 2003-2006 released in September. The rate

of increase of compensation of employees has been

adjusted for the assumption that part of the increases from

the new wage settlement will slide to 2004. Gross fixed

capital formation reflects much lower sales of real assets.

Capital receiptsreflect the expiration of one-off revenue
measures. 
During the forecast period the debt ratio is expected to
continue to decline slowly.

Succession of weaker years after golden decade
The economy in 2002 and 2003
In the 10 years from 1991 to 2000, real GDP growth in
Luxembourg averaged 5.4%, well above the EU

average. In 2001, economic growth slowed down very

markedly, to 1.0%, in response to the slowdown in the
world economy and the turmoil on financial markets.
The negative external shocks first affected exposed

sectors such as manufacturing and finance. The adverse

impact of developments in financial markets was more

profound in Luxembourg than in many other EU

countries, due to the large size of the financial sector. In
2002 and 2003, the slowdown in activity progressively
spread to sheltered sectors of the economy, in particular

to labour-intensive commercial services that are highly

dependent on the financial sector. Overall real GDP
growth is estimated to have been around 0.4% in 2002.
This is somewhat higher than forecast in the autumn of
last year mainly due to a steeper than expected fall in
imports and to some signs of a bottoming out of activity
in some sectors towards the end of 2002.
The first months of 2003 show some tentative signs of a
bottoming-out in industry. Banks appear to have been
successful in reducing costs in 2002, but adjustment in

many other sectors should continue over most of the
forecast horizon. That said, the earlier reduction of

corporate tax rates should have a positive impact on
economic activity, even though this is difficult to
quantify. Real GDP growth in 2003 is forecast at close
to 1%, but the high exposure of the economy of
developments in the highly volatile financial sector

makes for a large margin of uncertainty surrounding

this estimate.
As regards trends in expenditure, private consumption
growth is forecast to remain weak in 2003, at around
1½%, as is evident from weak retail sales into the early

months of this year. Lacklustre private consumption
growth reflects the slowdown in the labour market, the
decline in consumer confidence and higher household

savings. The growth rate of real government

consumption should remain high over the forecast
horizon. Weak profits, the need to cut down costs and
uncertainty as regards the near-term outlook should
continue to put downward pressure on corporate
investment, even though the growth rate of real public
investment should remain high, at around 9%. 
Prospects for 2004
In 2004, economic activity is forecast to recover on the
back of the expected pick up in world demand.
However, the pick up in the rate of real GDP growth, to
2.7%, would be relatively slow compared to previous
cyclical upturns, as key sectors of the economy,

including the financial sector, are expected to recover

only gradually. Private non-residential capital formation

is expected to recover gradually in the course of 2004 in

line with the upturn in domestic and external demand,
whereas public investment should remain strong. The
net export contribution should rise in line with the
recovery of world trade. Total investment is expected to
grow by 3.6%. 
Labour market developments
The labour market responds to the economic slowdown
with a lag. In Luxembourg, cross-border employment is

highly sensitive to cyclical conditions and the sharp
deceleration in the inflow of cross-border workers in
the course of 2002 illustrates the turnaround in the
labour market. Total employment growth is forecast to

decelerate to around 1% in both 2003 and 2004.

Whereas consolidation measures in the manufacturing
and banking sectors already led to substantial job losses
in those sectors in 2002, redundancies are expected to
spread to other more shielded sectors in the course of
2003 and 2004. This should lead to a rise in the number

of resident unemployed, even though this increase is

likely to be cushioned by the specific measures for the
unemployed already in place. Nevertheless, the
unemployment rate is expected to increase appreciably
over the forecast horizon, to 3.7% in 2004.
Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
Luxembourg
68Costs and prices
HICP inflation is expected to decelerate over the
forecast horizon from 2.1% in 2003 to 1.6% in 2004.
This reflects inter alia the pass-through of declines in
import prices, weak demand conditions, and the fading

of the upward impact on inflation of the introduction of

the cash euro. According to a study carried out jointly
by STATEC and the Banque Central du Luxembourg
the cash changeover led to a cumulative increase of
consumer prices of around 0.7 percentage point
between January 2001 and July 2002. The cyclical

pickup in productivity and relatively moderate wage

increases (in response to the weakening labour market)

are expected to contribute also to lower price pressures.
Public finances
The government accounts remained in surplus in 2002:
net lending of general government amounted to 2.6% of
GDP, compared to 6.4% in 2001. The outcome for 2002
was more favourable than previously expected, largely
owing to strong corporate tax revenues reflecting the

lagged response of tax receipts to changes in the growth
rate, to some increase in the collection of tax arrears,

and to lower-than-expected expenditure from special
funds. In 2003 and 2004, the general government
balance is expected to deteriorate to a deficit of 0.2%
and 1.2% of GDP respectively. This reflects the lagged

impact of the economic slowdown on tax revenue and

social security contributions, a fading of the impact of

collecting corporate taxes still due from years with

Adverse developments in the central government
accounts will account for most of the deterioration of
the general government balance in 2003 and 2004,
while local government revenues should be affected 
negatively by the effects of the earlier tax reforms from
2004 onwards. By contrast, the balance of social
security funds should still be positive, albeit to a lesser
extent than in recent years. The already low gross

government debt ratio is forecast to decline somewhat
further to 3.4% of GDP in 2004.

7010.The Netherlands
Deterioration of public finances in response to sluggish growth
The situation in 2003 
Following a number of years in which real GDP growth
exceeded the EU average, the Dutch economy is
experiencing a sharp slowdown. In 2002 real GDP

growth was no more than 0.3%, compared to 1.3% in

2001. As elsewhere in the EU, the slowdown in activity

was initially driven by the deceleration in international
trade. The deterioration in external competitiveness, the
consequent losses in export market share and the

appreciation of the euro contributed to the slowdown in

exports. The cyclical downturn worsened in the wake of
a marked slowdown in domestic demand and
substantial destocking. In 2003, economic growth is
expected to remain weak, at 0.5%. Private consumption
growth is forecast to remain modest, growing by less

than 1%, reflecting significant declines in consumer

confidence, a fall in employment and rising
unemployment, and the downward impact of tax
increases on household real disposable income.
Household income will also be affected negatively by
substantial increases in pension premiums, as many

pension funds faced a fall of reserves below required

minimum levels due to the decline in equity prices. In
addition, the slump on equity markets and the
moderation on the housing market are expected to lead
to an end to the wealth effects that boosted private
consumption between the mid-1990s and the year 2000.

Due to restraints on government spending in the 2003

budget, the growth rate of real government
consumption would decrease markedly to 0.0%,
compared to close to 4% in 2002. Weak profits, low
business confidence and uncertainty as regards the near-
term outlook would continue to put downward pressure

on corporate investment, even though housing

investment is expected to accelerate. The contribution
of inventories to real GDP growth is expected to turn
slightly positive in 2003, following the drag on growth
put in 2002 during the downward phase of the inventory
cycle. 
The situation in the labour market is expected to worsen
progressively, responding to the cyclical downturn with

a lag. 
Hesitant recovery in 2004
A rebound in domestic demand and some pick up in

export growth would lead to a modest upturn, already
starting in the course of 2003 onwards. Real GDP
growth is expected to reach 1.7% in 2004. Private

consumption growth is expected to increase only
modestly to 1.5%, despite a drop in inflation, due to the
fading of negative wealth effects, the worsening labour

market, and further increases in pension premiums.

Private non-residential capital formation is expected to

recover gradually in the course of 2004 and grow by

around 2%, in line with the modest upturn in domestic
and external demand. On the external side, export
growth is expected to increase to 5.1% in 2004 in
response to projected developments in world demand.

However, the recovery of net exports would be
relatively muted compared to previous cyclical

upswings, as losses in competitiveness not only dampen
the recovery of exports, but also lead to a gradual
increase in import penetration. 
Employment and unemployment
Total employment is forecast to decrease by 0.4% in
2003 and to stagnate in 2004. This reflects the lagged

response of the labour market to the economic

slowdown. The turnaround in the labour market lead to
a significant increase in the unemployment rate over the
forecast horizon, by around 2.5 percentage point to

5.1% in 2004. The lag with which employment growth
responds to the slowdown in activity should be longer

than usual, due to ‚labour hoarding™ in a labour market,
which has been very tight in recent years. It is
envisaged that labour supply will grow at lower rates
than witnessed in the second half of the 1990s, partly
because of demographic factors. Consequently, the

unemployment rate should continue to increase in 2004,

in spite of the expected cyclical recovery.
Chapter 3
Member States, The Netherlands
71Costs and prices
HICP inflation is expected to decrease markedly over
the forecast horizon, from 3.9% in 2002 to 2.7% in

2003 and 1.5% in 2004. This is due to a combination of

factors, including the impact of lower import prices,
and a substantial easing of unit labour costs. The latter
reflects more moderate wage developments in response
to weak growth and rising unemployment, along with a

cyclical recovery in labour productivity growth. That
said, increases in pension premiums are expected to
offset part of the beneficial effect of easing wage

increases on labour costs. Base effects associated with
the cash changeover to the euro, the liberalisation of the
gas market for consumers, an intended decrease in

petrol taxes, and the fading of some other special
factors that put upward pressure on prices in 2002 will
also contribute to the deceleration of inflation.
Public finances
The fiscal accounts deteriorated substantially in 2002
,after having reached a surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2001.
In 2002, provisional data show a general government
deficit of 1.1% of GDP. The deterioration of public
finances mainly reflects the operation of automatic

stabilisers in a weak economic environment, as well as

the lagged impact of tax reforms and some revenue

shortfalls related to increases in pension premiums.

Significant tax increases and expenditure cuts are being
introduced in 2003
. Revenue increasing measures
include, among other things, the elimination of some

Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
The Netherlands
72income tax deductible items and fast increasing health
care contributions. On the other hand, tax receipts are

depressed by substantial increases in pension

contributions. Expenditure reductions stem, inter alia,
from cuts in the number of civil servants and reduced
eligibility for unemployment schemes. The weak
economic environment implies a further deterioration of

the general government balance in 2003, to a deficit of
1.6% of GDP.  The fiscal outlook for 2004 is highly

uncertain at the time of writing, as negotiations to form
a new coalition government following the general
elections of 22 January 2002 are still ongoing. Under
the technicalassumption of no policy changes, the
general government balance deteriorates in 2004, to a
deficit of 2.4% of GDP. Thus, the budgetary position of

the Netherlands would have deteriorated in a few years
from a small surplus in 2001 to a substantial deficit.
Under a no policy change assumption, the cyclically
adjusted general government balance also deteriorates
from 2003 to 2004.
1 As a result of projected deficits and
low economic growth the gross government debt ratio
will increase  slightly in 2004, to 52.8% of GDP. An
incoming government will most likely announce
consolidation measures. Hence, for 2004 the current
projected deficit could be interpreted as an upper bound
to expected deficits.
                                                          
1Note that the forecast horizon here covers the period up to
2004. Forecasts for the Netherlands by some other institutions
may cover a longer time horizon, as may multi-annual
projections used, for instance, to prepare stability
programmes. Owing to the characteristics of the estimation

method, the outcome for the cyclically adjusted balance in

any year will change when the forecast horizon is altered.
This is the case even if the same input data would be used for
the period up to and including 2004.

Slow recovery in investment dampens growth
Developments in 2002
Despite having accelerated slightly, the economic
performance in 2002 was rather disappointing, because

of a weakening in domestic components, due to

sluggish household demand and a sharper-than-
anticipated fall in investment. Exports, by contrast,
although decelerating significantly, developed more

favourably than expected thanks to firm demand from

central and eastern Europe. Due to a slump in imports,

the growth contribution of the external sector increased

markedly. 
Private consumption grew at a modest rate, with
disposable income of households being squeezed by
weak employment growth, rising unemployment and
higher-than-anticipated inflation.Investment took a
dive, with equipment investment plunging due to
deteriorating demand expectations, and, possibly, due to

having partly been postponed in anticipation of a tax
incentive favouring investment undertaken in the year

2003. Construction continued to suffer from excess
supply and budgetary restraint, although benefiting, to
some extent, from the flood disaster hitting Austria in
August 2002. Overall, at 1.0%, output growth in 2002
remained close to the modest expansion of the previous
year.
Inflation declined in the course of the year, decelerating
by 0.6 percentage points compared with 2001 to 1.7%
on average. Weak output growth led to a sharp increase

in unemployment, with the jobless rate staying

nonetheless significantly below the EU15-average. 
Prospects
The economic recovery is weaker than earlier expected
due to the delay in the international upswing. Although
accelerating slightly in 2003, GDP growth will resume

its trend rate only in 2004, thanks to strengthening
domestic demand and the expected rebound in exports.

Real GDP growth in 2003 is forecast to move up to

around 1¼% and to improve further to a rate of 2% in

2004. 
Demand components
Household real disposable income should expand only

moderately in 2003, owing to unfavourable labour

market conditions, before accelerating in 2004, thanks
to rising employment and despite sticky inflation. As a
result, private consumption, albeit picking up slightly in
2003, is expected to rebound only in 2004. Public

consumption is forecast to remain rather subdued

throughout the projection period, assuming that the

government will make efforts to control budgetary

spending. After a nose-dive in 2002,  investment should
recover, if slowly, in 2003 before gaining momentum in
2004, reflecting the improved outlook for exports.

Construction investment, in particular civil engineering

but also housing construction, is projected to benefit to
some extent from the flood disaster of last summer,
with a turnaround of the downward trend expected as of
2003. Although recovering, equipment investment is
expected to remain subdued in 2003 reflecting both the

delay in the economic upswing and sufficient unused

capacity. Towards the end of the year, however, firms,
considering the improved economic outlook, could try
to take advantage of a tax incentive applicable in 2003
and bring forward investments. Although exports are
expected to gain momentum, they should not come into

full swing before 2004. With imports also accelerating,

reflecting the improvement in domestic demand, the
contribution of net exports to GDP growth should turn
neutral as of 2003.
Prices and wages
Consumer price inflation is likely to remain rather

sticky throughout the forecast period in 2003 due to the

increase in oil prices and despite decelerating unit
labour costs in 2004 due to an increase in energy taxes. 
Nominal increases in contractual wages in 2003 remain
below those of the previous year. In 2004, although

wage moderation in the private sector is expected to

continue, the cyclical upswing should lead to somewhat

higher wage settlements. In the public sector, however,
Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
Austria
74given that the wage increase for 2001-02 was very
moderate and entailed significant losses in real terms,
an additional pay-rise to partly compensate for

purchasing power losses, is expected for 2003. Overall,

wage growth in 2003 should be below that of 2002 and
step up somewhat  in 2004.
Labour market
In 2002, sl
uggish output growth had an adverse impact
on the labour market, with both dependent and self-
employment declining noticeably. With overall output
growth remaining subdued in 2003 and given the usual
time lag of about six months, a more sustained pick-up
in labour demand can be expected only in the course of

2004, when the economic activity should have gained
momentum.Total employment growth in 2003 is
expected to be dampened by a continued fall in self-
employment before strengthening in 2004. As of 2003,

labour supply is forecast to change in line with the

business cycle, contrary to the counter-cyclical
expansion observed in the recent past. Reflecting the
projected tendencies of labour demand and supply, the
sharp rise in unemployment registered in 2002 is
expected to decelerate significantly in 2003 before
slowly turning around in 2004. 
Current accountIn 2002, export growth in combination with a fall in
imports yielded a trade surplus, which is a noteworthy

event. Despite a pick-up in domestic demand as of 2003

75and a projected acceleration in merchandise imports,
the trade balance could remain in surplus, albeit

declining. As regards the services balance, however,
preliminary national accounts data for 2002 appears to
be at odds with current account figures as published by
the central bank. Preliminary national accounts figures

indicate that the traditional Austrian services surplus

turned into a deficit, which is rather puzzling. Current

account data on an accruals basis up the third quarter
plus the preliminary data on a cash basis for the last
three months, by contrast, suggest that the services
balance in 2002 could have remained in surplus.

Although the official current account figures for 2002

will be published only at the end of April, a revision of
the national accounts data would not come as a surprise.  
Public finances
In 2002, the budgetary position weakened by almost
one percentage point of GDP to a deficit of 0.6% after a
surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2001 (figures in EDP
definition, i.e. including swap operations), although
output growth accelerated slightly to 1.0% from 0.7%
in 2001. This result falls short of the stability
programme target (-0.2% of GDP) set in the low growth

scenario (assuming real GDP growth at 0.9%). While,

in 2001, a strong rise in tax revenues helped to improve

the cyclically-adjusted position despite low output

growth, the particularly weak domestic demand in 2002
depressed tax revenues. However, a marked increase in
ﬁother revenuesﬂ and a lower-than-anticipated rise in

expenditures Œ partly due to the flood disaster, which,
contrarytoearlierexpectations, had virtually no 
budgetary impact in 2002 - entailed a more benign
budgetary outcome than projected by the Austrian
authorities and forecast by the Commission  last
autumn. This result was achieved despite a decline in
the surplus at the Länder level. 
In 2003, the continued alleviating effects of the pension
reform 2000 and the cuts in personnel are projected to
be offset by additional labour market expenditure, as
foreseen in the fiscal stimulus package
,topped by
flood-related spending, under the assumption that the
emergency funds unspent in 2002 will be released in

2003. The tax intake should reflect the rather bleak
cyclical situation, despite some pick-up in domestic
components. Public sector employees are expected to

be granted an additional pay rise, making up for past

purchasing power losses. In summary, the expected

delay in the cyclical upswing and hence employment

growth as well as the continued, if small, rise in
unemployment, should cause the deficit in 2003 to
widen to around 1% of GDP before narrowing again in

2004. In keeping with the Commission™s no-policy-

change assumption, the projection for 2004 does not

incorporate the tax reform, which is planned but has not

yet been decided. 
The government finances forecast for 2003 and 2004 is
subject to great uncertainty, since only a few concrete

measures were known at the cut-off date. Due to delays

in the formation of a government after parliamentary
elections held on 24 November 2002, the budget for
2003, and also 2004, was in the drafting process at the
cut-off date and should be adopted around mid-June.

Further adjustment towards more sustainable levels of domestic demand 
The Portuguese economy
The Portuguese economy is undergoing a process of
adjustment. Following a period of strong growth driven

by domestic demand (real economic growth averaged

4% in the 1995-2000 period), a number of imbalances

have emerged in the Portuguese economy, notably a
significant external deficit in percentage of GDP, a rise
in the credit-to-income ratios in the private sector above

the average level in the euro-area, and a gradual
deterioration in the underlying budgetary position,
which led to the excessive deficit in 2001. The strong

rise in indebtedness in the private sector of the economy
is a new phenomenon, the correction of which is likely
to lengthen the period of economic recovery beyond
what would be normally expected from the
developments in the external environment. 
GDP growth decelerated from 3.7% in the 1999-2000
period to 1.6% in 2001 and to an estimated ½% in

2002. The weakness of economic activity in the second
half of 2002, in line with the slowdown in the EU,

limits considerably the growth prospects for 2003. The
adjustment in all major components of domestic
demand is projected to carry on in 2003. While in the
2001-2002 period private consumption was particularly
affected by the decline in the demand for durable

goods, in 2003 the demand for non-durables is also

expected to falter as the situation in the labour market
deteriorated rapidly at the end of 2002. Investment in
both construction and equipment is expected to recede

for a second consecutive year in 2003, according to the
available quantitative and qualitative indicators. Public
consumption growth is projected to slowdown during

the forecast period, following the ongoing budgetary
adjustment. Overall, domestic demand is forecast to
recede again in 2003 by about ¼%, following a

contraction of some ½% in 2002. Consequently, import

growth is expected to virtually stagnate in 2003, which

together with the re-orientation of production towards

foreign markets and a certain degree of wage
moderation is forecast to stimulate export growth, thus
leading to an improvement in the external balance. The
contribution of net exports to growth is expected to
remain at about ¾ pp of GDP in 2003, becoming the
driving force of economic activity throughout the
forecast period.
A moderate pick-up is expected only from the second
half of 2003 onwards, reflecting the gradual
improvement of economic conditions in Europe, which
is expected to strengthen the export sector. For the

whole of 2003, GDP growth is expected at around ½%,
partly due to the negative carry over from 2002,
accelerating to about 2% in 2004. Domestic demand is
forecast to resume growth only in 2004. This is mainly

due to continued efforts by private sector agents to
redress their balance sheets, following the sharp rise in
indebtedness in recent years. The external deficit is

therefore forecast to nearly halve between 2002 and
2004, declining to a value close to 3¼% of GDP in
2004.GDP components 
Private consumption is expected to remain virtually flat
in 2003, reflecting the rise in unemployment, the lower
wage increases, and the historically low levels of
confidence. Total investment is forecast to decline
further in 2003, reflecting adverse cyclical conditions,
together with the reduction in public investment not

co-financed by EU funds due to budgetary constraints.

Growth in total investment is only expected to turn
positive in 2004. Export market growth is estimated to
accelerate sharply from 1% in 2002 to approximately
5½% on average in the 2003-2004 period. The rebound
in foreign demand is expected to lead to a rise in

exports as market shares are projected to remain

broadly unchanged in 2003-2004 after the gains
registered in 2001-2002. The total import elasticity of
final demand is estimated to decline in 2002-2003,
because of the marked slowdown in demand for
durables which have a high import content. With the
Chapter 3
Member States, Portugal
77revival of investment and exports, the import elasticity
should edge up again at the end of the forecast period.
Overall, the contribution of total net exports to GDP
growth is forecast to be between ½% and ¾% per year

over the forecast period. 
Prices 
HICP inflation is forecast to decelerate markedly in the

second half of 2003, following the rise in 2002 which
was largely caused by temporary effects as the 2
percentage points rise in the standard VAT rate to 19%

as from mid 2002. Moderate import price inflation, low

wage increases, and subdued domestic demand

throughout the forecast period are all expected to
contribute to dampen inflation from about 3.7% in 2002
to a projected 2¼% in 2004. 
Labour Market
The labour market deteriorated rapidly at the end of
2002, with the unemployment rate jumping to 6.2% in
the fourth quarter (2 percentage points more than a year
earlier). This reflects basically a markedly deceleration

in employment creation from 1.4% in 2001 to 0.2% in

2002. This adverse trend is projected to continue during
the forecast period, with the unemployment rate
expected to exceed 7% in 2004, which is clearly above
the estimated NAIRU. The easing in labour market
conditions combined with possible spill-over effects

from the planned lower pay rises in the public sector are
expected to bring about lower wage increases in the

Portugal
78private sector of the economy. The total wage per
employee is expected to decelerate from about 5¼% in

2002 to 2¼% in 2004, thus contributing to an
improvement in price-competitiveness. 
Public finances 
The general government deficit in 2002 (the EDP
definition) attained 2.7% of GDP, down from 4.2% in

2001. The government deficit target of 2.8% of GDP
for 2002 was therefore met despite the unfavourable
starting point, and the gradual weakening of cyclical
conditions during the year. This reflects the firm

commitment of the Portuguese authorities to correct the 
excessive deficit as soon as possible with a view to
regaining policy credibility and preserving the political

momentum towards budgetary consolidation. That
momentum was initiated with the approval of the

rectifying budget for 2002, and continued with the

political commitments made in response to the Council

recommendation addressed to Portugal in the

framework of the excessive deficit procedure. However,
compliance with the deficit target for 2002 was only
made possible due to the significant amount of one-off
measures taken, totalling about 1½% of GDP.
The government deficit forecast for 2003 takes fully
into account the state budget for that year. The 2003
budget   includes   a   number  of   restrictive  measures, 
notably an increase in personal income tax brackets
below expected inflation, a substantial increase in

instalment payments on account of annual corporate

taxes, a moderate growth in investment expenditure,

and a virtual wage freeze in the government sector.
However, despite the marked restrictive nature of the
budget, the government deficit for 2003 is forecast by
the Commission at 3½% of GDP, which is above the

official target of 2.4%. This difference is basically the

outcome of two factors: first, economic activity is

forecast to be significantly weaker in 2003 than initially
projected in the 2003 budget (0.5% as against 1.3%,
respectively), which should cause a considerable tax
shortfall; and second, the measures included in the
budget for 2003 do not seem sufficient to attain the
deficit target, together with the fact that the

implementation of the wide ranging programme of
structural reforms envisaged in the latest update of the
stability programme does not seem to be sufficiently
advanced to yield significant savings already in 2003.

The Portuguese authorities have, however, made the

public commitment to take the necessary additional

measures to ensure the achievement of the deficit target
for 2003. Such measures were not yet announced. 
For 2004, the forecast for the government deficit is
based on legislation currently in force: in the absence of

new policy measures the deficit is expected to

marginally improve to slightly above 3% of GDP.

7913.Finland
Activity picking up in the face of downside risks
Economy in 2002
In 2002, Finland was one of the very few countries in
the EU to experience a pick-up in economic activity.

Boosted substantially by domestic and external demand
alike, real GDP rose by 1.6%, up from 0.6% a year
earlier. Yet, a further reduction in inventories shaved
1.8 percentage points off the rate of growth. 
Government consumption increased by 4% owing
mainly to higher municipal spending, while private
consumption rose by 2.1%, benefiting from robust

household spending on durable consumer goods. On the

other hand, total investment contracted, owing to a

slump in private investment, in particular construction,

whereas public capital spending grew by a hefty 7%.
Exports appear to have been strong as well. Export
volumes increased by an estimated 5 ½%, although

nominal values decreased by 1 ½%, suggesting a
substantial fall in export prices. Imports, due to weak
investment, rose by a  modest 1.7%.  The contribution

from stockbuilding to GDP growth was negative for the

second consecutive year. 
Although output growth has remained well below
potential of some 3% for already two years,

employment creation has proved highly resilient,
suggesting some labour hoarding by firms. Yet,
according to national accounts data, company profits

rose by about 1 ½% in 2002. Towards the end of the

year, though, firms increased dismissals in the
manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, employment is
estimated to have increased by ¼ % on average in 2002
owing to a rising number of jobs in the service sector.

As labour supply increased slightly, unemployment

hovered around the level of 2001. Consumer price
inflation decelerated by about ½ percentage point to
2.0% in 2002. The moderation followed mainly from
easing food prices, but was constrained by a rebound in
energy costs and a continued upward drift of services
prices. 
Prospects
Economic indicators for the first three months paint a
mixed picture for 2003. On the one hand, information

on consumer confidence and retail trade point to a

continued rise in private consumption and imports.
However, industry surveys and production data suggest
a rather subdued development in the manufacturing

sector implying a weaker export performance.

Therefore, activity is set to advance at a moderate pace

in the first half of 2003. Against a base-line expectation

of international uncertainty abating and external
demand reviving, a pick-up in activity is expected
towards 2004, lifting the annual rate of GDP growth to
2 ¼ % in 2003 and further to some 3% in 2004. 
Employment seems to be affected by the weak  output
growth of the past two years, since firms have started to
adjust their workforce  to lower demand in particular in
manufacturing and transport. Still, domestic demand

should hold up relatively well, generating further

opportunities for service sector employment.
Consequently, employment is projected to slightly dip
during the first quarters of 2003. In addition, the
delayed recovery and spare capacity in the corporate

sector are expected to hold back job creation. In any

case, hiring should not face major supply constraints,

given the continued decline in the NAIRU and the fact
that the level of unemployment is expected to remain
above the EU average throughout the forecast period. 
GDP components 
Private consumption is expected to continue driving the
economic recovery on the back of steady gains in
disposable income following from higher wage

increases and further income tax cuts in 2003. Apart
from higher income, spending on durables should
benefit from a reduction in car taxation and advances in
digital communication. Public spending, however, is

expected to decelerate based on the efforts at central

government expenditure control. Investment activity,

lacking the stimulus from external demand and
Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
Finland
80suffering from excess capacity, is projected to decline
further. In particular, capital spending on equipment
seems to recede while construction of business premises
suffers from rising vacancy rates. Civil engineering and
housing construction, on the other hand, should gain
from infrastructure improvements and higher housing
demand supported by advantageous financing
opportunities. Public investment should be restrained by
the consolidation efforts of local governments. 
The appreciation of the euro has diminished the price
competitiveness of Finnish firms markedly, as 67% of
goods exports go outside the euro area. Moreover,

fragile external demand is not expected to give any
significant boost to growth prior to the second half of
2003. In 2004, net exports should gain from higher
export market growth and the decline in price
competitiveness bottoming out. Prospects for exports of

telecommunication equipment, but also of forest
products appear promising. On the other hand, higher
consumer spending is expected to raise imports,

squeezing the contribution from external demand to

GDP growth. De-stocking in manufacturing should
abate during 2003. 
Costs and prices
Lower prices for imported goods are estimated to

reduce price pressures, bringing HICP inflation further
down to about 1 ¾ - 1 ½ % over the forecast period. In
December 2002, a centralised two-year wage agreement

provided for general wage rises of 2.9% in 2003 and

812.2% in 2004. Assuming the  usual positive wage drift
of about 1 percentage point, per-capita wages are

expected to increase by nearly 4% in 2003 and about

3 ½% in 2004, up from 3.3% in 2002. However, higher

growth in overall productivity appears likely to curb the

rise in unit labour costs. 
Public finances
The general government surplus came out significantly

higher in 2002 than anticipated, at 4.7% of GDP. This
was due to both higher revenue, mainly from taxes, and
lower-than-expected expenditure growth. Due to a
marked normalisation of corporate and capital tax
revenue  from 2000, the surplus is estimated to continue 
moderating. Based on the expenditure restraint implied
by the budget for 2003 and central government
spending plans for 2004, the general government

surplus seems to moderate to around 3 % of GDP by
2004. 
In 2003 and 2004, the trend of a mildly rising nominal
government debt is expected to continue. This is due to

a decline in the primary surplus and the ongoing

reduction in the holdings of domestic government

bonds by social security funds. However, as a
consequence of the expected acceleration of GDP
growth, the debt ratio is anticipated to fall gradually to

just about 41 ½ % of GDP by the end of the forecast

period.Graph 3.26 :

Broad recovery in 2004, as exports and investment gain momentum
The economy in 2002 
The Swedish economy showed resilience in 2002 and
GDP growth was 1.9%, up from 1.1% in 2001. Despite
the fact that exports remained weak, the contribution to
growth from net exports was highly positive, due to

very low imports. The prolonged global slump,

particularly in the telecom sector, has weighed heavily

on Swedish exports and on manufacturing. On the

domestic side, economic activity was mixed. Private
consumption accelerated and grew by 1.3% in 2002, up
from a mere 0.2% in 2001, aided by a very strong

increase in disposable incomes. Lower taxes and a

resilient labour market contributed to this. On the other

hand, share prices continued to fall substantially in
2002. This led households to substantially increase the
saving rate. Also, public consumption rose markedly in

2002. Investment was very poor, influenced by
uncertain business prospects. With decent GDP growth
and at the same time almost flat employment growth,

productivity growth per person rose sharply in 2002.
Inflation fell sharply in early 2002 and, as inflationary
pressures should remain subdued, the repo-rate was cut
twice towards the end of 2002.
Prospects
Recent indicators are somewhat mixed and the geo-
political uncertainty weighs on consumer and business

expectations. Consumer confidence indicators have
stabilised at a relatively low level recently. However,
consumer™s views on the prospects for their own
financial situation have fared better than their views on
the general economic situation. Business confidence

indicators are at a low level, but the latest results show

a positive shift in sentiment. Indications of a recovery

in the world economy too appear to be very uncertain
indeed in the short-term. The Swedish economy is very
open with exports about 50% of GDP. These prospects,

both domestically and externally, are expected to result
in a gradual recovery of GDP growth in 2003. Private
consumption growth should be fairly stable and a

turnaround in investment is expected during 2003.
External demand growth should pick up during 2003,

resulting in stronger exports. In 2004, economic growth
is expected to strengthen and to be close to potential.
Overall, GDP is expected to grow by 1.4% in 2003 and
2.7% in 2004.
Inflation is expected to fall below the Riksbank™s
inflation target of 2% towards the end of 2003, as the
temporary rises in electricity and energy prices subside.

Wage increases are expected to fall slightly in 2003 and
2004, as the labour market deteriorates somewhat in

2003. Upside risks to wage rises exist, with new wage
negotiations starting in autumn 2003, but are not
assessed to be very great. 
GDP components
Private consumption is expected to continue to grow
steadily in 2003. While employment should fall slightly

in 2003, the rise in household disposable income should
support sustained consumption growth. Moreover, the

saving rate of households is expected to remain broadly
stable in 2003, after having risen very sharply in 2001
and 2002, totalling close to 6 percentage points.

Consumer confidence has stabilised recently and

households™ expectations regarding their own financial

situation have improved, in contrast to expectations

regarding the general economic situation. On the
downside, the prolonged fall in equity prices, in fact
larger between the peak in 2000 and 2003 than during

the depression in 1929-32, results in negative wealth

effects. House prices, however, have continued to rise

slowly and should partially offset this. These overall

negative wealth effects are expected to subside in 2003
and further in 2004, suggesting some increase in private
consumption. Investment growth is expected to be

negative, while gradually improving, in 2003, as

business prospects are very uncertain and also due to
Chapter 3
Member States, Sweden
83negative overhang into 2003. The latest investment
survey reveals that industry does not plan any
expansion in 2003. A rise in investment is foreseen for
2004, as economic activity gathers momentum. Stocks

are expected to contribute positively to growth in 2003,
as de-stocking should be completed. As external
demand growth is expected to strengthen in 2003,
Swedish exports should pick-up further. Export of

goods turned positive in 2002 and some further growth
is expected in 2003 whereas export of services fell

markedly in 2002 and the foreseen improvement is not
sufficient to result in positive growth in 2003. In 2004,
a further recovery in exports is expected, in line with

world markets. Imports too should pickup, as final
demand recovers in 2003 and 2004. 
Costs and prices
Inflation has risen considerably since the beginning of
this year, due to strong price rises on electricity and
energy. These factors are expected to be temporary and
should subdue later this year and inflation should fall
below 2% towards the end of 2003, as inflationary
pressures are largely absent. Wage increases are

expected to be somewhat below 4% in 2003 and 2004.
New wage negotiations, foreseen to start in autumn
2003, are not expected to result in higher wage
increases, in part due to some deterioration in the labour
market in 2003. As productivity growth is expected to
be close to 2% over the forecast period, wage increases

of around 4% should be compatible with inflation close

to the Riksbank™s 2% target. Inflation is expected to fall

Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
Sweden
84below 2% in the end of 2003 and to gradually reach 2%
in the end of 2004. 
Labour market
Employment growth eased during 2002 and was
marginally positive for the year. A fall in private sector
employment was countered by a rise in public sector
employment. Some evidence suggests that there has
been an element of labour hoarding in 2002 and
employment is expected to fall somewhat in 2003. This

should result in a slight increase in the unemployment
rate this year. In 2004, some employment growth is
expected, as economic activity gains momentum. 
Public finances
Swedish public finances have been in surplus each year
since 1998 and a surplus of 1.3% of GDP was posted in
2002. The fiscal policy framework has contributed to

the strong fiscal position. In 2003, the surplus in public
finances is expected to be slightly 
lower. Lower economic growth contributes to this.
Higher tax rates levied by the local government sector
in 2003 contribute to a rise in the tax ratio this year.
Overall revenues are expected to rise broadly in line
with nominal GDP in 2004. On the expenditure side,
the government remains committed to the previously set

expenditure ceilings on central government, as

announced in the Budget Bill for 2003. However, the

budgetary margins within the expenditure ceilings are

very small and expenditure in some areas, such as sick
insurance, is likely to be higher than planned on current
policies. Overall, the expenditure ratio is expected to

rise in 2003 and to fall slightly in 2004, as economic
activity revives. 
Despite the very narrow margins in the central
government expenditure plans over the forecast period,
the use of ceilings remains a very important tool for
containing expenditure in the medium-term. This helps
keeping the public finances in good shape and budget
surpluses of close to 1% of GDP are expected over the
forecast period. Gross debt was 52.4% of GDP in 2002.

The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall over the

forecast period and to be below 50% of GDP in 2004,

as the budget surpluses described above take effect.

Gradual recovery, as investment and net exports revive
The economy in 2002 
The British economy has weathered the global
weakness rather well. Overall, growth was in 2002 was
1.8%, slightly above the Commission's Autumn
forecast. Weakness in exports and investment,

associated with the global slowdown, have been offset

by strong household consumption and a fiscal loosening

in the form of planned rises in general government

spending.
The celebrations of the Queen™s Jubilee affected  the
quarterly path of GDP within 2002. Thus, although

GDP grew by 0.4% in Q4, the Office for National
Statistics noted that the underlying rate could have been
as high as 0.6%. Growth in Q4 was again largely
sustained by household consumption and public
expenditure. 
Although household expenditure was subdued early in
2002, it picked up so that it became the biggest
contributor to GDP growth in the year. Fixed

investment, already declining in 2001, was a drag on
growth throughout the year. General government

consumption was a modest contributor to GDP growth.
Net exports of goods and services strengthened during
the first half of the year, due to a rebound in export

growth in Q2 while import growth declined, but this

was not maintained. Recorded net exports in Q4 were

especially weak. For the year as a whole, net exports

were the largest negative drag to GDP growth. 
On the output side, services output became more
subdued in Q4. Construction peaked early in 2002 and
grew well during the year, but manufacturing output
continued to fall in all quarters except Q3. The labour
market has stayed strong.  Productivity growth (in terms

of output per head) was low for 2002 as employers held
on to labour in the face of a slowdown in growth.

However, growth picked up strongly in the second half
of the year. Inflationary pressures remained low - on the
HICP measure, inflation in 2002 was 1.3%, around the

lowest in the EU. RPIX inflation has risen a little above
the 2.5% target in recent months, but it is well within
the permitted one percentage point symmetrical margin.   
Prospects 
Growth for 2003 on average is forecast to be 2.2%, with

the rate rising to 2.6%, around trend, in 2004. It is

expected that the global economic climate will revive
during the second half of 2003 and boost exports. The
contribution of the net external balance to annual
growth is expected to be less negative from 2003

onwards than in previous years. Meanwhile, domestic

demand is expected to remain strong, in part as a result
of macro-economic measures in the form of lower
interest rates and continued strong growth in public
expenditure, especially fixed investment. Household

consumption growth is expected to slow from recent,
unsustainable growth rates. With growth well below
trend (put at around 2½ to 2¾%) in 2002, a negative
output gap of around 1% of GDP has emerged, so
supply constraints, overall, should not constrain growth.

Unemployment is expected to remain close to its
NAIRU level throughout the forecast period. A small

pick-up in wage increases is expected, up from recent
rates that have been depressed by low bonus payments.
This is accompanied by a pick-up in labour productivity
growth (on a per head basis), so growth in unit labour
costs will remain subdued.  
GDP components 
Growth in household consumption is expected to be
maintained over the forecast period, albeit below the

rapid rates observed in 2001 and 2002. Real wage

earnings are expected to grow moderately and low
interest rates will support growth. The rise in house
prices, still racing along at over 20% year on year, is
offsetting the negative impact the recent falls in equity

markets may have on consumption out of wealth.
Nevertheless, the ongoing falls in financial wealth
associated with equity market weakness, combined with
the rise in gross debt associated with rapidly rising

house prices are expected to affect the savings rate,
Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003
United Kingdom
86raising it by the end of the forecast period. 2003 will
see a reversal in the current decline of fixed investment,
which will benefit from strong planned boosts to
general government investment and an end to the fall in
business investment. The latter is in line with a better
financial position of companies. Government
consumption will be an important contributor to
demand growth, as planned. This will be further
boosted by expenditure from the Ministry of Defence™s
special reserves of £3bn announced by the Chancellor
to cover the military campaign in Iraq. Export growth is

expected to recover during the forecast period. Import

growth will, on the whole, be a little weaker than export

growth. This is despite slightly higher growth in

domestic demand compared to 2002, and is due to the
lower import content of that part of domestic demand
which will accelerate the most, namely government
expenditure (current and capital).  
Labour Market 
The labour market has remained strong despite the
global slowdown, with the unemployment rate being

around twenty-seven year lows in 2002. Rises in wage
earnings continue to be moderate, and are expected to

stay that way, although compensation of employees per

head will be boosted this year as a result of the
introduction of higher employers' national insurance
contributions in April. Employment has grown

moderately, by 0.7% in 2002, but is expected to slow a

little this year. Unemployment is expected to remain

stable over the forecast period. This year, productivity

Member States, United Kingdom
87growth is expected to be higher than the low rate
observed in 2002 as a whole, given the stronger

expected GDP growth and the tight labour market. Unit

labour costs rises are expected to be moderate and

sustainable over the forecast period. 
External balance 
The current account deficit is expected to rise a little

throughout the forecast period to around 1½% of GDP
by 2004. Nevertheless, the negative contribution of net
exports of goods and services to GDP growth in 2002 is
expected to decline over the forecast period as UK
overseas markets show good growth. 
Prices 
HICP inflation was low at around 1.6 % in February -

among the lowest in the EU. Recently, UK inflation on
the RPIX measure has been slightly above the Bank of
England's 2½% target rate. Much of the upwards

pressure, year on year, has come from the oil price and

feedback from the buoyant housing market (through the
housing depreciation component of the RPIX measure).

However, there are already signs that the housing
market is slowing down, and oil prices are forecast to
fall. Benign developments in unit labour costs should

continue in the face of an economy operating a little

below potential and with unemployment close to the
NAIRU. RPIX inflation is thus expected to meet the
government™s 2 ½ % target. 
Public finances
The general government finances recorded a deficit of
1.3% of GDP in 2002. The deficit is expected to widen

further in 2003 as some tax revenues, notably
corporation tax, are weak, while discretionary
expenditure growth, especially fixed investment, is
forecast to rise strongly as planned. It is assumed that

expenditure will turn out broadly as projected by the

authorities, in nominal terms. The Commission is thus
projecting deficits of around 2½% of GDP in the
forecast years. The continuation of a significant
negative output gap of around 1% of GDP throughout

the forecast period results in a cyclically adjusted

balance of close to 2%. The ratio of gross debt to GDP
will rise to around 40% by the end of 2004. 
The forecast is based on announced policy and does not
take account of any new policy measures contained in

A halting recovery and growing deficits 
The economy in 2002
After the recession in 2001 the US economy has been
recovering at an uneven pace. It showed unexpected

strength in the winter of 2001/2002 and again in the

early summer of 2002, before it fell into what the
Federal Reserve called a "soft spot" last autumn. The
halting nature of the recovery process left the annual

increase in real GDP at 2.4%, ie below long-term

potential. Private consumption was once again the main

engine of growth, well supported by government

spending. Business fixed investment continued to
decline on an annual average basis, but in terms of
contribution to GDP growth the negative impact was

completely offset by the upturn in the business

inventory cycle. The major drag on GDP growth came
from a further decline in net exports: while imports
surged back to the peaks from before the recession,
exports were recovering much more slowly and still
registered a fall on an annual average basis.
With growth being below-par there was no net
employment gain and the unemployment rate fluctuated
between 5.6% and 6%. Inflation was subdued with

'core' inflation declining to just below 2% by the end of
the year. The trade deficit rose to new record heights,

pushing the current account deficit to 5.2% of GDP in
the final quarter. The dollar's trade-weighted exchange
value reached a peak in February 2002, but has been

trending downwards since then. Equity prices fell even

more than in the preceding two years, but the negative

wealth effect was counterbalanced by continuing price
gains in the housing market.
The halting recovery was supported by highly
stimulative macro-economic policies. The Federal
Reserve, after having lowered the federal funds rate to

1.75% in 2001, reduced it further to 1.25% in

November, resulting in real short-term rates close to
zero. On the fiscal side, the strongest impact came from
the tax cuts adopted in 2001, the stimulus package from
March 2002, and higher defence spending. These
measures alone injected a fiscal stimulus corresponding
to 1.5% of GDP. Overall, the balance of general
government finances declined to -3.3% of GDP.
Prospects clouded by geopolitical uncertainties
The lack of growth momentum in the US economy
which became evident last autumn has continued in the
early months of 2003. Economic indicators have shown

a weakening of demand, consumer confidence has

fallen to a ten-year low, payroll employment has started

to decline again and industrial production is virtually

stagnant.
Many attribute the "soft spot" in the recovery to
heightened geopolitical risks relating mainly to the Iraq-

crisis. Business and consumer confidence are indeed
likely to strengthen when the perception of such risks
should fall again. But apart from this, the future path of

the US economy depends on how a number of

underlying forces and processes will play out. On the

positive side, there is not only the accommodative
stance of monetary policy and an expansionary fiscal
policy, but also an underlying trend of strong
productivity growth. The average annual increase in
output per hour has been about 2½ % in the non-farm

business sector in the past seven years. Following the
latest recession, productivity growth even surged to an
annual average of 4.8% in 2002. A considerable
slowdown is likely in the second and third years of the
recovery in line with the profile of past business cycles.
Evidence of this can already be seen in the sharp
deceleration in productivity growth in the final quarter
of last year. But the higher level of the underlying trend

growth rate for productivity seems to remain intact. 
However, there are also a number of constraining
factors. Firstly, growth in personal consumption
expenditure will be limited by balance sheet
adjustments in the household sector. This will be a
reaction to: (a) the negative wealth effect from the

decline in equity prices over the past three years which

has not yet played out fully; (b) the still relatively high

levels of household indebtedness and debt-service

burden; (c) the inevitable slowing in mortgage

United States
92refinancing activity with associated cash-out payments
which was an important support for consumer spending
in 2002. Secondly, the upturn in business fixed

investment is being held back by a considerable degree

of unused capacity in the manufacturing sector and in

non-residential structures. Finally, the international

competitiveness of US goods and services continues to
be weak: the dollar's depreciation in trade-weighted
terms over the past year is still rather trivial compared
to the appreciation in the 1995-2001 period.
The recovery is likely to continue at a subdued pace
Taking both the positive and the negative conditions
into account, the forecast expects the recovery to
proceed at a somewhat restrained pace. Consumer

spending is expected to be weak in the first half of
2003, but the additional public spending in connection
with the war in Iraq should more than offset the effect
on growth, particularly in the second quarter. Assuming

that the military expenditure and the related costs will
be limited to the $75 billion requested by the

Administration and that it will be largely spent before
the end of the year, it is projected that the fiscal
stimulus will peter out in the second half of the year.
2This should lower GDP growth towards the end of the
                                                          
2This forecast does not factor in the possible adoption
and implementation of the Administration's proposal of
7 January 2003 to cut taxes, including the taxation of

dividend income, at a budgetary costs of about $670

billion over ten years.

93year in spite of an expected pick-up in private
consumption and business investment from the summer
onwards. In the course of 2004 GDP growth should
gradually become more robust. Such a development

would result in annual growth rates of 2.4% for 2003

and 2.5% for 2004. Unemployment would increase
slightly to about 6% while inflation would remain
below 2%. The fiscal deficit of general government
would reach 4.8% of GDP this year and 4.6% next year.
The current account deficit would continue to rise and
exceed 6% of GDP next year.
The development in private consumption expenditure
will be the key determinant for the strength of the
recovery going forward. Consumer spending is

expected to grow by just under 2% in 2003 which
would allow an improvement in household balance

sheets. Subsequently, a gradual pick-up in consumer
spending to just above 3% in 2004 is expected.
Business investment in equipment and software should

continue its slow recovery as excess capacity is
gradually absorbed, but remain far below the double-

digit growth rates of the late 1990s. Last year's sizeable

contribution to growth from the inventory turnaround
will diminish over the forecast period. Investment in
non-residential structures is likely to remain weak for
anotheryear. Residential investment stayedon a high
level during the recession and has therefore little
potential to strengthen the recovery Œ it is indeed
expected to remain flat in 2004 in  conjunction  with
firming  interest  rates.     Growth   in government
consumption expenditure is projected to fall back next
year after this year's surge due to the Iraq war. Finally,

the continuing decline in net exports will subtract about

two thirds of a percentage point from annual GDP
growth within the forecast period.While this is
considered the most likely scenario, there are both
downside and upside risks to such an outcome. A
serious retrenchment in household demand, for instance

in the context of a discontinuation of house price rises,
may be the biggest negative risk. The projected
development of consumer spending in the forecast

period implies a modest rise in the household saving

rate from 4% to 4.9% this year, but then a renewed
decline to 4.2% next year. If households should want to
move towards their 7-8% long-term average saving
rate, the economy would fall into another recession. On
the upside, it cannot be ruled out that the considerable

impetus put in place by monetary and fiscal policy

could lead to somewhat stronger demand growth.
Furthermore, there is the possibility that additional tax
cuts, as proposed by the Administration in January

2003, will be adopted.

Moderate growth outlook with downside risks
Current situation 
National account data suggest that the Japanese
economy continued to expand in the fourth quarter of

2002 by a quarterly (non-annualised) growth rate of

0.5%. Overall, real GDP followed a fairly strong

quarterly growth path in 2002, with private
consumption and net exports being the two main factors
supporting the expansion. Nevertheless, due to a large

negative carry-over from 2001, a
nnual growth in 
2002stood at only 0.3%.
Japanese national account data need to be interpreted
with caution, however, as they are frequently up for

significant revisions. The all-industries activity index,

one of the best output based measures of economic

activity, shows a more moderate quarterly growth path

in 2002 and a quarter-on-quarter fall of 1.0% in the last
quarter. Also, the household survey, which serves as the
basis to more than half of the private consumption

component, registered a strong fall in the fourth quarter.
Accordingly, a future downward revision of GDP

growth in the fourth quarter should not be excluded.
Prospects
The growth outlook for the Japanese economy remains
bleak, but an imminent recession appears rather
unlikely, partly as inventories have come down to very
low levels. Indicators for the first two months of the

year, including industrial production and machinery

orders, seem to indicate a moderate output expansion in

the first quarter of this year.
The strong growth in private consumption which took
place in the first three quarters of last year, despite flat

real take-home pay, a continued fall in housing prices
and an uncertain labour market, is unlikely to continue.
In addition, consumer confidence has declined
somewhat on the back of the current geopolitical

uncertainties. A longer period of high oil prices would
take its toll on private consumption, which constitutes
more than half of Japanese GDP. 
Due to the supplementary budget for FY 2002,
government consumption should continue to support

growth in the current year. Profits in the manufacturing

sector regained some strength last year, which normally
should encourage stronger private investment.
Nevertheless, as the corporate sector as a whole

continues to be faced with excessive capacity and the

need to reduce its debt, it is uncertain to what extent

these higher profits will translate into stronger private

capital expenditure. 
Despite a delayed global recovery, export growth is still
forecast to be robust. In particular the rest of Asia,

which is the largest export destination for Japanese

goods, is expected to continue to perform well. In 2004,
export growth is expected to be somewhat dented by
lagged effects of the effective appreciation of the yen.
Import growth is also projected to recover, in tandem
with domestic demand. Overall, net exports are forecast
to give a positive contribution to growth, although
declining over the period. 
Real GDP is projected to grow at some 1.5% in the
current year, facilitated by a sizeable overhang, and to

slow down slightly to around 1.3% in 2004, helped by

the leap-year. 
Labour market and wages
The situation in the labour market remains difficult and
unemployment has continued to linger around

historically high levels. Employment fell in the first half
of last year, mainly due to a scaling down of labour in
the manufacturing and wholesale/retail sales sectors,
and remained roughly flat during the second half of the
year. However, new job offers have risen since the

beginning of the year, pointing to a possible

improvement in the near term. 
Chapter 4
Non EU countries, Japan
95Nominal wages seem to be fairly flexible in Japan, with
the bonus system facilitating downward adjustments in
the overall compensation to employees. Compensation
of employees per head fell by 1.5% in 2002 and is also
expected to fall somewhat in the current year, keeping
real compensation per employee basically unchanged. 
Deflation and monetary policy
The Japanese economy continues to struggle with
deflation. Prices are currently falling on its 5
th (as
measured by the consumer price index) to 9
th year (as
measured by the GDP deflator). The year-on-year
change in core CPI (excluding energy and fresh food)

remained fairly stable at around Œ0.9% up to last

Autumn, but the decline recently eased slightly to
-0.6% in December and remained at this level in
January.
Deflationary expectations now seem entrenched. With
nominal short-term interest rates at the zero floor,

persistent deflation has contributed to bringing the
economy into a liquidity trap, which together with the
vast amount of non-performing loans in the banking

sector impair the transmission mechanisms of monetary

policy. In a recent speech to a Parliamentary committee,
the new Bank of Japan Governor, Mr Fukui, who took
up office in the middle of March, indicated that he
might conduct a somewhat more expansionary
monetary policy than his predecessor.

Economic Forecasts, Spring 2003 
Japan96General government finances
Public finances remain in a poor state and the absence
of any medium-term consolidation strategy is striking.
In 2002, the general government deficit is estimated to
have amounted to close to 7% of GDP and the

consolidated gross debt to have exceeded 140% of

GDP. With the supplementary budget for FY 2002 and

the tax cuts included in the budget for FY 2003, the

fiscal stance is likely to be slightly expansionary in the
current year. 
Risks to the forecast
There are sizeable risks to the forecast, with a bias to

the downside. The two main downside risks are linked
to geo-politicaldevelopmentsandthefinancial sector.
Firstly,  a  prolonged  intervention  in Iraq, with  a  long 
period of sustained high oil prices, would take its toll on
the Japanese economy. Secondly, the financial sector is
still in a very fragile state and concerns that some of the

major banks would turn out to be undercapitalised at the

closing of the financial year (end of March) have again
been mounting. However, the newly established
financial framework incorporates specific measures to
limit the impact of such a risk. 
On the upside, if the downside risks do not to
materialise and if the current national account data are
not revised downwards, growth in 2003 could turn out
stronger than projected in the forecast. Corporate profits
in the manufacturing sector could, as seems to have

been the case in the second half of 2002, continue to
support an expansion of private capital expenditure.
