  2 Update on economic and monetary 
developments
 Summary
 The resurgence in coronavirus (COVID
-19) 
infections presents renewed challenges to 
public health and the growth prospects of the euro area and global economies. 
Incoming information signals that the euro area economic recovery is losing 
momentum more rapidly than expected, after a strong, yet par
tial and uneven, 
rebound in economic activity over the summer months. The rise in COVID
-19 cases 
and the associated intensification of containment measures is weighing on activity, 
constituting a clear deterioration
 in the near
-term outlook.
 Incoming data 
for the global economy 
point to a fast rebound of global activity in the 
third quarter, but also to 
slowing 
momentum. After a sharp contraction in the first half 
of 2020, the global composite 
output
 Purchasing Managers™ Index 
(excluding the euro 
area) and 
high
-frequency 
indicators 
rebounded considerably in the third quarter, 
albeit
 stabilis
ing
 in September. In addition to weak labour market prospects, uncertainty 
is weigh
ing
 on consumer behaviour. Global trade also recover
ed sharply in the third 
quarter, fo
llowing the sharp and deep contraction in the second quarter. Global 
inflation remained low.
 Over the review period
, the forward curve of the euro overnight index average (EONIA) 
shifted slightly downwards and remain
ed mildly inverted. Despite the inversio
n, the 
curve does not suggest firm market expectations of an imminent rate cut. Long
-term 
sovereign bond spreads declined steadily across 
euro area 
countries
, amid 
expectations of further monetary policy and fiscal support. 
Equity price indices 
significant
ly declined, amid sizeable intra
-period movement
. In foreign exchange 
markets, the euro remained broadly stable in trade
-weighted terms.
 The latest
 data point to a strong rebound in output 
in the euro area
 in the third quarter
 of 2020
, following the sharp 
contraction of 11.8%, quarter on quarter, in the second 
quarter. However, the ongoing increases in coronavirus infection rates constitute a 
headwind to the short
-term outlook and will, in all likelihood, lead to a significant 
softening in output growth in 
the final quarter of the year, as already indicated by 
recent surveys. At the same time, the recovery continues to be uneven across sectors, 
with the services sector being 
the 
hardest hit by the pandemic, in part as a result of its 
sensitivity to social di
stancing measures. Looking further ahead, a sustained recovery 
remains highly dependent on the course the pandemic takes and the success of the 
containment policies. While the uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic 
will likely dampen the stre
ngth of the recovery in the labour market and in consumption 
and investment, the euro area economy should continue to be supported by 
favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a gradual 
strengthening 
of global activity and demand.

 Summary
  3 Euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 
-0.3% in September
, from 
-0.2% in 
August, reflecting 
developments in the prices of
 energy, non
-energy industrial goods 
and services. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account 
the temporary reduction in German VAT, headline inflation is likely to remain negative 
until
 early 2021. Moreover, near
-term price
 pressures will remain subdued owing to 
weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel
-related sectors, as well as to lower 
wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Over the medium 
term, a recovery in demand supported by accommodative
 monetary and fiscal policies 
will put upward pressure on inflation. Market
-based indicators 
and survey
-based 
measures
 of longer
-term inflation expectations
 remain broadly unchanged at low 
levels
. The coronavirus pandemic has continued to influence 
signifi
cantly 
money and credit 
dynamics in the euro area. Money growth increased further in September 2020 and 
domestic credit, which continued to be the main source of money creation, was 
increasingly supported by the Eurosystem™s net purchases of government bon
ds. The 
timely and sizeable measures taken by monetary, fiscal and supervisory authorities 
since the outbreak of the pandemic have continued to underpin the extension of bank 
credit on favourable terms to the euro area economy. However, as evidenced by the
 October 2020 euro area bank lending survey, banks tightened their credit standards 
on loans to firms and households in the third quarter of 2020 on account of heightened 
risk perceptions.
 The monetary policy measures that 
the Governing Council has
 taken s
ince early 
March are helping to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors and 
jurisdictions across the euro area, thereby providing crucial support to underpin 
economic activity and to safeguard medium
-term price stability. At the same time,
 in 
the current environment of risks clearly tilted to the downside, the Governing Council 
will carefully assess the incoming information, including the dynamics of the pandemic, 
prospects for a rollout of vaccines and developments in the exchange rate. Th
e new 
round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in December will allow a 
thorough reassessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks. On the basis 
of this updated assessment, the Governing Council will recalibrate its instruments, as 
appropriate, to respond to the unfolding situation and to ensure that financing 
conditions remain favourable to support the economic recovery and counteract the 
negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path. This will foster the 
convergenc
e of inflation towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its 
commitment to symmetry.
 In the meantime, 
the Governing Council
 decided to reconfirm 
its
 accommodative 
monetary policy stance.
 The Governing Council
 will keep the key ECB interest rates 
unchanged. 
They are 
expected 
to remain at their present or lower levels until the inflation outlook robustly 
converge
s to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2
% within 
the
 projection horizon, 
and such convergence has been consistently reflected in un
derlying inflation 
dynamics.

 Summary
  4 The Governing Council
 will continue 
its
 purchases under the pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of •1,350 billion. These purchases 
contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the 
downward impact of the pandemic on the project
ed path of inflation. The purchases 
will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and 
among jurisdictions. This allows 
the Governing Council
 to effectively stave off risks to 
the smooth transmission of monetary policy. 
The Governing Council
 will conduct net 
asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2
021 and, in any case, 
until 
it 
judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. 
The Governing Council
 will 
reinvest the principal payments from maturing 
securities purchased under the PEPP 
until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll
-off of the PEPP portfolio will 
be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
 Net purchases under 
the 
asset purchase programme (
APP) will continue at a monthly 
pace of •20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional •120 billion 
temporary envelope until the end of the year. 
The Governing Council
 continue
s to 
expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for 
as long as necessary to 
reinfo
rce the accommodative impact of
 policy rates, and to end shortly before 
the 
Governing Council
 start
s raising the key ECB interest rates. 
The Governing Council
 intend
s to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments fr
om maturing securities 
purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when 
it start
s raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to 
maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monet
ary 
accommodation.
 The Governing Council
 will also continue to provide ample liquidity through 
its
 refinancing operations. In particular, 
the
 third series of targeted longer
-term 
refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source of funding for banks, 
supporting bank lending to firms and households.

  5 1 External environment
 Incoming data point to
 a fast rebound 
of global activity in 
the third quarter, but 
also to 
momentum slowing down afterwards
. After a sharp contraction in the first 
half 
of 
2020, the global composite 
output PMI (excluding
 the 
euro area
) rebounded 
considerably 
during
 the third quarter, to 51.8 
compared to 
37.9 in the
 previous quarter
. However, it remained unchanged in September, as the
 marginal improvement in 
services 
was offset by
 a slight drop in the manufacturing output PMI
 (Chart 1)
. 
Overall, 
services which are 
characterised by high physical proximity, such as tou
rism and 
recreation, transportation and consumer services, remained weak in the third quarter. 
Certain non
-standard h
igh
-frequency
 indicators, such as mobility trends and 
consumer sentiment
, 
also point to a softening of momentum 
at the end of
 the third 
quarter,
 in particular in a
dvanced economies
. This
 could be a sign 
that firms and 
households 
are continuing to exercise caution in their spending decisions 
amid 
concerns 
surrounding 
resurging infections, social distancing
 requirements and fears 
of 
the re
-intr
oduction of containment measures in the context of the ongoing 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic

 Notes: 
The latest observations are for September 20

 In addition to 
weak labour market prospects, uncertainty 
is 
weigh
ing
 on 
consumer behaviour
. The recovery of output and, to a lesser extent, of employment 
remains incomplete, particularly as regards those 
acti
vities most affected by the 
pandemic. 
Overall 
retail sales have been rising sharply 
Œ supported by pent
-up demand following lockdowns 
Œ buffered by 
disposable income
, which 
has been 
supported by government measures
. However, p
artly due to 
precautionary mot
ive, 
due to the 
heightened economic uncertainty, 
savings rates also 
remain significantly 
higher than before the pandemic. Consumer 
confidence 
is still 
very low globally, with 
little improvement seen since 
the trough in April.
 Global trade 
has also seen a s
harp recovery in the third quarter.

 on a month

according to CPB data. 
Despite being

June
 and July
, 
this increase 
provides confirmation of 
a strong recovery of world trade into the third quarter. 
The
 rebound 
is also confirmed by a
 tracker base
d on weekly 
indicators of trade
. Compared 
to previous downturns, world trade has been relatively resilient considering the sharp 
and deep economic contraction in the second quarter. This partly reflects the fact that 
the less trade
-intense services sector has borne th
e br
unt of the collapse in activity.

 Global inflation 
remained stable in August
. Annual consumer price inflation in 
Member 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co

(OECD) 
remained unchanged at 1.2% 
in August
. The downward pressure from annual 
energy price inflation continued in Au
gust, albeit
 at a decelerating pace
, 
while 
food 
price inflation 
increased marginally
. 
Annual OECD CPI inflation excluding food and 
energy decreased slightly to 1.6%. 
Inflationary pressures remain muted across major 
advanced and emerging market economies an
d are expected to remain subdued in 
the short and medium term as a result of low demand
. Oil prices have increased 
slightly
 since the last Governing Council meeting, but 
remained range
 bound due to counteracting demand and supply dynamics
. Since June, Bren
t oil prices have fluctuated between 
USD 
35 and 45 per barrel and 
are currently around 7% higher 
than the values reported in 
the September Governing 
Council meeting. 
After the increase in 
global oil demand in July as coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) 
restrictions eas
ed, the International Energy Agency expects oil demand 
to decelerate amid an increase of COVID
-19 cases 
worldwide
. Lower oil supply 
continues to counteract downward pressures from demand, with oil supply falling in 
September as OPEC+ countries improved the
 compliance rate with their production 
agreement. This adds to the substantial oil supply cuts following the OPEC+ 
agreement in response to the pandemic and the significant shut
-ins of oil production in

momentum. 
Industrial 
production 
declined in September, following a marked slowdown 
in A
ugust, while retail 
sales recovered somewhat in September (in real terms) after two sets of weak results 
in previous months. This was in line with developments in terms of p
ersonal
 income
, 
which recovered somewhat in September, while the rate of households™ savings 
remained at historically high levels
. 
However, the outlook for spending is weak in the 
absence of 
further support measures
. At the same time, 
the recovery in the US labou
r market is slowing. The marginal 
drop
 in 
unemployment 
to 7.9% 
seen in 
September 
was mainly 
due to a 
fall in the labour for
ce participation
, 
while 
the number of job 
postings stays low
. Japan is seeing a 
gradual 
economic 
recovery as the resurgence in C
OVID
-19 infections seen over the summer appears contained.
 Economic activity bottomed
 out and started to gradually resume 
since 
the end of the partial lockdown in May
. Industrial production and real exports of goods have trended 
upwards since then
, 
whilst
 impor
ts have 
fallen
 for a fourth consecutive month in August. 
Although 
resurging domestic C
OVID
-19 cases and 
poor 
weather conditions temporarily eased 
the 
recovery 
pace 
early in the summer,
 since late July
 the containment of the 
pandemic 
has been
 associated with 
increased 
consumer sentiment
 support
ing the 
recovery.
 In the United Kingdom, 
the rebound in activity shows signs of slowing by the 
end of the third quarter
. Real UK GDP shrank
 in the first half of 2020
 by around 22% 
compared to 
the level s
een at the end of 2019
. Monthly GDP 
data available until 
August
 show
ed that 
economic activity 
has been on a consistent recovery path since i
ts 
trough in April
, 
despite recent signs of a loss in momentum.
 PMIs 
also suggest 
a loss 
of momentum since August
, e
ven before the re
-introduction 
of 
additional
 containment 
measur
es,
 which have been increasing 
considerably 
since the second half of 
September
. In addition to the
 resurgence in 
the rate
 of COVID
-19 infections and 
hospitalisations, 
the 
large
 rises in unemplo
yment and
 heightened uncertainty related 
to the outcome of ongoing Brexit negotiations
 are weighing on the recovery.
 In China, 
real 
GDP growth 
during the third quarter confirmed the continuation 
and broadening of the recovery
. Although GDP growth was sligh
tly below

us forecasts
, China™s economic recovery has 
continued consistently during 
the third quarter
 (4.9% year

he recovery has 
also 
been broadening. Capital

and net trade continued to support 
growth

while final consumption 
contributed positively to growth for t

  10 Euro area sovereign bond spreads 
relative to
 risk
-free rates have continued to 
decline across jurisdictions amid expectation
s of further m
onetary and fiscal 
support.
 The resurgence of 
the coronavirus (
COVID
-19) and the
 reintroduction of 
local lockdown measures across Europe ha
ve so far had only a limited impact on 
sovereign bond markets. 
Ten
-year sovereign bond spreads (
relative to
 the 
corre
sponding risk
-free rate) currently stand close to their pre
-pandemic levels in all 
euro area countries. 
Declines in s
pread
s were most pronounced in those countries 
which had been most severely affected by the pandemic during the spring of 2020 and 
which ha
d recorded 
larger
 increases in 
spread
s. The ten
-year German, French, 
Italian, Spanish and Portuguese sovereign spreads decreased by 
10, 
9, 2
5, 9 and 1
4 basis points to reach 
-0.2
8, 0.03, 1.12, 0.5
3 and 0.52 percentage points respectively. 
Consequently, the
 GDP
-weighted euro area ten
-year sovereign spread decreased by 
11 basis points to 0.1
8 percentage points
, amid expectations of further monetary and 
fiscal support
. Equity price indices 
significantly declined
, 
following
 sizeable
 intra
-period 
movements.
 Towa
rds the end of September equity prices of euro area non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs) fell by 3.1%. After recovering fully, they declined again and 
currently stand 6% below the levels observed at the beginning of the review period
. 
Bank
 equity prices in th
e euro area decreased 
in a more pronounced manner, falling 
by 15.8% over the review period. A similar
 dynamic 
could be seen
 in the U
nited 
States
, where NFC and bank equity 
prices 
stand 
0.5%
 and 4.2% respectively below
 the 
levels 
observed at the 
beginning o
f the review period
. E
quity prices
 of euro area NFCs
 benefited from 
an improvement in short
-term earnings expectations from the very low 
levels 
seen 
earlier this year, 
while 
the equity risk premium
 increased
. 
The more recent 
sell
-off has taken place amid a
 reintroduction in some European countries of 
containment measures to limit the spread of COVID
-19. The decline in euro area bank 
equity prices is likely related to the perceived build
-up of balance sheet risk resulting 
from the renewed lockdowns.
 Euro are

 The 
spreads on both investment
-grade NFC bonds and financial sector bonds relative to 
the risk
-free rate declined slightly over the review period to stand at 9
3 and 7
6 basis 
points respecti
vely as of 2
8 October. Overall, the slight decrease reflects a decline in 
the excess bond premium
. C
redit fundamentals (as measured by ratings and 
expected default frequencies) remained largely unchanged.
 In foreign exchange markets, the euro remained broa
dly stable in 
trade
-weighted terms (see Chart 4), with some bilateral exchange rates moving 
in opposite directions, reflecting differences in the outlook 
for
 the recovery 
from the COVID

. Over the review period, the nominal effective exchange 
rate
 of the euro, as measured against the currencies of 42 of the euro area™s most

developments, the euro depreciated against the Chinese renminbi (by 2.

 Following the unprecedented fa
ll in euro area output in the second quarter of 
2020, economic 
growth
 is 
set to rebound 
in the third quarter
, before falling 
again in the fourth quarter.
 Total economic activity contracted by 11.8%, quarter on 
quarter, in the second quarter of 2020 
Œ following a decline of 3.7% in the first quarter 
Œ resulting in
 an accumulated decline of 15.1%
 in the first half of the year
 (see Chart 
5). The second quarter
 breakdown shows that the fall in GDP was broad based
, with 
declines in 
domestic demand (which made a 
-10.9 percentage point contribution to 
growth)
 and net trade (
-0.8 percentage points), as well as
 in changes in inventories 
(-0.1 percentage points). Econ
omic indicators suggest that the decline in economic 
activity owing to the 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) pandemic reached a trough in April 
2020. Hard data, survey results and high
-frequency indicators point to a vigorous 
bounceback in output in the third quarter
, while growth is expected to 
soften again 
in 
the final quarter of the year. At the same time, the recovery
 in the euro area
 is expected to be uneven across sectors, with the services 
sector
 being hardest 
hit by 
the pandemic
, in part
 as a result of
 its sen
sitivity to the social distancing measures. 
The same holds true across countries, 
with the 
recovery
 being
 dependent on the 
infection 
rates 
and efforts 
to contain 
the pandemic
. 
The COVID
-19 pandemic and 
the 
related containment measures have affected, and wi
ll continue to affect
 potential 
output. This 
is 
further 
explored 
in the article entitled ﬁ
The impact of COVID
-19 on 
potential output in
 the euro area

  13 the 
official 
unemployment rate 
was
 relatively
 limited
, rising to 8.1% in August from the 
historical low of 7.2% reached in March 2020, but still far from the peak
 of 12.7% 
recorded in February 2013
. Employment support measures
, such as short
-time work 
schemes 
and temporary layoffs
, as well as a reduction in the participation rate, help to
 explain the 
limited
 impact on
 the unemployment rate.
 Employment support measu
res 
also contained the fall in employment, which 
declined by 
2.9
% in the 
second
 quarter of 
2020 relative to the f
irst
 quarter (see Chart 6).
 Total h
ours worked declined 
substantially more
, 
decreasing 
by

% in the second quarter and
 leading
 to a fall of 
10.8
% in average hours worked per person employed.
 No information on employment 
and hours worked is yet available for the third quarter of 2020.
 Short
-term labour market indicators have partially recovered
 but continue to 
signal contractionary developments
. The Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) for 
employment 
increased
 to 48.1 in October according to its flash release,
 compared 
with
 47.7 in September and 
46.8 in August
, 
following a stronger
 rebound in July of 3.3 
points (see Chart 6)
. However,
 the current le
vel

s to suggest a 
contraction
 in employment
 and 
could be read as an early indication 
of 
subdued 
employment prospects
 in the period ahead

  14 situation is deteriorating. 
As a result
, their intentions to make 
major purchases
 remain 
at 
their
 lowest level since the 
sovereign 
debt 
crisis
. The 
recovery
 in demand for goods remains uneven.
 Total retail trade 
has 
fully 
recovered from it
s earlier 
collapse
 following the outbreak of the pandemic in Europe, 
but this
 conceals a 
highly heterogeneous
 recovery
 across sub
-categories. The 
retail 
sale of 
automotive 
fuel remain
ed below its pre
-COVID
-19 level
 in July and August
, as 
people continue to
 travel less. Likewise, 
households
 are 
purchas
ing
 less clothing and 
footwear 
owing
 to social distancing measures. 
In contrast
, purchases of audio and 
video equipment are higher than before 
the pandemic
. 
As infection rates 
have 
started 
to rise again 
recently, precautionary sav
ing is expected to remain high. Consequently, 
the saving rate is expected to 
have declined in the third quarter, but to 
remain
 well 
above pre
-COVID
-19 levels
. Following the 
20.8% 
drop in 
the second quarter
, euro area business inv
estment 
is likely to have rebounded in 
the third quarter
 in terms of growth rates, but the 
level of investment remains far below the pre
-COVID
-19 level
. Industrial 
production of capital goods stood, on average in July and August, some 23% above its 
level i
n the second quarter. G
iven the typical
ly close 
relation
ship
 with investment in 
machinery and equipment, a sharp rise in business investment 
is also expected in the 
third quarter
. 
However, i
n the coming quarters
, in addition to
 the uncertainty 
associated w
ith the development of the pandemic, 
there is a risk that the recovery in 
investment will slow significantly
. 
First, firms™ balance sheets have deteriorated. In 
crisis periods, many companies with low revenues and profits traditional
ly postpone or 
cancel a
ll non
-essential business spending, which 
includes 
capital investment. 
Second, firms™ capacity utilisation recovered 
in the 
third quarter of 2020
 to 
stand at 
72%, 
but 
remains 11% below 
the level recorded in 
the period prior to the C
OVID
-19 outbreak
. Third,
 firms™ 
order books remain 
at 
very low
 levels.
 After the 12.4% contraction in the second quarter, the strong rebound in 
housing investment expected for the third quarter should give way to a 
moderation in the pace of the recovery
. In the first half of 2020 euro area housing 
investment dropped by 14.4% relative to the end of 2019, albeit with markedly different 
developments across the largest euro area countries 
Œ ranging from a rise of 0.8% in 
Germany to a decline of 31.5% in Spain
. In fact, the outbreak of the COVID
-19 pandemic induced a widespread 
shutdown of construction
 sites and limited the 
issuance of building permits. Nevertheless, this was partly alleviated by the large 
backlog of construction plans (especially in Germany an
d the Netherlands) and was 
accompanied by a reduction in transaction volumes with no visible effects on house 
prices up to the second quarter. As several countries started loosening containment 
measures from May to September, construction activity resumed
 in the third quarter, 
benefiting also from a broad
-based decline in limits to production for companies, 
signalling similar dynamics in housing investment. Nevertheless, the euro area PMIs 
for construction output and business expectations were below the exp
ansionary 
threshold in September, signalling subdued activity over the short term. This 
moderation in the construction sector may also be related to the recent increase in 
restrictions across jurisdictions aimed at containing a new rise in infections. Furt
her 
downside risks to the medium
-term outlook for housing investment may stem
 from the

th
e demand side
. After collaps
ing
 in the second quarter, euro area trade rebound
ed strongly in 
the third quarter of 2020.
 Data on nominal trade in goods for 
July 
and August 
display 
a continuation of the 
recovery
 that started in May alongside the easing of 
COVID
-19-related restrictions
. In August euro area nominal exports and imports of 
goods rose by 4
.0
% and 2.7%
, month on month
, 
respectively. However, these figures 
still reflect a slowdown compared with 
July. The fourth consecutive month of 
expansion brought
 extra
-euro area trade 
to 
11.0
% below 
its
 February 
level in August
. Since July extra
-euro area exports have risen across all destinations 
except Asia. 
Export volumes in some categories (
namely c
hemicals and 
animal and vegetable oil), 
which had increased st
rongly during the onset of the pandemic in March and April, 
faltered from May to July. At the same time, exports 
of 
cars and fuel improved most 
strongly among 
the 
consumption sub
-categories. The first 
two 
month
s of 
the third 
quarter of 2020 point
 to a mark
ed rebound 
of manufacturing trade 
in quarterly terms.
 Leading indicators signal further improvement in the months ahead
. 
The flash 
PMI
 for
 euro area 
manufacturing new export orders 
increased to 56.0 in October, after a 
strong performance in September
. 
Firms™ 
assessment
s of 
their 
export order book 
levels
, according to the 
European Commission
™s business surveys, confirm improving 
conditions for manufacturing trade.
 This view is also supported by shipping indicators. 
However, euro area exports of services 
are undergoing a contraction that is not 
foreseen to end in the coming months
. 
After a recovery following the easing of mobility 
restrictions, the PMI for euro area services new export 
orders 
worsened in August and 
was, in October, still in clear contracti
onary territory, at 39.6
. While 
economic 
indicators
, particularly survey results, 
clearly point to a strong 
rebound in growth in the third quarter, they have recently lost some momentum, 
pointing to a significant slowdown in the final quarter of the year.
 Both the 
European Commission™s Economic Sentiment Indicator and the composite output PMI 
rose between the second and third quarter
s of 2020, in line with a strong rebound in 
growth. This pick
-up in economic activity is also confirmed by high
-frequency 
indi
cators such as electricity consumption. However, the PMI decreased in September 
and October (
falling 
to 49.4 compared 
with
 its recent peak of 54.9 in July)
, indicating a 
slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter of this year. It is clear that services have 
been more adversely affected by the pandemic than industry. This largely reflects 
the
 higher 
sensitivity 
of services 
to social distancing measures and 
the
 relatively 
sharper
 fall 
in 
growth in the services sector 
following the onset of the pandemic and the 
associated 
containment measures.
 Looking further ahead, a sustained recovery remains highly dependent on the 
course
 the pandemic 
takes 
and the success of 
the 
containment policies
. While 
the uncertainty surrounding COVID
-19 is likely to dampen the strength 
of the recovery 
in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the euro area economy 
should continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions
 and an expansionary fiscal stance
. The results of the latest round of the 
ECB Survey of

 Measures of underlying inflation declined.
 HICP inflation excluding energy and 
food (HICPX) dropped from 0.4%
 in August to 0.2% in September, a new historical 
low. This reflects a decline in services inflation from 0.7% in August to 0.5% in 
September, with subdued services inflation in recent months mainly attributable to 
falling prices related to tourism and tra
vel. It also reflects a decline in inflation for 
non-energy industrial goods from 
-0.1% in August to 
-0.3% in September, with part of 
this weakness 
probably
 reflect
ing
 the fact 
that i
n some euro area countries the 
seasonal sales of clothing and footwear we
re extended to non
-summer items
. Recent 
low readings in HICPX inflation also reflect the temporary reduction in German VAT 
rates since July 2020. Stripping out travel
-related items and clothing from HICPX 
gives
 an inflation rate of 0.8% in September
, compa
red with 0.9% in August and 1.0% in 
July, which suggests that there could be a more broad
-based weakness in underlying 
inflation owing to subdued demand. This is also signalled by the Supercore indicator, 
which is made up of cyclically sensitive HICP items
 and declined to 0.7% in September 
from 0.8% in August, also marking a historical low.

 Notes: The latest observations are for September 2020. Th
e range of measures of underlying inflation consists of the following: HICP 
excluding energy; HICP excluding energy and unprocessed food; HICP excluding energy and food; HICP excluding energy, food, 
travel
-related items and clothing; the 10% trimmed mean o
f the HICP; the 30% trimmed mean of the HICP; and the weighted median of 
the HICP. PCCI stands for the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation indicator. Growth rates for the HICP excluding ene
rgy and 
food for 2015 are distorted upwards owing to a met
hodological change (see the box entitled ﬁ
A new method for the package holiday price 
index in Germany and its impact on HICP inflation 
rates
ﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue 2, ECB, 2019).
 Pipeline price pressures for HICP non
-energy industrial goods provide mixed 
signals.
 Inflation for imported non
-food consumer goods fell to 
-1.3% in August, down 
by 0.5 percentage points from July
. This 
proba
bly reflect
s Œ at least in part
 Œ the 
appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro from July to August. Domestic producer 
price inflation for non
-food consumer goods weakened only slightly 
to 0.6% 
in August 
from 0.7% in July, remaining in the vicinity of 
its
 longer
-term average. At the earlier 
input stages, 
the annual rate of change in 
producer price
s for intermediate goods 
rose
 slightly from 
-2.0% in July to 
-1.9% in August, while
 the annual rate of change in
 import 
price
s for intermediate goods 
fell
 from
 -2.4% in July to 
-2.6% in August. Global 
non-energy producer price inflation
4 increased in July and August, albeit from low 
levels, and year
-on-year rates of 
change in 
non-oil commodity prices have also been 
rising strongly, suggesting no further weakenin
g of price pressures from the external 
side and at the early stages of the supply chain. However, lower oil prices and a 
stronger nominal effective exchange rate in September may imply continuing 
weakness in domestic intermediate goods prices and import pr
ices beyond August.
 Wage pressures are blurred by the impact of government support measures on 
compensation.
 Growth in compensation per employee and compensation per hour 
diverged strongly in the first half of 2020. Annual growth in compensation per 
employ
ee fell to 
-4.7% in the second quarter, from 0.6% in the first
 quarter
 and 1.6% in 
the fourth quarter of 2019, while annual growth in compensation per hour increased 
from 2.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 4.6% in the first quarter of 2020, and further 
to 9.4% in the second quarter. These contrasting developments reflect the impact of 
short
-time work and temporary lay
-off schemes, under which workers maintained their 
                                                                    4  The global Producer Price Index (PPI) excluding the energy sector is an ECB estimate

5 Negotiated wages, which are not directly affected by 
developments in hours worked and the recording of benefits from job retention 
schemes, grew by 1.7% in the second quarter of 2020, after 1.9% in the first quarter. 
While this implies only a slow w
eakening, the data still include agreements that were 
concluded before the onset of the pandemic.
 The rise in market
-based indicators of longer
-term inflation expectations came 
to a halt at pre
-pandemic levels
 in the period under review (10 September to 28
 October)
, while survey
-based indicators of longer
-term inflation expectations 
were broadly unchanged.
 Market
-based indicators of longer
-term inflation 
expectations reach
ed historical lows in mid

 but then steadily increased
, 
reflecting improvements i
n the global macroeconomic outlook and risk sentiment, as 
well as sizeable monetary and fiscal support. 
In
 the review period,
 however,
 the 
five

-linked swap rate five years ahead did not rise further, 
standing at 1.1
3% on 2
8 October. 
This level is still 4
1 basis points above its historical 
(mid

-based 
indicators of inflation expectations continues to indicate a prolonged period of low 
inflation. Inflation options marke
ts also still signal considerable downside risks in the 
near term, as underlying deflation probabilities remain at historically elevated levels. 
The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2020 
showed shorter
-term HICP inflat
ion expectations edging down slightly further, while 
longer

  21 5 Money and credit
 Broad money growth 
increased further 
in 
September
. The broad monetary 
aggregate (M3) 
recorded
 another large inflow
, pointing to
 an ongoing build
-up of 
liquidity amid uncertainty related to the 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) crisis
. The annual 
growth rate of M3
 increased
 to
 10.4% in 
September 
2020
, after 
9.5% in 
August
 (see 
Chart 1
0). While the 
overall decline
 in economic 
activity
 in 2020 
dampened 
annual 
M3 
growth
, substantial support came from the extraordinary 
liquidity 
demand of firms and 
households in the context of the ample supply of liquidity provided by the Eurosystem
. The increase in M3 was mainly driven by the narrow aggregate M1
, which includes the 
most liquid components of M3. 
The annual growth rate of M1
 increased from
 13.2% in 
August 
to 1
3.8% in 
September. This development was mainly attributable to a further 
increase in 
the annual growth
 rates
 of 
overnight deposits held by firms and 
households, for which
 an important driver was a
 strong preference for liquidity
. 
Other 
short
-ter
m deposits and marketable instruments made a small, positive contribution to 
annual M3 growth in September.
 Domestic c
redit 
has continued to be
 the main source of money creation
. The 
Eurosystem
™s net purchases of government securities 
under the ECB™s asset
 purchase programme 
(APP) and
 the pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(PEPP) made a larger contribution to
 M3 growth
 in September 2020 than in previous 
months 
(see the red portion of
 the bars in Chart 1
0). 
Credit to the private sector
, which 
was mainly d
riven by higher
 loans to non
-financial corporations
, lost some of its 
momentum but still remained at elevated levels
 (see
 the 
blue portion of the 
bars
 in 
Chart 
10). Further support to M3 growth came from
 a modest
 increase in
 the 
contribution from
 credit to 
general
 government from
 monetary financial institutions
 (MFIs
) excluding the Eurosystem
 (see
 the 
light green portion of the 
bars
 in Chart 
10), 
but the respective flows 
have been
 very limited in recent months
. As in previous 
months, the contribut
ion from annual n
et external monetary flows
 remained small in 
September 
(see the 
yellow
 portion of the bars in Chart 
10), while l
onger-term financial 
liabilities 
and other counterparts 
had a 
dampening
 impact on 
broad 
money growth

hly lending flows to NFCs continued to moderate. 
Annual growth of
 loans to households

, from 3.0% in August
. Banks responding to the 
euro area bank
 lending 
survey
 reported a moderate fall in
 firms™ 
net 
loan demand in the third quarter, reflecting 
a decline in emergency liquidity needs and weakening fixed investment
. For the fourth 
quarter of 2020,
 surveyed
 banks rep
orted the
 expectation of a renewed increase
 in 
demand for loans to firms and 
decreasing
 demand 
for loans to
 households
, which may 
signal the re
-emergence of liquidity needs of firms in the context of the intensification 
of the COVID
-19 pandemic
. 
The d
iverg
ence in the dynamics of loans to
 firms
 and loans to 
households
 is driven by the specific nature of the COVID
-19 crisis, which has
 led to a collapse in corporate cash flows and compelled firms to strongly step up their

 (annual growth rate)
  Source: ECB.
 Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling. The latest observation is for 
September 2020
. The October
 2020 euro area bank lending survey
 shows 
a significant tightening of 
credit standards 
for
 loans to firms
 and to households in the third quarter of 
2020, mainly on account of higher risk perceptions
. While 
credit standards were 
supported by government loan guarantees and monetary policy measures, banks 
continued to indicate risk perceptions (related to the deterioration in the general 
economic 
outlook 
and the 
firm
-specific situation) as the main factor contr
ibuting to 
the
ir tightening. For the 
fourth
 quarter of 2020, banks expect 
a further net tightening of 
credit standards for 
firms
. Credit standards 
for
 housing
 loans
 and for consumer credit
 continued to 
tighten s
ignificantly
 in the 
third
 quarter of 2020
, 
against a background of
 deterioratin
g income and employment prospects
. 
Net demand for housing loans and 
for consumer credit 
increased in the 
third
 quarter, 
after a considerable decline in the 
previous quarter
, also benefiting from the temporary abatement o
f the pandemic and 
the concomitant easing of restrictions. 
Banks expect 
a further
 net tightening of credit 
standards
 for households
 and a fall in housing loan demand
 in the 
fourth
 quarter of 
2020. Banks
 also
 indicated that 
the ECB™s
 asset purchase programm
es (APP and 
PEPP) and the third series of targeted
 longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) 
had a positive impact on their
 liquidity
 position and market financing conditions
. Furthermore, t
ogether with the negative deposit facility
 rate,
 banks report
ed that
 these 
measures had an easing impact on bank lending conditions and a
 positive impact on 
lending volumes.
 At the same time, banks suggest
ed that the ECB™s
 asset purchases 
and the negative 
deposit facility rate
 had a negative impact on their net interest
 income, while 
a large percentage of banks reported 
that 
the ECB™s two
-tier system 
supported bank profitability
. Favourable l
ending rates 
have continued to support
 euro area economic 
growth
. Lending rates have st
abilised around their historical lows, broadly in line with 
developments in market reference rates. 
In 
August
 2020 the composite bank lending 
rate
s for loans to NFCs
 and households remained broadly unchanged at 1.51% and 
1.40% respectively
 (see Chart

 1 A revised weighting scheme for the international 
environment projections
 Prepared by 
Mirco Balatti and Philipp Hanheide
 The September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections 
use
d a revised
 weighting scheme for 
the 
euro area™
s trading partners
.6 The country weights are 
important for calculating foreign demand and the export prices of compe
titors. Both of 
these are used as conditioning assumptions in the macroeconomic projections for the 
euro area and for euro area countries.
7 This revision
 follows a 
recent enhancement of 
the
 method employed to
 calculat
e euro 
effective exchange rate 
indices
. The latter was 
done to take 
account 
of 
the 
development
 of international trade linkages and, in 
particular, the growing importance of international trade in services.
8 This box 
discusses the impact of the revised weighting scheme on euro area foreign deman
d and export prices of competitors. It also touches upon updated weights used to 
calculate global aggregates for the purpose of the international environment 
projections prepared by ECB staff.
 Two 
key
 conceptual changes were implemented 
in
 the 
calculati
on 
of country 
weights this year.
 First, data on trade in services were used
 in addition to data on 
trade in goods. Second, the number of euro area trading partners was increased from 
30 to 42, while the remaining countries are consolidated in five regional ag
gregates. 
These changes increased
 the coverage of the 
euro area™s foreign demand
 by 
individual countr
y data
 from 85% to 92%.
 The inclusion of trade in services 
for the purposes of calculating the country
 weights
 reshuffled the weights of the euro area™s ke
y trading partners.
 More 
specifically, the share of the United States and the United Kingdom has increased 
further so that together they account for 29.2% of the euro area™s foreign demand (see 
Chart
 A). Also, Switzerland now accounts for a similar share o
f euro area foreign 
demand to China, which by contrast has seen a slight decline in its weight compared 
to previous values. The weights have fallen for a number of countries, including 
Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey, which are important euro area tr
ading 
partners, but where bilateral trade in goods is greater than trade in services.
                                                                     6  See Box 2,

The reported country weights for 20 important trading partners are use
d to calculate euro area foreign demand in the

relatively modest.
 Zooming in on the contribution of selected country groups, a 
hig
her weight for advanced economies (excluding the euro area) accentuated the role 
of the projected decline in imports in this group of countries for this year, which in turn 
weighed on euro area foreign demand 
(see Chart
 B). For 2021, the contribution of 
advanced economies turned positive. The negative impact from advanced economies 
in 2020 was largely due to the higher weight of the United Kingdom, where imports are 
projected to decline sharply this year, while contributions of non
-euro area EU 
countries in
 central and eastern Europe moved in the opposite direction to advanced 
economies.

 A revised weighting scheme for the international environment projections
  28 The global aggregates for GDP reported for the ECB staff international 
environment projections use a different set of weights, which were also 
updated.
 This update, based
 on GDP measures in purchasing power parity 
(PPP), 
further increase
d the shares of China in 
the global economy.
9 It now commands 
21.2% in 
world
 real 
GDP 
(excl
uding the euro area)
, 
up from 20.7% the year before
. China is also the top exporter (with a 14.5% weight in world exports 
excluding the euro 
area
), while the U
nited States 
remains the most important importer in the world 
economy (17% of world imports excl
uding the euro area
). Taking a longer term perspectiv
e, the 
development
 of shares of world output 
and trade over the last two decades shows the steady rise in the global 
economic weight of China and the downward trend of the U
nited 
States
.10 In 
PPP terms, which accounts for differences in price levels between
 countries, China 
overt
ook the 
United States
 as the world™s largest economy in 2014
 (see Chart
 D).11 Import shares 
show
 a similar 
picture
. While in 1999 there was a
n 18 percentage point
 gap between the two economies in favour of the 
United States
, by 2018 t
his ha
d narrowed to around 5
 percentage points
. While the decline of the 
United States™
 weight in output and imports followed a similar trajectory, in the case of China, import 
shares have grown at a slower pace than its GDP weight. Assuming past (linear) 
trends continue, by 2022 Chinese import volumes would surpass those of the U
nited 
States
, while the wedge in GDP weights would rise further to around 7
 percentage 
points
.                                                                     9  In contrast to market exchange rates, PPP measures are not directly observable. PPP weights, however, 
are less subject to short
-term swings in foreign 
exchange markets and they are more appropriate for 
comparing non
-traded goods and services and analysing welfare.
 The 
global aggregates for GDP reported for the international environment
 are computed using

weights

 New euro area statistics on insurance corporations™ 
premiums, claims and expenses
  30 2 New euro area statistics on insurance corporations™
 premiums, claims and expenses
 Prepared by K
atharina Cera and Niklas Döbbeling
 August 2020 
marked 
the ECB
™s first
 release 
of statistics on insurance 
corporations™ written premiums, incurred claims and acquisition expenses
.12 The data are annual and are available from 2017. For the euro area aggregate
 data, a 
breakdown by type of insurer (reinsurance, life, non
-life and composite) is available. In 
addition, a breakdown by country is also provided for the total insurance sector. These 
data complement the ECB™s quarterly statistics on the assets and liab
ilities of the 
insurance corporation sector.
13 The
 new dataset helps monitor a growing sector that
 is becoming increasingly 
important
 for 
the financing of the economy.
14 In 
the first quarter of 2020
 insurance 
corporations represent
ed 10% of 
the 
total assets
 held by the euro area financial 
sector
. 
Insurers provide important financial services: as well as enabling risk sharing in 
the overall economy, they make it possible for households to store their savings in life 
insurance products. Insurers 
provid
e financi
ng to the economy 
by purchasing
 corporate bonds
. For instance, in the first quarter of 2020 euro area insurers held 25% 
of outstanding domestic non
-financial corporate bonds, while total debt securities 
holdings also accounted for about 40% of insurers™ as
sets
. The total amount of premiums written 
stood at
 •1,127 billion 
at the end of 2019, 
reflecting a
 6.9% year
-on-year 
increase 
(Chart 
A, panel a)
). The growth of 
premiums 
in the
 reinsurance
 (12.2%) and non
-life insurance (9.9%) sectors in 2019
 exceeded
 the
 total insurance corporation sector™s growth for that year. The relatively 
lower growth in the life (6.0%) and composite (3.1%) insurance sectors may reflect
 business model
s that
 have been facing
 profitab
ility challenges
 in the 
prevailing 
low 
interest rate
 environment.
15 Overall, 
premiums written 
are
 a valuable indicator for 
monitoring 
the growth 
of the sector
 as 
they are
 not Œ in contrast to total assets 
Œ subject to
 valuation effects.
 In 2019 in
curred claims 
and their year
-on-year growth remained below the
 amount and growth of premiums written 
(Chart 
A, panel
 b)). Compared
 with 2018, 
incurred claims
 increased by 6.5%
 and corresponded to 13.8% of total insurance 
technical reserves at the end of 2018. Overall claims stood at •822 billion in 2019 with
 claims i
ncurred by life, non
-life and composite insurance corporations each amount
ing
 to between •230 billion and •270 billion
, while
 reinsurance corporations incurred 
claims of •84 billion.
                                                                     12  Premiums written are amounts due during the financial year in respect of insurance contracts, regardless 
of the fact that such amo
unts may relate in whole or in part to a later financial year. Claims incurred relate 
to insured claim events taking place during the financial year. Acquisition expenses comprise 
commission costs
 and the
 costs of selling, underwriting and initiating an in
surance contract, including 
renewal expenses.
 The data are released on the ECB™s 
Statistical Data Warehouse
 (SDW) online 
platform.

 with over 90% of premiums written and 
claims incurred in the country where the head office is located 
(see Chart C
).16 Around 4.5% of premiums were written by branches in other euro area countries, with 
branches located in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands accounting for 
81% of cross
-country branch business within the euro area. In addition, 5.3% of 
premiu
ms were written by branches outside the euro area, with branches in the United 
Kingdom contributing to more than a third of this share.
 The reinsurance sector 
stands out for its 
significant share of cross

business activity
, with a third of premiums 
written via non
-domestic branches.
 Of these, 7% were written in other euro area countries and 26% in the rest of the 
world. Cross
-border activity can expose reinsurers to currency risk, which they may 
need to hedge using derivatives. Indeed, an analysis ba
sed on end

shown that foreign exchange contracts are the second most prevalent derivative 
contract held by the euro area insurance sector after interest rate derivatives.

 Consumption patterns and inflation measurement issues during the COVID

  34 3 Consumption patte
rns and inflation measurement issues
 during the COVID
-19 pandemic
 Prepared by Omiros Kouvavas, Riccardo Trezzi, Martin Eiglsperger,
 Bernhard Goldhammer and Eduardo 
Gonçalves
 The 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic 
has generated challenges in measuring 
consumer
 price inflation as a result of changes in consumption patterns and 
limitations in price collection.
 The pandemic has generated two main challenges 
when measuring consumer price inflation. First, the pandemic triggered unusually 
large changes in household 
spending patterns which are not reflected in aggregated 
consumer price indices.
18 Second, price collection was affected by the lockdown, and 
the missing observations therefore needed to be imputed.
19 This box discusses the 
gap between the 
Harmonised Index of
 Consumer Prices 
(HICP) and 
the 
development 
of prices
 for 
the goods and services actually purchased by final consumers
. The box 
also discusses how imputation has affected published HICP statistics
.20 The HICP is compiled 
using
 consumption weights that are k
ept constant within 
a given calendar year.
 When constructing the HICP, the price changes of individual 
items are weighted using household consumption shares that are fixed for the 
calendar year. This 
reflects the 
intended 
purpose 
of the HICP 
of estimating 
pure 
price 
changes without accounting for 
shifts in household consumption patterns
. The HICP 
weights are 
primarily 
based on
 past years™
 national accounts
 data, which are 
adapted 
in an effort to be representative of the previous year™s consumption shares.
21 This 
means, for example, that the 2020 HICP weights mainly reflect 2018 household 
consumption. While keeping the weights constant within a calendar year does not 
generate measurement issues in normal times, the nature of the pandemic shock has 
triggered la
rge consumption shifts over a short period of time.
 There is a growing body of literature documenting large pandemic
-induced 
changes in household consumption and discussing their implications for 
inflation.
 Using high
-frequency data, several studies have i
dentified large changes in 
                                                                    18  Consu
mer price indices (CPIs) use a fixed basket approach. This means that they keep expenditure 
weights constant between the base period and the reference period, assuming that relative consumption 
shares do not change. Therefore they do not capture changes in
 consumption patterns.
 19  For a detailed discussion on this point, see the box entitled ﬁ
Inflation measurement in times of economic 
distre
ssﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue 3, ECB, 2020.
 20  Aspects related to social, health and environmental phenomena can have an impact on household utility 
related to consumption. Specific
 theoretical
 inflation measurement concepts try to account for some of 
thes
e factors. However, there is no such quality adjustment in the HICP for a 
possible 
fall in the utility 
of 
certain services 
owing 
to infection risks and social distancing requirement
s such 
as 
those 
currently 
being 
experienced by consumers. An assessment of 
this issue is outside the scope of this box
, which 
focuses 
on 
changing consumption patterns
. 21  The derivation of the weights is laid down in 
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1
148 of 31 
July 2020 laying down the methodological and technical specifications in accordance with Regulation 
(EU) 2016/792 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards harmonised indices of

 Consumption patterns and inflation measurement issues during the COVID

  35 spending across product categories
.22 These time
-varying expenditure shares
23 have 
been used to quantify the difference between published consumer price indices and 
the inflation rate of the items actually purchased by consumers.
24 Following this 
approach
, two statistical agencies have published experimental price indices with 
monthly time
-varying weights showing how the pandemic has 
affected
 consumer 
spending and that a 
gap has 
opened up between CPI
-type inflation 
figures 
and the 
inflation rate of the items actually purchased by final consumers.
25 Using publicly available data, we have estimated a monthly
-reweighted 
consumer price index for the euro area.
 Several steps are needed to construct a 
monthly
-reweighted consumer price index.
 First, nominal m
onthly turnover
 data for the 
retail trade and for other services (e.g. transport services) are matched
 to the 
corresponding HICP categories.
26 While retail trade turnover data primarily reflect 
transactions
 driven by household
 purchases
, tu
rnover of other services includes 
business
-to
-business transactions which need to be stripped out. Second, taking the 
latest HICP weights as a base, the evolution of the spending categories is estimated 
using the corresponding nominal turnover growth rates
.27 Third, relative weights are 
used to construct the monthly
-reweighted consumer price index.
28 By design, our 
index captures part of the changes in consumption during the pandemic and therefore 
comes closer to the rate of change in the prices of items actu
ally purchased by 
consumers during this period.
                                                                     22  Consumption of food items has increased and remains relatively high because households are spending 
more time at home (effectively switching away from food served in bars, restaurants and cafés). See the

 27  The latest HICP weights 
reflect expenditure shares calculated 
using 
mainly 2018 data
. 28  The index calculation in this 
box is experimental. Data used for estimating monthly expenditure weights 
are compiled according to concepts and classifications 
that 
differ from the definition of consumption 
underlying the HICP. The match to HICP categories is therefore imperfect, particu
lar
ly where monthly 
turnover data are used
, as
 these data 
also include transactions
 between 
firms
. The sources used 
to 
estimate
 monthly weight
s are less reliable than 
official HICP expenditure 
sources.
 Our (unchained) index 
assumes the same scope and cover
age as the HICP. This implies that the items included in our index are 
the same as those in the HICP. It also implies that the monthly price changes of the individual items are 
the same as those of the HICP. In other words, the main difference between our 
index and the HICP is 
that we allow the spending weights to change from one month to the next, while the HICP keeps them 
constant. For the formula, we have employed a Fisher index.

 The available data suggest that household consumption patterns have changed 
significantly during the pandemic.
 Relative consumption
 patterns
 were
 stable until 
the beginning of the pandemic
 (see Chart A), but t
he pandemic and the
 lockdown
 meas
ures
 led to a 
large 
increase 
in the weight of some categories (such as 
food 
items
 and communication services)
 and a reduction 
in other categories 
(such as
 recreation 
and energy
 goods)
. 
Most of the pandemic
-induced shifts have been temporary, such 
as for 
semi
-durable goods, which includes a diverse set of items such as clothing, 
books and small utensils. However, shares of spending on food items and recreation 
services show persistent deviations from pre
-pandemic trends, as some of the 
restrictions remain 
in place. As 
Chart A 
reports
 relative weights
, some categories
 show an increase
 in March/April because the
 nominal spending 
in that category 
contracted less than overall consumption
. Table A shows our estimates of the 
development of nominal household spend
ing across categories.

 Since the beginning of the pandemic, inflation as measured by our 
experimental index has been running higher than HICP inflation, and the 
difference has remained broadly stable in recent
 months.
 Chart B shows the gap 
between the annual rates of change (year
-on-year) of the experimental index and the 
HICP (the orange line in panel a). This gap started to open up in March (as shown by 
the orange bars in panel b) and increased to about 0.2 p
ercentage points
 in April.
30 Since then, it has remained roughly constant.
31 Intuitively, this reflects consumers 
switching from lower
-than
-average inflation categories (such as fuel for transport, 
covered by ﬁEnergyﬂ) to higher
-than
-average inflation catego
ries (such as food items). 
Chart B also shows the contributions from food and energy items (the blue bars in 
panel a) and core items (the yellow bars in panel a). Until June, t
he difference
 between 
the experimental index and the HICP was driven mainly by f
ood and energy items, 
while the remaining items contributed to more than half of the gap in July.
                                                                     30  Our results are in line with evidence from similar studies outside the euro area.
 31  Because our analysis is at COICOP
-2 level, the gap between our index and HICP inflation reflects only 
the upper
 level of changes in consumption patterns during lockdown (in particular, the gap reflects 
switching between food and energy items and core items at COICOP
-2 level). The gap between our 
index and the HICP has remained fairly constant in recent months becau
se the change in weights has 
resulted in a lasting shift in the level of the series.

some extent, in 2022, at least with respect to expenditure weights.
 This box 
presented the estimated impact of measurement challenges triggered by the

changing consumption
 patterns and price collection difficulties brought on by the 
lockdown measures. Measurement issues had an impact on published statistics in the 
first few months of the pandemic, but they have significantly decreased in recent 
months. Going forward, should
 the pandemic continue, some measurement 
challenges will remain in 2021. This will also be the case in 2022, when 2020

 1 Introduction
 Potential output is typically defined as the highest level of economic activity 
that can be sustained by means of the available technology and factors of 
produ
ction without 
pushing inflation above its target
. Attempts to exceed this 
level of production will lead to rising levels of factor utilisation
 (and a positive output 
gap, defined as the difference between actual and potential output)
, thereby putting 
upwar
d pressure on factor costs and ultimately on consumer price inflation. 
In 
contrast, when actual output is lower than potential output, there is slack in the 
economy (the output gap turns negative), putting downward pressure on factor costs 
and consumer pri
ce inflation. 
Since potential output cannot be observed d
irectly, it 
must be 
inferred from
 existing data using statistical and econometric
 methods
. 
There 
are various methods for estimating and projecting potential output and they are all 
subject to 
considerable uncertainty.
37 The 
large 
macroeconomic shock stemming from the 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic has affected both supply and demand.
 Potential 
output 
typically 
reflects 
supply conditions in the economy, such as changes in the key production inpu
ts of 
capital and labour and their productivity. 
At the same time, fluctuations around 
potential output are related to demand factors.
38 The measures 
imposed by 
governments 
to contain the spread of the virus 
in the aftermath of the COVID
-19 shock 
are
 a uniq
ue example
 of 
severe temporary 
supply
-side restrictions. This raises the 
question
: to what extent 
has 
potential output been affected
. This 
article discusses the impact of the 
COVID
-19 pandemic on euro area 
potential output.
 It presents some conceptual issu
es and discusses the channels 
through which the pandemic and containment measures have affected and will likely 
continue to affect potential output. The article discusses the nature of the shock and 
describes channels through which the pandemic and the rel
ated containment 
measures could alter the contributions of labour, capital and total factor productivity 
(TFP) to potential output in the euro area. Finally, the article introduces a range of 
quantitative estimates of the impact of the pandemic. These are 
highly preliminary in 
                                                                    37  See the article entitled 
ﬁPotential output in the post
-crisis period
ﬂ, Economic Bulletin
, Issue 7
, ECB, 
2018
. 38  Potential output estimates are often procyclical and reflect developments in
 demand conditions. On the 
one hand, t
his procyclicality could partly be a statistical artefact due to methodological issues, such as 
the well
-known end
-point problem of filtering procedures.
 On the other hand, it could also reflect business 
cycle fluctuations, for example in investments in physical capital, or in research and development and 
innovation, leading to procyclical estimates of the capital stock and trend TFP growth.

 The impact of COVID
-19 on potential output in the euro area
  43 that only two quarters of macroeconomic data have been released between the 
outbreak of the pandemic and the time of writing and the duration of the pandemic is 
highly uncertain (as are other factors, such as how long and to which deg
ree 
containment measures will remain in place, when a vaccine or pharmaceutical 
solution will arrive and what the long
-term implications for public health will be). In this 
context, the quantitative estimates should serve to gauge the mechanics involved, 
while ex post revisions can be expected as the magnitude of the crisis becomes 
clearer.
 2 The nature of the 
COVID
-19 shock
 The interpretation of potential output during the shock
 The level of potential output during the 
COVID
-19 crisis depends on what can 
be considered 
the 
full capacity of the economy.
 When lockdown measures are in 
effect
, the factors of production are still in place
, but are prevented from being 
utilised 
fully. In this situation
, the
 full capacity of the economy and hence the degree of 
capa
city utilisation and the size of the output gap
39 may be very different from their 
levels
 in normal times
. Chart 1 illustrates t
wo extreme interpretations for the period
 in 
which national 
lockdown
s were imposed and business operations were restricted,
 as 
well as when containment measures were subsequently lifted
. The first interpretation 
assumes that the available factors of production are not affected by the lockdown and 
the related containment measures. 
For instance, 
a restaurant still has the same 
numbe
r of tables as before and a car assembly plant the same number of machines. 
The number of 
employees
 available is also unchanged, even if they 
are, for example, 
working fewer hours
, on short
-time working schemes or temporarily absent
. Finally, 
technology do
es not change significantly in short periods of time
 and remains 
available
. 
Under
 this interpretation, the degree of full capacity is unchanged during the 
lockdown
 (see Chart 1, upper panel, blue line).
 When containment m
easures are 
gradually lifted, produ
ction factors
 are 
fully u
tili
sed again (interpretation 1). 
By 
contrast, a
 second interpretation 
assumes
 that during the lockdown, none of the 
resources are available 
for production
 (i.e
. the restaurant and the plant are closed and 
the workers need to stay 
at home). 
This
 implies that 
full 
capacity collapses to zero in 
firms that are closed, equivalent to a temporary steep drop in supply and thus in 
potential output
 (see Chart 1, upper panel, yellow line)
. As soon as the lockdown is 
over and containment measu
res are gradually 
being 
lifted, the degree of full capacity 
will gradually recover towards its
 pre
-crisis
 level (interpretation
 2).
 These interpretations imply very different output gaps as a result of the large 
fluctuations in the actual level of output d
uring the crisis.
 In the first 
interpretation, the output gap becomes negative during the lockdown period (see 
Chart 1, lower panel, blue line), as actual output falls well below full capacity, which 
                                                                    39  Normally, c
apacity utilisation represents the output gap
 well: ﬁcapacity utilisation is usually defined as the 
ratio of actual output to some measure of potential outputﬂ (
see 
Nelson,
 Randy A., 
ﬁOn the Measurement 
of Capacity Utilization
ﬂ, The Journal of Industrial Economics
, Vol. 37, No 3, Wiley, March 1989, pp. 
273
-286
). It follows that full capacity of the economy corresponds to potential output.

 The impact of COVID
-19 on potential output in the euro area
  44 by contrast remains unaffected overall. In the second in
terpretation, however, the 
output gap is not affected by the lockdown (see Chart 1, lower panel, yellow line), 
since actual production is the same as the assumed full capacity. Potential output 
falls to the same extent as GDP. These two interpretations are
 of course illustrative 
extremes and, in practice, the truth lies somewhere in between. This is especially 
true at the aggregate level, given that the impact of the shock on full capacity has 
been different across sectors (not least because of differences 
in the scope for 
working remotely).

-19: interplay of supply and demand
 shocks
 The choice of interpretations outlined 
above determines the degree of 
cyclicality of potential output in the short term.
 The more potential output is 
assumed to be affected by the containment measures, the more potential output will 
fluctuate in the short term as restrictions are enforced and l
ifted. The less that is 
assumed to be case, the steadier potential output will stay. Different empirical

 The impact of COVID
-19 on potential output in the euro area
  45 approaches can help to establish which interpretation is matched by data, i.e. the 
degree to which supply, and with it also potential output, has been 
affected.
 Given data limitations, the complex nature of the shock 
and the 
interdependence of supply and demand factors, 
disentangling 
these
 factors is 
a challenging task.
40 As such, changes in the one might affect the other component. 
In that respect, a rec
ent theoretical 
study
 suggests
 that a supply shock, affecting 
sectors of the economy asymmetrically, may 
in turn 
trigger demand contraction
s.41 At 
the same time, as the great financial crisis showed, demand
-side factors may also 
have persistent or even perm
anent impacts on potential output.
42 Empirical analyses, based on limited data, find that both supply and demand 
dropped after the COVID
-19 shock.
 In the United States, a study was conducted 
using d
ata on hours worked and wages to estimate labour demand and
 supply shocks 
for the aggregate economy and for 
various
 sectors
. It found that 
labour supply shocks 
accounted for a larger share of the fall in hours, 
although 
both shocks were 
noteworthy.
43 Another paper identified the supply and demand shocks from 
real
-time 
survey data on inflation and real GDP growth
 and found that in the first quarter of 2020 
negative demand had a bigger role in the fall in activity, but in the second quarter 
reduced supply played a more significant role.
44 Other data and methods suggest
 that 
demand factors were stronger and could be explained by uncertainty or fear of 
infection.
45 Overall, in the United States, empirical studies found that both supply and 
demand had an important role and, since the nature of the shock was the same across 
the globe, it can be reasonably assumed that the same holds for the euro area as 
well.
46 It was possible for the effects of broader supply
-side restrictions to be 
attenuated in sectors that were able to maintain and adapt production
. Production was maintain
ed in sectors that were considered to be essential while, at 
least in some countries and regions, production was cut back in non
-essential sectors. 
In addition, the degree to which work could be carried out remotely influenced the 
decline in activity. Empi
rical papers found that the ability to telework varies greatly
                                                                     40  Barry Eichengreen said

  46 across sectors and

47 and in Europe
48, and the supply
-side effect of the COVID

fewer workers were able to carry

This chart shows GDP for the five years before and after the exogenous shock
 for an aggregation of the euro area countries
. The legend indicates the 
dates chosen for t0, which is the yea
r before the shock, or, if the shock hit only in the second half of the year, the year of the shock itself. 
The shocks included in 
the range include the influenza pandemic in 1918
-19, the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979 and the great financial crisis in 
2007-08. The solid lines reflect the 
latest projections by the international organisations, where t0 is the 2019 level of GDP.
 The great influenza pandemic does not appear to have resulted in a statistically significant lasting 
adverse effect
 on the GDP gr
owth rate
. That pandemic, which propagated worldwide in 1918
-19 (namely in the last years of 
World War I
), had a direct impact on labour input. It resulted in high fatality 
rates in the working age population,
53 absenteeism and shutdowns of businesses. The 
COVID
-19 shock, however, is associated with a much lower fatality rate among the working age population. 
Moreover, its economic impact is more 
related to 
the containment measures
 aimed at 
protect
ing
 the 
population
 and it has resulted in
 confidence and unce
rtainty shock
s that have 
affect
ed both 
households and businesses, 
with 
some sectors
 more affected than others. Estimating a 
vector error 
correction model 
including fatality rate determinants 
(see below
) for the period 1901
-25, we find that 
the great influe
nza pandemic had a negative impact on GDP growth. 
However, the effect 
on GDP 
growth 
is estimated to have been 
temporary
, in contrast to the shock 
concomitant with 
World War I.
54 By contrast, the rises in oil prices of 1973 and 1979 were permanent and had a 
more lasting effect on 
euro area 
GDP growth rates
. The oil price shocks 
largely
 hit European economies, with productivity 
being the main channel of economic growth affected.
55 While this shock primarily affected supply, it 
also had an impact on demand, as 
income and spending were squeezed in oil
-importing countries. 
The oil 
price increase was permanent: t
he level of oil price
s never 
return
ed to 
that
 observed in the 
early 1970s
. Accordingly, we find that the oil price shocks had a permanent negative effect o
n GDP

 The COVID
-19 shock is expected to be followed by a larger drop in GDP in the euro area than 
previous exogenous shocks or the great 
financial crisis. This
 reflects the large expected short
-run 
effect of the shock, although the uncertainty about the longer run remains high. It should also be 
noted that in the second half of 2020, a strong rebound in economic activity is expected, which 
was 
not the case during the 2007
-08 financial crisis. T
ransferring the results from 
this box 
to the current 
shock, its long
-term damage to the economy could be hoped to be rather small should the shock fade 
out rather quickly (i.e. 
if 
a vaccine
 is found th
at ensures that the shock is not lasting or recurring).
  4 COVID
-19: c
hannels of impact on potential output
 The 
coronavirus and
, in particular
, the related 
containment and
 lockdown 
measures are likely to affect most components of potential output.
 The channels 
are discussed below for each component (TFP, capital and labour), also with reference 
to experience during and after the great financial 
crisis.
 The 
coronavirus and containment measures 
negatively 
affect trend TFP 
through several channels.
 Sup
ply chain disruption might be 
persistent
 and firms 
might need 
to find new suppliers, new transport routes 
or new locations
 of production
. This might be 
exacerbated
 if the current pandemic 
increases
 protectionism and 
accelerates de
-globalisation. 
If this is
 the case, 
sectors that have 
greatly benefited in 
terms of productivity growth from international exposure and globalisation might 
experience a decline in trend TFP. 
Financial distress might increase the financing cost 
of new, productive projects and might
 also increase corporate default rates
 (see Box 
2 for a more detailed analysis
). 
The destruction of jobs resulting from a surge in firm 
exit
s would potentially lead 
to productivity losses if
 reallocation of displaced workers to 
other firms 
is slow and resu
lts in a deterioration of 
workers™ 
skills
 in the long
 run.
 However, a few factors might counterbalance the negative impact on trend TFP.
 The COVID
-19 shock has had an asymmetric impact on various sectors of activity and 
might, therefore, result in TFP
-enhancing 
sector reallocation
. This may be the case if 
some low
-productivity 
sectors
 are more persistently affected and lose economic 
importance to the benefit of less affected high
-productivity sectors. For example, 
during the great financial crisis, i
n some 
countries, notably in Spain and in Italy, trend 
TFP growth started
 to 
improve
 as the crisis wa
s seen as increasing allocative 
efficiency

-productive construction sector to the

Moreover

57 Box 2

vity

.58 Nevertheless, the overall 
negative 
impact on trend TFP and its contribution to potentia
l growth might be considerable
. The 
COVID
-19 shock 
may negatively 
affect
 the capital stock in the euro area
, mainly 
through lower i
nvest
ment
. First
 and foremost, despite supportive financing 
conditions, the high level of uncertainty 
could adversely affect investment decisions.
 Furthermore, t
he decline
 in value added 
could 
also 
hit investment (accentuated by the 
ﬁaccelerator effect
ﬂ), while
 falling
 corporate margins 
could 
dampen
 investment 
expenditures
. Capital
 scrapping and depreciation may be affected by two offsetting effect
s. Company liquidations might 
entail 
some of 
the 
capital 
assets being 
scrapped before 
the end of 
their
 service life
 (see also Box 2)
. On a positive note, the lifespan of existing 
assets may 
be extended
 thanks to
 less intensive utilisation 
if they 
were
 shut 
down
 during the lockdown. 
The equipment of firms where employees work largely from 
home might also wear out more slowly, since equipment might be provided by the 
workers rather than the firm. 
During the 
great financial crisis
, it seems that the 
former
 effect predominated, leading t
o an increase in 
the 
average scrapping rate of capital 
assets
.59 The
 sectors most affected by the decline in activity are also those that 
contribute the most to 
changes in
 the euro area productive capital stock.
 Traditionally, the manufacturing and retail t
rade, transport (including travel), 
accommodation (including hotels) and food and beverage sectors have been the 
largest contributors to developments in investment in machinery and equipment. 
The 
first available data point to a substantial deterioration in
 investment
 in 2020, but a 
rebound in economic activity and investments is expected in the second half of the 
year. While the
 contraction in the first half of 2020 
could lead to a permanent 
reallocation of capital 
from the sectors most affected, 
the
 overal
l impact 
on potential 
output depends on how persistently investments are ultimately curtailed.
 The labour contribution to potential output could be severely hit but is currently 
significantly supported by sizeable policy measures.

 The impact of COVID
-19 on potential output in the euro area
  51 schemes introduced in many countries
60 have the potential to limit hysteresis and 
longer
-term scarring in the euro area labour market. However, in the event
 of a more 
lasting shock
 and the eventual scaling down of mitigating policies
, hysteresis effects 
could
 emerge, resulting in a
 more persistent
 increase in the
 non-accelerating inflation 
rate of unemployment 
(NAIRU)
. 
This can happen if people become long
-term 
unemployed, which tends primarily to affect the y
ounger and lower skilled
. Based on
 the experience o
f the 
great financial crisis
, 
we can
 assume that the NAIRU 
will
 rise 
again. There are, however, some differences 
here between that crisis and the present 
one. (i) 
The increase 
of the NAIRU 
during the 
great financial crisis
 partially reflect
ed the 
impact of the second phase of 
the
 crisis
, which was relatively severe
. (ii) 
The NAIRU is estimated to have declined significantly in recent years, reflecting 
more flexible labour markets 
as a result of
 reforms in several euro area countries. The 
highe
r labour market flexibility might reduce the extent to which the NAIRU rise
s in the 
face of the current shock
. (iii) 
In contrast to the present shock, t
he great financial crisis
 mostly 
affected
 the 
construction sector and industry, but seemed to be smaller
 in market services
, which 
have a high weight in the value added of the total economy
. The 
COVID
-19 shock, 
however, is assumed to 
be affect
ing
 all 
major
 sectors to a considerable degree and 
this simultaneous decline may increase the probability of hysteres
is effects
 occurring
. 
In some industrial and market services subsectors, the shock can also trigger or 
accelerate 
structural changes. This may imply a larger and more immediate impact on 
the 
NAIRU than
 that
 seen 
as a result of
 the 
great financial crisis
. If the shock turns out to be more persistent, 
working age population growth
 could slow due to lower migration.
 Immigration has had an upward impact on 
working age population growth in the euro area recently. 
Cross
-border and immigrant 
workers tend to work i
n sectors 
that are considerably 
affected by the shock (for 
example accommodation, retail trade
 and food service)
. Due also to a higher share of 
precarious contracts, they may be more vulnerable to dismissal.
 In addition, 
tighter
 travel restrictions may pre
vail for an extended period of time and the willingness of 
workers to move might decrease. This, however, may also cushion the reaction of the 
NAIRU
 to
 the shock in net immigration countries. Due t
o differences in net 
immigration
, the impact may vary consi
derably across euro area countries.
 Other components of trend labour input 
might also be 
affected
. The continuation 
of the recent rise in the trend participation rate may be at risk
, for example in 
the 
case 
of 
older workers withdraw
ing
 from the labour mark
et 
in the aftermath of the shock
.61 Trend participation of women may also 
be affected
 as they are more represented in 
the sectors 
hit harder
 by the shock (e.g. accommodation and food service activities; 
the 
arts, entertainment
 and recreation)
, compared with
 other sectors less affected

 The impact of COVID
-19 on potential output in the euro area
  52 Both groups 
have made
 a considerable contribution to the rising trend labour force 
participation rate in recent decades.
 The impact of the shock on components of potential 
output 
may depend on 
which sectors are mo
re affected
. The current shock may 
have a 
more permanent 
impact 
on some service sectors, primarily those that have been relying on the benefits 
of globalisation
 Œ namely accommodation, travel
 and transportation
. But domestic 
service
 sectors
 may also be negatively 
affe
cted
 in the longer term. The expansion of 
services seen in 
recent 
decades supported employment growth and likely contributed 
to the rise of labour supply. A
n L-shaped shock in these sectors may increase the 
possibility of declining trend labour input, thro
ugh the NAIRU
, but also 
potentially
 through
 the
 trend participation rate. In addition, as described above, capital can be 
negatively affected. In manufacturing, purchases of goods (as opposed to services) 
can be postponed and pent
-up demand may imply stron
ger growth
 later. However, at 
least some subsectors may be permanently 
affected
 as the current shock may 
coincide with the impact of ongoing structural challenges. 
By contrast, a
 permanent 
shock to 
some manufacturing
 sector
s may increase the probability of
 a larger shock to 
capital and TFP components.
 Box 
2 The impact 
on potential output 
of a surge in firm exit
s as a result of COVID
-19  Prepared by Paloma Lopez
-Garcia
 Whether the current crisis will leave long
-term scars 
will 
depend, 
among other things, on the number 
and nature of companies that default as a result of the liquidity strains caused by the lockdown and 
containment measures. 
This box uses 
Orbis and iBACH
-sourced 
financial accounts
 of firms 
operating in the
 private sector
 of four euro area countries (
Germany, Spain, France and Italy
) to 
approximate the number of firms at risk of default as a result of the lockdowns and subsequent weak 
economic growth. The objective of the analysis is to measure the economic impacts of a surg
e in firm 
exit
s on the drivers of potential output, 
these being
 employment, capital and productivity growth.
 To gauge the magnitude of the impacts, the analysis simulates the dynamics of the liquidity of firms 
over time. 
The 
sudden collapse in revenues of 
firms as a result of the lockdowns together with their 
limited 
capacity to adjust costs have shocked 
the
 liquidity buffers 
firms have 
built 
up over 
recent
 years. 
In order t
o flag firms 
facing 
liquidity shortfalls as a result of the shock
63, 
it is assumed th
at 
the
 liquidity
 of firms
 at any month 
t is equal to the remaining liquidity from the previous month plus 
monthly sales net of operating costs.
64 Revenues change according to sector
-specific value added 
consistent with expected headline GDP. The ability of 
firms to adjust costs, however, depends on
 estimated 
elasticities of intermediate and labour expenses to changes in firm
-level turnover
.65  Our analysis shows that Spain is the most affected country, with about 25% of the population of firms 
with employees 
at risk of becoming illi
quid at the peak of the crisis (28% of employees) assuming no 
                                                                    63  Hence the analysis accounts only for firms that were liquid before the COVID
-19 crisis.

(see 
Chart A
, upper panel, blue bar
).66, 67 The results are in line
 with
 or some
what
 below other estimates
 (e.g. those of the European Commission or the OECD)
.68 Firms with strong 
balance sheets
, however,
 could partially weather the losses 
incurred 
by relying on working capital 
buffers
. In the light of this, 
the share of firms running into negative working capi
tal is also computed
 (see 
Chart A
, upper panel, orange bar
). Further
more
, among 
all those 
firms under stress, i.e. at risk of 
either 
liquidity or working capital shortages, the highly leveraged ones might encounter difficulties in 
raising external finance 
to cover temporary shortages and
 might
 therefore default.
69 According to this 
criterion, about three
-quarters of the firms identified as 
encountering
 liquidity or working capital 
shortfalls are at risk of exit. They account for 10% to 23% of all firms with 
employees
, and between 
10% and 17% of employees in the non
-financial business sector (see 
Chart A
, upper
 panel, dots).
 The rapid implementation of policies to support the liquidity of firms has significantly reduced the 
share of firms under stress as a res
ult of the lockdowns.
 One of
 the most effective policies has been 
the introduction of s
hort
-time working schemes
, which
 allow firms to reduce their wage bill by 
temporarily transferring part of the labour costs to governments. They also keep workers attach
ed to 
their firms, preserving the valuable worker
-firm link. In order to evaluate their effectiveness, 
it is 
assumed
 that firms™ labour costs are reduced 
in 
proportion to the share of workers covered by the 
schemes in each country, wh
ich averages 40% of em
ployees. 
Chart 
A (upper panel)
 shows that the 
short
-time working
 schemes halve the share of firms under liquidity stress in most countries
, and 
reduce by almost two
-thirds the employment at risk,
 given that labour costs account for a large part of 
firms™ o
perating costs. 
These schemes
, however,
 are not 
as effective in reducing the number of firms 
at risk of working capital shortfalls. The reason 
for this 
is that cash accounts for about 20% of firms™ 
current assets. 
The schemes 
therefore 
affect a relatively 
small part of firms™ working capital.
                                                                     66  If the analysis 
also 
took into account corporations with no employees and 
sole traders
, the share of firms 
at risk of illiquidity would go up in all countries by about 5 percentage points. 
If the 
original 
analysis 
included 
firms that were 
illiquid 
at the 
start 
of the crisis
, the share of illiquid firms at 
its 
peak could double 
in all countr
ies.
 67  The 
severe
 impact of the crisis on 
Spain
, and to a lesser extent on Italy, is grounded 
in its sector 
composition and 
the 
dominance of micro firms in the productive structure.
 68  The most similar study, although with better Italian data, is Schivard
i and 
Romano, op. cit.,
 who estimate 
that about 20% of firms in Italy might be at risk. The E
uropean 
Commission
 estimates that 35% of firms 
across 
the 
EU27 would be under liquidity stress in their intermediate scenario
, whereas the OECD 
estimates that abou
t 30% of firms would be at risk of illiquidity after two months of lockdown.

 The impact of firm exit on aggregate productivity growth is ambiguou
s. Besides the expected 
negative impacts of firm exit on TFP growth listed in the main text, the current crisis could have a 
silver lining for TFP growth. 
Indeed, sector reallocation triggered by the loss in economic importance 
of 
low
-productive
 sectors li
ke 
those related to 
tourism and the gain 
in high
-productive ones 
could 
increase aggregate TFP growth in the medium
 term. Further
more
, if low
-productive firms are 
relatively more affected by the shock
, there could be a ﬁcleansing effectﬂ. 
It is possible, ho
wever, that 
the latter will contribute relatively less to aggregate TFP growth than in previous crises. The reason is 
that the COVID
-19 shock is not economic in nature and could therefore affect both productive and 
unproductive firms in any given sector.
70 Last and most importantly, the acceleration of digital uptake 
by the corporate sector could result in positive productivity impacts in the medium
-term.
 To conclude, the large potential economic costs of a surge in firm exits as a result of the COVID
-19 sho
ck justify the large support schemes implemented by all European governments. 
However
, if 
those schemes are withdrawn before 
the revenues
 of firms 
from activity
 recover,
 we could see some 
                                                                    70  ECB internal work confirms that whereas the average productivity of
 firms at risk of exit in Spain and Italy 
is clearly lower than that of other firms, this is not the case in Germany and France. In the latter two 
countries the productivity of firms at risk of exit is similar to that of less vulnerable firms, even after 
controlling for sector of activity. This is different from other crises, in which exiting firms were significantly 
less productive than incumbents.

  5 Quantitative estimates of the impact
 of COVID
-19 on potential output
 This section reviews recent estimates of potential output and several statis
tical 
methods.
 This section presents the 
unobserved 
component
s model (UCM)
, which is a key 
tool in the assessment of potential growth within the euro area
.71 The
 UCM 
combines a multivariate filter approach with a Cobb
-Douglas production function 
relating po
tential output to labour, capital and TFP. The underlying model is a 
backward
-looking state
-space model that decomposes four key observable variables 
(real GDP, the unemployment rate, a measure of core inflation and
 another of
 wage 
inflation) into trend an
d cyclical components. 
It relies on several economic 
relationships
 for this
, including a Cobb
-Douglas production function, a wage and a 
price Phillips curve
, and an Okun™s law
72 relationship. In the model, a closed output 
gap is consistent with the absence 
of excessive price or wage pressures.
73 At 
this point in time
, modelling potential growth and trend
-cycle breakdowns is 
a challenging exercise.
 The nature and magnitude of the shock (see Section 2) and 
its far
-reaching implications, especially 
for
 the labou
r market
, and extensive 
government interventions 
make it necessary to
 adjust
 the normal set
-up of the UCM
. 
Without being exhaustive, a few aspects that needed to be modified are listed below. 
First, given the sharp drop in activity in the first half of 202
0, the UCM applied to the 
1995-2022 period as a whole would lead to a substantial downward revision of 
potential growth in the period preceding the crisis. To avoid this statistical artefact, 
potential output estimate is frozen prior to 2020 and is then ov
erlaid with the estimate 
carried out for the period 2020
-22. Moreover, some economic relationships are 
temporarily affected by the shock, such as the Okun
™s law. This relationship had to be 
adjusted to allow for GDP to fall more than unemployment has risen
. Finally, a degree 
of judg
ement
 had to be introduced on certain variables such as the NAIRU or the 
average number of hours worked so that their trend 
would 
better reflect foreseeable 
medium
-term
 and long
-term 
changes
. Potential growth in the euro area is 
estimated to have been severely affected 
throughout
 the current crisis.
 Conditional 
on the Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic 
projections of December 2019, the UCM would 
originally 
have suggested that 
potential output was likely to evolve in line with 
observat
ions
 in recent 
years, between 
                                                                    71  The estimates presented in this section are conditional on the September 2020 ECB staff projections.
 72  Okun™s law links cyclical unemployment to the output gap.
 73  The UCM approach estimates the trends of the different production function inputs jointly in a system of 
equations in which the trend
-cycle decomposition is subject to certain key, albeit reduced
-form, economic 
relationships. For further explanation, see Tóth, M., ﬁAn Unobserved Components Model to Estimate 
Potential Output in the Euro Area

 The impact of COVID
-19 on potential output in the euro area
  57 1% and 2% annually between 2020 and 2022. The COVID
-19 crisis has changed the 
picture, as the latest estimates based on the September 2020 
staff macroeconomic 
projections 
indicate that potential growth would average between 
-0.3 and 1.1% 
annually between 2020 and 2022
 (see Chart 2, upper panel
). Compared with the 
great 
financial crisis
, the impact is much larger. In the wake of the previous crisis, potential 
growth only fell 
by 
somewhere between 
0.0% and 0.7% per year
. Potentia
l output 
would, however, fall less than real GDP, resulting in an unprecedented drop in the 
output gap
 (see Chart 2, lower panel)

. This 
can be illustrated with the cumulative loss 
of potential output estimated with the UCM between December
 2019 and September 
2020 (see Chart 3

would reach almost 
3% by the end of 2022.

 The impact of COVID
-19 on potential output in the euro area
  58 pre
-crisis rates, the potential output level would be affected
 for longer
. The UCM 
provides a 
tentative
 outlook on the future level of potential output. The projection falls 
between th
at of the IMF and th
at of the European Commission. Nevertheless, all these 
estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, as indicated by the shaded areas in 
the 
charts
 above
, accounting for a range 
between
 estimat
ions
 of 95%. Furthermore, 
cauti
on is warranted when using such gaps as a proxy for the impact of the crisis. 
Real
-time estimates of potential output are often subject to substantial revisions, 
especially in times of crisis, and estimates of the euro area aggregate mask significant 
heter
ogeneity across individual euro area countries.

 Note: 
This chart shows the difference in the level of potential outp
ut 
before the crisis 
levels and 
based on the 
most recent estimates.
 According to the UCM, the contribution of labour is pivotal 
to the changes in 
potential output.
 The contribution of labour to potential growth can be traced back to 
trends in 
the working age population, 
the labour force, the unemployment rate and 
hours worked per employee. Estimates of the UCM show that the
 latter
 two 
components would see their trend affected most by the current crisis. The NAIRU 
would rise significantly and re
main elevated even in 2022 due to hysteresis 
phenomena. However, this effect 
might be mitigated by 
short
-time working schemes
, which is not fully captured by the UCM. 
Trend average hours worked would weigh on 
potential growth until the end of 2021 before h
aving a positive effect in 2022. More 
incidentally, 
capital 
stock would also contribute to the downward revision of potential 
growth linked to the fall in investment (
see Box 2 
for an analysis of the balance sheet
s of companies). Conversely, revisions to 
TFP growth would have a 
relatively
 small 
effect on potential growth. This can be explained by the difficulty 
faced by
 the model 
in 
captur
ing
 major shifts that would affect potential: reallocation of resources, 
accelerated development of teleworking, increas
ed spending on 
research and 
development

3 A range of quantitative estimates
 of the impact on potential output
 Prepared by Bela Sz
örfi
 Different 
statistical methods can be used to estimate potential output.
 The methods presented
 in this 
box cover simple statistical filters (Hodrick
-Prescott, Beveridge
-Nelson), a small multivariate filter (a 
survey
-based measure of slack
74), the Blanchard
-Quah 
struct
ural 
vector 
autoregressive 
(SVAR) 
model
 (using an unemployment rate augmented by people under short
-time working schemes), the 
unobserved 
components 
model discussed in detail 
above
, and the Jaroci
ski-Lenza model.
75 The mean of estimates provided by six dif
ferent methods shows potential growth stalling and a 
significantly negative output gap (
see 
Chart A).
 Most
 estimates show lower, but still positive
, potential 
growth in 2020, and as a consequence, a significant negative output gap, 
of 
at least 
-3.5% in 202
0. 
One exception is the Jaroci
ski-Lenza
 model
, which estimates a significant drop in potential output 
and a more stable, albeit negative, output gap.
76 Overall, the quantitative estimates fall in between the two extreme interpretations introduced in 
Sectio
n 1, confirming that euro area potential output has been seriously 
affected
 by COVID
-19, but to 
a lesser
 extent than real GDP.

  60 The uncertainty currently surrounding potential output and output gap estimates is 
at a high level
. The 
range of estimates introd
uced here becomes extremely wide in the second quarter
 of 2020: the 
average width of the range of potential growth is about 2
 percentage points
, increasing to about 5
-7 percentage points
 during the 
great financial crisis
, and to 16
 percentage points
 in the
 second quarter 
of 2020. The range declines beyond the second quarter of 2020 mostly because two of the 
six
 measures (the Jaroci
ski-Lenza model and the survey
-based measure of slack) 
do not use forecast 
data and therefore 
are not available 
between 
the thi
rd quarter of 2020
 and the final quarter of 2022
. However, the large drop in the output gap may reflect an overestimation of the downward pressures on 
inflation. This reflects important government support measures for firms and households. Disposable 
income of households fell less than GDP in the first half of 2020, and thus the cyclical component of 
disposable income might be less negative than the output gap. As a consequence, the output gap might 
overestimate downward inflationary pressures. Likewis
e, labour market slack measures, such as the 
unemployment gap, defined as the difference between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU, might 
not be the most adequate measure of inflationary pressures on wages either. Owing to short
-time 
working schemes, the
 headline unemployment rate has increased less than the business cycle would 
have suggested. As a result, the unemployment gap may understate downward wage pressures.

 The impact of COVID
-19 on potential output in the euro area
  61 6 Conclusions
 The 
COV
ID
-19 pandemic and related containment measures affect the 
industries and countries of the euro area to an extent that is likely to affect 
potential output.
 However, the scale of this impact over the short and long term is 
highly uncertain
. For the short t
erm, the amplitude of the fluctuation depends 
significantly on how containment measures are assumed to affect potential output. In 
the long run, it depends on how long the pandemic will last and the extent to which 
policy measures are able to protect the e
conomy from excessive scarring, among 
other factors.
 The current crisis is likely to induce some structural change
s in the euro area 
economy and economic policies 
will 
play a 
pivotal 
role in facilitating this 
change.
 In particular
, they have an important r
ole
 in 
protecting
 the firms and 
employees of shrinking industries from hysteresis.
 Thus far, 
ECB analysis shows that 
the rapid implementation of short
-time working schemes across European countries 
has mitigated the potential permanent employment losses re
sulting from lo
ckdowns
.77 State
-backed loans have also 
been key to
 facilitating
 firms™
 access to liquidity to cover 
working capital shortfalls
. Such measures are crucial to protect the euro area 
economy from long
-term scarring.

  62 2 European financial 
integration during the COVID
-19 crisis
 Prepared by Stefano Borgioli, Carl
-Wolfram Horn, Urszula Kochanska, 
Philippe Molitor and Francesco Paolo Mongelli
 This article provide
s a
n overview
 of financial fragmentation during the
 coronavirus
 (COVID
-19) crisis a
nd the policies enacted to counter its effects. 
It does 
so through the 
lens of a 
set
 of high
-frequency indicators 
for monitor
ing
 developments in financial 
integration. 
The readings from these 
indicator
s are then linked 
to unfolding economic 
and political e
vents
 and to 
the main policy responses in monetary, fiscal and financial 
stability policy at the national and European levels. After initial 
sharp 
fragmentation, 
euro
 area financial integration broadly recovered to pre
-crisis levels
 by 
mid
-September, but n
ot for all indicators
. However, 
this recovery is still fragile and 
relies on an unprecedented amount of fiscal
, monetary 
and prudential policy 
support
. 1 Introduction
 The 
corona
virus
 (COVID
-19) has created an unprecedented type of shock and 
has caused a sh
arp economic downturn
. In January 2020 the coronavirus started 
to spread
 around 
the globe, including large parts of Europe. On 30 January the World 
Health Organisation
 declare
d COVID
-19 to be 
a public 
health emergency
 of 
international concern and on 11 March upgraded the threat to 
pandemic
 status
. 
As it 
became clear that 
extensive containment measures
 would 
be require
d to control
 the 
spread of the virus, including lockdowns, economic activity in the euro area 
began a 
downturn
 unprecedented 
in 
scale and speed.
 The coronavirus 
is a common health emergency, but it has had differing effects 
across euro area economies.
 The pandemic caused shocks to both supply and 
demand. Supply was constrained by business closures and worke
rs staying at home. 
The halting of retail activities and disruptions in supply chains were then accompanied 
by a plunge in the demand for intermediate and final goods.
78 While the cause of 
these shocks has been common to all countries, the size of the econo
mic fallout has 
differed markedly across countries owing to differences in, among other things, initial 
macroeconomic and financial conditions, the stringency of public health measures and 
the strength of domestic fiscal measures to support the economy, fo
r example
 tax 
deferrals, 
loan guarantee
s, social security payments suspension, export guarantees, 
liquidity assistance and short
-term work schemes.
 The coronavirus 
crisis 
put 
the real economy and 
financial markets under 
extraordinary 
stress
, 
leading to an 
initial sharp fragmentation of euro area 
financial markets
. Within days of the first reported case of coronavirus in Europe on 
                                                                    78  It has been shown that a supply shock affecting sectors asymmetrically can generate a contraction in 
demand larger than the initial shock if the interrelation between sectors is strong enough. See

experienced 
at the start

of the COVID

 European financial integration during the COVID
-19 crisis
  65 The 
rapid 
unfolding of
 the COVID
-19 crisis triggered the need for 
high
-frequency monitoring of financial fragmentation
 developments
 across 
different market segments
. The ECB has monitored the state of financial integration 
in the euro area since the launch of the euro
82 because 
fragmented financial markets 
impede the smooth and uniform transmission of its monetary policy across member 
countries. In order to monitor euro area financial integration at a higher frequency 
during the COVID
-19 crisis, a toolkit of high
-frequency indica
tors was developed 
based on the set
 of indicators presented in 
an ECB 
report on f
inancial 
integration and 
structure in 
the e
uro 
area and its 
statistical 
annex
.83 The technicalities of this 
development are presented in Box 1. These high
-frequency financial integration 
indicators are a useful tool for monitoring financial fragmentation and can also be used 
to illustrate the effects of policy actions in response to t
he economic downturn.
 Euro area policy
 responses to the crisis were decisive at 
both 
the national and 
supranational level
s. This contributed to a rapid 
reversal of financial fragmentation 
towards pre
-crisis levels by mid
-September 2020.
 The ECB™s p
rompt mo
netary policy 
and supervisory actions provided a first line of defence
 to soften the disinflationary 
shock and counteract the adverse effects of financial fragmentation on the 
effectiveness of its monetary policy 
(see 
the top part of 
Chart 2
 for
 an overvie
w).
 These 
responses have taken the form of additional asset purchases through the asset 
purchase programme (APP) and the new pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(PEPP), bank lending programmes at highly favourable conditions (targeted 
longer
-term refinan
cing operations), supervisory measures and coordinated liquidity 
provision programmes. 
National fiscal polic
ymakers
 also reacted immediately 
throughout the euro area, 
even in fiscally constrained countries, 
although the size of 
fiscal pac
kages varied acros
s countries. In addition, recognising the importance of a 
centralised crisis response, over the course of the crisis 
European policymakers have
 established a variety of pan
-European support measures, such as the three safety 
nets 
Œ the temporary SURE schem
e (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an 
Emergency), a loan guarantee scheme by the European Investment Bank (EIB), a 
new credit line from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) 
Œ, the Next Generation 
EU fund and the reinforcement of the 2021
-2027 M
ultiannual Financial Framework 
(MFF)
 (see Chart 2
 for an overview o
f the
 European monetary, supervisory
 and fiscal 
measures taken
). National fiscal measures, which were deployed very rapidly, are not 
included in this chart.
 These policies, together with th
e higher degree of 
resilience 
in 
financial integration achieved through 
the 
institutional 
reforms of the last 
ten
 years
, 
have helped to reverse much of the initial sharp fragmentation of financial markets. 
Financial integration has broadly returned to its 
pre
-crisis levels as of mid
-September. 
This apparent return to the situation before the COVID
-19 outbreak, however, is fragile 
and relies heavily on continued policy support.
                                                                     82  For the ECB, the market for a given set of financial instruments and/or servic
es is fully integrated if all 
potential market participants 
share
 the 
following
 relevant characteristics: (1) 
they 
face a single set of 
rules when they decide to 
make 
transact
ions 
in those financial instruments and/or services; (2) 
they 
have 
equal access to the above
-mentioned set of financial instruments and/or services; and (3) 
they 
are 
treated equally when they are active in the market
. For further reference, see

 The price
-based composite indicator of financial integration and its 
subcomponents
 suggest that 
the corona
virus
 crisis 
has, broad
ly speaking, 
unfolded in four phases.
 Section 2 describes the developments in financial 
integration during each of these four phases (see Chart 1 above and Box 1). 
Phase 1, 
from 30 January 
to
 25 March
 2020, span
ned the outbreak of the crisis 
and the 
announcement of the PEPP. Phase 2
, from 26 March 
to 
7 May
, saw increas
ing 
economic damage and 
initial uncertainty regarding a p
an-European fiscal response. 
Phase 3, from 8 May 
to 
21 July, span
ned the gradual relaxation of lockdowns and the 
progress
 made
 towards 
a common European fiscal response
 and the Next Generation 
EU decision. 
Phase 4, from 22 July 
to
 15 September (
the
 cut
-off 
point 
for
 th
is analysis), 
was a period primarily of maintaining the re
-integration achieved through the 
European monetary and fiscal 
policy responses during the previous phases.

  67 classes and usually have a lower frequency of observation
. Second, many of 
our 
indicator
s do not control for fundamentals, including firm or country risks. 
Similarly, 
particularly in crisis situations, financial markets 
might 
act upon forward
-looking 
expectations
 and significantly 
overreact to news signalling changes in fundamentals
: 
such
 cha
nges in general risk attitudes in mar
kets are also not accounted for in this 
article
. Third, the analysis of causal relationships, or counterfactuals, is beyond the 
scope of this article. 
Thus, the
 article offers only 
a partial perspective
 of the events 
which have unfolded during the coronavirus crisis; a
 more complete assessment of the 
state of financial integration
 and structural developments in the euro area financial 
system would require additional analysis
. Despite these limitations, the analysis of the 
high
-frequency indicators in this article provides useful insights into the development 
of euro area financial integration during this period.
 Box 1
  High
-frequency financial integration indicators within a r
eal-time monitoring toolkit
 Prepared by
 Urszula Kochanska
, Eva Mulder and Alessandro Zito
 Analysing the impact of the coronavirus (COVID
-19) crisis on financial integration requires an agile 
and comprehensive real
-time monitoring toolkit. The aim of this b
ox is therefore to describe the 
development of the high
-frequency price
-based financial integration indicator and to introduce the 
high
-frequency monitoring toolkit.
 To develop such a toolkit, the available financial integration indicators were reviewed to
 identify those 
which could be updated at a sufficiently high frequency. 
From the large set of indicators from the 
ECB™s report on 
financial integration and structure in the euro area
84 and its Statistical annex
85 a subset was selected focusing on the covera
ge of the most relevant financial market segments. Most 
of the selected indicators relate to the price
-based dimension of financial integration, given their 
instant reaction to incoming news. However, a few quantity
-based indicators were also included.
 The
 law of one price, which implies that assets 
that are similar
 in terms of risk and return should have 
the same price, is a cornerstone of price
-based financial integration. Against
 this background
, the 
monthly 
price
-based composite indicator of financial i
ntegration
 developed by Hoffmann et al.
86 measures such integration by examining cross
-country dispersion of returns in four market segments, 
namely 
the 
money
 market (MM)
, bond
 market (BM)
, equity
 market (EM)
 and banking market. Many 
other indicators of fin
ancial integration focus on a specific market segment, 
but this 
indicator offers a 
synthetic and unique measure by merging 
data
 from
 different financial market segments.
 However, 
it 
does not account for different risks across countries. In addition, 
the mo
nthly 
observation 
frequency of 
the price
-based
 composite
 indicator pose
d a challenge 
with regard to
 timely analysis of financial 
integration. 
Owing
 to the lag in data availability 
and the small number of observations in each year, it 
is difficult to link trends in financial integration to certain events
 using this 
indicator. For this reason, 
developing a higher
-frequency version of the price
-based composite indicator appears useful.
                                                                     84  See

 European f
inancial integration during the COVID
-19 crisis
  68 For the 
money
, bond and banking markets, dispersion is calculated by taking the cross
-country 
standard deviation of interest rates, while for the equity market segment two other indicators are 
calculated
, namely EM1 and EM2. EM1, developed by Bekaert et al.,
87 draws 
on the idea that the 
earning
s yields of the same industries should be similar across countries in a well
-integrated market. 
EM2, based on the work of Adjaouté
 and Danthine
,88 points to the convergence of the country and 
sector 
effects in equity port
folios
 in financially integrated markets, where investors have the ability to 
diversify their equity portfolios optimally. 
Higher
-frequency input data are available for all market 
segments except the banking market.
 Daily data can be used for 
the 
money
 and bond markets
 and for 
a sub
-index
 (EM2)
 of the equity market component. 
Data for t
he other sub
-index of the equity market
 (EM1)
 is available
 weekly, while the banking markets 
data 
will have to 
be calculated
 on a monthly 
basis.
 The high
-frequency price
-base
d composite indicator is constructed 
with a view to achieving the 
greatest possible congruence between 
high
-frequency and low
-frequency
 data. 
The input measures 
have been treated 
according
 to the monthly methodological transformations 
used by
 Hoffmann et 
al.89 Instead of monthly data, daily data are used for BM and EM2 and weekly data are used for EM1, 
while for MM a 1
-month trailing daily average is used. A f
urther step 
for
 EM2 involves the 
recursive 
application of the Hodrick
-Prescott filter on
 a series co
nsisting of past monthly observations 
complemented with the latest daily observations. This allows the derivation of a smoothed daily EM2 
value.
 The high
-frequency input measures are further transformed in order to combine
 them
 into a 
composite indicator
, once again 
following
 the procedures used for the monthly composite
 indicator
. 
However, 
this means that 
historical monthly cumulative
 distribution functions are used
 for the 
evaluation of the daily input measures
. The procedure for calculating the monthly composite involves 
normalisation based on the input measures™ empirical cumulative distribution function, adjusting 
wherever necessary 
for the direction so that a higher value would indicate a higher level of fin
ancial 
integration, and finally scaling the measures for benchmarking to an unobserved state of perfect 
integration.
 Using the monthly 
cumulative distribution function
 for 
a full history, the high
-frequency 
indicators are calculated for the period since th
e beginning of 2020 by mapping them onto the 
corresponding 
distributions
 of the 
lower
-frequency 
indicators
. Along with the banking market 
indicator, the t
ransformed input measures constitute the sub
components
 of the 
high
-frequency 
composite indicator for t
he selected financial market segment
s (see 
Chart A).

 European financial integration during the COVID
-19 crisis
  72 Following the outbreak of the coronavirus, initial ﬁalarm
-bellsﬂ were sounded 
by the CISS
 (see Chart 1). Over the course of February the coronavirus spread 
rapidly throughout the euro area and on 17 February the 
Eurogroup finance ministers 
listed the coronavirus outbreak as a 
new downside risk to economic growth. The first 
major local lockdown occurred in 
the Lombardy 
region in Italy on 23 February
. 
A national lockdown followed on 9 March. Strict containment measures were also 
enacted in other euro area countries in the ensuing weeks.
95 The rapid spread of the coronavirus and the ensuing containment measures in 
the first quarter of 2020 had a strong impa
ct on financial markets, leading to 
sharp fragmentation.
 Signs of financial
 fragmentation
 in the euro area emerged in 
February and gained pace in early March. The CISS for the euro area increased 
sharply to levels last seen during the GFC and the euro area
 SDC (see Chart 1). 
Thereafter, the p
rice
-based composite indicator 
of 
financial integration signalled 
rising 
fragmentation in the euro area during
 this initial phase, with bond markets being the 
most
 affected
 segment
 (see the dashboard in Chart 3)
. Betwee
n the end of January 
and mid
-March, the p
rice
-based composite indicator 
fell by roughly 25%. This 
constituted the fourth
-largest decline in this indicator since the introduction of the euro. 
This strong negative correlation between systemic risk and financ
ial integration was 
also observed during the GFC and SDC.

pre
-existing differences in fiscal space.
 At the same time, 
the global financial system 
was put under extraordinary strain, and stress in the operation of debt markets 
resurfaced. There was an 
abrupt r
ebalancing of portfolios in the direction of greater 
liquidity and lower leverage.
 This 
stoked 
the risk
s of forced fire sales in many asset 
markets, 
as well as 
illiquidity spirals and market freezes.
96 In order to 
limit self
-fulfilling 
overshooting dynamics
 and the associated risks to financial stability
, central banks 
initiated new types of 
liquidity provision
s and asset purchases
. These policy measures 
are discussed in more detail below. The divergence in sovereign spreads could be 
seen at both short and l
ong maturities (see Chart 4) and was driven by more 
vulnerable member countries with less fiscal space. For 10
-year sovereign spreads, 
the increase was most notable for Italy, which saw its spread rise from 132 basis points 
on 17 February to 281 basis poin
ts on 17 March. In terms of levels, however, 
sovereign spreads stayed well below the peaks of the SDC in 2011
-12. In the earliest 
stages of the crisis, spread dynamics were consistent with flight
-to
-quality capital flows 
into German safe assets,
 which push
ed German yields 
down further 
(see
 Chart 5

 At the beginning of the 
COVID
-19 crisis
, corporate bond markets showed 
dynamics similar to 
those of 
their sovereign counterpart
s. Both financial and 
non-financial corporate bond yields across major euro area countries more
 than 
quadrupled between mid
-February and mid
-March (see Chart 6). While the uniform 
increase in corporate bond yields suggests that the pandemic and the resulting 
containment measures were a common risk to the viability of all euro area firms, the 
same ti
me period also witnessed significant divergence in yields, with the standard 
deviation of financial and non
-financial corporate bond yields increasing nearly 
fourfold and threefold respectively between 18 February and 23 March. In particular, 
the diverging
 corporate bond yields of Italian financial corporations were consistent 
with a re
-emergence of the sovereign
-bank nexus.
 There was also a
 sovereign
-insurance 
companies and 
pension 
funds 
nexus
, but 
this 
is not discussed 
here.

 The ECB announced a 
comprehensive set of measures between mid
-March and 
end
-March.
 Their aim was to 
stabilis
e markets
, protect the supply of 
credit
 to the 
economy and 
neutralis
e disin
flationary developments 
stemming from the p
andemic
 (see Chart 2)
. These included 
temporary capital and operational relief 
for banks, 
lending to European banks at negative interest rates, and the PEPP,
97 which made 
•750 billion 
available for security purchas
es by the end of 2020 (see Chart 2). T
he PEPP represents a temporary and flexible 
asset purchase programme of private and 
public sector securities
 to counter financial fragmentation and help stabili
se the euro
 area economy in order to ensure 
the
 smooth tra
nsmiss
ion of monetary policy across 
countries.
 These measures helped to halt and partially reverse the divergence of bond 
yields in both the corporate and the sovereign bond markets.
98 Despite the market tensions, the improvements in euro area governance 
and 
institutional infrastructure since the GFC helped to limit fragmentation.
 A legacy 
of the GFC and euro area SDC 
has been the
 overhaul of euro area governance and 
institutional infrastructure with the launch of the ESM and
, some years later
, the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)
, among other
 things
. 
During the COVID
-19 crisis, in its 
capacity as
 single supervisor
, 
the ECB 
was able 
to act in a 
swift and 
coordinated 
manner with respect to banks. 
The new institutional architecture introduced following 
the 
GFC and SDC helped to contain fragmentation. In fact, e
ven during 
the extreme 
market volatility seen at 
the peak of the crisis 
during
 Phase 1 
and before
 the PEPP 
                                                                    97  The legal documentation for the PEPP was published on 25 March 2020.

 European financial integration during the COVID
-19 crisis
  77 announcement, fragmentation increased much less dramatically than during the GFC 
and SDC 
from
 2008 to 
2012.  Phase 2: Increasing economic damage and uncertainty regarding 
the European fiscal response
 The second 
phase 
of the crisis spanned the period from 
26 March 
to
 7 May 2020
. This 
phase was characterised by extensive 
economic 
and financial 
damage
 and the initial 
challenges 
of formulating
 a common European fiscal response
 to add to national fiscal 
initiatives
.99 In this phase, the pandemic had 
uneven effects across financial market 
segments
. The data from the subcomponents of the price
-based composi
te indicator 
suggest that equity markets were the only market segment for which financial 
integration rebounded during the second phase, as it continued to recede in other 
market segments (see Chart 8). This re
-integration occurred across both more and 
les
s liquid equity markets (see Chart 7, left panel) and illustrates the apparent 
ﬁdisconnectﬂ between real 
economic developments (the outlook was worsening 
rapidly according to macro and survey data) and equity market performance during 
the crisis.
100 However, the dispersion and volatility of forecast equity index returns 
remained heightened throughout Phases 2 and 3, especially across sectors. This is 
consistent with the development of equity market volatility. Option
-implied equity 
market volatility 
rose sharply during the first phase of the crisis to levels last seen at 
the height of the GFC. It has since receded, but remains above its levels prior to the 
COVID
-19 crisis. Cross
-country and sectoral dispersion in euro area equity returns 
both rose, ye
t reassuringly the former remains below the latter, signalling that 
companies have continued to benefit from sectoral and geographic diversification 
even during the crisis 
(see 
Chart 7
, 
right
 panel)
                                                                     99  This phase was marked by a continuous s
harp
 increase 
in new cases, with the U
nited 
States
 showing the 
highest 
rate of 
growth, while euro area countries started showing signs of improvement. In the following 
weeks, new confirmed infections started 
to decline
 in advanced economies, but continu
ed to rise in 
emerging market economies.

 The different evolutions of equity and sovereign bond markets, furthermore, 
suggest some degree of ﬁdisconnectﬂ between equity and f
ixed income 
markets throughout this phase of the crisis.
 While equity market integration 
improved in Phase 2, sovereign bond markets 
in particular 
lost much of the integration 
impetus obtained from the PEPP. The levels and cross
-country dispersion of 
sover
eign bond spreads increased sharply. These dynamics came to a halt only 
following the ECB™s decision 
on 22 April 
to ﬁfreezeﬂ sovereign ratings for its 
collateralised lending operations and the fourth European Council meeting, which led 
to the agreement of 
a first common European fiscal package, consisting of three 
safety nets: the ESM, EIB, and SURE funds.
 The agreement on the •540 billion safety net marked a 
breakthrough 
for the 
pan
-European fiscal response to the COVID
-19 crisis
. The agreement on a 
three
-pronged safety net during the fourth dedicated European Council meeting on 23 
April was a major step in the formulation of a common European fiscal response. 
This 
safety net comprises the 
•100 billion 
SURE
 instrument, a 
•200 billion pan
-European 
guarantee fund for loans to companies by the EIB and a 
•240 billion pandemic crisis 
support 
credit line 
by the ESM. 
Furthermore, d
uring this meeting the European 
Council tasked the European Commission 
with
 develop
ing
 a proposal for
 a European 
crisis 
recovery 
fund, 
even though
 diverse views remained regarding the 
make
-up of 
such a fund in terms of the distribu
tion of grants and loans. In retrospect, the policy 
discussion
s that took place at the earlier European Council
 meetings on th
is topic
 were necessary 
for reach
ing
 consensus on the above safety nets and ultimately 
to 
agree on the Next Generation EU
 fund
, which had m
any of the desir
ed effect
s on financial integration.

 European financial integration during the COVID
-19 crisis
  79 The
se positive signs 
of progress 
towards a common European fisca
l response 
to the pandemic 
supported market confidence and 
marked a turning point in 
overall financial 
integration (see Chart 1).
 They revived 
the re
-integration 
trend in 
sovereign and corporate bond markets set in motion by t
he PEPP and other monetary 
and financial stability measures 
(see Chart 2). Other measures that have contributed 
to this re
-integration of financial markets were the ECB™s decision 
on 22 April 
to 
ﬁfreezeﬂ ratings for
 its collateral
ised lending operations, i.e. to uphold
 the
 eligibility 
of 
marketable assets that fulfilled minimum credit quality requirements in
 the event of a 
deterioration in credit ratings
.101 Phase 3: Relaxation of lockdowns and
 the
 Next Generation EU 
fund
 The third 
phase 
of the crisis spanned the period from 8 May to
 21 July
 2020. This 
phase was characterised by a gradual relaxation of lockdowns and the agreement on 
the Next Generation EU fund.
102 The third phase of the crisis 
saw
 several 
events that s
upport
ed financial 
integration
. These events include the Franco
-German an
d European Commission 
proposals 
for an EU Recovery Fund, a gradual relaxation of lockdowns, a 
larger
-than
-expected 
•600 billion expansion of the PEPP purchase envelope and 
eventual agreement on the Next Generation EU recovery fund. The subcomponents of 
the
 price
-based composite indicator point to positive financial integration 
developments across markets during this phase (see Chart 9).
                                                                     101  For furth

 102  During this phase, global C
OVID
-19 infections 
carried 
on rising with no signs of stabilisation
. Daily new 
global 
cases 
rose
 to over 200,000 in mid
-July, more than do
uble the number at which they had 
temporarily stabilised
 in 
April
. At the end of 
July
 the total number of C
OVID
-19 cases 
topped
 17
 million. 
Different 
underlying dynamics were driving these developments, with emerging market economies 
affected by a 
constantly rising number of cases. However, at the end of th
is period
, advanced economies 
including the euro area 
also 
experienced a resurgence of C
OVID

 Financial integration improved across market segments against the 
background of a mixed data flow.
 On the one hand, new data during this phase 
showed 
declining C
OVI
D-19 infections
 and slowing death rates
, which led to the 
gradual 
relaxation of 
European 
containment measures
. On the other hand, data show 
historically negative
 economic
 growth and downward forecast revisions
. In this 
environment, 
the Franco
-German proposal on 18 May for a 
•500 billion fund of grants 
and the European Commission™s Next Generation EU proposal on 27 May 
for 
•750 billion of grants and loans (both funded through the EU budget) led to sizeable 
reductions and some material reconvergence of sovereign spreads and cor
porate 
yields, notably for vulnerable countries
 (see Charts 4, 5 and 6)
. 
These positive 
developments were further reinforced by the decision of the ECB™s Governing Council 
on 4 June to 
increase the size of the PEPP by 
•600 billion 
(to a total 
of •1,350 bil
lion) 
and to extend the 
program
me™s
 reinvestment period 
at least until the end of 2022.
 The joint European fiscal response is a 
milestone 
which 
reinforc
es financial 
integration.
 The calming effects of the
se proposals 
in underpinning the 
European 
recovery (
along with 
other parallel factors) are also 
reflecte
d in euro area corporate 
bond yields
, though with some delay for
 non-financial corporate bond yields

 European financial integration during the COVID
-19 crisis
  81 relative to the 
countries™ 
respective economies 
 may explain some of the bond yield 
and fragmentation developments.
103 The end of this phase was marked by the agreement on the EU Recovery and 
Resilience Facility 
Œ under the Next Generation EU fund proposal 
Œ and the 
2021-27 MFF.
 The agreement resolved par
t of the uncertainty around a common 
European fiscal response
104 and had an immediate positive effect on financial 
integration across a broad set of markets, most notably sovereign and corporate bond 
markets. It thus reinforced the positive integration devel
opments following the 
Franco
-German and European Commission proposals in May.
 There was less f
ragmentation 
in
 money markets than in other financial market 
segments.
 While money markets had been exhibiting some
 signs of 
fragmentation
 since the start of Phas
e 1 and well into Phase 2 
 albeit to a lesser degree than other 
markets 
 indicators for the money market segment started falling to lower dispersion 
levels in late April 2020 (see the left panel of Chart 10). The different lending 
operations and the adju
stments to lending criteria and eligible collateral supported a 
gradual reduction of dispersion, in particular for 
unsecured money market rates 
such

The dispersion of secured money market rates spiked
 around key dates

 on account of flight

around futures
 delivery 
dates owing to 
collateral scarcity. 
In early May 2020 it again
 approached 
pre

, France has the largest (and most developed) corporate bond
 market of 
all euro area countries, followed by Germany, Italy and Spain. 
As a share of GDP
, however, 
the German 
market is smaller than the French, Italian, Dutch or even Spanish market
s. The main reason 
for this 
is 
that the segment for non
-financial corpo
rations is less developed 
in Germany 
than in France or the 
Netherlands, as German companies still rely more on bank loans. A
long with 
the changing risk 
environments for
 companies in the different countries over time, this may explain why German 
non

al corporate yields are sometimes the highest among all the countries covered in

 The
 broad
-based improvement in financi
al integration 
continued during this 
phase
. The data from the price
-based composite indicator and its subcomponents 
suggest that throughout this phase of the crisis, the agreement on the EU Recovery 
Fund and the MFF continued to have a positive impact on t
he level of financial 
integration. Indeed, the composite indicator recovered to its pre
-crisis levels at the end 
of August (see Chart 1). The continuing 
re-integration trend in European financial 
markets
 is also
 illustrat
ed, for instance, 
by the decline 
in the level and dispersion of 
10-year sovereign spreads 
throughout the fourth phase of the crisis (see Chart 5)
. 
Furthermore, the corporate bond market showed a continued downward trend towards 
levels last observed in March 2020, driven also by low primary 
market activity and 
relatively low market liquidity over the summer period.
 The current stabilisation and apparent return to the 
situation before the 
COVID
-19 outbreak
, however, calls for several qualifications.
 The return of 
financial integration measures
 to
wards
 pre
-crisis levels has to be seen against the 
background of the 
substantial amount of
 monetary and fiscal stimul
us 
on which it 
relies and which 
is essential for its sustainability.
 Although some of the uncertainty has 
been resolved following the ag
reement on a European recovery instrument, 
substantial uncertainty about the post
-crisis economic recovery remains, in particular 
in view of a renewed increase in infection rates across European countries, which 
raises the possibility of a new round of loc
kdown measures, and the pending 
ratification of the Next Generation EU fund in national parliaments.

 European financial integration during the COVID
-19 crisis
  84 3 Conclusion
 This article has presented a 
set of high
-frequency indicators to monitor 
developments in financial integration during the COVID
-19 crisis.
 The article 
focuses on a 
price
-based 
composite 
indicator 
of 
financial integration 
and its 
subcomponents for 
the 
money, bond, equity and banking markets
. An original 
contribution of this article is to transform them 
Œ with the support of big data techn
iques
 Œ so that they give
 higher
-frequency 
observations
. The 
high
-frequency
 monitoring 
toolkit 
presented here
 is based on analysis conducted at the ECB and in the 
Eurosystem. It 
includes new
 high
-frequency indicators
 for 
the 
money market along
 with
 various indi
cators track
ing
 sovereign and corporate bond markets.
 This toolkit is 
flexible and can be expanded over time.
 The 
data from
 the
se high
-frequency 
financial 
indicators 
can be used to track 
the unfolding of the 
COVID
-19 crisis and interpret the effects of 
monetary, fiscal 
and financial policy responses
 from the viewpoint of euro area financial 
integration
. The indicators suggest that the most 
significant challenge for the 
resilience of financial integration in the euro area
 came in the initial phases of the
 COVID
-19 crisis. The onset of the crisis was especially 
sever
e in terms of 
fragmentation development
s, especially prior to the PEPP announcement. Thereafter, 
sustained signs of financial re
-integration emerged as progress was made on a joint 
European fisc
al response, highlighting the powerful effects of monetary and fiscal 
policy coordination in weathering economic crises.
 A nuanced picture emerges when cross
-checking the price
-based composite 
indicator of 
financial integration
 against the segment
-specific
 indicators.
 The 
composite indicator of financial integration
 shows
 a trough in mid
-April 2020 
Œ but by 
mid
-August 2020 surpasse
s the levels seen prior to the coronavirus
 crisis.
 However, 
such 
re-integration is n
ot observed in
 all market segments
; nor do a
ll euro area 
countries benefit from it to the same degree.
 Money markets have been a strong 
contributor to the 
rebound of
 price
-based financial integration 
to early 2020 levels
. 
For 
both sovereign and corporate bond markets
, the
 re-integration trend 
stabil
ised as late 
as August 2020
, and integration only returned to pre
-crisis
 levels towards the end of 
the reporting period. Equity market integration displays diverging paths across 
countries and has picked up slightly compared 
with
 early July 2020
, but 
remai
ns 
around pre
-crisis levels.
 At present, the
 re-integration of euro area financial markets is still 
fragile 
and 
uneven, 
and the gradual return to the 
situation
 before the COVID
-19 outbreak 
relies 
on the unprecedented amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus 
in place.
 While many indicators of financial integration show an improvement throughout the 
third and fourth phases of the crisis, this re
-integration
 trend is 
subject to 
the risk of 
further
 wave
s of infections
 and renewed lockdown measures.

 1 Introduction
 and
 relevance
 of pension
 funds
 Pension
 funds
 play
 an important
 role
 in the
 euro
 area
 economy.
 They
 provide
 an opportunity
 for
 households
 to
 save
 for
 retirement
 and, at the
 same
 time,
 help
 the
 efficient
 allocation
 of long
-term
 capital.
 Pension
-related
 assets
 are
 typically
 one of the
 main
 assets
 of households
 (representing
 around
 20% of euro
 area
 households™
 net financial
 wealth),
 particularly
 in countries
 where
 occupational
 pensions
 are
 prevalent
. The
 new
 pension
 fund
106 statistics
 combine
 data
 on the
 different
 pension
 schemes
 in
 euro
 area
 countries
 in
 one harmonised
 set
 of statistics.
 They
 offer
 a much
 enhanced
 set
 of information,
 essential
 for
 monitoring
 the
 development
 of pension
 funds
 from
 the
 perspective
 of monetary
 policy,
 financial
 stability
 and financial
 structures.
 Pension
 schemes
 that
 are
 provided
 through
 governments
 (e.g.
 social
 security
 schemes
107) and pension
 plans
 offered
 by insurance
 corporations
 are
 excluded
 from
 the
 scope
 of the
 Regulation.
 The first reporting of pension fund 
statistics from national central banks to the ECB in line with the Regulation beg
an with 
quarterly data on assets 
and liabilities 
for the 
third qua
rter of 2019 and with
 annual 
data on number of pension scheme members for 2019. The first 
public 
release of the 
pension funds 
dataset took place on 31 
July 2020
 on the 
ECB™s 
Statistical Data 
Warehouse (SDW)
108 platform
. Pension
 funds
 have
 grown
 substantially
 in
 the
 euro
 area
 over
 the
 past
 two
 decades
 in terms
 of their
 financial
 assets
 and
 as a percentage
 of GDP.
 Euro
 area
 pension
 fund
 assets
 have
 almost
 doubled
 in size
 since
 2008,
 with
 total
 assets
 currently
 amounting
 to
 approximately
 •3 trillion
 and almost
 doubling
 their
 percentage
 relative
 to
 euro
 area
 GDP
 from
 13% in 2008 to
 25%
 in 2019 (see
 Chart
 1).
 By comparison,
 according
 to
 OECD
 data,
 the
 value
 of US private
 pension
 fund
 assets
 was
 equivalent
 to
 around
 140% of GDP
 in 2018.109                                                                     106  Autonomous pension funds, as defined by the European System of National and Regional Accounts 
(ESA 2010
). Pension funds consist only of t
hose pension funds that are institutional units separate from 
the units that create them
; non-autonomous pension funds set up, for example, by credit institutions or 
non
-financial corporations are
 therefore
 not covered
. Individual pension plans offered by 
insurance 
corporations or other institutions
 are
 also excluded from the scope of the 
Regulation
, as are
 social 
security schemes.

In contrast to social insur

 In

117 schemes represent more than 85% of total pension

years from defined benefit to defined contribution contracts,
118 although the impact on 
the outstanding amounts will not be 
seen until after a few years of accumulation (see 
Chart 5).

the
 benefit on retirement
 is predetermined by a formula based on 
the earnings history
, working life and age
 of the individual. 
The benefit at retirement does not depend 
directly on investment re
turns, as it is fixed in advance. By contrast
, in defined contribution schemes, 
individual accounts are set up for participants and benefits are based on the amounts credited to these 
accounts plus any investment earnings. In such plans, future benefits fl
uctuate on the basis of investment 
earnings
, and sponsors (which are typically employers) do not have any obligation to make further 
contributions to the plan if it evolves unfavourably
; this is explained 
in 
more detail 
by way of
 the new 
statistics available in Section 3. Hybrid plans include
 both
 defined benefit and defined contribution 
components.

 New pension fund statistics
  91 on the
 economy
 and the
 financial
 sector.
 A few examples of the use of the new 
pension fund statistics are detailed in Section 3.
 The
 Regulation
 covers 
autonomous
 pension
 funds,
 as defined
 by the
 European
 System
 of National
 and
 Regional
 Accounts
 (ESA 2010)122. Pension
 funds
 are
 financial
 corporations
 that
 are
 mainly
 engaged in financial
 intermediation
 as a consequence
 of the
 pooling
 of the
 social
 risks
 and needs of their
 members
 and beneficiaries.
 About 76% of total pension entitlements are pension fund liabilities
123 according to the euro area accounts (see Chart 6). Insurance corporations may also 
offer saving schemes, which are recorded as pensions, in particular if participation in 
such a scheme is part of an employment contract. The 
liabilities
 of insurance 
corpor
ations make up 9% 
of total 
pension
 entitlements

. Note: ﬁNon
-autonomous pension fundsﬂ cover non
-financial 
corporations, monetary financial institutions, other financial institutions, 
general government and households and non
-profit institutions serving households.
 Only
 those
 pension
 funds
 that
 are
 institutional
 units
 separate
 from
 the
 units
 that
 create
 them
 are included
 in
 pension
 fund
 statistics.
 In some countries 
employers can create pensions schemes for their employees without involving a 
pension fund or insurance corporation. These non
-autonomous schemes are not 
included in pension fund statistics
. Where pe
nsion commitments are recognised on 
the balance sheet of the employers, they are covered in the euro area accounts. 
Non
-autonomous schemes account for about 14% of total pension entitlements. 
                                                                    122  At the time of the implementation of the Regulation there were no pension funds in France that met the 
ESA 2010 definition.
 123  These pension entitlements are those covered under the second pillar (occupational pensions) and the 
third pillar (e.g. individual pension schemes offered by pension funds) in Figure 1. 
 124  Pension schemes offered by insurance corporations are covered by t
he statistics on insurance 
corporations. Voluntary savings products, e.g. individual life insurance policies and annuities, are not 
considered pension schemes but are recorded under life insurance and annuities in insurance statistics 
and the euro area acc
ounts.

.129 In 2017 the ECB launched a public consultation
130on the draft regulation on 
statistical reporting req

 Key documents 
Œ comprising 
the draft regulation, a summary of the related merits and costs procedure run in 2016, 
and frequently asked questions 
Œ were 
made 
available on the ECB™s website as 
background information. 
The public 
consultation was instrumental in terms of finding 
an appropriate balance between user needs and reporting agents™ costs, and also 
formed the basis for some technical fine

 In addition,
 annual data on pension scheme members, 
broken down into active, deferred and retired members
, are also reported
. Stocks 
refer to the value of t
he asset or liability at the end of the reference quarter or year. 
Revaluation adjustments refer to changes in stocks due to changes in prices or 
exchange rates. Transactions refer to the sum of all net acquisitions (minus sales) of a 
given type of asset d
uring the period, and the net incurrence (inflows minus outflows) 
of liabilities. 
In addition, the split between defined benefit and defined contribution 
schemes can be complemented with the information reported security

 3 New euro area data on pension fund statistics
 Euro area pension funds obtain capital 
from resident members.
 More than 99% 
of pension entitlements, the main liability item, are from the Member State where the 
pension fund
 is located
, showing a strong domestic bias and also pointing to the low 
level of 
cross
-border business 
carried out 
by 
pension funds

ementary data in the analysis of 
the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes where the investment risks are borne by 
the policyholder or beneficiary. While this shift may reduce direct financial risks for pension funds, it 
necessitates i
ncreased monitoring of defined contribution schemes, which may have a significant 
economic impact on the net wealth of households

Regulation,

s report investment fund shares 
they must 
specify 
which type of fund they are investing in (namely equity, bond, mixed, hedge, real 
estate 
or 
other)
 (see Chart 9)
. 
The new reporting
 shows that
 the largest type of 
investment fund share
s held by euro area 
pension fund
s is equity, followed by bond 
funds 
and mixed funds (which c
ombine the previous two types).

Holdings of equity fund shares fell by 15%, while those of bond funds were stable 
throughout the quarter
, with revaluation losses mostly compensated by positive 
transactions

. Net 
worth is the balancing item in the statistical balance sheet
134, and its 
evolution can be better understood with the new data on revaluation 
adjustments.
 In a defined benefit pension scheme, the level of pension benefits 
promised to participating employees i
s defined by a formula agreed in advance. Since 
assets are valued at market prices, their value might be 
higher
 or lower than the 
promised entitlements, leading to 
a positive or negative worth of 
the 
pension fund, 
respectively. When net worth turns negativ
e, a 
pension fund
 can be said to be
 underfunded
.135 Another advantage of the new collection of data is the availability of 
revaluations and reclassifications, which can help explain why net worth grows or falls. 
The n
et worth 
of euro area 
pension fund
s fell 
from 
•124 billion in 
the fourth quarter of 
2019 to 
•-122 billion in 
the first quarter of 
2020. This drop can mostly be explained 
by the newly reported negative revaluations in 
the first quarter of 
2020 (see Chart 1
3), 
mirroring exceptional market developme
nts in this quarter due to the pandemic
.                                                                     134  In a defined contribution scheme the benefits paid are dependent on the performance of t
he assets 
acquired by the pension scheme. The liability of a defined contribution scheme is the current market 
value of the fund
™s assets. The fund
™s net worth is always zero.
 135  The new 
pension fund
 statistics also cover possible financial positions between 
pension fund
s and 
ﬁpension managersﬂ as 
defined by
 ESA 2010. If the employer retains the responsibility for any deficit in 
funding, the 
fund
 may record a claim on the employer. In practice
, fundin
g shortfalls may be addressed by 
increased contributions from employers and employees and/or by adjustments to benefits
, depending on 
national legal provisions.

. 4 Conclusions
 Pension funds play a dual role, helping individuals save for old age and 
allocating long
-term capital efficiently 
across firms, sectors and global 
markets.
 Pension funds are among the largest and fastest
-growing investors in global 
capital markets. 
Their investments are diverse in terms of financial instruments, 
sectors and geographical location
. 
Their role in the fun
ding of euro area governments 
and non
-financial corporations through investments in debt securities and equity is 
also increasing. The effects of the financial
 crisis
 and the 
pandemic, the low interest 
rate environment and Europe™s ageing population have a
ll highlighted the need for 
better quality, more granular and comparable data on this sector. 
Previously, g
aps in 
the data available and the lack of comparability across countries made it difficult to 
gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of the s
ector in the monetary policy 
transmission mechanism, of cash flows and of the risks associated with pension 
obligations, as well as 
the 
risks associated with pension funds™ investment behaviour 
and their interconnectedness with the rest of the financial sy
stem and the real 
economy. 
This is why
 it is crucial to have good
, harmonised statistics on euro area 
pension funds.
 The new euro area statistics on pension funds improve upon the previous 
dataset in several respects.
 The new dataset features (i) harmonise
d concepts that 
comply with international statistical standards and
 ensure
 the dataset is consistent 
with supervisory data; (ii) full coverage of institutions; (iii) detailed breakdowns of 
assets and liabilities, including 
by 
maturit
y, counterpart sector a
nd geographical area; 
(iv) 
data on 
transactions and adjustments (e.g. revaluations and reclassifications); and 
(v) more timely releases of data
. In addition, they are a vital building block
 for the 
compilation 
of data on 
pension funds and households

cial investments in the

1) Where annual and quarterly Labour Force Survey data have not yet been published, annual and quarterly data are derived as simple averages of the monthly data. Owing to technicalissues with the introduction of the new German system of integrated household surveys, including the Labour Force Survey, the figures for the euro area include data from Germany for the
first and second quarters of 2020 which are not direct estimates from Labour Force Survey microdata, but based on a larger sample including data from other integrated household surveys.2) Not seasonally adjusted.
3) The job vacancy rate is equal to the number of job vacancies divided by the sum of the number of occupied posts and the number of job vacancies, expressed as a percentage.Data are non-seasonally adjusted and cover industry, construction and services (excluding households as employers and extra-territorial organisations and bodies).3.5 Short-term business statistics          Industrial productionCon-ECB indicator   Retail salesNew
