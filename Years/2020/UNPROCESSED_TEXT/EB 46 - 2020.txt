  2 Economic and monetary
 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 
10 September 2020
, the Governing Council 
decided
 to keep its accommodative monetary policy stance unchanged
. Incoming 
information
 suggest
s a strong
 Œ though incomplete 
 rebound in activity 
broadly i
n line with previous expectations, although the level of activity remains well 
below the levels prevailing before the coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic. While 
activity in the manufacturing sector has continued to improve, momentum in the 
services sector has 
slowed somewhat recently. The strength of the recovery remains 
surrounded by significant uncertainty, as it continues to be highly dependent on the 
future evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. Euro area 
domestic demand has reco
rded a significant recovery from low levels, although 
elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook continues to weigh on consumer 
spending and business investment. Headline inflation is being dampened by low 
energy prices and weak price pressures in the
 context of subdued demand and 
significant labour market slack.
 Against this background, ample monetary stimulus 
remains necessary to support the economic recovery and to safeguard medium
-term 
price stability. Therefore, 
the Governing Council
 decided to re
confirm 
its
 accommodative monetary policy stance
 at its meeting on 10
 September 2020.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 10
 September 2020
 The coronavirus pandemic remains the 
main
 source of uncertainty for the 
global economy
. After a temporary stabilisation around mid
-May, which led to a 
gradual lifting of containment measures, the number of daily new cases started picking 
up again
 more recently which
 has fuelled fears of a strong 
resurgence in coronavirus 
infections. These fears have been weighing on consumer confidence. Incoming data 
confirm that global economic activity bottomed out in the second quarter and started to 
rebound in line with the gradual lifting of containment measu
res from mid
-May 
onwards. The September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections envisage that 
world real GDP (excluding the euro area) will contract by 3.7% this year and expand by 
6.2% and 3.8% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The contraction in global tr
ade will be 
more severe given both its strong procyclicality, especially during economic 
downturns, and the peculiar nature of the 
coronavirus 
crisis, which has entailed 
disruptions in global production chains and increased trade costs because of the 
conta
inment measures. Risks to the global outlook remain skewed to the downside 
given the persistent uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic, which may leave 
lasting scars on the global economy. Other downside risks relate to the outcome of the 
Brexit n
egotiations, the risk of a rise in trade protectionism, and longer
-term negative 
effects on global supply chains.

 Overview
  3 Although financial conditions in the euro area have loosened somewhat 
further 
since the Governing Council™s meeting in 
June 
2020, they have no
t yet
 returned 
to the levels seen before the 
coronavirus pandemic
. Over the review period (
from 
4 June to 9 September 2020)
, the forward curve of the euro overnight index average 
(EONIA) shifted slightly downwards and, although mildly inverted at the short
 end, 
it 
does not signal firm expectations of an imminent rate cut. 
Long-term euro area 
sovereign bond spreads decreased over the review period amid a combination of 
monetary and fiscal support. Prices of risk
y assets increased somewhat, mainly 
against the
 backdrop of a generally more positive short
-term earnings outlook. In 
foreign exchange markets, the euro appreciated relatively strongly in trade
-weighted 
terms
 and against the US dollar
. Euro area real GDP contracted by 11.8%, quarter on quarter, in the 
second 
quarter of 2020
. Incoming data and survey results indicate a continued recovery of 
the euro area economy and point to a rebound in GDP in the third quarter
 although 
remaining below pre
-crisis levels
. Alongside a significant rebound in industrial and
 services production, there are signs of a 
clear
 recovery in consumption. Recently, 
momentum has slowed in the services sector compared with the manufacturing 
sector, which is also visible in survey results for August. The increases in coronavirus 
infectio
n rates during the summer months constitute headwinds to the short
-term 
outlook. Looking ahead, a further sustained recovery remains highly dependent on the 
evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. While the 
uncertainty related to
 the evolution of the pandemic will likely dampen the strength of 
the recovery in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the euro area 
economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary 
fiscal stance and a strengt
hening in global activity and demand.
 This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area
. These projections foresee annual 
real GDP growth at 
-8.0% in 2020, 5.0% in 2021 and 3.2% in 2022. Compar
ed with the 
June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP 
growth has been revised up for 2020 and is largely unchanged for 2021 and 2022. 
Given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections 
include two alternative scenarios
, a mild one and a severe one, corresponding to 
different assumptions regarding the evolution of the pandemic.
1 Overall, the balance 
of risks to the euro area growth outlook is seen to remain on the downside. This 
assessment largely reflects the still uncertain economic and financial implications of 
the pandemic
. According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation 
decreased to 
-0.2% in August, from 0.4% in July.
 On the basis of current and 
future
s prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German 
VAT rate, headline inflation is likely to remain negative over the coming months before 
turning positive again in early 2021. Moreover, in the near term price pressures will 
rem
ain subdued owing to weak demand, lower wage pressures and the appreciation 
of the euro exchange rate, despite some upward price pressures related to supply 
                                                                 1  See the ﬁ
ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, September 2020

 Overview
  4 constraints. Over the medium term, a recovery in demand, supported by 
accommodative monetary and fi
scal policies, will put upward pressure on inflation. 
Market
-based indicators of longer
-term inflation expectations have returned to their 
pre
-pandemic levels, but still remain very subdued, while survey
-based measures 
remain at low levels.
 This assessment
 is broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual inflation at 
0.3% in 2020, 1.0% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022
. Compared with the June 2020 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ou
tlook for inflation is unchanged for 
2020, has been revised up for 2021, and is unchanged for 2022. The unchanged 
projection for inflation in 2022 masks an upward revision to inflation excluding energy 
and food 
Œ in part reflecting the positive impact of t
he monetary and fiscal policy 
measures 
Œ which was largely offset by the revised path of energy prices.
 Annual 
HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 0.8% in 2020, 0.9% in 2021 
and 1.1% in 2022.
 The 
coronavirus 
pandemic has continued to
 influence significantly monetary 
dynamics in the euro area
. Broad
 money (M3) growth 
continued to rise, reaching 
10.2% in 
July
 2020, 
after 9
.2% in 
June
. The s
trong money growth reflects 
domestic
 credit creation, 
the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosyste
m and precautionary 
considerations which foster a heightened preference for liquidity in the money
-holding 
sector
. The narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of 
money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth.
 Developments in 
loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on 
economic activity. The annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations 
remained broadly stable 
in July, standing at 7.0%, compared with 7.1% in J
une. These 
high rates
 reflect firms™ 
elevated liquidity 
needs to finance their ongoing expenditure
s and working capital 
and to further build liquidity buffers, although the rebound in 
economic activity has resulted in some recovery in their revenues
. The a
nnual growth 
rate of loans to households also remained stable at 3.0% in July
. The Governing 
Council™s
 policy measures, 
together with the measures adopted by national 
governments and European institutions, 
will continue to support access to financing, 
incl
uding for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic
. The coronavirus pandemic continues to have an extraordinarily large impact on 
public finances in the euro area.
 The fiscal cost of 
containment
 measures has been 
very substantial for all euro area countries, although both the burden and the capacity 
to respond vary across countries. As a result of the economic downturn and the 
substantial fiscal support, the general government budget deficit in t
he euro area is 
projected to increase significantly to 8.8% of GDP in 2020, compared with 0.6% in 
2019. The deficit ratio is expected to decline to 4.9% and 3.6% of GDP in 
2021 and 2022, respectively
. The extensive fiscal measures in 2020 have led to a cor
responding 
worsening of the cyclically adjusted primary balance, in addition to a negative cyclical 
component reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic situation. The 
subsequent improvement is expected to be led by the phasing
-out of the emergency 
measures and a 
better 
cyclical situation. 
An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance 
remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy
, although

  5 measures should be targeted and temporary. In this respect, both the •540 billion 
package of three safety nets endorsed by the European Council and the European 
Commission™s 
Next Generation EU package of •750 billion
, which has the potential to 
significantly support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic
, are strongly 
welcomed
. The m
onetary policy package
 To sum up, a cross
-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals 
coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary 
accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation 
to levels that are 
below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
 Against this background, o
n 10 September
 2020, the Governing Council 
reconfirmed the set of accommodative
 monetary policy measures
 in place.
 1. The Governing Council decided to keep the
 key ECB 
interest rates
 unchanged. 
These 
are expected to remain at their present or lower levels until the inflation 
outlook robustly converges to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within 
the projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently
 reflected in 
underlying inflation dynamics.
 2. The Governing Council 
decided to 
continue 
its
 purchases under the pandemic 
emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of •1,350 billion. 
These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary p
olicy stance, 
thereby helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected 
path of inflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner 
over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows 
the 
Govern
ing Council 
to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of 
monetary policy. 
Net asset purchases will 
be conduct
ed under the PEPP until at 
least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges 
that the coronavirus cri
sis phase is over. 
In addition, 
reinvest
ments of
 the 
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP 
will be 
conducted 
until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll
-off of the 
PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid inte
rference with the appropriate 
monetary policy stance.
 3. Net purchases under 
the 
asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a 
monthly pace of •20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional 
•120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. 
The Governing Council 
continue
s to expect monthly net asset purchases
 under the APP to run for as 
long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of 
the ECB™s
 policy 
rates, and to end shortly before 
the Governing Council
 start
s raising the key ECB 
interest rates. 
In addition, the Governing Council
 intend
s to continu
e reinvesting, 
in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP 
for an extended period of time past the date when 
it start
s raising the key ECB 
interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable 
liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

 Overview
  6 4. Finally, the Governing Council
 will also continue to provide ample liquidity 
through 
its 
refinancing operations. In particular, the latest operation in the third 
series of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) has registered 
a very high take
-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households.
 The monetary policy measures that 
the Governing Council
 has taken since early 
March are providing crucial support to under
pin the recovery of the euro area 
economy and to safeguard medium
-term price stability. In particular, they support 
liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to 
households and firms, and contribute to maintaining f
avourable financing conditions 
for all sectors and jurisdictions. At the same time, in the current environment of 
elevated uncertainty, the Governing Council will carefully assess incoming 
information, including developments in the exchange rate, with rega
rd to its 
implications for the medium
-term inflation outlook. 
The Governing Council
 continues 
to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation 
moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment
 to symmetry.

 The 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) pandemic remains the major source of uncertainty for 
the global economy
. Around mid
-May the number of new cases stabilised temporarily, 
which led to a gradual lifting of containment measures. 
However, thereafter the 
numbers picked up again 
Œ especially in the United States, as well as in Brazil and 
other emerging market economies 
Œ until new infections globally started to plateau in 
early August. But the infection rate remains high and numbers 
of new cases are rising 
in Europe and some other regions, fuelling fears of a strong resurgence in coronavirus 
infections
. These fears have been
 weighing negatively on consumer confidence
. Incoming data confirm that 
global 
economic 
activity bottomed out in
 the second 
quarter and started to rebound in line with the gradual lifting of containment measures 
from mid
-May onwards. T
he September
 2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projection
s envisage that 
world real GDP (excluding the euro area) 
will 
contract by 
3.7
% this year
 and expand
 by 6.
2% and 3.
8% in 2021 and 2022
, respectively.
 The contraction in 
global trade will be more
 severe than the fall in real GDP given both its more 
pronounced
 pro
cyclicality
, especially during economic downturns, 
and also the 
distinctiv
e nature of the COVID
-19 crisis
, which has entailed d
isruptions in global 
production chains and increased trade costs 
because
 of the containment measures
. Risks to the global outlook remain skewed to the downside given the persistent 
uncertainty about the 
evolution of the pandemic, which may leave lasting scars on the 
global economy. 
Other 
downside 
risks 
relate 
to the 
outcome of the 
Brexit negotiations
, the 
risk of a rise in trade protectionism
, and, relatedly, longer
-term negative effects on 
global supply 
chains.
 Global economic activity and trade
 The global economy entered a deep, synchronised recession 
in the 
first
 half of 
2020 as a result of the COVID
-19 pandemic
. The 
outbreak and the 
containment 
measures adopted to 
limit
 the spread of the virus weighed 
on economic activity 
causing an unprecedented and synchronised fall in global output
, which reached its 
trough in April 2020
. Global uncertainty soared to levels not seen since the global 
financial crisis. 
Incoming 
national accounts data for the second qua
rter confirm 
a sharp contraction in economic activity. The fall in global trade was even sharper, 
although less pronounced than envisaged 
in the June 2020 
Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections. This 
suggest
s a lower
 global trade elasticity than 
previously assumed. 
At the same time, 
China 
was able to start lifting 
containment 
measures 
around 
late March and 
see its
 economy return to positive growth rates 
already in the second quarter.
 Once
 the 
spread of COVID
-19 starte
d 
to abate and 
containment measures 
started
 to be lifted
, the 
global 
economy began
 to recover, as confirmed by 
survey data
. With
 restrictions 
having been
 eased and production 
having 
started to 
normalise, global economic activity and trade are expected to r
ebound from the low 
levels of the second quarter
. Global composite output Purchasing Managers Indices 
(PMIs; excluding the euro area) have been improving steadily since reaching the 
trough in April (see Chart 1). 
In August, the global composite output PMI 
(excl
uding

  8 the
 euro area) rose for a fourth consecutive month
, up to 52.6 from 50 in July and from 
a low of 28.6 in April. The rebound is broad
-based
 across both the manufacturing and 
service sectors. 
The recovery, however, 
appears uneven across countries.
 Among 
advanced economies, the composite output PMI continued growing in the United 
States and the United Kingdom, while it remained in contractionary territory in Japan. 
Among emerging economies, the composite output PMI increased further in China, 
Russia
 and Brazil but continued to show a contraction in India.

 Note
s: The latest observations are for 
August 2020.
 Global 
financial
 conditions 
have eased significantly in recent months.
 During 
the summer, the recovery in financial markets that had started in late March continued
, with seemingly undiminished momentum across major advanced 
market economies 
and some emerging 
ones. Equity markets rallied to new record levels in the U
nited 
States
 and multi
-year highs in China, and continued to quickly recover the bulk of 
their 
losses elsewhere. Other risky market segments, including corporate bond
s, also 
benefit
ed from the bullish 
market sentiment. With risk
-free sovereign yields broadly 
unchanged at or close to historically low levels, 
indices of 
financial conditions reached 
an all
-time high in advanced economies, and 
were 
not far off record levels in 
emerging 
market economies
. The
 ongoing rally in risky assets was driven by a string of positive 
macro
economic
 data surprises and a further rise in risk appetite, partly reflecting 
increasing
 optimism about
 the early delivery of a vaccine. 
However, financial markets 
remain in alert mode
 as the outlook hinges on the uncertain path of the pandemic. 
Volatility remains well above historical averages and market perceptions of risk remain 
skewed to the downside.
 Global
 real GDP 
(excluding the euro area) 
will
 decline by 
3.7
% this year
. Accordin
g to the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, global real 
GDP growth (excluding the euro area)

second
 half of 2020, a

  9 distancing remain in place 
and an effective medical solution 
only becomes available 
by mid
-2021. 
The projec
tion baseline is therefore compatible with 
infections
 continuing
 in some countries
, while it is assumed that 
renewed outbreaks 
are 
dealt 
with by means of targeted containment measures
 which 
are 
assumed to be 
less 
disruptive of economic activity than 
earlier lockdowns.
 The lingering uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic delivers an 
incomplete economic recovery by the end of the projection horizon.
 The 
COVID
-19 crisis has been
 a triple shock for the global economy
2. Unlike past crises,
 it hit 
private consumption particularly hard in the first half of 2020. Looking ahead, while 
the negative effects of containment measures will likely dissipate and global 
production 
will 
gradually re
cover
, continued uncertainty about the health and 
economic 
outlo
ok will continue to weigh on consumption, thus holding back a more 
vigorous recovery 
in economic activity. Compared to the June 2020 
Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections,
 the trajectory for the level of economic activity is broadly 
unchanged
, remaini
ng below the pre
-COVID
-19 baseline
 projection
 throughout the 
forecast horizon
. Therefore
, world real GDP growth
 (ex
cluding the euro area)
 is 
projected to grow at 
6.2% in 2021 and 3.8% in 2022
. In the United States, 
economic activity is recovering in the th
ird quarter on the 
back of income support measures.
 Real GDP contracted by 31.7% annualised 
(-9.1% quarter on quarter) in the second quarter, according to the second estimate. 
This contraction was slightly smaller than reported in the advance estimate (
-9.5% 
quarter on quarter), reflecting upward revisions to private inventory investment and 
personal consumption expenditures.
 Recent 
data releases for the United States have 
been positive overall
. After large increases in May and June, sales of retail goods a
nd 
food services rose by a modest 1.2% in July
, but 
still
 excee
ded pre
-pandemic levels. 
Total personal consumption expenditure
, however, 
remains 
far
 below its pre
-pandemic 
level
, as spending on 
other 
services has fallen. Household spending ha
d been supported by
 increased unemployment benefits and one
-off direct income support. 
These payments largely 
expired
 in August, leading to a sizeable drop in income which 
could further undermine consumption. As
 lockdown measures were eased around 
May,
 workers
 st
arted to return to their jobs, reversing more 
than half of the temporary 
lay
-offs reported in April
. However, the pace of employment creation slowed in July 
compared to May and June and the unemployment rate still remains at historically 
high levels. 
Annua
l headline 
consumer price index (
CPI
) inflation increased to 1.0% in 
July from 0.6% in June. Core inflation 
rose
 strongly to 1.6% in July from 1.2% in June, 
driven by rising prices for shelter and medical services. Various inflation expectation
s indicators
 have picked up recently, 
approaching
 their 
long
-term averages
 again
. Nonetheless, the outlook for inflation remains very subdued as the economy continues 
to operate below potential.
 In China, the economy is recovering strongly but retail sales remain weak
. China™s GDP increased in the second quarter by 11.5%
 quarter on quarter
, returning to 
above 
its 
level
 at the end of 2019
. Investment was the largest driver of growth, 
                                                                 2  The initial supply shock, induced by the 
introduction of lockdown measures in most parts of the world, 
was simultaneously compounded by a demand shock, due chiefly to rising unemployment
. An uncertainty shock 
followed 
as the world economy came to an unprecedented sudden stop
, the
 consequences 
of 
which 
remain as yet largely unknown.

  10 together with net exports
, while consumption remained a drag on growth. Incoming 
data s
uggest that most of the 
Chinese 
economy has rebounded to pre
-COVID
-19 levels
, but retail sales remain weak. While industrial production has recovered robustly 
(+4.9% y
ear 
on year in July) retail sales continue to decline (
-2.6% y
ear 
on year in 
July) presum
ably due to subdued 
household 
employment expectations. Fiscal policy 
remains supportive of economic activity
, as e
xpanded unemployment insurance, 
higher 
investment
s and tax relief measures 
are 
aim
ed at stabilis
ing
 employment and 
economic growth. Monetary p
olicy is also supportive
, though given the rebounding 
economy 
the authorities are mindful that 
further credit growth could pose risks to
 financial stability.
 In Japan, economic activity
 is recovering 
in the third quarter
 but private 
consumption remains weak
. Real GDP declined by 7.
9% quarter on quarter
 in the 
second quarter
, according to the 
second
 estimate,
 and is slightly revised downward 
compared to the first estimate (
-7.8% quarter on quarter). A 
nationwide state of 
emergency in April and May 
dampened 
activity
, with 
double
-digit contraction
s in 
private consumption of services and in exports account
ing 
for the bulk of the 
decline in
 activity. The former reflects the impact of the domestic lockdown, while the latter 
refl
ects a slump in external demand. 
Recovery in foreign demand 
has contributed to a 
significant rebound in industrial production in July. But the pace of economic recovery 
remains
 subdued as indicated by the composite output PMI which, while increasing for 
the fourth consecutive month in August to 45.2, still remains in contractionary territory 
(i.e. below the 50 threshold). P
rivate consumption of services remains weak. 
The 
consumption activity index 
published 
by the Bank of Japan indicates that consumption 
of durable and non
-durable goods increased in June, pointing to pent
-up demand 
playing an important role 
in the first full month after the lockdown, but 
it 
weakened 
again 
in July
. Consumption of services, which account
s for 51% of household 
consumption, rema
ined almost 20% below its first
-quarter level in June. Although 
improved mobility trends for 
visits to 
restaurants, shopping cent
res and theme parks 
may suggest an ongoing recovery, 
consumption of services has remained broadly 
unchanged in July as compared
 with June. This, together with signals that the 
improvement in consumer sentiment
 stalled
 in August,
 points to a very gradual 
recovery in consumption, partly related to the resurgence of new COVID
-19 infections 
during the months of July and 
August.
 In the
 United Kingdom, after an unprecedented decline in the second quarter, 
the recovery in economic activity looks 
timid
 and incomplete.
 Real GDP declined 
by 20.4% q
uarter on quarter
 in the second quarter
, reflecting a broad
-based 
contraction in all expenditur
e components and especially domestic demand. A 
double
-digit contraction in private consumption has been reflected in a sharp increase 
in the saving
 ratio
. Business investment fell by almost a third in the second quarter in 
an environment of extreme uncerta
inty. While 
the 
composite output PMI point
s to a 
rebound in activity in the third quarter
, the outlook
 seems 
rather uncertain as broader 
survey data suggest continued weakness in business confidence
, together with 
growing fears of unemployment and concerns
 about future economic prospects. 
Government support for the widely used furlough scheme has been extended 
as of
 1 August until October, but the amount of support is lower and a discontinuation of the 
scheme is planned thereafter.

  11 points
 in July, to 1.0% and 1.4%, respectively. The increase in prices was broad
-based 
across items and partly related to the additional costs 
for
 ﬁCOVID
-proofing
ﬂ as 
reported by the O
ffice for 
National 
Statistics
 (i.e. widespread cost increases for firms 
across the private sector 
linked
 to social distancing
). In central and eastern European countries, economic activity is expected to 
gradually recover
, reflecting the lifting of containment measures.
 Real GDP in 
the
se
 countries contracted substantially in the first half of 2020 
because of
 the 
measures adopted to 
limit
 the spread of COVID
-19. 
With
 these measures gradually 
being 
relaxed and production normalis
ing
, activity is expected to bounce back and 
gradually recover a
s of the third quarter, supported by robust fiscal and monetary 
measures. Looking ahead, activity is expected to remain below 
its
 pre
-2019 level
s until the end of 2021.
 In large commodity
-exporting countries
 the outlook for economic activity 
remains uncert
ain given the still high number of infections
. In Russia, real GDP 
in the second quarter was hit by 
a combination of 
the COVID
-19 pandemic, 
the
 restrictions adopted to control domestic infections 
Œ which 
dampen
ed private 
consumption and investment
 Œ and global oil market gyrations weakening the energy 
sector. Against this backdrop, fiscal and monetary policy support ha
ve been gradually 
increased. Economic activity is projected to start recovering in the third quarter, but the 
outlook remains subject to 
cons
iderable
 uncertainty
. Not 
only is the number of
 new 
COVID
-19 cases 
still high, 
investment prospects
 are also subdued,
 given the oil 
production cuts maintained by OPEC+ as well as lower commodity prices. In Brazil, 
the contraction in real GDP in the second 
quarter (
-9.7% q
uarter on quarter
) was 
broad
-based across all items, with the exception of exports of goods and services
, which expanded by around 1.8% q
uarter on quarter
. The COVID
-19 crisis struck 
just 
as economic sentiment had started to brighten follow
ing a period of subdued growth. 
As Brazil is now one of the 
countries 
worst
 affected by the pandemic, the recovery in 
the second half of the year is likely to be shallow. Given limited fiscal space, the 
amount of fiscal support has been modest and 
this sup
port 
is expected to 
cease in
 October. Monetary policy is also supportive and interest rates have re
ached the 
historical low of 2%.
 In Turkey, economic activity was 
left 
relatively 
unscathed
 by the pandemic in 
the first quarter of 2020, 
though it
 contracted in the second
 quarter
. Activity 
remained robust until late March when the COVID
-19 outbreak 
arrived in
 the country. 
In the second quarter real GDP growth contracted by 11% 
quarter on quarter,
 mostly 
on account of the services sector and to a le
sser extent industrial activity. Following 
the gradual easing of containment measures 
starting in
 mid
-May, the economy started 
to partially recover
, driven by the manufacturing sector. However, as the service
s sector remains subdued, especially due to the 
poor performance of the tourism sector, 
it will continue to be a drag on growth in the third quarter. In response to the crisis, the 
authorities have stepped up fiscal and monetary policy stimulus to stabili
se the 
economy, but the weak external demand cont
inues to weigh on the short
-term outlook. 
Pressure on the Turkish lira has intensified recently
, triggered by concerns 
about the 
decline in foreign exchange reserves and the 
national 
authorities™ ability to continue 
defending the currency.
  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2020

  12 Global trade
 is 
expected to record a double
-digit contraction in 2020.
 The sharp 
fall in global imports 
(excluding the euro area) 
in 2020 reflects 
both the
 strong 
procyclicality
 of trade
, especially during economic downturns, 
and also the 
distinctive 
nature of the COVID
-19 crisis. 
The fall in global demand, coupled with d
isruptions in 
global production chains and increased trade costs 
arising from
 the COVID
-19-related 
containment measures have taken a toll on global trade
. In the second quarter 
world 
merchandise imports (e
xcl
uding the
 euro area
) contracted by 10.5% 
quarter on 
quarter, though the downward momentum 
subsided somewhat in May
, and a stronger 
rebound was recorded in June (+6.3% m
onth 
on month
). 
Survey data also point to a 
rebound in trade as the manufacturing 
PMI
 for new export orders 
rose in August for a 
fourth consecutive month, from 46.1 in June to 49.5 in 
August
, and from a low of 27 in 
April 
(see Chart 2). 
Looking ahead, while global trade is expected to bounce back 
along with the gradual lifting of 
containment measures, some scarring effects may 
materialise. In the near term
, as governments decide to keep selective travel 
restrictions in place, at least until a medical solution is found, this may further 
dampen
 trade by raising trade costs
. Finally, 
as the COVID
-19 pandemic has exposed the 
dependence of several countries 
on external suppliers, this may result in 
new 
policies
. Such policies might
 aim 
either 
to diversify global suppliers
, so as to avoid 
mono
-dependence
, or to reshore production, thus ne
gatively affecting complex global 
value chains
. According to the September 
2020 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections, global trade is projected to contract by 11.2% in 2020 and then expand by 
6.8% and 4% in 2021 and 2022 respectively. 
Euro area foreign dema
nd is projected to 
decline by 12.5% in 2020 and to grow by 6.9% in 2021 and 3.7% in 2022.

  13 protracted such a situation is, the deeper the long
-term scars the economy 
is likely t
o be left with
. To illustrate the range of possible impacts of the COVID
-19 pandemic on 
the global economy, in the 
September
 2020 ECB 
staff macroeconomic projections the 
baseline is complemented by two 
alternative 
scenarios
3 Œ the mild and severe 
scenarios. These scenarios can be seen as providing an illustrative range around the 
baseline projection
. The
 pandemic
-related
 risks, in addition to other downside risks 
linked
 to the Brexit negotiations and a 
possible 
rise in trade 
protectionism, remain 
relevant
. However, these other risks
 are 
themselves 
also 
probably
 conditional
, to a 
degree, 
on the future course of the COVID
-19 pandemic and the policy measures 
taken
. Global price developments
 Oil prices 
have recovered 
amid the 
rebo
und
 in economic activity and falling oil 
supply due to production cuts agreed in early May
. After having plunged below 
USD 20 per barrel in April, 
Brent crude oil prices ha
d increased to around USD 45
 per 
barrel
 as at the cut
-off date for the September ECB
 staff macroeconomic projections. 
However, the simultaneous decline in the USD nominal effective exchange rate 
implies that, in many economies, the increase in oil prices was less pronounced in 
domestic currency terms.
 The partial recovery in oil prices ap
pears to be driven
 by 
stronger than expected 
demand for 
oil 
because
 of the easing of lockdown measures, 
although overall
, oil demand is still expected to remain subdued 
and below its 2019 
levels throughout
 2020 and 2021. On the supply side, in early May OP
EC+ agreed on 
cutting production by almost 
ten
 thousand barrels per day, 
which
, together with 
significant shut
-ins of oil production in the U
nited 
States
 and Canada
, supported oil 
prices
. The recovery in oil prices slowed down in August
, after
 voluntary production 
cuts by Saudi Arabia 
expired 
and global oil demand
 stalled
. Compared with the 
June
 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the crude oil price assumptions in 
the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections have been re
vised upward 
by 
18.8%, 27.8% and 20.8%
 in 
2020, 2021 and 
2022, respectively
. Since the cut
-off 
date for the 
September
 staff 
projections, the price of 
crude 
oil has 
decreased
, with 
Brent crude standing at 
around 
USD
 40 per barrel on 
9 September
. Looking ahe
ad, 
even though the oil price futures curve is only slightly upward sloping
, crude oil prices 
are likely to remain volatile. 
This is a reflection of the fact that t
he economic outlook 
remain
s highly uncertain and storage capacity utilisation 
is 
exceptional
ly high.
 Global inflation remains subdued even though the drag from energy prices has 
lessened recently
. Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD 
has increased 
gradually from 0.7% in May to 
1.2% in July
 (see Chart 3). 
The downward drag from 
annual energ
y price inflation 
has 
lessened in 
recent months. E
nergy prices declined 
by 8.4%, 
which was 
less than in June (
-9.5%). At the same time, food price inflation 
decreased to 3.8% in July compared to June™s reading of 4.6%. Annual OECD CPI 
inflation, excluding food and energy, ticked up slightly to 1.7% in July. Across 
advanced economies, annual head
line consumer price inflation increased in the 
                                                                 3  For further details, see the b

 2020) the forward curve of the 
euro overnight index average (EONIA) shifted downwards
. Although 
mildly inverted 
at 
the short end, the curve 
does
 not signal firm expectations of 
a rate cut
 in the very near 
term
. In a continuation of developments over the summer, long
-term euro area 
sovereign bond 
spreads
 decreased over the review period 
amid
 a combination of 
monetary and fiscal support. 
Prices of r

the backdrop of
 a generally more positive short

In foreign 
exchange markets, the euro appreciated strongly in trade

 over the review period
.4 Excess liquidity 
increased by

2,982 billion. This change
 mainly reflects the 
take
-up of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III), as well 
as the 
pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), and the asset purchase 
programme (APP).
5 The EONIA forward curve shifted 
downwards
 over the review period
, especially 
at medium and long

 and the curve
 has become mildly 
inverted 
(see 
Chart

 Despite the inversion, the curve does
 not suggest 
firm 
market 
expectations 
of an imminent rate cut
. Overall, EONIA
 forward rates remain below zero 
for horizons up to 202

 expectations of a prolonged 
period of negative 
interest rates.

 The nominal effective exchange rate of the euro, as measured 
against the currencies of 
42 of the euro area™s most important trading partners,

% over the review period. 
Regarding bilateral exchange rate 
developments, 
the 
effective appreciation of the euro was very broad
-based across the 
currencies of almost all major trading partners of the euro area. In particular, the euro 
appreciated strongly against the US dollar (by 4.6%) reflecting a broader weakening of 
the US dollar amid i
mproving risk sentiment in the context
 of the ongoing global 
recovery
. The euro also strengthened against the Japanese yen (by 2.1%), the pound 
Sterling
 (by 1.7%) and the Chinese renminbi (by 0.6%) and appreciated strongly 
against the currencies of most major emerging market economies, in particular the 
Russian rouble, the Turkish lira and the Brazilian real. Regarding the currencies of 
non-euro area EU M
ember States, the euro appreciated against the Hungarian forint, 
whereas it weakened against most others as these recovered some of the losses 
recorded during the intensification of the coronavirus pandemic in March and April this 
year.

 Euro area real GDP dropped by 1
1.8% quarter on quarter in the se
cond quarter of 
2020 due to the coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic that hit the global economy
. While 
this sharp contraction was essentially driven by the collapse in activity observed in 
March and April, incoming data since May have signalled that the econom
y is 
recovering. B
oth hard data and surveys 
are
 consistent with a 
significant
 rebound in 
GDP growth in the third quarter. 
Alongside 
the 
 rebound in industrial and services 
production, there are signs of a recovery in consumption
 in line with expectations
. Recently, momentum has slowed in the services sector compared with the 
manufacturing sector, which is also visible in survey results for August. The increases 
in coronavirus infection rates during the summer months constitute headwinds to the 
short
-term ou
tlook. Looking ahead, a further sustained recovery remains highly 
dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. 
While the uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic will likely dampen the 
strength of the reco
very in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the 
euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an 
expansionary fiscal stance and a strengthening in global activity and demand.
 This 
assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections for the euro area. These projections 
fore
see annual real GDP 
declining
 by 
8.0% in 2020,
 before increasing by
 5.0% in 2021 and 
3.2% in 2022. Compared with 
the Jun
e 2020 
Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP 
growth has been revised up by 
0.7
 percentage points for 2020
, and revised 
down by 
0.2
 and 0.1 
percentage points 
for
 2021 and 2022, respectively.
 Economic activity in the euro area 
experienced an unprecedented fall 
in the 
second
 quarter of 20
20 due to the COVID
-19 pandemic and the related 
containment measures.
 Real GDP fell by 11.8% 
quarter 
on quarter 
in the second 
quarter of 2020 against the backdrop of lockdown measures at their st
rictest in April 
before being eased gradually over the following months.
 Compared 
with
 the fourth 
quarter of 
2019, real 
GDP
 thus
 decreased
 by 15.
1% overall in the first half of 2020
, bringing it 
back to 
levels last seen in the first quarter of 2005
. The co
ntraction
 caused by the pandemic was
 spread
 broadly 
across countries and 
sectors
. GDP
 declined 
in all euro area countries
 in the second quarter of
 2020, with the 
size of the fall reflecting 
the 
impact of the pandemic and the 
timing and 
stringency of 
lockdown measures in each country
. Among the large
r euro area economies, GDP 
declined by 18.5%
 in Spain, 13.8% in France, 12.4% in Italy, 
9.7
% in Germany and 
8.5% in the Netherlands
 quarter on quarter.
 The COVID
-19 pandemic
 has led to an un
precedented
 drop
 in domestic demand and 
services activity. 
As the 
expenditure
-side
 breakdown
 of GDP (Chart
 10) suggests, the 
fall in activity in the second quarter of 2020 was driven by
 a strong decline in domestic 
demand
 (-10.9%)
. Unlike during past recessions (
such as t
he global
 financial 
crisis
 of 
2007-08), 
it is 
activity in the services sector 
that 
has been 
hit 
hardest
, due to the nature 
of social distancing measures. 
Net exports 
also contribute
d negatively to growth, 
albeit to a
 much
 lesser extent
 (-0.9%)
. Finally, 
the contribution from changes in 
inventories
 was marginally positive (+0.1%)

 Euro area labour 
markets have been severely affected by COVID
-19 containment measures.
 Employment decreased by 2.9% in the second quarter of 
2020, following a decline of 0.3% in the first quarter. This implies that, in the second 
quarter of 2020, there were 5.1 million few
er people employed than in the last quarter 
of 2019. Policy support measures, such as job retention schemes and similar 
arrangements aimed at preventing redundancies and supporting self
-employed 
workers, mostly explain t
he smaller
 decline in employment
 com
pared with economic 
activity. These schemes preserve employment relationships and limit dismissals while 
helping firms to reduce their payroll costs during a cyclical downturn, so that the 
workers are available and the firms ready to resume activity once l
ockdown measures 
are lifted.
6 As such, s
hort
-time work schemes 
limit increases in unemployment while 
allowing the labour market to deal flexibly with cyclical fluctuations, for instance 
through a substantial reduction in hours worked per person employed
 for a 
predetermined 
length
 of time.
 Average hours worked declined by 10.2% in the second 
quarter of 2020, following a quarterly decrease of 3.8% in the first quarter. This implies 
that the fall in average hours worked accounts for more than 75% of the adjust
ment in 
total hours worked. The rest is attributable to employment. T
he decline in
 employment 
recorded during the second quarter is therefore smaller than
 the decline
 in 
GDP, 
implying a marked 12.1% decline in 
labour productivity per person employed in 
tha
t period. By contrast, total hours worked declined by more than GDP, with labour 
productivity per hour worked increasing by 1.2% in the second quarter of 2020 on a 
quarterly basis.
 Labour 
market indicators 
point towards continued job losses in the third 
qu
arter
. The euro area unemployment rate increased to 7.9% in July 2020 from 7.7% 
                                                                 6  See also the box

  22 in June. Between February and July 2020, the unemployment rate increased by 0.7 
percentage points, which is less than the 1.3 percentage point increase observed 
between Septemb
er 2008 and February 2009 following the bankruptcy of Lehman 
Brothers. This increase does not fully capture the impact of the pandemic, as it is 
eased by the labour market policies adopted to bolster employment and prevent 
permanent lay
-offs. It is also li
nked to transitions from employment and unemployment 
into inactivity due to the economic effects of lockdowns and the continued difficulties 
faced by workers looking for jobs as the containment measures were gradually 
phased out. 
Recent survey
-based indica
tors continue to point towards job losses in 
the third quarter, despite the effect of the labour market policies currently in place 
(Chart

 Consumer confidence edged up in August (
to

 remain
ed well below its pre

 level (

). The 
volume of retail sales 
experienced a month

 (see

Due to the exceptionally strong monthly increases in May and June of 
20.6% and 
5.3% respectively, 
however, 
sales in July stood 8.2% above 
the
 average 
reading
 in the second quarter and close to pre

s. Sales of food 
products rose at the beginning of the outbreak (
reflecting their nature as essential
 items, 
the substitutio
n of restaurant spending and 
hoarding), while sales of automotive 
fuels plummeted before recovering. At the same time, sales of non
-food products 
contracted sharply
 at first,
 now standing again at
 pre
-pandemic
 levels
 in July. 
Despite 
the 
sharp
 rebound 
in r
etail trade, the remaining weakness in consumer spending is 
largely reflected in consumer services, notably in accommodation, entertainment and

 Looking forward, t
here is little sign of buoyancy in the demand for consumer 
goods.
 This can be seen in the 
assessment of 
the 
order books of consumer goods
 producers
, the 
business expectations
 of retail firms and
 consumer intentions to 
make
 major purchases.
 While the drop i
n household incomes has been limited, the saving 
rate is expected to have risen sharply in the second quarter before declining again 
thereafter. This reflects forced or involuntary saving due to the constraints imposed by 
lockdown measures, while there is 
also evidence that standard channels, such as 
(countercyclical) precautionary savings, are also playing a significant role.
7 Business investment 
rebounded to some extent as the economy reopened, but 
low demand and financial risks continue to weigh on the o
utlook for the coming 
quarters
. Severe supply
-side disruptions related to the COVID
-19 outbreak caused 
the production of capital goods in the euro area 
to shrink 
by 
21.3
% quarter on quarter
 in the
 second quarter of 2020
. At the same time, n
on-construction 
investment dropped
 by 20.9% quarter on quarter
. These quarterly contractions do, however, mask a partial 
recovery in business investment from May onwards. In the course of May and June, 
the production of capital goods rose by 29.9%, albeit to a level that 
is still significantly 
below that seen in February this year. Survey indicators confirm the picture of a partial 
rebound, as highlighted by a recent improvement in the p
roduction expectations of 
capital goods producers for the months 
ahead and the assessme
nt of their order
 books. In addition
, the latest euro area bank lending survey
8 shows 
that the strong 
demand 
for loans and credit lines 
from euro 
area firms 
seen in the second quarter is 
expected to abate in the third quarter, indicating an improvement in 
business 
expectations
. Nevertheless, still weak demand and the possibility of banks tightening 
credit standards for enterprises amid higher credit risk are expected to limit the 
rebound in investment demand in the coming quarters.
                                                                  7  See also the box entitled

  24 Housing investment plumme
ted by almost 14% over the first half of the year, 
while a gradual and partial recovery is likely to have started in the last months 
of the second quarter and continued thereafter.
 In the third quarter, short
-term 
indicators are consistent with a strong 
Œ yet incomplete 
Œ rebound in construction 
activity. Despite the marked improvement in the Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) for
 construction output 
in July and the European Commission™s confidence index for 
construction companies in August from their troughs
 in April, both indices still stood at 
historically low levels. This weakness may be related to binding constraints on 
construction production due to fewer building permits being issued and more stringent 
containment measures being imposed following the re
surgence of COVID
-19 cases in 
the summer months. At the same time, some stronger signs of recovery came from the 
PMI for construction business expectations and firms™ assessment of order books. 
These dynamics were associated with relatively unscathed deman
d for housing, as 
shown by the European Commission™s indicators of households™ intentions to build 
and renovate and the ECB™s bank lending survey, which shows resilient demand for 
housing loans
 in several countries, thanks in part to debt relief measures f
or 
household loans.
 After the April trough, euro area trade rebounded at the end of the second 
quarter of 
2020, albeit to a substantially lower level than before
. Following on 
from a strong contraction i
n the first quarter, 
total euro area exports and impo
rts fell by 
18.8% and 18% respectively in the second quarter (Chart 13).
 Monthly data covering 
nominal trade in goods in May and June show that euro area exports and imports 
recovered about half of the losses suffered since the start of the pandemic, in a 
context 
where
 some 
containment measures 
were being
 eased. Intra euro area trade, which 
had contracted more than external trade in previous months, rebounded to a larger 
extent as the easing of pandemic
-related restrictions was relatively more pronounced 
in Europe. The collapse in trade in services was even more pronounced, at 21.1% for 
exports and 25.4% for imports
. Tourism, in particular, has been hit hard by travel bans 
and other lockdown measures, as evidenced by the sharp drop in airline capacity. 
Looki
ng forward, the 
outlook for euro area exports is expected to improve 
to some 
extent
. The PMI on euro area 
manufacturing 
new export orders con
firms expansion in 
August (52). 
The 
European Commission™s
 assessment of export order book levels and 
the ECB
™s indu
strial 
new order
s indicators have 
improved for two consecutive months. 
As regards 
shipping indicators
, those for maritime trade 
point to
 a gradual recovery
, whereas those for 
air
 transport remain well below their levels
 of last year
. All in all, the 
data p
oint to a rebound in the coming months which
, however,
 is not complete. On the 
services side, 
the PMI on euro area services new export orders still signals contraction 
and airline
 capacity indices flag a partial rebound for travel in 
the third quarter of 
2020, 
especially 
to tourist destinations

 In the near term, a strong rebound in

growth 
is expected in
 the 
third
 quarter of 
2020. The sharp contraction in the second quarter
 reflect
s the strong 
declines in activity 
seen 
in March and April. 
However, 
incoming data 
signal 
that the 
economy has 
been on a recovery path
 from May onwards. The improvement in 
surveys 
since
 May coincide
s with the easing of lockdown measures. The July and 
August readings of the composite output PMI and the 
European 
Commission™s 
Economic Senti
ment Indicator (E
SI) both stand well above the
 average
 levels in the 
second quarter
. The PMI 
averaged

-August after 
31.3 in 
the second 
quarter
, while 
the ESI averaged 85.0 
and 69.4
 respectively over the same time 
periods.
  While activity in the
 manufacturing sector has continued to improve, 
momentum in the services secto
r has slowed somewhat recently.
 Looking ahead, 
the
 rebound in euro area economic activity
 is expected
 to 
continue in the remainder 
 of 2020, 
provided there is no major resurgence
 of 
the pandemic
. Euro area activity is
 projected to rebound by 8.4% in the third quarter.
 Thereafter, the baseline 
projection 
rests on the key assumption of a partial success in 
containing the virus, with some resurgence in infections over the coming quar
ters 
leading to 
continued containment measures, albeit less 
strict than
 in the initial wave, 
until a medical solution becomes available by mid
-2021. These containment 
measures, together with elevated uncertainty and worsened labour market conditions, 
are e
xpected to continue to weigh on supply and demand. Nevertheless, substantial 
support from monetary, fiscal and labour market policies, all of which have been 
strengthened since the June 2020 Eurosystem staff projections, should maintain 
incomes and limit t
he economic scars which may follow the resolution of the health 
crisis. Such policies are also assumed to be successful in averting large financial 
amplification channels. Under these assumptions, real GDP in the euro area is 
projected to fall by 8.0% in 2
020 and to rebound by 5.0% in 2021 and by 3.2% in 2022.

the trajectory of the
 pandemic, two alternative scenarios have been prepared. The

  27 4 Prices and costs
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 
-0.2% in August, from 0.4% in July
. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil
 and taking into acco
unt the temporary reduction in 
German VAT
 rate
s, headline 
inflation is likely to remain negative over the coming months before turning positive 
again in early 2021
. Moreover, in the near term
, price pressures will remain subdued 
owing to weak demand, lower wage pressures and the appreciation of t
he euro 
exchange rate, despite some upward price pressures related to supply constraints. 
Over the medium term,
 a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative monetary 
and fiscal policies, will put upward pressure on inflation
. This assessment is 
broadly
 reflected in the 
September
 2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro 
area, which see annual HICP inflation at
 0.3
% in 2020,
 1.0
% in 2021 and 
1.3
% in 
2022. Compared with the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, 
the outlook for 
inflation is unchanged for 2020, has been revised up for 2021 and is 
unchanged for 2022
. The unchanged projection for inflation in 2022 masks an upward 
revision to inflation excluding energy and food 
Œ in part reflecting the positive impact of 
the monetary
 and fiscal policy measures 
Œ which was largely offset by the revised path 
of energy prices.
 Annual HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be
 0.8% in 2020, 0.9% in 2021 and 1.1% in 2022
. According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, HICP 
inflation
 fell
 into negative territory 
in August
. The decrease, from 0.4% in July to 
-0.2% in August, reflected a drop in 
HICP inflation 
excluding energy and food
 (HICPX)
 and lower food inflation, which were 
partially offset by less
 negative energy inflati
on (see Chart 15).

 Notes: The latest observations are for

 Despite a strong decline in HICPX inflation recently, overall, m
easures of 
underlying inflation 
point to a
 moderate weake
ning since the onset of the 
pandemic
. HICPX inflation 
decreased to 0.4% in August
, from 1.2% in July
, due to 
declines in both 
non-energy industrial goods (
NEIG
) inflation and services inflation.
 The sharp movements in HICPX inflation during July and August
 are mainly explained 
by temporary factors. NEIG inflation was 
-0.1% in August, after 1.6% in July and 0.2% 
over previous months. The recent volatility in NEIG inflation reflects
, to a large degree
, the impact of a postponement in seasonal sales of clothin
g and footwear
 in some euro 
area countries.
 This exerted strong upward pressure in July, which unwound in 
August. 
The latest movements in HICPX inflation also reflect the temporary reduction 
in German VAT rates since July 2020. Other m
easures of underlying
 inflation 
have 
shown a more moderate weakening 
(data
 are
 mainly

July
; see Chart

6 Measures of underlying inflation
 (annual percentage changes)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The latest observations are for 
August 2020
 for 
the 
HICP excluding energy and 
food (flash estimate)
 and for 
July 2020
 for all other 
measures. The range of measures of underlying inflation consists of the following: HICP excluding energy; HICP excluding ener
gy and 
unprocessed food; HICP excluding energy and food; HICP excluding energ
y, food, travel
-related items and clothing; the 10% trimmed 
mean of the HICP; the 30% trimmed mean of the HICP; and the weighted median of the HICP. Growth rates for 
the 
HICP excluding 
energy and food for 2015 are distorted upwards owing to a methodologica
l change (see the box entitled ﬁ
A new method for the package 
holiday price index in Germany and its impact on HICP inflation rates
ﬂ, 
Econo
mic Bulletin
, Issue 2, ECB, 2019).
 Pipeline price pressures for 
the 
HICP non
-energy industrial goods 
component 
have been strengthening
 moderately
. Producer
 price inflation for domestic sales of 
non-food consumer goods, which is an indicator of price pressu
res at the later stages 
of the supply chain, 
edged up to
 0.7% in July (an increase of 0.1
 percentage 
points
), slightly above its long
-term average of 0.6%. 
The corresponding
 annual rate of import 
price inflation 
decreased 
slightly, however, 
to 
-0.7% in Jul
y, dow
n by 0.2 percentage 
points from its June level
, which may 
in 
part reflect some downward pressure from the 
recent appreciation of the euro effective exchange rate.
 Earlier in the domestic pricing 
chain, intermediate goods price inflation 
increased mar
ginally
 despite the stronger 
euro
. For intermediate goods,
 producer price inflation 
increased to 
-2.0% in July
, from 
-2.5% in June,
 while 
import price inflation 
was broadly unchanged at 
-2.7%
. Growth in compensation per employee 
continued to show a 
pronounced 
decline
 in the 
second
 quarter of 2020, 
largely
 reflecting the fall in hours worked.
 Annual growth in compensation per employee fell to 
-4.6
% during the 
second
 quarter
, from
 0.6
% in the 
first quarter (see Chart 17)
. The decline was broad
-based ac
ross 
sectors
 (with the exception of agriculture and fishing)
 and countries. The 
continued 
deceleration in euro area compensation per employee essentially reflects the 
significant reduction in hours worked per employee after the onset of the COVID
-19 pandemic and the related lockdown and containment measures. 
Annual growth in 
compensation per hour rose to 
9.0
% in the 
second 
quarter
, from 
4.2
% in the previous 
quarter, 
owing
 to the significant reduction in actual hours worked per employee. These 
contrary devel
opments reflect the impact of short
-time work and temporary lay
-off 
schemes in buffering labour income. Negotiated wages grew by 
1.7
% in the 
second
 quarter of 
the year

five years ahead 
rose further by around 
10 basis points 
to 
stand
 at 1.20% 
on 4 September 2020, i.e. almost 50 basis points 
above its historical (mid

market

period of low inflation. 
Inflation options markets also still signal considerable downside 
risks in the near term, as underlying deflation probabilities remain around historically 
elevated levels.

Compared with the June 2020 Eurosystem staff projections, the projection 
for HICP inflation is unchanged for 2020, revised up 
by 0.2 percentage points 
for 2021 
and remains unchanged for 2022.
In the short term, 
the previous collapse in oil pri
ces, 
the appreciation of the euro and a temporary reduction in the VAT rate
s in Germany 
imply
 that
 euro area headline HICP inflation
 is likely
 to remain negative
 over
 the 
coming months. In 2021
, base effects in the energy component and, to a lesser extent,
 the expected reversal of the VAT rate cut in Germany subsequently cause a 
mechanical rebound
.10 HICP inflation excluding energy and food is projected to 
decline until the end of 2020
. Disinflationary effects are expected to be broad
-based 
across the servic
es and goods sectors, as demand remains weak. However, 
continued upward cost pressures related to supply
-side limitations are expected to 
partly offset these effects. Over the medium term, inflation is projected to increase: oil 
prices are assumed to pick 
up and demand should recover, despite diminishing 
upward pressures from adverse supply effects linked to the pandemic and despit
e the 
appreciation of the euro.
 HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected 
to be

  33 5 Money and credit
 The coronavirus (COVID
-19) 
pandemic has continued to bear a significant influence 
on monetary dynamics in the euro area. Domestic credit has remained the main 
source of money creation, driven by loans to non
-financial corporations (NFCs)
 and the Eurosystem™s 
net purchases of governm
ent 
bonds. The timely and sizeable 
measures taken by monetary, fiscal and supervisory authorities have supported the 
extension of bank credit on favourable terms to the euro area economy. This also 
buoyed euro area firms™ total external financing in the se
cond quarter of 2020, as
 issuance of debt securities and bank lending to firms
 increased substantially. Firms™ 
overall cost of debt financing has remained favourable, as the cost of market
-based 
debt has continued to moderate and bank lending rates have remained close to their 
historical lows.
 Broad money 
growth accelerated further 
in July.
 On account of a very large 
monthly flow, t
he annual growth rate of 
the broad monetary aggregate (
M3) rose 
further in July, to 10
.2%, from 
9.2% in June. The shock from the pandemic significantly 
influenced monetary dynamics, as illustrated by M3 gr
owth being around 5 percentage 
points higher than before the COVID
-19 outbreak (see Chart 20). In an environment of 
elevated uncertainty, the 
demand for liquidity by economic agents was 
bolstered
 by the considerable
 liquidity needs of firms
 and the 
precaut
ionary motives
 of all economic 
agents
. Money demand models identify special 
factors 
related to
 firms™ and 
households™ liquidity needs 
during
 the pandemic 
as having made a significant 
contribution to broad money growth
. The increase in money growth was also
 the result 
of sizeable support measures by monetary and fiscal policymakers, as well as actions 
taken by regulatory and supervisory authorities, to ensure sufficient liquidity in the 
economy to deal with the economic consequences of the
 pandemic
. Moreover
, the 
annual growth rate of the most liquid monetary aggregate, M1, 
which comprises 
overnight deposits and currency in circulation
, rose to 13.5% in July, after 12.6% in 
June, and thus strongly contributed to M3 growth.

 Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling. The latest observation
s are
 for 
July 2020.
 Overnight deposits
 have seen a further upswing given the elevated uncertainty
. The
 annual growth rate
 of overnight deposits, which was the main contributor to 
money growth, increased to 
14.1% in
 July
, from 13.1% in June. The growth in deposits 
was mainly driven by deposit h
oldings of firms.
 Money holders™ preference for 
overnight deposits continue
d to reflect
 precautionary motives and
 the very low level of 
interest rates, which reduces the opportunity cost of holding such instruments, 
especially 
when 
compared 
with
 other less
 liquid deposits.
 Furthermore, deposit 
holdings of firms varied across jurisdictions. This was partly related to the uneven and 
lagged spread of the pandemic across countries, which led to differences in the extent 
to which the liquidity needs of firms mat
erialised. Differences in the size of support 
measures across countries also contributed to the uneven pace. C
urrency in 
circulation
 increased at a high, although broadly stable annual rate of 9.8% in July, 
reflecting a tendency to hoard cash given the sub
stantial uncertainty.
 Other short
-term 
deposits
 and marketable instruments made a 
small but increasing
 contribution to 
annual M3 growth
 in 
July, despite the low level of interest rates.
 Domestic c
redit 
has 
remained the 
main
 source of money creation
. In the
 context 
of the COVID
-19 pandemic,
 credit 
growth 
to the private sector 
has remained at an 
elevated level
 (see the blue portion of the bars in Chart 
21). Since 2018
 this 
component has been
 the
 main driver of M3 growth from the counterpart perspective
, with
 loans to non
-financial corporations
 providing most of the momentum more 
recently.
 In addition, the
 Eurosystem™s net purchases of government securities under 
the ECB™s asset
 purchase programme 
(APP) 
and the pandemic emergency purchase 
programme 
(PEPP) incr
eased their sizeable
 contribution to M3 growth in 
July 
(see the 
red portion of the
 bars in Chart 
21). The ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy 
measures are providing enhanced monetary policy support
 to 
stabilise
 financial 
market
s and to alleviate risks to mo
netary policy transmission and the euro area 
macroeconomic outlook during the pandemic. Furthermore, the annual growth rate

, after 
7.1% in June and 7.3% in May
, while growth in loans to hous

 Bank
s™ debt funding costs
 have stabilised at low levels, supported by the ECB™s 
monetary policy measures.
 The 
composite cost of debt financing
 for euro area 
banks, which
 had risen following the COVID
-19 outbreak, declined so
mewhat
 in the 
second quarter of 2020 but remained above pre
-pandemic levels 
(see Chart
 23). This 
was due mainly to a fall in b
ond yields
, supported by the 
ECB™s
 monetary policy
 measures. Bank funding conditions are benefiting from liquidity provisioning on
 very 
favourable terms via the third series of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations 
(TLTRO III), as well as from the beneficial impact of the ECB™s APP and PEPP on bond 
yields, which is mitigating the risk of adverse amplification between the real a
nd financial sectors during the pandemic. 
Given their tight link with sovereign funding 
conditions, senior unsecured bank bond yields 
have also 
benefited from the 
decline in 
bond yields
. Conditions in the market for covered bank bonds 
are being
 supported b
y 
the 
ECB™s 
third covered bond purchase programm
e (CBPP3). In addition,
 deposit 
rates of euro area banks, which account for the bulk of bank funding, remained at 
historical lows in July 2020, thereby contributing to favourable bank debt funding 
conditions.
 Euro area banks 
have 
increasingly charged negative interest rates 
on NFC 
deposits 
held with them 
since the onset of the COVID

. At the same time
, a large part of banks™ deposit funding, in particular retail deposits, still

The latest observation
s are
 for 
July 2020
. Very favourable bank lending rates continue to support economic growth
. Composite bank lending rates for loans to 
firms
 and for loans to households for house 
purchase have remained close to their historical lo
ws, standing in July at 1.51% and 
1.40% respectively (see Chart 24). This development is widespread across euro area 
countries and reflects the lagged pass through of movements in market rates to bank 
lending rates. At the same time
, the severe economic im
pact of the pandemic on firms™ 
revenues, households™ employment prospects and overall borrower creditworthiness 
has continued to 
put upward pressure on bank lending rates. 
After its earlier decline, 
the spread between bank lending rates on very small loans
 and on large loans 
increased somewhat in June and July 
in all large euro area countries
, but remained 
below the levels observed in March.
 Given
 the effectiveness of the measures taken by 
the ECB, 
bank 
supervisors and governments to support credit supply
, upward 
pressures have been contained

The latest observation
s are
 for 
July 2020
. The annual flow of 
total external financing to euro area NFCs is estimated to 
have increased markedly in the second quarter of 2020
, supported by a decline 
in the 
cost of financing for NFCs
 (see panel (b
) of Chart 2
5).
 This increase reflects 
the continuing decline in firms™ 
operating cash flows and their high financing needs 
as 
a result of
 the pandemic shock. The net issuance of debt securities by firms was 
strong in the second quarter and benefited from the 
narrowing of
 corporate bond 
spreads 
facilitated by
 the enhancement o
f the ECB™s APP and PEPP, which include 
net purchases of corporate bonds. The strong recourse to credit in the second quarter 
mirrored a steepening of the economic contraction and continued sharp declines in 
corporate sales and cash flows in the early part
 of 
the
 quarter. Demand for bank 
lending was also supported by favourable bank lending rates (see panel (b) of Chart 
25). N
et issuance of listed shares remained subdued in the second quarter of 2020, as 
the number of new businesses dropped sharply in view 
of a worsening profit outlook 
and despite a marked decline in the cost of equity owing to lower risk premia. 
Furthermore, loan
 volume
s from non
-banks (non
-MFIs)
 fell further
 in the second 
quarter. Overall, total external financing flows were higher in the 
second quarter of 
2020 than during the financial and sovereign debt crises
, supported by favourable 
financing conditions
. The 
overall nominal cost of external financing for NFCs, 
comprising bank lending, debt issuance in the market and equity finance, 
stoo
d at 4.4%
 at the end of June.
 This level 
was around 70 basis points 
lower than the March 
2020 peak 
and only 7 basis points higher than in January 2020, when the series 
was
 at its historical low. Between 
the 
end of 
June and the end of the reference period (
9 September 2020), the overall cost of financing is estimated to have declined further
, by 
around 
24 basis points
, to 4.
1 %, which would be a new historical low
. This is 
consistent with the more supportive bank credit and bond market conditions, bolstered

 Fiscal
 developments
  41 6 Fiscal developments
 The coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic 
continues to have an extraordinarily large 
impact on
 public fin
ances
 in the euro area
. In 
the 
early 
stages
 of the crisis, much of the 
impact was
 relate
d to measures to alleviate the burden on firms, workers and 
households and to preserve production capacity in the economy.
 The policy response 
has gradually
 shifted towards measures 
aimed at swiftly restarting
 the economy and 
prepar
ing it
 for the future beyond the pandemic. The fiscal cost of these measures 
has 
been very substantial for all euro area countries, although both the burden and the 
capacity to res
pond vary across countries. It is therefore highly welcome that Europe 
has responded with 
coordinated fiscal action, most recently with the Next Generation 
EU (NGEU) fund, which complements the fiscal measures at the national level. It is 
important that th
e European Council™s decision leads to practical policy action and that 
the fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency are as much as 
possible targeted and temporary in nature.
 As a result of the economic downturn and 
the substantial fisca
l support, the general government budget deficit in the euro area is 
projected to
 increase significantly to 8.8% of GDP in 2020, compared with 0.6% in 
2019. 
The deficit ratio is expected to 
decline 
to 4.9%
 of GDP
 in 2021 
and 3.6% of GDP 
in 2022. The extens
ive fiscal measures in 2020 have led to a corresponding worsening 
of the cyclically adjusted primary balance, in addition to a negative cyclical component 
reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic situation. The subsequent 
improvement is expected t
o be led by the phasing out of the emergency measures 
and 
an improvement in the cyclical situation
. Uncertainty around the disbursements from 
the NGEU fund and further crisis measures in some countries pose downward risks to 
the outlook for public finances
. Euro area countries have also provided envelopes of 
loan guarantees amounting to almost 20% of GDP to 
reduce risks in the 
corporate 
sector. These guarantees constitute significant contingent liabilities that will negatively 
affect deficits if they are ca
lled on. Reflecting the fiscal measures and the deteriorating 
economic situation, the euro area aggregate debt ratio is projected to rise steeply in 
2020 and remain at an elevated level throughout the projection horizon.
 According to the September 
2020 ECB
 staff 
macroeconomic 
projections
, the 
euro area general government budget 
balance
 is projected to 
decline 
strongly 
in 2020 and to recover somewhat in 20
21 and 
2022.12 Based on these projections
, the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is expe
cted 
to increase 
from 
0.6
% of GDP in 201
9 to 
8.8
% of GDP in 
2020, before declining to 4.9% in 2021 and 
3.6% in 2022 (see Chart 27). 
The decline in the budget balance in 2020 is 
to a large 
extent attributable 
to a deterioration in the cyclically adjusted primary balance 
on the 
back of economic support measures amounting to around 4.5% of GDP, of which the 
largest part is additional spending, particularly in the form of transfers and subsidies to 
firms and household
s, including through short
-time work schemes. This decline is also 
the result of 
a large 
negative cyclical component
 as the euro area economy is now 
deep in recession.
13 The subsequent improvement 
is projected to be driven by a 
recovery in the 
cyclically ad
justed primary balance
, as most support measures are 
                                                                 12  See
 the
 ﬁECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, September 2020
ﬂ published on the 
ECB™s website on 
10 September 2020.
 13  It should be noted that there is an unusually high degree 
of uncertainty surrounding the decomposition of 
cycle and trend at the current juncture.

t for
 their economies, euro area countries have

. In total
, th
ese guarantees amount to 
around 20
% of GDP for the euro area as a 
whole, but the size of the envelopes differ
s substantially across countries. The loan 
guarantees 
are 
contingent liabilities for 
governments and the amount of guarantees 
called on will therefore constitute
 additional public spending
. Compared with the June 2020 Eurosystem
 staff projections, the updated fiscal 
outlook is marginally more adverse in 2020 and 2021 but slightly more 
favourable in 2022
. The euro area general government budget balance as a share of 
GDP has been revised down by 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points in 202
0 and 2021 
respectively, and revised up by 0.2 percentage points in 2022. The higher fiscal 
deficits in 2020 and 2021 are mainly due to a loosened cyclically adjusted balance as 
countries introduced additional support measures or extended existing measures
. This fiscal loosening is partly offset by a less adverse cyclical component and slightly 
lower expected interest payments. The slightly improved outlook in 2022 is due to a 
combination of lower interest payments and a better cyclical component, which mor
e than compensate for the loosened cyclically adjusted primary balance.

14 The fiscal stance is est
imated 
to have been mildly expansionary in 
2019, but is expected to be highly accommodative at 5.4% of GDP in 2020. By 
contrast, in 2021 it is estimated to be contractionary at 3.1% of GDP, as most of the 
support measures put in place during the pandemic a
re currently expected to be 
phased out
 progressively next year. This notwithstanding, the overall fiscal balance 
will remain substantially negative with fiscal instruments continuing to support the 
economic recovery, not least through automatic stabilisers
.15 In 2022 the fiscal stance 
is projected to be neutral.
 The euro area aggregate public debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected 
to surge to 
100.7% of GDP in 2020, before declining very gradually.
 This increase of 16.6 
percentage points compared with 2019 
largely 
reflects the high primary deficits, a 
very adverse interest
-growth differential, and a significant deficit
-debt adjustment 
due to policy measures related to the pandemic.
 In 2021 and 2022 declining, 
albeit still significant, primary deficits will be more t
han offset by favourable 
contributions from improving interest
-growth differentials, as economic activity is 
projected to recover,
 and by a negative deficit
-debt adjustment in 2022 
(see Chart 
28). 
As a result, the debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to stand at 
98.9% by the end of 
2022, a downward revision of 1.1 percentage points c
ompared with the 
June 2020

 1 The Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna in the 
exchang

mechanism (ERM
 II) Prepared by 
Ettore Dorrucci, Mic
hael Fidora, Christine Gartner and 
Tina
 Zumer
 The Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna were included in the exchange rate 
mechanism (ERM II) on 10 July 2020.
 The decision was taken by mutual 
agreement 
of the finance ministers of the euro area countries, the President of the European 
Central Bank, and the finance ministers and central bank governors of Denmark, 
Bulgaria and Croatia
. This 
follow
ed a common procedure involving the European 
Commis
sion and the Economic and Financial Committee
. The start of ERM
 II participation marks the final step of a 
detailed 
roadmap
. This
 roadmap
 set out a 
process which was characterised by constructive collaboration between the Bulgarian 
and Croatian authorities
 and the ERM II parties and based on
 thorough economic 
assessments and the principle of equal treatment.
 ERM II was
 introduced in 1999 as one of the 
ways
 to assess a country™s 
convergence with the euro area
. The mechanism has two main purposes. The first 
is to act as an arrangement for managing the exchange rates between the currencies 
of the participating countries and the euro, and the second is to assist with the 
assessment of convergence 
for 
the 
adopti
on of 
the euro 
as established by Article 140 
of the 
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Therefore, participation in 
ERM
 II is not only legally at the core of the convergence criterion 
on exchange rate 
stability
, it is 
also a
 means of
 testing the sustainability of convergence 
before and 
after 
adoption of the 
euro
. As participating in ERM II for at least two years without severe 
tensions is a precondition for the eventual adoption of the euro, all EU Member States 
are expected to join the mechanism at some stage.
 ERM II is a multilateral arrangeme
nt of fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates 
which provides for a central exchange rate between participating currencies 
and the euro and 
a fluctuation band with a standard width of ±15
% around the 
central rate
. Other main features are central bank interven
tions at the margins of the 
agreed fluctuation band and the availability of very short
-term financing from 
participating central banks. When joining ERM II,
 national central banks 
can 
unilaterally commit
 to 
a narrower
 fluctuation band than th
at provided fo
r by ERM
 II, 
without 
imposing any additional obligations on the 
ECB or the other 
participa
nts in the 
mechanism.
16 During ERM
 II participation, realignments of the central rate 
(as 
has 
happened in the past with the 
Slovak koruna
) or changes to the width of 
the fluctuation 
band may be necessary
 as a result of significant changes in the 
equilibrium exchange 
rate
 of a given participating country
 or in the presence of inconsistent economic 
                                                                 16  Multilaterally agreed bands that are n
arrower than 
the 
standard band should only be considered at a very 
advanced stage of convergence
. This is 
the case 
with
 the Danish krone
, for which a 
multilaterally agreed 
fluctuation
 band of ±2.25
% vis
-à-vis the euro is in place.

maintaining price stability
. Experience shows that ERM II can accommod
ate different exchange rate 
regimes, as is now the case with those of Bulgaria and Croatia.
 The mechanism 
provides sufficient
 room for adjustment to shocks and market developments.
 At the 
same time, the mechanism may incorporate, as a unilateral commitment
, tightly

.18 The process 
leading
 to 
ERM
 II participation has evolved over time, 
but 
always
 rel
ies
 on the principle of equal treatment.
 When the last wave of countries joined
 ERM
 II, more than 
15 years ago, participating in the mechanism required 
making and 
publishing a firm, but general
, commitm
ent to pursue stability
-oriented policies. In the 
subsequent years
, a number of important policy lessons were learned from the global 
financial crisis. 
The crisis
 affected not only the euro area, but also several 
countries 
whose currencies were participati
ng in 
ERM
 II. Euro area governance 
was
 reformed 
following the crisis, resulting in tighter economic and fiscal surveillance and the
 establishment
 of the 
banking 
union. 
During that period it was also better understood 
that 
participation in ERM
 II may have i
mportant implications
, as it constitutes a regime 
shift that can alter the economic incentives of international and local investors. 
In 
particular, 
after 
join
ing the mechanism, 
gross capital inflows 
other than foreign direct 
investment 
accelerate
d sharply 
in several countries, also in comparison with other 
countries in the region during the same period. In some cases this proved to be 
unsustainable, leading to episodes of 
major capital flow retrenchment 
in the 
subsequent years.
 A key
 lesson learned 
from the global financial crisis 
was that, in
 the
 run
-up to 
euro adoption, 
a high level of
 institutional quality and good governance help 
to 
reduc
e the risk of a build
-up of excessive imbalances
. Greater
 structural 
resilience creates the preconditions for 
allocating capital to productive firms instead of 
rent
-seekers, thus supporting the catching
-up process rather than the formation of 
                                                                 17  See ﬁ

 18  Euro adoption is decided on by the Council of the European Union in line with the relevant Treaty 
provisions. After consulting the European Parliament and after discussion in the Europea
n Council, the 
Council, on a proposal from the Commission, decide
s which eligible Member States outside the euro 
area fulfil the necessary conditions to adopt the euro. This decision is taken on the basis of a number of 
criteria 
listed in Article 140 of th
e Treaty on Functioning of the European Union
. The reports on the 
fulfilment of such criteria, called 
convergence 
reports, are prepared by the ECB and the European 
Commission. The Council act
s on the basis of a recommendation of a qualified majority of its
 Member 
States whose currency is the euro.

Moreover, good governance
 implies 
that policymakers are able
 to resist 
pressure 
from
 vested interests against the 
implementation of necessary reforms
 and the building
-up of buffers in normal and good times, 
including 
countercyclical 
macro
prudential 
and fiscal 
measures
. In the past few years t
hese lessons and 
developments have been reflected in the roadmap to ERM
 II de
signed by the national 
authorities of Bulgaria and Croatia in cooperation with the ERM
 II parties.
 The inclusion of a currency in ERM II follows the procedure outlined in 
the 
Resolution of the European Council of 16 June 1997
.19 Decisions 
on ERM
 II particip
ation are taken by mutual agreement of the ERM
 II parties, which means 
achieving a consensus 
about the pursuit of sustainable policies by the Member State
 requesting the inclusion of its currency in ERM II
. At the same time, it has more 
recently been
 clari
fied that reaching this consensus depends on three fundamental 
factors
: (i) 
reflecting the lessons 
learned 
from past cris
es; (ii) 
taking into consideration 
the 
introduction
 of the 
banking 
union
; and (iii) 
recognising the need to take due 
account of 
any 
country
-specific vulnerabilities that 
need to be addressed 
to ensure
 smooth participation in the exchange rate mechanism.
 Based on this approach, the Bulgarian and Croatian authorities identified a 
number of
 prior 
policy 
commitments
, which
 were formally 
adopted 
in 
the 
summer 
of 
2018 by Bulgaria and 
in the 
summer 
of 
2019 by Croatia
. They were 
designed in collaboration with the ERM II parties and had to be voluntarily fulfilled 
before starting ERM II participation. These 
commitments reflect the 
current
 realit
y in a 
way that is reasonable, proportional and motivated. In particular, the commitments 
have to be specific, realistic and verifiable in nature and they have to be implemented, 
monitored and verified 
with
in a relative
ly short 
space
 of time. The
ir fulfilm
ent has been 
monitored and assessed by the ECB and the 
European 
Commission, each in 
their
 respective 
field of competence
, namely
 banking supervision and macroprudential 
policy for the ECB
 and structural policies for the 
European 
Commission 
(fiscal policies
 fall under the 
provisions of the 
Stability and 
Growth 
Pact)
. With a view to e
nsuring a sustainable convergence path
 to the euro area, 
Bulgaria and Croatia made additional policy commitments when they joined 
ERM II on 10 July 2020.
20 In line with past pract
ices, Bulgaria and 
Croatia 
made 
voluntary policy commitments
, the so
-called post
-entry commitments
, when they 
began their participation in ERM II. 
The agreement on participation of the Bulgarian lev 
and the Croatian kuna 
in ERM
 II has also been
 accompanied by a firm commitment by 
the 
respective national
 authorities to pursue sound economic policies with the aim of 
preserving economic and financial stability and achieving a high degree of sustainable 
economic convergence. The authorities, togethe
r with the responsible European 
Union bodies, will closely monitor macroeconomic policy developments and the 
implementation of these policy measures
, in the appropriate frameworks.
 All in all, the 
process 
leading to
 ERM
 II entry has acted as a catalys
t for
 reforms that will mitigate 
risks under ERM
 II with a view to
 subseq
uent euro adoption. Although these reforms 
                                                                 19  Resolution of the European Council on the establishment

 The
 Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II)
  48 do no eliminate risks, 
the
ir importance in preparing for sustainable participation in the 
monetary union
 should not be underestimated.
 The Bulgar
ian lev and the Croatian kuna were included in ERM II with their 
current exchange rate levels.
 The Bulgarian lev has been included in ERM II with a 
central exchange rate of 1.95583 levs per euro, which corresponds to the fixed 
exchange rate under Bulgaria™
s currency board arrangement. The Croatian kuna has 
been included in ERM II with a central exchange rate of 7.53450 kuna per euro, which 
corresponds to the prevailing market rate at the time of its inclusion on 10 July 2020.
 The inclusion of both currencie
s at their current exchange rate reflects the fact 
that 
Bulgaria and Croatia have a remarkable track
 record of exchange rate 
stability
, under which 
both economies
 have undergone
 significant external 
adjustment.
 For more than two decades 


(Bulgarian 
National Bank) has
 operate
d a currency board arrangement under which it commits to 
exchange lev
s against 
the 
euro at a fixed exchange rate
. Hrvatska narodna banka
 has 
maintained
 a managed floating exchange rate regime und
er which the kuna f
luctuates 
within a relatively narrow range around its average exchange rate against the euro. 
While fundamentally different in their functioning, both regimes have served the
ir economies well. In particular
, they proved resilient in periods of severe finan
cial 
market stress, 
including
 during 
the ongoing 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) pandemic
. Moreover
, both countries underwent significant external adjustment 
after
 the 
onset
 of 
the global financial crisis. This involved the correction of large current account deficits, 
which have since turned into surpluses
. As a result,
 there has been a 
sizeable 
reduction of net external liabilities, 
with
 both 
central banks 
accumulat
ing
 comf
ortable 
buffers 
in terms of foreign exchange reserves.
 External rebalancing has been coupled with nominal adjustment
 in both 
countries
, with 
price levels 
clearly 
reflect
ing
 the state of convergence of 
the 
two
 economies.
 Both countries recorded substantial 
increases in prices and costs 
before
 the global financial crisis. These 
were partly a by
-product
 of 
the 
real 
convergence process
, i.e. the fact 
that both countries were catching
 up in terms of 
income levels relative to the rest of the European Union. 
Conve
rsely
, the global 
financial crisis brought about some correction of price and cost levels in 
both Bulgaria 
and Croatia
. As a result, their price levels
 relative
 to the euro area are now well in line 
with their income levels relative to the euro area. While
 such levels
 remain significantly 
below th
at of the 
euro area, this does not 
in itself 
constitute an impediment to 
participation in ERM
 II. Past experience has 
in fact 
shown that countries 
that
 join
 ERM
 II at 
comparable or even 
less advanced stages of conv
ergence 
can subsequently 
introduce the euro 
in a successful way
. In this regard,
 a more important 
prerequisite for 
successful participation in ERM
 II is that price levels are commensurate with income 
levels
 (as shown in Chart A) 
and, more generally, 
with 
the econom
ic fundamentals of 
the country.

 The
 ECB™s enhanced effective exchange rate measures
  50 2 The ECB™s 
enhanced
 effective exchange rate measures
 Prepared by 
Mic
hael Fidora and Martin Schmitz
 The effective exchange rate
 (EER)
 of a currency 
is an index of the weighted 
average of 
its 
bilateral exchange rates vis
-à-vis the currencies of selected 
trading partners
; a rea
l EER is derived by adjusting th
is nominal
 index for 
relative price
s or cost
s.21 The weighting scheme used to aggregate the bilateral 
rates accounts for the relative importance of each country as a trading partner. 
The
 nominal
 trade
-weighted EER 
provides a 
summary measure of a currency™s external 
value, whereas the 
real trade
-weighted
 EER is the most commonly used indicator of 
the 
international price and cost competitiveness
 of an economy.
 The ECB has recently 
enhanced the calculation of its euro 
EER indices to take 
account of the evolution of international trade linkages and, in particular, the 
growing importance of international trade in services.
22 The ECB updates the 
trade weights underlying the calculation of its EER indices every three years, in 
order 
to capture medium
-term changes in the pattern of euro area trade in a timely fashion.
 In t
he most recent exe
rcise, which was finalised in July 2020, the ECB
 revised
 the 
weighting scheme 
to include not only
 manufacturing 
but also
 services trade
.23 Whil
e manufacturing still accounts for the largest part of euro area trade, services
 trade
 has 
gained in importance over the past decades 
in 
the 
light of globalisation and 
digitalisation 
and represented
 around 30% of euro area trade at the end of 2019
.24 In 
addition, improved data coverage made it easier to include services trade on the basis 
of the e
stablished ECB methodology
. The number of trading partners covered by the 
EER indices was also increased from 38 to 42, accounting for close to 90% of euro 
area tra
de in manufacturing goods and services.
25 The 
new trade weights show the role of emerging market economies, which 
became increasingly important for euro area trade during the 2000s, to be no 
longer growing, whereas 
central and eastern European EU Member Sta
tes 
gain
ed in 
importance
 (see Chart A).
 In fact, central and eastern European EU 
Member States 
Œ owing to their further integration into European value chains 
Œ increased their combined share in euro area trade in the period from 2016 to 2018 to 
virtually 
equal that of China. The share of emerging market economies, on the other 
                                                                 21  Harmonised competitiveness indicators (HCIs)
, which are based on the same methodology and data as 
the euro EER indices,
 are computed for 
the 
individual 
euro area countries
. They have been enhanced in 
the same way as the EER indices.

 indices

 There are significant differences in the relative importance of manufacturing 
and se
rvices trade for the euro area™s most important trading partners (see 
Chart B).
 The role of the United States as the euro area™s single most important 
trading partner is primarily due to its large share in services trade with the euro area, in 
particular i
n terms of t
elecommunications, computer and
 information services
, as well 
as other business services; the United States™ share in manufacturing trade is well 
below that of China, the euro area™s most important trading partner when only 
manufacturing is con
sidered. Trade in services is also much higher than 
manufacturing trade for the United Kingdom and the group ﬁother advanced European 
economiesﬂ, whereas it is much lower for central and eastern European EU Member 
States, whose trade linkages with the euro
 area are to a large extent shaped by their 
integration in European manufacturing value chains.

 (percentages

 Notes: Trade weights are averages over the period 20
16 to 2018. Country groups are as defined in the notes to Chart A.
 Import and export weights are broadly similar for most countries and regions, 
even after correcting for competition in ﬁthird marketsﬂ (see Chart C).
 Overall 
trade weights are calculated as
 (weighted) averages of export and import weights 
measuring the share of each country in the euro area™s exports or imports respectively. 
On the export side,
 however, euro area companies compete with producers from a 
particular country not only in the latt
er™s home market but also in other foreign markets, 
i.e. ﬁthird marketsﬂ. To take account of this effect, ﬁdoubleﬂ export weights are used to 
calculate the overall trade weights. While for most countries and regions the single 
and double export weights do 
not deviate much from one another, for China the 
difference is pronounced. This reflects China™s role as the leading global exporter of 
goods, which also implies that it is an important competitor in third markets. The 
opposite is true for other emerging m
arket economies, which account for a significant 
share of the euro area™s direct exports, but compete only to a limited extent in third 
countries as their share in global exports is relatively small. For most countries, the 
import and (double) export weigh
ts are also similar. A notable exception to this general 
pattern is found, however, for EU Member States from 
central and eastern Europe
. The role this region plays in Europe
™s highly integrated 
value chains 
implies that it is 
more important for the euro 
area in terms of imports than exports, both on the basis of 
direct exports and even more so when third market competition is considered.

 Notes: Trade weights are averages over the period 2016 to 2018. Country groups are as defined in the notes to Chart A.

appreciation of
 the

since the beginning of 
2017 has been
 slight
ly less 
pronounced 
in nominal 
terms 
than 
it appeared to be based on the

%, compared with 
13.8

 the 
indicator

(see Chart D)
.27 Th
is revision 
is 
mainly
 due to the increased
 weig
ht of advanced 
economies (reflecting mostly the inclusion of services trade in the weighting scheme), 
whose currencies depreciated against the euro by less, on average, than the 
currencies of emerging market economies.
 In real terms, however, developments 
were very consistent, with both the enhanced real EER

  55 3 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the
 period 
from 6 May to 21 July 2020
 Prepared by 
Simon Forsyth 
and 
Christian Lizarazo
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations and liquidity 
developments during the third and fourth reserve maintenance periods of 2020, 
which ran from 6 May to 21 July 
2020. During this period, the market volatility 
associated with the 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) crisis abate
d. This was helped by the 
implementation of measures announced by central banks
, including the European 
Central Bank (ECB), and the fiscal support measur
es introduced by governments and 
EU authorities
. The l
evels of 
central bank 
liquidity in the 
banking 
system continued to rise 
during the third and fourth maintenance periods of 2020.
 This was largely due to 
the settlement of the targeted long
-term refinanc
ing operation
s (TLTRO III) and the 
asset purchases conducted under the 
asset purchase programme (APP) and the 
pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).
 The Governing Council of the 
ECB decided on 4 June to increase the size of the PEPP envelope by •600
 billion to 
•1,350 billion and to extend the purchase horizon until at least the end of June 2021. 
Moreover, it was decided that t
he maturing principal payments from securities 
purchased under the PEPP will be reinvested until at least the end of 2022.
 In 
response to the COVID
-19 crisis, the Governing Council 
also 
decided to set 
up a new Eurosystem repo facility for 
non
-euro area 
central banks (EUREP).
 This facility will provide precautionary euro repo lines to 
non-euro area 
central banks, 
addressing possib
le euro liquidity needs in case of market dysfunction resulting from 
the COVID
-19 shock that might adversely impact the smooth transmission of ECB 
monetary policy. Under EUREP, the Eurosystem will provide euro liquidity to a broad 
set of 
non-euro area 
cent
ral banks against adequate collateral, consisting of 
euro
-denominated marketable debt securities issued by euro area central 
governments and supranational institutions. EUREP complements the ECB™s bilateral

 Liquidity needs
 The banking system™s average daily liquidity needs, defined as the sum of net 
autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, stood at •1,934.7 billion in the 
period under review.
 This was •321.3 billion higher than in the 
previous review
 period 
comprising
 the first two maintenance periods of 2020 (see 
the section of 
Table
 A entitled ﬁ

•316.6 billion to •1
,794.3 billion, while minimum reserve requirements increased by 
•4.7 billion to •140.4 billion.

  56 Government deposits were by far t
he main autonomous factor 
that absorbed 
liquidity during
 the review period
. Liquidity absorption by government deposits 
increased on average by •261.5 billion to •583 billion. 
Euro area g
overnment deposits 
stood at 
record
 highs
, making up more than 9% of the Eurosystem™s balance sheet on 
average during the revi
ew period
, compared 
with
 less than 6% during the 
previous 
review 
period. 
This g
rowth in government deposits
, which was
 well above trend
, likely 
reflected 
fiscal measures
, or the preparation thereof, 
undertaken by euro area 
governments to address the COVID
-19 crisis. In addition to government deposits, 
banknotes and other autonomous factors contributed •58.1
 billion and •19.5 billion 
respectively 
to an additional aggregate liquidity absorption of •77.6 billion compared 
with
 the 
previous review
 period. Autono
mous factors that 
provided
 liquidity added 
•22.6 billion 
in liquidity relative to the 
previous review
 period
, offsetting only partially 
the above
-mentioned liquidity absorbing effect. In particular, net assets denominated 
in euro decreased by •37.9 billion
, whereas net foreign assets increased by •60.5 
billion relative to the 
previous review
 period (see 
the section of 
Table A
 entitled
 ﬁAssets

, during
 the period under review, the 
supply of 
overall liquidity 
through
 monetary policy operations 
was well in excess of 
the liquidity absorption induced by
 net autonomous factors

 Note: The latest observation is for 21 July 2020.
 The average amount of liquidity provided through tender operations increased 
by •464.3 billion during this review period, attribut
able largely
 to settlement of 
the fourth operation 
in the TLTRO III series (TLTRO III.4) in June 2020
. The 
average increase of •541.5 billion provided 
through
 TLTRO III.4 was partially offset by 
maturities and/or voluntary repayments 
under the 
TLTRO II 
programme,
 repr
esent
ing
 a shift by counterparties to the more economically appealing TLTRO III.4. On average, 
maturities and repayments 
under the TLTRO II programme amounted to 
-•188.3 
billion. 
Apart from
 the TLTRO II and III
 programmes
, the newly introduced LTROs were 
an additional important instrument 
which 
added an average •112.4 billion in liquidity 
compared 
with
 the previous review period. These LTROs 
were introduced on 
12 March 2020
 as a transition instrument to provide immediate access to funding at 
particularly fa
vourable conditions while allowing for a smoother rollover of funds into 
TLTRO III.
 The newly introduced LTROs 
matured before the end of the review period 
on 24 June 2020. During the review period
, the ECB also conducted the first two 
of 
seven 
new pandemic
 emergency longer
-term refinancing operations (PELTRO
s), which were announced in April 2020. These operations 
aim
ed at 
supporting 
the 
smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective backstop to money 
market rates. 
These 
PELTRO
s added an avera
ge amount of •8.2 billion in liquidity. 
The main refinancing operation (MRO) and three
-month LTROs played only a 
marginal role
, recording
 an average aggregate decline of •1.3 billion compared 
with
 the previous review period
. At the same time, outright port
folios increased by •360.4 billion to •3,085.8
 billion, 
owing
 to the continuation of net purchases under the APP and the PEPP
. Average holdings in the PEPP amounted to an average of •285.3
 billion, representing 
an increase of 
•258.7 billion 
in relation to
 the previous review period
. Purchases under 
the 
PEPP represented 
the largest increase 
by far 
across all asset purchase 
programmes

by 
the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and the

 by •437.5 billion to •2,033.1
 billion in the current accounts in excess of minimum reserve requirements
, and by 
•72.3 billion to •330.5 billion in the deposit facility. The partial exemption of excess 
liquidity holdings from negative remuneration at the d
eposit facility rate applies only to 
balances held in the current accounts. Banks 
therefore 
have an economic incentive to 
hold reserves in the current account instead of the deposit facility.

 The
 impact of the recent spike in uncertainty on econ
omic activity in the euro area
  61 4 The impact of the recent spike in uncertainty on economic 
activity in the euro area
 Prepared by Arne Gieseck and Svetlana Rujin
 The coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic has triggered an unprecedented 
increase in uncertainty.
 Substantial uncertaint
y surround
s all aspects of the 
pandemic: the infectiousness and lethality of the virus; the capability of healthcare 
systems to adapt to a surge in demand and to develop a medical solution; the duration 
and effectiveness of containme
nt measures (
such as 
lockdowns
 and social distancing) 
and their impact on economic activity and employment; the speed of the recovery 
once containment measures are eased; and the extent to which the pandemic will 
permanently impact consumption, investment 
and growth potential.
 This box shows how uncertainty has evolved in the euro area and the impact it 
will likely have on real economic activity.
 While uncertainty is not directly 
observable, a number of proxies have been proposed and applied in the literatu
re.
28 This box shows how selected measures of uncertainty have evolved during the past 
few months and exploits the information embedded in a measure of macroeconomic 
uncertainty to assess its impact on economic activity. This is done using a Bayesian 
vector
 autoregressive (BVAR) model which allows us to estimate the dynamic effect of 
an uncertainty shock on the variable of interest.
 Selected measures confirm
 a steep increase in uncertainty coinciding with the 
spread of COVID
-19 in the euro area.
 Chart A show
s how four selected measures of 
uncertainty in the euro area have evolved over the past 13 years. The analysis 
includes two measures of macroeconomic and financial uncertainty. They are based 
on the difficulty of predicting future economic outcomes, which 
is a function of the 
increase in the projection errors for a broad range of business cycle and financial 
variables.
29 In addition, the analysis includes a widely used proxy of forecast 
uncertainty, measured through the disagreement among professional forecasters
30, and a measure of economic policy uncertainty which is based on newspaper 
coverage
31. The chart shows that mac
roeconomic uncertainty, forecast disagreement 
and economic policy uncertainty have increased to 
historically high
 levels since early 
2020, while financial uncertainty has increased more modestly. While the increase in 
financial uncertainty is likely to ref
lect an exogenous increase in uncertainty, the rather 
strong increase of the former group of uncertainty measures is likely to partly reflect an 
endogenous response of these measures to business cycle fluctuations.

 The
 impact of the recent spike in uncertainty on economic activity in the euro area
  62 current context, the imposition o
f lockdown measures led to 
hard
-to-predict variations 
in macroeconomic variables and is thus responsible for at least part of the increase in 
these uncertainty measures. All this suggests that most of the observed increase in 
uncertainty can likely be attr
ibuted to the COVID
-19 outbreak
, which started to affect 
the euro area in February 2020.
 Chart A
 Measures of uncertainty in the euro area
 (standard deviation from mean)
  Sources: Eurostat, Haver and ECB staff calculations.
 Notes: All measures of uncertain
ty are standardised to mean zero and unit standard deviation over the full horizon
 starting in June 1991
. A value of 2 should be read as meaning that the uncertainty measure exceeds its historical average level by two standard devi
ations. The 
latest observ
ations are for August 2020
. Heightened uncertainty is likely to dampen activity via a number of channels.
33 First, as investment and employment decisions may be costly to revert
 or even 
irreversible
, it might be preferable for a company to postpone a decisi
on until further 
information has become available or uncertainty about the future economic outlook 
has diminished. Second, high uncertainty may dampen activity through increasing risk 
premia and the rising costs of debt financing, as 
reduced
 predictability
 is generally 
associated with higher risk aversion. Third, high uncertainty could lead households to 
increase their precautionary savings, which would reduce current private consumption 
and further dampen GDP growth. Fourth, episodes of very high uncertain
ty might 
cause permanent changes in the behaviour of households and businesses, especially 
if they occur frequently. Finally, and given the above
-mentioned channels, high 
uncertainty could make an economy less sensitive to monetary and fiscal policy 
action
s; at the same time, if uncertainty is high, economic policy can be particularly 
effective by reducing uncertainty through several of the above
-mentioned channels
. Model
-based analysis suggests that uncertainty shocks have a substantial 
impact on real econ
omic activity in the euro area.
 The BVAR model includes a set 
of monetary, real and nominal variables, as well as oil prices and a confidence 
                                                                 33  For an overview, see Bloom, N., ﬁFluctuations in Uncertaintyﬂ,

 The
 impact of the recent spike in uncertainty on economic activity in the euro area
  63 indicator.
34 The measure of macroeconomic uncertainty discussed above is used as a 
proxy for uncertainty in the eur
o area. It is included as the first, and most exogenous, 
variable in the model, which implies that the estimated impact can be regarded as the 
upper end of the possible range.
35 The model is estimated over the period from the 
second quarter of 1991 to the s
econd quarter of 2020 using quarterly data, with four 
lags.
36 The model is then used to simulate the dynamic effects of a
n uncertainty shock 
on the euro area economy.
37 An adverse macroeconomic uncertainty shock has a significant negative effect 
on real GDP 
in the euro area in the short term (see Chart B).
 Following an 
increase in macroeconomic uncertainty by one standard deviation, real GDP growth is 
adversely affected for up to four quarters. The biggest impact is observed in the first 
and second quarters a
fter the shock occurs, when the dent in real GDP growth 
amounts to 0.1 percentage points in each quarter. The cumulated impact on the level 
of real GDP one year after the shock is estimated to amount to around 0.4%.
 Afterwards, the significance of the impa
ct diminishes. As is to be expected, real fixed 
capital formation reacts much more strongly to an increase in uncertainty (down about 
0.7% six quarters after the shock) than real GDP, while real private consumption is 
less affected than GDP (down 0.2% one 
year after the shock). In the context of the 
model, a shock to uncertainty causes an immediate and substantial decline in 
economic sentiment and has a lasting impact on employment, which would decline by 
about 0.2% after two years.
38                                                                  34  The BVAR model includes 11 variables with the following ordering: (1) the macroeconomic uncertainty 
proxy, (2) the EURO STOXX 50 index, (3) the European economic sentiment indicator,
 (4) the USD/EUR 
exchange rate, (5) the long
-term interest rate
, (6) the oil price in EUR/barrel, (7) the GDP deflator, (8) total 
employment, (9) real private consumption, (10) real total fixed investment, and (11) real GDP. 
This 
ordering is based on the assumptions that financial markets and monetary variables 
are fa
st-moving
, whereas real macroeconomic aggregates are comparatively slower
-moving.
 35  A robustness analysis in which uncertainty is ordered last, and thus is the most endogenous variable, 
broadly confirms the results presented below.
 36  The BVAR methodology used in this analysis follows Lenza, M. and Primiceri, G.E., ﬁ

 A Cholesky decomposition is applied on the variance

BVAR) has a broadly comparable impact on activity.

The solid line is the median response and the range shows the 68
% standard error bands.
 The spike in macroeconomic uncertainty is likely to have contributed 
significantly to the decline in euro area real GDP in the first half of 2020.
 Most
 measures of uncertainty increased very sharply 
during this period
, and the estimate
d impulse response functions suggest that the biggest impact of an uncertainty shock 
occurs shortly after the shock and in the following quarter. Against this background, 
heightened uncertainty is estimated to have 
accounted for
 around 
one-fifth 
of the 
decline in activity in the first half of 2020, notably in the second quarter, with a 
particularly strong impact on fixed capital formation.
 Looking ahead, heightened uncertainty is likely to persist for some time and 
might therefore continue to dampen euro ar
ea real GDP growth during the next 
few quarters.
 The observed measures of uncertainty remained at highly elevated 
levels in July and August 2020, and they will likely remain elevated in the near term, at 
least until an effective medical solution to the COV
ID-19 pandemic has been found. 
Moreover, the impulse response functions shown in Chart B suggest that uncertainty 
shocks may dampen 
real GDP growth
 for up to 
four
 quarters. All this implies that, while 
economic activity is expected to recover over the next
 few quarters, uncertainty might 
continue to dampen the speed and momentum of the rebound in the near term. The 
BVAR model used for this exercise suggests that the current uncertainty shock will 
fade away only gradually and could dampen the expected reboun
d in activity by a 
cumulative 
5% until mid
-2021.39 Should heightened uncertainty persist for a longer 
period, it could also imply an adverse impact for the longer
-term growth potential.

 COVID

  65 5 COVID
-19 and the increase in household savings:
 precautionary or 
forced?
 Prepared by Maarten Dossche and Stylianos Zlatanos
 The propensity of households to save
 has reached
 unprecedented levels
 in 
response to COVID
-19. The household saving rate derived from the sectoral 
accounts (Chart A) shows a sharp increase in the f
irst quarter of 2020. As quarterly 
sectoral accounts are released with a lag of about three months, real time information 
on the household saving rate is usually scarce. However, using the European 
Commission™s
 consumer survey, a qualitative but more timel
y monthly i
ndicator of 
the
 propensity to save
 can be constructed
. The indicator is 
computed
 as the difference 
between the
 answers to the
 survey 
question about households™ expected savings and 
the answers to the question about their
 expected financial situa
tion
. The indicator has 
reached unprecedented levels, pointing to a sharp increase in household savings in 
the second quarter of 2020. This is also reflected in the increase in households™ bank 
deposits since March 2020, as discussed below.

seasonally adjusted.
 The increase
 in household savings
 is potentially explained by two prominent 
factors.
 First, the 
lockdown
 measure
s 
imposed to contain the virus 
prohibited 
households 
from
 consum
ing
 a large share 
of their normal expenditure basket, leading 
to forced
, or in other words involuntary,
 savings.
40 Second, 
the sudden outbreak of the 
pandemic caused uncertainty regarding futur
e income, and in particular the
 risk of 
                                                                 40  Note that 
given the 
infection risk of COVID
-19 this factor may also include the impact of consumers™ 
volun
tary restraints on certain types of expenditure (e.g. restaurant visits, travel), even if such 
consumption was not prohibited.

41 This

household savings during the first half of 2020.
 Th

 a parsimonious panel model

. Following
 Mody et al.
, a panel model for the saving rat
e can be estimated 
using quarterly data for the five largest euro area countries 
from 
2003 to 
2019.42 While 
this model includes most standard drivers of household savings, th
is box uses 
household expectations about future unemployment to estimate the impact of 
precautionary savings.
43 This is in line with existing literature approximating 
household
-specific unemploymen
t risk by 
household 
expectations about the 
aggregate unemployment rate (
for example,
 Carroll et al.). This choice matters 
particularly in the current situation where, despite a spike in household expectations 
about future unemployment (Chart 
B), the actual
 unemployment rate has so far been 
very sticky.

 COVID
-19 and the increase in household savings: prec
autionary or forced?
  67 household expectations about future unemployment is available until
 June 2020, 
we can use the
 estimated
 mod
el to compute the contribution of precautionary savings
 in 
the first half of 2020
. Forced savings 
seem to be
 the main driver of the recent spike in household 
savings.
 Chart C
 shows how the recent rise in expected unemployment has led to a 
significant contr
ibution of precautionary savings to the rise in the saving rate in the 
second quarter. While the model fits the data quite well over the estimation sample, it 
is not able to explain most of the recent 
increase in the saving rat
e. Most of this 
unexplained r
esidual seems to be attributable to constraints on the consumption of
 many goods and services 
during periods of lockdown and therefore constitutes an 
estimate of forced savings. In the chart, the contribution of precautionary savings 
looks very small compa
red with the estimate of forced savings in the second quarter. 
However, it should be noted that this contribution of precautionary savings is large in 
historical perspective, even though it appears small relative to forced savings.

 Note: The change in the saving rate in the first quarter of 2020 is based on offici
al statistics, while the change in the second quarter of 
2020 is an internal estimate.
 Household bank deposits surged during periods of lockdown.
 In line with a large 
contribution from forced savings
, the spike in savings 
is mainly 
reflected in
 a spike in 
bank deposits, although lower credit flows to households 
also 
seem to have played a 
role in March and April 
(Chart

t should
 be noted
 that the decline in

over
 those months may also have 
been explained by
 the impact

 The latest observation is for July 2020.
 Despite accumulated savings, there is considerable uncertainty regarding 
pent
-up demand in the short
 term.
 Pent
-up demand describes a rapid increase in 
the 
demand for 
goods, temporarily 
exceeding
 pre
-downturn levels
. As c
onsumers 
tend to hold off making purchases during a recession, 
they 
build up a backlog of 
demand that is unleashed when signs of 
economic 
recovery emerge.
 The COVID
-19 downturn is, however, different given the partly forced nature of 
the contraction in 
household spending. Nearly
 half of the contraction in private consumption reflects 
expenditure components which 
could be
 postpon
ed (e.g. electron
ics, cars). R
ecent 
retail trade data 
indeed 
show
 a strong rebound in a number of product cat
egories
 which could partly reflect a catching
-up effect. However, at this stage it is hard to 
distinguish this effect from an apparent shift in consumption baskets in response to 
COVID
-19 (e.g. bicycles, home office equipment). T
he EC consumer survey
 cover
ing 
the period up to August
 (Chart E
) suggests that in the next 
twelve
 months households 
expect 
to 
spend less on major purchases
 than at the beginning of 2020
, despite the 
amount of savings
 they have 
accumulated.
 Therefore, over the next year 
precautionary motives may still keep households™ propensity to save at levels that are 
higher than before the COVID
-19 crisis.

in
 euro area inflation 
and its 
outlook
 Prepared by Gerrit Koester, Ferdinand Dreher and Aurelian Vlad 
 Changes in indirect tax rates can have a visible impact on consumer prices.
 The 
precise magnitude of this impact is uncertain, as it depends on decisions by firms on 
how much of the tax increase they can 
Œ or wish to 
Œ pass on to consumers. Since 
2004 Eurostat has compiled a measure of 
HICP at constant tax rate
s. This assumes 
the 
full and immediate pass
-through of changes in 
indirect taxes 
to consumer prices 
and therefore, on balance, tends to overstate the effects of tax changes.
45 Based on 
this measure, the 
contribution from 
changes in 
indirect taxes 
to euro area 
HICP
 inflation
 has been,
 on average
, 0.2 
percentage 
points,
 but was much stronger during 
periods when tax rates increased, such as in 2007 and between 2011 and 2014 (see 
Chart A
). Chart

r, 
in response to the coronavirus (COVID

 In addition to temporary reductions in 
broad

 Notes: 
The 
latest observation is 
for 
July 2020
. The impact of changes in indirect taxes is calculated as the difference between HICP 
inflation and HICP at constant tax rates inflation, assuming full and immediate pass
-through of indirect taxes.
 The 
actual impact 
of 
the 
recent reductions in indirect taxes on inflation 
is surrounded by 
considerable
 uncertainty.
 First, historically there are few examples 
of 
cuts in indirect tax rates 
in euro area countries that could 
shed light on the 
likely 
degree of pass
-through
.48 Seco
nd, 
the 
abrupt and strong deterioration in the 
overall 
economic environment 
as a result of
 the
 COVID
-19 pandemic
 may 
affect firms™ pricing 
and profit margin considerations differently from those of a normal business cycle,
 thereby 
affecting 
the 
degree of 
pass
-through (see 
the box
 entitled
 ﬁThe impact of the 
recent spike in uncertainty on economic activity in the euro area
ﬂ in this issue of the 
Economic Bulletin
). 
Lastly,
 the lion™s share of the current reduction in indirect taxes 
results from the VAT rate 
cut in Germany, which is only temporary (
and very rare in 
euro area
 countries
), and might thus generate unusual 
anticipat
ion effects. All of this 
suggests that the high pass
-through found in the empirical literature for permanent 
increases in indirect tax 
rates cannot be easily mapped into similarly high 
                                                                 47  With respect to large euro area countries, increases 
in indirect taxes on food and energy 
implemented
 in 
Franc
e and Italy at the beginning of 2020 are slightly offsetting the recent pandemic
-related reductions in 
indirect taxes. Other indirect tax increases 
target
 tobacco (
Estonia, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands and Austria
) and energy (
Latvia, Lit
huania, Luxembourg and Finland
). 48  Decreases

-through effects for the current temporary reductions in rates.
49 The United 
Kingdom
 implemented a temporary VAT cut for a period of 13 months
 in 2008
-09. The 
pass
-through was 
initially 
estimated to 
have
 been complete but, owing to some 
reversals, ultimately it was only partial
.50,51 The pass
-through of 
recent 
reductions in indirect taxes is likely to vary across 
sectors
 and to be overall 
incomplete.
 In the case of Germany, the pass
-through can 
be assumed t
o be substantial in some sectors, such as the energy sector or in the 
supermarket retail sector. However, in sectors suffering higher revenue losses from 
the lockdown or facing higher menu costs, the pass
-through can be assumed to be 
much lower, for exampl
e in the service sector or for retailers of durable goods. 
Furthermore, a substantial share of the HICP basket is not subject to VAT, for example 
rents, and is thus not affected by the VAT change. It is therefore likely that the recent 
reductions in indire
ct taxes will have a substantial impact on food and energy inflation, 
while the impact on HICP excluding energy and food will be less marked.
 The reductions in indirect tax rates 
in euro area countries 
shape the inflation 
profile 
for 
2020 and 2021
 in the September 2020 ECB staff projections
. HICP 
excluding energy and food inflation is expected to increase continuously from 0.8% in 
2020 to 0.9% in 2021 and 1.1% in 2022. However, excluding the estimated actual 
impact of changes in indirect taxes, HIC
P inflation excluding energy and food is 
projected to decline from 0.9% in 2020 to 0.8% in 2021
52 before increasing to 1.1% in 
2022 (see Chart C). While these projections expect only a quite limited pass
-through 
of the reductions in indirect taxes to inflat
ion (only around 50%), the effects are large 
enough to transform a continuous increase in inflation from 2020
-22 into a slight

 Public
 loan guarantees and bank lend

-19 period
  74 7 Public
 loan 
guarantees and bank lending in the COVID
-19 period
 Prepared by Matteo Falagiarda, Algirdas Prapiestis and El
ena Rancoita
 Most euro area governments have launched large
 programmes of public loan 
guarantees 
to preserve
 access to 
bank
 loans
 for businesses
. Demand 
from firms 
for 
bank loans
 has 
soared to
 record level
s since March
 2020 as firms have 
scrambled
 to bridge liquidity gaps originating from the 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) shock. 
This 
increase in
 demand was 
driven
 by a decline in 
the 
capacity 
of firms 
to finance their
 ongoing 
costs via 
operating 
cash flows, owing to a sharp fall in
 their
 revenues during 
the lockdown period
. This
 resulted in acute liquidity needs to finance working capita
l and necessary investments. 
Moreover, in 
a context
 of high uncertainty, firms 
sought
 loans
 with a view to building
 up precautionary liquidity buffers or adapting their 
busi
ness to the new environment
. To help banks accommodate the surge in loan 
demand at favourable conditions, most euro area governments have implemented 
schemes to provide public guarantees for bank loans. These schemes 
transfer
 some 
of the 
credit risk
 and potential credit losses
 from banks 
to governments
, thereby 
mitigating the costs for banks.
 This box first discusses the characteristics of these 
public loan guarantee schemes and their take
-up across the large euro area countries. 
Then it examines how firms™
 take
-up of guaranteed loans is reflected in aggregate 
lending figures.
 The features of the loan guarantee schemes vary across countries but they 
must all comply with the guidelines adopted by the European Commission.
53 Guarantee s
chemes aim at supporting f
irms and self
-employed 
persons 
that have 
been affected by the COVID
-19 crisis 
but had
 not 
been in financial difficulties at the 
end of 2019.
 The schemes
 generally apply to new lending and typically to medium 
and 
long
-term loans (
with an
 average 
maturity of
 five
 years).
54 The window for appl
ying for 
loans covered by guarantee schemes is 
set 
to close at
 the end of 2020
 in most cases
. The maximum amount per borrower 
is typically 25% of the beneficiary™s turnover in 
2019 or twice the wage bill in 2019.
 The share
 that is guaranteed ranges between 70% 
and 90% of the loan principal, 
although
 100% guarantee schemes are also available in 
a few countries
, including Italy and Germany
, especially for smaller loans to
 small and 
medium
-sized enterprises
 (SMEs
) and the self
-employed
. The extent of the coverage 
is smaller in some other euro area countries. In some countries, f
irms benefiting from 
such programmes 
are 
subject to conditions, such as 
a prohibition 
on distribut
ing
 dividends, limits 
on the remuneration of managers 
or 
a commitment to retain
ing
 employ
ees.55 The apparently complex design of such programmes reflects the 
                                                                 53  See Section 3.2 of the Communication from the European Commission on the ﬁ
Temporary Framework for 
State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID
-19 outbreak
ﬂ. 
In some countries, 
governments have simply enhanced existing guarantee schemes. While this box focuses on guarantee 
programmes
 launched by governments
, simi
lar schemes have also been 
implemented
 at the 
regional
 level as well as at 
the 
supranational level, for example the 
Pan
-European Guarantee Fund
 managed by 
the European Investment B
ank
. 54  In some countries, guarantees al
so apply to refinancing and loans granted in the months 
immediately 
preceding the C
OVID
-19 outbreak.
 55  Typically the conditions 
are
 stricter for guaranteed loans granted to big companies and may include 
conditions 
related to
 business investment plans, gov
ernance, competition and transparency. This is 
because the guarantees are often part of large aid plans that may also include recapitalisation by the 
State.

-off between responding quickly to the crisis 
and maintaining a sufficient level of 
prudence
 in order to mitigate any 
undesirable
 behaviour on the p
art of banks, such as 
excessive risk
-taking, or on the part of firms, for example shedding labour while 
receiving credit support from the government.
56 The use of public
 loan 
guarantees has been heterogeneous across countries, 
with higher take
-ups being 
reported in Spain and France, while lower amounts 
have been taken up in Italy
 and 
Germany.
 Since the implementation of the 
programmes in April,
 firms have drawn down around •120
 billion 
in guaranteed loans 
in France and around 
•100 billion in Spain (
see 
Chart 
A, panel a
). 
Relative to the 
gross 
indebtedness
 of 
non-financial corporat
ions, the take
-up has been highest in
 Spain
 (about 11
% of 
gross indebtedness)
, followed by France (about 5% of gross 
indebtedness). By contrast, the take
-up has been 
more moderate
 in Italy (around 
•55 billion, 
i.e. 
about 
4% of gross indebtedness)
 and in 
Germany (around 
•45 billion, 
i.e. 
about 2% of gross indebtedness). In Spain, the 
greater recourse to
 guaranteed loans 
can be 
partly 
attributed to 
the lower availability of 
alternati
ve fiscal relief measures for 
corporat
ions
 (e.g. 
debt 
moratoria
 and direct grants
 of State aid).
 In France, 
the higher 
take
-up of guaranteed loans 
reflects
 their very favourable 
pricing conditions
, especially during the first year of the loan
. In Germany, 
the relatively limited use of 
such loans
 mainly reflects: (i) lower financing needs of firms compared with other 
countries, owing to a less stringent lockdown
 and firms™ 
greater
 use of 
a combination 
of 
other policy measures
, including direct grants and tax
 deferrals and short
-time 
working schemes
; (ii) less favourable conditions 
associated with
 the schemes (e.g. 
concerning the pricing of loans, 
a prohibition 
on distribut
ing
 dividends and limits 
on the 
remuneration of managers); and (iii) some supply
-side bo
ttlenecks related to the risk 
assessment required
 for
 large loans. In Italy, the
 low 
recourse
 recorded so far mainly 
reflects operational bottlenecks 
that initially existed 
on the supply side. These 
bottlenecks have gradually receded 
and in July and August
 the monthly provision of 
these types of loan 
was
 higher in Italy than in 
the 
other countries 
(see 
Chart 
A, panel 
b).                                                                  56  For more details on the key parameters of the schemes and the channels through which they operat

 Notes: The take
-up data refer to approved amounts of guaranteed loans. As guaranteed loans can also be granted in the form of 
revolving credit facilities, the approved amount is h
igher than the amount actually disbursed. The overall size of the schemes is •757 
billion for Germany, •140 billion for Spain, •300 billion for France and •300 billion for Italy.
 SMEs in the sectors 
that are 
most affected by the crisis (e.g. trade, tourism
 and
 transport) seem to ha
ve benefited the most from public

schemes.
 The take
-up of guaranteed loans has been significantly higher for SMEs 
and the 
self
-employed than for large firms, except
 in Germany (
see

The higher take

 Public 
loan

 since April
, especially in Spain and

 Bank lending flows 
to euro area firms 
have 
surged since the outbreak of 
the 
COVID

in 
Europe
, owing to acute emergency liquidity

risk precipitating
 severe liquidity squeezes for firms and triggering bankruptcies, which 
would, in turn, deplete bank capital. This would possibly result in a sudden reduction in

 The
 fiscal implications of the EU™s recovery package
  81 8 The fiscal implications of the EU™s recovery package
 Prepared by 
Alessandro Giovannini
, Sebastian Hauptmeier
, Nadine 
Leiner
-Killinger
 and Vilém Valenta
 The EU™s recovery package represents an important milestone in European 
economic policy integration.
 On 21 July 2020 the European Council agreed on an 
exceptional
 temporary recovery instrument 
known as 
Next Generation EU (NGEU).
 Together
 with the regular 
Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)
, NGEU will ensure 
a coordinated European fiscal response to the economic fallout from the coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) pandemic. While the 2008 
European Economic Recovery Plan
60 was 
only intended to coordina
te national budgetary stimulus packages
 to be financed by 
each Member State, NGEU establishes a joint funding model to support government 
spending and reform in the EU.
 For NGEU, t
he 
European 
Commission has been 
authorised
 to 
raise
 up to 
•750 billion on the capital markets on behalf of the 
European 
Union.
 The funds can be 
used to provide loans of up to 
•360 billion and grants of up to 
•390 billion. These will 
be disbursed up to the end of 2026 and repaid by 31 December 2058 at the latest. The 
NGEU issuance will increase outstanding Union debt by a multiple of around 15, 
constituting the largest ever euro
-denominated issuance at supranational level. While 
the loans will be repaid by the beneficiary Member States, the European Council 
agreed to re
form the own resources system and ensure that grant repayments will be 
covered by gross national income
-based contributions and new EU own resources.
 The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) constitutes the core of NGEU
. The 
entire loan portfolio and 80%
 of the grants will be assigned to the RRF, the purpose of 
which is to support investment and reform in Member States to pave the way for a 
sustainable, resilient recovery, while promoting the Union™s green and digital priorities.
 The remaining part of NGE
U will mainly be used to reinforce EU
-wide spending 
programmes under the MFF.
 To receive financial support under the RRF, EU 
Member States 
need to
 prepare 
national recovery and resilience plans setting out the
ir reform and
 investment 
agenda for the years 2
021-23. These plans 
are expected to
 feature
 coherent 
packages of 
reforms and public investment projects 
and address the challenges 
identified in the context of the European Semester
. They should also strengthen the 
growth potential, job creation and econom
ic and social resilience of the Member State 
concerned
. The 
financial support
 will be disbursed in instalments 
when
 milestones 
and targets
 identified in these plans are reached
. The 
financial 
support 
to be provided under NGEU 
is 
intended to have a 
meaningf
ul
 volume in macroeconomic terms,
 totalling almost 5
% of
 euro area 
GDP.
 The 
idea is for the 
financial support under NGEU to be

 A).61 Based on currently 
available information, the g
rants will 
have
 a more back
-loaded time 
profile 
than the 
loans. While there is still uncertainty regarding the implications for 
national budgets, NGEU would imply a debt
-based fiscal expansion of around 1% of 
GDP on average in t
he euro area over 
the period from 
2021 to 20
24, assuming that the 
support is used at the 
national
 level to finance additional 
expenditure
. Provided it is
 deployed
 for productive spending and accompanied by growth
-enhancing reforms
, NGEU would not only help
 to 
underpin
 the recovery but also increase the resilience 
and growth potential of 
Member State
 economies going forward.

. Notes: The allocation of grants to euro area countries is assumed to follow agreed allocation keys. Only countries with a cos
t of 
borrowing above the expected interest rate on NGEU loans are assumed to 
draw loans up to the ceiling of 6.8% of gross national income. 
The time profile is based on the estimates presented in the European Commission™s proposal for establishing NGEU.
 The RRF allocation key 
ensures stronger macroeconomic support for more 
vulnerab
le 
countries
. In 2021
-22 funds will be distributed on the basis of income per 
capita and past unemployment developments; for 2023 the past unemployment 
developments will be replaced by the observed declines in real GDP in 2020
-21. The 
agreed distribution o
f funds will imply sizeable net
 financial support for those euro area 
countries that face the biggest economic and fiscal challenges after the pandemic (see 
Chart B)
62. Greece will be the largest net recipient of support from the RRF relative to 
GDP, but Sp
ain and Italy, which are expected to be among most heavily affected 
states in terms of both deaths and economic fallout, will also receive sizeable fiscal 
support.
                                                                  61  The European Council agreed that 70% of the gran
ts provided by the RRF would be committed in 2021 
and 2022. The remaining 30% would be fully committed by the end of 2023. It should be noted that a
 key 
characteristic of the EU budget is that decisions on commitments are separate 
from those on 
payments
. The timing of the two is therefore different. The reported timing of payments is based on the estimates in 
the 
European Commissi
on™s proposal for a regulation establishing a Recovery and Resilience Facility
, adjusted to reflect the European Council conclusions of 21 July 2020.
 62  Table 1 in the European Commission

and

ebt
 (notably Cyprus

fied at around 25%.

 Note: 70% of grants are expected to be allocated in 2021

into account population, in

average unemployment is replaced by GDP losses in 2020 (15%) and over 2020
-21 on a cumulative basis (15%) as currently projected 
by the European Commis
sion. Repayments are assumed to correspond to countries™ shares in EU gross national income.
 A coordinated European policy response to COVID
-19 is essential to avoid an 
uneven recovery and economic fragmentation, while promoting economic 
resilience in Memb
er States.
 NGEU comes in addition to the regular MFF worth 
around •1
 trillion over the next seven years and the three European ﬁsafety netsﬂ 
worth •540
 billion agreed in April
 2020.63 As such, the European response to the crisis 
is ambitious and commensurat
e to the challenge 
the continent
 faces.
 Moreover, it is 
important that
 monetary and fiscal policies
, although implemented independently in 
the euro area, are 
currently
 acting in a mutually reinforcing way.
 It will be 
essential to ensure
 that the fiscal sup
port provided through NGEU is 
not counteracted by 
the premature withdrawal of 
fiscal support 
funded at
 the 
national level
. In 
view
 of the depth of the pandemic shock and the 
associated 
uncertainty, the general escape clause 
set out in
 the Stability and Gro
wth Pact was 
activated in March 2020 
with extension 
through 2021
 considered likely
. This allows 
governments to take the measures needed to 
combat
 the pandemic, deviating from 
the adjustment requirements that would normally apply 
under the pact 
while not 
endangering fiscal sustainability.
 While 
macroeconomic stabilisation remains a priority, it will be important to 
maintain fiscal sustainability 
throughout
 the 
recovery.
 The ongoing crisis has 
highlighted how very high levels of government debt may imply vulnerabilities and 
fiscal constraints when a country is hit by a large economic shock. 
It is 
therefore 
essential that fiscal support is used effectively to 
boost
 growth p
otential and resilience, 
which in turn improves 
fiscal 
sustainability.
 EU funding 
should be
 spent in line with 
country
-specific needs and reform priorities agreed at the European level.
 The way that the EU has responded to the crisis also has implications 
for the 
future design and implementation of the European governance framework.

 The
 fiscal implications of the EU™s recovery package
  84 while expansionary fiscal policy is necessary to sustain the recovery, going forward it 
will be important for the fiscal rules to effectively support the reduction of hig
h government debt in good economic times. Second, NGEU constitutes a new and 
innovative element of the European fiscal framework. It will result in the
 issuance of 
sizeable supranational debt over the coming years, and its establishment has 
signalled a pol
itical readiness to design a common fiscal tool when the need arises. 
This innovation, while a one
-off, could also imply lessons for Economic and Monetary 
Union, which still lacks a permanent fiscal capacity at supranational level for 
macroeconomic stabili
sation in deep crises
. The review of
 the economic governance 
framework,
64 which was
 launched by the Commission in February 2020 and 
postponed because of the pandemic, provides a good opportunity to incorporate these 
important considerations.

 1 China™s path to normalisation in the aftermath of the 
COVID
-19 pandemic
 Prepared by 
Alexander Al
-Haschimi,
 Apostolos Apostolou and Martino 
Ricci
 This article will trace the decline and subsequent recovery of China™s economy 
following the outbreak of the co
ronavirus (COVID
-19). It employs high
-frequency data 
to assess the speed at which activity in different sectors of the economy is normalising 
after businesses were allowed to resume operations. One particular focus will be on 
differentiating between the in
dustrial and services sectors, which are subject to 
different health and safety measures. The article finds that China™s economic activity 
rose from a trough of around 20% of normal levels in February 2020 to 90% in the 
span of just three months. While pro
duction capacity recovered swiftly, activity 
normalised more gradually in the services sector, where COVID
-19 containment 
measures had continued to weigh heavily. The recovery was driven primarily by 
private domestic demand and the authorities™ policy resp
onse, as the normalisation in 
China coincided with the implementation of lockdown measures by many of its trading 
partners and hence also with a fall in external demand. Looking ahead, uncertainty 
and risks surrounding the recovery path remain exceptionall
y high, owing in large part 
to the uncertainty regarding how the COVID
-19 pandemic will develop and if and when 
a medical solution to the virus can be found.
 1 Introduction
 Since the mid
-1990s, China™s economy has experienced a period of rapid 
growth resul
ting in 
greater
 interconnectedness with the global economy.
 In 
conjunction with
 a gradual process of reform and opening
-up, 
this has turned 
China 
into
 one of the largest economies in the world and a trading powerhouse. 
Over the 
past five
 years, 
the country
™s economy 
has grown
 at an average rate of 6.7%
, accounting for
 around 
one-third of global growth. At the same time, China™s demand 
for 
foreign goods and services
 from many economies
, including the euro area
, has 
increased considerably
. From 1995 to 2019, 
its share
 in euro area foreign demand 
increased from 2% to around 7%
 (see Chart 1)
. This 
trend 
highlights that the extent to 
which China recovers from the 
COVID
-19 pandemic is critical outside 
as well as inside
 its borders.

 The 
COVID
-19 pandemic 
affected China earlier than 
it affected other 
economies
. According to official statistics, the number of confirmed COVID
-19 cases 
rose from under 1,000 at the end of January 2020 to over 80,000 by early March. Strict 
lockdown measures were put in place to bring the epidemic quickly u
nder control. 
These containment measures necessitated the powering down of the economy for an 
extended period of time, leading to a significant short
-term decline in economic 
activity. While the outbreak was brought largely under control in China, COVID
-19 spread rapidly across the globe, with the number of confirmed cases in other countries 
surpassing those in China by mid
-March. As of early August, worldwide cases had 
climbed to over 19 million.
 The nature of the downturn during the 
COVID
-19 pandemic is 
very
 different 
from other cyclical downturns.
 In the current episode, both supply and demand 
have been supressed through business closures and mobility restrictions. As such, 
there is a higher than usual degree of overall uncertainty surrounding the economi
c 
recovery path, not least because of fears that a flare
-up in new cases could derail the 
recovery. Furthermore, the length of time it will take to develop and implement a 
medical solution remains uncertain, as does the medium
-term impact of continued 
cont
ainment measures on the labour market. In this regard, the recovery in China, 
which commenced earlier than in the rest of the world, can be instructive for other 
economies that are in the process of easing their containment measures.
 2 The 
COVID
-19 outbrea
k in China and its economic impact
 The rapid intensification of the 
COVID
-19 outbreak in China broadly coincided 
with the start of the Lunar New Year holiday.
 The Lunar New Year is a seven
-day 
national public holiday which starts between late January and mid
-February and for
 which virtually all factories close down for a prolonged period of time. During this 
period, migrant workers traditionally return home, gi
ving rise to a peak travel season

  87 which involves several hundred million passengers travelling across China every year. 
Towards the end of January 2020, the Chinese economy powered down, as can be 
seen, for instance, by the coal consumption of major electr
icity producers (see Chart 
2). The extent of the decline in coal consumption in January 2020 was not unusual 
compared with that of previous Lunar New Year holidays. However, owing to the 
COVID
-19 outbreak, the public holiday was extended and the resumption
 of business 
activity was considerably delayed. A comparison of a number of high
-frequency 
indicators of economic activity with their corresponding levels the previous year shows 
that it took more than three months for several of these indicators, such as 
coal 
consumption, real estate sales and traffic density, to return to their 2019 levels (see 
Chart 3).

 The 
COVI
D-19 outbreak led 
the 
authorities to implement 
strict and 
comprehensive containment measures.
 The city of Wuhan, which was at the centre 
of the outbreak, was placed under lockdown just ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. 
Transport into and out of the city
 was shut down and businesses were closed, 
with few 
exceptions
. Within days, residents were prohibited from leaving their homes except to 
make essential purchases, and the quarantine measures were strictly enforced. The 
containment measures were extended t
o the province of Hubei (in which Wuhan is 
located) and to the rest of the country, while the public health response level was 
escalated to its highest state of emergency nationwide. The holiday was officially 
extended and both national and international t
ravel restrictions were put in place. In 
the course of February and March, decisions on reopening non
-essential businesses 
were taken at the province level, depending on local developments in COVID
-19. The containment measures limited the spread of 
COVID
-19. Daily new cases 
increased exponentially for a period of roughly three weeks, before rapidly falling from 
around mid
-February. The lockdown measures introduced swiftly at the end of 
January, as reflected in the Goldman Sachs Effective Lockdown Index (s
ee Chart 4), 
were gradually relaxed again with the decline in the growth rate of new COVID
-19 cases. The overall official number of COVID
-19 cases stabilised at approximately 
85,000. National 
data suggest that the strict lockdown 
measures 
greatly limited t
he spread of the virus throughout China. 
According to official data, about 
80% of all 
COVID
-19 cases and over 95% of 
COVID
-19 deaths in China 
were registered 
in Hubei 
province 
(see 
Charts 
5 and 6
). As Hubei only accounts for 4% of China™s population, 
this 
would
 imply that cases
 in the rest of China were exceptionally sparse.

 The containment measures were successful in 
curbing the spread of
 the virus 
but weighed heavily on China™s economy.
 In the first quarter of 2020
, real 
GDP 
contracted by 
10.0% quarter

 and by 6.8%

. Weak consumption 
made the largest negative

, at -4.4%, while 
investment contributed 
-1.5% 
and net trade 
-1%. 
The decline in economic activity was 
sharp and swift and GDP decreas
ed for the first time in decades. 
The
 Caixin China 
General Manufacturing Output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) 
fell in February to 
28.6
 points, far below the level observed during the 
global 
financial crisis. The

China 
General

 also
 fell substantially
, from 51.8 in 
January
 to 26.5 in February. 
Th
ese
 PMI 
decline
s proved to be short
-lived
, however, 
because in
 March
 the manufacturing PMI rebounded to above 50, implying that the 
trough in business activity 
had occurred in 
February. Nevertheless, 
overall
 PMI 
readings signalled sharp contractions across China™s economy amid prolonged 
production cuts. 
The 
marked
 fall in economic activity 
in January and February 
was 
also reflected 
in the large
 year
-on-year 
contraction
s in indus
trial production (
-13.5%), 
fixed asset investment (
-24.4%) 
and retail sales (
-20.5%). F
or the first quarter 
as a 
whole, 
year
-on-year 
industrial production declined by 9.3%, while retail sales 
contracted by around 19%.
 Labour market conditions have deteriorated 
since the outbreak
 of the 
pandemic.
 Official measures show a 
relatively 
modest increase in unemployment
 sinc
e the outbreak, 
from 5% to 
just below 
6% (see Chart 7)
. Th
is might be due to 
the 
authorities™ efforts to 
persuade many businesses to keep their employees
. However,
 unemployment
 might be higher 
when non
-urban workers
 are included and could
 be a drag on 
future
 economic 
recovery. 
Indeed, employment surveys point to a mixed 
picture regarding expected employment r
ates, with businesses foreseeing a quick 
rebound, while consumers remain more pessimistic about employment prospects (see 
Chart 8).

 The easing of restrictions was contingent

  92 while travel restrictions initially remained in place. The re
opening of businesses 
presented 
a logistical challenge
, as in some instances supply chains had been 
disrupted and 
travel constraints meant that 
workers were 
still 
dispersed across the

 Following the sharp contraction in economic activity in China 
during
 the first 
quarter, the economy made a relatively 
swift recovery.
 In the second quarter, 
China™s GDP increased by 11.5% quarter on quarter and 3.2% year on year, driven 
primarily by investment, while consumption growth remained negative in year

ifferential speed of recovery is also apparent in production and sales data.
 After a weak first quarter, industrial production growth in year

; sales growth improved markedly 
after
 the trough in January and February 
but 
has not yet returned to positive rates
 (see

services 
is due to several factors. Ongoing mandatory social distancing measures 
are 
limit
ing
 the capacity of businesses in a number of sectors
, including catering, 
entertainment, tourism and cultural services. Uncertainty regarding the renewed rise 
in COVID
-19 cas
es, particular
ly in the absence of a
 medical solution
, is 
further 
weigh
ing
 on the 
demand for services where social distancing remains challenging, 
such as transportation. Finally, increased unemployment and economic uncertainty 
are 
lower
ing
 domestic demand for non

affects the service
s sector. Th
e slow recovery in services
 is significant
 for the Chinese 
economy

 January and February data

these months is compared with the sum of the previous year™s data for January and February.
 At the same time, weak foreign demand 
is impeding
 China™s recovery.
 Since
 China 
was the first country to 
expe
rience the 
COVID
-19 outbreak, its recovery 
has 
coincide
d with 
the implementation of strict 
containment measures among its trading 
partners
 as the COVID
-19 pandemic took hold across the globe
. The lockdown 
measures in Europe, the U
nited 
States
 and the 
rest of Asia 
gave rise to
 a strong 
decline in demand for China™s exports
, as
 can be seen in the 
Caixin China Composite 
New Export Orders 
PMI. In February, a supply shock 
reduced
 exports as produc
ers 
and shipping 
ports operated at a fraction of their capaci
ty. Following a nascent 
recovery in March, new export orders declined significantly again in April as external 
demand plummeted during lockdown
s of trading partners. 
Data f
or May 
to August 
show that
 foreign demand for China™s goods is once again recovering
, but 
also that 
the 
spread of the 
COVID
-19 pandemic has led to a decoupling of broader economic 
growth, as 
reflected
 in the
 Caixin China
 Composite Output
 PMI, from its 
new 
export 
orders component (
see 
Chart 12). With export orders
 passing the neutral thres
hold of 
50 only in August
, China™s recovery thus far has been driven primarily by domestic 
factors.

 The latest observation is for August 2020.
 Looking ahead, global d
evelopments 
outside 
China will also be 
important
 for 
the economy™s
 near
-term outlook
. As China emerged from the lockdown, lifting 
restrictions 
on business
es and citizens, important trading partners
, such as Europe 
and the U
nited 
States,
 enforced containment measures. This 
has affected
 China™s 
foreign demand 
at a time when 
its
 domestic 
reco
very 
also remains relatively 
fragile. 
Trade collapsed in the first 
few 
months of the year
 and the sharp decline in exports 
implied a negative contribution of net trade to growth (see Chart 13). In April, growth in 
goods exports returned to positive territo
ry, only to contract again the following month 
as China™s 
main trad
ing
 partners 
implemented containment measures. 
However, since 
June year
-on-year growth 
in exports 
has been increasing
. Imports have remained very 
subdued owing to weaker domestic demand and
 lower oil prices.
 In addition, the 
dynamics of exports and imports 
are
 intertwined
 Œ a considerable share of 
China™s 
imports 
ultimately 
feeds into 
its
 exports
 given its prominent position in global value 
chains
. Recent debates in a number of countries abo
ut access to medical equipment 
and medications may also have longer
-term implications for global supply chains. For 
a number of sectors, such as those considered critical to health or national security, 
countries may choose to repatriate certain production
 stages to assume greater 
domestic control over their production, effectively delinking supply chains. This could 
weigh on the economic growth of countries that are strongly interlinked with the 
relevant global value chains.

 China™s
 path to normalisation in the aftermath of the COVID
-19 pandemic
  99 4 Outlook and risks to the recovery
 China™s 
eco
nomic 
outlook remains 
highly 
uncertain
 despite
 the
 gradual 
recovery
. In the near term, China™s prospects will depend on 
the resilience of 
domestic demand in the presence of increased uncertainty and 
on developments in 
the external environment. 
In addition,
 the outlook is partially shaped by the extent to 
which the 
impact 
of COVID
-19 leads to entrenched changes in the structural and 
behavioural patterns of the economy. At the last 
National People
™s Congre
ss in May 
2020, the authorities did not announce an of
ficial growth target for the year for the first 
time in 20 years. This underscores the current uncertainty surrounding China™s 
economic performance, while also pointing to the difficulties of achieving a rate of 
growth even close to that expected before th
e current crisis. Furthermore, pandemics 
can have long
-lasting effects through
 increased precautionary saving and 
fewer
 investment opportunities
. These potential effects pose additional risks to China™s 
medium
-term outlook and reduce the possibility of a q
uick convergence towards the 
income levels expected prior to the initial COVID
-19 outbreak.
 In the absence of a medical solution to COVID
-19, social distancing measures 
will continue to compress economic growth.
 Until a medical solution has been 
developed 
and is widely available, social distancing measures are likely to remain in 
place. 
Distancing measures
, while essential to control the pandemic,
 will continue to 
affect the economy in a number of ways. In some industries, distancing requirements 
directly 
reduce capacity
, for instance in 
restaur
ants and other venues which host large 
numbers of customers. More broadly, health risks discourage demand for services 
which are associated with denser customer and staff attendance. Furthermore, some 
industries may 
experience permanent demand losses. For instance, increased 
experience with remote working arrangements may permanently reduce the demand 
for 
business travel 
and associated services. It will require time for workers in these 
sectors who have been made redu
ndant to be relocated to other sectors of the 
economy. In turn, the loss of jobs reduces disposable income and can further weigh on 
consumption.
 China™s recovery is subject to a number of risks
 and could be jeopardised if the 
country experiences a
 second w
ave of infections later this year.
 As t
here is still 
high 
uncertainty 
regarding 
the 
availability of a medi
cal solution to 
COVID
-19, it cannot 
be excluded that 
Œ as containment measures are relaxed and social distancing 
is reduced 
Œ a second wave of infecti
ons might force the government to 
reimpose 
restrictions. Protracted subdued external demand
 as a result of 
the pandemic
™s 
development
 in the rest of the world 
might
 also 
weigh on 
China™s recovery. 
For 
example, l
onger-lasting effects 
on China™s trading part
ners, delays in containing the 
pandemic 
across the globe
 or the emergence of second waves could 
all affect
 China™s 
export sector. 
Further r
isks to the recovery 
stem
 from a potential reescalation of the 
trade dispute
 between China and the United States
. Alt
hough the
se
 trade tensions 
have been attenuated by 
the
 ﬁPhase oneﬂ trade deal agreed earlier this year, the 
pandemic and 
its 
economic implications 
have increased the risk 
that agreed targets 
will
 not 
be 
met. A further escalation of trade tensions between t
he two economies and 
the 
resultant 
negative spillovers could further impinge on China™s recovery. Ongoing 
high levels of leverage and other financial imbalances continue to 
indicate
 risks to

  100 financial stability. While the 
Chinese 
authorities have successfu
lly clamped down on 
credit growth in recent years, the stock of debt is still relatively high, both at the 
househ
old and at the 
corporate level. In addition, 
although macroprudential policies 
have curbed the 
growth of the shadow banking sector, its level remains 
elevated
. In 
particular, the short
-term funding structure in large parts of the shadow banking 
system 
could be susceptible to sudden changes in investors™ risk appetite, and thus 
subject to liquidity a
nd rollover risks.
 5 Conclusion
 This article review
s both traditional data and 
non
-conventional 
high
-frequency 
indicators to assess the pace of the economic recovery in China.
 Following a 
downturn that materialised with unprecedented speed in early 2020, t
he economy 
rebounded to activity levels close to those seen prior to the COVID
-19 outbreak in a 
matter of three months. This relatively swift pace of recovery is due to the supply 
shock nature of the downturn, which meant that production capacity was able 
to 
resume in a relatively short period of time. However, the contraction of demand will 
take longer to fully normalise as the ongoing need for social distancing weighs on 
activities that involve denser congregations of people.
 The outlook for China™s econo
my hinges on several 
uncertain 
factors.
 The first 
and most significant factor is the time required to develop and implement a medical 
solution to the pandemic. The second is the potential for flare
-ups and second waves 
of COVID
-19 prior to the availability
 of a medical solution. The third factor is the pace 
of the recovery of China™s trading partners. Finally, a number of structural and 
geopolitical factors also affect the future growth path of China, including the extent of a 
potential decoupling from glob
al value chains, as well as future trade relations with 
major trading partners, particularly the United States. 
While a normalisation of 
economic activity in the course of 2021 appears the most likely scenario, the above 
factors 
could
 lead to considerable 
deviations from 
this
 baseline. In view of China™s 
increasing role in determining global growth, the uncertain factors surrounding China™s 
recovery are of utmost im
portance for the world™s economic
 outlook.

s. 1 Introduction
 In the
ir attempt
s to 
limit
 the 
spread
 of the 
COVID
-19 pandemic, 
all
 euro area 
governments 
introduced 
lockdowns and 
containment measures,
 spurring
 a blend of supply and demand shocks
 which adversely affected 
their econom
ies 
in addition to the economic consequences of the disease itself.
 As the 
pandemic 
unfolded 
across the 
globe,
 many other 
count
ries adopted similar 
measures, thus 
putting the euro area under further strain, as 
commercial and business activities 
were
 closed
, movement permitted only for 
necessit
ies, and 
travel limited to 
essential 
business or where 
force majeure
 made it necessary
. The severe repercussions 
at 
national level 
on the 
spending 
capability,
 consumption and investment preferences 
of 
economic agents have spread
 across 
the globe,
 with 
their intensity depending on
 the 
degree of 
economic and industrial 
interconnectedness.
 This a
rticle 
employs 
multi
-regional
 input
-output table
s to evaluate the 
transmission via foreign trade of adverse shocks generated by lockdown
s and 
containment measures
 across the euro area.
67 This methodology offers several 
benefits. Opting for a full representation of country
-sector production and demand 
linkages allows us to evaluate the spillover and the spillback effects of any 
idiosyncratic shock on output, value added, and domestic and fo
reign trade of any

iterature on the macroeconomic effects of COVID
-19 has been rapidly expanding, touching also

 The
 viral effects of foreign trade and supply networks in the euro area
  102 other country and sector within a single overarching framework. The methodology 
enables us to obtain a breakdown of the full shock
-transmission mechanism into direct 
effects on trading partners and spillover effects on third countries vi
a trading partners 
and on industries. The latter are only indirectly affected as a result of effects on the 
inputs of the sector directly affected by suppression measures. Our methodology 
accommodates the analysis of a variety of shocks, in particular, sin
gle country, 
multi
-country, sector specific and foreign trade specific shocks. The abovementioned 
properties are particularly relevant given the strong interdependence of euro area 
economies and this article™s focus on shocks originating in the euro area. 
In this 
context, analyses based on methodologies that fail to consider euro area 
interconnectedness are likely to underestimate the effective impact of the COVID
-19 shock.
 The remainder of
 this article 
is structured as follows
. The methodological
 framework
, scenarios and related assumptions
 are described in Section 2. Section 3 
describes the channels of transmission and Section 4 discusses the effects on the 
euro area economy of lockdowns and containment measures implemented 
in 
its
 five 
largest economies
. It also 
delves into 
the 
mitigation effects expected 
to result from the 
policies designed by governments to support citizens
™ income and 
business
 activity
 in 
times of pandemic. S
ection

review
ing the
 main takeaways from 
our analysis and 
discuss
es the potential structural economic changes triggered by 
COVID
-19. 2 Data and methodology
 The article
 takes data from 
the Multi
-Regional Input
-Output (MRIO) 
database
 of 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
that reconstructs national and international 
flows betw
een country
-sector pairs
 and
 sectoral final demand
. The database 
encompasses all euro area economies and a broad set of other countries. Compared 
with alternative sources, it also provides more recent information up to 2018 (see Box 
1 for a detailed descri
ption of the database and our methodology).
68 The
 analysis
 uses
 a static representation of the economic linkages across 
sectors and countries to evaluate the 
economic effects 
on individual industries 
of virus
-suppression policies
. Different sectors are 
affected to varying degrees by 
supply disruptions and lockdown measures. T
he entire manufactur
ing industry
, except
 for 
food
, beverages
, tobacco 
and pharmaceuticals, 
has been significantly affected
 by 
COVID
-19 containment measures
. Repercussions on agricult
ure and aquaculture
 have been less severe,
 as 
is the case for certain 
services that 
can
 be provided
 remotely, such as telecommunications (which may even have received a boost as a 
                                                                 68  The conclusions of our empirical assessments have been cross
-checked using the 
world 
input-output 
table
s (WIOT) in the World 
Input
-Output Database (WIOD)
, an alternative source of inter
-country sector 
linkages that includes 45 countries and span
s 56 sectors
, but 
contains
 outdated 
information (the latest 
data are from 2014). 
The WIO
D is a project 
covering the years 2000
-2014 fina
nced by the 
European 
Commission 
and 
developed by a consortium of universities and research institutes. The MRIO
 database
 expands 
on 
the WIOD along two main dimensions
 Œ it extends the tables to 
include 
more recent 
data
 (the 
latest are from 
2018) and severa
l additional Asian economies. However
, it features a 
more limited
 number of sectors (35 versus 56 in the WIOD) as service activities are 
less finely 
defined.
 The MRIO 
database has been extensively used in the literature.

 Box 1
  A working tool: the inter
-count
ry input
-output tables
 This box describes the structure of the inter
-country input
-output tables (ICIOTs) and how different 
types of shocks can be applied to them.
 An ICIOT
 (see 
Table 
A) is 
structured around
 two main 
matrices: the international market for 
intermediates
, Z, and the 
international market
 for final goods
, Y. 
The rows of 
Z are producing country
-sectors and the columns 
are
 consuming country
-sectors. The 
columns of 
Y are pairs of countries and final demand sectors (such as private consumption and 
investment)
, only one of which is depicted in the simplified illustration below
. Both Y and Z consist of 
G times G submatrices that contain the bilateral sectoral supply link
ages between all country pairs.
 Table A

-country input
-output table with G countries and N sectors
 Note: 
Zij
 is the NxN matrix of intermediate inputs produced in country i 
 {1,–,G} and consumed in country j

, VAi
 is the 1xN vector of value generated

, Xi is the Nx1 vector of gross output produced in country i 
 {1,–,G}
 and Yij
 is the Nx1 vector of final goods and services completed in 
country i and absorbed in country j 
 {1,–,G}
. A number of
 aggregate and more granular descriptive statistics can be obtained from the ICIOTs.
 This 
is illustrated below by some examples. Let

matrices, where s, t

 The
 viral effects of foreign trade and supply networks in the euro area
  104 We apply sectoral supply shocks to rows and demand shocks to columns. Shocks are calibrated 
based on internal and external 
analyses of the repercussions of countries™ containment measures.
69 In Table 
A, the matrices affected by a 
single
-country
 production shock are 
represented
 by a red solid 
line, 
an intermediate demand shock by a 
green 
dashed line and 
a final demand shock by a
 blue 
dotted line. Depending on the scenario, 
a shock (
) can 
be single
-country or multi
-country and model 
production disruptions or final demand shocks
. The ICIOT (Z* Y*) including 
the 
production shock 
is 
obtained 
by multipl
ying the rows 
of the affected 
matrices 
by 
the Nx1 shock vector 
s (
=
1, where 
 is the Hadamard product) 
and the ICIOT including 
the demand shock by multipl
ying
 the 
columns 
of the affected matrices 
by
 the transposed shock vector (

=
1). The impact of each 
shock 
on euro area activity and
 foreign trade 
is the difference between the values obtained from the 
pre
-shock ICIOT and the post
-shock
 ICIOT.
70 In a second stage
, indirect shocks
 are applied to model 
the supply chain adjustment to the sh
ock in the first stage. Their calibration is a function of the initial 
shock, the WIOT structure and the assumption on the elasticity of output with respect to 
intermediates, which is discussed below. The economic mechanism is explained in Section 3.
 There
 is, however, a caveat to this approach, which concerns the treatment of shock vector 
intersections.
 Take
, for instance
, a single
-country
 shock to economy c affecting all sectors differently. 
The linkage
 
(1,2), i.e. the intermediate inputs of country
 c sector 1 to country c sector 2, could be 
reduced either by the production shock in sector 1 or by the intermediate demand shock of sector 2. In 
these situations, we assume that equilibrium is determined by supply, which means that the 
production shocks 
are the initial triggers and do not account for further fallout on the activity of sector 
1 due to lower intermediate demand from sector 2.
71  An important
 simplifying 
assumption 
made in our approach is
 that 
a production 
shock
 in one country
-sector pair tri
ggers an equivalent
 intermediate demand 
shock
 and vice versa
. Our strict proportionality assumption is akin to assuming that 
the base reproduction number (r0) is equal to unity and constant over time, hence 
each additional shock will always have a similar 
effect on the economy.
72 This is 
nevertheless a simplification since, in this rapidly changing reality, 
the dynamics of 
propagation 
of a shock through foreign trade 
are similar to those of the spread of a 
virus 
and the contagion rate 
in the 
economic ﬁ
epidem
icﬂ process
 rises rapidly
 in 
the 
early stages
 when few sectors and economies are infected. In the very short run, key 
components and crucial services that suddenly cannot be delivered anymore can 
paralyse entire production chains, but contagion progressive
ly 
flattens
 and abates as 
more and more economies are
 hit.
                                                                  69  These assessments consider 
the e
ffects of 
fiscal and monetary measures on sectors
™ activity and 
countries™
 GDP. Therefore
, while we do not 
explicitly 
evaluate 
the effects of 
policy measures, we indirectly 
take their effects 
into account 
in the shock calibration.

- and post
-shock va
lues of economic statistics were
 obtained through I
CIO
, a built
-in tool in Stata

, World Bank, Washington DC, February 2020.
 71  As a result, the production shock is not exactly
 equal to the value
-added shock
; according to our 
computations, such discrepancies are 
of a 
two
-decimal
 order of magnitude. 
Moreover, this concerns 
sector spillover effects in the
 domestic market 
whereas
 the article focus
es on the international 
transmissio
n of 
idiosyncratic 
shock
s, which is not affected.
 72  In the extreme 
scenario
, when no substitution across inputs, sources 
or final destinations is possible in 
the production process, the entire supply network is 
already 
disrupted by the first shock; in 
a situation
 of 
this kind,
 r0 goes to infinite but then falls rapidly to zero for any subsequent shock.

 The
 viral effects of foreign trade and supply networks in the euro area
  105 In our framework, as long as the relative magnitude of sectoral 
innovations
 is 
preserved, 
the final effects of a given shock are proportional to the original 
shock
. Because of the linearity of our model, shock effects on macroeconomic 
variables can be scaled up or down if the sectoral distribution (in a single
-country 
shock) or inter
-country relative distribution (in a multi
-country shock) remains the 
same. In this w
ay, our assessments can be adapted to analyse
 the effects of milder or 
more severe trajectories that the pandemic might take. Sectoral shocks are reported 
as percentages of the largest shock. Thus, the industry experiencing the sharpest 
contraction in prod
uction takes the value of 100 and shocks in other sectors are 
indexed to it. We calibrate the shocks based on sectoral information available on the 
effects of suppression measures and on analyses from internal experts as well as 
external sources. For examp
le, the shock to weighted aggregate activity in each 
country is set equal to the GDP contraction projected in the June 
2020 Broad 
Macroeconomic Projection Exercise (BMPE).
 The analyses
 rest on some key assumptions and have
 certain
 limitations
, such 
as:
  the
y strip out
 the 
price 
effects 
of implemented policies;
  they provide no information on the implications of and interaction with significant 
monetary policy measures, although the effects of implemented fiscal and 
monetary policies indirectly influence
 the e
xercises to the extent that they modify 
the forecasts of aggregate output developments in 2020;
  moreover, since they are static, the assessments ignore potential permanent 
changes in the structure of economies that may ensue from reshoring or the 
diversifi
cation of essential production processes and changes in lifestyle, time 
allocation across activities, consumption preferences and daily needs. 
 Possible 
trade diversion effects
 are ignored as their appearance may be delayed and 
our analysis focuses on 2020
. The assumption of non
-substitutability of supply and 
demand
 (lower exports by a country will not be replaced by other countries™ exports)
 across origins and destinations 
is strong,
73 drawing on the idea that, as with viruses
, immunisation from shocks disr
upting global value chains (GVCs) 
requires time
. It may
 entail, for instance,
 starting new 
lines of 
production or diverting demand to other 
suppliers
, which may prove to be imperfect substitutes as a result of 
limited supply 
capacity
 or other factors.
 3 Tran
smission channels
 There are several contributions in the literature on GVCs showing that 
production networks propagate idiosyncratic shocks and can be a source of 
                                                                 73  This is a reasonable 
assumption
 in the short
 to 
medium run for some highly specialised services 
and manufacturing
, where alternative suppliers for specif
ic parts and components are difficult to 
find
, especially during global shocks.

  106 aggregate fluctuations.
74 In this section, we discuss the various channels that are at 
play when this occurs and how shocks originate in country
-sectors and spill over to the 
rest of the world, amplified by foreign trade.
 Domestic production shocks
 applied to the ICIOT 
are transmitte
d 
to 
upstream 
and downstream trading partners and further up and down the chain to partner
s of trading partners
 via export and import channels
. Intuitively
, by halting domestic 
production, lockdown measures are conducive to shortages of intermediate
 goods 
produced domestically 
that
 enter foreign production processes 
via
 trading partners 
(known as the 
export channel)
. These shortages generate negative supply shocks for 
companies located downstream in the chain. A
t the same time, 
they 
reduce the 
demand 
for
 foreign intermediates entering domestic production processes
 (known as 
the 
import channel). 
The closure of businesses also 
results 
in a negative demand 
shock for companies located upstream in the production process relative to the 
original locked
-down busine
sses. 
To the extent that intermediates 
cannot be 
substituted
, the entire foreign production line is hampered and, consequen
tly
, purchases of intermediates from any other countr
y are 
reduced 
proportiona
tely. The 
operation of the 
export channel
 propagates in
itial supply shocks further down the 
chain
. Likewise
, lower import demand for foreign intermediates 
has a negative effect
 not only 
on the
ir production in partner
 economies
, but also in other countries that 
supply inputs 
for
 the same processes
. The
 import c
hannel hence has an indirect 
impact on all companies
 upstream
. Besides intermediate
-production linkages, 
lockdown measures also reduce exports of final products
, hence constraining 
consumption possibilities and potentially generating unintended and tempora
ry extra 
savings.
 Final demand shocks in the ICIOT are 
only 
transmitted up the value chain and 
therefore have 
a more limited
 direct 
impact on foreign countries.
 Negative 
demand shocks have a direct negative impact on imports, leading to a reduction in the 
production in other countries, unless firms replace them with exports to other 
destinations; this in turn leads to a decrease in their demand for intermediates.
 This 
process could be reiterated several times up the value chain. We, however, only model 
the first two steps, the reduction in imports and foreign production and the foreign 
intermediates demand shock. This is to account for the time lag that production
 adjustment needs, but also because the magnitude of indirect effects shrinks with 
each iteration.
 To illustrate the transmission mechanism, l
et us
 consider
 shop closures and
, more specifically,
 look at 
the case of a bar forced to lock
 down.
 Intuitively, i
f hypothetically the output of food and entertainment services goes down by 10% and 
these services account for 10% of GDP; such measures will have a direct negative 
effect on GDP of 1%. However, the bar will reduce its purchases of beer, which will 
have an
 impact on the revenues of beer producers which is equal to their share of the 
                                                                 74  See

  107 total costs of bars. If we assume this to be 20%, then an additional contraction of 0.2% 
in GDP will ensue. Looking further upstream in the beer production process, when 
beer sa
les wane, producers order and purchase fewer hops by an amount 
proportional to the share of hops in total costs. If this ingredient accounts for 25% of 
beer production costs, a further 0.05% is shaved off the GDP. The overall effect on the 
country GDP will
 be equal to 
-1.25% if the production chain is entirely domestic, while 
the negative impact is shared internationally if foreign companies are part of the 
supply chain. Our analysis of spillover effects stops at hops although it encompasses 
all the economi
c ties that the bar and the beer producers maintain with other sectors 
and economies.
 4 Euro area
-wide repercussions of containment measures in 
the five largest economies
 COVID
-19 migrated from China across the euro area before spreading to the 
rest of the w
estern hemisphere, hence containment measures outside of China 
were first enforced in Europe.
75 Using the transmission channels explained above
, we 
assess spillovers from the lockdowns, temporary closures, restrictions on 
movement and other containment meas
ures adopted by the five largest euro area 
economies (
Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands
) since early March
 2020. The sectoral distribution
 of production shocks
 reflects the expected differential 
impact of containment measures across industr
ies
. The distribution by major 
NACE
76 category is presented in Table 1. As expected, trade, transport, 
accommodation and food services are among the hardest hit in all countries, while for 
other sectors, particularly manufacturing, there are significant dif
ferences. 
The initial 
aggregate GDP shocks to the five largest euro area economies in 2020 correspond to 
the 
projections
 for
 euro area economies 
in the 
June 2020 
BMPE
.77 However, as 
mentioned above, the overall magnitude of the shock does not matter for the
 computation of shock transmission in this framework, since the results can be scaled 
up.                                                                  75  COVID
-19 initially concerned China
 before 
migrat
ing
 to Europe and spread
ing
 globally 
to b
ecome
 a true 
pandemic. This article studies 
its 
effects in the euro area, 
i.e. focusing 
on the period 
in which
 contagion 
spread 
mainly 
across Europe. However
, since suppression measures were adopted around the globe
, additional analyses have been conducted
 to quantify their 
impact
 on the euro area economy.
 We find that 
the euro area would 
experience a 
2% 
GDP contraction % when the GDP weighted aggregate demand in 
the rest of the world falls by 9.7%. The direct effects on euro area economies are 
a result of
 lower exports 
of final products to the rest of the world. Output in the euro area adjusts to lower exports and the demand 
for intermediates by euro area producers, both from within and outside the region
, also 
contracts. 
Therefore, the proper supply chain
 transmission mechanism is triggered in a second stage and 
contributes about a 
quarter
 to the propagation of the foreign demand shock within the euro area (0.5 
percentage 
points
).  76. The ﬁ

in the rest of the area.
 Aggr
egate 
results are reported in 
Chart 1. Based on the current structure of euro area countries 
and their 
interdependencies, our assumptions and the sectoral calibration above, the 
impact of a shock similar to the COVID
-19 suppression measures applied to the five 
largest
 euro area 
economies 
would be amplified by 15
-28%. This happens in two 
steps. First, in thi
s scenario
, a GDP loss 
of •100 
in Germany causes a loss
 of •13.50
 in the rest of the 
euro 
area through supply linkages (see 
blue bars in 
Chart 1). Lost 
output results in a
 reduction i
n income if the original shock is not countered through 
policy
 measures
. The income shock 
then 
triggers an 
identical
 demand shock that is 
distributed homogeneously across expenditure components, domestic and foreign 
production
, leading to a contraction in
 euro area GDP 
of a further •
8.6
0 (see 
yellow 
bars in 
Chart 1). The main f
inding of this exercise is that the degree of 
interconnectedness influences the amplification of 
the initial shocks.

 Box 
2  The euro area regional production network
 The euro area is a unique example of a regional production network.
 GVC linkages in 
the region
 reflect an intricate 
supply
 web
 with more than one hub, comprising 
production, shipping and financial 
centres.
 Intermediates travelling across several borders in such networks form the majority of euro 
area trade, while 
disruptions 
are 
transmit
ted 
across 
the region
 either because inputs from 
another 
euro area country
 beco
me unavailable (forward linkages) or because as 
firms
 in the rest of the euro 
area reduce their output
, foreign demand for 
domestic 
intermediates 
wanes (backward linkages). In 
this context,
 demand and supply shocks 
blend 
and reinforce each other as 
they pr
opagate among 
member state
s. This box describes the euro area production network and discusses how it has changed, focusing in 
particular on the period after the GFC.
 Intra
-euro area GVC trade is compared with trade 
with 
other 
main trading partners/regions (the eight non
-euro area economies in the European Union, China, the 
United States and the rest of the world). The analysis uses a refined definition of GVC trade that 
distinguishes between shallow and deep GVC linkages.
 In particular, GVC trade is defined in the 
literature as 
the share of 
exports and imports
 that crosses at least t
wo borders 
(concerning three

 economies) 
before reaching the final destination
.78 We further separate it into deep and shallow GVC 
trade. The fo
rmer is the share of exported and imported intermediates entering intermediate stages of 
production in the importing
-exporting country (blue bars in Chart A) while shallow GVC trade occurs 
when the goods and services produced in a global network are traded
 directly with the final absorbing 
partner (yellow bars in Chart A). This distinction is key when disentangling trade within a production 
network from GVC trade with other production networks

. Notes: The 
sum of blue and yellow bars represents GVC exports, i.e. the 
share of total exports that crosses at least t
wo borders before reaching th
e final 
destination. The chart breaks down total GVC trade into shallow GVC linkages, that is the
 share reachin
g the final transforming economy
 (yellow bars)
, and 
deep 
GVC exports, that is intermediates processed and then re
-exported
 for further processing
 (blue bars)
. The European production network remains the engine behind aggregate activity in the euro area.
 In 
2018, three
-quarters of the intermediates exported by euro area countries within the European Union 
were destined for further processing and 
re-export
ing; two
-thirds reached
 another euro area member
. The share of GVC trade in intermediates exported at intermediate stages of production (of total 
intra
-euro area trade) is 
three t
imes as large as that 
with 
China (33% versus 11%, see blue bars in 
Char
t A) and four times as great as that with the United States (8%). Indeed, the bulk of GVC trade 
with other regions occurs at the final stages of production, i.e. it concerns intermediates directly 
embedded in finished goods (see yellow bars in Chart A).
 Supply chains in the euro area continued to develop amid a decline in GVCs™ share of total global 
exports since before the GFC.
 While
 the global trade slowdown did not spare euro area trade, the 
euro area 
actually 
strengthened its position as 
a leader in 
GVC
s relative to other regions
 after
 the 
GFC. More than half of total exports consist of production 
that is 
processed across several borders, a 
share far greater than 
in 
China 
or the U
nited 
States
 (both around 30%).
 Since the GFC, the euro area has reorganise
d its internal production network, further deepening its 
regional core and expanding its influence on the rest of the EU.

. Moreover
, the core of euro area 
supply chains deepened

concerned sha
llow linkages (green or yellow).

. Notes:
 The chart breaks down the total change in GVC exports (the share of trade that crosses at l
east two borders before reaching the final destination, red 
dots) between 2008 and 2018 into three main components: the share that consists of intermediates embedded in finished product
ion (yellow), the share of 
exports in final goods that were produced in
 a supply chain (green) and the share of intermediates that are processed by the importer and then re
-exported for 
further processing (blue).
 Integration within the euro area is clustered around a few economies (Germany and the Netherlands 
in particular).
 Based on the bilateral flows in intermediates crossing at least t
wo borders, the five 
largest euro area economies are primarily integrated with the Netherlands,
 which acts as
 the euro 
area delivery and arrival point for exports and imports from the rest of
 the world. Germany is the 
manufacturing
 hub but Italy 
also 
appears 
to have a 
more central position compared 
with 
France and 
Spain.
 Other members of the European Union 
share 
a dense matrix of bilateral GVC trade with the 
euro area, especially with Germany,
 Austria and Italy.
 Eastern enlargement of the euro area and improvements in stressed countries explain the success of 
its regional supply chains after the GFC.
 Our
 analysis 
indicates
 that, despite le
ss favourable global 
conditions, rising protectionist me
asures 
and a globalisation reset 
in other regions
, supply networks in 
the euro area were boosted by the greater integration of new members (Lithuania, Slovakia and 
Estonia) with the core.
80 These countries not only strengthened their position in the regiona
l network 
as both an origin and destination for parts and components, but some of them attracted a growing 
share of production from other regions (the United States and China) that they embedded in their 
                                                                 80  For Latvia, empirical evidence is less strong; the country™s importance as a producer of intermediates has 
grown but it 
has not attracted more GVC exports into its borders.

 processes.
81 A significant contribution also comes fr
om countries like Spain, Portugal and Greece 
that improved their participation in regional GVCs relative to their pre
-GFC values.
82 Since 2008, imports of intermediates from the rest of the world that are further processed in the euro 
area have expanded sub
stantially as other emerging economies have gained traction in terms of 
participation in GVCs.
83 While too early to draw a conclusion, the role of the heterogeneous group of 
countries composing the ﬁRest of the Worldﬂ, which encompasses commodities exporter
s as well as 
Vietnam, Turkey and the Philippines, is growing steadily in terms of GVC participation. A benign 
interpretation of this evidence 
from a 
global 
perspective is that GVCs
 may not be
 falling ap
art but 
rather changing to accommodate a diversified 
set of players, leading to a less concentrated global 
production network.
  5 Conclusion
 This article analyses how domestic adverse shocks generated by containment 
measures are transmitted and magnified within the euro area.
 International
 country
-sector
 inter
connectedness
 and openness determine the strength of 
the 
propagation of shocks
 via foreign trade
, but o
ur analysis has shown that the 
amplification effects and t
he transmission channels vary depending on the type of 
shock
. Shocks
 propagat
e strongly 
in the 
euro area because the region is a typical 
example of 
a regional
 production network in which final
 demand 
linkages are 
also 
very important.
 Transmission 
to the rest of the euro area
 of a shock originating 
in one of the five largest Member States ranges from
 15% to 28% when supply and 
demand channels are taken into account. 
A common or coordinated response 
through 
targ
eted fiscal measures can help forestall such amplification effects. In addition, 
these effects need to be taken into account when assessing the
 impact on real GDP 
and inflation and when deciding on the appropriate monetary policy response.
                                                                  81  Euro area integration
 with the 
United States
 was broadly stable after the GFC. However,
 the aggregate 
data conceals 
Germany
™s decline 
as 
a destination
, which was offset by
 an increase in the trade of 
parts 
and components from the 
United States
 to new Member States.
 82  Euro area GVC integration with other regions remains shallow. 60% of exports to China and the United 
States consist of domestic production for direct final absorption; this compares with 
just 40% of domestic 
production exported by one 
Member 
State 
directly to another euro area absorbing 
Member 
State. 
Similarly,
 almost 50% of the intermediates exported to Asia and America are directly delivered to 
the 
final 
destination 
which deals
 only with
 the transformation in
to final goods and absorb
s them domestically. 
When intermediates originat
ing
 in the euro area are further traded by Asian and American firms
, they are 
mostly
 re-exported within the region. See

-euro 
area
 supply chains d
id not 
entail
 a retrenchment of 
its trade
 integration 
with 
the rest of the world. Although they were initially set back, exports and imports from the rest of the world
 progressed at a pace comparable to global activity in the
 aftermath of the GFC. 
Trade integration with 
China 
has taken a new path as
 demand for euro area production has grown steadily, making 
China
 a top 
destination 
for
 European firms™ 
output
. Indeed
, the domestic production content of euro area exports to 
China
 expanded after the GFC; intermediates, parts and components delivered elsewhere
, however,
 experienced a decline.
 A possible interpretation of this evidence is that euro area companies moved 
gradually to local production, i.e. trade has been replaced with 
foreign direct investments. Nonetheless, 
the Chinese production content of eu
ro area imports did not decline but remained stable.

 3 Automatic fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the 
COVID
-19 crisis
 Prepared by Othman Bouabdallah, Cristina Checherita
-Westphal, 

 1 Introduction
 Authorities in the euro 
area have taken exceptional policy action to stem the 
economic fallout from the coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic.
 The
 ECB 
committed to using the
 full potential of 
the
 monetary policy tools at its disposal within 
its mandate. At the same time, euro area gove
rnments implemented siz
eable
 packages of fiscal measures
, consisting
, in particular,
 of discretionary fiscal stimulus 
measures. As of end
-May 2020, the discretionary fiscal measures by themselves 
amounted to about 3.25% of GDP at the aggregate euro area 
level.
84 Furthermore
, leaders at the European level have agreed on 
a major recovery 
plan embedded in the 
EU budget. When 
implemented, the EU budget 
will
 temporarily almost double in size 
to around 2% of GDP.
85 In addition to these
 discretionary
 measures, aut
omatic fiscal stabilisers in the 
euro area countries 
play an 
important 
role in 
cushion
ing
 the economic shock
 caused by the pandemic
. Automatic fiscal stabilisers refer to elements
, built 
into government revenues and expenditures
, that reduce fluctuations i
n economic activity
 without the need for discretionary government actions
. Together with discretionary 
fiscal policy measures, t
hese
 are especially 
important in a currency union such as 
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), where 
Œ alongside
 the 
common moneta
ry 
policy 
Œ instruments are needed that address idiosyncratic, country
-specific shocks. In 
principle, automatic stabilisers have the advantage of 
being
 timely, targeted and 
temporary in smoothing the economic cycle. Furthermore, these
 do not suffer some of
 the
 same
 drawbacks 
as 
discretionary fiscal measures, such as
 the need for 
measurement of
 the economic cycle or implementation lags.
 This article examines automatic fiscal stabilisers 
in the euro area 
and their 
ability to provide economic stabilisation 
dur
ing
 the COVID
-19 crisis.
86 While the 
concept is well
-established in macroeconomics, the term ﬁautomatic fiscal stabilisersﬂ 
is not used entirely consistently in the literature and may refer to somewhat different 
concepts, which are presented in Section 2. E
stimates 
made by
 the European System 
of Central Banks (ESCB), as presented in Section 3, suggest that automatic fiscal 
stabilisers are generally sizeable but vary significantly across euro area countries. Box 
1 shows that this assessment is 
also 
broadly co
nfirmed by other comparable 
estimates. 
Even though they are related, t
he size of automatic fiscal stabilisers should 
be distinguished from their effectiveness
 in terms of
 their impact on reducing 
                                                                 84  See the box entitled ﬁ

 fluctuations in economic activity. 
During
 the COVID
-19 crisis a number of factors may 
have limited the effectiveness of automatic stabilisers 
in contributing to
 macroeconomic stabilisation (Section 
4). In t
his respect, Box 2 provides
 a model
-based quantification of the effectiveness of automatic stabilisers at the euro 
area level under normal conditions and 
under conditions 
akin to the 
lockdown phase of 
the 
COVID
-19 crisis. Overall, both the 
depth 
and the 
nature of the COVID
-19 crisis 
provide a strong rationale for additional fiscal measures
, as decided and implemented 
at the national and European level. In this context, the article discusses policy 
proposals to establish quasi
-automatic fiscal instruments th
at could provide additional 
timely, targeted and temporary macroeconomic stabilisation for the euro area
. The 
article also reflects on important efficiency considerations over the cycle, 
and the need 
to build 
fiscal 
buffers in good 
economic 
times 
(Section 
5). 
An overall conclusion can be 
found in Section 6
. 2 Elements of a
utomatic stabilis
ation in the government budget 
balance
 Faced with a recessionary shock, governments can provide support to the 
economy in 
different
 ways.
 Most noticeably, governments can de
cide to take 
discretionary fiscal policy measures. Typical discretionary measures include policies 
to boost household 
and firm 
confidence
, and 
consumption
 and investment 
opportunities
. They may also include,
 among many others things, tax rate cuts, higher
 tax allowances
, car scrapping schemes
 and support for 
private investment 
programmes. Governments can also decide to 
provide
 guarantees (or other forms of 
implicit and explicit contingent liabilities), e.g. to 
provide liquidity support to the 
economy, preve
nting
 severe supply side disruptions or contagion through financial 
channels. Less noticeably
, most 
government revenues
, and part of government 
expenditures
, also adjust automatically with the economy cycle and without any 
specific action from the governme
nt. Even less obviously, the government contributes 
implicitly to mitigating 
the repercussions of a negative macroeconomic shock
 by 
keeping a large part of its expenditure at the budgeted level, and not cutting it in a 
recession
. Automatic fiscal stabilisers refer to 
those 
elements 
built
 into the government 
budget 
that reduce fluctuations in economic activity
 without the need for 
discretionary actions
. The first source of automatic stabilisation is found in those 
elements of the go
vernment budget that react to the economic cycle. We will refer to 
these components of the budget balance as cyclical elements of the 
automatic fiscal 
stabilisers
. The second source is found in non
-cyclical components of the budget 
balance (mainly in the f
orm of public spending) which are characterised by relatively 
high inertia and can also be considered to provide automatic stabilisation. We will refer 
to these components of the budget balance as the non
-cyclical, implicit elements of 
the 
automatic fiscal
 stabilisers
.87 While this article will focus on 
recessionary shock
s 
Œ such as the one presented by the COVID
-19 crisis 
Œ in principle automatic fiscal 
stabilisers operate in both directions. They cushion the macroeconomic impact of a 
                                                                 87  These 
are often referred to the size of government or expenditure inertia in the literature.

determines government revenue and spending; for example, the number of 
unemployed persons in the case of unemployment benefits 
Œ and react 
immediately t
o a shock
. On the revenue side, 
the
 drop 
in tax and social security 
contributions, alongside increasing transfers to households, are the
 source of 
automatic stabilisation that most economists will have in mind
. However, this 
drop in revenues can be further
 broken down into two elements: (i) the 
proportional drop in revenues with respect to GDP as taxes and contributions of 
households and firms drop in line with their income 
Œ this can reduce economic 
fluctuations compared to, for example, a counterfactual s
cenario with a poll or 
lump
-sum tax;
88 and (ii) the
 progressivity of the tax system
 typically implies that 
revenues decline in excess of the drop in GDP, e.g. as households fall into a 
lower tax bracket in the personal income tax system. Tax progressivity i
s 
considered to have an important stabilisation effect on demand in case of a 
negative income shock, as 
personal income taxes 
play an important role in 
reducing volatility of disposable income
.89 On the expenditure side, 
unemployment benefits
 represent the most relevant automatic stabiliser of this 
type
.90  Second, the budget balance also provides implicit stabilisation via 
non
-cyclical 
items, particularly on the spending side.
 Governments
 typically 
do not significantly reduce their spending lev
el (i.e. in millions of euro) in times of 
a temporary economic downturn. 
Th
is inertia in government expenditure helps 
stabilis
e total output in a downturn 
because
 the bulk of go
vernment expenditure 
already approved 
Œ such as wages, transf
ers or intermediat
e consumption 
Œ does not react to 
the drop in 
output.
 In the
 counterfactual
, the government would 
reduce its expenditure to keep its budget balance unchanged in reaction to the 
economic slowdown. This would imply no stabilisation. The
 size of the 
governmen
t is
 thus often considered a proxy for the
 size of automatic fiscal 
stabilisers in a country. It should be noted that the 
size of the government 
also 
contributes to dampening an overheating economy, given that budgeted public 
expenditures are not immediate
ly increased in times of an economic upswing. 
Research shows that there is 
a negative relationship between government size 
                                                                 88  A poll tax is 
a tax levied as a fixed sum on 
a taxable
 individua
l, household or other entity.
 89  The degree of personal income tax progressivity is found to be negati
vely associated with output volatility 
in a sample of OECD countries. The effect 
is 
in addition to the stabilising role of 
a government
™s size. See

 90  Some authors argue that age and health

manner. 
This is, for example, because the propensity of older employees to enrol in early retirement 
schemes increases in a cyclical downturn.

 Governments provide

support to the economy, which is

 the change in the general government budget balance as 
a share of GDP. Th
is total 
fiscal 
support
 through the budget

two main 
categories

discretionary and 
the cyclical component

balance (green and blue bars respectively).

automatic fiscal stabilisers

The red bar is a counterfactual scenario where th

 Automatic

 largest positive long
-term impact (such as productive governmen
t investment)
 Œ may 
only be implemented with lags
. Furthermore, governments may find it difficult to 
reverse
 spending hikes 
after the crisis subsides
. Automatic fiscal stabilisers have the 
advantage of providing fiscal support
: (i) as the downturn occurs a
nd without delay 
(this is the 
ﬁtimelyﬂ
 aspect
); (ii) to those entities that require it most (
the 
ﬁtargetedﬂ
 aspect
); and (iii) only
 for
 as long as is needed (the ﬁtemporaryﬂ aspect).
 While automatic fiscal stabilisers provide benefits in terms of macroecon
omic 
stabilisation
, they
 may also have costs in terms of 
economic 
efficiency
. As 
described above, l
arge automatic fiscal stabilisers
 are associated with large 
government revenues and expenditures as a share of GDP
 and a progressive tax 
system. As pointed o
ut by the literature, since taxes generally distort economic 
decisions, v
ery
 large governments can be a drag on (potential) growth, especially 
when accompanied by high public debt ratios. When 
assessing tax structure effects on 
output volatility,
 there is 
evidence that 
for high ratios of total taxes to GDP further 
tax 
increases can be 
economically 
destabilising
.93 Moreover, automatic stabilisers can 
cushion temporary shocks, while their effectiveness is limited when it comes to 
persistent or permanent shocks
.94 In such cases, automatic stabilisers
 may lead to
 increasing 
government 
debt and induce risks to fiscal sustainability. Other types of 
measures and policies, especially structural reforms (including on the fiscal side) are 
needed to deal with these 
long
-term or permanent shocks.
 3 Estimating the size of automatic fiscal stabilisers in euro area 
countries
 To estimate the size of automatic stabili
sers, 
a microeconomic, 
a macroeconomic 
or a
 statistical 
approach
 can be used
.95 The 
microeconomic 
approach 
est
imates the extent to which a shock to household
 market income 
translates into 
a change in disposable income, using micro data on the
 tax and 
benefits system. The macroeconomic 
method
 additionally
 takes into account 
feedback effects and 
the 
behavioural resp
onses of economic agents
 Œ it 
quantifies the 
stabilising impact of fiscal policy on total income. Finally, the statistical approach 
evaluates the automatic stabilisation effect
 of a budget balance 
in terms of changes in 
economic activity. It
 considers not 
only stabilisation properties 
related to
 the size of the 
governmen
t Œ as measured by public expenditure 
ratio 
Œ but also direct taxes paid by 
households, indirect taxes and transfers. 
The latter
 approach captur
es the cyclical 
                                                                 93  For the growth impact, several OECD studies, inter alia, point to evidence that 
too large governments
 Œ on either the tax side or the expenditure side 
Œ tend to reduce growth unless governments function in a 
highly effect
ive way
. See, for example, Johansson Å., ﬁ
Public Finance, Economic Growth and Inequality
: A Survey of the Evidenceﬂ, 
OECD Economics Department Working Papers
, No. 1346, OECD Publishing, 
Paris
, 2016
. In addition to the growth impact, some studies 
provide ev
idence
 for nonlinear
 effects of 
government size on output volatility
, i.e. the macroeconomic stabilisation effects of governments decline, 
or even vanish, when their size is very large. See, for instance,

 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the COVID
-19 crisis
  120 component of the budget balanc
e (in 
percentage
 of GDP) 
and is the most 
widely 
used
 approach
 in institutional fiscal 
surveillance.
 This section focuses on the statistical approach and therefore estimates the 
size of 
automatic
 fiscal
 stabilisers as the
 part of the budget balance that 
aut
omatically adjusts to the economic cycle.
96 The statistical approach can 
capture both elements of the automatic stabilisers discussed in Section 2. When the 
elasticities of revenues and cyclical expenditures to the output gap are used, 
automatic fiscal stab
ilisers are estimated as changes in cyclical budgetary items.
97 If the focus is shifted to the elasticities of revenues and expenditures as a ratio to GDP 
(the concept of semi
-elasticities
98), the statistical approach delivers an estimate of the 
size of 
automatic fiscal stabilisers
, focusing mainly on the stabilising effect of the inert 
public expenditures and, to a lesser extent, on the
 other components of a budget 
balance. These react non
-proportionally to the economic cycle, e.g. income tax 
progressivi
ty induces tax revenues to grow faster than GDP.
 The ESCB method of estimating the cyclical component uses the concept of 
semi
-elasticity to gauge 
the reaction of the 
budget 
balance
-to-GDP ratio to 
cyclical conditions
.99 In this approach the budgetary semi
-elasticity is measured as 
the difference between semi
-elasticities of revenue and expenditure components. 
Semi
-elasticities of the relevant budgetary categories are estimated considering both 
a response of the budgetary category to its macroeconomic base a
nd a reaction of the 
base to the output gap.
100 One of 
the
 main 
novelt
ies of the ESCB method
 is the 
incorporation of 
the 
lagged response of a budget to macroeconomic shocks.
 Potential 
lagged collection of the revenues and lagged responses of macroeconomic ba
ses to 
the cycle, e.g. a lagged reaction of wages to the business cycle, not only result in a 
contemporaneous change of the budget balance as a reaction to the economic cycle 
but also contribute to further adjustments in later years.
 According to ESCB 
estimates, the standardised cumulative size of automatic 
stabiliser is 0.48 in the euro area but there is a large heterogeneity among the 
euro area countries (Chart 2).
101,102 In general, a
cross all countries, the bulk of 
                                                                 96  The automatic reaction of a budget balance can be estimated using two different approaches, namely, 
the aggregate approach or the disaggregate approach. The aggregate approach uses one synthetic 
measure of an economic cycle, i.e. the output gap, and appl
ies it to all budget items. In the disaggregate 
approach cyclical patterns are identified separately for all budget balance components. The aggregate 
method is currently used by all major international institutions, including the ESCB, to estimate the 
cyclical component of a budget balance.
 97  Cyclical revenues increase in a boom and decrease in a recession, while the opposite relationship occurs 
for cyclical expenditure.
 98  Budget s
emi
-elasticity measures the change of the budget balance, as a percent
age of GDP, for a 1% 
change in the output gap.

. 100  The macroeconomic base determines the amount of revenues collected and expenditures made by a 
government. For example, all goods and services that are subject to tax comprise a tax base. Due to the 
fact that exact bases are difficult to measure 
and forecast, proxy variables are used as macroeconomic 
bases, e.g. household consumption is a proxy base for VAT revenues.
 101  In general the size of automatic stabilisers is estimated as a semi
-elasticity multiplied by an output gap. 
Hence, the size of au
tomatic stabilisers is proportional to the size of an output gap. To improve 
comparability of results, it is assumed that an output gap equals 1% of potential GDP in all euro area 
countries.

 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the COVID

  121 automatic stabilisation is provided by
 non-cyclical expenditures, i.e. reflecting spending 
inertia. The amount of stabilisation is larger in the western European countries such as 
Belgium or France, while it is noticeably smaller in the central and eastern European 
countries, e.g. Slovakia or 
Latvia. The larger size of automatic fiscal stabilisers in 
western and, to some extent, southern European countries is a consequence of three 
main factors: (i) larger size of government; (ii) more generous social security system; 
and (iii) more progressive
 direct taxes. The generosity of unemployment benefits partly 
explains the observed cross
-country differences in the contribution of this expenditure to 
the overall semi
-elasticity, which is marginal in central and eastern European countries 
and largest in
 the case of Belgium. Other aspects of automatic fiscal stabilisers are the 
progressivity of tax systems and the cyclicality of social security contributions. For 
example, even if the progressivity of tax systems is comparable among countries, the 
stabilis
ation properties of personal income tax could still differ due to the existence of 
collective wage bargaining, which could increase wage rigidity. Relative stability of 
wages and employment, as well as a tendency of households to smoothen their 
consumption
 over the business cycle, can partly explain the negative impact of cyclical 
revenues in some countries, such as Germany or Italy.

 Notes: 
The 
size of au
tomatic 
stabilisers is estimated
 as 
a semi
-elasticity multiplied by 
a standardised 
output gap
 of 1% of potential GDP. 
Due to the fact that the ESCB method incorporates the 
lagged response of a budget to macroeconomic shocks
 and the lagged effect of 
tax collections
, the presented automatic stabilisers are expressed in cumulative terms over three years (T 
Œ T+2)
. The euro area average 
is indicatively calculated as a weighted average of individual semi
-elasticities for all euro area countries, using nominal GDP in 201
9. Automatic 
fiscal 
stabilisers 
during the COVID
-19 crisis 
are expected to be 
sizeable 
on in the
 euro area 
as a consequence of the significant size of the 
shock.
 Automatic 
stabilisers are forecasted to account for around one
-third of the 
large budget defic
it in 2020, namely 2.8% out of 8.5% 
of GDP
. This rises to 5.2% of 
                                                                                                                        102  To simplify the analysis and ensure comparability of results w

 Note
: The ESCB method of estimating semi
-elasticities incorporates t
he lagged response of a budget to macroeconomic shocks
 and lagged effect of tax collections. Therefore, the projected output gap cannot be inferred on the basis of values presented in 
Chart 2 and 
Chart 3.
 In the wake of a severe economic downturn, the prec
ision of the estimated size 
of automatic stabilisers should be carefully assessed.
 First, the estimation of the 
cyclical component relies on one synthetic measure of the business cycle, i.e. the 
output gap, which is surrounded by uncertainty, notably in re
al time.
104 Second, the 
nature of the initial shock may lead to differentiated reaction from the main 
macroeconomic bases used for the fiscal revenues. Third, as semi
-elasticities are 
estimated based on the past data, these reflect the typical reaction of a general 
government budget to economic cyclical fluctuations. In the current crisis, the unusual 
nature of the initial shock, its size and its implication for different macroeconomic 
variables invite prudency regarding the estimated size of the automatic stabilisers
.                                                                  103  In the literature, the year

automatic stabilisers. See for instance

  123 Box 
1  Comparison of
 estimates of 
automatic fiscal stabiliser
s Prepared by Carolin Nerlich and Kamila S
awi
ska The literature
 offers rather different estimates of the size of automatic stabilisers for the euro area. 
This box compar
es the ESCB estimates with those of other studies for both the euro area aggregate 
and across euro area countries. The results are then put into perspective by both looking at estimates 
of automatic fiscal stabilisers in the United States, and briefly touc
hing upon differences in the US 
institutional settings.
 For the euro area aggregate, the estimates of automatic fiscal stabilisers differ across studies. This 
differentiation results from: (i) differences in approaches to the estimation process; (ii) the u
nderlying 
source of automatic fiscal stabilisers, as discussed in chapter 2; and (iii) the relevant time horizon under 
consideration. The European Commission™s estimate is 0.56 for the euro area,
105 which is higher than 
the estimates from the ESCB and the OE
CD (which stand at 0.48 and 0.54, respectively).
106 All three 
institutions use the same measurement concept, i.e. semi
-elasticities. Nevertheless, the results may not 
be fully comparable due to the lagged responses that are included in the ESCB method. In co
ntrast, 
estimates of automatic stabilisers from Dolls et al. (based on a microsimulation approach) are lower.
107 In this study, the size of the automatic stabiliser is derived by estimating the response in households™ 
disposable income following a market inc
ome shock and an unemployment shock. For the euro area, 
the results for the income stabilisation coefficient are 0.38 and 0.42, respectively.

 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the COVID
-19 crisis
  124 Looking at the euro area countries, 
estimates of automatic
 fiscal
 stabilisers vary widely across 
countries
 and studies
. The e
stimate
d size by the ESCB ranges from
 0.66 in Belgium to around 0.35 in 
Slovakia (see Chart A)
. Compared to the ESCB figures, estimates by the European Commission are 
higher for the majority of co
untries, most notably for Germany, Estonia, Cyprus and the Netherlands, 
but considerably lower for Luxembourg. Similarly, OECD estimates are mostly higher than those of 
the ESCB, notably in Germany, Estonia and Spain.
 Compared to euro area countries, autom
atic fiscal stabiliser estimates appear to be much smaller for 
the United States. For the United States, most estimates point to a size of around 0.3 to 0.4.
108 The lower 
size of automatic stabilisers 
in the United States compared to the euro area results, i
n particular, from
 the smaller
 size of the government, 
a less progressive personal income
 tax structure 
and a less generous benefit system
. Consequently, 
the 
income 
stabilisation effect following
, for 
example
, an unemployment shock is 
estimated to be 
consi
derably lower in the 
United States
 than in 
the euro area.

 might be 
less effective 
because 
of 
the 
strict fiscal frameworks, including the requirements for balanced budget, established in the 
majority of 
US states.
110 In fact, these balanced budget rules were found to 
react 
in a 
pro
cyclical
 manner, 
therefore 
largely offsetting 
the stabilising effect 
at the federal level.
111  4 The 
effectiveness
 of automatic fiscal stabilisers for 
macroeconomic stabilisation
 Automatic fiscal stabilisers
 typically 
translate into the effective cushioning of 
economic fluctuation
s by stabilising aggregate demand.
 The
 degree to which 
these automatic fiscal stabilisers translate into demand stabilisation depends
 on the 
behaviour of e
conomic agents
. Households™
 propensity to consume plays an important 
role.
 Whether
 and how 
individuals
 adjust their consumption to fluctuations in their 
disposable income depends on the share of liquidity
-constrained
 and credit
-constrained households. Only
 households limited in their ability to borrow in the 
market reduce their spending 
one-for
-one in reaction to 
a temporary fall in income, 
while 
an income shock does not affect
 the
 consumption behaviour of households 
without liquidity 
constraints.
 Model sim
ulations for the euro area suggest that automatic fiscal stabilisers 
cushion around 10 to 30% of 
a standard
 GDP shock
 (see Box 2)
. That is, the euro 
                                                                 108  The US Congressional Budget Office estimates the automatic stabiliser in the US at, on average, 0.3% of 
potential GDP since 1970. See Russek, F. and

 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers 
in the euro area and the COVID
-19 crisis
  125 area aggregate automatic fiscal stabiliser of 0.48 implies that between 10% and 30% 
of a standardised shock
 to the economy is cushioned. The bounds of this range of 
estimates are determined first and foremost by which elements of automatic fiscal 
stabilisation are included in the analysis. Including only the cyclical elements of 
automatic stabilisation reduces 
the macroeconomic stabilisation significantly vis
-à-vis 
an analysis that also includes the (larger) non
-cyclical elements of 
automatic 
stabilisation
. Further modelling uncertainty arises from the state
-dependent nature of 
economic variables. For example, t
he share of liquidity
-constrained households is not 
independent of the state of the economy and 
may 
increase 
during a crisis.
 Most estimates of the 
output smoothing 
effect 
of automatic 
fiscal 
stabilisers in 
advanced economies
 fall within the range presente
d in this article.
 Estimates
 depend on the source of the initial shock (
e.g.
 external v
ersus
 domestic 
demand
). In 
general, an export
-led shock is less tax
-rich and, thus, less stabilised
 by the budget in 
most models. A
utomatic stabilisers tend to absorb a 
private consumption shock much 
more strongly than a private investment shock and an export shock.
112 Estimates also 
depend on the model
-specific budget elasticities (reaction of budget components to 
macroeconomic bases) and the embedded fiscal multipliers (r
eaction of output to a 
fisca
l shock).
113 In addition, estimates depend, not least, on the definition of automatic 
fiscal stabilisers 
used
 (which determines the
 counterfactual
 scenario without 
automatic fiscal stabilisers
). 
According to the cyclical view of a
utomatic fiscal 
stabilisers, in which taxes and transfers to households 
play the stabilising role, the 
degree of output smoothing after the shock is found
 to be
 at around 
9% to 
17%. 
For a 
size
-of-government view of automatic fiscal stabilisers
, assuming th
at 
mostly 
the 
expenditure side plays the stabilising role, the degree of output smoothing is found 
to 
be at 25% to 
27%.
114 The
 nature of the economic shock has implications for the
 effectiveness of 
automatic fiscal stabilisers.
 The 
contraction 
in the COVID
-19 crisis is not only 
faster
, and its magnitude greater
, than during the 
great 
financial
 crisis
, but the current 
downturn is also of a different nature than in the past. Historically, recessions typically 
result from economic and financial imbalances
. The correction 
of these imbalances
 is 
associated with a drop in economic
 aggregate 
demand on account of price and 
income adjustments, and 
on account of 
economic uncertainty. 
In this situation, a 
stabilisation of household income through the tax and benefit syst
em in particular can 
help prop up economic demand. 
By contrast, the COVID
-19 crisis is largely an 
                                                                 112  See, for instance,

. The authors 
use the 
Deutsche 
Bundesbank™s BbkM model

investment shock at 15%
; and
 of 
exports at 13%. In the same setting, using the QUEST model, they find 
a maximum smoothing power of 24%, 13%, and 14%
, respectively.
 113  Regarding fiscal multipliers (directly relevant in the context of discretionary measures), most 
model
-based estimates
 for 
a one-year temporary fiscal shock with no monetary policy ac
commodation 
hover around 1 for expenditure items such as government consumption and investment and are much 
lower, i.e. between 0.2
 and 
0.4 for general transfers and (direct and indirect) tax
es.
 114  For the euro area, two 
analyses from 2002 and 2017 
using the QUEST model
, find estimates of output 
smoothing of 13
% to 
17% for the first benchmark and 
of 
26% to 
27% for the second, concluding that 
dampening of cyclical fluctuations through the inert
ia of discretionary spending largely exceeds the 
smoothing effect of tax revenue.

 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the COVID
-19 crisis
  126 exogenous shock with strong repercussions
 not only
 for demand but also for supply in 
the economy. In the first phase of the crisis, governments introduced sev
ere 
restrictions on social and economic activities to contain the spread of the virus. 
This
 put severe constraints on the supply side of the economy, where, for example, border 
closures disrupted global supply chains, factory closures exhausted product 
sto
ckpiles and the lockdown curtailed high
-street retail. 
As a result, income 
stabilisation, supported by both automatic stabilisers and discretionary government 
measures, have not translated into stabilising consumption and investment to the 
same extent as i
n past downturns but have instead led to a temporary increase in the 
private sector™s saving rate. For example, household c
onsumption stabilisation 
was 
temporarily inhibited
, as even liquidity
-constrained 
households
 were 
forced to change 
their consumption 
behaviour
 and increase their savings rate.
 At the same time
, governments in some countries were 
forced
 to suspend 
their 
investments due to
, among others things,
 restricti
ons that were 
introduced
 on the movement of people.
 As the lockdown 
lifts
 in most euro
 area countries, automatic fiscal stabilisers 
should regain their normal effectiveness
. On the one hand, as much of the 
supply
-side and lockdown restrictions on the economy are lifted, households are 
expected to consume the part of the disposable income th
ey were forced to save 
during the lockdown. Private and government investment that might have been 
impaired during that phase are also expected to resume. On the other hand, even if 
the precautionary saving motive related to the large uncertainty induced b
y the crisis 
may persist for longer, the presence of automatic fiscal stabilisers (and other 
supporting government measures) should cushion such effects.
 It should be noted that the COVID
-19 crisis may leave a lasting mark on the size 
of fiscal stabilisers
. Tax bases and spending profiles may have shifted with the 
structure of the economy or in the social security system. For example, the COVID
-19 
crisis could in many countries act as a catalyst for a quicker digitalisation, which in turn 
may result in chan
ges in the employment structure 
of the economy
. Some measures 
implemented by governments 
Œ such as short
-term work schemes 
Œ may remain in 
place after the crisis, which could have a lasting positive impact on 
the effectiveness of 
automatic fiscal stabilise
rs in stabilising the economy

 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the COVID
-19 crisis
  127 also attempt to recreate the characteristics of the COVID
-19 crisis related to the effects of the 
lockdown measures that might reduce the effectiveness of automatic stabilisers.
 This box employs the semi
-elasticities presented in Section 3
. That is, assuming a standardised 
negative GDP shock (opening of the output gap by 1 percentage point in year T), the euro area 
budget balance
-to-GDP ratio is estimated to fall
 cumulatively by 0.48 percentage points over a three 
year period (from T to T+2
 Œ see Chart 2), out of which 0.35 percentage points in the year of the shock 
(T). We focus on the output smoothing effects upon impact (T), which are the most relevant in size 
given the temporary nature of the stabilisers.
116 In terms of the modelling appro
ach, we construct 
fiscal shocks o
n the basis of the semi
-elasticities
 mentioned above and their disaggregation by 
components 
(th
ose which have a
 direct impact on demand)
, which we then feed into the 
macroeconomic models to gauge the output effect.
 Followin
g the model
-based literature, we evaluate the degree of automatic stabilisation in relation to 
benchmark scenarios of ﬁno automatic stabilisersﬂ.
 The results for 
two
 scenario
s, reflecting the two 
main aspects of 
automatic fiscal 
stabilisers in the literatu
re as touched upon in Section 2,
 and their 
average (
taken as the 
overall proxy
 for output stabilisation
) are presented in Chart A.
  Scenario 1 reflects 
the counter
cyclical
 aspect 
of 
automatic fiscal stabilisers (changes of budget 
balance in 
levels
), taking 
account of those budgetary components that are sensitive to the cycle, 
such as changes in taxes and unemployment benefits. In the construction of this scenario, we 
map the fiscal instruments into shocks on the labour income tax rate, the consumption tax ra
te 
and government transfer to households.
117  Scenario 2 reflects the government size/expenditure inertia aspect of automatic stabilisers 
(changes of budget balance in 
ratios to GDP
). In the construction of this scenario, the shocks are 
implemented as changes
 to government consumption, investment and transfers (other than 
unemployment benefits) following their respective budgetary shares.
 The contribution of fiscal automatic stabilisers to output cushioning is calculated as the real GDP 
effect in these two sce
narios relative to the standardised initial shock.
118                                                                  116  On the re
venue side, we also consider the lag effects from T+1 and T+2 in the simulation.
 117  Adjusting the semi
-elasticities in Section 3 to measure elasticities of the revenue and expenditure levels 
rather than elasticities of the ratios to GDP gives an estimated 
budget balance deterioration in year T of 
0.33 percentage points.
 118  This is broadly equivalent with another counterfactual scenario, in which we would determine the ex
-ante 
fiscal shock needed to offset the budget balance impact of the automatic stabilise
rs, and then we would 
estimate the real GDP impact of such a shock. The relative difference between this impact and the initial 
shock would give the output smoothing of automatic stabilisers.

 A Output smoothing of euro area automatic stabilisers
 Sources: 
ECB calculations.
 Notes: The degree of output smoothing is calculated as the average percent deviation of the 
GDP level 
during the first year in a scenario with automatic 
stabilisers reaction relative to the percent deviation of the 
GDP leve
l in a scenario without AS reaction (counterfactual). For Scenario 1 the counterfactual with no 
fiscal stabilisation is a scenario in w
hich 
government revenue and expenditure are fixed 
(the counter
cyclical
 view of 
automatic stabilisers). In Scenario 2 
the 
counterfactual
 is a scenario in which
 revenue and expenditure are kept constant in ratios to GDP
 (mostly the expenditure inertia). Pric
e effects are not reflected 
in the construction of the standardised shocks under automatic stabilisers in any of the scenarios (standardised or with cris
is adjustment). The results for 
Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 are the model averages of the output smoothin
g obtained from simulations using the BMEs and NMCM. In the scenarios with 
COVID
-19 restriction proxies, simulations reflect increased savings ratios by 
reduci
ng the model
-implied propensities
 to consume
. For the BMEs the simulations 
of the increased savin
g ratio do not take into account general equilibrium effects but only the direct effect of lower consumption on real GDP grow
th.
 Turning to the COVID
-19 crisis, given the extreme uncertainty associated with the shock and its 
macroeconomic (supply versus de
mand) and fiscal effects, we use 
illustrative 
adjustments to mimic 
the conditions of the crisis and gauge the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of automatic 
stabilisers. 
To illustrate the impact of the unprecedented 
COVID
-19 lock
down
 measures,
 we consider 
an increase in savings (both forced and precautionary), in line with 
estimations from
 the early stages 
of the crisis. We evaluate this alternative scenario by reducing the model
-implied
 propensity to 
consume
, in line with 
the savings
-ratio inc
rease. 
As a result, fiscal instruments supporting 
households™ disposable income have a lower effect on consumption profiles. 
In addition, we slightly 
adjust the counterfactual on the expenditure side
, i.e. 
government investment
, which is likely to be 
most 
affected by 
lockdown measures.
119 Altogether, this
 leads to a smaller implied automatic fiscal 
stabilisation contribution
, as shown in Chart A. Averaging across the models and scenarios, the 
smoothing of automatic fiscal stabilisers declines from around 20% 
to 17% in year T. There is a larger 
relative effect for Scenario 1, where the effectiveness of automatic fiscal stabilisers drops by almost 
25%, given that mostly transfers and taxes are considered
, which are strongly affected by the
 increase in the saving
 ratio.
120 These estimates are surrounded by high uncertainty. First, there is model
-related uncertainty implying 
fiscal multiplier uncertainty. On the one hand, the literature points to evidence of larger fiscal 
multipliers during recessions, as well as in 
a low interest rate environment. On the other hand, 
particularly in high
-debt countries, 
fiscal
 multipliers are found to be lower and the effectiveness of 
automatic stabilisers may be reduced through Ricardian effects and the anticipation of future 
consoli
dation needs.
 Second, there is uncertainty regarding the cyclical adjustment method, as 
described in Section 3. Third, and most importantly, the estimates of both the size and the 
                                                                 119  See the 
June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
 and the euro area 
sectoral accounts for Q1 2020, which both point to increased households savings. The Q1 2020 sectora
l accounts also point to a deceleration in government investment growth. 
 120  It should be noted that a more persistent shock with larger consequences on potential output than 
currently assumed would reduce both the size and the effectiveness of automatic s
tabilisers.

 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the COVID
-19 crisis
  129 effectiveness of automatic stabilisers during the COVID
-19 crisis are partic
ularly uncertain, given the 
unprecedented nature of the crisis in the euro area. Moreover, these model exercises rely on proxies 
for calibration and only partially reflect the possible channels through which the efficiency of fiscal 
stabilisation could be 
altered during the COVID
-19 crisis (see Section 4).
  5 Towards a second generation of automatic fiscal stabilisers
 The 
COVID
-19 crisis 
gives cause
 to re
view
 the role of fiscal policy
 in a severe 
economic downturn
. On the one hand, monetary policy remains close to the 
effective lower bound, which would motivate a stronger role for fiscal policy.
121 On the 
other hand, traditional automatic fiscal stabilisers might be too small to counterbalance 
the sharp economic downt
urn and less effective than under normal circumstances. 
Also, 
automatic fiscal stabilisers 
are quite heterogeneous across euro area countries 
in terms of size and composition. At the same time, discretionary policy measures may 
react too slowly to sufficie
ntly cushion a massive economic downturn, such as the one 
experienced as a result of the pandemic, and avoid hysteresis effects. These 
considerations have led to 
proposals to 
strengthen 
quasi
-automatic fiscal 
instruments.
122 So-called second generation autom
atic fiscal stabilisers could help deliver 
more timely, targeted and sizeable policy responses.
 In contrast to traditional 
automatic fiscal stabilisers
, which are mostly a by
-product of the structure and 
size
-of-government revenue
s and expenditures, second
 generation 
automatic fiscal 
stabilisers
 Œ also referred to as ﬁasymmetricﬂ or ﬁquasi
-automaticﬂ 
fiscal stabilisers 
Œ are fiscal tools specifically designed and implemented to provide macroeconomic 
stabilisation. Second
-generation automatic stabilisers wor
k as programmes that only 
turn active when the economy heads into deep recession and automatically revert to 
normal levels once specific indicators are back to pre
-crisis levels. They are automatic 
in that their activation is rules
-based rather than subjec
t to a government decision. In 
contrast to traditional automatic stabilisers, they are asymmetric in that they are 
activated only in case of a severe downturn of the economy.
123 Two types of asymmetric
 automatic
 fiscal 
stabilisers can be 
identified
, dependin
g on whether they work via public expenditure or 
via 
revenues.
 First, 
on the expenditure side, asymmetric automatic fiscal stabilisers can mainly help to 
                                                                 121  Fiscal multipliers are conventionally higher when monetary policy reaches the lower bound. See, for

 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the COVID
-19 crisis
  130 stabilise household spending, e.g. through higher or longer individual unemployment 
benefit or social 
assistance payments once a certain pre
-defined threshold is 
reached.
124 Short
-time work schemes that activate in deep recessions are a notable 
example. Alternatively, 
asymmetric automatic fiscal stabilisers 
can work directly 
through higher government spendin
g, e.g. on infrastructure investment projects.
125 Second, asymmetric stabilisers that work via the revenue side can influence the timing 
of household spending through intertemporal substitution effects. Typical examples 
are temporary tax deferrals or tax cre
dits, such as a temporary decrease in the VAT 
rate to boost consumption in the short run.
126 The design of 
quasi
-automatic
 fiscal
 stabilisers 
influences their effectiveness
. Crucial choices relate to the economic indicators and the threshold that triggers th
e activation of the programme, as well as the design of the spending programmes or 
temporary tax cuts. For asymmetric stabilisers via unemployment benefit payments, 
Blanchard and Summers suggest basing the trigger on the unemployment rate rather 
than on ou
tput movements, as the latter might also be driven by shocks related to 
potential output.
127 If well
 designed, asymmetric 
automatic fiscal 
stabilisers 
could be 
a powerful 
instrument to effectively cushion a severe economic downturn.
 They are likely to 
be mor
e effective than traditional stabilisers in that they are specifically designed to 
provide macroeconomic stabilisation in a downturn. While asymmetric automatic 
stabilisers usually do not respond to normal cyclical developments, they are of a much 
larger s
cale once they are activated. As such, they do not contribute to a further, 
permanent increase of the size of the government. Using a stylised counterfactual 
analysis, Blanchard and Summers show that asymmetric automatic stabilisers can be 
successful in li
miting the impact of a recession, although the results are contingent on 
the role of discretionary measures and the length of the automatic stimulus period.
128 The IMF argues that countries with a relatively small tax and benefit system could 
benefit from th
e introduction of 
asymmetric 
automatic 
fiscal stabilisers
.129 At the same time, asymmetric automatic fiscal stabilisers do not come without 
limitations.
 This
 is for at least three reasons: (i
) they might lower incentives to take up 
necessary adjustments of the economy, in particular if a crisis results from the build
-up 
of economic and financial imbalances, as was the case during the financial crisis; (ii) 
due to the asymmetry embedded in thes
e instruments they do not automatically 
contribute to fiscal consolidation during good economic times, as countries have 
moved to a high debt trajectory during the downturn 
Œ to mitigate sustainability risk
s, it 
                                                                 124  For example, it was proposed that lump sum payments to individuals should be triggered automatically 
when the th

ed in practice
. In the United States, the length of unemployment benefit 
payments automatically increases as soon as the unemployment rate exceeds a 
certain threshold. Also social payments in kind, such as food stam
ps, automatically 
rise once a threshold is hit.
 During
 the COVID
-19 crisis, most euro area countries relied
, to a large extent
, on quasi
-automatic discretionary fiscal instruments, which closely resemble 
asymmetric 
automatic 
stabilisers.
 In particular, sho
rt-time work schemes as well as 
temporary tax deferrals and tax credits have been widely used.
130 Short
-time work 
schemes
 involve compensation payments, in the form of subsidies or grants to firms, 
that are contingent on firms not laying off workers who may 
otherwise have been made 
temporarily redundant due to the economic crisis. The aim is to 
limit households™ loss 
of income and firms™ wage costs. 
Short
-time work schemes already existed in several 
countries, notably in Germany, France and Belgium, although 
legislation was required 
for their activation and for the instrument to be stepped up.
131 The scheme was newly 
introduced in several countries during the COVID
-19 crisis. 
Tax deferrals and 
temporary VAT cuts have also been widely employed
 by most euro area c
ountries.
 6 Conclusions
 In normal times a
utomatic fiscal stabilisers play an importa
nt role for 
macroeconomic stabilisation
 in the euro area
. According 
to ESCB estimates, 
automatic fiscal stabilisers are generally sizeable in the euro area, but vary 
significantly across Member States.
 They are particularly sizeable in some western 
European countries, which typically have in place more generous transfer schemes 
and a larger size of the government sector. In normal times they seem sufficient to 
cushion 
between 10% and 30% of an economic shock.
 The effectiveness of automatic fiscal stabilisers in cushioning the economy is 
less apparent during the COVID
-19 crisis
, especially 
during
 the lockdown 
phase
. Due to 
the 
massive
 economic downturn
 experienced by the
 euro area, and 
with
 monetary policy 
close to
 the effective lower bound
, this
 gives cause to review the 
role of fiscal policy.
 So-called second generation automatic fiscal stabilisers could help 
deliver more timely, targeted and sizeable policy responses 
to preserve potential 
growth and avoid hysteresis effects.
 During the COVID
-19 crisis, m
ost euro area 
countries 
adopted measures 
aimed at protecting potential output by preserving those 
                                                                 130  Estimates for the five largest euro 
area countries indicate that indeed a substantial share of employees is 
on short
-time work or temporary lay
-off, ranging from 45% of total employees in France to 21% in the 
Netherlands. See the boxes entitled ﬁ

 Œ Articles
 Automatic
 fiscal stabilisers in the euro area and the COVID
-19 crisis
  132 economic structures expected to remain viable after the crisis. More sp
ecifically, 
authorities
 in some countries
 provided short
-time work schemes to keep employees in 
their jobs and offered liquidity support to firms to prevent them from going out of 
business.
 Looking ahead, there are strong arguments for 
efficient 
second gen
eration 
automatic fiscal stabilisers
 to play a more prominent role.
 The institutionalisation 
of 
asymmetric automatic fiscal stabilisers
 Œ such as a statutory
 short
-time work 
sche
mes 
Œ could provide for more macroeconomic stability without overburdening the 
government sector. 
However, such instruments would need to be well designed to 
ensure that incentive structures are in place. Moreover, to mitigate sustainability risk, it 
is 
important that all euro area countries 
build up fiscal buffer in good times.
