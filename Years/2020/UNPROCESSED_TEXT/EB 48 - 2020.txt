  2 Economic and monetary
 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 
10 December 2020
, the Governing Council 
decided
 to recalibrate its monetary policy instruments
. While the rebound 
in economic activity in the third quarter was stronger than expected and the prospects for 
the roll
-out of vaccines are encouraging, the 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) pandemic 
continues to pose se
rious risks to public health and to the euro area and global 
economies. The resurgence in COVID
-19 cases and the associated containment 
measures are significantly restricting euro area economic activity, which is expected to 
have contracted in the fourth q
uarter of 2020. While activity in the manufacturing 
sector continues to hold up well, services activity is being severely curbed by the 
increase in infection rates and the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility. 
Inflation remains very low in t
he context of weak demand and significant slack in 
labour and product markets. Overall, the incoming data and 
the December 2020 
Eurosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic 
projections suggest a more pronounced near
-term 
impact of the pandemic on the economy and a more 
protracted weakness in inflation 
than previously envisaged. 
Against this background, 
the Governing Council
 decided to
 recalibrate its monetary policy instruments 
at its meeting on 10 December 2020.
 Economic
 and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
10 December
 2020 The global economy rebound
ed strongly
 in the third quarter of 2020
 and this 
was followed by 
continued growth momentum at the start of the fourth quarter
, 
but headwinds 
cloud the near
-term economic outlook.
 While
 recent news about 
the development of effective vaccine
s against the coronavirus has sparked financial 
market optimism, the short
-term global economic outlook remains clouded by the 
pandemic. The s
ignificant rise in the number of new COVID
-19 infections, particularly 
in advanced economies, has 
led to
 the reintroduction of containment measures, 
although these 
measures 
are seen as less disruptive to economic activity than those 
implemented
 during the 
first wave of the pandemic. According to the December 2020 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, global real GDP (excluding the euro 
area) will contract by 3.0% this year and expand by 5.8% in 2021, before growing by 
3.9% and 3.6% in 2022 and 2023 re
spectively. Global trade (excluding the euro area) 
contracted more sharply than real GDP in 2020, but 
is expected to
 rebound 
more 
strongly 
in 2021. This primarily reflects the more pronounced procyclicality of trade, 
especially during economic downturns. T
hese adverse effects are expected to 
be less 
severe
 in the context of the recent resurgence in infections. The balance of risks 
around the global 
economic 
outlook is seen as less negative
 than previously 
expected
, as
, given 
the news about the viability of 
several vaccines
, it 
is less likely that 
the se
vere scenario will materialise.

 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
  3 Overall, f
inancial conditions in the euro area have
 loosened somewhat 
further 
since the Governing Council™s meeting in 
September 
2020, amid improved risk 
sentiment on the back o
f positive 
announcements about vaccines.
 Over
 the 
review period (10 September to 9 December 2020) the forward curve of the euro 
overnight index average (EONIA) fluctuated somewhat, but 
ultimately
 remained 
broadly unchanged. This reflects concerns about the
 accelerated spread of COVID
-19 in Europe set against positive 
news about 
vaccine
s. 
The curve
 continues to be 
inverted only slightly at the short end. Long
-term sovereign bond yields and spreads 
dropped significantly in the euro area
 over this period,
 amid
 expectations of continued 
monetary and fiscal support together with a global improvement in risk sentiment, 
triggered in particular by the news of successful vaccine trials. The prices of risk 
assets increased accordingly. In foreign exchange markets, the
 euro 
depreciated 
slightly in trade
-weighted terms.
 Following a sharp contraction in the first half of 2020, euro area real GDP 
rebounded strongly and rose by 12.5
%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter, 
although remaining well below pre
-pandemic level
s. The
 second wave of the 
pandemic and the associated intensification of containment measures observed since 
mid
-October are expected to result in a renewed significant decline in activity in the 
fourth quarter, although to a much lesser extent than observ
ed in the second quarter of 
this year.
 Economic developments continue to be uneven across sectors, with activity 
in the services sector being more adversely affected by the new restrictions on social 
interaction and mobility than activity in the industrial
 sector. Although fiscal policy 
measures are supporting households and firms, consumers remain cautious in the 
light of the pandemic and its ramifications for employment and earnings. Moreover, 
weaker 
corporate 
balance sheets and uncertainty about the econ
omic outlook are 
weighing on business investment.
 Looking ahead, 
recent advances in the 
development of COVID
-19 vaccines allow for greater confidence in the assumption of 
a gradual resolution of the health crisis. However, it will take time until widespread 
immunity is achieved, while further resurgences in infections, with challenges to public 
health and economic 
prospects, cannot be ruled out. Over the medium term, the 
recovery of the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing 
conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in demand as containment 
measures are 
lifted and uncertainty re
cedes.
 This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the December 
2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.
 These
 projections foresee annual real GDP growth at 
-7.3
% in 2020, 3.9
% in 2021, 4.2
% in 
2022 and 2.1
% in 2023. Compared with the September 2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity has been revised 
down
wards
 in the short term but is seen to broadly recover to the level projected in the 
September baseline scenario over the m
edium term. Overall, the risks surrounding the 
euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, but have become less 
pronounced. While the news about the prospects for vaccine roll
-outs is encouraging, 
downside risks remain related to the implicatio
ns of the pandemic for economic and 
financial conditions.
  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8 / 2020
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
  4 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual inflation remained 
unchanged at 
-0.3
% in November.
 On the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into 
account the temporary reduction in the 
German VAT rate, headline inflation is likely to 
remain negative until early 2021. Thereafter, it is expected to increase owing to the 
end of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany and upward base effects in energy 
price inflation. At the same time, underl
ying price pressures are expected to remain 
subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel
-related sectors, as 
well as to low wage pressures and the 
historically high level of the effective exchange 
rate of the euro
. Once the impact of the
 pandemic fades, a recovery in demand, 
supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will put upward pressure 
on inflation over the medium term. Market
-based indicators and survey
-based 
measures of longer
-term inflation expectations remain at lo
w levels.
 This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the December 
2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which 
foresees annual inflation at 0.2
% in 2020, 1.0
% in 2021, 1.1
% in 2022 and 1.4
% in 
2023. Compare
d with the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook for inflation has been revised down for 2020 and 2022.
 Annual 
HICP inflation 
excluding energy and food is expected to be 0.
7% in 2020
, 0.8% 
in 2021
 and 1.0% in 
2022, before increasi
ng to 1.
2% in 202
3. The 
coronavirus 
pandemic has continued to influence monetary dynamics in 
the euro area
. Broad
 money (M3) growth 
remained broadly unchanged at 10.5
% in 
October 2020
. 
Strong money growth has been supported by the ongoing asset 
purchases b
y the Eurosystem, which have become the largest source of money 
creation
. I
n the context of a still heightened preference for liquidity and a low 
opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of mon
ey, t
he narrow monetary 
aggregate M1 continues to be t
he main contributor to broad money growth.
 The 
growth of lending to the private sector has plateaued, while still recording higher 
growth rates than prior to the COVID
-19 pandemic.
 The annual growth rate of loans to 
non-financial corporations
 fell
 to 6.8
% in October, after 7.1
% in September
. 
This 
deceleration has occurred in the context of abating emergency liquidity needs, weak 
investment and tighter credit conditions on loans to firms
. 
The annual growth rate of 
loans to households 
stood at 3.1
% in Octobe
r, unchanged from September
. The 
Governing Council™s
 policy measures, 
together with the measures adopted by national 
governments and European institutions, 
remain essential 
to support 
bank lending 
conditions and 
access to financing, 
in particular for those
 most affected by the 
ramifications of the pandemic.
 Substantial fiscal support
 has mitigated the significant negative impact 
of the 
coronavirus pandemic 
on the real economy
. The fiscal cost of this support has 
been very substantial for all euro area count
ries, although it 
has 
varie
d markedly 
across countries. As a result of the economic downturn and the fiscal support, the 
general government budget deficit in the euro area is projected to increase 
significantly to 8.0% of GDP in 2020
 from 0.6% in 2019, acc
ording to the December 
2020 Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections. Thereafter, the deficit ratio is 
expected to decline to 6.1% of GDP in 2021
, 3.9% 
in 2022 
and 3.0% in 
2023. The 
improvement is expected to be led by the phasing
-out of the emergency 
containment

 Overview
  5 measures, while the cyclical component will only improve significantly from 2022. An 
ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp 
contraction in the euro area economy
, although fiscal measures should
 be targeted 
and temporary. At the same time, weak demand from firms and households and the 
heightened risk of a delayed recovery in the light of the new lockdowns owing to the 
second wave of the pandemic warrant continued support from national fiscal policies. 
The Nex
t Generation EU fund, which complements the fiscal measures 
implemented 
at the national level, will contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and 
will increase economic resilience and the growth potential of EU Member States™ 
economies, pa
rticularly if the funds are deployed for productive public spending and 
accompanied by productivity
-enhancing structural policies.
 The m
onetary policy 
package
 In view of the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic
 and the resulting
 protracted weakness in inflation
, 
on 10
 December
 2020 the Governing Council
 recalibrated its monetary policy instruments
 to 
preserve favourable financing 
conditions
 over the pandemic period
, ultimately 
support
ing
 economic activity and the 
robust convergen
ce of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2
% over the 
medium term.
 1. The Governing Council decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged. 
They 
are expected to remain at their present or lower levels until the inflation 
outlook robustly c
onverges to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2
% within 
the projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in 
underlying inflation dynamics.
 2. The Governing Council
 decided to increase the envelope of the pandemic 
emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) by •500 billion to a total of •1,850 
billion. 
It
 also extended the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least 
the end of March 2022. In any case, 
the Eurosystem
 will conduct net purchases 
until the Governing Council judg
es that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. 
The 
Eurosystem
 will conduct purchases under the PEPP to preserve favourable 
financing conditions over this extended period. 
It
 will purchase flexibly according 
to market conditions and with a view to preventing
 a tightening of financing 
conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the 
pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases 
over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will contin
ue to support 
the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions 
can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope 
over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. 
Equa
lly, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable 
financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of 
inflation.
 The extension of 
the 
PEPP purchases over a longer horizon reflects the 
prolonged fallout fro
m the pandemic for the economy and inflation. It allows for a 
continuous market presence and more durable support from 
the Governing 
Council™s
 monetary stimulus. Preserving favourable financing conditions over the

  6 pandemic period will help to reduce uncert
ainty and bolster confidence, thereby 
encouraging consumer spending and business investment, and, ultimately, 
underpinning the economic recovery and helping to offset the downward impact 
of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. 
Finally, the Gove
rning Council
 also decided to extend the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing 
securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, 
the future roll
-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with 
the appropriate monetary policy stance.
 3. The Governing Council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of the third 
series of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Specifically, 
it 
decided to extend the period over which considerabl
y more favourable terms will 
apply by twelve months, to June 2022. 
Furthermore, the Governing Council
 will 
conduct three additional operations between June and December 2021. 
Moreover, 
the Governing Council
 decided to raise the total amount that 
counterpar
ties will be entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations from 50
% to 55
% of their stock of eligible loans. In order to provide an incentive for banks to sustain 
the current level of bank lending, the recalibrated TLTRO III borrowing conditions 
will be made 
available only to banks that achieve a new lending performance 
target. The extension of the pandemic
-related low interest rate period under 
TLTRO III, the addition of more operations and the increase in the amount that 
can potentially be borrowed will pres
erve the very attractive funding conditions 
for banks. This will help to ensure that they can continue to offer favourable 
lending conditions and have ample liquidity to extend loans to households and 
firms
. 4. The Governing Council
 decided to extend to June 2022 the duration of the set of 
collateral easing measures adopted by the Governing Council on 7 and 22 April 
2020. The extension of these measures will continue to ensure that banks can 
make full use of the Eurosystem™s liquidit
y operations, most notably the 
recalibrated TLTROs. The Governing Council will reassess the collateral easing 
measures before June 2022, ensuring that Eurosystem counterparties™ 
participation in TLTRO III operations is not adversely affected.
 5. The Governing
 Council also decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency 
longer
-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) in 2021, which will continue to 
provide an effective liquidity backstop.
 6. Net purchases under 
the
 asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at 
a monthly pace of •20 billion. 
The Governing Council
 continue
s to expect monthly 
net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce 
the accommodative impact of 
the ECB™s
 policy rates, and to end shortly before 
the Governing Coun
cil start
s raising the key ECB interest rates. 
In addition, the 
Governing Council
 intend
s to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments 
from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time 
past the date when 
it start
s raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for 
as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample 
degree of monetary accommodation.

 Overview
  7 7. The Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) and all temporary swap 
and repo l
ines with non
-euro area central banks will be extended until March 
2022. 8. Finally, the Governing Council
 decided to continue conducting 
its
 regular lending 
operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at the prevailing 
conditions for as lo
ng as necessary.
 The monetary policy measures that the Governing Council has taken 
will contribute to 
preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby 
supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning eco
nomic 
activity and safeguarding medium
-term price stability. At the same time, uncertainty 
remains high, including with regard to the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of 
vaccine roll
-outs. 
The Governing Council
 will also continue to monitor developm
ents in 
the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium

inflation outlook. 
Therefore

 continue
s to stand ready to adjust 
all of 
its
 instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards 
its
 aim in a 
sustained manner, in line with 
its
 commitment to symmetry.

  8 1 External environment
 While recent developments regarding vaccines against the coronavirus (
COVID
-19) have sparked financial market optimism, the short
-term global economic outlook 
rem
ains clouded by the pandemic. The significant rise in the number of 
new 
COVID
-19 infections
, particularly
 in advanced economies
, has been met with the 
re-introduc
tion of 
containment measures
, although these are seen as less disruptive 
to economic activity 
than those observed during the first wave of the pandemic. 
According to the
 December 
2020 
Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projection
s, global
 real GDP (excluding the euro area) 
will 
contract by 
3.0
% this year
 and expand
 by 
5.8
% in 2021, before growing by 
3.9% and 3.6%
 in 202
2 and 2023 respectively.
 Global trade 
(excluding the euro area) has contracted more sharply than real GDP in 2020, but the 
rebound in 2021 is likewise expected to be stronger. This reflects mainly the more 
pronounced
 pro
cyclicality of tra
de, especially during economic downturns
. Moreover, 
the containment measures introduced in response to the resurgence of infections are 
expected to be less disruptive to trade than those observed in the first wave. The 
balance of risks around the global ou
tlook is seen as less negative, as the news about 
the viability of several vaccines makes it less likely that the severe scenario 
considered in the 
December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
 will 
mate
rialise. As the outcome of the Brexit nego
tiations remained uncertain when the 
projections were finalised, the macroeconomic projections are based on the technical 
assumption that, as of 1 January 2021, the European Union (EU) and the United 
Kingdom will trade on the basis of the World Trade Organ
ization™s most favoured 
nation terms. Other risks relate to the possibility that, in an effort to reduce their 
dependence on external suppliers
, countries start to 
diversify global suppliers 
(potentially increasing resilience) and/or to re
-shore production
 (negative
ly affecting
 complex global value chains
). Global economic activity and trade
 The global economy 
staged a sharp rebound in the third quarter of 2020, which 
was stronger than previously envisaged.
 As the number of infections gradually 
abated and containment measures were lifted, the global economy started to rebound 
strongly. Economic recovery, especially among advanced economies, was supported 
mainly by private consumption, which was also propped u
p by the generous policy 
support deployed at the peak of the crisis. Across emerging market economies, net 
exports also contributed positively, given the recovery in external demand. In China, 
while private investment remained the main driver of the reboun
d, private 
consumption contributed positively to GDP growth for the first time in the year. Overall, 
global real GDP (excluding the euro area) expanded at a stronger pace than was 
envisaged 
in the 
September
 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.
 Incoming
 survey data point to a continued
 growth momentum at the start of the 
fourth quarter
, although consumer confidence remains weak.
 In November
 the 
global composite output P
urchasing Managers™ Index (PMI)
 (excluding the euro area) 
improved further to

 in

Developments were mixed across countries
, as
 the composite 
output PMI increased further
 in the U
nited 
States, but
 fell into contractionary territory in 
the U
nited 
Kingdom, while remaining
 broadly unchanged 
and still in contractionary 
territory in Japan. 
Among emerging market economies, the composite PMI rose 
further 
in China
, point
ing to sol
id growth in activity, 
while it decreased in India and 
Brazil, albeit from very high levels
, thus
 point
ing to continued
 expansion in activity
. At 
the same time, global consumer confidence, despite recovering from the trough 
recorded in the second quarter o
f 2020, remains below pre
-crisis levels, suggesting a 
rather subdued recovery in consumption.

 A number of headwinds, not least the renewed containment measures in 
response to rising numbers of COVID
-19 infections, cloud the near
-term 
economic outlook.
 The resurgence 
in COVID
-19 infection
s weighs on the global 
economic recovery
. Compared with governments™ 
response
s to 
COVID
-19 in the 
spring, containment measures during the second wave, while heterogeneous across 
countries, tend to be
 more 
targeted and less disruptive 
to
 economic activity
. 
However, 
the resurgence of the virus is expected to weigh on agents™ behaviour, particularly in 
the most contact
-intense sectors. Moreover, t
he unwinding of the temporary support 
extended by governments in the course of 2020 
may
 lead to 
a ﬁfiscal cliffﬂ
 in 2021, 
particularly across advanced economies
, unless additional fiscal stimulus is provided 
for in their 2021 budgetary plans. Finally, t
he elevated uncertainty as to the nature of 
post
-transition trading relations
 between the EU and the United Kingdom, i
ncluding 
those for services,
 is assumed to weigh on the growth outlook
. Global financial conditions continued to ease in recent months amid some 
volatility.
 The recovery in risky assets, which had started in late March, came to a 
temporary halt in Septembe
r on the back of rising global cases
 of COVID
-19, 
heightened uncertainty related to the US presidential elections
 on 3 November
 and the

Global financial conditions now stand at

Given the 
complex nature of the COVID
-19 shock, its long
-term effects on the global economy 
remain an open question. In particular, given that the pandemic hit labour
-intensive 
sectors harder, long
-term scars may initially materialise via l
ower labour supply, but 
also via 
the capital stock, as was 
the case
 in past financial crises
 (see Box 1)
. In the United States, the resurgence of COVID
-19 infections and fading fiscal 
stimulus cloud the near
-term outlook.
 Real GDP increased by 33.1% annual
ised 
(7.4% 
quarter on quarter) 
in the third quarter
. This was
 driven by a strong recovery in 
consumption and investment, which 
was 
in turn reflected in a sharp recovery in real 
imports. Despite the exceptionally strong rebound, US 
activity
 remains below it
s pre
-pandemic level
. As the number of new COVID
-19 infections and hospitalisations 
has risen above previous peaks, new restrictions on mobility have been implemented 
across states. The waning effects of fiscal stimulus on households™ income
, amid the 
fail
ure to agree on a new stimulus package
, were
 only partly offset by the unwinding of 
savings accumulated in previous quarters. As a result
, consumption is expected to 
slow
 in the current quarter
, as 
also 
suggested by 
high
-frequency 
indicators on credit 
and debit card data.
 Labour market conditions have improved
, but the recovery 
remains incomplete. The unemployment rate has fallen amid a decline in temporary 
layoffs, but the number of new job postings remains subdued, suggesting weak 
employment gains in the 
near term.
 Annual headline consumer price index (CPI) 
inflation decreased to 1.2% in October from 1.4% in September
, reflecting falling

  11 energy prices
, while food prices remained unchanged. Core inflation declined 
marginally to 1.6%
, from 1.7% in September,
 as a further increase in core goods 
inflation, particularly in used cars and trucks, was more than offset by a decline in core 
services, mainly in medical services.
 In China, the economic recovery has been swift and 
has 
broaden
ed to the 
service sector.
 After the sharp
 rebound in the
 second quarter (+11.7% quarter on 
quarter)
, China™s GDP continued to expand in the third quarter
, albeit
 at a more 
moderate pace (+2.7% quarter on quarter). Final consumption contributed positively to 
growth, while investmen
t has been more resilient
, also
 owing to government support 
for
 infrastructure spending
, which helped jump
-start the recovery after the initial sharp 
contraction. Net exports contributed positively to growth
, partly
 reflecting China™s role 
in supplying med
ical and technology goods worldwide. Monthly data point to 
continued 
robust 
growth in the fourth quarter. P
MIs
 for both manufacturing and 
services output point to further improvements in activity in November. Industrial 
production has recovered robustly
, and retail sales strengthened further in October. 
Annual headline inflation decreased in October to 0.5%
, from 1.7% in the previous 
month, mainly 
owing to a decline in food prices.
 In Japan, domestic and external demand supported the economic recovery, but 
the pace of expansion is set to decelerate amid an increase in COVID
-19 infections.
 Real GDP in the third quarter expanded by 5.3% (quarter on quarter). 
In 
particular, the
 easing of domestic containment measures, a strong policy response, 
and a recovery in
 external demand supported private consumption and exports, while 
investment activity remained subdued amid still elevated uncertainty. The recovery is 
expected to continue, albeit at a moderate pace. 
To some extent
, this reflects growing 
concerns related 
to a recent surge in new infections. The Bank of Japan announced a 
special deposit facility to enhance the resilience of the regional financial system, while 
the government recently announced a third supplementary budget for the fiscal year 
2020, which sho
uld
 both
 provide some support to activity in coming quarters. Annual 
headline CPI inflation declined further in October to 
-0.4%
, from 0% in September, 
albeit mostly reflecting idiosyncratic factors, such as the fading impact of the VAT h
ike 
introduced in 
October 2019.
 In the United Kingdom, the economic recovery is faltering amid renewed 
lockdown measures.
 The economy rebounded in the third quarter (+15.5% quarter 
on quarter), supported by a strong recovery in consumption, while the contribution of 
net exp
orts was negative. 
However, t
he growth momentum is set to reverse. I
ncoming 
surveys suggest a significant slowdown in growth momentum since August, even 
ahead of the month
-long national lockdown imposed 
in November 
on the 
non-essential retail, food, accomm
odation and leisure sectors (
accounting for 
around 
12% of value added in the economy). Although 
these measures 
constrain activity less 
compared 
with
 the strict lockdown introduced in the spring, the composite PMI fell 
back into contractionary territory in 
November. Meanwhile, subdued labour market 
prospects constrain consumption, and uncertainty relat
ing to the post
-transition 
trading relations, including services, 
continue to restrain private investment. 
Given

some 
stockpiling of imports in the United Kingdom 
is 
assumed
 in the fourth quarter of 2020, 
which would then 
unwind in early 2021.
 Inflation picked up
 in October
, slightly ahead 
of expectations, 
with a
nnual headline consumer price inf
lation 
increasing
 to 0.7% 
from 0.5% in the previous month. The rise was driven by a rebound from negative 
territory in goods™ prices, while annual service price inflation remained flat at 1.4%. 
Core CPI inflation a
lso increased slightly to 1.5%.
 In central
 and eastern European countries, the economic recovery is expected 
to come to a temporary halt as the pandemic situation deteriorates.
 Real GDP in 
the region rebounded 
sharply 
in the third quarter as production normalised amid 
the 
easing 
of 
containment mea
sures. However, the pandemic has been re
-intensifying 
across the region, with daily new infections rising above 
the levels recorded in 
the first 
wave. As stringency indicators have been tightening in most 
central and eastern 
European 
countries, the recover
y is expected to stall until early 2021. Thereafter, the 
easing of restrictions and health
-related
 concerns 
is expected
 to revive growth, also 
supported by robust fiscal and monetary measures. Looking ahead, activity is 
expected to remain below its end
-2019 levels until early 2022.
 In large commodity
-exporting countries
, the pace of recovery is set to slow 
amid
 a still high number of infections
 and reduced room for further fiscal 
support
. In Russia, the economy is expected to recover in the third quarter ow
ing to 
policy support and improved infection control. Moreover, the temporary eas
ing
 of 
OPEC+
1 production cuts supported recent oil production
, and the recovery 
in growth 
of 
key trading partners has further supported energy exports. However, as the number 
of infections is again
 on the rise
, growth is set to slow again in the fourth quarter. In 
Brazil,
 the economy
 has rebound
ed, helped by strong monetary and fiscal policy 
support measures 
that
 were among
 the largest in Latin America. 
However, the number 
of 
COVID
-19 cases remains high. While limited adoption of containment measures
 has reduc
ed the economic repercussions of the initial shock, it has intensified the 
severity of the pandemic itself. Elevated infection rates together with limited fiscal 
space goi
ng forward will also drag on investment and consumption, and ultimately
 on the economic recovery path
, with moderate growth rates 
forecast 
in the short and 
medium term.
 In Turkey, the economic impact of COVID
-19 was sharp but short
-lived
, and the 
rebound i
n manufacturing activity is driving the economic recovery.
 The 
sharp 
upturn in 
the third quarter (+15.6% quarter on quarter) 
reflects 
strong private 
consumption and investment
 in view of the 
very favourable financing conditions. The 
manufacturing sector 
is driving
 the recovery, 
although services have also 
picked up
 significantly from the deep slump at the peak of the crisis. Overall, economic activity in 
Turkey has recovered to pre
-pandemic levels. However, as the policy stimulus is 
gradually reduced, growt
h is expected to moderate, particularly in credit
-driven 
personal consumption.

  13 Global 
trade 
(excluding the euro area) also rebounded vigorously in the third 
quarter
 and is expected to moderate in the fourth.
 World merchandise imports 
(excluding the euro ar
ea) continued to expand in 
September
 (3.4% 
month on month
) after recording a 1.9% increase in August. Overall, these data confirm a solid recovery 
of world trade in the third quarter (+9.4% 
quarter on quarter
), after the strong 
contraction registered in th
e second quarter 
(-9.7% 
quarter on quarter) (see Chart 2)
. 
The strong rebound in the third quarter 
reflect
s the composition of the economic 
recovery and the more orderly functioning of global value chains
, but trade in services 
is still seen to weigh on gl
obal trade, as some sectors (for example, 
tourism)
 collapsed
 as a result of the COVID
-19 shock
. 
Survey data point to a continued, but moderating, 
pace of growth in the fourth quarter. The 
global PMI (excl
uding the euro area
) for 
manufacturing new export or
ders
, which correlates well with global trade, 
rose in 
November to 51.5, up from 50.3 in October

 at a more moderate pace

 reflects their strong procyclicality, 
in particular
 during economic 
downturns. Temporary disruptions in global supply chains and increased trade costs

scenarios

 a mild and 
a severe scenario. These scenarios can be seen as 
providing an illustrative range around the baseline projection

development of effective vaccine

 confid
ence that
 the pandemic
 may be 
successfully contained and has made the materialisation of a severe scenario less 
likely. 
Furth
ermore, as the COVID
-19 pandemic has exposed the dependence of 
several countries on external suppliers, this may result in efforts to diversify global 
suppliers (potentially increasing resilience) and/or to re
-shore production
 (negatively 
affect
ing
 complex global value chains
). Global price developments
 Oil prices have increased by almost 25% since mid
-September.
 After the strong 
rebound over the summer, 
oil prices 
stalled in September and October. 
Since early 
November o
il prices have 
risen, 
followi
ng positive trends in global financial markets as 
increasing prospects for the delivery of 
several
 vaccine
s raise the odds of a return to 
normality in 2021. 
Nonetheless
, neither the International Energy Agency (IEA) nor 
OPEC anticipate a significant 
rise i
n oil demand until late 2021. Indeed, the IEA 
expects the recovery in oil demand to 
slow in the fourth quarter of
 2020 amid the 
increase in new COVID
-19 cases around the world.
 After having remained in contango 
(i.e. oil prices for delivery in the future a
re higher) since March, the futures curve 
again
 moved into backwardation (i.e. oil prices for delivery in the future are 
lower) in early 
December.
 Global inflation remains subdued amid weak global demand.
 Annual consumer 
price inflation in
 member countries
 of the
 Organisation for 
Economic 
Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) 
eased slightly to 1.2% in October. Food price inflation remained 
steady at 3.6%, while

inflation 
increased further
. 
Annual

annual consumer price inflation fell in the U

 Over the review period (
10 September
 to 9 December 2020
) the forward curve of the 
euro overnight index average (EONIA) 
fluctuated somewhat
, but eventually remained 
broadly u
nchanged. This reflects
 concerns about the accelerat
ed spread of 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) in Europe 
set against
 positive vaccine news
. As it continues 
to be 
inverted 
only 
mildly 
at the short end, the curve 
does not signal firm expectations 
of 
a rate cut
 in the very near term
. 
Long-term sovereign bond 
spreads 
dropped 
signi
ficantly in the euro area
 amid 
further expectations of continued monetary and 
fiscal support 
together with a
 global improvement in risk sentiment
, triggered in 
particular by the news of successful vaccine trials. The p
rices of risk assets increased
 accordi
ngly. 
In foreign exchange markets, the euro 
depreciated 
slightly
 in 
trade
-weighted terms
. The

EONIA
) and the new benchmark 
euro

 average
d -46 and 
-55 basis points respectively
 over the 
review period
.3 Excess liquidity increased by •4
75 billion to around •3,
456 billion. 
This change mainly reflects asset purchases under the pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) and the asset purchase programme (APP), as well as 
the settlement of targeted longer
-ter
m refinancing operations (TLTRO III) in 
September.
 The EONIA forward curve 
is broadly unchanged compared with the start of the 
review period
 (see 
Chart 4).
 At the same time, the forward curve displayed 
discernible intra
-period fluctuations. The inversion o
f the curve in the first part of the 
review period reflected concerns about the accelerated spread of COVID
-19 in 
Europe, but the curve then flattened on 9 November when the first in a string of 
positive announcements about vaccines was made. Since then, t
he curve has 
remained broadly unchanged. The trough of the curve, which is 10 basis points below 
the current EONIA level of 
-47 basis points, corresponds to April 2022. The curve thus 
indicates that financial 
market
s are not pricing in
 an imminent rate cut
. Furthermore, 
surveys and model
-based evidence suggest that short
-term risk
-free rates are 
expected to remain stable over the coming months.
                                                                     3  The methodology for

significantly on the back of the vaccine news
 (see Chart 7).
 Stock prices were 
supported by a continued improvement in short
-term earnings 
growth 
expectations, 
while longer
-term earnings expectations were revised down
, signalling downside 
macroeconomic risks and the potential for longer
-term economic scars from the 
pandemic
. At the same time, risk sentiment improved upon the vaccine news that 
started to emerge in early November, reducing the equity risk premium and supporting 
equity prices. Overall, the stock prices of euro area and US non
-financial corporations 
(NFC
s) increased 
by 
9.2
% and 
10.0
% respectively. The equity prices of euro area and 
US banks benefited to a larger extent from the news of successful vaccine trials, with 
indices increasing by 
23.1% and 21.
9% respectively, partly recovering the greater 
losses 
(compared to NFCs) recorded since the beginning of the pandemic.

ivity
 Euro area real GDP 
grew strongly, by
 12.5
% quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 
2020. Economic activity in the euro area was
 underpinned
 by 
a sharp rebound in all 
demand components, as
 coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic 
containment measures
 began to be lifted as of 
May 
2020. 
This was reflected in positive contributions to GDP 
growth from private consumption, investment and net trade
. 
Nonethel
ess, the level of 
GDP in the third
 quarter 
of 2020 remained
 4.4% 
below its 
pre
-pandemic 
level in 
the 
fourth quarter of 
2019. Incoming information about the economy, including from 
surveys and high
-frequency indicators, is consistent with a 
significant decline
 in 
activity in the final quarter of 2020, 
although to a much lesser extent than observed in 
the s
econd quarter of this year
, as a result of the sharp resurgence of the pandemic 
and the necessary reintroduction of containment measures since mid
-October, 
primarily affecting the services sector. While real GDP is estimated to have contracted 
in the fourt
h quarter of 2020, the outlook for 2021 and beyond remains tightly linked to 
the evolution of the pandemic and the roll
-out of COVID
-19 vaccines
. The December 
2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual 
real GDP 
decreas
ing
 by 7.3% in 2020,
 and increasing by 3.9
% in 20
21, 4.2
% in
 2022 and 2.1% 
2023. 
Compared with the September 2020 projections, real GDP growth has 
been revised 
upwards
 by 
0.7 percentage points for 2020
, downwards by 
1.1 
percentage points for 2021 and upwar
ds by 1.0 percentage points for 2022, thereby 
broadly recovering to the level projected in the September baseline scenario over the 
medium term. 
Although 
downside risks to the outlook have 
become less pronounced
 owing to t
he news about the prospects for va
ccine roll
-outs in the near future
, they 
remain tilted to the downside
 on account of
 the implications of the pandemic for 
economic and financial conditions.
 Growth in the euro area rebounded strongly
 in the third quarter of 20
20, but it is 
estimated to 
have receded again in the final quarter of the year.
 Real GDP 
bounced back
 by 
12.5
%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 
2020, 
partially 
recovering from the 
sharp and deep 
cumulative fall of 15.0% in the first half of the year 
(see Chart 
10). 
Overa
ll, the level of GDP in the third qua
rter of 2020 remained 4.4% 
below the
 level 
in the last quarter of 2019
. Domestic demand 
made
 a positive 
contribution to growth in the third quarter of 20
20, while c
hanges in inventories 
made a 
small negative contributio
n. Developments in the 
external sector
 also supported
 euro 
area growth, as reflected 
in 
a positive
 contribution
 from net trade
. 
When accounting for 
the import intensity of each demand component, e
xternal factors 
made a particularly 
strong contribution to g
rowth
 dynamics in 2020
 (see Box 4)
. 
On the production side, 
the rebound in 
the third quarter was 
driven by both
 manufacturing and services
. 
However, developments varied markedly across sectors. This was particularly the 
case for 
services
, where production 
remained significantly
 below 
its pre
-pandemic 
level.

 Note: The latest observations are for the 
third quarter of 20
20. The labour market situation improved somewhat in the third quarter
, given the 
strong rebound in activity.
 Employment increased by 
1.0% in the third quarter 
of 
2020, after a decrease of 
3.0% in the second quarter (see Chart 
11). 
Despite this 
improvement, 
employment was 2.
2% lower
 in the third quarter
 of 2020 
than in the 
fourth quarter of 2019.
 Hours worked continue to play an important role in the 
adjustment of the labour market in the euro area. Total hours worked increased by 
14.8% in the third quarter, after a decline of 13.6% in the second quarter, but remained 
4.6% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 The unemployment rate was 8.4% in 
October, after having reached 8.7% in July
, and remained 
about 1.2 percentage points 
hig
her than in February, before the pandemic.
 Job retention schemes continue to 
support the labour market. 
Workers in job retention schemes 
were 
estimated at about 
5% of the labour force in October, down from about 18% in April
, but the numbers are 
starting t
o rise again in some countries in response to the latest lockdown measures
.5 Short
-term labour market indicators have partially recovered
, but continue to 
signal contractionary developments.
 The Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) for 
employment increased mar
ginally to 48.
3 in November from 48.
2 in October. It has 
recovered significantly since April
, when it reached its lowest level on record. 
However, the current level of the PMI continues to suggest a contraction in 
employment and could be read as an early i
ndication of subdued employment 
prospects in the period ahead.

employment, November 20
20 for the PMI and October 20
20 for the unemployment rate.
 Following 
a substantia
l rebound in 
the third quarter, by 14.0% quarter on 
quarter
, consumer spending 
started to 
falter
 again 
in 
the fourth quarter
. While 
car registrations 
hovered
 close to their pre
-pandemic
 level (down 4.1% 
year on year
) in October
, in the same month r
etail trade 
increased 
by 
1.5
%, 
month on month. It is 
likely that these do not yet capture the impact of the reintroduction of containment 
measures as of mid
-October
. 
By contrast, c
onsumer confidence 
continued to decline
 in November, standing at 
-17.6
, comp
ared to 
-14.5 on average in 
the third quarter
. In 
some euro area countries,
 consumption of durables 
already exceeded pre
-pandemic 
levels by a small margin in the third quarter
. However, 
this was overshadowed by the 
negative impact of 
services consumption
, which is still 
far
 below historical trends
. 
Households 
have become
 increasingly worried that their financial situation is 
deteriorating
, so 
inte
ntions to make major purchases
 have remained
 at their lowest 
level since the 
sovereign 
debt 
crisis
. Owing to pre
cautionary behaviour by consumers 
and tighter lockdown measures
, the saving rate is expected to rise again in 
the fourth 
quarter
. Business investment (proxied by non
-construction investment) 
increased 
strongly
, 
by 13.6% 
quarter on quarter, in the third qua
rter of 20
20, but the 
recovery faltered in the fourth quarter.
 Notwithstanding the sharp rebound, the 
level of 
non-construction 
investment remains 
15.7% 
below the pre
-crisis level
. 
Despite 
a positive reading from the 
October and November 
PMI for capital go
ods (55.
6 in 
November, up 
from 54.
7 in Sep
tember
), investment is expected to decline in 
the fourth 
quarter, as the second wave of the pandemic is expected to have also had an impact 
on corporate profits.
 Moreover, business investment confidence further declined in 
November, while c
apacity utilisation remains well below its pre
-crisis level, implying 
room to expand production with existing capital stock. At the same time, the relative 
resilience of the man
ufacturing sector to the new lockdowns may be seen as a positive 
sign 
for the investment outlook
 in the short term

  26 increased debt
 burden, as reflected in 
higher corporate 
leverage ratios
, poses 
downside risks to the
 reco
very
 in investment
. Household investment (proxied by residential construction investment) also 
bounced back strongly, by 12.3% quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2020, 
but the short
-term outlook remains uncertain
. The strong rebound in the third 
quarter of 2020 fell short of a full recovery, as investment in residential construction still 
stood 3.8% below its end
-2019 level. The pronounced cross
-country diversity in 
housing dynamics during the first three quarters of 2020 should subside over the sh
ort 
term, as prospects are looking dim for all of the largest euro area countries, despite 
some positive signals at the start of the fourth quarter. The latest data on the issuance 
of building permits show a marked deceleration
 in the first half of the yea
r, hinting at 
fewer construction plans in the pipeline. In October, the PMI for construction output 
and real estate services fell deeper into contractionary territory. After a small uptick in 
October, confidence among construction and real estate firms dec
lined in November 
as the new round of measures to contain the second wave of the coronavirus since 
mid
-October took a toll on business. Over the same period, companies in the 
construction and real estate sectors reported increasing supply
-side constraints
 on their production, especially related to their financial conditions. On the demand side
, according to the European Commission™s consumer survey,
 the new restrictions and 
the 
heightened 
uncertainty 
related to
 the 
resurgence of the 
pandemic 
discouraged
 households 
from spending on major items, including on new and existing housing 
stock, in November
. Euro area trade rebounded strongly and provided a positive contribution to 
GDP growth in the third quarter of 2020, but its recovery is set to slow
 down in 
the 
months ahead.
 While euro area real exports of goods 
more than 
regained the 
ground lost in the previous quarter
, increasing 
by 
20.1
% quarter on quarter
, euro area 
real exports of services 
only rebounded by 9.2%, following a decrease of 21.0%
. The 
net trade 
contribution to GDP growth was markedly positive (
2.4
 percentage 
points
). 
Data on t
rade in goods reveal that exports expanded across the board in September. 
Non
-chemical manufactured 
goods exports,
 especially of 
machinery and transport 
equipment
, had a stronger quarterly rebound in relative terms in the third quarter of 
2020. This 
was 
particularly true for car exports. 
However, renewed lockdown 
measures are likely to disrupt the recovery pattern of euro area trade in the months 
ahead. Although sti
ll pointing to further improvement for trade in goods
, the euro area 
PMI for new manufacturing export orders decreased to 53 in November
, while 
the 
European Commission
™s assessment of export order
 book levels improved only 
marginally in negative territory.
 On the other hand, 
the 
new 
COVID
-19 restrictions 
are 
weigh
ing
 on the already impaired trade in services
, and the PMI for services new 
export orders 
declined 
further to 39.2.
 High
-frequency indicators and the
 latest survey results
 are consistent with a 
fal
l in GDP in the final quarter of 2020
. There has been a
 clear downward trend in
 high
-frequency
 mobility indicators
 for euro area countries in recent months, moving in 
tandem with a
 composite stringe
ncy index that has remained 
around half
-way 
between its pe
ak in April and subsequent trough in July
. 
Survey indicators 
point to a 
renewed contraction in activity primarily affecting the
 services
 sector

of

tourism
 by domestic tourism seen during the first wave of the 
pandemic, suggesting an 
overall deterioration of tourism services in the 
last quarter of 
the year
 (see Box 5)
. 
The flash PMI composite output 
index 
decreased strongly from 
50.0
 in October to 45.
3 in November
, largely driven by a substantial decline in the 
index for services (from 46.9 to 41.

Meanwhile, t
he index for manufacturing output 
also declined
, but by much less
, from 58.4 to 55.3
, remain
ing
 consistent with 
expanding ac
tivity
. 
However, t
he short
-term outlook remains surrounded by elevated 
uncertainty, not least 
in view of 
the 
unusual changes
 in 
statistica
l and economic 
relationships during
 the 
COVID
-19 pandemic (see Box 3 for a description of
 innovations in the ECB™s ana
lytical 
toolkit to assess the short
-term impact of the 
pandemic).
 Looking ahead, 
expectations for growth in the medium
 term 
remain tightly 
linked to the gradual evolution of the pandemic and the successful roll
-out of 
COVID
-19 vaccines.
 While the early sta
rt to the distribution of vaccines is a key factor 
supporting the expectations of a rapid recovery, it will take time before widespread 
immunity is reached and the euro area and the global economy is able to return to 
ﬁnormalityﬂ. According to a survey of 
large corporations conducted to test what 
ﬁnormalityﬂ might look like in the long term, the pandemic is expected to lead to greater 
digitalisation and more teleworking, with the expectation of persistent higher 
productivity but at the same time also persis
tent lower 
demand
 (see Box 6)
. In this 
uncertain environment, and to reduce hysteresis risks, t
he ECB™s accommodative 
monetary conditions will continue to support domestic demand, while ongoing fiscal 
and employment measures
 should 
continue to support priv
ate consumption.
 The December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro 
area foresee annual real GDP decreasing by 7.3% in 2020, and increasing by 
3.9% in 2021, 4.2% in 2022 and 2.1% 2023
 (see Chart 12).
 Compared with the 
September 2020 projections, real GDP growth has been revised 
upwards
 by 
0.7 
percentage points for 2020
, downwards by 
1.1 percentage points for 2021 and 
upwards by 1.0 percentage points for 2022, thereby broadly recovering to the level 
pro
jected in the September baseline scenario over the medium term. Although 
downside risks to the outlook have become less pronounced 
owing 
to the news about 
the prospects for vaccine roll
-outs in the near future, they remain tilted to the downside 
on account
 of the implications of the pandemic for economic and financial conditions.

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, e
uro area annual inflation remained 
unchanged at 
-0.3 % in November. On the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into 
account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation is likely to 
remain negative until early 2021. Thereafter, it 
is expected to increase owing to the 
end of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany and upward base effects in energy 
price inflation. At the same time, underlying price pressures are expected to remain 
subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism a
nd travel
-related sectors, as 
well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Once 
the impact of the pandemic fades, a recovery in demand, supported by 
accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will put upward pressure on in
flation 
over the medium term. Market
-based indicators and survey
-based measures of 
longer
-term inflation expectations remain at low levels. This assessment is broadly 
reflected in the baseline scenario of the December 2020 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic pr
ojections for the euro area, which foresees annual inflation at 0.2
% in 2020, 1.0
% in 2021, 1.1
% in 2022 and 1.
4% in 2023. Compared with the September 
2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation has been revised 
down for 2020 and 20

remained unchanged in November 2020

inflation 
rate of

  31 Wage pressures are blurred by the impact of government support measures on 
compensation.
 Developments in 
compensation per employee and compensation per 
hour showed significant volatility and
 diverg
ence between the t
wo measures during 
the first 
three quarters
 of 2020. Annual growth in compensation per employee 
increased to 0.6% in the third quarter, after 
falling
 to 
-4.7% in the second quarter, from 
0.6% in the first
 quarter
 and 1.
7% in the fourth quarter of 2019
. Annual growth in 
compensation per hour

 rose 
from 2.0% in the fourth quarter of 
2019 to 4.
3% in the first quarter of 2020, and further to 9.
3% in the second quarter
, 
before falling to 3.0% in the third quarter of 2020 (see Chart 15)
. Thes
e divergent
 developments reflect the impact of short
-time work and temporary lay
-off schemes, 
under which workers maintained their employment status but only received part of 
their usual compensation, while actual hours worked per person declined sharply. 
This 
effect 
was 
partly reversed in the third quarter
, in line with the rebound in activity
. At the 
same time, the decrease in compensation per employee overstates the 
actual 
loss in 
labour income, as a number of countries record government support
, 
for sta
tistical 
purposes
, under transfers rather than compensation.
7 Negotiated wages, which are 
not directly affected by developments in hours worked and the recording of benefits 
from job retention schemes, 
declined to 1.6% in the third quarter of 2020,
 from
 1.7% in 
the second quarter, after 1.9% in the first quarter. While this implies only a slow 
weakening, the data still include agreements concluded before the onset of the 
pandemic.

 Money

  34 5 Money and credit
 Monetary dynamics in the euro area continued to reflect the impact of the coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) pandemic. In October money growth stabilised at rates that
 were twice as 
high as before the pandemic, owing to the implementation of monetary policy 
measures and the preference for liquid assets. Domestic credit remained the main 
source of money creation, driven by loans to non
-financial corporations (NFCs)
 and the Eurosystem™s 
net purchases of government 
bonds. The timely and sizeable 
measures taken by monetary, fiscal and supervisory authorities have ensured the flow 
of 
credit 
to the euro area economy
 at favourable terms. Firms™ total external financing 
levelled
 off
 in the third quarter of 2020. S
mall and medium
-sized enterprises (SMEs), 
which depend critically on banks for financing, reported some slight improvements in 
their access to external finance
 in the period from April to October but expect a 
deteriorati
on in coming months.
 Firms™ overall cost of debt financing is now close to the 
pre
-pandemic level, as the cost of market
-based debt moderated again, and bank 
lending rates remained close to historical lows. However, upward pressure on bank 
lending rates is
 expected, as the deteriorating credit risk environment is denting bank 
balance sheets and profitability.
 Broad money 
growth was broadly unchanged in October.
 Monetary dynamics 
continued to suffer the effects of the COVID
-19 pandemic, which has triggered a
n exceptional preference for liquidity. T
he annual growth rate of 
the broad monetary 
aggregate (
M3) edged up slightly in October, to 10
.5%, from 
10.4% in September, 
stabilising at a level twice as high as before the onset of the pandemic (see Chart 18). 
The annual growth rate of the most liquid monetary aggregate, M1, 
which comprises 
overnight deposits and currency in circulation
, remained stable at an elevated level of 
13.8% in October, thus strongly contributing to M3 growth. These developments
 reflect th
e liquidity 
being built up 
by firms and households amid increased uncertainty
, but also 
Œ in the case of households
 Œ some forced savings owing to reduced 
opportunities to consume. 
The strong growth in money was also the result of sizeable 
support measures
 taken by the ECB and supervisory authorities, as well as national 
governments, to ensure sufficient liquidity is provided to the economy to address the 
economic consequences of the
 pandemic

 Strong growth in o
vernight deposits
 continues t
o reflect high uncertainty
. Overnight deposits, which have been the main contributor to growth in M3, continued 
to expand at a relatively stable, yet very high, annual rate of 
14.3% in
 October. 
Money 
holders™ preference for overnight deposits continue
d to 
reflect
 precautionary motives 
and the very low level of interest rates, which reduces the opportunity cost of holding 
such instruments, especially 
when 
compared 
with
 other
, less liquid 
ones. The growth 
in deposits was mainly driven by holdings of firms and
 households.
 In the case of 
firms, growth in deposit holdings varied across jurisdictions, reflecting differences in 
the extent to which the liquidity needs of firms materialised and in the form and size of 
support measures across countries. Furthermore, c
urrency in circulation
 grew at a 
broadly stable annual rate of 10.7% in October.
 By comparison, o
ther short
-term 
deposits
 and marketable instruments 
continued to make
 a small 
contribution to annual 
M3 growth
, mirroring the low level of interest rates and t
he search
-for
-yield behaviour 
of investors.
 Domestic c
redit 
has 
remained the 
main
 source of money creation
 as the
 contribution of the 
Eurosystem™s 
net 
asset purchases
 increased.
 From the start 
of 2018 to September 2020 c
redit 
growth 
to the private sector 
had been
 the
 main 
driver of M3 growth from the counterpart perspective
 (see the blue portion of the bars 
in Chart 
19). In October 2020, however
, the
 Eurosystem™s net purchases of 
government securities under the ECB™s asset
 purchase programme 
(APP) 
and the 
pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(PEPP) took over as the largest 
contributor
 to M3 growth 
(see the 
red portion of the
 bars in Chart 
19). At the same 
time, the flow
 of credit from 
the banking sector (excluding the Eurosystem) 
to the 
public sector
 has m
oderated over recent months 
(see the light green portion of the 
bars in Chart 
19). Net external m
onetary 
flows were broadly balanced in the 12 
months to October (see the yellow portion of the bars in Chart 19), while l
onger-term 
financial liabilities
 and other counterparts
 exerted a negative impact on money growth
 (see the dark green

loans to the private sector 
was unchanged at
 4.6% in October
, 
one percentage point higher than before the outbreak of the 
pandemic
 (see Chart
 18). Shorter
-term dynamics, however, point to a slowdown, as 
evidenced by the markedly lower monthly loan flows since June. C
redit growth 
has 
continued to be driven 
mainly
 by loans to firms
, with an
 annual growth rate 
of 6.8% in 
October, after 7.1% in September
, 
while growth in loans to households remained 
stable at 3.1%
 (see Chart
 20). 
The deceleration 
in the annual growth rate of loans to 
firms 
occurred in the context of abating emergency liquidity needs, weak investment 
and tighter credit 
conditions.
 Firms™ reliance on
 long
er-term loans 
has 
continued to 
increase at the expense of short
er-term
 loans
. The divergence in the dynamics of 
loans to fir
ms and 
loans to 
households reflect
s the specific nature of the COVID
-19 crisis, which 
has 
led to a collapse in corporate cash flows and 
has forced
 firms to 
increase
 their reliance on external financing.

standard deviation
 is calculated using a fixed sample of 12

comparison with
 early 2020
, but they expect a 
deterioration going forward.

survey on the access to finance of enterprises
 (SAFE), SMEs 
reported an improvement in access
 to 
public financia
l support
 for the 
first time since 2009
, 
which 
suggest
s that the initiatives by a number of governments 
to provide public guarantees for bank loans during the COVID
-19 pandemic have fed 
through to these enterprises
 (see Chart 21). At the same time, enterpr
ises perceived 
the
ir access to finance 
as being 
negatively affected 
by the general economic outlook, 
but also by 
their firm
-specific outlook and capital position
. Euro area firms also 
reported a 
marked deterioration in the
ir turnover and profits
, which was
 widespread 
across countries and sectors. Since
 the demand for external funds to bridge liquidity 
gaps increased markedly, the financing gap (the difference between the demand for 
and the availability of external financing) rose slightly further.
 Moreover,
 the SAFE 
results also showed that SMEs, and to a lesser extent large firms, 
expect
ed a deterioration in the availability of most 
sources of 
external financing, in particular, bank 
loans and credit lines

s face favourable funding conditions but 
credit risk weighs on their
 balance sheets and 
profitability
. The 
composite cost of debt financing
 for euro area 
banks, which
 had risen after the 
COVID
-19 outbreak, has fallen back close to its 
pre
-pandemic 
historical low of February
 2020 (see Chart
 22). This was due 
mainly 
to 
lower b
ond yields
, 
suppor
ted by the 
ECB™s
 monetary policy
 measures. 
The ECB™s 
APP and PEPP 
are
 having a favourable impact on bond yields
, which is also benefiting 
the pricing of securities issued by banks. Moreover, b
anks partly replaced 
market
-based funding with TLTROs, 
thereby p
lacing downward pressure on bank 
bond yields. Finally, prices for
 covered bank bonds 
are being
 directly 
supported by the 
ECB™s 
third covered bond purchase programm
e (CBPP3). In addition,
 deposit rates of 
euro area banks, which account for the bulk of bank 
funding, remained at historical 
lows in October 2020, thereby contributing to favourable bank debt funding conditions. 
Euro area banks 
have 
increasingly charged negative interest rates 
on NFC deposits 
held with them 
since the onset of the COVID
-19 crisis
. At the same time
, a large part of 
banks™ deposit funding, in particular retail deposits, still 
has a
 zero
-interest floor
, 
which 
compresses banks™ net interest rate 
margins. 
Although b
anks 
are 
benefit
ing
 from 
favourable funding conditions,
 the deterioration
 in borrower creditworthiness owing to 
the pandemic is having a negative impact on their profitability and capital positions. As 
shown by the October 2020 
euro area bank
 lending survey
, banks 
tightened
 their 
credit standards in the third quarter of 2020,
 reflect
ing their
 heightened risk perception 
as a result of

The latest observation
s are
 for 
October 2020
. Bank lending rates 
remain very favourable but upward 
pressure is expected
. In 
October c
omposite bank lending rates for loans to 
firms
 remained close to their 
historical lows
 at 1.53%, while those for loans to households for house purchase fell to 
a new historical low of 1.36% (see Chart 23). This development
 was widespread 
across euro area countries. Moreover, the spread between bank lending rates on very 
small loans and those on large loans stabilised at levels below those observed before 
the pandemic. At the same time
, the severe economic impact of the pand
emic on 
firms™ revenues, households™ employment prospects and overall borrower 
creditworthiness 
continued to 
put upward pressure on bank lending rates. 
The benign 
reaction of bank lending rates to the 
pandemic
 thus far appears to
 reflect 
two
 factors. 
First
, the effectiveness of the measures taken by the ECB, bank supervisors and 
governments to 
offset the procyclical impact of the pandemic shock on 
credit supply
. In 
this respect, 
the extension of government guarantee
 scheme
s for
 loans 
in some 
countries, 
at l
east until June 2021
, will continue to shield bank lending rates from 
adverse developments in borrower 
credit risk.
 Second,

bank 
lending rates 
in the short term as banks temporarily absorb some fluctuations in their

The latest observation

s in 
the second quarter (see panel (a) of Chart 24). T
he deterioration in
 firms™ operating cash flows and the
 resulting 
high financing needs
 were 
temporarily mitigated
 as a result of
 the
 relaxation of lockdown measures in the third 
quarter, given lower COVID
-19 infection rates
. The
 slowdown in external financing 
was also related to firms building up liquidity buffers earlier in the year (from
 March
 to 
June
), leading to lower
 demand for credit
 in the third quarter. At the same time, the 
third quarter saw a surge in n
et issuance of listed shares
, but this was concentrated in 
a few firms, mainly in the 
technology
 sector
. 
Loan volume
s from non
-banks (non
-MFIs)
 remained subdued
 in the 
third
 quarter. 
Overall
, total external financing flows wer
e still 
higher in the 
third
 quarter of 2020 than 
the
 quarterly
 average observed between 2016 
and 2019
, on the back of 
favourable financing conditions
. The 
overall nominal cost of 
external financing for NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance in the market and 
equity finance, 
stood at
 4.5% at the end of October 
(see panel (b) of Chart 2
4). This 
level 
was around 
40 basis points 
lower than the March 2020
 local peak 
and 40 basis 
points higher than
 the historical low
 in J
une 2020. The decline between March and 
June was due to the sharp drop in the cost of equity and market
-based debt.
 Between 
the 
end of October
 and the end of the reference period (9 
December
 2020), the overall 
cost of financing is estimated to have declined by around 
15 basis points
, to 4.
4%, on 
account of a lower cost of both market
-based debt and equity.

 Fiscal
 developments
  42 6 Fiscal developments
 Substantial fiscal support, through both automatic stabilisers and discretionary 
measures by euro area governments, has mitigated the significant negative impact on 
the real economy from the 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandem
ic. The
 fiscal cost 
of this 
support 
has been very substantial for all euro area countries, although 
it 
var
ies
 markedly 
across countries. 
As a result of the economic downturn and the 
fiscal
 support, the general government budget deficit in the euro area is projected to
 increase significantly to 
8.0% of GDP in 2020
, according to the December 2020 staff 
macroeconomic projections
, 
from
 0.6% in 2019. 
Thereafter, the
 deficit ratio is 
expected to 
decline to 6.1% of GDP in 2021 and to 3.9% and 3.0% in the subsequent 
two years. The improvement is expected to be led by the phasing
-out of the 
emergency measures
, while the cyclical component will only improve significantly 
from 2022 onwards. Reflecting 
the fiscal measures and the deteriorating economic 
situation, the euro area aggregate debt ratio is estimated to have risen sharply in 2020 
and to
 peak in 2021
, declining
 only very slow
ly thereafter. 
An ambitious and 
coordinated fiscal stance remains criti
cal, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro 
area economy
 although f
iscal measures taken in response to the pandemic 
emergency should, as much as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature. At the 
same time, weak demand from firms and households an
d the heightened risk of a 
delayed recovery in the light of the new lockdowns owing to the second wave of the 
pandemic warrant continued support from national fiscal policies.
 The Next 
Generation EU (NGEU) fund, which complements the fiscal measures at the
 national 
level, will contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and will increase 
economic resilience and the growth potential of 
EU 
Member States™ economies
, particularly if
 the funds are deployed for productive public spending and accomp
anied 
by productivity
-enhancing
 structural policies.
 According to the 
December 2020 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic 
projections
, the euro area general government budget 
balance
 is projected to 
decline 
strongly in
 2020 and to recover gradually thereafter
.9 Based on these projections
, 
the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is expected 
to increase 
from 
0.6
% of GDP in 201
9 to 
8.0
% of GDP in 
2020, before declining to 6.1% in 2021 and 
further to 3.9% and 3.0% in 2022 and 2023 respectively (see Chart 25). 
The decline in 
the budget balance in 2020 is 
to a large extent attributable 
to
 a deterioration in the 
cyclically adjusted primary balance 
on the
 back of economic support measures 
amounting to around 4.5% of GDP, of which the largest part is additional spending, 
particularly in the form of transfers and subsidies to firms and households, including 
through short
-time work or furlough schemes. This d
ecline is also the result of 
a large 
negative cyclical component
, in line with a sharp deterioration of output in the euro 
area.
10 The subsequent improvement 
in the budget balance is initially projected to be 
driven by a recovery in the 
cyclically adjusted 
primary balance
 as part of the 
emergency measures is phased out from 2021. T
he contribution from the economic 
cycle is expected to 
improve 
significantly only from 2022 and remains negative 
                                                                    9  See
 the
 ﬁEurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, December 2020
ﬂ, 
published
 on 
the ECB™s website on 
10 December 2020.
 10  It should be noted that there is an unusually high degree of uncertainty surrounding the decomposition of 
cycle and trend at the current juncture.

wever, surrounded

, th
ese guarantees amount to 
around 17
% of GDP for the euro area as a 
whole, but the size of the envelopes differs substantially across countries. The loan 
guarantees 
are 
contingent liabilities for 
governments and any amount of guarantees 
called on will therefore constitute
 additional public s
pending
 that raises government 
debt.
 Compared with the 
September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections
, the 
euro area fiscal outlook is projected to be less negative in 2020 but more 
negative in both 2021 and 2022.
 The euro area general government budge
t balance 
as a share of GDP has been revised up by 0.8 percentage points for 2020 and down 
by 1.2 and 0.3 percentage points for 2021 and 2022 respectively. The lower fiscal 
deficit in 2020 is due mainly to a less negative cyclically adjusted balance but al
so to a 
slightly less negative cyclical component. This picture is expected to reverse over the 
next two years, when both the cyclically adjusted balance and the cyclical component 
should be more negative than previously expected.

11 The fiscal stance is estimated 
to have been mildly 
expansionary in 2019 but is expected to be highly accommo
dative at 4.8% of GDP in 
2020. By contrast, in 2021 and 2022 it is projected to tighten moderately by 1.5% and 
0.8% of GDP, respectively, and in 2023 to be broadly neutral. This path reflects a 
gradual phasing
-out of exceptional pandemic emergency measures
 from 2021 
onwards. Notwithstanding the gradual tightening, the overall fiscal balance will remain 
substantially negative, with fiscal instruments continuing to support the economic 
recovery over the whole forecast horizon.
 The euro area 
aggregate 
public d
ebt
-to-GDP ratio 
increased strongly in 
2020 and is 
projected 
to peak at around 100% in 2021, before declining very 
gradually.
 Debt ratio increases of 14.5 and 1.5 percentage points in 2020 and 
2021, respectively, l
argely reflect high primary deficits
 and, 
in 2020, v
ery a
dverse 
interest
-growth differentials. In 2020, the increase is also attributable to 
a significant deficit
-debt adjustment
 due to policy measures related to the 
pandemic
, such as liquidity support to firms and households. In 2022 and 2023, 
declining but still significant primary deficits will be more than offset by favourable 
contributions from improving interest
-growth differentials, as economic activity is 
projected to recover,
 and also by a negative deficit
-debt adjustment in 2022 
(see 
Char
t 26). 
As a result, the debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to stand at 97.8% at the 
end of the projection horizon in 2023.

 1 The scarring effects
 of 
past crises on 
the globa
l economy
 Prepared by Natalia Martín Fuentes
 and 
Isabella Moder
 The 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) pandemic is
 an 
unparalleled
 shock to the 
global
 economy
. First, the shock is multilayered, with the public health emergency 
compounded by an induced supply shock (i.
e. following the adoption of stringent 
lockdown measures) and a demand shock as a consequence of increased 
unemployment and heightened uncertainty. Second
, 
it has 
triggered a multifaceted 
and sizeable policy response, which has alleviated the
 adverse effects
 on economic 
activity but 
could exacerbate existing imbalances 
in the global economy 
and raise 
concerns about public 
and private 
debt overhangs and future deleveraging needs.
 Finally
, 
certain sectors have been hit particularly hard by the l
ockdown measures
 and behavioural changes 
on the part 
of consumers, which 
are likely to
 remain in place at 
least until an effective
 medical solution has been implemented.
 Given 
the
 complex nature of the COVID
-19 shock, the implications 
for 
the 
long
-term gro
wth potential of the global econom
y must be considered
. This box 
review
s past crises and the transmission channels through whi
ch potential output is 
affected.
13 The 
analysis is subject to high uncertainty, because
 potential output is an 
unobserved variable
. Furthermore, the COVID
-19 crisis is in many respects unique, 
and therefore past crises may not be reliable indicators of the lasting effects it may 
have on the global economy, not least because its length, one
 of the key parameters 
for assessing potential
 scarring effects, remains unknown.
 The traditional view 
that 
business cycle
 fluctuations do not influence long
-term 
growth 
has been disputed
 in the economic literature
. For example, the existence 
of labour market hysteresis effects (i.e. a persistent effe
ct of shocks on 
unemployment) is a phenomenon that has been widely examined and discussed.
14 Furthermore, recent literature contributions, m
otivated by the sluggish recovery after 
the global financial crisis, have shown that recessions cause persistent or ﬁ
scarringﬂ 
effects on the level of GDP
,15 as 
cyclical events affect the supply side of the economy 
through several channels
, 
thereby shaping the long
-term trend
.                                                                     13  See also the article entitled

 The
 scarring effects of past crises on the global economy
  47 Assessing the scarring effects of past crises does provide some indication as 
to how the COVID
-19 shock may affect potential output.
16 A local projections 
analysis of 
past epidemics
 suggests that the initial impact on the level of potential 
output 
is relatively short
-lived
, tending to dissipate 
two years after the end of the 
epidemic (
see 
Chart A, 
upper left panel).
 17 However
, it should be noted that the past 
epidemics 
considered in the analysis 
were mostly local
ised events which are not 
comparable to a major global pandemic.
18 Thus, 
the impact of two 
additional 
exogenous types of cris
is on potential
 output
 is assessed, namely the 
1973-74 oil 
embargo imposed by the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
 (OPEC)
, which can be regarded as an exogenous negative supply shock for the 
targeted 
countries
,19 and the effect of major wars
20. R
esults sug
gest that the oil embargo 
only 
had a 
negative 
effect
 on potential output in the first year after the shock (upper right 
panel). 
In turn, the results for m
ajor wars
 (lower left panel)
 suggest that
 following
 a severe 
initial impact
, 
post
-war economic recover
ies 
tend
 to be steep
 with no 
longer
-lasting scarring effects (i.e. beyond four years). However, the very wide 
confidence intervals point to sizeable heterogeneity in the long
-term impact of wars.
                                                                     16  The following results are based on local projections from a panel data model covering 117 countries from 
1970
 to 
2017. The independent variables represent cumulative potential output growth 
in each
 year. 
Regressors include autoregressive t
erms of four lags, dummies for the respective events as well as 
country
-fixed effects. Data sources 
are

sub

 compared with the co
untries 
not subject to the embargo
, the 
permanent 
rise in oil prices due to the oil price shocks in the 1970s, 
particularly
 the second oil price shock, 
may have 
had a more permanent effect on 
global potential output.

imated with a local projections

-fixed effects. As
 most of the epidemics 
considered in the analysis
 are relatively recent, the 
sample
 only
 allows their impact 
to be calculated
 until 
four years after the end 
of the epidemic
. Potential output is 
defined as the level of 
output that is consistent with the productive capacity of an economy
. In contrast, 
financial
 crises are associated with a very persistent downward 
shift in potential output.
 The
 results for past 
financial
 crises 
(as examples of 
endogenous crises, i.e. those triggered by the accumulation of economic imbalances)
 suggest 
a loss of around 5% even after eight years, in line with the recent literature 
discussed above. 
This is supported by the fact that,
 for recessions caused by financial 
crises, no overshooting in growth rates can be observed after the end of the recession, 
pointing to 
long
-lasting scarring effects on the level of potential output
 (see Chart B). 
This is different from the exogenous crises (i.e. 
epidemics
, the OPEC embargo and 
wars), where the initial contraction is 
followed by above
-normal growth
 rates
, bringing 
the economy™s potential output ba
ck to its long

 Evidence shows that 
in recessions following financial crises, 
the impact
 of the 
crisis
 was particularly
 persistent for the capital stock.
21 It is useful to assess the 
impact of past financial crises on the individual components of potential output. A
ll three 
supply
-side 
compon
ents
 of the production function 
are
 initially
 affected by a
 financial 
crisis (
see 
Chart C). While the negative impact on 
total factor productivity
 and 
labour input starts to subside after 
approximately
 three years, the
re are
 adverse and 
persistent 
effects 
on the capital stock, which is the main source of the long
-term 
scarring effects of financial crises.
                                                                     21  In line with the short
-lived impact on potential growth discussed above, the impact of epidemics, the 
OPEC embargo and wars on the individual components of the supply side is 
either 
short
-lived or not 
significant at all
 and is therefore n
ot discussed further here
. The only exception is the
 adverse
 impact of 
epidemics on labour supply (including human capital), which 
intensifies
 over time. The results for 
epidemics 
are broadly similar to
 the results of 
recent research by the World Bank. See

 Capital depreciation
 is likely to have increased as a result of

industry
, where parts of the capital stock 
could
 become obsolete, 
as well as
 in other

 Potential output is defined as the level of output that is consistent with the productive capacity of 
an economy.
 As the COVID
-19 shock 
has above all 
hit labour
-intensive s
ectors, the initial 
impact on labour supply 
could 
be stronger compared 
with
 past 
financial 
crises.
 With the exception of transport, the sectors most affected by the 
COVID
-19 containment measures 
(i.e. retail trade, accommodation and food services, 
entertai
nment and recreation) tend to be more labour than capital
-intensive (
see 
Chart 
D). 
At the same time, even sectors not targeted by the lockdown measures may have 
been hit indirectly through reduced sales of intermediate goods to affected sectors.
23 Whether t
hose 
employment 
losses will become more permanent will depend on the 
speed of 
the
 reallocation of workers across sectors and firms. 
Pandemic
-related 
labour market consequences
, such as a reduction in the labour force due to an 
increase in the number of dis
couraged workers 
or more limited global migration flows
 to advanced economies, 
might 
lead to a sustained contraction in the labour force. This 
                                                                    22  In the first half of 2020 global investment (excluding the euro area) dropp
ed by around 11%, which is 
more than after the global financial crisis: between the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, 
global investment decreased by a cumulative 8%. A
ccording to OECD projections, 
global investment will 
still be 4% lower
 in the fourth quarter of 2021 than in the fourth quarter of 2019 (the numbers are based 
on an unweighted average of Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United 
States). See ﬁ

accumulation of human capital

 exacerbate the loss in labour supply

 Finally, while t
he COVID
-19 crisis 
could
 also have a negative impact 
on 
productivity
, the push towards digital technologies might be positive in the 
longer term
. The COVID
-19 crisis could affect 
total factor productivity in several 
ways. First, 
the impact of COVID
-19 could
 temporarily lock resources in unproductive 
sectors
, with the reallocation of productive resources 
towards fast
-growing industries
 likely to take time
.26 In addition, i
nnovation 
could
 be impaired through lower spending 
on research and development
, both 
in the 
public 
sector
 on account of consolidation 
needs and 
in the 
private 
sector
 owing
 to elevated uncertainty. Furthermore, reshoring 
of global value chains in the aftermath of the COVID
-19 crisis 
could
 hamper innovation 
and knowledge spillovers across countries. 
At the same time
, the increased use of 
digital technologies 
spurred
 by the COVID
-19 crisis 
has the potential to
 accelerate the 
                                                                    24  See Burgess

 26  Once this has taken place, however, aggregate productivity might benefit from such a reallocation of 
resources 
towards more productive sectors
. Additionally, the COVID
-19 shock might have a stronger 
impact on low
-productivity firms, which could in principle have a positive effect on aggregate productivity.

2020  53 2 Liquidity conditions and mo
netary policy operations in the 
period from 22 July to 3 November 2020
 Prepared by Simon Forsyth and Ross Murphy
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations and liquidity 
developments during the fifth and sixth reserve maintenance periods of 2020, 
which ran from 22 July to 
15 September
 and from 
16 September to 
3 November 
2020, respectively
. During this 
period, there was a stabilisation of the market volatility 
associated with the coronavirus (COVID
-19) crisis earlier in the year. Measures 
announced by central banks continued to underpin mark
et functioning over the 
summer.
 The levels of central bank liqui
dity in the banking system continued to rise 
during the fifth and sixth maintenance periods of 2020.
 This was largely due to the 
settlement of the 
third series of 
targeted long
er-term refinancing operations (TLTRO 
III) 
and asset purchases conducted under t
he asset purchase programme (APP) and 
the pandemic emerg
ency purchase programme (PEPP).
 Liquidity needs
 The banking system™s average daily liquidity needs, defined as the sum of net 
autonomous factors and reserve requirements, stood at •2,044.5 billion in 
the 
period under review.
 This was •109.8 billion higher than 
the average 
in the third and 
fourth maintenance periods of 2020 (see the section of Table
 A entitled ﬁOther 
liquidity
-based informationﬂ). Net autonomous factors increased by •107.3 billion to 
•1,901.6 billion, while minimum reserve requirements increased by •2.6 billion to 
•142.9 billion.
 In the period under review, g
overnment deposits remained by far the main 
liquidity 
absorbing factor
. Government deposits 
continued their upward trend, 
although 
the pace of increase slowed compared with the previous period. They 
increased on average by •146.7 billion to •727.9 billion. Euro area government 
deposits stood at record highs, making up more than 11% of the Eurosystem™s balance 
sheet on average during t
he review period, compared with around 9% during the 
previous review period
 and 6% in the first two maintenance periods of the year
. 
Liquidity 
providing factors increased by 
•41.6 billion, offsetting only partially the 
effect 
of increased government deposi
ts
. In particular, net assets denominated in euro 
increased by •83.7 billion, 
which was partly 
offset by a 
•42.1 billion 
reduction in net 
foreign assets 
(see the section of Table A entitled ﬁAssetsﬂ).
 On the whole
, 
during
 the period under review, the 
overa
ll supply of 
liquidity 
through
 monetary policy operations 
continued to be well in excess of 
the liquidity absorption 
induced by
 net autonomous factors

 Note: The latest observation is for 3 November 2020.
 The average amount of liquidity provided through 
Eurosystem credit

the 
review period, 
largely as a 
result of the 
settlement of the fourth and fifth operations in TLTRO III.
 The 
average increase of •890.8 billi
on provided through TLTRO III was partially offset by 
maturity 
and/or voluntary repayments under TLTRO II, as counterparties shifted to 
TLTRO III, the terms of which are more financial
ly convenient, and the 
maturing 
of the 
bridge 
longer
-term refinancing op
erations (
LTRO
s). On average, repayments under 
the TLTRO II programme amounted to •242.4 billion. The bridge LTROs, introduced 
on 12 March 2020 as a transition instrument to provide immediate access to funding at 
particularly favourable conditions
, while a
llowing for a smoother rollover of funds into 
TLTRO III, also matured as counterparties transitioned to TLTRO 
III, 
contributing an 
overall amount of 
•228.6 billion. During the review period, the ECB also conducted the 
third, fourth and fifth (out of a tota
l of seven) new pandemic emergency longer
-term 
refinancing operations (PELTROs), which were announced in April 2020. These 
operations 
are 
aimed at supporting the smooth functioning of money markets by 
providing an effective backstop to money market rates. 
The PELTROs added •7.5 
billion in liquidity. The main refinancing operation
s (MRO
s) and three
-month LTROs 
played only a marginal role, recording an average aggregate increase of •0.1 billion 
compared with the previous review period.
 At the same time, 
outright portfolios increased by •308.8 billion to •3,394.6
 billion, owing to the continuation of net purchases under the APP and the PEPP.
 Average holdings in the PEPP amounted to •527.3 billion, representing an increase of 
•242.0 billion 
relative 
to the 
previous review period. Purchases under the PEPP 
represented the largest increase by far across all asset purchase programmes, 
followed by the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and the corporate sector 
purchase programme (CSPP), with average increase
s of •53.1 billion to •2,283.2 
billion and •15.3 billion to •232.3 billion, respectively.

 Prepared by Niccolò Battistini, Gabe de Bondt, Roberto 
A. De Santis 
and Lorena Saiz
 The 
sudden and 
deep recession 
triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) has 
warranted adjusting the standard tools used for forecasting
 euro area real GDP growth in real time
. The severe economic consequences of 
COVID
-19 have played havoc with established statistical and economic 
relationships.
29 Hence, standard short
-term forecasting models have been able to 
capture neither the extent of the contraction observed in the first two quarters of 2020 
Œ with quarter
-on-quarter declines of 3.7% and 11.7% in the first and the second 
quarters, respectively 
Œ nor the rebound in the third quarter 
Œ with an increase of 
12.5%. These exceptional dynamics have 
required 
an update of the set of tools
 typically 
used to 
forecast euro
 area real GDP growth in real time
. This box describes 
four approaches developed by ECB staff 
to account fo
r the specific characteristics and 
implications of the COVID
-19 pandemic.
 The first approach exploits the information content of the different contai
nment 
measures implemented across countries.
 A simple
 methodology assesses
 the 
economic impact 
of the 
restrictions on people™s behaviour 
imposed in several 
countries 
to 
contain 
the 
pandemic
.30 A pooled panel regression, the so
-called 
ﬁpandemic cross
-country
 modelﬂ, gauges 
the 
relationship between
 containment 
measures
, as measured
 by th
e Oxford Stringency Index (OSI),
 and real GDP.
31 Based 
on data for the first three quarters of 2020 across all euro area countries, a linear 
model seems to fit reasonably well t
he cross
-country heterogeneity in the relationship 
between real GDP and the OSI (see Chart A). Real
-time estimates of the pandemic 
cross
-country model indicated a quarterly contraction in euro area real GDP of 7.9% in 
the second quarter and a pick
-up of 6.
3% in the third quarter of 2020 (see Chart B).
                                                                     29  See also Lenza, M. and Primiceri, G.E., ﬁ

s. Notes: The line in the chart indicates the linear trend (i.e. the fitted values) of the pooled panel
 regression based on data for the 19 euro 
area countries in the first three quarters of the year
. The slope coefficient provides the estimated elasticity of the OSI on real GDP
. The second approach exploits the information content of high
-frequency 
indicators
, as these indicators are able to quickly capture sudden changes in 
economic conditions
. While
 monthly 
indicators are
 very informative about 
the 
current economic juncture
, they are released with some delay. Non
-standard
 daily or 
weekly
 data (e.g. 
credit card payments, 
electricity consumption 
and mobility
 indicators) have 
provided a 
timel
ier
 picture
 of the economic impact of the pandemic
. However
, as the
se data 
can be
 noisy, 
only 
available for a 
limited
 period of time and 
subject to 
complex seasonal patterns, they need 
to be viewed with caution.
32 Taking 
into account the
se measureme
nt challenges, 
the 
standa
rd toolkit
 for short
-term 
forecasting of euro area real GDP 
has been 
expanded to include
 information on 
weekly 
credit
 card payments.
33 This additional information, 
partly 
captur
ing
 real
-time 
developments in the 
two GDP components that are more severel
y affected by the 
pandemic (i.e. production in the 
service
s sector
 on the supply side and private 
consumption on the expenditure side),
 has improved the forecast performance of the 
standard 
short
-term forecast 
models
. Unlike the mild contraction and recove
ry 
suggested by the standard models, the adjusted short
-term forecast models pointed to 
an average contraction in euro area real GDP of 7.0% in the second quarter of 2020 
and to a swift rebound of 8.4% in the third quarter (see Chart B)
.                                                                     32  See Hinge

(2020), IHS Markit, ECB, ECB staff calculations.
 Notes: The adjusted short
-term forecast model includes information from w
eekly credit card payments and other standard indicators 
which were available 15 days before the release of the preliminary flash estimate of GDP. The adjusted PMI GDP tracker refers
 to a 
non-linear PMI composite output
-based rule, which takes into account
 both the quarterly change in this index and previous GDP growth. 
The 
GDP
-at-risk 
model 
uses the 5% left tail of the conditional distribution for the 
second quarter
 of 2020 and, given the expected sharp 
rebound, the 1% right tail of the conditional distrib
ution for the third quarter of 2020.
 All 
of 
the reported real GDP 
fore
casts are 
real
-time
 estimates.
 The third approach consists of adjusting the linear relationship between GDP 
and the Purchasing Manager™s Index (PMI).
 The survey
-based 
PMI composite 
outpu
t is a monthly diffusion index bounded between 0 and 100, with 50 indicating no 
output 
change
 over the previous month for firms in the manufacturing and services 
sectors
. 
Prior to the pandemic, a
 PMI 
linear 
rule 
(i.e. a so
-called ﬁreal GDP trackerﬂ) 
had wo
rked
 reasonably 
well 
for
 forecast
ing
 quarter
-on-quarter euro area real GDP 
growth
.34 However, this relationship has become dysfunctional
 since the start of 
the 
COVID
-19 crisis. Two types of adjustments were implemented to extract all possible 
information content from the PMI. The first adjustment consisted of considering only 
the left tail of the distribution of real GDP growth for the first two quarters of 2020. The 
resu
lting adjusted PMI
-based tracker rule forecasted, in real time, a decline in euro 
area 
real GDP 
of 2.7% in the first quarter and of 9.8% 
in the 
second quarter. The PMI 
linear rule was also expected to fail in terms of estimating the expected elastic 
reboun
d in the third quarter. Therefore, the second adjustment made consisted of also 
extracting information from the change in the PMI and taking GDP growth from the 
previous quarter as the starting point.
35 This adjustment implied an estimated rebound 
of 6.1% i
n the third 
quarter 
of 2020 (see Chart B)
.                                                                     34  The linear
 PMI rule 
means th
at 
real GDP growth equals 10% of the 
(quarterly average of
 the) difference 
of the 
PMI from 50.

 that real GDP growth equals 
real GDP growth in the previous quarter multiplied by the ratio of a 
PMI

equal to 
15% of the (quarterly average of) the differ
ence of the PMI from 50

D-19  62 The 
final approach extracts information from 
tail events
 using a non
-linear 
model
. Economic variables react heterogeneously in periods of recessions and 
expansions. To address the non
-linearity of the response, we
 used the 
GDP
-at-risk 
model, which employs 
quantile regressions to link each 
real 
GDP growth quantile (e.g.
 the
 5th percentile) to selected macro
 (e.g. the PMI composite output) 
and financial 
variables
.36 With regard to the latter, 
the Composite Indicator o
f Systemic Stress 
(CISS) and corporate spreads 
serve 
as prox
y measures of
 financial stress and risk 
premi
a. 
The 
expected value of real GDP growth at the 
5% left tail of the conditional 
distribution
 was used to forecast 
the exceptional contraction of activi
ty in the first two 
quarters of 2020
. 
Conversely, the
 expected value
 at the 1% right tail of the conditional 
distribution was employed to map the unprecedented rebound in real GDP growth in 
the third quarter.
 In line with the nature of tail events
, 
the dyn
amics of economic 
activity in the first three quarters of 2020 were reasonably well captured in real time by 
the extreme quantiles of the distribution of
 real GDP growth (see Chart C)
. The 
expected values of these densities computed under the said tails ch
aracterise the 
forecasts by the GDP
-at-risk model. These values indicated dramatic declines in euro 
area real GDP of 2.9% and 11.8% in the first and the second quarters of 2020, 
respectively, followed by a marked rise of 7.6% in the third quarter (see Char
t B).

the second and the third quarters of 2020. The second two approaches reflected the 
extent of the collapse in activity in the second quarter rather well, albeit they did not 
completely account for the robust rebound in the third 
quarter, likely owing to the 
asymmetric reaction by the PMI.
 The 
use of non

caution
. On the one hand, s
ome
 of the 
tools share th
e ad hoc nature 
of the 
assessment (e.g. selection of extreme quantiles
) and of the adjustments to the model 
specifications
 (e.g. PMI GDP tracker)
 to capture the effects of the crisis. On the other 
hand, some of the non
-standard data (e.g. high

 indicators
,

complex 
seasonal patterns or very short 
samples. This implies that the use of each individual tool 
is subject to 
a considerable
 degree
 of judgment
, particularly
 as to
 the type of adjustment needed.
 Some of these 
tools are specifically tailored to the pandemic shock and may become redundant as 
economic dynamics normalise. Despite their shortcomings, these tools have 
significantly improved upon the standard toolkit used for the assessment of euro area 
real GDP in real time and will continue to be employed to inform the judgment 
exercised and included in the ECB staff macroeconomic projections and needed to 
assess the impact of the second wave of the pandemic on the economy.

  64 4 Understanding the impact of
 the COVID
-19 pandemic
 through
 an import
-adjusted breakdown
 of euro area 
aggregate demand
 Prepared by Malin Andersson, Leyla Beck and Yiqiao Sun
 This box presents an alternative method for breaking down GDP
, accounting for 
the fact 
that each demand component contains goods and services
 which are 
imported.
 The standard breakdown of GDP into 
domestic 
expenditure components 
and net exports enables an assessment to be made of the domestic versus foreign 
drivers of growth. Such a breakdown traditionally 
subtracts the contribution of total 
imports as a stand
-alone aggregate from total exports
 to compute net exports
. 
In 
reality, however, 
imports contribute to all individual components of GDP
, i.e. also to 
changes in inventories and to domestic demand, and more so to investment than to 
private a
nd government consumption
. This standard national accounting practice 
therefore has a limitation in that it
 magnifies the purely domestic demand contribution 
to GDP growth while shrinking the 
influence of 
foreign 
factors 
on domestic economic 
activity.
 With
 an import
-adjusted GDP measure, imports are allocated to each
 expenditure
 component and deducted separately from it on the basis of its 
respective import intensity.
 This alternative method can shed light on two, otherwise 
hidden, propagation mechanisms 
at play
 during the coronavirus (COVID
-19) shock. 
First, it 
takes account of
 the impact of direct and intermediate 
extra
-euro area 
imports 
on domestic demand 
Œ which h
as 
also suffered from global lockdown measures 
Œ by 
considering
 actual
 import intensities at
 the component level. Second, it highlights the 
role of external factors in exports, which becomes more visible when 
only the share of 
extra
-euro area imports 
associated with exports is netted out from 
total extra
-euro 
area exports. This box presents evide
nce 
for
 the importance of import intensities in the 
decomposition of euro area economic growth dynamics during the pandemic. It then 
describes an extended analysis based on sectoral proxies to adjust for possible 
changes in import intensities across expend
iture components
 in the pandemic period.
 A breakdown
 of euro area GDP
 adjusted for
 extra
-euro area
 import intensities
38 shows that the import content of domestic demand has been an important 
factor amplifying domestic demand dynamics in 2020.
 On the basis of the 
traditional national accounting definition of GDP, euro area domestic demand 
contributed 14.
0 percentage points to the cumulated 15.
0% decline in euro area 
output in the first half of 2020 and 
11.3
 percentage points to the 12.
5% quarte
r-on-quarter increase in the third quarter of 2020 (see Chart A, panel a). An 
adjustment of expenditure components
 in 2020
 for the import intensities prevailing in 
2019 shows a more limited contribution to the economic losses in the first half of the 
                                                                    38  The import

  65 year 
for the purely domestic demand
 component
, and a larger contribution 
for 
export
s (see 
Chart A, panel b). In the subsequent rebound, domestic demand surged less on 
this basis than according to the traditional breakdown. Overall, the comparison reveals 
that, 
owing to input
-output linkages, the euro area economy has been more heavily 
exposed to external shocks during the pandemic than suggested by the traditional 
breakdown.
39 This is because, through global value chains, imports are intrinsically 
dependent on do
mestic production patterns. Moreover, external shocks can 
propagate and be magnified because of complementarities across sectors that may 
arise from the presence of input
-output linkages.
40 The direct and intermediate import 
intensities of GDP components ca
n be calculated on the basis of Eurostat™s annual 
input
-output data
41 for the euro area, available for the period 
from 
2005 to
 2019. The 
resulting estimates show that 
the 
import intensity has been particularly high for exports 
and investment, somewhat lower
 for private consumption and particularly low for 
government consumption expenditure (see Chart B, panel a). It is also considerably 
higher for manufacturing than for services.

weights to estimate the true

 extra

private 
consumption, 
government consumption, in
vestment 
and exports.
 As the import share 
in changes in inventories cannot
 be calculated, a
n import share of 
50% is assumed
. Third, the 
estimated import flows are deducted separately from each expenditure component
, both in nominal and real terms,
 and the 
import
-adjusted contribution of each component to growth 
is computed. Note that total
 nominal
 import flows calculated from input

 Understandin
g the impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic through an import
-adjusted breakdown 
of euro area aggregate demand
  67 During the COVID
-19 pandemic the extra
-euro area import intensity of 
manufacturing appears to 
have increased somewhat, while that of services has 
fallen.
 As Eurostat™s input and output data are not yet available for 2020, we use 
instead the ratio of sector
-level 
extra
-euro area imports 
to
 value added
 in the main 
sectors as a proxy for the respectiv
e import intensities in order to evaluate the possible 
impact of the pandemic up to the third quarter of 2020
.44 Interestingly, 
these
 data 
show that
, overall 
during the pandemic
, i.e. including the third
-quarter rebound,
 the 
manufacturing sector saw a
 prono
unced 
loss
 in value added following the supply 
shock from economy
-wide lockdowns, while the 
reduction in
 imports was smaller. This 
implies that import intensity rose in the manufacturing sector (
see 
Chart B, panel b).
 For the services sector, 
by contrast, 
the overall loss in extra
-euro area imports
 for the 
period exceeded the loss in
 value added, as tourism
 and travel
45 had a particularly 
adverse impact on imports. Since the manufacturing sector 
accounts for 
a much larger 
share 
than the services sector
 of th
e import content 
across 
all expenditure 
components, 
overall 
import intensities increased during the first 
three
 quarters of 
2020. However, this 
possible 
rise in import content would not have a significant impact 
on the outcome 
of the import
-adjusted GDP br
eakdown compared with that
 shown in 
Chart A
, panel b
. To conclude, using import intensities to disentangle domestic and external 
contributions to euro area growth suggests that the external contribution in the 
first 
three
 quarters of 2020 was larger
 in abs
olute terms
 than suggested by the 
traditional breakdown
, while the role of 
domestic demand 
was smaller
. A proxy 
based on recent data capturing changes in the contributions from the manufacturing 
and services sectors during the pandemic suggests that import
 intensities 
could 
have 
risen 
in aggregate
 during the crisis. However, this change in import content would not 
have a significant impact on the import
-adjusted breakdown.
                                                                       44  More will be known on the evolution of import intensities

COVID
-19 
pandemic
 Prepared by Vanessa
 Gunnella,
 Georgi
 Krustev
 and
 Tobias
 Schuler
 A salient feature of the coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic has been the 
sharp 
and deep 
decline in mobility
, which has
 caused
 a slump in tourism, trade in 
travel services and consumption by non
-residents.
 Lockdowns and social 
distancing
 measures
 led to strong declines in otherwise stable services consumption. 
This box 
takes stock of developments in the tourism sector, 
discusses 
how the impact 
of these developments on consumption has varied across 
countr
ies
 and reviews the 
near-term prospects for a 
recovery in tourism and travel.
 The slump in tourism and travel
, reflecting restrictions and uncertainties 
related to people™s movement across borders (e.g. 
owing
 to quarantine
 measures
), led to a collapse in cons
umption by non
-residents
. The effects 
of th
is 
collapse
 can be 
seen
 by looking at the difference 
between 
domestic 
consumption 
and 
national consumption (
see panel (a) of 
Chart
 A). T
he former includ
es consumption of 
non-residents
, whereas
 the latter only
 incl
udes that of residents
.46 For 
example,
 in 
Italy and Spain, domestic consumption by non
-residents plummeted by more than 
90% year
 on year in the second quarter of 2020
, and similar declines were recorded in 
consumption expenditure 
of residents of the
se count
ries abroad, significantly 
exceeding th
e fall in national consumption.
 Because of the decline in
 cross
-border travel, consumption gaps 
Œ the excess 
of domestic
 consumption
 over national consumption 
owing
 to net expenditures 
by non
-residents
 Œ almost
 closed
 in the second quarter of 2020 (see 
panel (b) of 
Chart A).
47 In other words, tourism has worked as a shock amplification channel 
during
 the 
COVID
-19 pandemic
 in count
ries which are net exporters of
 travel services
 (i.e. countries which receive a lot of 
tourists, such as Spain, Greece and Portugal)
, as 
they experienced a sharp contraction of domestic private consumption, and as a 
shock cushioning channel in countries which are net importers of travel services (e.g. 
Germany).
48 More specifically, in net cre
ditors of travel services, the collapse of 
non-resident consumption expenditure caused domestic consumption to fall 
by 
more 
than national consumption, 
whereas the opposite occurred
 in countries which were 
net debtors of travel services 
before
 the onset of 
the 
COVID
-19 pandemic
. This 
pattern is also 
reflected in
 the 
sharp deterioration of the 
travel trade balance of the
 countries which are net exporters of travel services and in the improvement of the 
balance of net importers
 (see 
panel (a) of 
Chart A). Avai
lable data for 
the 
third quarter

 national concept of private consumption expenditure (PCE) captures private consumption 
expenditure of the residents of a country, irrespective of whether such expenditure occurs domestically or 
abroad. National PCE is the concept used to report households
™ total private consumption on the 
expenditure side of GDP in the national accounts. Domestic PCE augments the national PCE concept by 
the net balance of foreign residents™ expenditure domestically minus domestic residents™ expenditure 
abroad. For further 
information on the differences between these concepts, see Box 1 of the article 
entitled ﬁ

ants
. The 
reintroduction of travel restrictions since October will likely imply that the substitution 
of foreign tourism with domestic tourism will continue to affect the dynamics of tourism 
services in the near term.
 The latest restrictions may also alter
 the geographical 
impact of the crisis on the sector, as winter tourism destinations will be more severely 
affected this time.
 Forward
-looking indicators point to a renewed deterioration 
of the tourism 
sector as restrictions are 
reintroduced (
see 
Chart 
C). Owing to
 travel bans
, restrictions and renewed lockdown measures (
shown
 by the green line), travel 
decreased after the summer and confidence effects are weighing strongly on 
                                                                    49  Financial incentive

  72 6 The long
-term effects of the pandemic: insights from a 
survey of leadi
ng companies
 Prepared by Eduardo Maqui and Richard Morris
 This box summarises the findings of an ad hoc ECB survey of leading euro area 
companies 
that 
look
s at the long
-term effects of the 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic on the economy.
 While precipitating the largest short
-term decline in 
economic activity 
for
 centuries, the 
COVID
-19 pandemic has also 
brought about
 changes in the way businesses operate and consumers behave, some of which are 
likely to outlive the 
present crisis
. These ma
y in turn influence aggregates such as 
output, employment and prices 
Œ and the relationship between them 
Œ in 
the 
long
 term.
51 The main aim of 
the
 survey was to find out 
how leadi
ng euro area 
firms perceive
 the long
-term impact of the 
COVID
-19 pandemic on t
heir business.
 For the 
purpose of the survey, we defined long
 term as ﬁa new normal when
, owing
 Œ for 
example
 Œ to the development of a vaccine and/or more effective treatment, the 
economy will no longer be subject to significant disruption and/or abrupt c
hange due to 
the virus or the measures needed to contain itﬂ. The survey was split into three parts. 
The first part 
ask
ed what long
-term effects, if any, the 
COVID
-19 pandemic was 
expected to have on the respondents
™ business
, e.g.
 in terms of business org
anisation 
or the markets 
they
 operate in
. The second part asked respondents to indicate 
whether they agreed or disagreed with a set of statements
 on narratives 
for
 the 
pandemic
-induced ﬁnew normal
ﬂ. The third part asked about the expected long
-term 
impact 
on aggregates 
such as 
sales, employment
 and prices. Responses were 
received from 72 leading non
-financial companies, split around 60% to 40% between 
ﬁindustrialsﬂ and ﬁservicesﬂ. When interpreting the results, it should be borne in mind 
that the size and d
istribution of 
the 
activities of these firms most likely makes them 
better able to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic than 
other firms
. More remote working and an acceleration of 
digital
isation
 were the 
most 
frequently cited 
long
-term 
supply
-side 
effects
 of the pandemic
. Respondents 
were asked to briefly explain, in order of importance, up to three ways in which the 
pandemic would have a long
-term impact on their business, for example in relation to 
business organisation or the markets 
they operate in. Chart A summarises the 
responses received to this open question. More than 40% of respondents cited 
increased use of the ﬁhome officeﬂ, while almost as many said that the pandemic had 
led their company to accelerate the adoption of digital
 technologies, which will change 
the way they operate in the long term. Around one
-fifth of respondents cited a more 
permanent reduction in business travel and/or increase in virtual meetings, and a 
similar number pointed to increased e
-commerce or 
Œ in bu
siness
-to
-business 
segments 
Œ ﬁvirtual sellingﬂ. Around one
-fifth highlighted the fact that actions taken in 
response to the pandemic would make their business more resilient and/or more 
flexible in the long term.
                                                                     51  For a recent study of the long

  73 A significant share of respondents cited r

and

 changes in 
the 
structure of 
demand 
as particular concerns
. Almost 30% cited reduced demand for 
their products or services as one of the main long
-term consequences of the pandemic 
for their business, while more than 20% pointed to last
ing changes in the structure of 
demand. To a large extent, this seems to reflect a view that some changes in living and 
working habits brought about by the pandemic, especially the increased conduct of 
business and consumption online and a consequent reduc
tion in travel, will become 
embedded.

as 
changing consumer behaviour in the long

 to increased market concentration, while having much less

 Three

consumer behaviour 
as a 
result 
of the pandemic would affect demand for their main 
product

in the long

increased market concentration in their sector (compared 
with
 one-quarter who 
disagreed with this statement), with mergers exp
ected to play a greater role than firm
s exit
ing the market
. When asked about the long
-term effect of the pandemic on supply 
chains, among those firms for whom these questions were relevant, a majority 
disagree
d that their supply chain would become more diversified or localised
; 
an overwhelming majority did not see their business seeking to internalise more parts of 
the supply chain.
 Most respondents considered that the pandemic would have a positive 
long

a negative impact on employment.
 When 
asked to assess the overall long

 Assessing

  76 7 Assessing wage dynamics during the COVID
-19 
pandemic: can
 data on
 negotiated wages help?
 Prepared by Gerrit Koester, Nicola Benatti and Aurelian Vlad 
 The confluence of the economic consequences of and policy responses to the 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic poses challenges for interpreting labour 
market developments 
Œ including wage developme
nts.
 For instance, the 
substantial changes observed in recent quarters in hours worked per person 
employed, together with the widespread application of short
-time work schemes and 
issues related to their statistical recording, complicate the interpretation
 of wage 
indicators such as ﬁcompensation per hourﬂ or ﬁcompensation per employeeﬂ.
53 The 
ECB indicator of negotiated wage rates
 captures the outcome of collective bargaining 
processes and is not directly affected by these special factors.
54 It also tends to
 be published around one month earlier than wage indicators based on quarterly national 
accounts. It should be noted, however, that the pandemic may also have had an 
impact on the indicator properties of negotiated wages
, as it has led to fewer wage 
agreem
ents being concluded than under normal circumstances. This box 
considers
 what role the indicator of negotiated wage rates can play in assessing and forecasting 
wage developments at the current juncture.
 While the data
 on negotiated wages
 are available on a
 more timely basis, 
negotiated wage growth tends to 
only 
react 
with some lag 
to changes in labour 
market conditions.
 It usually takes time for changes in unemployment reflecting 
tightness in the labour market to be reflected in wage negotiations. The indic
ator of 
negotiated wage rates therefore tends to respond to cyclical labour market 
developments with a time lag of 
several
 quarters (see Chart A). This is 
a result of
 bargaining processes in large euro area countries (which mostly take place at the 
sectora
l level)
, with 
a variety of start dates and durations,
 that often set wages for 
periods longer than one year.
 In line with this institutional feature, recent 
developments in negotiated wage growth do not point to the pandemic
-related labour 
market upheaval
s having had a major impact as yet. While year
-on-year growth 
decreased to 1.9%, 1.7% and 1.6% in the first, second and third quarters of 2020 
respectively, this in part reflects base effects 
Œ meaning that, for example, the low 
reading in the third quarte
r of 2020 is
 in part
 related to the upward impact in the third 
quarter of 2019 associated with special 
payments
 in Germany at that time.
55                                                                     53  These issues have been discussed in
 past issues of the ECB™s Economic Bulletin. See the box entitled

-hand scale: annual percentage changes; 
right
-hand scale: percentages)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2020. The right
-hand scale is inverted
. Wage agreements concluded before the outbreak of the pandemic still play a 
dominant 
role in the latest developments in the indicator of negotiated wage 
rates.
 Quarter
-on-quarter changes in the indicator show that negotiated wage 
dynamics in 2020 have so far been very much in line with the profile observed on 
average since 1999 (see Chart 
B). Changes to negotiated wages tend to occur mainly 
in the first quarter of each year. This holds true both
 for
 average changes in the 
indicator of negotiated wage rates 
and for average absolute change
s. The fact that 
average absolute changes in the indic
ator of negotiated wages, which reflect the 
average absolute amount of increases as well as decreases, are also concentrated in 
the first quarter shows that changes to negotiated wages do indeed occur mainly at 
the beginning of each year
. More granular inf
ormation suggests that nearly all of the 
increase in negotiated wages in the first quarter of 2020 was attributable to wage 
increases in January, 
i.e. 
before the pandemic hit. The dominant role of wage 
agreements at the start of each year implies that the 
main effects of the pandemic on 
negotiated wages might only start to become visible in early 2021, when a large share 
of wage contracts is due for renegotiation in several euro area countries.

 Seasonal pattern of changes in negotiated wages
 (quarte
r-on-quarter percentage changes; period analysed: 1999
-2020 unless otherwise indicated)
  Sources: ECB internal estimates and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The latest observation is for the third quarter 2020.
 Absolute changes are derived by adding up the absol
ute amounts of increases 
and decreases.
 At this juncture, some forward
-looking information may be embedded in the 
wage drift.
 The wage drift can be derived as the difference between growth rates of 
actual pay, as measured by gross wages and salaries per em
ployee, and growth rates 
of negotiated wages.
56 Based on this approach, the negative wage drift in the first 
three quarters of 
2020 (see Chart C) captures the fact that firms™ actual wage bill was 
generally lower owing to the government support measures and
 also
 fewer bonuses 
and promotions, among other factors
. However, this calculation of the wage drift 
is inevitably 
affected by
 shifts in the composition of employment and in the average 
hours worked per person employed 
Œ and these shifts
 are very substanti
al at the 
current juncture. The composition of employment is likely to have changed
, as the 
pandemic has 
caused job losses in
 the service sector
 in particular
, which has relatively 
more low
er-paying jobs, thereby mechanically increasing the average pay and
 partly 
offsetting the otherwise negative impacts on the aggregate wage drift.
57 The wage 
drift signals the downward pressure that may emerge for negotiated wages should the 
situation in the labour market deteriorate, with workers who are currently on reduc
ed hours instead becoming unemployed.
                                                                     56  This implies that headline wage growth as measured by compensation per employee can be broken 
down into negotiated wage growth, the wage drift and the impact of changes in social security 
contributions, where the latter is defined as the difference between the annual rate of growth in 
compensation per employee and the annual rate of growth in gross
 wages and salaries per employee.

wage growth.
 The main effects of the pandemic on negotiated wage growth are likely 
to become visible only from 2021
, when
 a substan
tial share of wage contracts in euro 
area countries
 is due to be renegotiated
. Wage drift developments, in conjunction with 
information on hours worked and unemployment, can provide some indications 
regarding the environment in which these negotiations tak
e place. The availability of 
more granular data, for example on negotiated wage growth in different sectors, would 
be very helpful in analysing euro area wage developments in more detail.

 Draft

  80 8 Draft budgetary plans for 2021: a review in times of the 
COVID
-19 
crisis
 Prepared by Stephan Haroutunian, Sebastian Hauptmeier and Steffen 
Osterloh
 On 18 November
 2020 the European Commission 
released its opinions on the 
draft budgetary plans of euro area governments for 2021.
 In
 contrast to previous 
years and in the con
text of the coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic, 
this year™s 
European 
Commission assessment 
was of a qualitative nature and did
 not focus on 
numerical compliance with the fiscal
 rules. This was due to the activation of the 
general escape clause
58 which 
allow
s Member States to 
deviat
e from 
the adjustment 
requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact in certain specific, defined situations, 
such as a severe economic downturn for the euro area or the Union as a whole. 
Instead t
he Commission™s assessment was based o
n the fiscal 
country
-specific 
recommendations 
adopted by the Council on 20 July
 2020 as well as its guidance 
issued in September in the form of 
letters 
sent 
to all Member States indicating that 
the 
general escape clause
 would 
remain active 
also 
in 2021
 to ensure the needed support 
from fiscal policies. The 
Commission 
also
 clarified 
in its assessment 
that 
when economic conditions allow, Member States should pursue fiscal policies aimed at 
achieving prudent medium
-term fiscal positions
 and ensuring debt s
ustainability, while 
enhancing investment
. 
In order to reconcile the need 
to provide macroeconomic 
stabilisation while ensuring 
medium
-term fiscal sustainability, 
the Commission stated 
that 
support measures should be 
targeted and 
temporary
, as permanent me
asures 
which are not financed by compensatory measures may affect fiscal sustainability in 
the medium term
. The draft budgetary plans point to a shift in the composition of measures from 
emergency to recovery measures in 2021, but do not yet fully reflect 
support 
from the Next Generation EU (NGEU).
 According to the European Commission, 
Member States have taken sizeable fiscal measures in response to the pandemic 
amounting to 
4.2% of GDP 
in 2020 and 2.4% of GDP in 2021
. 
The composition of 
fiscal p
ackages in 
2020 largely consist
ed of 
emergency 
measures aimed at alleviating 
the immediate effects of the crisis
, namely to 
address
 the public health situation
 and limit economic scarring. According to the Commission™s assessment, such emergency 
measures amounted to approximately 80% of 2020 fiscal packages at the aggregate 
euro area level. 
From 2021 onwards, the measures related to the provision of 
emergency support
 are projected to 
expire
 gradually and there is a shift towards 
measures supporting the recovery. 
The European Commission™s assessment of the 
draft budgetary plans points to recovery measures, such as 
indirect tax cuts 
and increased government investment
, 
accounting for over 60% of the fiscal measures in 
2021. 
The 
NGEU
, and in particular its 
central pillar the 
Recovery and 
Resilience 
Facility
, 
is expected to
 start 
being
 implemented 
in 2021. However,
 given the state of 
                                                                    58  The clause was introduced as part of the 
ﬁSix-Pack
ﬂ reform of the Stability and Growth Pact in 2011.
 The 
clause can be activated in
 the case of an unusual event outside the control of the Member State 
concerned, which has a major impact on the financial position of the general government or in periods of 
severe economic downturn for the euro area or the Union as a whole
. When activated
 it allows Member 
States to temporarily 
depart from the 
fiscal 
adjustment 
requirements under both the preventive and 
corrective arms of the Pact provided this does not 
endanger fiscal su
stainability in the medium term.

indicated that 
the draft budgetary plans
 for 2021 
are 
overall in line with the fiscal policy recommendation adopted by the Council
, 
but highlighted risks where measures are planned to be permanent
. It assessed 
that in the majority of the euro area countries the measures fo

are (mostly) 
temporary
 with only the plans
 of France, Italy, Lithuania
59 and Slovakia 
pointing to 
measures that do not appear to be
 temporary or matched by offsetting measures
. 
For 
Belgium, 
Greece, Spain, 
France, Italy 
and Portugal, the European Comm
ission 
highlighted that ﬁgiven the level of their government debt and high sustainability 
challenges in the medium term – it is important to ensure that, when taking supporting 
budgetary measures, fiscal sustainability in the medium term is preservedﬂ.
 The
 large 
prevailing uncertainty makes it difficult to assess measures, all the more so as 
temporary and more structural measures cannot always be distinguished, given that 
countries are adopting measures in response to the evolution of crisis waves
. The Comm
ission™s assessment has to be seen in light of 
the 
significant and 
divergent impact that 
the severity of the 
COVID
-19 shock and the fiscal 
support 
measures are having on public finances
, but also the prevailing large 
uncertainty.
 On average around 30% of t
he budgetary deterioration projected in 2020 
is expected to be reversed in 2021 with deficit ratios remaining above the 3% of GDP 
threshold in 
all
 euro area countries
 except Luxembourg and Cyprus (see Chart A)
. 
Spain, France, 
Italy and 
Slovakia are project
ed to have the highest deficits 
of more 
than 7.5% of GDP 
in 2021. Based on a no
-policy
-change assumption, deficits would 
remain above the 3% threshold in thirteen euro area Member States in 2022.
 Moreover, many c
ountries that entered the crisis with 
high 
debt ratios of around 100% 
and above are projected to 
be hit strongest by the COVID
-19 shock in terms of 
increasing indebtedness (see

maintain debt ratios below the Maastricht 60% of GDP reference valu
e in 2022, 
i.e. 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania

 and Malta.

 1 The E
uropean exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) as a 
preparatory phase on the path towards euro adoption 
Œ the cases of Bulgaria and Croatia
 Prepared by Ettore Dorrucci, Michael Fidora, Christine Gartner and Tina 
Zumer
 Following the completion of a roadmap agreed
 over the past few years among all 
relevant EU stakeholders, the Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna were included in 
the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) on 10 July 2020. Their inclusion 
marks a milestone towards future enlargement of the euro ar
ea, given the important 
role that ERM II plays as a preparatory phase for euro adoption. Participation
 in ERM II 
may lead to a regime shift in the country concerned, i.e. it may alter the incentives of 
international and local investors and of the national 
authorities.
 We provide evidence that a regime shift indeed occurred in the central and eastern 
European countries (CEECs) 
that
 joined the mechanism in 2004 and 2005. If 
supported by sound economic policies, this shift may have positive consequences, 
such 
as accelerating the convergence process. Conversely, the implementation of 
ill-advised policy measures may contribute to a build
-up of economic imbalances. The 
article also looks at ERM II from a
 historical
 perspective, reviews its main features and 
proced
ures and explains the new roadmap towards participation in ERM II 
Œ and, 
simultaneously, European banking union 
Œ that was established and successfully 
implemented for Bulgaria and Croatia
. The main conclusion of the article is that in order to fully reap 
the benefits of monetary 
integration and ensure their 
own 
smooth participation in the mechanism, countries 
need sound policies, governance and institutions which allow them to address risks 
with adequate macroeconomic, macroprudential, supervisory and stru
ctural 
measures.
 1 Introduction
 Two EU Member States, Bulgaria and Croatia, joined ERM II on 10 July 2020.
 The 
process 
began in 2017 
along a roadmap
 that 
reflect
ed lessons learned from 
other 
countries™ experiences
, the advent of 
European 
banking union a
nd a careful 
assessment of country

  85 and the Governor of

.61 These stakeholders
 took their 
decisions following a common procedure involving
 the European Commission and 
consultation 
of the Economic and Financial Committee in its euro area format
, known 
as the
 Eurogroup 
Working 
Group (EWG)
. The inclusion of the Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna in ERM II
 is 
a milestone 
towards
 further enlargement of the euro area.
 Bulgaria
 and Croatia are expected 
to adopt 
the euro once the
y have 
fulfilled
 the necessary requirements
 (the
 ﬁMaastrichtﬂ 
convergence criteria
) as assessed in the 
Convergence Reports of the European 
Commission
 and the ECB.
62 For Bulgaria and Croatia, ERM II will therefore serve not only as an exchange 
rate arrangement, but also as a preparatory phase for euro ado
ption.
 ERM II has 
two main purposes. The first is to 
act as an arrangement for managing exchange rates 
between the participating currencies, thus also contributing to the smoo
th functioning 
of the 
single 
European 
market
 by fostering exchange rate stability
. The second is to 
assist the convergence assessment 
provided for in
 the Treaty 
on the Functioning of 
the European Union (TFEU) with regard to the adoption of
 the euro 
by non
-euro area 
EU Member States,
 with the exception of Denmark, which has a special st
atus.
63 In 
this way, ERM II offers 
a testing ground 
befor
e the 
adoption of the 
euro
, as the 
economies of the participating Member States operate under a regime of stable 
exchange rates vis
-à-vis the
 euro
 (market test) and
 are expected to further strengthen 
their macroeconomic, macroprudential, supervisory and structural policies (policy 
test), 
with the support of ever
-evolving 
economic
 governance
 from the European 
Union
. This article
 looks at the participation of the Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna
 in ERM II, focusing on the mechanism™s role as a bridge from domestic 
currencies towards the euro.
 Specifically, Section 2 
briefly reviews the history, main 
features and procedures of ERM II. 
Section 3
 argues on the basis of quantitative 
evidence that 
ERM
 II may lead to
 a regime shift
 in participating countries on the path to 
euro adoption
. 
Section 4
 explains the roadmap towards ERM II participation that 
was
 established and 
implemented 
for
 Bulgaria and Croatia. 
Finally, Section 5
 concludes by 
highlighting 
the way ahead and 
the key 
challenges 
faced by Bulgaria and Croatia on 
the path towards euro adoption.
                                                                     61  Until 10 July 2020
 Denmark was 
the only non
-euro area EU Member State participating in the 
mechanism
. Since 
then 
the ERM II parties 
have 
also include
d Bulgaria and Croatia.
 62  Article 140 and Proto
col 13 TFEU state that euro adoption by a given Member State is subject to the 
fulfilment of several economic and legal (Maastricht) convergence criteria. In their biennial Convergence 
Reports, the ECB and the European Commission examine whether (i) the co
untries concerned have 
achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, (ii) the national legislations are 
compatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the ECB, and 
(iii) the statutory requirements ar
e fulfilled for the relevant national central banks to become an integral 
part of the Eurosystem.
 63  With regard to exchange rate stability, the ECB and the European Commission examine whether the 
country has participated in ERM II for a period of at least
 two years without severe tensions being 
observed in the normal fluctuation margins of the exchange rate mechanism. In particular, this means 
that the country should not devalue the bilateral central rate against the euro on its own initiative during 
this 
period. Protocol 16 TFEU grants an exemption to Denmark from participation in Stage Three of EMU. 
Denmark is, therefore, the only non
-euro area EU Member State to participate in ERM II without pursuing 
the objective of euro adoption.

  86 2 The history, main features and procedures of ERM II
 2.1
 History
 With the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, ERM II replaced the original 
exchan
ge rate mechanism, which was one of the components of the 
European 
Monetary System (EMS)
 in place since 13 March 1979.
64 The original ERM, a core 
element of the EMS, 
was 
aimed at reducing exchange rate variability and foster
ing
 monetary stability
 among the 
currencies of an initial 
eight 
Member States. With the 
introduction of the euro, the
 Danish 
krone and the 
Greek 
drachma 
were 
included in 
the 
new mechanism,
 ERM II. After 
Greece 
adopted 
the euro 
in 2001, 
Denmark 
was
 the 
only non
-euro area EU Member State pa
rticipating in the mechanism
 until 2004 (see 
Chart 1).
                                                                     64  More generally, on 
1 January 1999 EMS was replaced by Stage Three of EMU.

Monetary System
  Source: ECB.
 Notes: 
 1) The ERM, which was one element of the European Monetary System, 
became 
operational
 on 13 March 1979 and ended with the start 
of 
Stage 
Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) on 1 January 1999. On the same day the ERM was succeeded by ERM II.
 2) Belgium and Luxembourg were in a monetary association until the adoption of the
 euro in 1999.
 3) The standard fluctuation band around the central rates in the ERM was ± 2.25%, except for the Italian lira, the Spanish pe
seta, the 
Portuguese 
escudo and the 
UK p
ound sterling, for which it was ± 6%. From 8 January 1990 until 16 September
 1992 the Italian lira 
(previously
 in the wide band of the ERM) was in the narrow band.
 4) In August 1993 the ERM fluctuation band w
as widened temporarily to ± 15% for all ERM participants.
 5) In September 1992 the participation of the Italian lira and the
 UK pound sterling in the ERM was suspended. The 
Italian 
lira resumed 
full participation in the ERM in November 1996.
 6) Greece participated in ERM II in 
the period 
1999-2000 with the new standard ±15% fluctuation band. Denmark kept the ± 2.25% 
fluctuation
 band within both the ERM and ERM II. While the nominal band was standard, nearly all subsequent ERM II members 
unilaterally committed to a narrower actual fluctuation band upon joining ERM II. These commitments do not involve any obliga
tions on 
the 
part o
f the 
other ERM II parties.
 7) The Czech Republic introduced a
 one
-sided
 exchange rate floor towards the euro from November 2013 to April 2017.
 8) The United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020.
 On 1 May 2004 ten new Member States joined the Eu
ropean Union and their 
national central banks (NCBs) became part of the ERM II Central Bank 
Agreement
. On 28 June 2004, soon after EU enlargement, t
he Estonian kroon, 
the 
Lithuanian litas and 
the 
Slovenian tolar were 
added to
 ERM II
. On 2 May 2005
 the 
Cypr
us pound, the Latvian lats and the Maltese lira
 joined the mechanism, followed by 
the Slovak koruna
 on 28 November 2005
. 
Since then, all these countries have 
adopted the euro after 
ﬁfulfilling their obligations regarding the achievement of 
economic and mon
etary union
ﬂ (Article 140 of the TFEU), which included receiving 
positive convergence assessments from the ECB and the European Commission (see 
Chart 1).

 Main features
 ERM II 
was
 established by
 the European Council Resolution of 16 June 1997
65, which stipulated that ﬁ
The euro will be the centre of the new mechanism
.ﬂ The 
main features 
of ERM II 
are (i) a central rate against the euro
, (ii) a fluctuation band 
with a standard width of ±15
% around the central rate
, (iii) interventions at the margin
s of the agreed fluctuation band
, and (iv) the availability of very short
-term financing 
from 
the 
participating central banks. Participating 
NCBs may unilaterally commit 
themselves to tighter fluctuation bands 
(including currency board regimes) 
than those 
provided for by ERM II, without 
imposing any additional obligations on the 
other
 participating 
NCB
s or the ECB
.66 Interventions at the margins of the fluctuation bands 
are in principle automatic and unlimited
, although the ECB and the participating NCBs 
can
 suspend them at any time if they conflict with the primary objective of maintaining 
price stability.
 During ERM II participation, realignments of the central rate or 
adjustment
s to the width of the fluctuation band may occur, for example if equilibrium 
exchange rates 
change
 over time. Such developments may 
take place
 not only 
during 
a process of real convergence
, but also in the case of significant changes in external 
competitiveness or in the presence of inconsistent economic policies.
 2.3
 Main procedures
 While 
ERM II is referred to in the Treaty as an integral part of the Maastricht 
exchange rate 
convergence 
criteri
a, 
the ERM II 
procedures
 and agreements 
are 
not based on the Treaty
, since 
they are intergovernmental in nature.
 According to 
Article
 2.3 of the European Council Resolution
 of 1997
, the decisions regarding 
participation in ERM II 
Œ in particular, whether the currency of a country can be 
included in the mechanism with a certain 
central rate and fluctuation band
 Œ are 
taken 
by mutual agre
ement of the 
finance 
ministers of euro area 
countries
, the ECB and the 
finance 
ministers and central bank governors of the non
-euro area Member States 
participating in ERM II
 at any given time
. The decisions 
are taken at the end of a 
process involving
 cons
ultation of 
the EWG. T
he European Commission is 
also 
involved in th
is process; it 
participat
es in the relevant meetings
, can be mandated 
particular tasks
 and is kept 
informed
 by the ERM II parties
. As participation in ERM II is 
a precondition for the event
ual introduction of the euro, all EU Member States with a 
derogation from the obligation to adopt the euro
, i.e. all non
-euro area Member States 
except Denmark,
 are expected to join the mechanism at some stage.
 In the interest
s of all 
stakeholders
, decisio
ns regarding participation in ERM II 
are to be 
mutually agreed
 on the basis of a sound and thorough economic 
assessment
 conducted by the relevant parties
, and in consultation with the 
European Commission,
 through a candid, in
-depth exchange of views.
 The requirement 
for 
mutual agreement on ERM II participation 
means that there must be a
 consensus that the Member State concerned is pursuing 
effective 
stability
-oriented 
                                                                    65  Resolution of the European Council on the establishment of an exchange
-rate mechanism in the thir
d stage of economic and monetary union
, Amsterdam, 16 June 1997
 (OJ C 236, 2.8.1997, p.5).
 66  While narrower bands are as a rule adopted on a unilateral basis, i.e. without 
imposing any additional 
obligations on the remaining participating NCBs or the ECB,
 they can be multilaterally agreed in the case 
of economies at a sufficiently advanced stage of economic convergence
, as was the case with Denmark

 This is reflected in t

by the ECB™s Governing Council in 20

ﬂ (
Article 140 of the TFEU) 
is the most important 
precondition for 
the 
successful 
adoption of 
the euro. 
To thi
s end, s
ound policies and an 
adequate level of institutional quality are
 of the essence. They are therefore given due 
consideration
 when assessing the readiness of a 
non-euro area EU Member State to 
participate in ERM II.
 This is all the more important as 
participation in
 ERM II 
may 
affect the 
expectations and 
economic incentives of international and local investors, as 
well as those of 
the local
 policy 
authorities
, in 
a regime shift
 that 
may
 in turn 
trigger various positive or negative dynamics
. Progress in the process of 
monetary integration, as well as 
the 
prospect
 of 
adopting 
the euro
, may improve

. This
 may 
result in 
an acceleration 
of 
gross
 international
 financial
 inflows
 and, in turn
, stronger 
domestic 
credit 
growth
 coupled with a significant improvement in financing conditions
. While this may fuel a sustainable catching
-up process, it 
may 
also provide the wrong 
sort of
 incentives
 if coupled with a weak institutional 
and business environment
, 
potentially 
leading to 
misallocation of capital, 
postponement of necessary reforms and 
deterioration in the country™s adjustment capacity
, for example. The ensuing build
-up of imbalances might eventually exacerbate a possible internation
al financial flow 
reversal.

Œ the cases of Bulgaria and Croatia
  90 which have joined ERM II in the past.
 The analysis focuses 
on the CEECs
 that 
joined ERM II in 2004 and 2005 and subsequently adopted the euro
: Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Slovenia
 and Slovakia
. Section 3.2 compares their experiences with those 
of the EU Member States in the same region which have not yet participated in ERM
 II (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania) or which joined the mechanism 
only very recently (Bulgaria and Croatia). Section 3.3 discusses some policy 
implications arising from this analysis.
 3.2
 Evidence
 Following the accession of the above CEECs 
to the European Union, countries 
that 
participated in ERM II 
experienced
 a more pronounced international 
financial flow
 cycle 
tha
n those which 
did not
 participate.
 Gross financial inflows 
as a share of GDP accelerated ahead of EU accession, which for some 
countries also 
coincided with the start of their participation in ERM II.
70 However, countries that 
joined ERM II experienced a much stronger surge (see Charts 2 and 3). Gross 
financial inflows in ERM II countries peaked about three years after they joined 
ERM II, 
at an average of around 30% of GDP (see Chart 2). Conversely, gross financial inflows 
were more stable in the non
-ERM II countries, remaining at between 5% and 10% of 
GDP following EU accession (see Chart 3). 
With the 
onset
 of the 
global
 financial 
crisis
 in 2007
-08, 
which materialised
 in most 
of the observed 
countries about three
 to
 four 
years after EU accession, ERM II 
participants 
experienced a sharper 
financial flow 
reversal (see Charts 2 and 3).
71 Supporting the quantitative evidence, internal 
econometric analysis on a sample of
 emerging market and (former) transition 
economies 
shows that 
the degree of flexibility of the exchange rate regime does not 
affect
 financial
 inflows to these countries, whereas ERM II participation is found to 
increase the
 magnitude of gross 
financial
 inflows
. At the same time, the results 
suggest 
that EU accession is not relevant 
in explaining 
the financial
 inflows 
recorded.
72                                                                     70  As the countries under consideration joined both the European Union and ERM II in 2004
-05 (except for 
Bulgar
ia, Romania and Croatia), these developments also reflected business cycle synchronisation to 
some extent.
 71  Countries participating in ERM II 
also 
experienced larger 
international financial
 inflows
 than the other 
CEECs in net terms.
 72  The insignificance
 of EU accession for international financial inflows holds true if the ERM II participation 
dummy is dropped from the specification.

 The

the CEECs 
participating in 
ERM II and 
other CEECs were driven
 largely by 
bank lending 
and, to a lesser extent, by inward foreign direct investment (FDI).
 The largest 
share of financial flows to ERM II CEECs took the form of ﬁother investmentﬂ, 
consisting mainly of 
bank lending
 to firms and households and f
lows within banking 
groups

 foreign (mostly EU

  92 Conversely
, the composition of 
international financial
 flows to 
non-ERM II CEECs 
was 
much more evenl
y distributed between 
FDI and other investment (see Charts 2 and 3).
 After joining the mechanism, ERM II participants also 
experienced a 
stronger
 expansion 
in 
domestic credit and lower real interest rates
 tha
n CEECs 
that did 
not join ERM II after 
their acc
ession to the EU.
 Large
 international financial
 inflows, 
particularly in the form of bank credit
 and other interbank flows
, can exacerbate the 
domestic credit cycle
, for example by supporting funding for banks.
73 Credit to the 
private sector as a share of G
DP nearly doubled in ERM II countries in the five years 
after they joined the mechanism, while in the other CEECs the increase in credit stock 
was more gradual (see Chart 4). At the same time, ERM II countries experienced 
negative average short
-term real i
nterest rates in the three to four
-year period after 
joining ERM II. In addition, the drop in long
-term real interest rates was much stronger 
in ERM II countries than in non
-ERM II countries (see Chart 5).
 While
 financially 
less
-developed economies 
usually
 have 
lower
 domestic savings and therefore need 
financing from abroad in order to support economic growth and the overall catching
-up process, t
his may pose a challenge for certain countries joining ERM II
, as large 
international financial inflows are like
ly to fuel
 credit boom
s and 
busts
.74 Moreover, 
credit booms can turn out 
to be 
more severe and difficult to contain in countries with 
fixed exchange rates
, as 
the 
rising inflation typically associated with strong domestic 
demand lowers real interest rates further and 
this 
in turn 
triggers additional
 credit 
demand
.                                                                     73  See, for example, Lane, P.R. and McQuade, P., ﬁ

 Policy implications
 Althoug
h the period following EU accession in 2004
-05 fell within the 
environment of ﬁGreat Moderationﬂ
75, which is very different from the 
conditions prevailing today, the empirical
 findings 
discussed in the previous 
subsection nevertheless carry some general 
pol
icy implications
 that may be of 
relevance for Bulgaria and Croatia, as well as for other EU Member States that 
seek ERM II participation
 in the future.
 ERM II participants
 may benefit from 
increased availability of capital, 
but 
they may also face an increa
sed risk of 
a build
-up of macroeconomic imbalances
. C
ountries with large 
international financial
 inflows are 
indeed 
more likely to experience credit booms and
 busts as foreign 
financial
 inflows 
increase the available funds of the banking system, 
of 
which 
a significant share 
is often 
foreign
-owned
 in central and eastern Europe
. Historical experience suggests that factors such as 
resilient economic 
structures
76 and
 the quality of institutions and governance reduce the risk of 
economic 
imbalances
 and enhance t
he capacity
 of a country 
to cope with 
shock
s. While
 the 
economic literature
 on this topic 
has mainly focused on th
e phase 
following
 euro adoption,
77 the evidence discussed in the previous sub
section 
suggests that similar dynamics might also materialise 
duri
ng the 
run
-up to euro 
adoption
. Resilien
t economic structures
 create the preconditions for allocating capital to 
productive firms, thus supporting the catching
-up process rather than the 
formation of bubbles
. This
 also 
allows
 policymakers to resist pressur
es of vested 
interests against the implementation of necessary reforms, build
 up fiscal buffers 
during upturn
s and implement
 other countercyclical measures, including on the 
macroprudential side. 
Developments such as a surge in the most volatile components
 of 
international financial
 flows may 
provide
 the wrong s
ort
 of incentives in a weak 
institutional context, thus leading to the postponement of reforms and deterioration in 
the 
country™s 
adjustment capacity.
 This is not to deny that 
developing 
economies ne
ed to attract capital. 
However,
 if institutions are weak, such 
financial
 inflows are more 
likely to eventually become a 
disadvantage more
 than a benefit.
 The smooth participation of a given currency in ERM II therefore requires the 
proper framework 
conditions to be in place at the national level.

 4 The Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna in 
ERM II
 In the 
summer
s of 
2018 and 2019 
respectively,
 following discussions with the 
ERM II parties
, the 
Bulgarian and Croatian 
authorities
 made a number of policy 
commitments in areas of high relevance for a smoot
h transition 
process
 and
 subsequent
 participation in ERM II
. After
 fulfilment
 of th
ese
 so-called prior policy 
commitments, as well as 
the announcement of post
-entry policy commitments 
to be
 completed after joining ERM II
, the two countries 
enter
ed ERM II a
nd European 
banking union
 simultaneously
 on 10 July 2020. 
This section 
explains the rationale for
 ERM II 
participation 
and the roadmap
 towards 
it that was implemented for these two 
EU Member States.
 When Bulgaria and Croatia 
first 
expressed 
their
 interest 
in
 join
ing
 the 
mechanism, ERM II parties took account of three fundamental considerations
. First, it w
ould be
 the first time a country 
had
 join
ed ERM II 
since
 the financial 
crisis, from which important lessons had been learned
. As a result,
 the European 
institutional framework had been substantially overhauled 
over the previous decade 
and it was crucial not to
 overlook
 the lessons learned
 in 
future 
ERM II decisions. 
The 
resilience of economic structures
, financial stability and the quality of institutions a
nd governance had 
moved
 to the forefront
 of discussions
, given their 
importa
nce for the 
longer
-term sustainability of euro adoption. In particular, the experience
s of former 
ERM II participants had confirmed that these features 
needed to be in place 
to ens
ure
 smooth 
participation in the mechanism.
 Second, it w
ould
 also 
be 
the first time a Member State 
had
 join
ed ERM II since 
the start 
of 
European
 banking union
. In 
banking union
, 
the Single Supervisory 
Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism 
have
 direct powers over
 the 
banking system of the Member State concerned.
 Each Member State is required to 
enter banking union at the latest by the time it introduces the euro. Given that ERM II is 
a preparatory phase for euro adoption, joining ERM II today also means preparing for 
banking union. 
To this 
end, it was considered 
advisable for countries aiming to adopt 
the euro to enter into 
close
 cooperation with the ECB 
(see Box 1) at the same time as 
joining 
ERM II
.78 Third, there was also a need to take account of country
-specific considerations.
 While both Bulgaria and Croatia 
had made significant progress in addressing 
macroeconomic imbalances and both countries had a track record 
of adjust
ing
 to 
                                                                    78  At the same time
, entering into close 
supervisory 
cooperation 
without
 joinin
g ERM
 II is also a possible 
course of action for EU 
Member 
States that are currently outside 
the euro area
, i.e. the two processes do 
not 
necessarily 
need to be synchroni
sed.

 Œ Articles
 The
 European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) as a preparatory phase on the path 
towards euro adoption 
Œ the cases of Bulgaria and Croatia
  96 adverse shocks
 under their 
own 
exchange rate regimes, there were concerns about 
their smooth participation in ERM II
, owing to
 a numb
er of 
remaining vulnerabilities.
 In this context, the question arose 
as to 
how the aforementioned 
considerations could best 
be 
accommodated within the existing institutional 
and legal framework
. EU 
Member States 
must
 be treated equally at any given stage 
of EMU
, which
 implies that no preconditions or new rules can be imposed before a 
Member State applies for ERM II participation. Any Member State is, therefore, free to 
request the inclusion of its currency in 
ERM II at any time and make its policy 
commitmen
ts, as other Member States 
have done
 in the past. At the same time and in 
line with the 
procedure
 recalled 
in 
Section 2.3
, ERM II parties 
may decide not to agree 
to that Member State™s 
ERM II 
participation
 in 
the event
 that 
the policy commitments 
and relat
ed actions taken by 
its
 national authorities do not sufficiently address the 
identified 
developments, concerns and risks. This approach is fully consistent with the 
ERM II framework.
 During the informal phase of the
 roadmap towards ERM II participation, 
a dialogue was held between 
the 
ERM II parties and the Bulgarian and Croatian 
authorities on the risks that had been identified and how they could be 
mitigated
. This 
dialogue clarified
 the
 policy commitments 
that 
the Bulgarian and 
Croatian authorities would have 
to m
ake
 and fulfil
 when
 moving forward with the 
roadmap
. Once this phase was completed, the last step in the roadmap was marked 
by the 
formal 
requests for the inclusion of the Bulgarian lev and the Croatian
 kuna in 
ERM II
, which were sent the day before the decision was taken.
 Some policy commitments 
were
 completed by the time 
Bulgaria and Croatia 
formally 
enter
ed ERM II (ﬁprior commitmentsﬂ)
 and, i
n line with past practices, 
other commitments have 
to be 
com
pleted after joining ERM II
 (ﬁpost
-entry 
commitmentsﬂ
), with the aim of achieving a high degree of sustainable 
economic convergence by the time of euro adoption
. Both prior and post
-entry 
commitments needed to be reasonable, proportional and motivated. The
y also had to 
be specific, realistic and verifiable in nature. Finally, it was agreed that they 
had to
 be implemented, monitored and verified in a relatively short 
period
 of time.
 In the meantime
, adequate monitoring 
was
 established by the ECB and the 
Euro
pean 
Commission within their respective remits in order to verify 
compliance with both 
prior and post
-entry
 commitments
. In particular, the ECB 
focused on commitments related to the banking sector
, including 
both 
banking 
supervision and macroprudential iss
ues. Following a mandate 
issued 
by 
the 
ERM II 
parties, the Commission focused on commitments 
concerning
 structural policies. In 
order to forestall overlap with other procedures, it was also 
noted 
that fiscal policies 
are governed by 
the Stability and Growt
h Pact, and that the
 judicial
 reforms
 and the 
fight against corruption and organised crime in Bulgaria were monitored by the 
Commission under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM).
 Prior commitments were 
made
 by Bulgaria in 
the 
summer 
of 
2018 an
d by 
Croatia in 
the 
summer 
of 
2019, and completed 
by both countries 
before 
they 
join
ed ERM II on 10 July 2020.
 Three of these commitments were in 
the same 
policy 
areas 
for 
both 
Bulgaria and Croatia:

  Completion of ERM II prior policy commitments related to banking supervision and the 
macroprudential toolkit
 Prepared by Maximilian Fandl, Jaime Serra Goya and Kalina Paula 
Tylko
-Tylczynska
 The
 European Central Bank was mandated by the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) parties to 
monitor the implem
entation of the two prior commitments related to banking supervision and financial 
stability, which the Bulgarian and Croatian auth
orities had to complete by the time 
they joined
 ERM II. 
The 
two commitments were
: (i) to establish close cooperation between ECB Banking Supervision and 
the national competent authority (NCA) under the legal framework of the S
ingle 
Supervisory 
Mechanism (S
SM);
 and (ii) to strengthen the macroprudential toolkit by establishing a clear legal 
basis 
on which 
to adopt macroprudential borrower
-based measures, such as imposing limits on the 
debt service burden of borrowers relative to their income.
 Bulgaria and Cr
oatia submitted requests 
to
 establish close cooperation between the
ir NCAs
 and the 
ECB
 in July 2018 and May 2019 respectively. Based on
 these requests, the ECB assessed whether 
the conditions 
for 
establish
ing
 close cooperation 
had been
 met. 
In accordance 
with
 the legal 
framework, the assessment consist
ed of two main parts: 
(i) a
 legal assessment of the relevant 
national law adopted by the requesting Member State
, and 
(ii) a
 comprehensive assessment of credit 
institutions established in the 
Member 
State. To
 properly verify whether all conditions ha
d been met, 
the ECB developed a standard assessment framework based on Article 7 of the SSM Regulation
79 and the procedural aspects specified in Decision ECB/2014/5 on close cooperation
80. With regard to the legal as
sessment, Bulgaria adopted relevant legislation in December 2018, putting 
in place 
a 
would adopt any measure
s required by the ECB
 in relation to credit institutions.
 The ECB as
sessed

new 
legislation, including whether the powers available to 
the BNB
 would be at least equivalent to 
those of ECB

 amending the Law on credit institutions
81 and the 
Law on 
the Bulgarian National

The new law 
amended
 the sanctioning powers of 
the BNB
 and extended the list of breaches which may be subject to sanctions.
 Similarly, the Croatian authorities amended the 
Credit Institutions
 Act
83 and the 
Act
 on the Croatian 
National Bank
84 in order to create 
a legal basis for close cooperation with the ECB. The
 first 
amendments were adopted by the Croatian Parliament in July 2019 and entered into force in August 
2019. Additi
onal amendments were adopted in April 2020 and entered into force in the same month. 
The ECB assessed the national legal framework as compliant with the relevant conditions 
for establish
ing
 close cooperation. 
The amendments
 ensured that once close cooperation started, the 
ECB had all 
the 
powers 
necessary 
to carry out its supervisory tasks vis
-à-vis Croatian banks.
 The comprehensive assessment results for Bulgarian banks were published on 26 July 2019 and 
indicated capital sh
ortfalls for two out of the six participating banks.
85 The two
 banks implemented 
their respective capital plans before close cooperation
 was established
. With this final step, all 
supervisory and legislative prerequisites were fulfilled. On 10 July 2020 the
 ECB announced that 
its
 Governing Council had adopted a 
Decision establish
ing
 close cooperation wi
th the BNB
86. The comprehensive assessment results for Croatian banks were published on 5 June 2020 and did 
not indicate any capital shortfalls for the five se
lected Croatian banks. On 10 July 2020 the ECB 
announced that 
its
 Governing Council had adopted a Decision establishing close cooperation with 
Hrvatska narodna banka
 (HNB
)87 following the 
latter™s 
fulfilment of all supervisory and legislative 
prerequisites.
 When Bulgaria and Croatia expressed
 the
ir intent to join ERM II, the
ir macroprudential framework did 
not include a legal basis for borrower
-based measures. Instead, the framework mainly relied on 
capital instruments based on the Capital Requirements Direc
tive
88 and the Capital Requirements 
Regulation
89, such as the countercyclical capital buffer. Although both HNB and 
the BNB
 had broad 
powers to issue recommendations on new lending practices, these were not as legally binding and 
enforceable as borrower
-base
d measures.
 Against this background, both the Bulgarian and the Croatian authorities 
made 
commit
ments
 to 
broaden the
ir macroprudential toolkit by providing the legal basis for borrower
-based measures. This

tory phase on the path 
towards euro adoption 
Œ the cases of Bulgaria and Croatia
  99 was completed through the adoption of the relevant
 legislation in December 2018 and April 2020 
respectively.
 After the completion of 
their 
prior commitments, Bulgaria and Croatia joined ERM II and banking 
union. From 1 October 2020 the ECB started directly supervising 
significant 
Bulgarian and Croatian 
institutions, while the Single Resolution Board became the resolution authority for these and all 
cross
-border groups. Credit institutions falling under close cooperation are subject to the same 
supervisory standards and procedures as thei
r equivalents in th
e euro area.
 A key difference between Member States that have adopted the euro and 
those 
under close 
cooperation is that ECB legal acts, including decisions on banks, do not have direct effect in the 
Member State in close cooperation. This 
mean
s that the E
CB does not adopt decisions addressed to 
banks in these Member States, but rather 
issue
s instructions to the respective NCA, which will in turn 
adopt the required administrative measures
 at the national level
. The establishment of close cooperation with 
th
e BNB
 and HNB marks an important milestone in the 
development of banking union. It is the first time that banking union has been enlarged with EU 
Member States 
outside 
the euro area.

by regular technical exchanges between the Commission and the Bulgarian and Croa

The European Commission provided regular progress updates to the ERM II parties. At the same 
time, the ECB was reporting on the implementation of policy measures related to banking supervision

 At the 
time of its inclusion in

(Bulgaria

, enshrined in the Law on

Bank, to exchange 
domestic currency at the rate of 1
,000 old Bulgarian lev
s per Deutsche Mark. Following a (purely 
nominal) redenomination of the Bulgarian lev in June 1999, the fixed ex
change rate was realigned to 
1 new Bulgarian lev per Deutsche Mark. When the Deutsche Mark lost its status

 In line with its currency board regime, 
BNB
 frequently exchanges Bulgarian lev
s for euro in operations 
with domestic banks, while Hrvatska narodna banka (HNB) only rarely intervenes in foreign exchange 
mark
ets. As
 stipulated by the Law on 
BNB
, the monetary liabilities of 
BNB
 are fully covered by its 
foreign reserves and 
BNB
 is obliged to exchange monetary liabilities and euro at the official exchange
 rate
. Thus, the issuance of 
Bulgarian levs
 is not discreti
onary, but directly linked to the availability of 
international reserves. As a result, 
BNB 
does not need to undertake traditional foreign exchange 
interventions in order to maintain the exchange rate peg
. Instead,
 it issues or absorbs national 
currency sol
ely against reserve currency in transactions with the banking sector, referred to as ﬁtype II 
interventionsﬂ, such that the national currency supply automatically equates 
to 
the demand. In the 
case of the Croatian kuna, interventions have historically been
 carried out both 
to support and
 to 
weaken 
the currency
, although more recently, until the 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) shock, HNB has 
mostly intervened in order to counter appreciation pressures.
 As a result of their credible commitments to maintaining exchange
 rate stability, both 
national central 
banks have accumulated comfortable buffers of foreign exchange reserves. Since
 the global financial 
crisis
 of 2007
-08, 
BNB
 and HNB have significantly expanded their holdings of foreign exchange 
reserves. In 2019

 Equally
, both countries 
have 
experienced significant improvements in their 
external balance
s since 
the global financial crisis
, turning their
 current account balances from double

surplus
es.
 Their net international investment positions

for both countrie
s to 
-50% for
 Croatia and 
-30% for
 Bulgaria, 
making the latter
 one of
 the 
least vulnerable central and eastern European countries.
 This rebalancing was also paired with significant adjustment of relative costs and prices, such that 
from a normative perspec
tive the Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna were assessed to be in line with 
fundamentals. The assessment of both countries™ external balance
s when they joined
 ERM II 
suggested
 that 
their
 current account balances were relatively close to their cyclically
 adjusted level
, and if anything somewhat above their medium
-term current account benchmarks, thus 
indicating
 that the currencies
 were not overvalued
. At the same time, both countries™ relative price levels were close 
to what their relative income levels wo
uld 
suggest 
based on a comparative econometric analysis. In 
2019 Bulgaria™s price level stood at 52
% compared with
 the euro area, while its real per capita GDP 
was 49
% of 
that of the
 euro area
. Croatia™s price level 
was
 65% compared with
 the euro area, whi
le its 
real per capita GDP was 60
% of 
that of the euro area.
 In the absence of any significant real exchange rate misalignment, the ERM II parties decided to set 
the central rates of the Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna at 
the level of 
their prevailing 
market 
rate
s. In the case of the Bulgarian lev
, this was equal to
 its fixed exchange rate under the currency 
board arrangement.
 Thus, the Bulgarian lev was included with its central rate set as its fixed 
exchange rate of 1.95583 levs per euro. The Croatian
 kuna was included with its central rate set to 
7.53450 kuna per euro, corresponding to the level of the reference exchange rate (as published by 
the ECB 
based on a daily con
sul
tation between 
European 
central banks
) ahead of its inclusion.
 Both countries were included in ERM II with a standard fluctuation margin 
of ±15
%. 
At the same time
, it was accepted that Bulgaria 
would join 
with its existing currency board arrangement in place as a 
unilateral commitment 
imposing
 no additional obligation
s on the ECB.
  5 Conclusion
: the way ahead and related challenges
 Joining ERM II is a necessary step towards euro adoption.
 At present
, 19 EU 
Member States have adopted a common monetary policy 
with
 the euro as a common 
currency.
 Under the Treaty, all othe
r EU Member States except Denmark are expected 
to introduce the euro once the necessary requirements have been fulfilled.
 From a procedural angle, the decision on e
uro adoption 
is taken 
by the Council 
of the European Union in line with the relevant Treaty 
provisions, including the 
need to stay in ERM II for at least two years
. The process 
is 
defined in Article 140 
and Protocol 13
 of the Treaty and
 can be summari
sed as follows
. After consulting the 
European Parliament and following discussion in the European
 Council, the Council 
shall, 
at the
 proposal 
of the 
European 
Commission, decide which Member States 
with 
a derogation
 fulfil the necessary conditions to adopt the euro. This decision is taken on

nce
 Reports. The next Convergence Reports are e
xpect
ed to be published in the course of 
2022. From a policy standpoint, t
he adopt
ion of
 the euro 
is an opportunity
, albeit 
not a 
guarantee, for Member States to reap substantial benefits
. Most importantly, 
the 
adoption
 of 
a global currency a
s legal tender fosters monetary stability, which 
in 
turn 
manifests itself 
in a stable and 
low real interest rate
 environment. This benefit
, 
however,
 may also expose 
a country to 
vulnerabilities 
if it considers 
monetary stability 
as a 
substitute for 
disciplined and 
sustainable 
economic 
policies.
 Article 140 of t
he 
TFEU
 states 
unambiguous
ly that
 a country should achieve ﬁa 
high degree of susta
inable convergenceﬂ with the euro area 
before introducing 
the euro
. This means that the adoption of the euro should be sustainable over the 
long run
. 
Factors such as 
resilient economic structures
, financial stability, the quality of 
institutions and govern
ance
, and
 the progressive enhancement of EU architecture 
also play a very important role. The convergence process, 
therefore, is not automatic, 
and at country level should be seen rather as a by
-product of relentless policy efforts 
before and after adoptio
n of the euro, i.e. as a continuum. 
It is for these reasons that 
the ECB press releases of 10 July 2020 on the inclusion of 
the Bulgarian lev and 
Croatian kuna in ERM II also emphasised 
a ﬁ
firm commitment
ﬂ by the respective 
authorities ﬁ
to pursue sound eco
nomic policies with the aim of preserving economic 
and financial stability, and achieving a high degree of sustainable economic 
convergence
.ﬂ94 The role of ERM II as a preparatory phase for euro adoption and the regime shift 
this entails raise policy 
challenges that need to be addressed.
 The
 prior 
commitments made 
by the Bulgarian and Croatian authorities 
in recent years have 
spurred
 the introduction of
 important measures that will mitigate risks under ERM II
. 
The additional
, structural 
policy 
measures
 announced
 when they
 join
ed ERM II
 are 
therefore to be welcomed. However, w
hile 
crucial
 steps have been taken 
in both 
countries 
to address macroeconomic imbalances, 
there is still significant 
progress 
to 
be made
 with regard to the overall quality of instit
utions and governance. 
In this 
regard, taking a long
-term view on policymaking will be decisive going forward, 
especially in the light of 
the 
new 
divergence risk
s caused by 
the 
coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) shock.
 Finally, t
hese policy efforts will also 
need to 
include measures aimed 
at prevent
ing
 the euro changeover 
from being
 used by firms and price
-setters as 
an excuse for unwarranted price hikes
 that may harm the trust of the population 
in the single currency
. In this regard, the national authorities, in coope
ration with the 
European Commission and the ECB, can benefit from past
 experience
s with euro 
changeover in other countries, which have included 
measures

 market

 1 Introduction
 The euro area labour market has been severely hit by the coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) pandemic and 
associated 
containment measures.
 Employment and 
total hours 
worked 
declined at the sharpest rates on record. Unemployment increased 
more slowly
 and to a lesser extent
, reflecting the 
high 
take
-up rate of job retention 
schemes and transitions into inactivity. The labou
r market adjustment occurred 
primarily via a strong decline in average hours worked. In addition, the labour force 
declined by about 5 million in the first half of 2020, which is half a million more than its 
increase between mid
-2013 and the fourth quarter
 of 2019.
 Both labour supply and aggregate demand shocks 
help 
explain the decline in 
total hours worked.
 An analysis via a sign
-restricted structural vector
-autoregressive 
model shows that labour supply and productivity shocks together account for about 
one-third of the total decline in hours worked in the second quarter of 2020. This 
reflects both the impact of lockdowns, which forced firms to temporarily close or 
reduce their operations, and the decline in the labour force
, potentially also reflecting 
som
e discouragement in view of the pandemic situation
. The negative aggregate 
demand shock is estimated to account for about one
-quarter of the decline in total 
hours worked, reflecting both demand constraints and
 possible effects of uncertainty 
on consumptio
n behaviour
. The high take
-up of job retention schemes in the euro area significantly affected 
labour market developments.
 As euro area governments introduced containment 
measures to limit the spread of the virus they also devised policies to support the 
labour market, with a particular focus on job retention schemes in the form of 
short
-time work and temporary lay
-offs. These schemes help to explain the adjustment 
via average hours worked. They also help to explain why compensation per employee 
declined si
gnificantly in the euro area during the COVID
-19 pandemic, while 
compensation per hour increased slightly over the same period.
95 High
-frequency 
indicators of labour demand and new hires help to shed light on the impact of the crisis 
on the labour market. T
hese indicators show that 
the 
labour market remained 
depressed 
in the 
fourth
 quarter of 2020
, despite some recovery in employment and 
hours worked in the third quarter
. A prominent feature of the pandemic was 
a shift from office work to 
teleworking.
 While 
teleworkable jobs accounted for 33% of employees in 2019, 
fewer 
than 10% of potential teleworkers
 (3.3% of employees)
 reported working from home 
either 
usually 
or sometimes. That changed with the pandemic and 
associated 
                                                                    95  The consequent decline in household income was buffered to some extent by fiscal subsidies, job 
retention schemes and other support measures.

 impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on the euro area labour market
  106 lockdowns, during which more than a 
third of Europeans began to telework. In the first 
months after the onset of the pandemic, teleworking may have supported employment 
and hours 
worked 
in some sectors, in particular among workers with higher levels of 
education.
 Looking ahead, the pandemic 
is likely to accelerate the ongoing digital 
transformation of the euro area economy, with teleworking and the use of digital 
technology becoming more prominent.
 2 Developments in employment, unemployment and hours 
worked
 The COVID
-19 pandemic led to the sh
arpest contraction on record in 
employment and total hours worked
 in the second quarter of 2020
. There were 
5.2 million fewer persons employed
 in the second quarter 2020
 than at the end of 
2019, a fall of 3.2%. The decline in the number of persons employed
 in the first half of 
2020 corresponds to roughly 4
4% of the increase in the number of persons employed 
since the second quarter of 2013. 
Both employment and hours worked recovered 
somewhat in the third quarter
, but remain
ed substantially below their levels 
in 
the 
fourth quarter of 2019.
 Moreover, d
espite the record low employment
 growth
 observed 
in the first half of 2020, the
 quarter
-on-quarter
 adjustment
s in employment remained 
relatively muted in comparison to the 
changes
 in GDP. Total hours worked 
changed 
substantially more than employment, and also more than GDP. In the second quarter 
of 2020, the quarter most affected by the containment measures, total hours worked 
declined by 16.
8% and average hours worked declined by 1
4.3% in annual terms (see 
Chart 1). The adjustment via the ﬁintensive marginﬂ was facilitated by the high take
-up 
of job retention schemes, which benefited from government efforts to implement new 
schemes or 
to 
considerably expand existing ones (see Sectio
n 3). Box 1 
describes 
the 
nature of the shocks affecting total hours worked and labour force participation.

 The
 impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on the euro area labour market
  107 Labour productivity per employee decreased markedly durin
g the COVID
-19 pandemic, while labour productivity per hour increased slightly.
 In the first half of 
2020, there was a sharp decline in labour productivity per employee, with a 
year
-on-year change of 
-12.1% in the second quarter of 2020, as the sharp drop 
in 
GDP was accompanied by a more moderate fall in employment. By contrast, labour 
productivity per hour increased by 
2.6% year
-on-year
 in the second quarter of 2020
, 
as hours worked dropped more than GDP (see Chart 1). This dichotomy 
between
 productivity p
er person and per hour worked is more marked than in previous 
recessions and reflects the 
very high 
take
-up rate of job retention schemes.
 However, 
labour productivity per person recovered su
bstantially in the third quarter.
 The reaction of the unemploymen
t rate to the fall in activity was more muted 
than 
the reactions 
of employment and total hours worked.
 Between February and 
October
 2020, the unemployment rate 
in the euro area 
increased by only 
1.2 percentage points to 8.
4%, despite the large fall in empl
oyment. 
The unemployment 
rate 
reached 
8.7% in July and 
thereafter 
declined.
 The limited increase in the 
unemployment rate in the euro area during the first months after the onset of the 
COVID
-19 pandemic was in sharp contrast to developments in the United 
States, 
where part of the adjustment occurred via the temporary laying off of workers. These 
are considered unemployed in the United States, whereas in the euro area those 
affected by short
-time work schemes or temporary lay
-offs remain, in most cases, on 
the payroll and are thus not considered unemployed (see Box 2). The more muted 
response of euro area unemployment to the decline in activity 
can be
 attributed not 
only to the job retention schemes that aimed to protect employment and limit 
unemployment, but also to a high number of workers transitioning into inactivity, 
resulting in sharp contractions in labour force participation (see Chart 2). Lock
downs 
and other containment measures suppressed labour demand and discouraged the 
search efforts of some workers who lost their jobs and transited directly into 
inactivity.
96 The labour force recovered substantially in the third quarter
, but remains 
smaller
 than in the fourth quarter of 2019.
                                                                     96  Persons ava
ilable 
for 
but not seeking work increased by 
3.2 million in the first half of 2020
, which 
represents 86% of the total decline in the labour force as measured by the Labour Force Survey. A broad 
measure of labour underutilisation which includes the unemploy
ed, persons available but not seeking, 
persons seeking but not available and part
-time workers who wish to work more hours increased from 
14.6% to 16.3% of the extended labour force between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter 
of 2020. The ext
ended labour force includes 
persons available but not seeking
 and
 persons seeking but 
not available
, in addition to the employed and unemployed.

ship
 between these labour market 
aggregates and GDP had remained stab
le over the first half of 2020. The response of 
employment appears broadly in line with the predictions of the dynamic approach to 
estimating its long

not increased 
relative 
to the second quart
er of 2019, while total hours

 has 
decreased by more than would have been expected when looking at 
its 
long

 In the third quarter 2020, the observed annual growth rates of 
employment and total hours worked appear to have be
en broadly in line with their 
long

than would be expected given its historical co
-movement with GDP.
                                                                     97  This long

of 
the adjustment of the labour market to fluctuations in the business cycle
, whereas a 
dynamic approach allows for a protracted response of the unempl
oyment rate, employment and total 
hours worked to the observed changes in GDP. Independently of the estimation approach, this long
-term 
relationship helps to quantify the observed decline in employment and total hours worked and the 
observed increase in th
e unemployment rate as a result of the fall in economic activity
 in the first half of 
2020.

 Notes: The long

  Key drivers of labour market developments: an SVAR analysis
 Prepared by C
laudia Foroni and Matthias Mohr
 This box assesses recent developments in total hours worked and the labour force
 in the euro area on 
the basis of a sign
-restricted structural vector
-autoregressive model (SVAR). This approach can be 
used to decompose the year
-on-year changes in the four endogenous variables shown in Table
 A into 
the cumulative contributions of four s
pecific economic shocks, comprising (i) a shock giving rise to an 
increase in the demand for labour; (ii) a technology or productivity shock, which can be thought of as 
a sudden change 
in 
the production technology of firms; (iii) a shock constituting an ex
ogenous 
change in the labour supply
 (via a shock to labour force participation)
; and (iv) a wage bargaining 
shock, which can be thought of as a change 
in 
the bargaining power of workers. These shocks are 
unobservable and are identified by imposing restrict
ions on the direction in which the endogenous 
variables move in response to the impact of the shocks, as shown in Table A.
98                                                                     98  The restrictions 
on
 the impact of shocks on the endogenous variables can be derived from theoretical

 Table A
 Restrictions imposed on the impact of shocks on endogenous variables
 Notes: The table shows the restrictions on the sign of the instantaneous impact of each shock (top row) on the 
quarter
-on-quarter change in the respective 
endogenous variable (first column). A ﬁ+ﬂ (ﬁ
-ﬁ) indicates that the variable reacts positively (negatively) on impact to the shock, while an empty cell means that no 
restriction on the direction of the response on
 impact is imposed. The SVAR is estimated using quarter
-on-quarter changes of the variables between the second 
quarter of 1995 and the fourth quarter of 2019. ﬁReal wage
sﬂ is defined as compensation per hour deflated by the GDP deflator.
 From an economic p
oint of view, these shocks can capture various events. An increase in wage 
bargaining power can be related to policy measures, such as an increase in the minimum wage. 
Likewise, structural reforms that aim to reduce labour costs and to make labour markets 
more flexible, 
such as a reduction in unemployment benefits or allowing opt
-outs from collective wage agreements, 
can be considered examples of negative wage bargaining shocks. Positive labour supply shocks can 
be related to migration waves, changes in the
 preferences of workers, or institutional reforms that 
change the size of the labour force, such as an increase in the retirement age. Positive aggregate 
demand shocks comprise events giving rise to an increase in demand for goods and services in the 
domes
tic economy, such as an unexpected increase in foreign demand, or an increase in confidence 
which may incentivise people to spend more on investment or consumption goods. Such a shock 
would, in this context, also increase the demand for labour, so total ho
urs worked would increase. 
Finally, positive productivity shocks can be technological innovations which ease the production or 
distribution of goods and services or give rise to new products, but they also cover the impact of 
economic reforms aimed at impr
oving the supply side of the economy (e.g. increasing competition by 
abolishing inefficient regulations).
 Chart A shows the cumulative effect of the identified shocks on the annual changes in total hours 
worked and the labour force up to the second quarter
 of 2020.
99 As shown in the upper left panel, the 
SVAR model interprets the large decline in total hours worked observed in the second quarter 
of 2020 
as being induced primarily by supply
-side and demand shocks.
100 On the supply side, labour supply 
and produc
tivity shocks together are estimated to account for more than one
-third of the total decline 
in hours worked. This reflects the impact of lockdown and containment measures introduced by 
national governments during the pandemic, which forced many shops and 
firms to temporarily close 
or reduce their operations. Furthermore, the negative impact of the labour supply shock captures 
workers who lost their jobs during the pandemic crisis and did not immediately search for new jobs. 
As these workers were registered
 as inactive, this gave rise to the large decline in the labour force 
recorded during the first two quarters of 2020. The impact of a negative demand shock is estimated to 
account for about one
-quarter of the decline in total hours worked in the second qua
rter. This reflects 
constraints on the demand for services as a consequence of the lockdown measures as well as other 
                                                                    99  The shocks are obtained by estimating an SVAR model
 with time
-invariant parameters for the euro area, 
with the sign restrictions defined in Table A, from the second quarter of
 1995
 to the fourth quarter of
 2019. 
The shocks for the first and second quarters of 2020 are obtained 
on the basis of the estimated
 past 
shocks, the estimated parameters and the available data for the four variables in this period.
 While the 
model is estimated using quarterly changes of the endogenous variables, the 
charts in this box 
show the 
decomposition of the changes transformed 
into annual rates of change.
 The residual component 
captures the unconditional mean of the variables.
 100  In the first quarter, t
he pandemic 
impacted the economy primarily in the last month, 
March
. Looking at the 
results for the first two quarters of 2020 p
rovides a similar picture to the one described here for the 
second quarter of 2020.

, which restrained consumption. The 
impact of a positive wage mark
-up shock
 is estimated to explain less than one
-tenth of the observed 
decline in total hours worked in the second quarter, mainly on account of an observed strong increase

y, the 
large decline in labour force participation is mostly explained by the impact of the labour supply shock,

 While the responses of total hours
 worked and the size of the labour force 
have been 
significantly 
larger in the 
current 
COVID
-19 pandemic than 
during 
the financial crisis, a comparison of the impacts 
of shocks in the two recessions highlights interesting similarities but also important di
fferences. As in 
the 
current 
pandemic, the largest part of the decline in total hours worked during the financial crisis 
was also explained by labour supply, productivity and demand shocks (see Chart
 A, lower left panel). 
However, unlike in the 
current 
pandemic, the dominant shock during the trough of the financial crisis 
in 2009 was the demand shock, which accounted for a larger share of the decline in total hours 
worked than the two supply
-side shocks. Finally, in both recessions, labour supply shocks wer
e the 
main contributors to the decline in the labour force, which in both cases was accompanied by a 
decline in total hours worked.

  The impact of the COVID
-19 crisis on the labour market in the United States
 Prepared by Ramon Gomez Salvador
 The broa
d-based shutdown of the US economy put in place to control the COVID
-19 outbreak led to 
an unprecedented rise in unemployment and a fall in labour force participation. Between February 
and April 2020 around 25 million jobs were lost and the unemployment ra
te increased from 3.5% to 
14.7% (see Chart A), with workers that were temporarily laid off accounting for 75% of the new 
unemployed.
101 In the first six weeks of the shutdown around 30 million people applied for 
unemployment benefit, while 8 million workers 
left the labour force in March and April.

g indicates recession dates announced by the NBER Business Cycle Dating 
Committee. Latest observation: 
October
 2020.
 The decline in employment has been unprecedented compared to previous recessions. One relevant 
aspect for understanding the increase in unemployment is its link to the decline in employment 
related 
to developments in labour force participation. Chart B sho
ws that in past recessions the bulk of the 
increase in unemployment 
was 
related to the decline in employment. By contrast, in the COVID
-19 crisis, not only has the decline in employment been 
high 
compared to previous recessions, but the 
decline in particip
ation has also limited the increase in unemployment to a greater extent than in the 
past. Hours 
worked 
per worker also showed a slightly more marked adjustment than in previous 
recessions (see Chart B).
                                                                     101  In the United States, workers on temporary lay
-offs are those classified as unemployed who have been 
given a date to return to work or who expect to return to work withi
n 
six
 months.
 102  The severe adjustment took place despite the introduction of measures to contain unemployment, 
including: (i) the Paycheck 
Protection 
Program, which provides loans and guarantees to companies with 
up to 500 employees to cover payroll 
costs, mortgage or rent payments, utilities and health benefits
, where 
the loans are eligible for partial or total forgiveness if the firm maintains most of its pre
-crisis 
employees on 
the 
payroll; and (ii) the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a tax credit e
qual to 50
% of the 
qualified wage paid by eligible employers 
until the end of 
2020, provided businesses keep workers on 
their payroll.

 Note: The chart shows 
cumulative developments over the course of each recession.
 Despite the rapid bounce back of the labour market, it will take time for the unemployment rate to 
fall 
back 
to pre
-COVID
-19 levels. The unemployment rate declined to 
6.9% in 
October
, 
7.8 percentag
e points below its April high. Between April and 
October
, the number of employed workers increased by 
16.4 million 
owing 
to the re
-insertion into the labour market of temporarily laid
-off workers. The 
number of hours worked per week has also shown signs of
 recovery. Nonetheless, according to the

  3 Job retention schemes
 Job retention schemes reached unprecede
nted levels in the first months after 
the onset of the COVID
-19 pandemic and thus play an important role in 
explaining labour market developments in this period.
 In April 2020, when 
lockdown measures to contain the spread of COVID
-19 were in place in most 
euro 
area countries, including the four largest ones, 1
5% of all employees in Germany, 3
4% in France, 
30% in Italy and 2
1% in Spain were on short
-time work (see Chart 4). While 
these levels have since declined, they still remain elevated.
 In the fourth qua
rter
 of 
2020 the 
number of workers in job retention schemes
 is expected to increase
 in 
response to the new lockdown measures
. To put these numbers into perspective, in 
2009 the average share of employees participating in short
-time work schemes 
reached 3.2
% in Germany, 0.8% in France, 3.3% in Italy and 1.0% in Spain.
103 These 
schemes help to explain the adjustment in the labour market via average hours 
worked. They also help to explain why compensation per employee declined

 The large number of workers on job retention schemes benefited from rapid 
policy responses to support the labour market during the early stages of the 
pandemic.
 National governments of euro area countries implemented extensive 
labour market policies at the 
onset of the COVID
-19 pandemic. Job retention schemes 
featured prominently and were widely adopted across the euro area. These measures 
were designed to support workers™ incomes and to protect jobs in firms during the 
COVID
-19 pandemic.
104 Some countries int
roduced new short
-time work schemes 
and others overhauled existing schemes by increasing their generosity, broadening 
eligibility and reducing the administrative burden of accessing the schemes. There 
was also support for these schemes at EU level.
105 Job re
tention schemes help to keep employment stable in the short
 term, but 
it 
is important 
to design them in a way that 
limit
s undesirable effects.
 In particular, 
these schemes played an important role at the onset of the COVID
-19 pandemic when 
firms faced a su
dden contraction in their sales. They helped to reduce firms™ liquidity 
needs, while allowing them to resume activity more swiftly after the lockdown by 
keeping employment relationship
s intact. Some studies have analysed the causal 
impact of short
-time wor
k on employment and concluded that these schemes helped 
to save jobs when firms faced a sharp drop in demand.
106 These effects could also be 
                                                                    104  See the box entitled

 potentially higher for highly leveraged firms.
107 However, job retention schemes also 
entail some degree of deadweight 
losses (when they subsidise jobs that would not 
have been lost) and displacement effects (when they subsidise unviable jobs). Some 
studies suggest that short
-time work schemes may decrease the allocative efficiency 
of the economy when used on a large scale
 for an extended period of time.
108 For 
these reasons they should be limited in duration in order 
not 
to 
hinder 
necessary 
economic restructuring, while remaining in place long enough to preserve viable jobs 
that might otherwise be lost.
109 These risks are likely to be significantly lower during 
the COVID
-19 crisis than in cyclical downturns. In addition, some countries adjusted 
the generosity of their job retention schemes when extending their duration after the 
first months of the pandemic
. Structural features affect the margins of adjustment of the labour market, but 
the nature of the shock, in conjunction with the institutional frameworks of the 
labour market in Europe, led to widespread adoption of the intensive margin of 
adjustment.
 A n
umber of euro area countries are characterised by relatively strict 
employment protection legislation, making the use of short
-time work schemes more 
attractive than dismissals when firms are faced with a temporary drop in demand. In 
some countries, high e
mployment protection leads to segmented labour markets and 
temporary workers are used as a buffer against demand fluctuations. However, the 
nature and magnitude of the COVID
-19 crisis, and the implementation of measures to 
ease access to short
-time work, l
ed to widespread use of the intensive margin of 
adjustment across most euro area countries. This high reliance on the intensive 
margin of adjustment may also be reflected in lower job creation in the recovery 
period.

  Developments in compensation per
 hour and per employee since the start of the COVID
-19 
pandemic
 Prepared by Gerrit Koester
 and Elke Hahn
 Aggregate wage growth is mostly assessed in terms of compensation per employee or compensation 
per hour worked. For the euro area these two indicators 
tend to move broadly in tandem during 
normal times (see Chart A, panel a). However, at other times they can diverge substantially, 
reflecting, for instance, (temporary) reductions in hours worked per employee (the ﬁintensive marginﬂ) 
where employees are no
t forced to absorb these reduced hours in their monthly salaries. 
Developments during the global financial crisis of 2008
-09 provide a historical example.

 The
 impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on the euro area labour market
  116
 The COVID
-19 pandemic has led to a substantial divergence between compensation per employee 
and compe
nsation per hour. 
This has been visible since the start of the pandemic, especially i
n the 
second quarter of 2020
, when
 compensation per employee declined at an annual rate of 4.
7% and compensation per hour increased by 9.
3%, although the differences moder
ated again in the third 
quarter of 2020
 (see Chart A, panel b). The number of workers on job retention schemes
, which has 
remained elevated since the start of the pandemic and peaked in the second quarter 
(see 
Chart 4 in 
the main text)
, 
played a decisive r
ole in these developments
, especially via the implications for hours 
worked per person
. Such schemes tend to have a downward effect on compensation per employee, 
as employees usually retain their employment status but face pay cuts when enrolling in these 
schemes. At the same time, they have an upward effect on compensation per hour, as hours worked 
tend to be reduced far more strongly than pay.
110 A further factor complicating the assessment of 
underlying wage trends during the pandemic is compositional effe
cts. As employment declined 
particularly strongly among low
-skilled jobs and young workers (see Chart 9 in the main text), which 
tend to be in the lower wage groups, compositional effects may currently be having an upward effect 
on wage developments.
111                                                                     110  See

 (year
-on-year percentage changes; percentage point contributions; quarterly data)
 Sources: ECB, national central banks and Eurostat.
 Notes: Given the recent strong movements observed in compensation per employee and compensation per hour, the year

three
 quarters are shown on a separate scale in panel b. Latest observation: second quarter of 2020
 for the labour
 cost index and third quarter of 2020 for the rest.
 The operation of government support measures complicates the assessment of underlying wage 
trends during the pandemic. First, information on how much of the aggregate compensation and how 
many of the empl
oyees are attributable to job retention schemes requires detailed data on wage 
replacement rates and take
-up rates, which are published only with a considerable time lag. Second, 
the statistical recording can differ across countries. While in most large eu
ro area countries the 
benefits provided under the support schemes are paid directly to employees and are recorded as 
social transfers, in the Netherlands, for example, employers receive a subsidy to finance their 
payments to employees. If the benefits are 
paid directly to employees but are recorded as social 
transfers, then compensation relative to the number of hours worked decreases and the schemes will 
have a strong downward effect on compensation per employee, while compensation per hour should 
be affec
ted much less strongly. By contrast, in countries where a scheme is based on a subsidy paid 
to employers, who then pay salaries for hours not worked, the schemes should not lead to a strong 
reduction in compensation per employee but mainly imply a higher c
ompensation per hour.

 The
 impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on the euro area labour market
  118
 Against the background of scheme
-related distortions in compensation per employee and per hour, 
relevant signals for wage 
cost 
developments might be distilled from
, inter alia, 
Eurostat™s labour cost 
index 
(LCI), which 
effectively 
mea
sures developments in compensation per hour
, including 
employers™ social security contributions and taxes paid but subtracting subsidies received by 
employers. 
According to the 
LCI, 
in the second quarter of 2020 hourly labour costs 
in the euro area 
rose by
 4.2% compared with the same quarter 
in 
the previous year (see chart A
, panel b), which was 
substantially 
lower than the increase in 
compensation per hour.
112 This indicates that the decrease in 
the number of hours worked due to the COVID
-19 crisis was not fully 
matched
 by a 
corresponding 
increase 
in 
firms™ costs, as in some cases firms received 
subsidies introduced by euro area 
governments to support 
job reten
tion during 
the crisis. 
 Overall, wage developments are an important determinant of price pressures in the euro area.
113 The 
strong and unprecedented divergence in the development of different wage indicators 
in the 
COVID
-19 crisis and the large and heteroge
neous effects of job retention schemes across euro area 
countries complicate the assessment of underlying wage pressures and thus also their impact on 
prices. This highlights the importance of the availability of detailed and timely information on the 
impa
ct of such schemes on indicators of wage growth.
  4 Using high
-frequency indicators to assess labour market 
developments
 High
-frequency indicators are a useful tool for gaining a timely understanding 
of labour market developments, particularly in periods o
f rapid and drastic 
changes in economic activity.
 For example, Google Trends provides information 
about the interests of people using the Google search engine to search specific topics
, such as job retention schemes and unemployment conditions. Two other s
ources that 
can be used as a more direct measure of demand conditions in the labour market are 
Indeed
 job postings and the 
LinkedIn
 hiring rate.
114 The number of job postings on 
Indeed
 can be used as a proxy for changes in labour demand, while the 
LinkedIn
 hiring rate provides complementary information about the number of job changes. 
These indicators are available well ahead of the publication of official labour market 
statistics and thus provide valuable timely information which can 
aid the early 
identifica
tion of 
changes in labour demand and job findings. However, they need to be 
used as a complement to official statistics as they do not follow the same sampling 
rules and may not represent developments in the population with the same accuracy 
as official la
bour market statistics.
 The Google Trends high
-frequency awareness indicator on job retention 
schemes and unemployment conditions peaked after the start of lockdown in 
                                                                    112  The stronger increase in the LCI in 2019 was partly linked to 
a permanent reduction in employers™ social 
security contributions in France, replacing the 
tax credit for employment and competitiveness (
crédit 
d™impôt pour la compétitivité et l™emploi
 Œ CICE), 
from the 
first quarter of 2019.

 the five largest euro area countries (see Chart 5).
 The awareness indicator on job 
reten
tion schemes and unemployment conditions is based on Google Trends data and 
is constructed by looking at searches related to lay
-offs, short
-time working, furlough 
and unemployment. This indicator provides daily information on the level of interest of 
user
s in the labour market situation. In particular, Google searches related to job 
retention schemes and unemployment conditions skyrocketed in mid
-March, with a 
relatively good match between peak interest in the labour market situation and the 
starting dates
 of the lockdowns implemented in the 
five 
largest euro area countries.
115 As containment measures eased, the awareness indicator reverted to its 
usual 
levels.

average of the daily Google Trends popularity of the terms ﬁlay

-time workingﬂ, ﬁfurloughﬂ and ﬁunemploymentﬂ. Latest 
observation: 15 September 2020.
 The hiring rate and job postings indicator
s provide further evidence of the 
strong impact of the pandemic on the labour market.
 The 
LinkedIn
 hiring rate 
indicator is more closely related to job
-to
-job transitions and the job
-finding rate, while 
the 
Indeed
 job postings indicator reflects developments in labour demand and may be 
regarded as an indicator of vacancies. Both indicator
s declined sha
rply in March and 
April as the pandemic took hold and lockdown measures were implemented (see 
Chart 
6). The hiring rate bottomed out in May and recovered substantially thereafter, 
but remains at much lower levels than in the previous year. Job postings fol
lowed the 
same declining pattern as the hiring rate, but have 
only
 started to 
recover
 at a slow 
pace 
and remain at broadly the same low levels as those reached in May. The 
                                                                    115  The awareness indicator peaked one day after the lockdown started in Germany, three days after the 
lockdown started in France, seven
 days after the lockdown started in Spain, and six days after the 
lockdown started in the Netherlands. By contrast, in Italy the peak of the awareness of job retention 
schemes and unemployment conditions was slightly delayed relative to the start of the co
ntainment 
measures in that country.
 116  This reflects not only the improvements observed in economic activity following the eas
ing
 of 
containment measures and then the eas
ing
 of the restrictions 
on 
travel within the euro area, but also a 
decrease in the unc
ertainty associated with the implementation

demographic groups and types of job
 The COVID
-19 pandemic is having a heterogeneous
 impact on euro area labour 
markets across various dimensions.
 This section analyses differences in the 
impact of the pandemic across euro area countries and across activity sectors, as 
some sectors are more exposed to changes in demand patterns than other
s. It also 
analyses the impact of the pandemic across demographic groups and types of 
employment 
contract. 
In addition, t
he section discusses the adoption of teleworking 
during the pandemic and the potential for its further use.
 The impact of the COVID
-19 
pandemic on the labour market is very
 negative 
and widespread across euro area countries
. Lockdown restrictions across the euro 
area began to be introduced at the end of February and began to be eased from 
mid
-May. While the precise start and end dates of 
the lockdown restrictions varied, the 
bulk of the impact on economic activity and job losses materialised in the second 
quarter of 2020. Chart 7 shows the cumulative impact on the labour market of 
the 
pandemic 
in the first t
hree
 quarter
s of 2020 across the
 five largest euro area countries. 
While the contraction in employment was 
substantial
 across all large countries, there 
is some
 cross

heterogeneity,
 reflecting

 the intensity of
 policy 
responses to
 the pandemic and

ositions of the economies.

 Changes in employment and hours worked
 (index: Q4 2019 = 100
)  Sources: Eurostat and authors™ calculations.
 Total hours worked declined in all main sectors in the euro area in the second 
quarter of 2020.
 The extent of the decline was different across sectors, partly 
reflecting the strictness of the lockdown measures affecting each sector.
117 A comparison with the first quarter of 2009, when growth in employment and total hours 
worked reached a trough during
 the financial crisis, shows that the quarter
-on-quarter 
decline in total hours worked was larger in all key sectors in the recent 
pandemic
-related recession (see Chart 8). Quarter
-on-quarter, the decline in total 
hours worked in recreation services in the
 second quarter of 2020 was 40 times larger 
than the corresponding decline recorded in the first quarter of 2009, while in the trade 
and transport sector, the decline was 15 times larger. Employment growth in the 
second quarter of 2020 was also more varied
 across key sectors than in the first 
quarter of 2009. Still, the sectoral pattern of the decline in total employment is more 
comparable than the sectoral pattern of the decline in total hours worked to the pattern 
observed during the financial crisis. Thi
s reflects the widespread use of job retention 
measures to stabilise employment in the current pandemic recession. While job 
retention schemes have helped to stabilise employment, such policies may also 
hinder the efficient reallocation of workers across s
ectors. Such reallocation is 
expected to be larger the longer the pandemic lasts.
                                                                     117  For a discussion on how various sectoral outcomes may be related

 The decline in e

was strongest 
for temporary employees, the young 
and workers with low levels of education.
 Chart 9, panel a, shows that employment 
of workers with a high level of education was virtually unaffected by the pandemic, 
whereas workers with 
a low level of education saw a sharp decline in their 
employment. Likewise, young workers were disproportionately affected when 
compared to older worke
rs. Employment also declined more for women
 than for men
, although the difference is relatively small. Across 
contract 
types, employment 
decreased most for temporary employees (see Chart 9, panel b). 
In line 
with the fall in 
employment, the youth unemploym
ent rate increased significantly more than the 
overall unemployment rate (see Chart 9, panel c).

 The
 impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on the euro area labour market
  124 likely to have supported employment and hours worked in s
ome sectors and for some 
workers, in particular those with a high level of education. Among those who worked 
remotely during the pandemic, a large majority had previous teleworking experience, 
suggesting that investigating the pre
-COVID
-19 distribution of 
teleworkable jobs could 
provide insights into the dynamics of the European and euro area labour markets in 
the context of the pandemic (see Box 4).
 Box 4
  Teleworkable jobs
 Prepared by Colm Bates and Lara Vivian
 This box analyses teleworking patterns in th
e EU and the United Kingdom. In order to disentangle 
occupations which can be performed from home from those which require presence in the workplace, 
we combine a teleworking index with individual
-level data for 2019 for EU Member States and the 
United Kin
gdom.
119 Potentially teleworkable occupations include clerks, information and 
communication technicians, and most managers and professionals. On the other hand, some jobs in, 
for example, sales, cleaning and health rely on workplace attendance in order to be
 carried out.
 In 2019 teleworkable jobs accounted for 33% of employees and 46% of annual earnings in the euro 
area, suggesting that remote working is more prevalent in highly
-paid jobs (see Chart A). These 
shares each increase by one percentage point when 
also considering other EU countries and the 
United Kingdom. Despite methodological differences, the results are similar to those for the United 
States, where 37% of jobs and 46% of wages were identified as suitable for teleworking (Ding
el and 
Neiman, 2020)
. In the euro area, the share of teleworkable jobs is highest in the information and 
communication sector and lowest in agriculture. Occupations which are conducive to teleworking 
account for 83% of employees and 87% of annual earnings in the information a
nd communication 
sector. In agriculture, by contrast, teleworking is only possible for 7% of workers, but their earnings 
represent almost one fifth of total earnings in the industry. Sectors where more than 40% of jobs can 
be performed remotely, namely edu
cation, financial activities, public administration, real estate and 
other administrative activities, account for around 30% of total employees in the euro area. The 
remaining 70% of employees are spread across industries where remote working is an option 
for no 
more than 25% of workers. In addition, less than 10% of potential teleworkers in the euro area report 
working from home either 
usually
 or sometimes, meaning that two
-thirds of workers might not be 
familiar with remote working.
120                                                                     119  The teleworking index is based on

and 
Neiman, B.

many 
jobs 
can 
be done at 
home?
ﬂ,
 Journal of Public Economics
, Vol. 
189, 
2020, pp. 
1-8. Dingel and Neiman assign to occupations a
 degree 
of teleworkability ranging from 0 to 1
, where
 0 implies
 that
 no 
jobs 
in that 
occupation
 can be performed via 
teleworking 
and 
1 implies 
that all jobs in
 that occupation 
can
 be performed 
via teleworking
. In this 
analysis, the classification is applied 
to the International Standard Classification of Occupations 
(ISCO
-08) via a crosswalk table provided by the United States Bureau 
of 
Labor Statistics (
see 
ﬁCrosswalks between the 2010 SOC and systems used by other Federal and international statistical 
agenc
iesﬂ, 
Bureau of Labor Statistics
, 2012)
. In addition, we use employee weights to match the index to 
a broader ISCO
-08 aggregate. The purpose of this exercise is to combine the index with individual
-level 
data, namely from th
e European Labour Force Survey (
EU-LFS), European Statistics on Income and 
Living Conditions (EU
-SILC) and the German Socio
-Economic Panel (SOEP).
 For each data source, we 
consider the most recent survey available 
Œ 2019 for EU
-LFS and 2018 for the EU
-SILC and SOEP (see 
ﬁSocio
-Economic Panel 
(SOEP),
 data 
from
 1984
-2018
ﬂ, version 35, SOEP, 2019). O
ccupations with a 
teleworkability 
score 
above 0.5 are identified as suitable for remote working.
 120  The Labour Force Survey 
asks respondents whether they work from home. However, an answer of 
ﬁusuallyﬂ or ﬁsometimesﬂ does not necessarily mean that the individual teleworks or that their job is 
entirely teleworkable. For instance, teachers might say that they work from home at ti
mes to prepare 
classes, but this does not necessarily mean that they have taught a class from home.

 Notes:
 For the euro area and each sector, the chart shows the share of annual earnings generated by potential teleworking jobs (oran
ge bar) and the share of 
employees in potential teleworking jobs (blue dot), including those who currently telework (green bar) an
d those who don™t (yellow bar). The figures below the 
bars show the percentage of the total workforce and 
the percentage 
of all potential teleworkers in each sector. Teleworking index aggregated at the ISCO
-08 2-digit level using employee weights. Slovakia
, Slovenia and Malta are not included.
 The share of employees in potentially teleworkable jobs is above 50% in the capital regions of the 
United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Sweden, while it is around 20% in some regions 
of Spain, Greece and Ro
mania (see Figure A). Similarly, the share of workers who work from home 
either regularly or 
occasionally
 varies substantially across regions. As many as 70% of potential 
teleworkers report working from home in Stockholm, while this share is around 45% in 
Paris and 
London. On the other hand, less than 10% of potential teleworkers engage in remote working in Italy. 
These pre
-pandemic
 differences in potential and actual take
-up rates for teleworking suggest that 
there were differing degrees of preparedness 
to
 promptly deploy remote working as a tool to cope 
with the pandemic across European regions. Such differences might arise, for instance, from 
heterogeneous social norms and stigma linked to working from home, as well as from limitations 
related to digital 
equipment and skills. The latter refers to a bundle of tools which would ease remote 
working, ranging from suitable broadband connections to training 
aimed 
at addressing the challenges 
of remote working environments. Looking ahead, the COVID
-19 crisis coul
d accelerate the adoption 
of teleworking and reduce the digital divide across European countries if countries that are lagging 
behind invest more in digital technologies.

. 6 Concluding remarks
 The large government support
 in the form of job ret
ention schemes
 alleviated 
the impact of the pandemic on the labour market
. It is estimated that in April the 
number of workers in these schemes reached 32 million, which was almost three 
times higher than the number of unemployed. The number of furloughed 
workers has 
since declined and was estimated at 
around
 8 million in 
October
 2020. Owing to the 
very large number of workers subject to temporary conditions, caution is required 
when interpreting 
official labour market statistics. In particular, job retenti
on schemes 
have helped to contain a further increase in unemployment and a stronger decrease in 
employment. However, it remains unclear how many of these workers will successfully 
move back to their normal working hours and how many may be at risk of losin
g their 
jobs. The still large number of workers in job retention schemes and the sharp decline 
in labour market participation suggest that the slack in the labour market is 
substantially greater than captured by the unemployment rate. The reliance on job 
retention schemes was also complemented by the adoption of labour market policies 
at EU level, including the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate 
unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE). This created a Union
-wide solidarity 
toolkit to hel
p national governments address sudden increases in public expenditure in 
order to preserve employment.
 The crisis
 is likely to
 lead to an increase in labour reallocation needs, and these 
are expected to be greater the longer the pandemic lasts.

 The
 impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on the euro area labour market
  127 labour market policies was designed with a view to protecting workers from a 
temporary adverse shock to the economy. They 
have 
helped protect household 
income and limit negative feedback loops. Labour reallocation will crucially depend 
on the duration of the crisis and possible structural shifts in demand. However, the longer 
the shock lasts, the more job reallocation may be required. The COVID
-19 shock is 
also boosting the automation and digitalisation process
, and the skills content of
 existing jobs may need to be upgraded, which may increase the mismatch in the 
labour market.
122 In 
this context
, job retention schemes could combine employment 
protection with training provision with a view to facilitating restructuring and supporting 
the u
pgrading of skills. In addition, the heterogeneous impact of the 
pandemic 
across 
countries may have scarring effects and lead to further divergence 
between 
euro area 
labour markets. Greater skills mismatches and more geographic dispersion in the 
unemployme
nt rate were a persistent outcome of the previous crisis and led to an 
increase in the average duration of unemployment, which can eventually lead to 
higher structural unemployment.

 1 Introduction
 Digitalisation 
Œ the diffusion of digital technologies leading to a digital economy 
Œ is 
ﬁvirtually everywhere
ﬂ. It transforms patterns of consumption and production
, 
business models, preferences and relative prices, and thereby entire economies, 
making it an important issue from a central banking perspective.
 Some of the key 
effects of digitalisation relevant to monetary policy relate to output and productivity, 
labo
ur markets, wages and prices.
 The impact of digitalisation on the economy is a function
, inter alia,
 of national 
economic structure and economic policies, institutions and governance.
 However, it is not clear whether digitalisation is going to deepen diffe
rences between 
countries or reduce them. It is nevertheless interesting to note that the degree of 
digitalisation varies across the euro area and EU countries and only a few are as 
digitalised as the most digital countries in the world.
 This article mainly
 summarises and updates the evidence on the euro area and 
the EU digital economy, including international comparisons.
124 It documents 
the growth 
of the digital economy, measured in terms of value added
 based on the
 System of 
National 
Accounts, the diffusion
 of digital technologies as captured by 
suitable indicators
, 
and the impact of digital technologies on the 
economic 
environment 
in which 
monetary policy
 operates through their effects on productivity, 
labour markets and inflation.
125 This article 
also takes 
a closer look at the impact of the coronavirus (COVID
-19) 
pandemic on the digital economy.
 Since 
the start of the pandemic, both producers 
and consumers 
have become 
more
 accustomed to
 and more reliant on 
digital 
technologies
. Greater take
-up of digital
 tec
hnologies may lead to an acceleration of 
the structural change that it implies and provide both 
opportunities 
and challenges 
for 
countries in the euro area and the broader EU.
 It is important to note that digitalisation may have implications for the econom
y beyond those covered in this article.
 It may affect market structure and competition, 
with repercussions on innovation and the role of intangibles, and cause distributional 
issues. Digitalisation may also affect choices around work and leisure and have f
urther 
                                                                    124  The contents of this article build on Anderton,

 125  Digitalisation may also have welfare effects which are, however, not looked at in this article.
 Such 
welfare

or free 
services), non
-market production (supported by digital products or information) and online shopping and 
the sharing economy (with lower prices and greater variet

 Section

insights and draws out the article™s main messages.
 2 The size and growth of the digital economy
 The digital economy is smaller in the euro area and EU than in the United 
States, and the gap has not changed dramati
cally in the past few years.
 Most 
euro area countries have much smaller value added from digital sectors (as a 
percentage of GDP) than the 
United States
, with the euro area digital economy about 
two
-thirds the size of that of the United States (see Chart 1
). 
In the United States, the 
digital 
service sector 
alone contributes as much as the entire digital economy in the 
euro area
. The size of the 
IT manufacturing sector 
in the United States is 
around 
twice 
that of 
the euro area and 
larger even than in 
countri
es specialised in manufacturing 
activities, such as Germany
.126 For most countries in the euro area, the annual 
percentage point increase in the share of the digital economy has been less than 0.1, 
the same as in the United States, leaving the gap more or le
ss unchanged.

 there are 
certain caveats when comparing countries and interpreting the digital 
economy
™s subsectors. For example, some countries may have a high share of value added in the IT 
manufacturing subsector, but this 
can
 sometimes correspond to the outsourcing of computer parts to that 
country
; therefore,
 high country shares of value added in th
at sector do not necessarily indicate that the 
country is at the forefront of digitalisation.

 3 Productivit
y and the supply side
 Productivity
 The
 last two decades have seen a protracted slowdown in productivity across 
advanced economies
. Productivity growth in the euro area started to slow 
significantly in the mid
-to
-late 1990s, well before other advanced 
econo
mies
, but
 the
 slowdown eventually became widespread even before the financial crisis. It was 
driven primarily by lower growth in total factor productivity (TFP) in the pre
-crisis era, 
but in later years also by lower levels of capital deepening (capital pe
r unit of labour), a 
                                                                    127  The public sector can 
play an important role in 
an economy™s 
overall digital adoption. The transformation 
of public administration, the promotion of digital opti
ons in public education, 
and
 the use of digital 
technologies in the public health sector may serve as triggers for
 a broader spread, and broader 
acceptance, of digital technologies across the entire economy. Some of the most digital economies in the 
euro a
rea 
score
 highly in this respect

s and a large increase in ICT capital deepening and higher TFP in the sectors that use 
ICT most intensively.
129 By contrast, European economies
 were late to develop or use 
these
 technologie
s. One reason for that may be related to the nature of ICT relative t
o older technologies.
 Machines and equipment
 were
 traditionally complementary to any 
type of labour, so the mere accumulation of su
ch capital
 was sufficient to generate 
growth. By contrast, ICT capi
tal requires skilled labour and the adaptation and 
rethink
ing of 
organisational processes
, along with
 other relevant changes, which 
poses challenges to existing firms. As such, ICT capital is complementary to a more 
complex set of other inputs and synthesising them efficiently can generate higher 
productivity ret
urns from ICT investment
.130 Differences in management practices ha
ve emerged as a key explanation for 
why some countries are better
 at exploiting ICT
. Bloom et al.
131 show that 
UK-based firms owned by US firms are more productive, owing to higher ICT
-related 
productivity. They attribute this to the more flexible and decentralised organisational 
structures of US firms.
132 Poor management may be especially problematic in relation 
to ICT given that the dispersion of firm
-specific shocks has risen 
(Decker et al.
 133), possibly as a result of the higher pace of technological change, which amplifies the 
importance of agile and flexible management. The productivity of frontier firms has, in 
fact, been growing rapidly, but laggard firms have been slow to catch up, suggesti
ng                                                                     128  Classification is based on the purchases of ICT assets and services over the value added of the sector.

  132 bottlenecks in innovation diffusion (Andrews et al.
134). Schivardi and Schmitz
135 show 
that countries whose firms had adopted good management practices achieved much 
faster productivity growth than others in the 1995
-2008 period (when ICT
-driven 
productivit
y growth in the United States took off) than the previous decade.
 Technology adoption can be also affected by policy.
 Even if firms have the 
capabilities to exploit digital technologies, they will only adopt them if doing so is 
profitable; low levels of co
mpetition may lower such profits. Andrews et al.
136 show 
that the gap between laggard and frontier firms is higher for industries that are less 
affected by pro
-competitive reforms (such as retail compared with 
telecommunications). At the same time, given tha
t firms need to be able to attract 
skilled workers and respond to changing needs, rigid employment protection 
legislation (EPL) may make it harder for firms to attract these workers and adopt new 
technologies. Andrews et al.
137 provide evidence that higher E
PL is associated with 
lower adoption of a set of digital technologies for sectors characterised by a high 
technological need for employee turnover. 
Cette et al
.138 show that higher EPL leads 
to 
(i) 
positive effects for non
-ICT physical capital intensity and the share of high
-skilled 
employment and (ii) negative effects for 
research and development
 capital intensity 
and the share of low
-skilled employment. As such, EPL implies a high cost of 
low
-skill
ed labour, which is 
substituted 
by non
-ICT capital
.139 There are substantial difference
s between digital and non
-digital companies in 
their productivity distribution and 
leadership persistence
. Using firm
-level data 
for the ﬁbig fourﬂ euro area countries, th
e top panel in Chart 3 shows the relative 
productivity of digital, compared with non
-digital, firms across the distribution.
140 For 
the most part, digital firms are less productive than their non
-digital peers, but for firms 
at the top decile of their respec
tive distributions, digital firms are substantially more 
productive. They are also younger and larger across the distribution. Moreover, 
productivity leadership persistence is higher for the digital sector. The bottom panel in 
Chart 3 shows the average ran
king of the top 1% productive firms in their sector in any 
given year as time passes; while on average leaders remain highly productive, 
persistence in leadership is substantially higher for digital firms. At the same time, the 
rise of new leaders seems br
oadly similar across 
sectors.

142). It is the combined effect 
of these three qualities that makes GPTs 
unique and leads to their singular productivity effects. At the same time, this implies 
that GPTs have very long implementation lags, of several decades for modern 
technologies such as the steam engine, electricity 
or ICT (
Bresnahan and 
Trajtenber
g143, Nordhaus
144). Adapting production and managerial practices to a new 
technology can be a long process. Investment in physical capital is lumpy, given 
adjustment costs, while the production of technology itself becomes more 
efficient 
over time. Skilled workers may also be hard to come by, especially before the new 
technology has become sufficiently widespread for a large enough scholarly base to 
be created, so that the technology can be taught on a massive scale. Complementar
y capital from peripheral innovations needs to be accumulated, which also takes 
time.
145, 146 Supply side
 Digital investments 
are 
often investment
s in intangibles.
 One of the defining 
features of the digital economy is the shift away from physical capital (bui
lding and 
equipment) towards intangible capital 
(for example: research and development,
 software, algorithms, 
databases 
and related analytics)
.147 According to some 
estimates, between one
-third (for the less digital economies) and two
-thirds (for the 
more di
gital economies) of digital investments are in intangibles.
 An important aspect of digital inta
ngible investment is
 big data.
 The term refers 
not only to the size and complexity of a dataset, but also to its
 corresponding analytic
s. It is
 one of the digita
l technologies with the largest take
-up across firms
.148 As with 
intangible assets in general, b
ig data can 
take
 very different forms
 and are often highly 
firm
-specific, i.e. not particularly valuable outside of the firm (an example of the ﬁsunkﬂ 
aspect of i
ntangible assets).
149 Big data
 can be collected 
through
 online platforms 
and service providers
 and can be processed
 and analysed to 
generate revenues in many 
ways, e.g. through targeted advertising. 
The value of such data capital is difficult to

9.150 Alternative sources of finance to
 traditional bank financing 
appear better suited 
to the financing of i
ntangible investment, which is hard to
 collateralise.
 This 
is because of
 the higher uncertainty and risk associated with intangibles (
owing
 to their 
exploratory nature), combined with issues relating to their transferability
, in 
compar
ison
 with
 the more physical nature of tangible investment.
 Traditional 
intermediaries, such as local banks, often lack the sophistication necessary to 
evaluate risky projects involving innovative ideas based on complex technologies, 
while small firms lack the internal funds and reputation required to signal their 
quality 
to investors. 
Equity financing and 
venture capital 
may be more 
suitable for 
funding 
intangible 
investment
, hence the latter may be disadvantaged owing to the heavy 
reliance on bank lending in the euro area.
151 Digital technologies 
have
 some particular characteristics that make them 
conducive to higher concentration.
 The increasing importance of intangible capi
tal, 
which
 implies 
substantial fixed costs but
 low marginal costs, together with the ability to 
use cloud computing as a way of r
apidly increasing the size of a company at low cost, 
means companies are able to ach
ieve ﬁscale without massﬂ and
 reproduce business 
processes 
at zero cost 
(Brynjolfsson e
t al.
152). Even outside the technology sector, 
superstar firms
 with low mark
-ups, espec
ially in retail, are very intensive users of ICT 
(Decker et al.
153), employing 
advanced au
tomation technologies for warehousing and 
logistics
. Many digital technologies are also associated wi
th substantial network 
effects, so
 early movers
 have
 a siz
eable adv
antag
e and dominate their markets.
 The 
high 
business dynamism associated with ICT firms in the 1990s (which pulled th
e entire US economy upwards) gave way
 to muted dynamism and a lower start
-up rate 
in the 2000s (Decker et al.
154), itself a potential sign of
 lower competition.
 There are signs of rising
 market power and concentration, particularly in the 
United States
. Although t
here is some debate on the extent of the rise
 of market 
power and the link between mark
-ups and concentration, as firms may keep mark
-ups 
low to attract a large market share, there 
is broad
 agreement that firm mark
-ups and 
concentration ratios have increased in the United States
 (De Loecker et al.

 1  Online platforms and the collaborative economy
 Prepared by Lara Vivian
 The collaborative or sharing economy relies on digital platforms
 to coordinate and supervise the 
matching between the supply and demand sides of the market.
 Online
 platforms tend to be 
heterogeneous in a number of 
respects, including the technology adopted and the services or goods 
provided. For instance, trading media
ted by digital platforms includes 
transport, 
food delivery
 and cleaning services, 
as well as
 online tasks such as translations, transcriptions, data collection, and 
software development. 
In the area of finance
, the collaborative economy
 allows the coordina
tion of 
investors and borrowers 
and the organisation of collective 
project 
financing (crowdfunding), while 
platforms operating in the accommodation sector facilitate access to property. 
The definition of the 
collaborative
 economy includes financial service
s, goods trading
 and encompasses the concept of
 the ﬁ
gig
 economy
ﬂ, which is often used to single out platforms where the service provided is the paid 
labour necessary to complete a task or solve a problem.
162 Although the collaborative economy is not a new p
henomenon, its size is increasing.
 According to 
estimates, 
although 
the size of online platforms has 
grown 
rapidly, their contribution to the economy 
                                                                    157  See the section entitled ﬁSupply sideﬂ in Anderton, R. et al., op. cit., and references therein, for a broader

 The
 digital economy and the euro area
  137 remains relatively small. In 2016 they accounted for up to 1% of GDP and 3% of employment across 
EU countr
ies
, but with considerable cross
-country heterogeneity
 (see Chart A)
. 
In terms of 
specialisation, 
financial sector platforms generate most of the revenues of the 
collaborative
 economy 
in 
Czech Republic, 
Estonia, Latvia
 and Sweden, while the online skills s
ector 
leads
 in Poland and 
Luxembourg. 
Meanwhile, for countries with smaller platform economies, the accommodation sector 
plays a larger role. 
Similarly to the size of the 
collaborative
 economy, platform employment has 
increased over time
 and accounted for
 0.15% of overall 
employment in 2016 in the EU27 and the 
United Kingdom taken together.
163 Although surveys and studies often rely on different definitions of

 Online platforms have the potential to be a significant source of innovation and competition, mainly by 
lowering the barriers to starting and operating small businesses.
 It is 
nevertheless 
important to make 
sure that di
fferences in rules and regulations between platform and standard providers do not result in 
an uneven playing field. In addition, the relevance of large networks in the development of online 
platforms increases the risk of 
substantial
 disparities in market
 shares between big platform players 
and others. Therefore, policy questions arise 
in terms of
 how to promote fair competition and how to 
avoid the possible emergence of dominant platforms. This might require revising the legal framework 
in which they oper
ate, including adapting taxation and monitoring mergers and acquisitions. Similarly, 
there are 
legal questions 
regarding
 the employment status of platform workers and whether online

 The
 digital e
conomy and the euro area
  138 platforms should be considered as employers,
 with the results of related c
ourt cases so far mixed.
165 In addition, digital platforms need to ensure 
the 
application of 
principles such as transparency and 
non-discrimination in their 
business models, which rely heavily on the use of data and data 
processing
.  4 Labour markets
 This se
ction reviews the effects of digitalisation on the labour market.
 It starts 
with a discussion on the phenomenon of job polarisation
 and then considers how 
digitalisation and 
automation may 
lead to the 
replace
ment, but also creation, of
 some 
jobs and tasks.
166 From the early 1990s
, labour markets in advanced economies started to 
polarise
, whereby the share of low and high
-skilled jobs increased at the 
expense of middle
-skilled jobs
. While employment and wage premiums for high 
skills rose, there was also a subs
tantial increase in the employment share of 
low
-skilled labour, albeit not always necessarily accompanied by rising wages. The 
increase in employment shares for high
- and low
-skilled workers therefore 
corresponded to a reduction in the share for middle
-skilled employment, giving rise to 
job polarisation (or ﬁhollowing outﬂ), a phenomenon identified in virtually all advanced 
economies.
167 The principal explanation for polarisation is that the rise of digitalisation 
and automation has given rise to routine
-bias
ed technological change (RBTC); jobs 
characterised by a high content of routine and repetitive tasks (middle
-skilled jobs, 
such as bank tellers, machine operators, office clerks) can eventually be performed 
more efficiently by machines or computers.
168 Automation tend
s to favour skills at both high and low wages.
 On the one hand, 
RBTC favours jobs that require complex analytical skills with a certain level of 
abstraction (and hence limited automation potential) or a high level of interpersonal 
communicati
on, which are naturally complemented by such technologies. On the 
other hand, automation and RBTC have not yet affected non
-routine manual jobs, 
which typically require little to no specialised education but have a large content of 
tasks that require intui
tion, discretion, flexibility, adaptability or interpersonal 
interaction, which are also hard to automate. This category encompasses a very broad 
array of jobs mostly found in the service sector, such as cleaning, maintenance, 
personal care, security and f
ood services.
                                                                     165  For a detailed discussion on the employment and working conditions of platform workers in selected EU 
countries, see de Groen, W.P. et al., op. cit.

high enough element of repetition that it can be readily codified

 The
 digital economy and the euro area
  139 Automation and its impacts on different types of jobs can be analysed through 
the lens of a 
framework
 that
 views
 jobs as collections of different tasks, some 
of which are more 
readily automated
 than others
. In this framework,
 RBTC 
automates s
ome tasks and creates new ones, destroying some existing jobs and 
creating new ones in the process.
169 Given that automation has a comparative 
advantage in middle
-skilled tasks (routine
-intensive with functions that can be 
relatively easily translated into c
omputer code), automation can replace these jobs 
and middle
-skilled workers shift away from these tasks.
170 The evolution of job polarisation by task content 
for selected European 
countries 
is shown in
 Chart 4.
171 Non
-routine cognitive tasks are split into ana
lytical 
and personal (e.g. mathematicians and managers), routine tasks are split into 
cognitive and manual (e.g. clerks and machine operators), and non
-routine manual 
tasks are split into physical and personal (e.g. cleaners and waiters). The chart shows 
the evolution of the task content of the mean job
172 and reveals the sharp reduction in 
its routine content and a corresponding increase in its non
-routine cognitive content. 
The picture emerging from this chart is consistent with the view of polarisation as
 accompanied by 
a changing allocation 
of skills across occupations
.173 Furthermore, 
Dias da Silva et al.
174 find that declines in average hours worked over recent decades 
across a selection of EU countries have exacerbated job polarisation.
175                                                                     169  The tasks framework is based on that of

 173  See 
Acemoglu, D. and Autor, D.
, op. cit. Also, the precise nature of the effects on labour depends on the 
equilibrium interaction of 
technology, skills supply, and consumer demand. As workers abandon middling 
tasks for low and high
-skilled tasks, then the effects on employment and wages in these groups will 
depend on the relative comparative advantages of the middling workers in these t
asks.

 175  In more detail, Dias da Silva et al., op. cit., find that hours worked have fallen more for some routine jobs

arisation at the top and middle parts of the skill distribution.

resent a prominent example

small shift in favour of high

with employment.

2  Digitalisation, employment and u

 Prepared by Valerie Jarvis
 Measuring the reach of the digital economy is not straightforward, but a metric for gauging the degree 
of digitalisation across EU countries is the extent to which employment is related to digital activities.

Such a measure 
demonstrates the high degree of 
cross

of total ICT

22% in Luxembourg (surpassing even that of 
the United States) to around 7% in Greece,

-dependent employment 
amounts to roughly 17% of total employment
 in Sweden and Estonia
, similar to the 
share
 seen in the United States.
178 Sectors with higher digital intensity made substantial contributions to employment growth across 
advanced economies during the decade 2006
-16 (see 
Chart A

). Looking at the 
relationship between total employment 
growth and the contribution of the digital

 Chart 
A (left

 suggests a strong contribution from 
digitally
-intensive sectors to total employment growth between 
2006-16. More 
heavily 
digitally 
dependent countries, i.e. Sweden and Estonia, appear to have been among the strongest performers 
in terms of the employment contribution of the digital
-intensive sectors, outperforming many other EU 
economies.
 Moreover, there is some evidence to suggest that ec
onomies with a higher digital economy share of 
total value
 added tend to be those with lower unemployment rates. 
Chart 
A (right
-hand panel)
 shows 
a broadly negative correlation
 between aggregate unemployment rates and the shares of total value 
added accoun
ted for by digital sectors
 for
 the EU economies and the United States over the 
period 
2000-18. Although the chart does not imply causa
lity
, it seems to 
counter
 the notion that a higher 
degree of digitalisation 
leads
 to higher 
aggregate 
unemployment.
 That i
s not to say that d
igitalisation 
does not result in 
job displacement and job disruption, whereby some workers lose jobs and find it 
difficult to get back into employment for prolonged periods, but 
digitalisation

 The
 digital economy and the euro area
  142 destroys others. They argue for a reinterpretation of the relationship betw
een technology and labour as a ﬁrace between automation and new labour
-intensive 
tasksﬂ, which reinstates labour and increases productivity. At the same time, these 
mechanisms may lead to greater inequality in the labour market.
180 In addition, the 
higher market power of large digital firms may also compress wages and be 
associated with a lower labour share.
181 Recent work has attempted to quantify the threat of automation to 
existing
 jobs
 more precisely.
 Frey and Osborne
182 asked exper
ts to give subjective views on 
whether specific occupations could be easily automated in the near future.
183 The 
results suggest that 47% of jobs in the United States are at a high risk (over 70%) of 
automation. Subsequent studies find smaller possible effec
ts, such as Arntz et al.
184, 
who estimate that only 9% of jobs in the United States face a high risk of automation. 
Overall, there is wide variation in the empirical estimates of how many jobs are at risk 
of some degree of automation. In addition, although a
utomation seems to be related to 
trends such as job polarisation and may imply some job losses, automation also leads 
to ﬁreinstatement effectsﬂ resulting in new tasks and job creation.
185 Precise numbers aside, there 
is 
undoubtedly a concern that task autom
ation 
threaten
s a substantial number of jobs.
 Even though technology has had a positive 
net effect on labour historically, there is a risk that the pace of automation may be too 
fast for some workers, who will not be able to quickly reskill and be redeploy
ed to new 
tasks. While education and retraining policies have an important role to play, they may 
be more challenging for more mature workers. Structural framework conditions, 
including both labour and product market policies, may need to be further adapte
d to 
fully reap the potential gains from digitalisation while maintaining inclusiveness.
 5 Digitalisation and 
consumer price inflation
 Digitalisation is often associated with a negative impact on the price of some 
goods and services and on overall inflatio
n. This impact can be examined 
separately by distinguishing two transmission channels. The first is the direct 
                                                                    180  See, for example, the section en
titled ﬁA general equilibrium perspective of how automation affects the 
labour marketﬂ in Anderton, R. et al., op. cit. Here, the impacts of an automation shock using a dynamic 
stochastic general equilibrium model show an increase in both low
- and high
-skilled jobs in the medium 
term, while increasing the wage premium of high
-skilled workers relative to low
-skilled ones.
 181  There is also some evidence that the large increase in teleworking during the COVID
-19 pandemic may 
be associated with a further rise i
n inequality as jobs that can be performed remotely are often associated 
with higher wages (see the article entitled ﬁThe impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on the euro area 
labour marketﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin).

smission channel is more 
indirect. It captures digitalisation, i.e. online retail, effects on inflation as 
cost saving
s, 
higher price transparency
, intensified competition, 
and productivity gains 
Œ which are
 generally very difficult to disentangle empirica
lly.
186 Finally, it is important to 
distinguish the impact of digitalisation on price level from the rate of change, i.e. 
inflation, and to examine if there is a bias in measuring inflation using the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) given the incre
asing importance of online retail for 
household consumption.
 The direct effects
 The direct impact channel of digitalisation on consumer prices 
functions
 via the 
prices of digital products purchased by consumers.
 Because such products are 
part of the HICP f
or the euro area and its member countries, this will have a direct 
impact on inflation as measured by
 this index
. 
It is difficult to clearly define what digital 
product
s are, but a proxy for an index of ﬁdigital productsﬂ can be constructed following 
the d
efinition of an ICT index by Eurostat
.187 According to that proxy, d
eclines in the 
prices of ICT products lowered the euro area annual HICP inflation rate by 0.15 
percentage points on average each year in the period from 2002 to 2019
 (see Chart 
5). The impac
t was larger until around 2015 but decreased to some extent
 afterwards. 
Over the same period, the range of impacts for
 individual euro area countries
 was
 around 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per year
 on average

 ICT product contribution to headline

 (percentage points)
  Sources: Eurostat, ECB calculations.
 Notes: 
The l
atest data refer to 
July
 2020. The range 
is defined by the minimum and maximum across the euro area countries (in 
changing 
composition)
. The ICT products comprise audiovisual, photographic and information processing equipment
, telephone and 
telefax equipment and services
, as well as clocks and watches. The country price indices for clocks and watches have different starting 
months, but the weight is very small (for the euro area it is less than 0.5% of headline HICP), therefore the comparison across
 countries 
and time is not distorted (the impact on the aggregate ICT product contribution is negligible)
. Inflation rates for 2000
 and 2001 are 
distorted as they reflect the methodological impact of the inclusion of inter
net services in Germany™s HICP.
 A number of caveats surround the estimates of the inflation rate for digital 
items.
 First, digital products in the consumer basket do
 not comprise only the 
four
 categories used for the reported index. 
Many other goods and services are also 
exposed to ICT developments
 to various degrees. 
Second, ICT products (or electronic 
goods) are subject to sudden and very fast technological upgrades
 and thus create 
challenges for 
their 
inclusion in the HICP basket in terms of proper quality adjustment, 
replacement or expansion of the basket. Failure to appropriately incorporate 
the prices 
of 
such products in the HICP basket can lead to a bias (upward
 or downward) in the 
respective price indices.
 The indirect effects
 The indirect impact channels of digitalisation operate via cost savings and 
higher competition owing to increased price transparency.
 Digitalisation in th
e context 
of prices for final cons
umer goods is
 often associated with 
the
 narrower term 
ﬁe-commerceﬂ, which is typically used to describe

Considering e

growing
 e-commerce 
occurs
 in two ways. 
First, e
-commerce 
can reduce 
cost
s compared with the standard offline distribution 
channels 
(e.g. online sales require lower expenditures than maintaining shops), which 
both traditional and online retailers may pass on to 
consumers
. Second, e
-commerce 
may lower prices (or constrain their increase following cost rises) 
because of
 higher 
transparen
cy and intensified competition between suppliers
. Customers

for lower prices and bargains

erod
ing their
 profit margins. 
Both effects can 
take place
 when the 
share o
f e
-commerce retail in total 
retail trade 
is still low.
 Although e
-commerce generally intensifies competition, the presence and wide 
use of 
internet
-based trade technologies may also create opportunities for tacit 
collusion among suppliers or retailers, wh
ich may impair competition.
 While
 e-commerce 
enables consumers 
to compare
 the
 prices and qualit
y of goods, it also 
facilitates opportunities for suppliers to check prices and possibly collude on pricing 
behaviour. 
Although
 such effects may be relevant for 
specific markets, the 
competition
-enhancing impacts of e
-commerce
 transaction technologies should 
dominate 
Œ notably as long as the technology is still relatively young and as long as 
online suppliers strive for market share in an effort to strengthen 
thei
r position in the 
business.
 The extent to which the indirect effects described above have an impact on 
inflation partly depends on the prevalence of e
-commerce in the euro area.
 Moreover
, the opportunity to compare prices online may already be a 
competitio
n-enhancing factor.
 Online sales to consumers comprised 
almost
 14% of 
total retail sales (excluding cars and motorcycles) in the euro area in 2017
 Œ a share 
that has almost doubled over the last ten years. The m
ost frequently purchased 
items 
were 
clothing,
 accommodation and travel
.189 Consumers have also significantly 
increased their use of e
-commerce. In 2019 t
he share of people using the internet to 
obtain information about goods and services 
reached 70%, with
 60% using it to buy 
them 
Œ a significant increa
se over the last ten years 
(see
 Chart 6
). A
mong euro area 
countries, Germany and the Netherlands take the lead, followed by Luxembourg and 
France, with southern economies (Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal) 
somewhat 
lagging behind
 for actual purchases
.                                                                     189  The estimate for the share of online retail sales is obtained from country level business

 To the extent that e
-commerce adoption continues to increase, it could impact 
inflation for a protracted period.
 The e
mpirical evidence on the effects of 
e-commerce penetration on inflation so far is scarce but points to a small negative 
effect.
 A number of studies, including internal ECB estimates, have used different 
approaches, compositions of countries (including euro
 area countries) and time 
periods (including the past ten years), and found that expansion of e
-commerce 
(measured by various metrics) may have lowered the annual inflation rate by around 
0.1 percentage points or.

 The
 digital economy and the euro area
  147 e-commerce technologies through markets has 
levelled off.
191 Despite widespread 
agreement that online retail likely dampens inflation, a smaller strand of lite
rature 
argues that t
he adoption of digital technologies may be associated with market 
concentration 
among
 a handful of superstar firms
, which may result in some 
inflationary effects in the longer run 
Œ an aspect to be monitored in the future
.192 Changes in
 market power and digitalisation in general 
may have implications 
not only for inflation but also for
 the 
transmission
 of monetary 
policy.
 However, 
the academic discussion on the channels of this impact is still open. 
Syverson
193 shows that a monetary expansio
n would lead to a larger output expansion 
under conditions of perfect com
petition than it would under a monopoly.
 Monetary policy 
affects firms 
directly 
by changing their cost of capital
 and indirectly by affecting 
demand. C
ompanies with high market power in general respond less to changes in 
costs, and hence to monetary policy, than perfectly competitive firms. This does not 
mean, however, that less market power will 
necessarily 
result in 
a higher pass
-through 
of cost shocks
 or 
higher 
transmission of monetary policy
. The transmission of 
monetary policy
 will depend on how the 
pricing decisions
 of firms c
hange as market 
power changes.
194 Korinek and Ng
195 analyse the role
 of digital innovation costs of
 superstar firms 
and find that
, as innovation proceeds, factor costs will fluctuate less 
with demand, leading to a flatter Phillips Curve
, i.e. more price stickiness
.196 A somewhat contrasting finding is reported by 
Cavallo
197, who
 finds a decline in the 
degree of geographic price dispersi
on in the United States over the last ten years, 
which he 
attribute
s to the fact that online retailers have uniform pricing strategies 
limit
ing
 the opportunity for geographical price discrimination. As a result, the sensitivity 
of retail prices to global s
hocks, such a
s exchange rates and gas prices,
 has 
increased,
 which
 suggest
s a decline 
rather than an increase 
in price stickiness.
198 Overall, the impact of digitalisation on monetary policy needs further research, both to 
enrich structural models to capture
 its effects and to verify their empirical 
implications
.199                                                                     191  See discussion by

retailers, can reduce price stickiness.

 The
 digital economy and the euro area
  148 Online retail and measurement of the HICP
 Last but not least i
t is important to distinguish the impact of digitalisation on 
price level
s from 
its impact
 on inflation.
 The inclusion 
of 
goods and serv
ices traded 
online in the HICP will have an impact on HICP
 inflation
 only if the prices of such 
products and services change at different rates 
than
 the prices of goods and services 
traded offline. 
The methodology for compiling the HICP implies that 
price
-level 
differences between online and offline shop prices
 do not
 have 
a direct effect on the 
HICP. 
At the same time, i
ncreasing expenditure via the internet is reflected in 
adjustments to the weights of the respective HICP sub
-items
. Moreover, the s
tatistic
al 
offices of the euro area countries continuously enhance their data collection methods 
and some online prices are already reflected in the HICP.
200 The available evidence on possible measurement error in the consumer price 
indices resulting from the 
incomplete incorporation of online sales is scarce 
and inconclusive.
 While there is broad agreement in the literature that 
the frequency 
of price adjustment has 
increased
 over
 recent years
 in both retail channels, some 
studies document 
prices 
in online and
 brick
-and-mortar shops chang
ing
 with a similar 
frequency
, whereas others find that price changes are more frequent for online 
stores.
201 The evidence on the average size of price changes is similarly 
inconclusive.
202 Overall
, there is still not enough evidenc
e to conclude that the 
partial 
exclusion of online sales
 leads to
 measurement error 
in price indices (
upward or 
downward
). If a bias does exist, its extent is even more unclear
. Policymakers should monitor and analyse the impact of digitalisation on 
consum
er prices and inflation.
 It may have implications for price measurement and 
inflation trends as well as for the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
203 6 Digitalisation and the COVID
-19 pandemic
 Since
 the onset of the pandemic there has been an increase i
n the take
-up of 
digital technologies, especially in connection with lockdowns restricting 
physical mobility within and across regions and countries.
 The increase in

accommodation services, the statistical office in the Netherlands collects data on prices for clothing, and 
the German statist
ical office collects data on prices for long

ﬂ. The increase in digital take
-up seems to be a result
 of both existing users who 
expand their usage as well as new users and uses,
 as more households resort to 
online services and more businesses to digitally
-enabled conferencing and 
supply
-chaining, for example, thereby also triggering an increase in digita
l literacy and 
skills. This may be an important step towards a larger digital economy in the euro area 
and EU; whether this represents a permanent change will be a key factor for the likely 
medium to long
-term impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on the digital
 and broader 
economy in the euro area, EU and elsewhere.
 As t
he COVID
-19 pandemic is still unfolding, its impact on the digital economy 
remains uncertain, especially beyond the short term
. Its
 impact on the digital and 
broader economy depends both on digital supply and demand. 
The supply response 
would enhance productivity, ICT and possibly human capital and thereby boost 
capacity and potential, while the demand response would do so only if it 
were more 
permanent. Overall, it seems that the euro area and EU economies have a greater 
chance of catching up with their peers in the global digital economy if a strong digital 
supply
-side response materialises.

 digital economy and the euro area
  150 7 Conclusion
 The 
digitalisation revolution
 is ﬁvirtually everywhereﬂ and is transforming all 
our economies
. The digital economy is 
increasing 
in 
importance
, with a likely 
acceleration in the take
-up of digital technologies 
during 
the 
COVID
-19 pandemic
, and 
is affecting monetary policy
-relevant 
variables such as employment, productivity and 
inflation. There is considerable heterogeneity across the euro area and Europe in 
terms of the adoption of digital technologies and most of these countries are falling 
behind major competitors such as the Unit
ed States. Structural policies, such as 
labour, product and financial market regulations, may have to be adapted in order to 
fully reap the potential gains from digital technologies while maintaining inclusiveness. 
In terms of digitalisation, the COVID
-19 pandemic may create further challenges for 
EU countries, but it also provides important opportunities to catch up.

1) Where annual and quarterly Labour Force Survey data have not yet been published, annual and quarterly data are derived as simple averages of the monthly data. Owing to technicalissues with the introduction of the new German system of integrated household surveys, including the Labour Force Survey, the figures for the euro area include data from Germany,
starting in Q1 2020, which are not direct estimates from Labour Force Survey microdata, but based on a larger sample including data from other integrated household surveys.2) Not seasonally adjusted.
3) The job vacancy rate is equal to the number of job vacancies divided by the sum of the number of occupied posts and the number of job vacancies, expressed as a percentage.Data are non-seasonally adjusted and cover industry, construction and services (excluding households as employers and extra-territorial organisations and bodies).3.5 Short-term business statistics          Industrial productionCon-ECB indicator   Retail salesNew
