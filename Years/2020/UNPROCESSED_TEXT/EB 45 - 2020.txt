Update 
on economic and monetary 
developments
 
Summary
 
Incoming information since the last monetary policy meeting in early June signals a 
resumption of euro area economic activity, although the level of activity remains well 
below the levels prevailing before the 
coronavirus (COVID
-
19) pandemic and the 
outlook remains highly uncertain. Headline inflation is being dampened by lower 
energy prices and price pressures are expected to remain very subdued on account of 
the sharp decline in real GDP growth and the associa
ted significant increase in 

through to the euro area economy, providing crucial support to the recovery and 
helping to offset the pandemic
-
related downward shift in the proje
cted path of inflation. 
At the same time, the outlook is surrounded by high uncertainty and subject to 
downside risks. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to leave the 
overall monetary policy stance unchanged and to reconfirm the full se
t of its existing 
monetary policy measures.
 
While containment policies have been eased across the world, the global recovery 
remains uneven, uncertain and incomplete. Survey data suggest that the 
unprecedented contraction in the global economy in the first
 
half of 2020 has been 
bottoming out, while cautious consumer behaviour points to sluggish growth 
momentum ahead. While the recovery is proceeding in China, the outlook remains 
highly uncertain in the United States, although there have been some positive d
ata 
surprises. In the United Kingdom and Japan, indicators also point to a bottoming
-
out of 
the contraction in some sectors, but activity levels remain very weak. In this context, 
global inflation remains subdued.
 
Over the review period, the forward curve 
of the euro overnight index average 
(EONIA) shifted slightly downwards and a mild inversion appeared at short maturities, 
albeit without expectations of an imminent cut in policy rates. Long
-
term euro area 
sovereign bond yields also declined on account of 
lower risk
-
free rates and sovereign 
spreads recorded a slight compression. Equities continued to recover from the troughs 
reached in March and, despite compressing further, corporate bond spreads are still 
wider than they were in late February. In foreign 
exchange markets, the euro 
strengthened slightly in trade
-
weighted terms.
 
Incoming data and survey results suggest that economic activity improved significantly 
in May and June from its trough in April, alongside the ongoing containment of the 
virus and th
e associated easing of the lockdown measures. At the same time, 
economic indicators remain well below the levels recorded before the pandemic, and 
the recovery is in its early stages and remains uneven across sectors and jurisdictions. 
After decreasing by 
3.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2020, euro area real 
GDP is expected to have contracted even further overall in the second quarter, broadly

in line with the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. Signs of a 
recovery in cons
umption have emerged, while there has also been a significant 
rebound in industrial output. At the same time, subdued labour market conditions and 
precautionary household saving are weighing on consumer spending. Weak business 
prospects and high uncertaint
y are dampening investment, while the weakness in the 
global economy is hampering foreign demand for euro area goods and services.
 

0.1% in May to 0.3% in June, mainly re
flecting less negative energy price inflation. On 
the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary 
reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation is expected to decline again in the 
coming months before rebounding
 
in early 2021. Over the medium term, weaker 
demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by 
upward pressures related to supply constraints. Market
-
based indicators of 
longer
-
term inflation expectations have remained 
at subdued levels.
 
Since March 2020 the coronavirus pandemic has caused monetary dynamics to 


precau
tionary grounds. In May domestic credit remained the main source of money 
creation, which was driven in particular by loans to non
-
financial corporations and the 

programmes. The J
uly 2020 euro area bank lending survey shows a continued 

liquidity needs. At the same time, credit standards for loans to firms have remained 
favourable, supported by fiscal 
and monetary measures. In addition, very favourable 
lending rates, which point to an ongoing robust transmission of monetary policy 
measures, are supporting euro area economic growth.
 
Against this background, ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to su
pport the 
economic recovery and to safeguard medium
-
term price stability. Therefore, the 
Governing Council decided to reconfirm its very accommodative monetary policy 
stance.
 
The Governing Council will keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. They are 
ex
pected to remain at their present or lower levels until the inflation outlook has 
robustly converged to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within the projection 
horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation
 
dynamics.
 
The Governing Council will continue its purchases under the pandemic emergency 

contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset 
the 
pandemic
-
related downward shift in the projected path of inflation. The purchases will 
continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and 
among jurisdictions. This allows the Governing Council to effectively stave off ris
ks to 
the smooth transmission of monetary policy. The Governing Council will conduct net 
asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, 
until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. The Governing Council w
ill

reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP 
until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll
-
off of the PEPP portfolio will 
be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
 
Net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly 

temporary envelope until the end of the year. The Governing Council continues to 
expect mon
thly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to 
reinforce the accommodative impact of the policy rates, and to end shortly before it 
starts raising the key ECB interest rates. The Governing Council intends to continue 
reinvesting,
 
in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under 
the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB 
interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity 
cond
itions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
 
The Governing Council will also continue to provide ample liquidity through its 
refinancing operations. In particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted 
longer
-
term refinancing operat
ions (TLTRO III) has registered a very high take
-
up of 
funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households.
 
The monetary policy measures that the Governing Council has taken since early 
March are providing crucial support to underpin the recovery of the
 
euro area 
economy and to safeguard medium
-
term price stability. In particular, they support 
liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to 
households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing con
ditions 
for all sectors and jurisdictions. In addition, the European Commission has recently 
published some guidelines for government guarantee schemes in order to avoid 
potential cliff effects during their phasing
-
out. At the same time, in the current 
env
ironment of elevated uncertainty and significant economic slack, the Governing 
Council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to 
support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. This 
applies f
irst and foremost to its role in ensuring that monetary policy is transmitted to 
all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of its price stability 
mandate. The Governing Council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of 
it
s instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a 
sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

External environment
 
While containment policies have eased across the world, the global recovery 
remains uneven,
 
uncertain and incomplete
.
 
The global outlook remains dominated 
by the evolution of the coronavirus (COVID
-
19) pandemic. The number of new cases 
continues to rise globally, particularly in the United States and Latin America, as well 
as in several other ke
y emerging market economies (e.g. India and South Africa). At 
the same time, indicators of 
effective lockdown
 
measures, which reflect
 
official policies 
wit
h actual mobility data, suggest
 
a steady
 
and gradual opening up in most economies 
since end
-
May. 
This
 
combination of the easing of containment measures and the 
increase in new COVID
-
19 
cases 
in many countries renders 
the 
global 
recovery 
highly 
uncertain
.
 
Survey data suggest that 
t
he 
unprecedented 
contraction in the global economy 
in the first half of 2020
 
has been bottoming
 
out
.
 
The global 
composite output 

PMI

excluding the euro area 

 
continued to rebound 
from its April trough in June, reaching

(see Chart 1). 
The increase in June was 
broad
-
based across all sub
-
component
s; the services sector, which had been lagging 
behind the manufacturing sector in terms of improvement, recovered strongly
. The
se
 
developments were 
also 
broad
-
based across almost all major advanced and 
e
merging economies. However, PMIs for everywhere excep
t China have remained
 
in 
contractionary territory
 
below 50, thereby pointing to continued weak activity levels 
globally.

High

Global 
inflation slowed further 
in 
May
.
 
Annual consumer price inflation in the 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co
-
operation and Development (OECD) 
declined to 0.7
% in 
May,
 
driven by a faster decline in energy prices, while food price 
inflation increase
d slightly. Meanwhile, i
nflation excluding food and energy 
remained 
stable at 1.6
%
.
 
The slowdown in inflation was broad
-
based across most advanced 
economies a
nd
 
major non
-
OECD emerging market economies
. 
Looking ahead, global 
inflationary pressures are expe
cted to 
remain subdued
 
as a result of both
 
the fall in oil 
prices
 
and weak demand
.
 
Oil prices have increased by more than 10% since the last Governing Council 
meeting amid a rebound in economic activity and falling supply 
owing
 
to cuts 
agreed in early May
.
 
Oil prices have been supported by a stronger than expected 
pick
-
up in oil demand on the back of the easing of lockdown measures. Oil demand is 
expected to remain subdued in 
the second half of 
2020 and 
into 
2021
,
 
with 
consumption set to remain below the le
vels seen in 2019. However, oil demand 
estimates have been revised up
wards
 
recently following the easing of lockdown 
measures in a number of countries. Besides recovering demand, reductions in supply 
have also 
been a factor in the
 
rebalancing 
of
 
oil market
s. In particular, the 
recovery in 
prices has been supported by the 
OPEC+ agreement (i.e. the 
pact
 
between major oil 
producers) in early May to lower supply by almost 10 m
illion 
b
arrels 
p
er 
d
ay (mbpd),
 
and 
by 
significant shut

ins of oil production in the U
n
ited 
S
tates
. 
M
etal prices have 
also 
recovered strongly since mid
-
April
, with
 
an increase 
of
 
around 2% since the last 
Governing Council
 
meeting.

US data have recently
 
surprised 
on the upside, but the 
level of activity
 
remains 
weak.
 
With lockdowns being 
gradually 
lifted, economic activity has resumed and 
various economic indicators 
have 
turned 
to the 
up
side
. Retail sales and food services 
rebounded sharply in May as household spend
ing benefited from federal 
stimulus 
payments, reinforced by the return to w
ork 
of
 
some employees. Industrial producti
on 
also rose in May
, albeit less strongly. 
Labour market data also surprised on the upside. 
In May and June, the 
U
nited 
S
tates added
 
7.5
 
million jobs
,
 
regaining
 
about 
one
-
third
 
of 
the jobs lost since February. Whil
e the June figures showed the largest increase in 
history, labour market data 
currently 
require a cautious interpretation
, as they 
are 
based on a mid
-
month survey and do not 
yet 
reflect newly reinforced regional 
lockdown measures. In spite of the further 
f
all
 
in
 
the unemployment rate by 2.2 
percentage points,
 
to 11.1%, 
labour market 
slack remains at histori
cally high levels
. 
Overall, 
t
he latest data 
seem to confirm
 
the bottoming out 
of the US economy 
indicated by
 
other variables
,
 
rather than pointing 
to a s
ubstantial improvement 
in
 
the 
economic 
situation
. Key US indicators remain
 
well below pre
-
pandemic levels, 
and
 
rising
 
numbers of
 
new infections may trigger renewed containment measures
 
or slow 
the easing of existing ones
, 
thereby increasing the risk that
 
the 
recovery
 
will be 
undermined
.
 
In Japan, the pace of economic activity has started normalising as containment 
measures were progressively lifted in May
.
 
Following a contraction
 
of 0.6%
 
in real 
G
DP in the first quarter,
 
the intensification of containment 
efforts in Japan triggered 
a 
considerable 
retrenchment
 
in industrial production, external trade and private 
consumption
 
in April and May
. The latest Tankan survey confirmed 
a
 
marked 
deterioration in business sentiment in manufacturing and services in the 
s
econd
 
quarter. Moreover, it also signalled a
 
sharp cut in the investment plans of small firms
, 
which 
continu
ed 
to take a
 
cautious 
view 
regarding the outlook.
 
In its latest meeting
,
 
the 
B
ank 
o
f 
J
apan
 
announced an increase in the size of its special program
m
e
 
to support 
corporate financing to JPY 110 trillion (from JPY 75 trillion). This program
me
 
includes 
purchases of commer
cial paper and corporate bonds, 
as well as special lending 
operations. The recent measures coincided with a marked acceleration in lendi
ng 
growth in April and May, likely reflecting an accommodative lending stance by banks 
and a higher demand for operating funds by Japanese firms. The government has also 
provided significant stimulus, approving two supplementary budgets for 
the 
202
0 fiscal
 
year, amounting to about 10% of GDP.
 
In the United Kingdom, an u
nprecedented decline in activity 
is 
expected in the 
second quarter
 
with activity resuming only slowly amid the easing of 
containment measures.
 
Real GDP 
increased
 
by
 
1.8
% m
onth
-
o
n
-
m
onth
 
in 
May
 
but 
fell by 19.1% on a three
-
month rolling average basis amid stringent lockdown 
measures
. The composite PMI output 
index 
remained below 50 throug
hout the 
second quarter, 
suggest
ing
 
an
 
ongoing weakness in demand, with further reductions 
in new orders and 
new export orders for the fourth month in a row. 
P
rospects for a swift 
turnaround in the third quarter remain 
slim
. 
Although t
he reopening of leisure and 
travel facilities at the beginning of July 
is helping to boost activity, 
business and 
consumer sentime
nt 
remains
 
low compared to pre
-
lockdown levels. The shape of the 
recovery will also depend on the roadmap for 
future 
policy support. UK monetary 
policy remains supportive, 
but f
iscal policy support is likely to be less substantial

compared to the first hal
f of the year
, notwithstanding the additional fiscal stimulus 
announced in July.
 
The recovery in China is proceeding despite weak external demand
.
 
Amid 
the 
easing 
of 
containment measures, high
-
frequency indicators point to a continued 
normalisation of acti
vi
ty in June
. In terms of hard data, industrial production 
growth 
turned positive in 
April
 
and gained further momentum in 
May (
up 
4.4% y
ear
-
o
n
-
y
ear
). 
While retai
l sales continue to decline on an annual basis
, sequential growth 
momentum has been positive. P
MI data paint a similar (albeit uneven) picture, with 
manufacturing 
having 
already return
ed
 
to expansionary territory in March, while 
weaker new export orders are restraining the momentum of the upturn
.
 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Chinese authorities have 
provided addi
tional 
fiscal and monetary stimulus to 
cushion the economic shock. Fiscal policy is aiming to stabilise employment and 
economic growth by expanding unemployment insurance, investment and tax relief. 
Fiscal policies are 
being 
complemented by monetary polici
es designed to ensure 
sufficient liquidity in the banking system
,

key policy rates and reserve 
requirements
, and directions for
 
banks to accommodat

A

growth of 0.

% in the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 2019 
(see Chart

The breakdown suggests 
that the fall in GDP in the first quarter of 2020 was driven by both d
omestic demand
 
(which made a 
-
3.5 percentage 
point contribution to growth)
 
and net trade (
-
0.4 
percentage points), while c
hanges in inventories
 
provided a small positive contribution 
to growth (+0.3 percentage points). E
conomic indicators
 
suggest that the decline in 
economic activity owing to the COVID
-
19 pandemic reached a trough in April 2020. 
Survey information, high
-
frequency indicators and hard data suggest that a recovery 
which is broad
-
based, but slow and uneven across countries, is
 
taking place
 
as the 
economy gradually reopens. Survey data point to an improvement in activity in both 
the manufacturing and services sectors in May and June, giving further cause for 
confidence that the recovery will continue in the third quarter.

Clear signs of a recovery in consumption have emerged since May.
 
Available 
indicators 
point to an
 
increase in spendin
g following the

it rose by

and is expected to 
have risen
 
further 
in June. Although still standing 
about 50% below their average monthly lev

car registrations 
surged by 140%

in May 
following 
sharp
 
decline

of

45.8% in April 
and

Consumer confidence

that consumption increased 
strongly 
in May and

with

Consequently, the

high 
level of
 
16.9%
 
in the first

savings. 
U
nlike during the 
g
reat 
f
inancial 
c
risis, the spike in savings 
is
 
mainly 
reflected 
in higher bank deposits, rather than lower credit flows.
 
Some 
pent
-
up demand
 
effects
 
seem likely 
in the period ahead, although their 
size remains highly uncertain
.
 
About half of the contraction in private consumption 
reflects expenditure components which 
can be
 
postpon
ed
 
(e.g. 
purchases of 
electronics
 
and
 
cars). 
This sugg
ests some potential for pent
-
up demand for these 
goods as containment measures are lifted.
 
Pent
-
up demand describes a rapid 
increase in demand for products
 
following a downturn
, 
which 
temporarily exceed
s
 
the 
level
 
of demand that prevailed before the downtu
rn
. As consumers tend to hold off 
making purchases during a recession
 
and, in the current situation, they may have 
been forced to postpone purchases as a result of the lockdowns
, they 
have
 
probably 
buil
t
 
up a backlog of demand that 
could be 
unleashed 
as
 
signs of 
a 
recovery emerge
 
and the containment measures are eased
. While recent retail trade data show a strong 
rebound in a number of product categories, it is too early to 
determine
 
whether this 
reflects widespread pent
-
up demand or rather a shift in co
nsumption baskets (e.g. 
towards purchases of 
bicycles
 
and
 
home office equipment) in response to 
the 
pandemic
. 

 
available up to 
June, 
households continue to expect 
to 
spend less on major purchases 
over
 
the next 
12
 
months 
compared with the
 
previous 
12
 
months, despite the accumulated savings.
 
This suggests that consumers may remain cautious, in part given the higher risk of 
unemployment.
 
The downturn in b
usiness investment 
as a result of the 
lockdowns 
and 
containment measures implemented 
across euro area countries 
since
 
March 
2020
 
is expected to 
have reached a trough in April as signs of a recovery 
emerge.
 
Production data for April and May exhibited a 
dramatic fall in manufacturing 
production and sales
. Thi
s was
 
driven by a combination of 
both 
supply and demand 
factors related to the COVID
-
19 pandemic
 
and had
 
a major
,
 
adverse impact on 
business investment. 
P
roduction of capital goods
, an indicator for non
-
construction 
investment,
 
fell sharply 
in March and Ap
ril, declining 
by 
39
%.
 
The decline in the 
production of transport equipment over the same period was even more severe
,
 
with a 
drop of 
69%
. 
Furthermore, according to the industry survey of the European 
Commission conducted in April, c
apacity utilisation in 
the capital goods sector 
declined in the second quarter by 17 p
ercentage points
 
to 
stand 
slightly below 67%, 
the lowest level in the history of this series.
 
However, recent production and survey 
data indicate that a recovery from these low levels started i
n May and intensified in 
June. Production of capital goods rebounded strongly in May, rising by 25.4%, and the 
production of transport equipment rebounded with an increase of 84%. Despite this, 
production levels remain significantly below the levels seen i
n February. Survey 
indicators also support the emergence of a recovery. The 
E

Economic
 
Sentiment Indicator stabilised in May and recorded the strongest increase 
in the history of the series in June. In addition, manufacturing confidence
 
in the capital 
goods sector has improved steadily since the trough in April. A similar picture is 
provided by the PMI manufacturing indicators. Notwithstanding the improvements in 
these indicators, order book levels in the capital goods sector, in particu
lar for 
exported capital goods,
 
remained at low levels in June 
according to surveys by the 
European Commission
. Furthermore, e

Housing investment in the euro area recorded a dramatic deterioration in the 
first quarter, while po
sitive signs emerged at the end of the second quarter
.
 
Euro area housing investment dropped by 5.8%, quarter on quarter, in the first three 
months of 2020 

 
the worst growth rate since the start of the series in 1995. This bleak 
outcome mainly resulted fro
m t
he 
widespread 
shutdown of construction sites
, 
although it was partly alleviated by the large backlog of construction plans (especially 
in Germany and the Netherlands) and was accompanied by a reduction in transaction 
volumes with only minor effects on h
ouse prices. As containment measures intensified 
in several countries up to the end of April, an even deeper contraction in euro area 
housing investment is expected to have occurred in the second quarter. According to 
the European Commission survey data, c
onstruction firms faced historically high limits 
to production
 
in the second quarter, mainly owing to financial conditions, potentially 
signalling shortages of liquidity, and to other factors, likely related to the effects of 
containment measures on activi
ty. Nevertheless, after bottoming out in April, the euro 
area PMI for construction output showed signs of improvement in May and June
 
amid 
the 
relaxation of 
containment 
measures
, even standing slightly above the 
expansionary threshold in France and Italy. 

assessments of order books point to moderate prospects for a recovery in the housing 

properties show a similar picture.
 
Moreover, the uncertainty caused by the pandemic 
might have even 
greater
 
and longer
-
lasting 
effects on activity, as it could 
encourage
 
households and investors to postpone property 
transactions 
until an effective medical 
solution
 
for COVID
-
19
 
is found.
 
Aft
er extra and intra
-
e
uro area trade 
fell sharply in the first quarter of 2020, 
extra
-
euro area exports and intra
-
euro area trade collapsed
 
in 
April with the 
emergence of
 
new epicentres of the COVID
-
19 pandemic
.
 
The measures adopted 
to contain the pandemic h
ad a strongly adverse impact on both intra and extra
-
euro 
area trade in the first quarter. Extra
-
euro area exports fell significantly more than 
extra
-
euro area imports, resulting in a negative net trade contribution to GDP of 
-
0.4 
percentage points. Intra
-
euro area trade fell sharply in the first quarter driven mainly by 
intermediate goods, owing to disruptions of supply chains, and by capital goods. A
s 
severe 
lockdowns became effective across the euro area
 
in April, nominal intra

euro 
area goods trade coll
apsed
 
further, falling 
by 21.7%

lower domestic demand in the euro area resulted in a fall in extra

euro area nominal 
goods imports, whic

to the U
nited 
S
tates
 
were down by 
32%, to China
 
by
 
11% and to Brazil by 36% 
compared with April 2019
. 
Leading indicators signal that the trough in terms of negative trade growth rates is 
likely to have occurred in Ap
ril. The PMI for e
uro area new export orders rebounded 
from 18.9 in April to 42.5 in June. 
Manufacturing trade, in particular with regard to
 
the 
automotive sector
,
 
recovered partially 
with the reopening of factories
.
 
While travel and 
transportation remain 
the most affected sectors, trade in these sectors is slowly 
recovering as travel restrictions 
are
 
lifted, which is 
also 
visible in a slight increase in 
flight capacity starting from mid
-
June. 
Despite the partial rebound, the recovery in euro 
area trade is 
likely to be uneven and incomplete given the unsynchronised relaxation 
of containment measures in major trading partners and lasting effects on confidence.
 
While i
ncoming economic data, particularly survey results, show 
initial signs of 
a recovery
, 
they st
ill point to a historic contraction in euro area output in the 
second quarter of 2020
.
 
T
he COVID
-
19 outbreak and the associated containment 
measures
 
have had an adverse impact on activity in manufacturing and particularly in 
services via increasing supply 
constraints and rapidly falling demand. 
As regards 
recent
 
survey data, 
the 

Economic Sentiment Indicator
 
and 
the composite output PMI 
both 
posted 
record lows in April. In May and June there 
were strong increases in some indicators, but
 
many remain below their long
-
term 
levels. Both the Economic Sentiment Indicator and the PMI display a broad
-
based 
rebound across both countries and economic sectors. This pick
-
up in economic 
activity is also confirmed by high
-
frequency indicators such as 
electricity consumption.
 
Looking beyond the disruption stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, euro 
area growth is 
resuming with the gradual lifting of 
containment measures, 
supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal stance and 
a
 
re
sumption in global activity.
 
However, u
ncertainty 
remains
 
extremely
 
elevated, 
making it 
very
 
difficult to predict the likely extent and duration of 
the 
recovery. 
The 
results of the latest round of the 
ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters
, conducted 
in early 
July
, show that 
private sector 
GDP growth forecasts
 
have been revised further 
downwards
 
for 2020
 
and
 
have been revised upwards for 2021, 
compared with the 
previous 
round conducted in early 
April.

probability of deflation occurring over the next five years declined considerably from 
the peak se
en at the end of March 2020 to stand close to the levels prevailing in late 
February. The decline in the probability of deflation may to some extent also reflect the 
recent increase in the price of oil. Although an increase has been seen over the review

in the very long term

for loans or 
their 
drawing of credit lines reached the h
ighest net balance since the start 
of the survey in 2003. The higher demand 
from borrowers 
for inventories and working 
capital more than offset the negative contribution of demand for fixed investment. At 
the same time, credit standards 
for
 
loans or credit
 
lines to firms remained favourable.
13
 
While credit standards were supported by government loan guarantees in most 
countries and monetary policy measures, banks continued to indicate risk perceptions 
(related to the deterioration in the general economic 
out
look 
and 
the 
firm
-
specific 
situation) as the main factor contributing to the tightening of credit standards. Banks 
also reported lower risk tolerance than in the previous survey round. For the third 
quarter of 2020, banks expect credit standards for firms 
to tighten considerably, which 
is reported to be related to the expected end
ing
 
of 
the state guarantee schemes in 
some large euro area countries. Turning to households, net demand for housing loans 
and for consumer credit decreased considerably in the seco
nd quarter, on account of 
weaker consumer confidence, 
declining
 
housing market prospects
 
and low spending 
possibilities during the strict lockdown period. Credit standards on household loans 
tightened s
ignificantly
 
in the second quarter of 2020. This development was
 
attributable to a 

owing 
to
 
the COVID

. Banks expect the net tightening of credit standards to 
continue and

In the second quarter of 2020, the net percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards (i.e.

net tightening was 20% for loans to households for house purchase and 25% for consumer credit and 
other lending to households.

US d

amid volatile financial markets.
 
This box focuses on
 
these tensions in
 
the foreign

market participants

funds in 
two currencies

provides 
evidence on the positive impact 
of the swap li
nes between central banks
 
on the 
functioning of the EUR/USD FX swap market. These central bank swap lines enable 
the Eurosystem to provide US dollars to euro area banks.

not only helped banks to satisfy their immediate

dollar funding needs but also supported market activity, as banks participating in 
the US dollar operations became more willing to intermediate and passed funds

to other market participants. This was 
key to
 
reducing tensions
 
on US dollar funding conditions and
 
restor

The FX swap basis spread is the difference between the a

rate, which is represented by the US dollar overnight index swap (OIS) rate. Under 
normal market conditions, the FX swap basis spread is small
16
 
a

temporary market frictions, such as those related to balance sheet reporting dates. 
However, from the end of

Swap lines between central banks allow a c
entral bank 
(the ECB in this case) 
to receive foreign currency 
liquidity
 
(US dollars) 
from the issuing central bank
 
(the Federal Reserve System)
, which keeps the 
recipient currency
 
(the euro)
 
as collateral until maturity. In turn, the recipient central ban
k lends the 
foreign currency liquidity
 
that
 
it receives 
to 
domestic banks against eligible collateral. 
In line with the 
ECB's press release
 
published on 17 June 2014, US dollar tender operations offered by the Eurosystem 
follow a fixed rate and full allotment procedure, i.e. the ECB satisfies all bids received from counterparties 
against eligible collateral
.
 
In 2011 the ECB, together with the
 
Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, the 
Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank, established a network of swap lines 
enabling the participating central banks to obtain currency from each other. For more details, see the

basis

above the average level 
recorded
 
in February
 
2020 (see Chart A).
 
Despite the announcement of enhanced 
central bank 
swap lines on 15 March, 
the 
premium to borrow 
US 
dollar
s
 
in the
 
EUR
/USD
 
FX swap market 
initially 
continued to
 
rise
, especially in the short

term tenors.
 
Given the 
deteriorating
 
US
 
dollar
 
funding conditions worldwide, on 15 March the Federal Reserve
 
System
, the 
ECB
, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Swiss Nationa
l Bank and the Bank 
of Canada 
announced coordinated action to enhance the provision of US dollar 
liquidity through the 
standing 
swap line arrangements
.
 
17
 
The ECB announced that 
the Eurosystem would offer 84
-
day operations from 18 March onwards, in addition
 
to 
the existing 7
-
day operations. Moreover,
 
the pricing 
of both operations 
was lowered by 
25 
basis points
 
to 
a level equal to 
the US dollar OIS rate plus 25 
basis points
. 
T
he 
announcement 
itself 
brought little relief 
to
 
US
 
dollar
 
funding premia 
in the EUR/USD 
FX swap market, particularly in short maturities. Accordingly, short
-
term US dollar 
borrowing rates 
started 
to 
grow exponentially and 
the overnight FX swap basis spread 
peaked
 
at 6
44 basis points
 
on 17 March, on the eve of the first US
 
dolla
r
 
operation
s
 
under the 
enhanc
ed swap line
 
conditions
.
 
The 

US
 
dollar
 
operations 
under more 
favourable pricing conditions as of 18 March 
produced significant relief 
for
 
short
-
term US dollar
 
funding conditions in the EUR/US
D FX swap market, while 
longer maturities were affected
 
less.
 
On 18 March, when the 84
-
day US
 
dollar
 
operation was offered for the first time since the spring of 2014, the ECB allotted USD 
76 
billion to 44 bidders
 
in the 84
-
day
 
operation and USD 36 
billion
 
to 22 bidders in the 
7
-
day operation
. 
T
he
 
total allotment of
 
USD 112 
billion
 
on 
18 March
 
was the highest in 
a single day since 2008
. Both operations were substantially cheaper than 
comparable 
market prices and, according to market feedback, th
e significan
t take
-
up and large 
number of participating banks helped to 
remov
e
 
the possible
 
stigma
 
attached to 

. 
After
 
the results of the US
 
dollar
 
operations 
were announced, MMSR 
reporting agents
 
reported 
significantly lower 
US
 
dollar 
funding
 
premia
 
for 
short
-
term
 
transactions, with the 
overnight FX swap basis spread 
falling by 476 basis points to 168 basis points
. 
In contrast, t
he 
three
-
month 
FX swap 
basis
 
spread temporarily
 
tightened
, but to a lesser extent,
 
from 157 basis 
points to 107 
basis points, before rising again to 144
 
basis points
 
on 19 March
. Owing to the highly 
uncertain market outlook related to potential abrupt US dollar outflows, banks initially 

r facility. Only a 
portion of this liquidity was passed through to the market. This was mostly in shorter 
tenors, which limited the relief on longer
-
term US dollar funding premia.

that 
conditions started to improve sustainably 
across all tenors
, 
as 
uncertainty about US dollar availability abated.
 
Market participants considered the 
provision of daily operations to be useful as the daily frequency reduced the 
uncertainty
 
around the availability of US dollars to accommodate daily funding needs. 
In addition to the introduction of daily 7

US dollar 
operations, the Eurosystem 
continued to provide week
ly
 
operation
s
 
with a longer maturity of 84
 
days
,
 
which 
ensured that US d
ollar funds were available to euro area banks over a longer horizon. 
These two measures combined supported the gradual pass

obtained in US dollar operations
 
to the market and

The US dollar borrowing rate is the rate paid by MMSR reporting agents to receive US dollars in the EUR/USD FX swap 
market at different maturities. The overnight US dollar borrowing rate in th
e EUR/USD FX swap market is based on
 
tomorrow/next day 
transactions.
 
US dollar funding costs in the EUR/USD FX swap market
 
remained
,
 
however, 
at 
elevated levels 
in the run
-
up to
 
the March quarter
-
end.
 
As banks need to report 
certain regulatory ratios at th
e quarter
-
end, they are typically reluctant to expand their 
balance sheets for intermediation activity that covers the quarter
-
end. 
The March 
quarter
-
end 
is
 
also the fiscal year
-
end for banks in jurisdictions 
such as
 
Japan, where
 
tax is determined by
 
the 
s
ize of the 
balance sheet, 
therefore 
the relief from the US 
dollar operations was 
reduced
 
around the quarter
-
end period.
 
As a result
, funding 
conditions 
in EUR/USD FX swap markets
 
continued to be volatile in 
the run

up to the

On 20 March 2020 
the Federal Reserve, the ECB
, the
 
Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Swiss 
National Bank and the Bank of Canada 
announced
 
an increase in the frequency of the 7

day maturity 
operations from weekly to daily. 
These daily operations commenced on 23 March 2020 and were 
intended to further
 
enhance the provision of liquidity via the standing US dollar liquidity swap line 
arrangements.

After the quarter

for

In line with these developments and what

Central bank

Overall, a

elevated
 
following
 
the launch 
of the enhanced 
US dollar provision by the central banks and 
increased further after the March quarter

This indicates
 
that funds borrowed by

on to 
other

participants
, 
thereby 
providing relief to US
 
dollar
 
funding
 
conditions in the EUR/USD FX swap market, especially in short maturities
.
 
In 
particular, 
MMSR transaction
 
data show that a large group of 
euro area 
banks 
participating in the 

US

operations increased
 
their daily US

significantly
. In particular

these lending volumes 
grew 
on 
average 
by USD 34 b
illio
n between 1 and 20 April, amid 
declining
 
US
 
dollar
 
funding 
premia. 
As they are among the largest banks in Europe, 
MMSR 
rep
orting agents
 
usually trade with a large number of counterparties
,
 
which means that
 
the
 
US dollar
 
funds are likely to have been distributed widely
.
21
 
 
The 
supply 
of 
US
 
dollars
 
via 
E
urosystem
 
operations allowed 
large European 
banks
 
to restore their US
 
dollar
 
intermediation role
, which 
had been
 
disrupted 
by the crisis in March.
 
MMSR 
reporting agents
 
are important intermediators in 
the
 
US dollar market and provide US
 
dollar
 
liquidity to 
various 
other 
market 
counterparties.
 
Taken t
ogether
, MMSR reporting agents
 
are usually net lenders
 
of US 
dollars in the EUR/USD FX swap market.
 
This 
mean
s
 
that they have a surplus of US 
dollar
s
 
which,
 
in normal times
,
 
is invested in the 
EUR/USD 
FX swap market. 
However, 
some 
reporting agents 
saw their net 
lending 
position
 

 
measu
red by
 
the difference 
between
 
the volumes of
 
US dollar
s
 
lent and borrowed
 
by them in the EUR/USD FX 
swap market

surplus 
dropped
 
from USD 153 b

n to 
USD 
82 b
illio
n
 
(see Chart D)
. 
Moreo
ver, t
he MMSR 
reporting agents that took part in the Eurosystem's US dollar operations accounted for 
around three
-
quarters of total take
-
up in these operations.
22
 
Overall, these reporting 
agents saw a very large decline in their net lending position and eve
n became net 
borrowers of US dollars in the EUR/USD FX swap market in the run
-
up to the 
enhanced US dollar provision, while the net lending position of the other reporting 
agents decreased only marginally.
 
After 
these reporting agents took part
 
in the 
Euro

operations
,
 
the total 
net 
lending 
position
 
in the EUR/USD FX 
swap market started to normalise and
 
reach

USD

illio
n on 21
 
May, 
which was 
USD 
79 b
illio
n more than during the peak of the crisis
 
on 17
 
March
. This suggests that 
the US
 
dollar
 
operations 
were
 
effective in providing relief to the market and 
in 
offsetting the effect of the shocks registered during the first half of March, as market 
functioning gradually recovered and banks became more willing to intermediate.

the supply of credit
 
from banks
 
to 
households and businesses, both domestically and abroad.

Between 1 September 2019 and 17 March
 
2020, MMSR 
reporting agents
 
provided US dollar funding to, 
on average, 578 different
 
counterparties per day in the
 
EUR/USD
 
FX swap market. Between
 
18

This box

the
 
economic effects of the coronavirus 
(COVID

pandemic as transmitted through global value chains (GVCs).
 
The world 
economy is
 
facing
 
an unprecedented shock and
,
 
as the impact of the pandemic 
unfolds, world trade will be particularly hard
 
hit. 
This box 
analyses 
the role of 
GVCs 
in 
the pande
mic
 
with a view to quantif
ying 
the ensuing effects on world trade
. 
Our
 
find
ings indicate 
that GVCs could significantly amplify the decline in world trade.
 
World trade has been falling sharply on the back of the COVID
-
19 pandemic,
 
with value chains hit glob
ally
.
 
National accounts 
data 
for key economies
 
point to a 
sharp
 
fall 
in both exports and imports 
in the first quarter
 
of 2020. A 
new 
weekly trade 
tracker 
based on trade indicators available on a timely basis suggests a larger
 
contraction 
in the second quar
ter of 2020 
(
see 
Chart A)
, although some signs of a 
recovery have emerged recently. 
In the 
June 2020 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
proj
ections
, world
 
real imports (excluding the euro area) are expected to decline at 
an 
unprecedented 
pace of around 13% in 2020 
before 
returning to positive rates of 
growth of
 
8.0% and 4.3% in 2021 and 2022 respectively.
 
The
 
decline

OVID

America
s,
 
raising the risk of 
a domino effect with feedback loops that 
could amplify the collapse in global trade. 
T
he sharp fall in Chinese exports of 
intermediate goods across most destinations 
in the first quarter of 2020 (see Chart B)
 
suggests
 
that 
GVCs have already been
 
hit 
widely

Supply 
chain 
linkages 
play an important role in 
the transmission of shocks 
across countries.
 
Although
 
the exp
ansion of GVCs has stalled since the 
2008 
global 
financial crisis, 
trade in 
intermediate goods 
remains important, 
account
ing
 
for 
more 
than
 
40% of world trade
. This has significant
 
implications for the relationship between 
demand, trade, and production. 
Tra
ditional models assume that 

 
imports 
depend on 
its 
domestic demand. However, in a world characterised by complex 
international 
supply chains, changes in demand in third countries
 
are also an 
importa
nt determinant. On average, more than 20% of wo
rld imports serve 
as inputs in
 
domestic
 
production process
es
 
and 
are embedded into goods which are subsequently
 
re
-
exported
. The complex network of s
upply linkages 
is also an important factor in
 
the 
transmission of shocks across countries. Demand shocks in
 
a particular country may 
be passed upstream through the 
global 
production 
network 
to input suppliers, 
with 
the 
initial shock
 
being magnified
 

23
 
while
 
s
upply disruptions can
, in 
turn,
 
be transmitted downstream.

pandemic can be gauged through global input

relates to a situation in which 
a shock triggers

around 
25%. As major supply chain
 
hubs, South Korea, Germany 
and China account for 20% of 
the total 
estimated 
decline in world exports 
arising from
 
indirect linkages.
 
However, as the global economy recovers in the coming quarters, 
GVC linkages could boost world trade. In the 
June 2020 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections, 
global trade is 
expected to rebound faster than global 
activity.
 
GVC
 
spillovers
 
are also likely to affect activity, with the actual impact 
depending on the relative position
s
 
of individual countries in 
GVCs
.
 
For 
example, in countries 
which are positioned 
downstream in the
 
value chain, like 
Mexico, imports 
could fall more than exports (see Chart C
), 
thereby 
providing a small 
net boost to activity. This reflects the fact that Mexico

 
is particularly 
dependent on imported inputs
,
 
which are 
then
 
re
-
exported as fini
shed products. In 
contrast, in countries positioned 
upstream
 
in 
GVCs
 
like
 
the U

, 
there
 
is 
likely to be 
a 
negative 
impact on activity
 
as exports decline more than imports

Notes: 
The chart shows the additional shortfalls that could be generated for each country 
as a result of
 
GVC
-
r
elated spillovers. GVC 
spillovers are
 
expressed 
as a
 
percent
age
 
of losses estimated to occur through t
raditional trade (
i.e.
 
imports and exports of
: (1)
 
final 
goods
,
 
and 
(2) 
intermediate 
goods 
used in production for domestic absorption). 
The chart refers to the short
-
term effects of GVC 
spillovers. Countries shown are the United States (US), China (CN), th
e United Kingdom (UK), Japan (JP) and Mexico (MX).
 
A second quantitative exercise
 
indicates that
 
GVCs had become impaired 
already in the first quarter of 2020.
 
Specifically, the analysis focused on
 
whether 
exports of countries upstream in the Chinese value
 
chain were hit on the back of 
COVID
-
19
-
related lockdowns and demand shock
s
 
in February 2020
 
in China. Our
 
estimate
s are based on
 
a monthly panel model 
covering
 
37 countries and 22 
industries
. For
 
each industry and country
,
 
changes in total exports of inte
rmediate 
goods 
are regressed 
on 
a 
variable 
obtained by multiplying a dummy variable, 
which 
is 
given a 
value 
of 1
 
in February 2020 (i.e. a proxy for the COVID
-
19 shock
 
in China
)
,
 
and a measure of upstreamness 
to
 
China computed for each individual 
industry
-
country pair
.
26
 
The analysis suggests that countries upstream to China in the 
value chain have been hit the hardest, with exports fall
ing by some 3.8% incrementally 
at each stage,
 
as one moves up the supply chain
.
 
The
 
limited period of time available 
over w
hich 
to observe the postulated effect 
requires a cautious interpretation of the 
results
.
 
However, they
 
confirm the presence of amplification
 
caused
 
by
 
GVCs
. In 
addition, 
a breakdown of the results 
by region suggest
s
 
that the decline in Chinese 
demand 
ha
s 
s
o far been 
borne mostly by its trading partners in the Asian value chain.
 
The 
COVID
-
19 
outbreak has exposed the interdependence of countries 
in terms 
of
 
the supply of inputs and final goods.
 
The analysis in this 
box
 
suggests that 
GVC 
spillovers could 
magni
fy the
 
decline in world trade
, adding 
some 25%
 
to the effects 
which could occur on the back of bilateral linkages
. Econometric analysis corroborates 
this, suggesting that

O
ur 
index
 
of upstreamness is obtained by measuring the number of intermediate production stages fo
r 
each industry
-
country export prior to
 
absorption
 
in China.
 
In pa
rticular, the index 
is constructed by 
assigning 
a 
value 
of 
1 to the share of output 
of a given country/industry 
directly sold to final consumers in 
China, 
a 
value 
of 
2 to the share of output sold to consumers in China after being used as
 
an
 
intermediate 
go
od 
by 
one other
 
industry
,
 
and so on. 
The index is calculated using nominal data provided by the 
input
-
output tables from the 2015
 
edition of the OECD Trade in Value Added database
.
 
The r
esults are 
therefore likely to be sensitive to price
 
effects.

Since March 2020 the severity of the economic and financial implications 
stemming from the 
coronavirus (COVID
-
19)
 
crisis 
has 
bec
o
me 
increasingly 
ap
parent
.
 
The ECB has responded with a decisive policy package
 
that
 
is designed to 
be targeted
 
and
 
proportionate to the unprecedented scale of the crisis 
as well as 
temporary
, as 
the emergency 
and its aftermath are
 
expected 
to be reabsorbed 
over 
time
. The
se
 
measures have supported liquidity and funding conditions in the euro area 
economy, averted the most adverse 
feedback loops between the real economy and 
financial markets, and 
shor
ed
 
up confidence
.
 
They
 
are also expected to significantly 
contribute to 
ensur
ing
 
that inflation
 
in the euro area
 
moves towards 
levels that are 
below, but close, to 2%

onetary policy
 
response has focused on 
addressing three key issues
: 
(i) market stabilisation, which is a precondition for 
avoiding fragmentation and 
safeguard
ing
 
the 
monetary policy 
transmission 
mechanism
 
across the euro area;
 
(ii)
 
providing
 
ample central bank liquidity
 
to support 
credit provision
 
to the real economy;
 
and (iii) 
ensur
ing
 
that the overall stance is 
sufficiently accommodative.
27
 
As the severity of the pand
emic crisis emerged, investors rebalanced their 
portfolios, thereby causing liquidity in several securities markets to dry up and 
increasing the demand for safe assets.
 
The
 
sharp decline in stock and bond market 
indices, combined with the
 
increase in marke
t
-
based financing costs for firm
s, 
contributed to a marked tightening of financial conditions between mid
-
February and 
mid
-
March 2020. In this
 
environment
,
 
there was a very tangible risk of adverse liquidity 
spirals and an overshooting of asset price corre
ctions in many markets, which would 
endanger financial stability 
and 
impede the transmission of monetary policy
.
 
In a monetary union, 
increased 
risk 
perception can lead to

dynamics

The announcement of the pandemic emergency purchase

in March, with its inherent flexibility, has acted as a powerful 
market

stabilising
 
force.
 
Policy 
measures aimed at releasing the balance sheet constraints of the private 
sector are particularly effective in periods of heightened market s
tress. In this vein, the
 
announcement of the PEPP halted the 
tightening in financial conditions

At the same time, t

provision of ample central bank
 
liquidit
y to 
help support
 
the cred
it flow to the real economy has also 
been central to the 

policy response to the COVID
-
19 crisis.
 
This
 
is particularly relevant in the euro 
area, where banks play a key role in financial intermediation.
 
The provision
 
of central 
bank liquidity comes in the form of targeted and non
-
targeted programmes. With 
respect to the former, the recalibration of TLTRO III in April 2020 included a 
considerably more favourable interest
 
rate on TLTRO III operations during the period 
f
rom June 2020 to June 2021.
 
This followed the March 2020 decision to increase the

maximum amount that counterparties are entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations.
28
 
In line with this, banks
 
indicated in the April 
2020 euro area 
bank lending survey that 
TLTRO III is having a net easing impact on the terms and conditions offered to 
borrowers
,
 
and a positive net impact on their lending volumes, particularly their 
expected lending volumes over the next six months
. The changes to the terms of 
TLTRO III were f
ollowed by a large expansion in the central bank funding of banks. In 
the June 2020

TLTRO

funds, which is the largest amount allotted to date under any sing
le lending operation. 
In relation
 
to non
-
targeted programmes, t
he ECB 
announced, in March 2020, 
a
dditional longer
-
term refinancing operations (LTROs) to provide immediate liquidity 
support to the euro area financial system
 
and, in April 2020, a series of non

perations (PELTRO
s
)
. The PELTROs 
serve as a backstop by
 
helping to 
ensur
e
 
sufficient liquidity and smooth money market 
conditions in response to the crisis
.
29
 
Once 
market stabilisation and maintaining credit provision to the real econ
omy
 
were
 
attained, and the ramifications of the pandemic crisis on the baseline 
macroeconomic outlook bec
a
me clearer, the PEPP recalibration in June
 
2020
 
was able to 
further eas
e
 
the general monetary policy stance
.
 
In line with the 

dual role of reki
ndling the initial stages of the transmission of monetary policy 
and easing the general monetary policy stance
, and i
n response to the 
pandemic
-
related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon,
 
the 
recalibration of the PEPP in June 2020 h
as further eased the general monetary policy 
stance to make it commensurate to the outlook for medium
-
term inflation. By 
extracting the duration risk held by investors through its purchases, the ECB 
reinforces the impact of its negative interest rate polic
y and forward guidance on rates 
by pushing down the medium and long end of the yield curve.
30
 
Taken together,
 
the PEPP 
decisions from March and June 2020 
a
s well as the 
scaling
-
up of the asset purchase programme (APP) decided in March 2020 are
 
estimated 
to 
have
 
reduced the
 
euro area GDP
-
weighted
 
ten
-
year sovereign 
yield
 
by almost 45 basis points
.
31
 
However, such estimates are likely to be on the 
conservative side as they are based on estimates of the elasticities of sovereign yields 
to purchases derived from the public sector purchase programme (PSPP). Evidence 
from event studies, which examine the 
financial market reaction to the PEPP 
announcements, suggests a higher PEPP elasticity compared with the PSPP 
                                        
                           
 
28
 
 
In particular, the interest rate on TLTRO III operations
 
during the period from June 2020 to June 2021
 
is 

prevailing over the same 
period. For counterparties whose eligible net lending reaches the lending 
performance threshold, the interest rate over the period from June 2020 to June 2021 
can be as low as 
50 basis points below
 
the average deposit facility rate prevailing over the same
 
period.
 
The borrowing 
allowance is 50% of the stock of eligible loans.
 
29
 
 
The 
PE
LTROs consist of seven refinancing operations commencing on 20 May 2020 and maturing in a 
staggered sequence between July and September 2021. They 
are
 
carried out as fixed rat
e tender 
procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the 
main refinancing operations prevailing over the life of each PELTRO
.

The assessment considers the 

 
overall envelope of the PEPP announced in March, the 
increase of the envelope by 

600 billion announced in June, and the additional 

120 billion temporary 
envelope 
under the APP 
until the end of 2

higher elasticity might reflect the flexibility embedded in

Therefore, in the absence of the PEPP, sovereign yields could ha
ve 
escalated to even higher levels.
 
The 
macroeconomic impact
 
By counteracting the
 
tightening of 
financial conditions 
that 
confront
ed the
 
euro 
area 
economy in the face of the COVID
-

have been providing 
crucial support to 
the real economy
 
and, ultimately, to 
price stability
.
 
Th
is
 
support operates a
cross
 
two broad dimensions: 
(
i) underpinning 
the medium
-
term growth and inflation outlook, and 
(
ii) removing tail risks around the 
baseline scenario.
 
In terms of 
und
e
rpinning the 
medium
-
term growth and inflation outlook
, ECB 
staff estimate that
, taken together, the PEPP, the scaling
-
up of the APP and the 
recent TLTRO III recalibration
 
will add around 1.3 percentage points
 
cumulatively
 
to 
euro area real GDP growth 
over the 
projectio
n horizon
,
 
and 
contribute around 0.8 percentage points cumulatively to the annual inflation 
rate over the same time horizon (see Chart B).
 
At the same time, 
while monetary 
policy typically acts with a transmission lag, 
the positive impact on consumer and 
b
usiness confidence
 
created by
 
acting 
swiftly and decisively
 
during a crisis
 
should not 
be
 
overlooked and
 
can accelerate and 
support
 
the 
transmission of 
monetary policy to 
growth and inflation
.

These estimates do not fully capture the benefits gained from avoiding 
feedback loops between the real 
economy and financial markets
 
that
 
may 
emerge in 
an 
economic cris
i
s 
such as that caused by COVID
-
19, in which the 
main contribution of monetary policy
 
is
 
to remove tail risks around the baseline 
macroeconomic outlook
.
 
Econometric evidence points to the exi
stence of large 
non
-
linearities in the macroeconomic reaction to shocks to financial conditions. I
n 
other words, the impact of a given change in financial conditions depends on the state 
of the economy
.
 
This means that 
under acute financial market stress, 
the presence of 
financial frictions and balance sheet constraints implies severe non
-
linearities that 
may 
translate into much larger contractionary effects brought on by a tightening of 
financial conditions.
 
Given the severity of the shock associated with 
the COVID
-
19 
crisis, a tightening 
of
 
financial conditions in the current environment would be 
expected to have an impact several times larger than the one captured by the average 
elasticities employed
 
in Chart B
 
to quantify the impact of the policy
. 
Therefore, 
monetary policy measures aimed at counteracting such deterioration in financial 
conditions would deliver a stronger contribution to price stability than is captured by 
standard elasticities derived from the more normal conditions underpinning th
e above 
quantification.

measures is clearly

in 
the improving 
financi

conditions for 
the overall 
economy, and the deployment of a combination of asset purchases and TLTROs 
reflects the fact that they are efficient tools under the current circumstances.

Recent developments in equity prices and earnings growth

result
 
of the 
expected economic fallout from the 
global spread of 
the 
coronavirus (
COVID

)
 
and the 
considerable 
associated
 
uncertainty, euro area 
equity prices fell by more than 30% fro
m February to mid

).
 
At the same time

Th

is
 
for 
14
 
Ju
ly
 
2020.
 
With the announcement of the 
pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(
PEPP
)
, euro area equity prices started to recover (
see 
Chart
 
A
) and market 
functioning 
has moved
 
c
loser to normal levels, with bid
-
ask spreads 
dec
reasing sharply
.
 
Equity prices, especially those of US non
-
financial corporations 
(NFCs), also improved considerably, buoyed 
by 
the 
measures taken by central banks 
and governments 
in
 
many
 
countries. 
The 
recovery in 
equity price
s
 
looks even stronger 
when judged against the historical distribution of forward
-
looking valuation metrics 
(
see Chart B).
 
Owing to
 
adjustment

in near

and a near

, forward price
-
earnings ratios
 
(
P/E ratios)
 
for NFCs 
have now 
moved above 
pre
-
COVID
-

While this is also the case 
for euro area 
banks, 
their 
valuations remain
 
more
 
subdued.
 
However, in the light of the recent rapid

looking P/E ratio for the 
euro area has been
 
recorded monthly si
nce 1987.
 
The latest observation is for 14
 
July
 
2020.
 
The main reason for the rebound in equity prices 
is
 
a recovery in risk sentiment
 
which, based on a decomposition using a dividend discount model, seems to 
have more than compensated for the declines in earnings expectations
 
(
see 
Chart
 
C
).
 
Between early February and mid
-
March
 
2020
 
the euro area equity risk 
premium (ERP) increased from 
8% to 12%
, before decreasing to below 9% after the 
PEPP announcement
. 
Although there is some uncertainty surrounding the estimation 
of the ERP, according to a dividend discount model, the fluctuations in the ERP 
explain 
both the lion

 
share of the initial
 
decline in equity prices
 
and
 
most of the 
subsequent 
recovery.
 
At the same time, 

earnings expectations have been adjusted 
down
wards
. 
In the wake of the lockdown measures implemented across euro area 
countries, s

since 2009

recently 
as the economic recovery is 
expected to gradually take hold
. By contrast,

longer

term 
earnings expectations remained surprisingly 
resilient
,
 
in line with prospects of a strong 
and rapid 
recovery in 
earnin
gs (see Chart D). More recently, they have
 
been adjusted 
downwards by 
more than 3
 
percentage points to below 8
% 
per annum
. Despite this 
drop, longer
-
term earnings expectations remain
 
higher than at the low
 
point of the 
global financial crisis.

quity prices and short versus longer

term revisions to the macro 
outlook
 
In the light of th
e ongoing gradual downward adjustment of longer
-
term 
earnings prospects, t
he 
recovery in short
-
term 
earnings prospects has been an 
important counterbalance.
 
Equity prices reflect the discounted value of all future 
dividend streams, where the weight of 
divi
dends in 
the near term depends on the 

Therefore
, the 
(initial) 
resilience of longer
-
term earnings prospects
 
(more than one year ahead)
 
and the 
recent recovery in short
-
term earnings prospects (i.e. o
ver the next year) 
could explain 
some of the relative robustness 
of 
and recent recovery 
in
 
equity prices.
 
Results of a 
regression analysis which makes use of past 
Consensus Economics forecast vintages 
to assess the impact of past changes in GDP growth expe
ctations on equity prices at 
different horizons
 
suggest that
 
investors 
tend to attach 
equal weight 
to 
short
-
term 
forecasts and 
longer
-
term
 
expectations when evaluating the market implications of 
macroeconomic developments. 
Overall, the 
risk of significant 
further declines in equity 
prices
 
still remains,
 
especially if
 
long
-
term 
GDP growth expectations 
are
 
adjusted 
down further 
or the recent upward revisions to the near
-
term outlook decline again (as 
a result of a potential second wave of the coronavirus and 
consequent policy 
responses, for example).
 
Signals about the shape of the recovery derived from earnings per 
share forecasts, dividends and options
 
In addition to 

-
term earnings growth expectations
,
 
earnings per 
share (EPS) forecasts 
also continue to be revised down at longer horizons 
(
see 
Chart 
E
).
 
In
 
mid

March
 
2020
 
the pattern of 
surveyed 
quarterly earnings forecasts 
continued to 
largely 
signal a V
-
shaped recovery
,
 
despite weak realised earnings in 
the 
first quarter of 2020
. Analysts
 
foresaw a rapid recovery from 
the second quarter
 
onwards as economies were 
expected
 
to gradually emerge from lockdown.
 
Since 
then, notwithstanding the announcement of the PEPP, 
the general level of 
medium
-
term 
earnings expectations has continued to be rev
ised downwards
, 
even
 
though euro area stock prices recovered over the same period.

was
 
(marginally) 
the case in February
 
2020
,
 
for instance,
 
and 
downward sloping in times of financial stress, caused by the risk of large potential 
losses in the near future. In line 
with this conjecture, and immediately 
before
 
the 
announcement of the PEPP, 
the 
ERP at the one

month horizon surged to around 30%. 
Despite a significant decline since then, the ERP

Already in early 
February, before the outbreak of the

19 pandemic in Europe, options markets 
signalled a large imbalance of left
 
tail risk 
two to three
 
months ahead, with a reduction 
afterwards. Following the equity mark

tail 
risk 
and right
 
tail 
risk 
became 
more balanced for the months ahead. This 
was
 
the result of investors

more weight 
to 
the possibility of a 
further price 
recovery (i.e. 
increasing the odds of good risk 
v

bad risk) and 
was 
in line with a decline in the

since the height of the pandemic
. However, 
owing to the recent cascade of

remained 
highly skewed to the left when

(see

Prepared by Vasco Botelho, Agostino Consolo and António Dias da 
Silva
 
This box an
alyses labour market developments in the euro area since the onset 
of the coronavirus (COVID
-
19) pandemic
.
 
The containment measures implemented 
from mid
-
March resulted in a sharp fall in euro area real GDP in the first quarter of 
2020.
35
 
Business and consum
er survey data indicate that the fall deepened in April 
and May. However, employment and unemployment do not appear to have been 
significantly affected. In this regard, the reaction of the euro area labour market to the 
COVID
-
19 pandemic appears in sharp c
ontrast with that observed in the United 
States, where unemployment increased rapidly. This box examines the discrepancy 
between business and consumer
 
survey 
indicators and 
the main headline labour 
market indicators
 
for the euro area. In addition,
 
we 
discu
ss 
the 
possible 
effects of 
lockdown measures on unemployment statistics in view of the internationally agreed 
definition of unemployment
, and
 
elaborate on
 
the adjustment of hours worked and on
 
the widespread use of short
-
time work schemes
 
and 
temporary lay
-
offs, which 
are
 
the 
key
 
polic
ies
 
that have supported
 
the euro
 
area
 
labour market 
since the start
 
of the 
COVID
-
19 
pandemic
.
 
Monthly surveys on employment perceptions and expectations point to a 
strong deterioration in the euro area labour market.
 
The
 
PMI indicator of 
employment perceptions declined from levels of 51.4 in February 2020 to an historic 
low of 33.4 in April, rebounding to 43.1 in June as a consequence of the loosening in 
the containment measures during this period (see Chart A). The decli
ne was 
particularly acute in the services sector, with the accommodation, food and beverage 
services and the warehousing and transportation sector being most affected. As for 
the manufacturing sector, the decline was also broad
-
based across sectors, and mo
st 
prominent for motor vehicles, fabricated metal products, and machinery and 
equipment sectors.
 
Overall, such large declines in these surveys point to a strong 
contraction in employment in the second quarter of 2020.

36
 
 
A similar message is given by high
-
frequency indicators of developments in the euro area labour market, 
such as the 
Indeed
 
job postings indicator and the 
LinkedIn
 
hiring rate indicator. These high
-
 
frequency 
indicators reveal a large decline in
 
labour demand and the number of job hires in the euro area since the 
start of the containment measures and lockdowns. For further details, refer to the box entitled 

-

nomic 
Bulletin. Beyond these high
-
frequency indicators, the survey data indicator on labour as a factor limiting 
production from the European Commission Business and Consumer Survey shows a sharp contraction 
in labour demand for all of the main sectors, wi
th the services sector recording the steepest fall.

Notes: A level below 50 indicates a contraction in employment.
 
The latest observation is for June 2020.
 
There was a historic decline in the number of hours worked in the first quarter 
of 2020, which helped put into context the muted 
response of employment.
 
Although containment measures in the majority of euro area countries only started in 
mid
-
March, total hours worked, as recorded in the national accounts, dropped quarter 
on quarter by 3.1% in the first quarter of 2020, in line with 
the observed 3.6% decline in 
real GDP in the same quarter. The decline in hours worked was almost twice as large 
as that recorded in the first quarter of 2009. The decline in hours worked in the first 
quarter of 2020 was mostly driven by an adjustment in t
he intensive margin of labour
, 
i.e. the average number of hours worked per 
person 
employe
d. In the first quarter of 
2020, average hours worked decreased quarter on quarter by 2.9%, while the decline 
in employment remained relatively muted in the changing e
conomic environment at 
0.2% (see Chart B). The relative contributions of average hours worked (around 90%) 
and employment (around 10%) to the decline in total hours worked contrast with those 
observed in the first quarter of 2009, where both margins accoun
ted for roughly half of 
the decline of total hours worked.

Note: The latest observation is for the first quarter of 2020.
 
The moderate increas
e in the u
nemployment
 
rate up to the end of May is in 
sharp contrast with indicators of economic activity.
 
The increase in the 
unemployment rate until the end of May was lower than what could have been 
expected based on its historical relationship with GDP
 
(see Chart C). In the United 
States, between January 2020 and May 2020, the number of non
-
farm payroll 
employees decreased by 19.5 million and the unemployment rate increased by 
9.8
 
percentage points.
37
 
By contrast, the muted responses of employment and 
un
employment during the COVID
-
19 crisis in the euro area compared with the labour 
market dynamics observed for the United States have been a noticeable feature of the 
euro area labour market.
38
 
The reclassification of some people from unemployment 
into inactivity could be affecting the unemployment statistics. 
According to the 
International Labour Organization

 
definition of unemployment, persons losing their 
jobs or being previously unemployed
 
should be classified 
as being 
outside the labour 
force if they are not actively searching for a job or are not available to take up 
employment at short notice. 
This feature would lead to a 
muted response in terms of 
the rise in unemployment resulting from
 
the COVID
-
19 containment measures
.
39
 
Another key difference is that, in the United States, temporarily laid off workers are 
considered unemployed, whereas in the euro area the persons affected by short
-
time 
work schemes or temporary lay
-
offs remain, in mos

are thus not considered unemployed
.
 
                                        
                           
 
37
 
 
The number of non
-
farm payroll employees in the United States stood at 152.4 million workers in 
February 2020 and at 132.9 million workers in May 2020. There was a slight rebound in employment 
between 
April and May, with the number of non
-
farm payroll employees increasing by 2.5 million workers, 
up from 130.4 million workers in April 2020. The unemployment rate in the United States followed a 
similar path to that of employment, standing at levels of 3.5
% in February 2020, edging up to 14.7% in 
April 2020 and observing a slight rebound to 13.3% in May 2020.

The reclassification of some people from unemployment to inactivity could exert downward pressure on 
the unemployment rate. In this regard, monthly data on the number of inactive people could help assess 
how transition into activity
 
may be affecting the observed unemployment rate.

The widespread use of short
-
time work schemes in the euro area is one of the 
key factors behind the overall muted immediate response of the labour market 
to the COVID
-
19 crisis.
 
The national governments of euro area countries have 
imple

19 pandemic.
 
In particular, short
-
time work
 
schemes and temporary lay
-
offs
 
have been put in place
 
across the euro area 
countries

succe
ssfully
 
containing
 
dismissals
, supporting incomes and helping firms to 
effectively reduce their payroll costs.

during the COVID
-
19 crisis, these schemes have played an important role in helping 

 
their liquidity needs, while allowing them to 
res
ume
 
activity more 
swiftly 
after the lockdown by keeping the worker
-
job relationship intact during the 
lockdown
.
 
The number of workers in short
-
time work schemes is unprecedented 
across euro area countries.
41
 
Preliminary estimates of the number of workers affected 

employees have been affected. These could amount to a maximum of 10.6 million 
employees in Germany (26% of the tota
l number of employees in the country), 
12
 
million employees in France (47% of employees), 
8
.1
 
million in Italy (4
2
% of 
employees), 3.9 million in Spain (23% of employees) and 1.7 million in the 
Netherlands (21% of employees)
.
42
 
Indeed, if one takes into account the number of 
workers in short
-
time work schemes and on temporary lay
-
offs, the unemployment 
rate in the euro area would have reached much higher levels than those currently

The success of the widespread use of short
-
time work sch
emes in supporting 
the euro area labour market will depend critically on the dynamics and duration 
of the crisis
.
 
L
abour market policies
, in particular short
-
time work schemes and 
temporary lay
-
offs,
 
are 
supporting employment and mitigating the increase
 
in
 
the 
unemployment rate
 
in the euro area
. 
These measures can support a faster recovery of 
the labour market, as they allow firms and workers to resume activity without the costly 
and lengthy process of search and matching that would have to occur once the 
e
mployment relationship was lost. This is even more important, as the crisis is more 
likely to affect low
-
skilled workers, which usually have higher unemployment rates. 
Nonetheless, it is to be expected that not all workers in short
-
time work schemes and 
on
 
temporary lay
-
offs will be able to return to their previous jobs.
43
 
As a consequence, 
a further increase in unemployment in the euro area is expected in the short term.

This box 
provides an overview of 
the
 
impact of the coronavirus (

pandemic 
on euro area labour markets by examining high
-
frequency indicators.
 
The first part o
f the box analyses 
information 
from 
Indeed

 
daily job postings and 
LinkedIn

 
daily hiring rates for the 
five 
largest euro area countries
. T
he number of job 
postings from 
Indeed
 
can be used as a proxy for
 
changes in labour demand.
 
The 
LinkedIn
 
hiring
 
rate
 
provides information both at the aggregate and sectoral levels 
about the number of job hires in the euro area. The second part of the box illustrates 
how the 
LinkedIn
 
hiring rate can be used to perform a nowcasting of the job finding 
rate and make an asse
ssment of the unemployment rate, 
thereby providing 
more 
timely
 
information
 
about labour market developments
 
than 
that derived from more 
traditional statistical sources.
 
That said, the information contained in these 
high
-
frequency indicators should be viewe
d with caution and used to complement 
official statistics, given that the available samples are mostly concentrated in 
white
-
collar jobs and in certain sectors.
 
The hiring rate 
ha
s
 
declined significantly 
since
 
the onset of the COVID
-
19 crisis
, 
with it bottoming out 
in May 2020 (see Chart A)
.
 
At

Notes: The latest observation is for 20 June 2020.
 
Daily
 
hiring rates are calculated as the percentage of 
LinkedIn
 
members who started 
a job on a given day of the month and added a new
 
employer to their profile in that month, divided by the total number of 
LinkedIn
 
members in that country. To 
adjust for
 
seasonal patterns and spikes due to specific calendar dates, 
the

hiring rate indicator 
is 
transformed using a 30

day moving average and 
is
 
presented in terms of 
its
 
year

Data on job postings have 
declined 
significantly
 
since
 
the COVID

19 crisis
 
(see 
Chart B) and continue to signal weak 
labour demand conditions
.
 
At the start of

in the job postings indicator stood at 9.8% 
in Germany (22 March), 11.9% 
in France (

in Italy (
21

While job hires have now 
bottomed out, job postings remain subdued, as this relationship is not perfectly 
aligned, since some job matches are made through referrals without any vacancies 
being posted or there can be a time lapse in the search and matching
 
process. The 
Indeed
 
job postings indicator reflects developments in labour demand and may be 
regarded as an indicator of vacancies, while the 
LinkedIn
 
hiring rate indicator is more 
closely related to the job

to
-
job transitions and to the job finding rate.

Sectoral data on hiring rates reveal a broadly based dec
line across all sectors 
of the five largest euro area countries (see Chart C)
.
 
We use sectoral information 
at a monthly frequency to decompose the decline in the 
LinkedIn
 
hiring rate and to 
identify the sectors that may have been most affected during the C
OVID
-
19 crisis.
46
 
In 
particular, we analysed 12 sectors: the consumer goods, corporate services, 
education, entertainment, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, media and 
communications, recreation and travel, retail, and software and IT services sectors, 
wit
h the remaining sectors of the economy being bundled into a residual sector. The 
aforementioned sectors encompass over 70% of the total number of job changes 
recorded in 
LinkedIn
 
for the five largest euro area countries. In June 2020, the majority 
of the s
ectors of the five largest euro area countries denoted yearly declines in their 
hiring rates, with the largest sectoral contributions to the decline being observed in the 
aggregate hiring rate stemming from the manufacturing, corporate services, software 
a
nd IT services, and recreation and travel sectors.

industries and the

The exceptions to the broad sectoral decline in the hiring rates recorded in June 2020 are the healthcare 
sector in both Germany and France, the education sector in Germany and the retail sector in France.

The intensity of the COVID
-
19 shock is asymmetric across sectors (see 
Chart
 
D).
 
While the decline in the hiring rate was broad
-
based across sectors, some 
sectors are more affected by the COVID
-
1
9 shock than others. Two polar cases of this 
asymmetry of the shock across sectors are the recreation and travel and the 
healthcare sectors. On the one hand, the recreation and travel sector has been 
particularly affected by the crisis and by the lockdowns
, with the hiring rate in the 
sector decreasing year on year in June 2020 by 44.0% in Germany, 28.8% in France, 
77.9% in Italy, 50.1% in Spain, and by 28.3% in the Netherlands. On the other hand, 
the healthcare sector seems to be relatively more insulated 
from the COVID
-
19 shock 
in terms of the yearly increase in the relative number of job changes in the sector, 
driven partially by the increasing demand for healthcare services to contain the 
pandemic. The hiring rate in this sector increased year on year in
 
June 2020 by 18.0% 
in Germany and by 20.7% in France, and decreased year on year in June 2020 by 
9.9% in Italy, 22.5% in Spain, and by 3.6% in the Netherlands. In general,
 
the 
consumer goods, manufacturing
,
 
and recreation and travel sectors
 
are more affected 
by the COVID
-
19 crisis than the rest of the economy, while other sectors such as 
healthcare
, finance,
 
and software and IT services 
remain more insulated from the 
COVID
-
19 
shock.

The latest observation is for June 2020.The hiring rate at the industry level is available at a monthly frequency. The

specific monthly hiring rates are 
calculated as the percentage of 
LinkedIn
 
members who started a job

industry 
hiring rate 
indicato
r 
is presented in terms of its 
year
-
on
-
year growth rate
. Sectors with negative values observe larger declines in their hiring rates than the remaining sectors, while 
sectors with positive values observe smaller declines in the hiring rate than the remainin
g sectors.
 
The hiring rate can proxy quite well for the aggregate job finding rate in the 
sample and can be used to nowcast the job finding rate during the crisis.
 
The 
LinkedIn
 
hiring rate encompasses both job
-
to
-
job transitions and transitions from 
unempl
oyment into employment and can be thought of as a proxy for the aggregate 
job finding rate.
48
 
To measure the empirical elasticity between the hiring rate and the 
job finding rate, a panel co
-
integration model is estimated across the five largest euro 
area countries from 2016 to 2019 in the spirit of 
Stock and Watson (1993)
 
and 
Pesaran 
and Smith (1995)
. Depending on the underlying estimation assumptions, the long
-
run 
elasticity is est
imated between 0.39 and 0.63, being always statistically significant.
49
 
With the 
LinkedIn
 
hiring rate available until June 2020, these elasticities can thus be 
used to construct the implied path of the aggregate job finding rate in 2020 during the 
COVID
-
19 
crisis (see Chart E, panel a).
 
A nowcasting of the unemployment rate during the COVID
-
19 crisis may be 
computed using the implied path of the aggregate job finding rate.
 
Using 
estimates of the inflow, 



 
and outflow rates, 



 
from unemployment, it is
 
possible to 
                                        
                           
 
48
 
 
In the remaining 
part 
of the analysis
,
 
we use the hiring rate instead of job postings
,
 
because the former is 
closer to the concept of
 
the
 
job finding rate.
 
For further details about the job finding rate and its historical 
relationship with labour market concepts such as th
e Beveridge curve and labour market tightness, refer 
to the article entitled 

The euro area labour market through the lens of
 
the Beveridge curve

, 
Economic 
Bulletin
, Issue 
4, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 2019. The job finding rate is estimated using the methodology 
in 
Shimer (2007)
 
and 
Elsby et al. (2013)
 
and using LFS data up to December 2019.
 
49
 
 
As a robustness exercise, we also estimate the elasticity between the hiring rate and the job finding rate 
across the individual countries. These country
-
spec
ific elasticities are somewhat more heterogeneous 
across countries, being around 0.12 and 0.17 for Germany, 0.37 and 0.51 for France, 0.26 and 0.52 for 
Italy, 0.73 and 0.85 for Spain, and between 0.71 and 0.80 for the Netherlands.

Similar to 
Shimer (2005)
, our simplified job flow approach does not explicitly account for flows in and out 
of the labour force. For a full description of this labour market model, see 
Pissarides (2000)
 
or Box 3 in 
the article entitled

finding rate in the five largest euro area countries is foreseen to peak around the 
beginning of Ma
y 2020 at 9.5%, driven by the large decline in job hires during the 
COVID
-
19 crisis. The gradual normalisation of the hiring rate suggests higher outflows 
from unemployment in May and June 2020, but with the unemployment rate still 
remaining higher than at
 
its pre
-
pandemic levels.
 
The dynamics of the nowcast 
unemployment rate also rest on the assumption that the job separation rate increased 
only moderately during the COVID
-
19 crisis.

nomy.
52
 
However, if recalls from 
temporary unemployment do not occur in full, a jump in the job separation rate may 
lead to a further deterioration in labour market conditions and to a higher 
unemployment rate than that nowcast in Chart E. Finally, when com
paring the nowcast 
unemployment rate with the actual unemployment rate, it should also be highlighted 
that the current relatively low unemployment figures stem partially from the fact that 
COVID
-
19 and related lockdown measures meant that people did not ac
tively search 
for work (e.g. due to limited job opportunities) or were not available for work at short 
notice (e.g. due to childcare obligations or care of the elderly). They are, hence, 
classified as being outside of the labour force and do not count as u
nemployed 
according to the ILO definition of unemployment.

that observed during the average quarter in the

Recent develo
pments in euro area food prices
 
Prepared by Ieva Rubene
 
Food prices can be an important driver of
 
euro area headline HICP inflation
, as 
food accounts for almost 20% of the HICP consumption basket and food price 
inflation is highly volatile.
 
In 
the second quarter of
 
2020 the contribution of food to 
HICP inflation was 
around 
two
-
thirds of a percentage p
oint
, making it
 
larger than 
the 
contribution
 
of services or non
-
energy industrial goods. As food items are also a 
prominent example of frequently purchased out
-
of
-
pocket goods, their price 
movements are generally thought to have an important bearing on con

perception of inflation. Against this background, this box reviews recent developments 
in euro area food prices in an environment that has been affected by the 
coronavirus 
(
COVID
-
19
)
 
pandemic.
 
The April 2020 surge in euro area food prices was stron
g even in 
the light
 
of 
food prices
 
having been volatile in the past
.
 
The month
-
on
-
month increase in 
total 
food prices reached an exceptional 1.1%
 
in April,
 
a rate almost never observed since 
1999 (excluding the few temporary 
large 
hikes due to changes in i
ndirect taxes).
54
 
The 
only other increase of 
a 
similar magnitude was in January 2002
,
 
when 
the 
euro cash 
changeover took place. 
As
 
food prices
 
are highly seasonal, especially for 
unprocessed food, 
changes in a given month should be compared with the same 
mo
nth 
in
 
other years. Comparing the month
-
on
-
month change in April 2020 with the 
previous three years reveals that 
the April 2020 change
 
was exceptional, especially 
for unprocessed food (see Chart A).
55
 
The more detailed product breakdown shows 
that
,
 
within t
he unprocessed food component, this exceptional increase was observed 
mainly in prices for vegetables, 
and
 
to a slightly lesser extent also in prices for fresh 
fruit and fish. Although the increase was less pronounced for overall processed food 
prices, it 
was clearly higher for 
certain
 
items such as bread, pasta and other flour 
products, as well as meat.
56
 
Month
-
on
-
month price changes in May 
and possibly also 
June 
signal some unwinding of the 
food 
price increases observed in April
 
for 
vegetables, fresh fish
,
 
and bread
,
 
pasta
 
and other flour products
. Price increases 
for
 
processed meat 
eased
, while prices for fresh fruit continued to increase 
fairly quickly
.
 
The preliminary data for June signal a further easing in food price pressures, although 
a detailed brea
kdown is not yet available. As a result, annual inflation for unprocessed 
fo
od decreased to 
5.9
% 
in June from the peak of 7.6% in April.
 
The inflation rate for 
processed food excluding tobacco was 1.8% in May
 
(unchanged from April)
, 
whereas
 
                                        
                           
 
54
 
 
In some countries the HICP 
for 
food in April 
was also less reliably compiled than usual
 
as a large share of 
miss
ing prices 
had to be inferred. For instance, in the French HICP for 
food
 
in April, 
price changes were 
imputed (i.e. replaced), for example by referring to scanner data, for 
small shops
, outdoor 
market
s
 
and 
shops whose prices 
were
 
not available online
. More
 
generally, to impute prices that could not be 
collected, online prices
 
were used if available and product replacement was more frequent than usual.
 
55
 
 
The changeover to a more granular HICP classification (ECOICOP
-
5) in January 2019 affected the split 
between processed and unprocessed food as of January 2017. As a result, the relative share of 
processed food in total food increased from around 60% to 75%, making it inappropriate to compare 
monthly changes with the years prior to 2017. For more informati
on, see

Price increases for meat products (both processed and unprocessed) since the middle of 2019 have 
been somewhat higher than over the preceding few years, partly due to strong demand from China, 
whose own supply of pork 
has decreased due to African swine fever. As a result, the EU, which is the

At the time this box was finalised, a detailed breakdown

Strong month
-
on
-
month changes in food prices can have many different 
cause
s
.
 
Usually
,
 
these changes
 
are due to the seasonal nature of supply (in particular 
for unprocessed food) and the sensitivity of food prices (both processed and 
unprocessed) to local and global 
hygiene
 
(animal disease) 
or 
weather
-
related shocks. 
C
hanges in i
ndirect taxes can 
also sometimes 
have noticeable effects. However, the 
April 2020 surge was extraordinary and likely reflected upward pressure
s
 
related to 
the specific circumstances of the C
OVID
-
19 pandemic. These circumstances include 
the fact that
,
 
during the lockdown period
,
 
households prepared more meals at home 
and 
thus
 
diverted
 
some demand for food 
away from
 
restaurants and catering services 
and 
to
wards
 
home consumption. Stockpiling in anticipation of lockdown restrictions 
may have been another 
reason why
 
household demand for food
 
was stronger than 
usual
, 
al
though 
this argument applies 
only
 
for 
processed food products
 
that can be 
stored
. Stronger
-
than
-
usual demand and 
the impact of
 
stockpiling is evident in the 
surge in retail sales volumes for f
ood in March, when the annual rate of change for the 
 
ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 5 / 2020
 

 
Boxes
 
Recent
 
developments in euro area food prices
 
 
65
 
euro area jumped to a historical high
 
of
 
9.1
%, preceding the April price surge. In April, 
the annual growth rate in retail sales volumes slowed to 2.0%, before increasing again 
to 4.9% in May.
 
Developmen
ts in April 2020 most likely reflected strong increases in demand 
combined with supply
-
side effects related to the lockdown and containment 
measures.
 
For instance, the surge in prices, especially for vegetables, likely reflected 
supply difficulties due to 
harvesting and transportation delays. Such delays may have 
increased the relative supply of (often more expensive) local products. More generally, 
producers and retailers faced cost increases due to 
mandatory
 
hygien
e
 
measures and 
the repackaging of bulk 
vo
lumes
 
usually sold to businesses into smaller 
volumes
 
for 
households. Repackaging takes time and thus may also have 
exacerbated
 
the 
temporary supply shortage. 
It is also possible that consumers expressed
 
a stronger 
preference for packaged fresh food (likel
y more expensive than unpackaged products) 
due to
 
the fear of 
contracting
 
the virus 
through
 
direct contact
 
with a product
.
57
 
In 
addition, and especially for processed food products, in a number of cases the price 
increases recorded in the HICP may have also
 
reflected the cancellation of 
promotion
al
 
activities
 
rather than outright price increases.
 
The potential supply
-
side impacts can be assessed by looking at the cost and 
input structures of food production.
 
Food production in the euro area is 
characterised 
by strong supply linkages
 
within the sector
. According to the euro area 
input
-
output table, the main input for the manufacturing output of 
the 
food sector is 
domestic processed and unprocessed food products (approximately 40% of all 
inputs). For example, f
ood is needed to feed animals and flour is needed to make 
bread. 
F
ood products
 
imported 
from outside the euro area only 
make up 
a small share 
of 
the 
food sector

 
production costs (around 5%).
58
 
At the same time, around 
10% of 
the processed 
food produ
cts, beverages and tobacco products 
consumed by 
households 
are imported directly from 
countries 
outside the euro area
,
 
and the 
corresponding share for fresh food (including fish products)
 
is higher, at 
around 20%.
59
 
Overall, this suggests that the disruption of supply chains within 
the 
euro area, 
including distribution networks, 
that has been 
observed during 
the 
C
OVID
-
19 
pandemic may have had important implications for the food supply and, 
therefore
, 
prices.
 
Supply c
hains within the euro area are very important. Those 
involving
 
the 
other EU countries and countries outside the EU
, while generally less 
important,
 
may
 
still
 
be important for specific products.
 
Detailed sectoral data for 
euro area imports do not provide th
e breakdown of food imports used for domestic 
production and 
food imports delivered directly
 
to shops for household consumption. 
Nevertheless, 
data on 
total food imports can provide some information 
on which
 
food 
products
 
are
 
potentially more sensitive to 
supply chain disruptions. Eurostat trade data 
                                        
                           
 
57
 
 
While the general rule when compiling the HICP is to maintain fixed outlet and product types, the 
collecti
on difficulties due to COVID
-
19 lockdowns implied a less stable structure of outlets and products, 
as a result of imputations that were necessary when some prices could not be collected
.
 
58
 
 
These estimates are based on the euro area input

output table for 
2018 provided by Eurostat.

and related services, as well as fish, other fishing products, aquaculture products and support services

product classification is not fully consistent with the HICP unprocessed food item.
 
 
ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 5 / 2020
 

 
Boxes
 
Recent
 
developments in euro area food prices
 
 
66
 
for 2019 show that around 40% of food imports 
from outside the euro area 
were from 
the other
 
EU countries (including the U
nited 
K
ingdom
). However, 
there is also 
substantial 
trade 
in
 
food products 
within 
the eur
o area. For many product groups, 
such 
as
 
dairy, beverages, meat and vegetables, imports 
from euro area countries 
significantly exceed 
imports
 
from 
both 
the rest of the EU and 
from 
countries outside 
the EU (see Chart B). The particularly strong price increa
ses for vegetables in April 
could thus reflect the bottlenecks in production and shipping from the 
s
outh to the 
n
orth of Europe. In May price increases for vegetables somewhat normalised
,
 
suggesting that 
the 
bottlenecks in 
s
outh
ern
 
Europe may have eased. T
his easing 
should also have softened price pressures for fresh fruit, 
but these prices 
continued to 
increase at a somewhat higher pace in May 2020 than in the same month in previous 
years. Given the siz
eable
 
imports of fresh fruit
,
 
not only from the euro a
rea but also 
from countries outside the EU, these higher price increases in May 
could
 
partly reflect 
the 
disruption 
to
 
global supply chains 
in
 
countries outside the EU as a result of 
the
 
C
OVID
-
19 pandemic.

Overall, the 
food 
price increases in April were unusually strong and reflected an 
unprecedented 
combination
 
of demand and supply influences.
 
However, 
the 
HICP for food in May 
and June 
signalled signs of normalisation in price changes as 
lockdowns ease

and activity resume
d
. There 
may
 
still be some upside price 
pressures in the near term due to potent
ial shortages of seasonal workers or 
increased hygien

costs for business
es
. In the medium term, however, if the increase 
in unemployment 
is long

lasting
 
there could be some downside pressures, especially 
for processed food, 
due to
 
constrained household

term loans and financing needs for fixed 
investment offer valuable and timely information on a

variables.
 
Empirical evidence shows that qualitative 
indications 
from banks 
on 

loan demand
 
generally correlate well with actual developments in eco
nomic variables 
(
see 
Chart A
). In particular, there is a close relationship between the maturity of the 
loan,
63
 
the drivers of loan demand and the purpose for which the loan is intended to be 
used. For example, demand for short
-
term loans according to the B
LS and the 
associated financing needs for working capital correlate well with actual developments 
in inventories. By the same token, long
-
term l
oan demand and

This reflects either a reduction or

A comparison across firm sizes shows that the shift in the drivers of loan 
demand was more pronounced for s
mall and medium

sized enterprises (SMEs)
, 
which 
have 
benefited 
substantially
 
from
 
policy support measures 
for bank 
lending during the pandemic
.
 
Loan demand increased more strongly for SMEs than 
for large firms in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting their greater
 
dependence on 
banks for financing and 
emergency liquidity needs
 
(see Chart C, panel (a)). At the
 
same time, their high demand for loans has been met by banks at very low lending 
rates. In particular, at the euro area level, t
he 
difference between 
interest rates 
charged on very small 
loans (a proxy for loans to SMEs) and those charged on
 
large 
loans 
h
as narrowed in recent months (see Chart C, panel (b)). This suggests that 
SMEs have benefited substantially from recent monetary policy measures supporting 
banks, such as the TLTRO III operations
69
, as well as from state loan guarantees, 
which are typically
 
targeted to this specific group of firms.

manufacturing sector,

By contrast, 
loan demand increased less in the

the

Introduction

motivates the need to examine them closely from 
a monetary policy perspective
.
 
First,
 
because of their marked pro

cyclicality, 
durables 
can 
help
 
in tracking 

 
and possibly anticipating 

 
the state of the business 
cycle in the euro area, thus complementing

components, such as investment.
73
 
Second,
 
expenditure on durables can help us 
better understand 
cross
-
country heterogeneity 
in terms of consumption and saving 
habits, as well as
 
its drivers
. Third, since purchases 
of durables can be financed using 
credit, the behaviour of durable goods provides important insights into 
the state of 
financing conditions
 
in the economy.
 
E
xpenditure 
on d
urable
 
goods
 
is a key component 
of consumption dynamics
,
 
d
espite 
accounting for a 
modest share in aggregate household spending
.
 
In the 
two years preceding the coronavirus (COVID

19) pandemic that has affected the 
European and global economies, a
nnual 
growth in euro area 
consumption moderated 
from the solid rates of expansion observed in
 
2015
-
17, partly 
owing
 
to a 
decline
 
in 
spending on durable goods
 
(see Chart 1)
.
 
Specifically, h
aving 
provided strong 
support 
to 
the earlier phases of the latest expansion, 
durables
 
accounted for 
almost one

third
 
of the overall loss

ve
 
specific characteristics 
that 
set 
them
 
apart from 
other 
consumption expenditure items
.
 
First, a durable good provides utility 
over multiple 
periods and (
like
 
capital) is subject to depreciation. This allows consumers to 
postpone purchases in times of economic hardship, while still benefiting from the flow 
of services from the accumulated stock, and 
to
 
adjust to the desired 
level
 
of durables 
once the economy has recovered.
75
 
Secondly, 
the purchase of 
durables can often be 
financed 
using
 
credit and 
the durables are
 
sometimes 
eligible for use
 
as collateral, 
which can make them more exposed to credit condit
ions and lending rates than 
n

s
.
76
 
Finally, changes in the stock of durables may be subject to 
adjustment costs. This could lead to sluggish and protracted cycles in durable

Consumer durables are defined in the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010) as durable goods 
used by households for final consumption repeatedly over 
a 
period of more than one year. In the

Behaviour and characteristics of durable goods consumption
 
2.1
 
Cyclical behaviour of durables
 
Expenditure on 
durable
s tends to be volatile 
and 
pro
-
cyclical, reflecting the 
specific characteristics of this type of good.
 
As
 
shown in Chart 2, the dynamics of 
year
-
on
-
year durable goods consumption exhibit ample fluctuations, with growth 
typically excee
ding GDP (and non
-
durable goods consumption) in times of economic 
expansion and contracting more strongly during recessions. The pro
-
cyclicality of 
expenditure on durable goods was particularly pronounced in Italy and Spain during 
the European sovereign de
bt crisis. The counter
-
cyclical behaviour in Germany during 
the crisis period was affected by the cars component, which benefited from subsidies 
in the form of vehicle scrappage schemes that were larger than in the other euro area 
countries and proved to b
e rather effective.
80
 
Moreover, the household sector in 
Germany was more resilient than in other large euro area countries.

By contrast, in France, Italy a

contribute to
 
a larger

GDP growth relative to their size.
 
From 
that perspective, expenditure on durables bears some resemblance to the 
characteristics of investment, which, despite its smaller size in aggregate demand, 
accounts for
 
a disproportionately large share of output fluctuations.

Turning point analysis
 
Turning point analyses focus on identifying time periods in which 
an economy 
switches from one regime to another, for instance from a phase of expansion to 
a phase of contraction, and vice versa
.
 
In this section, results for the euro area are 
shown based on two different approaches for defining a recession. One approach 
is 
based on the official business cycle dating methodology used by the 
Euro Area 
Business Cycle Dating Committee of 
the Centre for Economic Policy 
Research 
(CEPR)
.
81
 
The other is a modified version for quarterly data by 
Harding and Pagan 
(2002)
 
of the origi
nal Bry and 
Boschan 
(1971) dating algorithm (hereafter MBBQ 
algorithm).
82
 
This algorithm is a multi
-
step, automated method to identify turning 
points on the basis of assumptions about the relative size of peaks and troughs and 
the minimum duration of the di
fferent phases of the business cycle.
 
Recession
s in the euro area,
 
based on CEPR official dating
,
 
tend to coincide 
with downturns in 
both 
GDP and 
most 
expenditure components
, including 
durable goods consumption
.
 
Chart 3 shows CEPR recessions in the euro ar
ea 
(
grey vertical bars
 
delineated by black borders)
 
alongside downturns 
in 
GDP and 
expenditure components identified 
on the basis of 
the MBBQ algorithm 
(coloured 
bars)
.
 
The fact that recession periods tend to coincide with clusters of identified 
downturns 
for most GDP expenditure components is in line with the notion that a 
recession is a generalised phenomenon spread across the whole economy. At the 
same time, the decline in durable goods expenditure around downturns in the broader 
economy signals that pur
chases of durables are highly synchronised with 
developments in activity and thus carry important information about the phase of the 
business cycle.

The CEPR approach 
defines a recessi

growth in GDP, employment and other measures of aggregate economic activity for the

The latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
Aside from downturns coinciding with official 
recession
s, turning points in 
durables have also occurred historically outside recessions but during periods 
typically 
characterised by economic weakness
.
 
One
 
s
uch 
occurrence

instance, 
was 
in the early 2000s

coming from the most volatile co
mponents of GDP cautions against over

Another interesting observation is that the 
identified 
downturn
s
 
in durable 
consumption have 
tended to 
anticipat
e 
the 
official 
start of the 
two

s
 
in

dated by the CEPR
.
 
While the limited recession episodes in the euro 
area 
invite caution against
 
draw
ing
 
strong conclusions
, t
his 
leading feature in durable 
goods expenditure is also 
evident in the
 
longer sample for the United States
,
 
which 
stretches over 
six decades
,
 
thereby
 
capturing a larger number of 
recessions
 
(see 
Chart 4)
. 
As with the euro area
, the 
evidence from the United States also seems to 
suggest that the 
signal provided by durables reg
arding the 
change of 
phase 
in
 
the 
business cycle tends to be less noisy than the one based on investment components
.
 
A
t the same time
,
 
it appears 
more consistent 
in signalling shifts between economic 
regimes 
than other consumption items such as services, which often do not 
exhibit 
turning points during 
official 
recessions.

Durable consumption, credit and financing condi
tions
 

over the business cycle
.
 
Financing
 
conditions are particularly relevant for the 
purchase of big
-
ticket items such as durables, which, because of their longer lifespan 
and 
higher unit value, are more often acquired with credit and are sometimes eligible 
for use 
as collateral
 
to secure the underlying credit claim.

Box 2 provides further 
details on the use of credit for durable goods purchases in the euro area.
 
Box

The use 
of credit for durable 
goods 
purchases in the euro area
 
Prepared by Matteo Falagiarda and Mika Tujula
 
A large share of purchases of durable goods in the euro area is financed via credit.
86
 
This feature 
makes durable goods more exposed to credit conditions and monetary policy than non
-
durable 
goods. In the euro area as a whole, the relevance of consumer credit for purchases of durable goods 
declined markedly in the wake of the global financi
al crisis but has recovered since 2015 (see panel 
(a) in Chart A). While about 60% of the purchases of durable goods were financed 
using
 
credit in the 
pre
-
crisis period, the share declined to around 40% in the period 2008
-
14 before increasing to almost 
50%
 
in the most recent period. From a country perspective, a similar pattern can be observed in 
Germany and Spain, where the bulk of 

durable goods purchase

crisis period 
                                        
                           
 
85
 
 
Notwithstanding the importance of consumer credit
 
in financing the consumption of durable goods (see 
Box 2), mortgages associated with the acquisition of housing still account for a larger share of household 
debt.
 
86
 
 
Credit 
for consumption refers to 
loans granted for mainly personal use 
for the purchase
 
of goods and 
services.
 
It should be noted that r
evolving loans, overdrafts and credit card debt
 
are covered by 
consumer credit in the case of outstanding amounts in MFI balance sheet statistics, while in the case of 
new business volumes they are excluded f
rom

Consumption
 
of durable goods in the euro area

was
 
financed with credit. In Germany, the decline observed after 
2007 can be attributed to a decrease 
in the share of cars to total durable purchases and, in 2009
-
10, also to the vehicle scrappage scheme, 
which reduced the amount of credit needed to purchase a car. In Spain, the decline in the share of 
durables financed
 
via credit can be explained by the strong deleveraging of the household sector and 
high unemployment rates observed after the global financial crisis. In France and Italy, credit is 
currently supporting purchases of durable goods to a higher extent than i
n the past, although in Italy it 
remains at a relatively moderate level, owing to the lower share of cars to total durable purchases in 
comparison with the other countries.

Consumer credit has supported

during
 
the latest recovery.
 
Movements in new business volumes in consumer credit have generally followed changes in 
consumption expenditure on durable goods very closely (see panel (b) in Chart A). The correlation 
between durable goods consumption and new business volumes in consume
r credit from the first 
quarter of 2004 to the fourth quarter of 2019 is around 0.75. This strong link is also confirmed by the

contributor to the demand for
 
consumer credit. This robust relationship is also driven by the fact that 
durable goods, particularly cars, may serve as collateral to back the corresponding credit claims. 
Since 2014, the increasing demand for durable goods and for consumer credit to fin
ance them has 
been supported by a return of confidence among households following the broad
-
based recovery in 
the economy and the improved labour market situation, as well as by record low bank lending rates 
(see panel (a) in

intensified in early 2020, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

digit rates in annual terms and was the only private sector loan component to display a 
positive annual growth rate between 2015 and 2017. These robust dynamics should, however, be 
seen against the background of the strong and protracted decline 
in bank credit that took place during 
the euro area financial and sovereign debt crises and the subsequent strong pent

pressures. In Italy, consumer credit accounted for half of the annual growth in total MFI loans to

19. By contrast, the annual growth rates of consumer credit 
remained relatively moderate in Germany and France. Focusing on the most recent period, the 
growth of credit for consumption moderated in all large euro area countries, in line with the weaken
ing 
economic environment. This moderation was particularly pronounced in Spain, as strong pent

up 
demand pressures following the crisis have been gradually reabsorbed. A sharp decline in consumer 
credit dynamics was observed in early 2020 across all large 
euro area countries, as a result of the 
lockdown measures introduced following the coronavirus outbreak.
 
 
As a result, durables correlate 
closely
 
with demand for consumer credit and 
can provide important insight
s
 
into
 
the state of financing conditions in t
he 
economy.
 
As
 
shown in Chart 5, phases of sustained growth in durable goods 
consumption, such as during the period of expansion prior to the global financial crisis 
or the more recent one in 2013
-
19, tend to coincide with increases in demand for 
consumer 
loans typically used by households to finance purchases of durables. 
Likewise, the close co
-
movement between durables and demand for credit was 
present during the double
-
dip recessions in the euro area. Moreover, during the global 
financial crisis in 2008
-
09, the tightening of credit standards by banks restricted the 
availability of credit from the supply side and coincided with a significant contraction in 
durable goods purchases.

stagnated and credit contracted in the euro area as a whole during the first period, these 
developments 

 
in the form of a sharp contraction 

 
were particularly evide

By contrast, in the second period starting in 2013, as credit availability improved and the

with the support of policy measures, both credit growth and durable goods expenditure

and to regulatory 
changes 
and 
technolog

.
 
For instance, the rebound in car purchases in 
2009, in the middle of the financial crisis, was bolstered by the wide

spread 
i
mplementation of subsidies for vehicle scrappage schemes across the euro area, 
ranging from 

1,000 per car in France to 

2,500 per car in Germany.

The car

recovery in durables during the recession proved to be short

mostly brou
ght forward future demand.
 
In the course of the latest expansion, expenditure on cars has provided a major 
impetus to the sustained growth in durables amid supportive financing

During this period, favourable funding conditions are likely to have supported

While cars may depreciate faster than some durables, such as furniture, they depreciate much more 
slowly than other items, such as computers. See Stacchetti, E.

Using micro data, Box 3 investigates the heterogeneity across households 
in car purchases and the use of car loans during the recovery. In the past two years 
(2018
-
19), expenditure on cars experienced a slowdown amid substantial volatilit
y, in 
part related to changes in environmental regulations and uncertain prospects about both 
the future use of diesel combustion engines and the speed of diffusion of electric cars.

Household heterogeneity in vehicle purchases
 
Prepared by 
Fabian Ne
meczek, Francisco Rodrigues and Jiri Slacalek
 
Vehicles, such as cars, trucks and motorcycles, are an important component of durable goods.
 
They 
make up about 40
%
 
of durable 
goods 
consumption at the aggregate level and account for much of its 
cyclical varia
tion. Aggregate purchases of vehicles (
hereafter
 

experienced buoyant dynamics in recent years. Aggregate figures, however, may hide 
considerable
 
heterogeneity across the population. If, for example, only the wealthie
st households were responsible 
for the aggregate increase in car purchases, 
it
 
would be a sign of fragility 
in
 
the growth in durable 
goods 
consumption. Moreover, car purchases often require a loan. The distribution of loans for car 
purchase can also provid
e useful information on macroeconomic and financial conditions.
 
This box investigates heterogeneity across euro area households in car purchases and in loans for 
the purchase of cars during the recovery following the European sovereign debt crisis.
 
We make
 
use 
of the 

Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), which is a unique source 
of cross
-
country comparable household
-
level data on balance sheets, income and consumption 

penditure on, and loans for, 
vehicle purchases. The HFCS is a triennial survey, so this box focuses on the two waves conducted in 
2014 and 2017. Information on car purchases is available with reference to the year before the survey 
interviews, i.e. 2013 an
d 2016 respectively.
93
 
A general feature emerging from the micro data is that households with higher levels of income tend 
to buy more expensive cars and to change them more often. 
Chart A shows how the share of 
households who bought a new or used 
car
 
in th
e year preceding the survey (panel (a) of Chart A) and 
the median value paid (panel (b) of Chart A) are distributed across quintiles of gross household 
income. The amount paid 
for
 
purchase
, as given
 
in panel (b)
,
 
refers to purchases of both new and 
used 
ca
rs
, net of anything received for trading in or selling an 
older
 
model
.
94
 
Both measures clearly 
increase
 
in

income in

tend to 
buy 
cars

The HFCS data cannot be directly compared with most other data sources because those sources do not

buying a car grew by between 1.5 and 3.1 percentage points and the median value of the car grew 
within a range of 

400 and 

2,100. Similar increases were recorded across other socio

aphic 
dimensions, such as age, education and employment status.
 
The increases in 
car
 
purchases were sizable throughout the income distribution, including 
the
 
lower 
and middle 
segments
. While
 
in the lowest income quintile the share of households buying a car rose 
by about 60%, in the middle quintile it increased by about 20% and in the top quintile by 8%. This may 
reflect the fact that durable goods, including cars, are particularly pro

cyclic
al. During a recession, 
households tend to postpone the purchase of durables and instead spend on necessities.

pattern is particularly pronounced in the case of poorer households, who are more subject to 
unemployment risk and have less liquid assets 
to smooth their spending.
 
Lower uncertainty spurs 
car
 
purchases. A durable good provides households with a stream of 
services throughout its lifetime. Purchasing a durable
 
good is therefore a decision to allocate present 
and future savings to current and f
uture consumption, and as such, households 
that are 
less certain 
of what their future income 
will 
be have 
fewer
 
incentives to do so. 
Declining uncertainty, lower 
unemployment and more optimistic prospects about future economic developments likely contribut
ed 
to increasing 
numbers of 
car purchases, especially in the lower 
segments
 
of the income distribution 
(see panel (a) of Chart A
).
 
The size of loans stipulated for car purchases also increases in the income distribution.
 
Furthermore, 
c
ar loans tend to incr
ease with income (panel (d) of Chart A). However, the share of households 
holding car loans increas
es
 
up to the fourth income quintile, 
before falling
 
slightly for the fifth quintile 
(panel (c) of Chart A)
.
 
While the share of households holding loans for 
c
ar
 
purchases remained roughly stable between 
201
4
 
and 201
7
, the balance of these loans increased across the income distribution.
 
The share of 
households holding loans 
for 
purchase
s
 
decreased slightly for most income quintiles (panel
 
(
c
) of 
Chart A); the di
fference between the two years did not exceed 1.5 percentage points. At the same 
time, the median value of 
loans funding purchases
 
(panel (d) of Chart A)
 
grew by between 

900 and 

2,000
 
throughout the income distribution. In percentage terms, the strongest
 
increase was recorded 
among households in the lowest quintile. This increase in the 
median value of loans funding 
car
 
purchases
 
for lower income households may reflect their more 
optimistic expectations about the 
economy and less binding credit constraint
s.
 
Car
 
purchases increased more strongly for households with few net liquid assets. 
This fact suggests 
that a precautionary saving motive may have been an important factor dampening durable 
goods 
spending during the Great Recession. 
As with
 
income risk, 
du
rable goods consumption is also 
influenced by 
how well households are insured against shocks in terms of net liquid assets
. 
In line 
with economic models, households with low buffers of liquid assets tend to postpone purchases of 
durables during recessions 
and buy cars during the recovery when their economic outlook is more 
optimistic. Additional calculations document that households with few net liquid assets relative to their 
income 

 
especially those exposed to risk, suc
h as those with lower incomes 

 
expanded their 
car
 
purchases more strongly
.
 
Looking ahead
, in the near future,
 
purchases of cars will decline because of the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
In the short run, many households will put off their spending on 
cars because 
the supply 
has been severely c
urtailed 
owing to
 
containment measures and
 
because
 
of
 
adverse
 
shocks to 
incomes, as well as rising economic and financial uncertainty. Over the medium run, the future 
recovery in consumer durables could be supported by the postponed pent
-
up demand and a po
ssible 

 
However, this effect could be 
tempered by the fact that the pandemic shock will disproportionately affect younger households. 
These households 
account for a substantial part of car pu
rchases 
and they are also likely to be 
particularly exposed to declines in income and rising uncertainty.

Relative prices and relative consumption of durables
 
Over the long run the relative price of durables exhibits a sustained downward 
trend
.
 
The rela
tive price, as measured by the ratio between the consumption deflators 
of durables and non
-
durables (the latter including semi
-
durables and services), has 
declined by almost 40% in the euro area since 1999 (see Chart 8)
.
 
The increase in the 
affordability o
f durables has benefited from globalisation trends
 
and has been 
observed also in other advanced economies, such as the United States, the United 
Kingdom and Japan. Since the mid
-
1990s, globalisation has increasingly allowed 
firms to source low
-
cost imports
 
of consumer goods from new locations in emerging 
markets and to move production capacities to such destinations.
96
 
In addition, rapid 
technological advances have lead to a constant decline in prices for durable goods 
items such as electronics, while posing
 
challenges to quality adjustments in the 
statistical measurement of price changes. Box 4 sheds light on the importance of 
durable goods for HICP inflation in the euro area.

The impact of durable

Prepared by Luigi Ferrara
 
Durable goods prices have not provided support to euro area inflation developments over the past 
two decades. Their contribution to headline and underlying inflation has
,
 
on average
,
 
been zero (see 
Chart
 
A). This reflects
 
a slightly negative rate of inflation 

 
about 
-
0.1% on average since 1999 

 
and
 
the relatively small weight of durable goods 
in 
the HICP basket

While durable goods inflation 
has seen
 
a flat trend, it 
has 
also displayed a fair degree of cyclicality. A 
granular
 
analysis suggests that specific items have contributed to both features. Chart B decompose
s 
developments in durable goods prices into six major items: cars, furniture, household appliances, 
computers
,
 
telephones and others. Prices for computers have declined, on average, by 10% and 
have not seen a positive annual rate of change since 1999. More
over, the volatility of the negative 
annual rates of change has been substantial, as documented by a standard deviation of almost 6 
percentage points. 
The same can be said of
 
telephone prices.
98
 
Appliances 
has 
also recorded
,
 
on 
average
,
 
a negative inflation
 
rate, 
albeit
 
smaller and much less volatile. By contrast, 
cars and furniture 
have
,
 
on average
,
 
seen positive inflation rates with volatilities much lower than for computers and 
telephones. Accounting for more than half of the weight of durables, they shap
e the trend and 
volatility of the HICP durable goods aggregate. 
If computers and telephones were excluded from 
durable goods, the average durable goods inflation rate over the 
past
 
two decades 
would have been 
slightly positive.

thus includes the changes due to 
the transition to 
the 
COICOP5 breakdown.
 
The diverse inflation developments across durable goods items suggest that there may be 
i
diosyncratic factors driving them. For
 
instance, the high degree of technological progress since the 
late 1990s is likely to have been particularly prevalent for computers. In the HICP statistics
,
 
such 
progress is considered as an improvement in product qu
ality and, hence, does not reflect a pure price 
change. Purchasing a new computer with more processing power than the one to be replaced 
therefore implies a decline in the price recorded in the HICP statistics. Similar 
adjustments for quality 
improvements,
 
although not to the same extent, are also applied to car prices.
99
 
This factor has 
contributed to the relatively muted average inflation rate of durable goods 
over
 
the past two decades.
 
Idiosyncratic factors can make it more difficult to discern the relati
onship between durable goods 
inflation and regular demand and cost factors. For instance, 
from a
 
demand
 
perspective
, durable 
goods inflation tends to co
-
move with private consumption growth. 
From a
 
cost factor
 
perspective
, 
durable goods inflation exhibits 
a negative correlation with unit labour cost growth, which comes from 
a strong positive association with productivity growth rather than with 
wage developments
. Although 
these aggregate indicators are only crude proxies for sector
-
specific demand and cost 
conditions for 

changes in the cycle and profits adjust to demand and cost shocks.
 
Developments in global sourcing 
and production are also relevant for 
dur
able goods inflation. 
For non
-
energy industrial goods as a 
whole
,
 
the direct and indirect import contents rose from 20% in 2000 to slightly above 25% in 2014.
100
 
The shares f
or durable goods 
are
 
likely to be 
similar.
 
 
                                        
                           
 
99
 
 
The 
HICP methodology requires actual price changes 
to be
 
adjusted for quality improvements. This is a 
difficult task, in particular for products whose quality changes rapidly and often substantially over time. 
With a view to
 
providing comparable results, HICPs 
for
 
euro area 
countries
 
are designed to present 
harmonised results
,
 
while the statistical tools and methods used to 
produce these results may vary.

of durable goods in the euro area

Over time, the decline in relative price
s has coincided with a rise in real durable 
consumption relative to other items
.
 
As evident in Chart 8, favourable price 
developments have contributed to an increase in the share of durables in total 
consumption in real terms, despite a modest decline in t
he corresponding nominal 
share. Moreover, panel (a) in Chart 9
 
shows the common nature of this phenomenon
 
being observed 
over the long run
,
 
not only for the euro area as a whole but also across 
its four largest economies. 
At business cycle frequency, 
however, 
relative durable 
consumption can respond to country
-
specific economic conditions, being affected by 
pent
-
up demand and catch
-
up effects
. Panel
 
(b) highlights that,
 
even though relative 
prices continue to decline during 
weak phases of the business 
cycle, 
sometimes 
consumers fail to take advantage of favourable price conditions. For instance, 
in Italy 
and Spain during 
the period 
2008
-
12, 
other factors such as 
declining disposable 
income and 
increasing unemployment hindered consumption more broadly. T
he 
postponement of purchases of big
-
ticket items in the middle of the protracted 
recessionary phase led to an 
age
ing stock of durables generating 
pent
-
up demand.

The underlying idea is that overall consumption is better

led by 
treating
 
expenditure 
on 
durable
s
 
and non
-
durable
s
 
separately
,
 
given 
their 
asynchronous 
adjustment,
 
as well as the possibility of
 
spillovers from durable
-
specific 
shocks 
to non
-
durable consumption in the presence of liquidity constraints.
103
 
The 
model uses five variables,
 
volumes and prices of durable and non
-
durable 
consumption and the nominal interest r
ate on consumer credit.
 
To interpret the 
evolution of consumption in terms of fundamental drivers,
 
five structural drivers are 
identified: durable goods
-
specific demand and supply, aggregate (approximated by 
non
-
durables) demand and supply, and broad monet
ary conditions capturing both
 
monetary policy
 
and the credit environment
. The identification relies on a mix of zero 
and sign restrictions as informed by a theoretical model. 
The VAR model 
has 
time
-
varying
 
parameters 
and 
is estimated with Bayesian techniqu
es.
 
The methodology allows 
consumption 
to be decomposed into 
contribution
s
 
from 
structural shocks.
 
Chart 10 presents a historical decomposition of overall 
consumption and of durable goods consumption growth in the euro area. Focusing on 
overall consumption
, the results in panel (a) suggest that, against the background of 
prevailing negative aggregate supply shocks between 2008 and 2013, 
the main 
cyclical drivers 
of 
consumption in both the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis 
were 
demand
-
side
 
facto
rs, as their contribution triggered both downturns throughout 
the episodes of the crises, as well as the brief recovery phase in between. The 
negative effects from demand factors were compounded by unfavourable monetary 
conditions during the financial cris
is.
104
 
The model assigns a strong positive role in the 
initial years of the 
recovery
,
 
which started 
in 2014
, to aggregate supply
-
side shocks. 
These shocks captured, together with other factors, a positive impact from 
very low 
energy prices
, as they coincided
 
with an 
unexpected drop in oil prices 
that gave
 
a 

 
and thereby supported 
consumption expenditure.
105
 
T
he slowdown in consumption growth since 2018 can be 
explained by a combination of demand and su
pply shocks
,
 
t
he latter 
possibly 
capturing the 
adverse effects on consumer purchasing power from r
ising energy 
prices since 2017.

As noted earlier, 
monetary conditions 
in this case 
encompass both monetary policy and the 
broader

. Interestingly, the finding of a negative contribution from monetary conditions in 2009 
corroborates the evidence of a tightening in credit supply as shown in Chart 5.

Conclusions
 
Focusing on longer

has explored 
the role played by 
durable goods as a cyclical driver of
 
euro area consumption
.
 
On the basis 
of the 
empirical
 
results, the slowdown during 2018
-
19, 
in comparison with
 
the buoyant 
dynamics in consumption during the earlier phases of the latest recovery, 
is best 
interpreted as a
 
normalisation following the dissip
ation of some favourable 
but 
transitory factors at play
 
in the preceding years
.
 
Looking 
ahead
, 
with
 
the 
spread
 
of 
the coronavirus having triggered a deep 
recession,
 
expenditure on durables 
is very likely to
 
contract 
severely 
in 2020 
owing to many shops clo
sing under lockdown
 
and 
household
s
 
postpon
ing
 
purchases of big
-
ticket items
.
 
In
 
the current environment of high uncertainty,
 
past 
experience highlights the
 
benefit
s
 
for 
economic analyses 
coming from the availability 
of durable goods expenditure 
data
 
and invites policymakers to monitor closely the 
behaviour of durables, as they can help track the health of the broader economy and 
provide clues about the path to recovery
.
 
If the pandemic crisis turns out to be 
temporary and financial amplification effe
cts can be contained, as expected, the delay 
in durable purchases in the short term may generate pent
-
up demand and bring 
catch
-
up effects later on, once economic conditions normalise. In a less favourable 
scenario, the rebound in durable consumption may b
e more muted as households 
readjust to a lower desired stock in view of lower long
-
run income expectations.

Introduction
 
Labour su
pply developments are a major 
determinant
 
of potential output
 
and 
are therefore also relevant for monetary policy
.
 
Labour supply developments in the 
euro area are strongly affected by population ageing, among other things.
106
 
Against 
this background
, 
it is c
rucial to have
 
a good understanding of 
how 
demographic 
changes
 
in
 
the various 
working
-
age 
cohorts, 
together with structural factors such as 
policy changes
,
 
will affect
 
the labour market
. Looking ahead, this understanding will be 
relevant when
 
assessing the potential growth outlook
, even though uncertainty has 
considerably increased recently due to the coronavirus (COVID
-
19) pandemic.
 
With the ageing of the baby boom generation, the population share of the older 
working
-
age cohort, i.e. those b
etween 55 and 74 years, has been gradually 
increasing.
 
This would suggest a decline in the overall labour force participation rate, 
given that the participation rate of these older workers has usually been considerably 
lower compared to other working
-
age 
c
ohorts.
107
 
However, this is not what we have 
observed during the past two decades. Instead, most euro area countries
 
have 
e
xperienced an increase of labour supply
 
since the early 2000s
, largely explained by 
developments in the labour force participation rate
. Moreover, the steepest rise in the 
labour force participation rate was observed for older workers
, following a seminal 
decline before the turn of the century
.
108
 
Th
is raises
 
the question
:
 
what has been driving
 
th
is 
increase in the labour 
force 
participation rate
 
of older workers?
 
Deciding on when to exit the labour market and 
enter retirement is a complex individual choice. Factors that influence this choice 
include: the relevant 
labour market
 
situation;
 
the set
-
up of the national 
social securit
y 
system

and 
personal
 
preferences
.
 
T
he net wealth 
position 
of older workers, 
and in this context 
the increasing role of occupational 
pensions, is 
also 
likely to, at least indirectly,
 
influence
 
the
ir
 
retirement decisions
 

 
not 
least because higher net wealth
 
might help
 
to partly compensate
 
for
 
possibly shrinking
 
pension 
entitlements
.
 
Many of these factors have improved over time. In fact, b
etter 
health conditions, rising life expectancy
,
 
higher educational levels
 

 
mainly
 
among 
women
 

 
and rising net wealth reflect long
-
term trends that had already started well 
before the turn of the twenty
-
first century.
 
As such, those factors, though they have 
likely contributed to the rise in participation, cannot be used to fully expla
in the 
particularly sharp rebound in the participation rate of older workers since 2000. This

sharp rebound may, in fact, have been supported by
 
more recent policy changes, such 
as pension reforms, which incentivised older 
workers
 
to remain in the labour m
arket 
for 
longer
 
by postponing retirement. Against this background, 
the focus of this article 
will mainly be on the role of pension reforms
.
 
Most euro area countries adopted substantial pension reforms in the last two 
decades to reduce risks to long
-
term f
iscal sustainability.
 
Pension reforms are 
essential in view of the challenges that population ageing poses for financial 
sustainability of the public pension systems, which are predominately pay
-
as
-
you
-
go 
schemes
 
in the euro area
. At the same time, pension
 
payments need to ensure that 
pension benefits are socially adequate. 
The
 
adopted
 
pension 
reforms mainly 
sought to 
reduce
 
the generosity of retirement schemes and
 
to
 
limit eligibility criteria, in particular 
for early retirement
; it can be expected that th
is
 
does encourage
 
older workers 
to 
participate in the labour market for a longer period of time. T
hese pension reforms 
were
 
in some cases 
complemented by labour market reforms tailored toward
s
 
older 
worker
s 

 
for example, incentivising job searches or supp
orting the retention of older 
workers
.
 
However, the COVID
-
19 shock 

 
if prolonged 

 
may bring into question whether 
this increase in the labour force participation rate of older workers will 
continue.
 
Experiences drawn from some earlier shocks suggest that
 
older workers 

 
predominantly those with lower education levels 

 
may be particularly exposed to 
prolonged negative macroeconomic shocks.
109
 
When labour demand drops 
significantly and workers are dismissed they may become discouraged from job 
searching and 
withdraw from the labour market. For older people, this withdrawal may 
not be reversed when the economic conditions improve again, thus, their labour force 
participation rate may be permanently affected. In the current macroeconomic shock 
resulting from CO
VID
-
19, some factors may amplify this effect. First, the direct health 
shock related to the rise of fatality rates with age may make older workers less willing 
to prolong their employment. Second, sectors where older people might have longer 
careers 

 
for 
instance, service sectors 

 
are significantly exposed to the shock. 
However, s
hort
-
time work schemes implemented across the euro area are 
contributing to preserve employment relationships and thus are likely to mitigate the 
possible subsequent discourageme
nt effects
.
110
 
Furthermore, the current crisis may 
negatively affect disposable income and 

 
through pension funds and other personal 
investments 

 

working careers. This may counterbala
nce some of the negative impact mentioned 
above.
 
The current shock may be unlike the financial crisis.
 
In fact, after 2008, unlike in 
earlier shocks, the trend increase of the labour force participation rate continued for 
older workers
111
, while today the ol

willingness to work and thus their labour force participation rate might be at greater

risk. This may be due to the specificities of the health shock, the differences in sectoral 
developments, as well as differe

further pension reforms. Given that recently older workers provided the largest 
contribution to the recent labour force participation rate increases, the impact of the 
macroeconomic shock on their labo
ur market situation may have a large impact on the 
overall labour force participation rate.

Changes in labour force participation rates in the euro area
 
Labour force participation rates increased across euro area countries in the 
p
ast two decades.
 
In the euro area, the overall labour force participation rate of the 
working
-
age population (defined as the population aged between 15 and 74 years) 
increased by almost 5
 
percentage points
 
in the last two decades, reaching 64.5
% in 
2019
. T
his follows an earlier period where the labour force participation rate was flat 
overall (see Chart 1).
112
 
Instead, the 
participation
 
rate of older workers
 
is u
-
shaped 
because it declined until 2000 before increasing strongly between 2001 and 2019.

Notes
: Eurostat data for the euro area as a whole are available from the year 2000 onward. The longest time series for euro area 
countries are available for Germany, France and Italy, starting in 1983. 
We have used 
the aggregation of d
ata 
for these three countries 
for the period between 1983 and 1999
. This is indicated by the dashed lines and columns.
 
Since 2000, the labour force participation rate of older workers showed the 
largest increase in the euro
 
area when compared to other age cohorts.
 
The 
participation rate has been increasing for almost all age groups. In contrast, while it 
has been rising only modestly for those below the age of 55, and even slightly 
decreasing for the 15
-
24 age group, the par
ticipation rate has increased since 2000 by 
around 15 percentage points for those 
in the euro area 
aged between 55 and 74. For 
those aged between 55 and 64 years, the rise has been well over 20 percentage 
points. In 2019 most labour market withdrawals happ
ened in the 65
-
69 age group, 
whereas they occurred in the 60
-
64 age group in 2000. Two decades ago 20% of the 
male population withdrew from the labour market when they were between the ages of 
55 and 59, while 38% withdrew when aged between 60 and 64. Thes
e figures are at 
7% and 30% as of 2019, respectively. A similar pattern can be observed in the female 
population. The participation rates of women aged between 55 and 59 years is now as 
high as the participation rate of those aged between 45 and 49 years t
wo decades ago 
(Chart 2). These figures indicate major changes that happened in the older age cohort 
of the working
-
age population.

The population share of the 55

p increased considerably, from 
about 27% in the early 1980s to 32% in 2019 (Chart 1). This increase is mainly the 
consequence of the baby boom generation reaching this age group. Given the 
generally lower participation rate of older workers compared to pri
me
-
age workers 
(Chart 2), this exerts a negative compositional effect on the overall participation rate. 
However, this has been more than compensated by the rise in the participation rate of 
older workers, resulting in a significant net positive overall im
pact. The age group with 
the largest increases in its labour force participation rate, i.e. those aged between 55 
and 64 years, accounts for 3.8 percentage points of the overall 4.7 percentage point 
change observable for the entire working
-
age population (

Notes
: The charts refer to the entire 
working
-
age population. The compositional effect is calculated as the difference between the actual 
labour force participation rate of the 15
-
74 age group in 2019 and the weighted average of the participation rates using the 2000 
population shares as weigh
ts. Data are available for age groups comprising five
-
year age ranges (e.g. 25
-
29, 30
-
34, 35
-
39, etc.). Such 
five
-
year age groups are used here and only the age composition is taken into consideration for the calculations. The compositiona
l 
effects are mor
e negative in countries with more significant increases in the population share of the age groups with low participation 
rates and a larger difference in the labour force participation rate across age groups. Apart from developments in the older 
age groups
, 
the share of the population weight of the youngest working
-
age cohorts also has an impact on this decomposition.
 
This pattern 
of older workers being the main drivers of labour force 
participation rate increases 
is 
evident
 
across 
all
 
euro area countries.
 
The overall 
labour force participation rate has been increasing in all euro area countries in the last 
two decades, although to varying degrees. In most countries, a major part of the 
overall increase can be explained by the 55
-
74 age group
 
remaining acti
ve for longer. 
The contribution of the rest of the working
-
age population remains more diverse 
across the euro area countries. For example, it is strongly negative in Slovakia and 
strongly positive in Malta. The age compositional effect tends to be negativ
e in more 
than half of the euro area countries, mainly reflecting the ageing of the baby boom 
generation (Chart 3).
 
The rise of labour force participation rate of older workers is more pronounced 
for women.
 
In
 
the euro area, the recent increase in the fema
le participation rate in the 
55
-
74 age group (19 percentage points) exceeded that of men (15 percentage points). 
Still, women in this age group continue to participate in the labour market less than 
men (Chart 2)
. 
This is true for all euro area countries. 
Between 2000 and 2019, t
he 
difference 
between
 
the 
increase in the male 
participation rate and
 
the female 
participation rate
 
was particularly pronounced in 
Latvia, Estonia, Ireland, Slovakia, 
Cyprus and Spain.
 
The increase in the participation rate 
is large
ly independent of 
education levels.
 
While participation rates are usually higher for workers with higher education levels 
compared to low
-
skilled workers, the steep increase in the participation rates of older 
workers was observed across all 
education leve
l
s. At the same time, the population 
share of people with low education is declining (in the 55

share analysis suggests that this compositional effect is moderate for 
older workers (explaining about one
-
fifth of the change for the 55
-
64 age group), while 
the major part of the rise in the participat
ion rate seen in the last two decades would 
have happened even with unchanged education levels.
 
The rise of the participation rate of older workers has been a major driver of the 
increasing labour supply.
 
Recent labour supply developments have been 
dominat
ed by older workers: between 2000 and 2019, 98% of the increase in the 
overall labour supply came from those aged between 55 and 74. This mainly reflects 
the increasing participation rate (explaining about two
-
thirds of the rising labour supply 
of older wo
rkers) and, to a smaller degree, the rising population of this age group.
113
 
In the last two decades the rising labour force of older workers combined with a 
strong increase in their employment, while unemployment remained moderate
.
 
The rise of the labour 
force participation rate of older workers transformed almost 
entirely to a higher employment share (increasing by around 15 and 19 percentage 
points
 
for men and women, respectively), while the number of unemployed changed 
only a little. Older workers are g
enerally characterised by a lower unemployment rate 
than the younger cohorts, partly reflecting that often they move to inactivity in case of a 
loss of job.
114
 
However, the moderate change of the unemployment rate of older 
workers following the strong increa
ses in the labour force participation rate is 
remarkable. This, in turn, reflects that the 55
-
74 age group was the main contributor to 
employment growth in the period examined. This
 
does not 
seem to have been 
accompanied by a rise of
 
potentially 
precarious
 
contracts
 
(such as temporary 
contracts, underemployed part
-
time workers, self
-
employed)
 
in this age group. 
Indeed, most of the increase of the employment of 
older workers 
was due to
 
permanent
, full
-
time
 
position
s (Chart 4)
. 
P
art
-
time employment has 
also 
i
ncreased
 
somewhat
, 
mainly for women, mostly 
in line with the preferences of older workers. 
 
                                        
                           
 
113
 
 
The labour force of older workers has also increased in the United States (driven by demographic 
developments) while the participation rate of the older age group has been relatively stable, following a 
rise until 2008. In Japan, the labour force of those 
above the age of 55 has also been increasing. This 
reflects both the rising population of this age group and the rise of the labour force participation rate. In 
2019 the labour force participation rate of the 55
-
64 age group was 65% in the United States an
d 78% in 
Japan, which compares to 63.6% in the euro area. Source: Eurostat, Haver, U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics.
 
114
 
 
Due to this difference, the rising population share of older workers exerted a downward compositional 
impact on the unemployment rate. Wi
thout this negative compositional effect between 2000 and 2019, 
the unemployment rate of the 15
-
74 age group would have been 0.6 percentage points higher in 2019 
(using the composition of the labour force and unemployment rates by five
-
year age group and g
ender). 
This calculation is based on taking the age
-
specific unemployment rates as given. However, due to the 
endogeneity between labour demand and labour supply, the age
-
specific unemployment rates would be 
different at a different labour supply path. Wit
hout the aging of the baby boom generation, labour demand 
would have likely developed differently during this period. For age
-
specific unemployment rates, see

When do older workers retire?
 
When do older workers actually retire in the euro area?
 
The timing of older 
workers exiting the labour market does not necessarily fully align with their 
entry in
to
 
retirement
. While comparable data on the actual avera
ge retirement age is 
not 
publicly 
available for all countries, several indicators could serve as proxy. One of them is 

 
age at which people 
withdraw from the labour market. It is defined by
 
the 
Organisation for Economic 
Co
-
operation and Development (
OECD
)
 

force during a five
-
year period for workers initially ag

.
 
The effective 
retirement age 
may 
well 
differ from the statutory 
retireme
nt
 
age, which 
defines
 
the age 
at which people become eligible for a full pension.
115
 
The effective retirement age 
has 
changed considerably over time and across 
countries
 

 
broadly in line with the dynamics of the participation rate of older 
workers, as shown
 
in Chart 1
.
 
The average effective retirement age within the euro 
area constantly declined towards the end of the last century to a level of as low as 61 
years for men and below 60 years for women (Chart 5). From 2000 onwards, the 
effective retirement age 
started to rise, even though the recovery was briefly 
interrupted during the financial crisis. By 2018, the effective retirement age for men 
stood at more than 64 years and for women at almost 63 years, which corresponds to 
                                        
                           
 
115
 
 
The effective retirement age has some drawbacks as an indicator. It is a lagged indicator, based on a 
five
-
year period. As it is partly driven by cyclical developments, its usefulness is limited for countries 
particularly str
ongly affected by the financial crisis, such as Greece and Spain. Moreover, the indicator 
does not enable differentiating between whether an exit from the labour market is due to entry into 
retirement and other reasons (such as a disability pension or cari
ng for family members). Furthermore it 
does not capture part
-
time working arrangements among older workers.

Analogous 
developments 
were
 
observed for t
he duration of
 
working careers, in 
particular among women.
 
The length of working careers is another indicator 
for
 
the 
actual retirement age. Since 2000, the duration of working life increased for men by 2 
years and for women by almost 6 years, standing at 
almost 39 years and 33 ½ years
 
in 
2019
, respectively (Charts

in the context
 
of rising education 
levels
, particularly for women
. Women work longest in Estonia, Lithuania, the 
Netherlands and Finland, while the most substantial improv
ements since 2000 were 
achieved in Spain, Luxembourg and Malta.
 
Overall, the rising duration of working 
careers seem to
 
broadly coincide with the sharp rise of the participation rate of older 
workers.

Why do older workers remain in the labour market for a 
longer period of time?
 
From a conceptual point of view, there are many possible reasons for older 
workers 
to 
postpon
e
 
retirement
 
and 
remain in the labour market
 
for a longer 
period of time
.
 
Entering retirement is a complex individual decision, influenced by 
many factors including the attributes of relevant 
labour markets, 
the set
-
up of national 
social security systems

 
and
 
their
 
individual 
preferences.
 
While most of these factors have changed considerably in the past two 
decades, the extent to which they serve to explain the steep increase in the labour 
force participation rate of older workers can be expected to differ.
 
Healthy ageing is likely to enco
urage longer working lives.
 
Healthy ageing not 
only implies an increase in life expectancy, but also better health conditions of older 
cohorts, both reflecting long
-
term trends. Since 2000, life expectancy at age 65 in the 
euro area increased on average by
 
2 ½ years, reaching almost 21 years in 2018, with

110
 
a stronger improvement for men compared to women.
117
 
The number of healthy years 
expected at older ages has also improved in many countries. Several factors might 
have positively affected the health of indiv

prerequisite for older workers to stay longer in the labour force. Healthy ageing might 
be positively influenced by higher educational levels, as life expectancy is found to be 
higher for people with higher edu
cation.
118
 
Structural changes of labour markets, labour market policies and cyclical 
l
abour demand
 
have supported the improvement of the labour market situation 
for older workers
.
 
While labour demand has likely contributed to the improvement 
seen before the 
financial crisis and during the euro area recovery (between early 2013 
and end
-
2019), the increase in the participation rate of older workers does not seem to 
have been strongly distorted by cyclical developments. At the same time, structural 
changes in th
e labour markets 

 
for example a rising share of jobs in the service sector 

 
has likely supported longer working careers due to higher overall labour demand and 
by offering physically less demanding working conditions than manufacturing and 
construction. 
In addition, several labour market reforms have influenced the labour 
market for older workers 

 
these are summarised in
 
Box 1.

Labour market reforms and their impact on older workers
 
Prepared by Katalin Bodn
á
r
 
Apart from pension reforms, labour market reforms can influence the labour market 
for
 
older workers. 
Some of these reforms are specifically tailored towards older workers. Others 
affect
 
all workers but 
may have a higher impact on those that are less strong
ly attached to the labour market in terms of 
their labour force participation rate, including older workers. This box gives an overview of labour 
market reforms that have likely 
affected
 
the labour market 
for
 
older workers in the
 
euro area
 
during 
the last 
two decades
.
 
The 
position 
of older workers 
in the labour market 
is characterised by an important duality. On the one 
hand, 
the
 
share of 
older workers who hold 
permanent positions
 
is higher than that of 
younger 
workers
, thus 
older workers are
 
more protected
 
once in employment. On the other hand, 
older 
workers
 
may be in less favourable positions than younger workers 
when searching for a job
, due to, 
among other
 
things
, age discrimination. The latter feature may also reflect 
a 
lower educational level 
on averag
e for older workers 
compared to younger workers.
119
 
With this in mind
, ensuring the 
employability of older workers is an important labour market policy objective.

The data are based on Eurostat statistics and calculated as a weighted average of the euro area 
countries, using total population as weights.

Reforms affecting alternative pathways to retirement
 
Conditions of alternative pathways to early retirement, 
such as
 
unemployment or disability benefits, 
are likely to 
affect
 
the labour supply of older people. Several European countries introduced specific 
conditions for unemployment benefits 
for
 
older worke
rs in the 1980s, for example by providing a 
longer duration of unemployment benefits or by removing the requirement 
that recipients look
 
for a 
job while receiving 
unemployment benefits
. These 
changes 
contributed to the rise of long
-
term 
unemployment 
f
or ol
der workers (or
, in cases where those out of work were not searching for a job, a 

 
the
 

 
labour market statistics). 
120
 
In 
the late 1990s 
until
 
the 
early 2000s, these schemes were tightened 
in several countries.
121
 
In terms of 
reducing long
-
term unemployment among older people, Germany stands out: the long
-
term 
unemployment rate of the 55
-
64 age group declined from almost 9% in 2006 to 1% in 2019. This 
decline followed the 
Hartz reforms, which 
included a large set of reform measures, including 
tightening unemployment benefits for older workers, but also other reforms supporting retention and 
job search
es
. Finland also seems to have been successful in decreasing the long
-
term 
unemployment rate of
 
older workers, following the tightening of the unemployment benefit criteria for 
older workers in 1997.
122
 
Social safety nets provide insurance against the risk of becoming disabled and support those people 
whose working capacity becomes limited. 
However, t
hese schemes
 
may
 
serve as 
alternative 
path
ways to retirement, even for those whose working capacity is not entirely damaged. 
In the euro 
area, 
disability pension schemes were tightened between 2000 and 2018 in about half of the euro 
area 
countries (Chart A
)
.
123
 
Th
is
 
was
 
implemented either by 
tightening
 
the eligibility criteria for 
obtaining a disability pension or by decreasing the generosity of their disability pension system. The 
number of disability pensioners (of all ages) declined in the countries that t
ightened their disability 
schemes, as can be seen 
in
 
Chart 
A, panel c
. However, in the 55
-
74 age group, the population share 
of those who are inactive due to their own sickness or disability has not declined
 
(see Chart A, panel 
b)
, suggesting that the tigh
tening of disability schemes could have affected other generations than 
thos
e in the above 55 year age bracket.

ersons in unemployment are 
defined as all those of working age who were not in employment, carried out activ
ities to seek 
employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a 
job opportunity

.
 
People who do not carry out activities to seek employment are considered as inactive 
even when they receive unemployment 
benefits.

Notes:
 
When grouping the countries, the change in disability pension as a percentage of GDP between 2000 and 2016 was taken into acc
ount. If, instead, 
averages from
 
2012
-
2016 and 2000
-
2004 are used for the calculation of the change, the classification remains unchanged. Tightening countries are: Germany, 
Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Finland.
 
Policies directly supporting 
the employment of older workers
 
M
easures that 
affect
 
retention on the one hand and promote the employability and productivity of 
older workers on the other hand are also important in boosting the participation rate. Such reforms 
may 
include wage subsidies 
for older workers, stronger job protection and more flexible working 
times, which are complemented by 
information 
measures 
targeted at employers
 
(
such as
 
campaigns 
to increase awareness about the benefits of age diversification and 
campaigns 
against the 
di
scrimination 
towards
 
older workers).
124
 
For example, in Germany, wage subsidies in the form of 
in
-
work benefits and temporary wage subsidies 
have been 
paid 
since 
2003
 
for older workers. In 
Luxembourg, a 2014 reform made it possible for workers over 
the age o
f 
50 to go part
-
time and for the 
employers to ask for subsidies in case another worker is hired to make up for the missing hours.
 
Impact of general labour market reforms on older workers
 
Recent reforms in euro area countries point to somewhat less
 
stringen
t
 
employment protection 
legislation (EPL) and more wage flexibility
 
for the labour markets as a whole
. Higher EPL tends to 
support the employment ratio of older workers
.
125
 
While 
overall decreasing employment protection 
may have been unfavourable for older w
orkers
, 
data from the 
Labour Market Reform (
LABREF
)
 
database suggests that 
the overall change of EPL may have been less tilted to flexibility for older 
workers than for others 
(
see 
Chart B
, left panel
). 
The role of wage flexibility may be less clear
-
cut. 
W
age rigidity influences the degree to which employment reacts to macroeconomic shocks. 
Most of 
the 
recent labour market reforms aimed at increasing 
overall 
wage flexibility in euro area countries
 
have primarily affected incumbents, thus implicitly having a
 
potentially larger impact on older workers 
than younger ones 
(
see 
Chart B
, right panel
). 
This 
may have contributed to 
increased
 
hiring of older

people
 
(for example in Italy)
 
may 
affect 
older people 
to a larger extent than younger people because the share of self

ent increases 
with age.
 
Overall, several labour market reforms, both those tailored towards older people and more general 
one
s
, affected the labour market 
for
 
older workers in the euro area. With the ageing of the 
working
-
age population, reforms that suppo
rt the labour supply, labour demand, employability and 
productivity of older workers will remain important on the reform agenda of eu
ro area countries.
 
 
The characteristics of pension 
schemes
 
are important determinants of
 
the 
retirement behaviour of older 
workers.
 
Pension schemes provide for a range of 
circumstances, from old
-
age pensions to disability pensions, and can be designed in 
different ways, from public pensions to occupational pensions, and from 
pay
-
as

s. With respect to old

age 
pensions, including early retirement schemes, age eligibility parameters for pensions 
are a decisive factor in determining the participation rate of older workers. Statutory 
and early pension ages may serve either as constraints,
 
after which working is not

or at least as an indicator of when to retire. Moreover, incentives to stay in 
the labour market for a longer period are seen to be negatively correlated with the 
generosity of pension payments. In case pension entitl
ements are cut, for example by 
raising the malus applied in case of early retirement, this is likely to encourage 
prolonged working lives. This also has to be seen against comfortable net wealth 
positions of households in retirement on average (see Box 2).
 
In addition, moving to 
actuarial
ly
 
fairer 
adjustments for delayed 
retirement, for example in the form of a 
bonus, can be expected to have a positive impact on the duration of working lives. 
Furthermore, more flexible pension arrangements which allow combi
ning work and 
retirement are expected to positively affect the decision to postpone retirement. In 
case of more restricted access to programmes that offer alternative pathways out of 
the labour market, such as disability pensions (see Box 1), this might al
so encourage 
old
-

Net wealth of households in retirement in the euro area

This box reviews the concept of net wealth of households in the euro area, with a focus on 
pension
-
related wealth 
at 
retirement age. Individual retirement decisions are 
partly 
based on 
expectations of welfare level
s
 
in retirement. Wealth accumulation
128
 
is a
n important factor for 
mitigating any potential decrease in labour and pension income at a later stage in life (
e.g.
 
as a 
conseque
nce of future pension reforms).
 
Household 

net

 
wealth is the value of
 
wealth 
(
total assets broken down by 
financial and 
non
-
financial) held by households netted out by 
the value of outstanding debt liabilities. 
Overall, the 
average 
stock of household net wealth increased notably at the euro area 
level 
from around 550% of 
annual household gross disposable income (GDI) in 2002 t
o around 710% in 2019.
129
 
The net wealth 
trajectories are heterogeneous across countries reflecting different starting positions, societal 
preferences, and tax and savings policies.
130
 
Based on sectoral accounts, household wealth by 
end
-
2019 was broadly compos
ed 
of
 
housing wealth (around 460% of GDI), financial wealth (350%) 
and
, with opposite sign,
 
debt liabilities (100%). The main financial assets held by households are 
liquid assets (currency and deposits) and 
voluntary pension and life insurance
, followed
 
b
y debt 
securities and equity.
 
Pension entitlements add to financial wealth but the way they are recorded deserves particular 
attention because future pension entitlements are difficult to capture statistically yet they represent a 
major source of financial
 
wealth.

pension wealth

This 
augmented concept of household pension wealth
 
leads to larger estimates of 
pension wealth
, at approximately three to six times 
of 
annual household GDI for most euro area 
countries. This
 
augmented
 
concept captures the 
substantia
l 
additional pension wealth 
in the 
countries 
where
 
pension schemes are predominantly organised as social security pensions, such as 
in Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy or Finland. It is also particularly relevant in countries with 
a 
predominance 
of u
nfunded (defined benefit) schemes, such as in Portugal
,
 
or Malta
, which are 
managed by the Government but recorded outside the core government sector accounts
. 
By 
contrast, f
unded employment

related pension schemes (whether
 
managed privately or by the
 
Gove

)
, which
 
are very important
, e.g.
 
in the Netherlands, 
they are 
already reflected in the core 
accounts. Voluntary pension assets tend to be 
important
 
in countries where the 
G
overnment 
encourages such saving schemes, such as in France, Malta, Italy, Ir
eland, Germany or Belgium.

the role of pension reforms
 
 
117
 
Against this background, pension reforms can be expected to play a key role 
in
 
the changes in the 
participation rate of older workers.
 
While 
better health
 
conditions
, 
rising
 
education, and 
more favourable labour market conditions are 
expected to support a 
higher labour participation rate of older workers, 
these
 
common
 
long
-
term trend 
factors alone are 
not able
 
to explain the 
recent increase in the 
participation rate
 
and its large variation across countries
. This shifts the focus on to 
how pension reforms mi
ght have affected the old
-
age participation rate.

Recent pension reforms across euro area countries and their 
labour market impact
 
While all euro area countries adopted pension reform measures during the past 
two decades, they varied across countries in 
terms of intensity and frequency.
 
The pension reforms comprised 
in particular 
increases in the statutory retirement age, 
more flexible retirement arrangements
 
to combine work and retirement
, financial 
incentives for prolonging working lives beyond the stat
utory retirement age, less 
generous (early) retirement schemes and stricter eligibility 
criteria 
for earl
y retirement 
for instance due to 
more required contributory
 
years
.
133
 
The pension reforms 
implemented in the last decade were particularly substantial in
 
countries subject to 
adjustment programmes, such as Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal.
 
Pension reforms are important not only for fiscal sustainability but also for 
labour supply.
 
P
opulation ageing 
is 
plac
ing
 
upward pressure on 
mostly 
already 
elevated le
vels of age
-
related public spending
, including old
-
age pension 
expenditures
.
134
 
The recently adopted pension reforms have helped to 
strengthen 
the 

pension systems
 
in view of population ageing and 
to contain long
-
term fisca
l sustainability risks.
135
 
Moreover, pension reforms are seen 
as an 
important factor 
of
 
prolonged working lives
.
 
Statutory retirement ages have been 
raised
 
in almost all euro area countries.
 
Since 2000, the age limits for receiving a full pension increased by on average more 
than two years for men and almost four years for women in the euro area countries 
(Chart
 
8
). Increases of 5 years or more were implemented in two countries, France 
and Sl
ovenia, 
both 
for men and women, and in six countries, namely Germany, 
Estonia, Italy, Greece, Latvia and Lithuania, only for women. The generally more 
pronounced increase of eligibility ages for women 
reflects
 
a common trend in Europe 
to
wards
 
equalis
ing
 
th
e retirement ages of men and women. Only a few countries, 
namely Belgium (only men), Luxembourg and Austria, left the eligibility age 
unchanged during the past two decades. 
Most
 
countries have also restricted access to 
old
-
age pension payments by making th
em contingent on a higher number of

Successive vintages of the 

Ageing Report project a decline in the 
level of public 
pension expenditure in 2050 
from 13.3% of GDP in the 2001 report to 11.7% of GDP in the 2018 report. 
However, these figures need to be interpreted with care, as neither the forecasting horizon nor the 
country composition are fully comparabl
e across vintages and the starting level has also changed over 
time

contribution years, which is particularly relevant for the sustainability of 
predominately 
defined benefit schemes. The trend of rising statutory retirement ages is expected to 
continue, as several countries 
decided to 
a
utomatically link the retirement age
 
to 
changes in life expectancy.
 
Chart

Statutory retirement age
 
(age year)
 
 
Source: National sources and own calculations.
 
Stricter eligibility criteria for statutory pensions were often complemented by 
restrictions
 
on
 
early retirement.
 
All euro area countries, except Ireland and the 
Netherlands, have early retirement schemes in place.
136
 
Some 
countries
 
even 
operate several early retirement schemes 
in parallel 
which target specific groups of 
workers. Most early retirement
 
schemes entail deductions to allow for 
more 
actuarial 
fairness. Since 2000, the early retirement age limit was raised on average by 3
 
½ 
 
years for men and 
by 
more than 4 years for wom
e
n, reaching around 61 years for both 
men and women in 2019
 
(Chart 9)
. S
ome countries, mainly those that 
implemented an 
automatic 
link
 
between
 
re
tirement age and changes in life e
xpectancy
,
 
also broadened 
this 
instrument 
to their early retirement schemes. In addition, six euro area countries 
(Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, F
rance and Austria) allow 
receipt of
 
full pension 
without 
any 
deductions before reaching the statutory retirement age. 
However, 
entitlements are usually
 
made 
conditional on specific criteria, such as long working 
careers
. Since 2000, these requirements were
 
significantly increased to currently 
around 40 contributory years or more
.
 
By requiring very long working careers, such 
early retirement schemes have implicitly become predominantly tailored towards 
workers with earlier career starts and lower educational
 
levels.
 
                                        
                           
 
136
 
 
Early retirement schemes are specific schemes that allow people to enter retirement before reaching the 
statutory retirement age, mostly contingent on long working careers and implying
 
an adjustment of 
pension entitlements. Besides specific early retirement schemes, an early exit from the labour market 
was also encouraged through the use of unemployment, sickness or disability insurance schemes for 
older workers. Most of these schemes w
ere introduced in the 1970s in response to rising unemployment

: 
Ireland and the Netherlands do not have an early retirement scheme. 
No data available for Malta. 
While some countries have

Most countries have embedded in their pension schemes some (financial) 
incentives for older workers to prolong their working careers.
 
To incentivise older 
workers to stay in the labour market
 
for a longer pe
riod
, sometimes even beyond the 
statutory retirement age
, several
 
countries tuned their pension systems in the past two 
decades by 
more strongly rewarding
 
delayed retirement or by 
allowing retirees to 
continue working (Chart 10)
. 
However, t
he concrete set
-
up of these measures
 
is very 
country
-
specific. Financial incentives are mostly provided in
 
the
 
form of a pension 
bonus for delayed retirement and through age
-
dependent tax credits for older workers. 
Some countries allow older workers to claim pension payme
nts while working up to a 
certain age limit, while others do not set any upper boundary. Against the background 
of generally rising statutory retirement ages, these measures
 
have also been
 
increasingly affecting 
the participation rate of 
age cohort
s beyond
 
65 years.

Reducing the gene
rosity of pension benefits can be expected to encourage 
older workers to retire later.
 
Many e
uro area countries reduced the generosity of 
their public pension systems mainly with the aim 
of
 
improv
ing
 
the financial 
sustainability of their pension schemes. 
O
lder workers might postpone their retirement 
date to compensate
 
for
 
the pension shortfall
, which 
might have a positive side effect 
on the participation rate. In the euro area
,
 
pension entitlements were cut through 
various means, such as by lowering the acc
rual rate by which pensionable earnings 
are transferred into pension entitlements
;
 
by calculating the reference wage for 
pension payment
s
 
on the basis of a full career rather than a subset of best years which 
usually
 
imply higher salaries
;
 
and by strengthe
ning the indexation of pensions to 
inflation developments rather than wage developments.
137
 
Moreover, several 
countries 
raised the pension tax rates and 
made early retirement financially less 
attractive by increasing 
penalties for early retirement.
 
All these
 
pension reforms 
can be
 
expected to 
incentivise older workers to delay
 
their 
retirement decision.
 
Th
e reform impact can be captured by the 
implicit tax rate 
of 
working one year longer
, which reflects the changes in the 
present value of the 
future stream of
 
pension benefits 
of a standardised worker in comparison to the 
additional earnings gained by working one year longer
.
138
 
A 
high 
positive value of the 
implicit tax rate for working longer reveals incentives for retiring earlier, while a 
negative value can be
 
considered 
to be
 
a kind of 
subsidy for working longer
 

 
this is 
because the additional earnings from working one year longer exceed the shortfall in

The calculation of the implicit tax rate of working longer requires detailed, country

fic information. 
This explains why only very few cross

the present value of pension benefits
. The value of the implicit tax rate depends on the 
underlying parame
ters of the respective pension scheme and therefore varies across 
country, age cohort and time. For example, in 
the 
case of an early retirement scheme
,
 
the implicit tax rate tends to increase 
in the year
 
before reaching the 
earliest
 
age 
at 
which one is eli
gible for 
early retirement, while flattening somewhat thereafter.
 
Pension reforms that affect the generosity of the pension system and postpone the 
retirement age are expected to result in a lower implicit tax rate. The few available 
studies on euro area c
ountries suggest an overall decline of the implicit tax rate for 
both men and women. In fact, a recent study shows that t
he implicit tax rate 
for 
workers at age 62 
more than halved
 
for a group of euro area countries
, from above 
45% on average in 2000 to ar
ound 20% in 2015, notwithstanding large cross
-
country 
differences.

The implicit tax rate for working longer seems to be negatively correlated with 
the participation rate of older workers, as also confirmed in the literature.
 
A 
declin
e in the
 
implici
t tax rate 
as a result of pension reforms can be seen as an 
indication that
 
older workers postpon
e
 
their 
entry in
to
 
retirement. The positive effect of 
pension 
reforms on incentives to participate in the labour market
 
for longer
 
has been 
broadly confirmed i
n 
several studies. They 
find evidence that people react to changes 
in financial incentives (
such as 
early retirement deductions, but also lifetime income 
and wealth effects) as well as to changes in the statutory pension age.

Pension reforms, in particular those restricting access to 
early retirement
 
schemes, 
are found 
to have played a major role in driving up the 
employment rate of older people. In fact, based on pooled panel regressions
,
 
the
 
results suggest an 
increase 
in 
the employment 
rate 
of older workers (at 
an average 
early retirement age
 
of 62
 
years
) by 6.7 percentage points for men and 4.6 percentage 
points for women
 
in the case of a decline in the implicit tax rate (from 100% to zero)
. At 
the statutory retirement age, the positive impact on 
the 
employment 
rate 
is estimated 
to stand at 1.8 per
centage points. 
These findings are broadly in line with other 
studies.
142
 
At the same time, disentangling the impact of pension reforms on the labour 
force participation rate across countries is far from trivial.
 
First, pension schemes 
and the amount and 
sco
pe
 
of pension reforms differ considerably across countries, 
while the 
specific 
features of reforms are important with respect to their concrete 
impact on labour supply. Second, considerable variation exists with respect to the date 
pension reforms were ado
pted and 
the time period between announcement and 
implement
ation of reforms
. In particular, long implementation delays 
have been found 
to 
have macroeconomic effects, not at least as people try to advance retirement to still 
benefit 
from
 
the old regime.
143
 
Third, the pace of reform implementation varied across 
countries. In some countries, such as Germany, certain pension reform elements were 
implemented very gradually, while in others, such as Italy
,
 
the increase in the statutory 
retirement age was impleme
nted 
rather 
abruptly. 
This has implications for when the 
participation rate of older workers will be affected.
 
Furthermore, pension reform reversals may have adverse implications for 
labour supply.
 
M
ore recently, several countries are contemplating whether
 
to revers
e
 
previously adopted 
pension 
reforms, in view of rising political pressure. 
In a few 
countries, such steps have indeed already been decided. However, as recent 
research has shown, 
undoing past pension reforms would 
not only pose challenges 
for fi
scal sustainability, but would also 
generate
 
substantial adverse 
macro
economic 
costs
, including for the labour supply.
144
 
Thus, if this trend of reform reversals 
continues, it
 
is likely to 
result in a declining participation rate
 
of older workers.

Conclusi
ons
 
This article argues
 
that several factors played a role 
in
 
the considerable 
increase in the labour force participation rate of older workers during the past 
two decades.
 
The participation rate of older workers increased particularly strongly 
among women
, 
although they were 
starting from a lower level
 
than men. 
Various 
factors can determine the participation rate of older workers.
 
Deciding on when to 
enter retirement is a complex choice, influenced by many factors, including: the 
labour 
market
 
situation;
 
the set
-
up of the 
social security systems

their 
net wealth
 
and its expected evolution;
 
and 
their 
individual preferences
.
 
While 
many of these factors have changed considerably over time, most of them are 
long
-
term trends, such as 
b
etter health conditions, rising life expectancy and higher 
educational levels
, and therefore cannot explain the steep increase in the participation 
rate since 2000. In turn, pension reforms seem to have played a decisive role in driving 
the participation 
rate up. They comprise 
increases in the statutory retirement age, 
more flexible retirement arrangements
 
to combine work and retirement
, financial 
incentives for prolonging working lives beyond the statutory retirement age, less 
generous (early) retirement 
schemes and stricter eligibility 
criteria 
for retiring earlier
,
 
for instance due to an increase in
 
the
 
contributory
 
years required.
 
Looking 
ahead, various factors will play a role in driving the labour force 
participation rate of older workers in future 
years, with the overall impact being 
unclear.
 
First, the latest population projections suggest that the relative share of the 
cohort of older workers will shrink somewhat, once the baby boom generation has 
entered retirement. This would drive the overall p
articipation rate up by itself, all other 
things being equal. Moreover, to further contain fiscal sustainability risks related to 
population ageing, governments would need to pursue further pension reforms with a 
potentially positive impact on the labour f
orce participation rate of older workers. 
However, if the recent trend of pension reform reversals were to continue, this is likely 
to have an adverse impact on the labour force participation rate of older workers. 
Finally, in the shorter term all these ef
fects are likely to be dominated by the impact of 
the COVID
-
19 pandemic and the severe macroeconomic implications, including on 
the labour market. The experience from past severe macroeconomic shocks suggests 
that the labour force participation rate of old
er workers is likely to be negatively 
affected
, unless mitigated by 
policy intervention.

Introduction
 
TARGET2
, the payment system owned and operated by the Eurosystem,
 
plays a 
vital role in the euro area
,
 
support
ing
 
the implementation of 
monetary policy 
as 
well as 
the functioning of financial markets and economic activity.
 
Central banks 
and commercial banks use T
ARGET2 for monetary policy operations, interbank 
payments and customer payments.
146
 
The system
 
processes 
euro
-
denominated 
payments in 
central bank money
, on a gross basis
, in real time and with immediate 
finality
. 
It
 
ensures the free flow of central bank mon
ey across the euro area, supporting 
economic activity, financial stability and promoting financial integration in the EU.
147
 
Moreover, TARGET2 has a global reach through correspondent banking,
148
 
which 
further 
supports the operations
 
of 
EU 
banks and firms.
 
Cen
tral bank liquidity
 

 
funds 
held by banks at the central bank,
 
including 
the 
minimum reserves
 
they must hold 

 
is 
held on TARGET2 accounts and can be used to mak
e payments throughout the day.
 
Liquidity plays a central role in 
r
eal
-
t
ime 
g
ross 
s
ettlement 
(RTGS) system
s
, as 
without it no payment can be settled.
149
 
RTGS systems 
require considerable
 
liquidity, as payments are settled one by one. 
They thus typically have
 
features that 
enable
 
participants to save
 
liquidity. TARGET2 offers a number of such feature
s to 
support participants in their intraday liquidity management.
150
 
In addition,
 
participants 
can use the
 
intraday credit line (ICL) facility 
offered by 
the Eurosystem when 
the 
liquidity on their accounts 
is not sufficient 
to settle payments.
151
 
They
 
can 
also
 
actively 
manage their payment flows, for example by 
synchronis
ing
 
their outgoing 
and 
incoming payments, 
thus 
making more efficient use of the liquidity available in the 
system.
 
During periods of 
generally 
higher levels of liquidity, less effort is needed 
on

how 
liquidity distribution 
across countries 
affects 
the 
reliance on intraday credit

the
 
time of payment

These aspects
 
are 
important
 
for the payment system operator
:
153
 
a 
large 
intraday credit line increases the payment capacity
154
 
of 
the respective 
participant, 
making payment settlement smoother. 
Nevertheless, if a participant
 
cannot
 
repay
 
its 
credit
 
at the end of day, 
the l
atter 
is automatically transformed into
 
overnight credit at 

marginal lending
 
rate
.
 
The
 
earlier 
payments are

d, the lower the
 
operational risk.
155
 
Should 
an 
operational disruption 
occur during 
the day, 
the 
more 
payments 
have been 
settled 
up to
 
that point, 
the lower the pressure on
 
the system 
once 
it resumes settlement activity.
 
The remainder of the article is structured as follows
. Section 2 provides an overview of 
liquidity distribution in TARGET2. Section 3 describes the implications of liquidity 
distribution 
for
 
payment settlement in TARGET2. Section 4 concludes and discusses 
the relevance of 
the
 
findings.

used in TARGET2 stood at 5.0, while
 
in 
mid

it
 
stood at 3.3
. The efficiency of the liquidity 
used is computed as the ratio of total payments set

Payment systems ma
y be owned and operated by a central bank or by the private sector. 
In its role as 
owner and operator of TARGET2, the Eurosystem offers settlement in central bank money by allowing 
financial institutions to transfer funds held in accounts with their centra
l bank to each other. Acting in an 
operational capacity is one way for a central bank to ensure that the system meets the safety and 
efficiency standards it has set.
 
154
 
 
The payment capacity of a TARGET2 participant at the start of the business day is defin
ed as the sum of 
the opening balance on its account and the amount of the ICL set.

With

Note: The data points represent monthly averages of daily data. Data cover the period from June 2008 to December 2019.
 
Most of the liquidity in TARGET2 is held by eight jurisdictions.
 
Germany, France, 
the Netherlands, Ital
y, Spain, Finland, Belgium and Luxembourg account on average for 
92.5% of the total liquidity held in TARGET2 (see Chart 1), broadly in line with the 
distribution of excess liquidity. Between June 2008 and December 2019 the share of 
liquidity held by Germa
ny stood at an average of 28.2%, compared with 21.9% for 
France and 16.3% for the Netherlands.

the largest contributors to the T

accounting for around 68.0% of the value settled.
159
 
Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain and 
Italy followed, with shares ranging between 4.0% and 9.0%. The concentration of 
payment activity in a few countrie
s is the consequence of a number of factors, including 
the size of the national banking system, the presence of financial market infrastructures, 

country in providing ac
cess to TARGET2 to non
-
euro area banks.
 
Liquidity in TARGET2 is concentrated 
among
 
a subset of institutions.
 
L
iquidity 
concentration 
is measured using
 
the Gini coefficient
,
160
 
which lies
 
between zero 
(perfect equality) 
and one
 
(
maximum inequality
)
. 
T
he Gini 
coefficient has ranged 
between 0.86 and 0.92 over time
 
(see Table 1)
, indicating that 
most
 
liquidity in 
TARGET2 is held by 
a 
few participants.
 
This is broadly in line with the Gini coefficient 
calculated for minimum reserve requirements, which averaged 0.87 between the 
seventh reserve maintenance period in 2012 and the eighth maintenance period in 
2019.
161
 
Thus the concentration of liquidity in TA
RGET2 largely reflects the 


composition.
 
The 
Gini coefficient
 
for liquidity concentration 
increased fir
st during the 
sovereign debt crisis in 2011
-
12, in line with the 
market 
fragmentation phenomenon 
observed 
at the time.
162
 
It also increased following
 
the start of the PSPP
. This
 
suggests that the additional liquidity injected in
to
 
the system ended up with 
pa
rticipants that already had more liquidity on their accounts than others. On the other 
hand, the introduction of the two
-
tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves 
on 30 October 2019 led to a decrease in the concentration of liquidity holdings. Bo
x 1 
below discusses the impact of the introduction of the two
-
tier system on liquidity 
distribution in TARGET2 in 
greater detail.
 
The 
concentration
 
of liquidity within euro area countries varies
.
 
A
verage
 
figures 
for four periods between June 2008 and Decem
ber 2019 show that
 
concentration has 
ranged from 0.47 to 0.9
3
 
across all jurisdictions
 
(see Table 1)
. The lowest 
concentration levels were recorded before the sovereign debt crisis, whereas the 
highest
 
have been observed most recently
. This is valid across
 
jurisdictions, with very 
few exceptions. 
Since the start of the PSPP
, Germany, Spain
, France
 
and the 
Netherlands 
have 
displayed the highest 
average 
concentration values, whereas 
Slovenia, Ireland and Malta 
have recorded 
the lowest. There 
i
s no clear impac
t of the 
PSPP on the concentration
 
of liquidity at country level.

The impact of the two
-
tier system 
for remunerating excess liquidity 
on the distribution of 
liquidity in TARGET2
 
On 30 October 2019 
the ECB 
introduced a
 
two
-
tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings, 
which coincided with a redistribution of liquidity among the country components in TARGET2. Under
 
the two
-

 
are
 
remunerated at 0% 
up to 
a l
imit of currently 
six times their minimum reserve requirements, creating an incentive for 
them
 
to exploit 
any
 
unused 
exemption allowances
; excess liquidity above this level is subject to the rate on the deposit facility 
(currently 
-
0.50%)
. Banks with exces
s liquidity holdings above the exempt
ion
 
allowances have an 
incentive to lend at negative rates 
more favourable to them 
than the deposit facility rate
, while
 
b
anks 
with unused exemption allowances 
can
 
borrow 
funds at
 
a negative rate 
and deposit them at 0% 
as 
part of
 
the exempted tier. The exempt
ion
 
allowances can be filled on a domestic or cross
-
border 
basis. 
If
 
the allowances are filled 
on a 
cross
-
border
 
basis
, liquidity 
is redistributed 
among the country 
components in TARGET2. In fact, according to ECB st
aff estimations
 
based on excess liquidity data

reduced their unused exemption allowances to 5%, from 28% on 30

The impact of liquidity distribution on payment settlement in 
TARGET2
 
This section explores the link between liquidity distribution in TARGET2 and both the 
usage of credit lines and the time of 
payment settlement
. Credit line usage and the 
time of payment settlement are both important factors in a smooth settlement process.
 
3.1
 
Usage of the intraday credit line
 
The ICL is a facility provided to TARGET2 participants
 
by the Eurosystem, 
against eligible collateral.
166
 
The size of the credit line, which is interest
-
free, 
depends on the amount of collateral posted, which p
articipant
s have the option to 
modify throughout the day. The ICL is automatically used by the system for payment 
settlement when liquidity on 
a
 

TARGET2 account is insufficient. To 
ensure a smooth and timely settlement of payments, it is important 
for 
a participant 
to 
have a sizeable credit line. 
Nevertheless, i
f 
the
 
credit
 
is not repaid 
at the end of day, 
this amount automatically 
becomes subject to interest at the rate on the marginal 
lending facility
. 
Thus
 
an excessive reliance on intraday credit 
could 
expose 
participants to
 
the risk of additional costs if they cannot repay the credit by the end of 
the day.
 
The 
total 
ICL
 
has
 
decreased in the context of 
the 
abundant levels of liquidity 
observed since March 2015.
 
A
fter the launch of the PSPP, the ove
rall 
ICL 
decreased 

on average in
 

in
 
December 2019. 
In the context of the PSPP and the 
asset purchase programme (
APP
) in general
, the 
opportunity cost of holding collateral blocked for the ICL is higher 
than otherwise. This 
can at least partially explain the decline in the ICL. 
P
rior to March 2015 the ICL 
constituted between 78.2% and 95.4% of 

 
overall payment capacity. With 
the
 
recent abundant levels of liquidity, the payment capacity 
has
 
be
en split 
almost 
evenly between the two sources. 
In
 
December 2019, the ICL accounted for 49.4% of 
the payment capacity.

In jurisdictions which are large financial centres, t
he 
ICL makes up a large 
proportion of
 
the payment capacity.
 
Germany and France are t
he locations of large 
custodian banks, while Germany and the Netherlands have historically been used by 
non
-
euro area banks to access TARGET2. 
The ICL accounts for a
bove 75% of the 
payment capacity in these jurisdictions (see Chart 2). These are also the j
urisdictions 
that hold the largest ICLs in 
absolute 
value
 
and the largest holders of liquidity in 
TARGET2
. 
I
n terms of ICL usage
, i.e. the share of the ICL that is actually used to make 
payments
,
167
 
however
, they stand in the middle range, with values betwee
n 20.0% 
and 34.0% (see Chart 3). 
Overall
, these figures suggest that the large ICL values are a 
consequence of the role that these jurisdictions play as financial centres, which results 
in large holdings of collateral
. Assuming that
 
any collateral that is 
not used otherwise
 
(e.g. for open market operations) 
is allocated to ICL
s, ICLs will be large
. 
L
arge ICLs 
cannot 
therefore 
be interpreted as demand
-
driven. 
Other jurisdictions, such as 
Belgium, Greece, Spain, Italy or Luxembourg, also have payment capacity
 
composed 
mainly of ICLs, but with ICLs in absolute terms much lower than in Germany, France or 
the Netherlands.

Given 
relatively
 
limited ICL usage, a 
large
 
component of the ICL seems to be 
supply
-

ICL usage stands at a
round 31.4% on average across jurisdictions 
and different time periods, fluctuating between 11.5% and 50.0% (see Chart 3).

ar
e

The variation in ICL usage may depend on whether the ICL is more supply or

driven, as well as on how well banks manage their liquidity on an intraday 
basis. 
The number of participants that actually use the ICL is als
o limited. 
I
n the 
context of abundant levels of liquidity, only approximately 10.4% of the participants in

The ICL usage is calculated as the ratio of the 
maximum credit used from the intraday credit line 
throughout the day relative to the credit line set.

TARGET2 use the ICL, 
down
 
from 31.9% 
in
 
March 2015. This generally holds true 
across jurisdictions, which constitutes an additional indication that a
 
large component 
of the ICL is actually supply
-
driven. Moreover, the collateral posted f
or
 
the ICL 
can do 

count as collateral that banks have to hold for 
prudential
 
purposes
 
(e.g. liquidity buffers and high
-
quality liquid assets 
to be maintained under 
the liquidity coverage ratio rules)
. When the size of the ICL coincides with the collateral 
that banks have to 
hold
 
for 
prudential 
purposes
,
 
the opportunity cost of having it 
blocked for the ICL becomes zero
, and
 
having access to a l
arge ICL 
makes it easier
 
for 
banks 
to manage
 
intraday liquidity as it augments the
ir
 
payment capacity.

To understand better how liquidity availability at jurisdiction level relates to the 
use of the ICL, a
 
panel study 
is conducted
.
 
This approach allows 
the value of 
payments settled
,
 
the size of the credit lin
e, the concentration of liquidity,
 
and
 
the 
intraday coordination of payments
 
to be simultaneously taken into account. Given the 
same level of liquidity, jurisdictions that settle more payments should also use the ICL 
more. Use of the ICL could also be high
er if the same liquidity level is available but 
liquidity is concentrated in the hands of fewer participants. The intraday coordination 
of payments is also relevant for the use of the ICL. By synchronising payments, it is 
possible to use liquidity more eff
iciently, and recourse to the ICL should be thus more 
limited. In addition, the overnight interest rate, which gives the cost of liquidity, is 
added as a control. An increase in the cost of liquidity is an incentive for participants to 
make 
 
greater use of
 
intraday credit, which bears no interest.
 
Results show that jurisdictions that hold more liquidity use the 
ICL
 
less.
 
The 
results are statistically significant across specifications (see Table 2
)
. According to the 
most comprehensive specification (specific
ation (3) in Table 2), a 

63 billion increase 
in liquidity (start
-
of
-
day liquidity)
 

 
equivalent to one standard deviation of liquidity 
holdings across countries averaged over time 

 
corresponds to a decrease of 1.3

percentage points in the use of the ICL.
 
The size of the ICL is also negatively 
correlated with its use. This result supports the observation made previously that the 
size of the ICL seems to have a strong supply component, i.e. the jurisdictions that 
hold a large credit line need it less. Regar
ding the concentration of liquidity (Gini 
coefficient), the coefficients are not statistically significant, while the negative 
relationship holds across all specifications. Finally, a 1 percentage point increase in 
the cost of liquidity (the overnight unse
cured rate) corresponds to a 2.5 percentage 
point increase in the use of the ICL.
 
J
urisdictions that are better 
at
 
coordinating their payments use the 
ICL
 
less
.
 
Payment coordination is measured as the time spread that each jurisdiction needs on 
average to 
settle the core 40%
-
60% of their payments.
168
 
This means that as the time 
spread increases, coordination decreases. As expected, jurisdictions in which 
participants better synchronise their incoming payments with outgoing payments 
manage to economise on usage of the liquidity available on their TARGE
T2 accounts 
and are less in need of the ICL (see specifications (2) and (3) in Table 2
)
. An
 
improvement in the coordination of payments by 66 minutes 

 
representing one 
standard deviation in the coordination measure across jurisdictions and averaged 
across
 
time 

 
is reflected in a decrease of 1.1 
percentage points
 
in the use of the 
ICL.

3.2
 
Time of payment settlement
 
The
 
time of payment settlement depends on liquidity availability.
 
In general, 
p
ay
ments are settled soon after they enter the system,
169
 
provided that participants 
have sufficient payment capacity. Higher payment capacity can thus lead to earlier 
settlement, whe
reas
 
a constraint in
 
the payment capacity
,
 
such as during 
time
s
 
of 
stress, 
might lead to later settlement
. 
The degree of c
oncentration of liquidity might 
also affect payment
 
processing
 
if there is a significant discrepancy between the 
participants holding 
most of the liquidity and those sending most payments. Another 
important factor determining the time of payment settlement is active management of 
payment flows on the part of TARGET2 participants, which can support earlier 
settlement by synchronising inco
ming and outgoing payments.
170
 
The timing of 
payment settlement is very important from an operational point of view: the
 
earlier 
payments are 
settle
d, the lower the
 
operational risk. Should 
an 
operational disruption 
occur during 
the day, 
the 
more payments 
ha
ve been 
settled 
up to
 
that point, 
the lower 
the pressure on
 
the system once 
it resumes settlement activity. 
 
The time of payment settlement in TARGET2 has responded to changes in 
liquidity levels over the years.
 
The
 
average time
 
of payment settlement moved
 
during the sovereign debt crisis to 
12:34
 
CET,
 
from
 
12:08 
CET 
in June 2008.
171
 
In 26 
minutes during the sovereign debt crisis 

 
equivalent to the difference between the two 
average times of settlement 

TARGET2 settled payments worth approximately 

84.5 
bill
ion
172
. Also at that time liquidity concentration increased, suggesting that 
fragmentation may have made it more difficult 
for some jurisdictions to fund their 
payments
,
 
owing either to limited liquidity availability or to the reluctance of 
counterparties to send payments to participants that were in need of liquidity. When 
liquidity is limited, payments can spend a longer time in the queue waiting to be 
settled. Since the
 
start of the PSPP and with the consequent increase in liquidity, the 
average time of payment settlement has become earlier, from 12:25 CET in March 
2015 to 11:46 CET in December 2019. In 2019 TARGET2 settled payments worth on 
average 

93.0 billion
173
 
in a 3
9
-
minute interval. 
The
se changes are also reflected in 
the
 
intraday pattern of payment settlement
 
(see Chart 
4
)
. The 
impact of the financial 
and sovereign debt crises is more 
visible in the settlement of payments from the fourth 
up to the eighth decile.
 
At
 
the 
beginning of the day
 
TARGET2 processes a large 
number of 
customer payment
s, whereas interbank activity intensifies later in the 
day.
174
 
As interbank activity is typically more severely affected in situations of financial 
turmoil, it is reasonable to exp
ect a smaller impact on the first payment deciles.
 
                                        
                           
 
169
 
 
In TARGET2, payments are ty
pically processed in less than five minutes (see 
TARGET Annual Report 
2019
, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, May 2020). In other words, less than five minutes pass between the time 
at which the payment enters the system 

 


 
and the time at 
which the payment is 
settled 

 

 
170
 
 
Aside from payments that need to be settled at particular times of the day, such as those related to the 
settlement of ancillary system positions, participants are free to manage their payment flows.
 
171
 
 
TARGET2 operates during 
both 
the day
,
 
between 07:00 CET and 18:00 CET
, and
 
d
uring the night, 
between 19:30 CET and 22:00 CET and between 01:00 CET and 07:00 CET.
 
The average settlement 
time is calculated as a value

Another downward move in the timing of the same set of payments can be observed 
just after the PSPP started, as well as towards the end of 2018 until the first half of 
2019. T

2015, and the consequent 
migration of

),

could have also had an impact 
on the average time
 
of payment settlement, as it res
ulted in 
a
 
shift of 
traffic 
from 
TARGET2 to T2S.
 
Nevertheless, this impact canno
t be disentangled from the impact 
of the PSPP, as the time periods largely overlap.

-
weighted average. 
Technical transactions and liquidity transfers are not included in t

Countries with larger p
ayment capacity 
display on average earlier times of 
payment settlement
.
 
This result emerges from a panel analysis in which t
he 
start

of
-
day balances and ICL (both set and used), TARGET2 traffic,
 
liquidity
 
concentration
 
and
 
the intraday coordination of payments
 
are controlled for (see Table 
3). In addition, time dummies are introduced for 
the period of the sovereign debt crisis 
in 2011
-
12 and for the start of the PSPP in March 2015
. Both start
-
of
-
day liquidity and 
the ICL
 
set 
are
 
negatively correlated with the average time
 
of payment settlement and 
the coefficients are in the same range
. 
In other words, greater
 
payment capacity
 
i
s 
associated with earlier times
 
of payment settlement
. 
On average, a 

63 billion 
increase in liquidity 

 
equivalent to one standard deviation of liquidity holdings across 
countries averaged over time 

 
corresponds to a decrease of approximately four 
minute
s in the average time of payment settlement. 
However, the relationships are not 
consistently significant across specifications.
 
Greater recourse to the ICL (ICL usage) 
is also associated with earlier average times of payment settlement, showing that, 
when 
participants are willing to tap into their credit lines, it is beneficial for the 
settlement process.
 
Jurisdictions with greater 
payment 
coordination tend to experience earlier 
times
 
of payment settlement
.
 
Across all specifications, w
hen payments are 
more 
dispersed over the day
 
(in other words
, less synchronised
),
 
the average time 
of 
payment settlement is later
 
(see 
specifications (2), (3) and (4)
 
in Table 
3
). 
A 66 minute 
decrease in the dispersion of payments results in the average time of payment 
settleme
nt being approximately 11 minutes earlier. Likewise, the higher the 
TARGET2 
traffic
,
 
the later
 
the average
 
time of
 
settlement. 
This seems reasonable: g
iven the 
same level of liquidity,
 
more payments should take longer to be processed.
 
The 
coefficient of l
i
quidity concentration
 
(Gini coefficient)
 
is 
not statistically significant
 
for
 
any 
specification. 
As mentioned above, liquidity concentration might influence the time 
of settlement if there is
 
a significant discrepancy between the participants holding 
most of the liquidity and those sending most payments
. This result suggests that in

TARGET2 liquidity concentration is in line with payment concentration. Finally, higher 
overnight unsecured rates
, which measure the cost of liquidity, lead to later average 
times of payment settlement.

Conclusion
 
Liquidity is essential in the settlement process.
 
This
 
article 
has 
take
n
 
stock of how 
major aspects of 
payment
 
settlement have changed under different liquidity regimes. 
In line with developments 
in
 
excess liqu
idity, the amount of liquidity in TARGET2 
increased by 
approximately eight
 
times between 2008 and 2019, as a direct 
consequence of the monetary policy measures taken. While liquidity levels varied 
throughout this period
,
 
the most visible changes emerged in the context of the 
abundant levels of liquidity 
resulting from
 
the 
extensive asset purchase programme 
carried out by the Eurosystem. 
T
he average time 
of payment settlement was brought 
down from 12:25 CET to 11:46 CET, w
hich has contributed to a reduction in 
operational risk. The payment capacity is 
now 
more balanced
, being 
almost equally 
split between the liquidity available on TARGET2 accounts and intraday credit. The

ICL
 
is used less to settle payments and fewer partic
ipants make use of it.
 
An excessive 
use of the ICL can lead to the use of the marginal lending facility at the end of the day, 
which incurs a cost for the participant. 
While these aspects are beneficial for the 
smooth settlement of payments, 
they should 
no
t be interpreted as essential. Historical 
developments show that TARGET2 was able to set
tle
 
even larger payment value
s
 
than it currently does with less liquidity available
 
in the system
.
 
These observations
,
 
which hold 
for TARGET2 as a whole,
 
are 
also 
true
 
for the 

, 
although
 
heterogeneity exists.
 
66.4
% of the liquidity in 
TARGET2 is held by three jurisdictions, namely Germany, 
France and 
the 
Netherlands. These have very high ICLs
,
 
and ICLs account for a large part of their 
payment capacity
, 
although
 
usage is limited. 
T
he 
size of the 
credit line 
in these 
jurisdictions 
seems to be 
significantly
 
supply
-
driven. Figures for other jurisdictions are 
less conclusive in this respect. As an overview
 
across different periods and 
jurisdictions,
 
the ICL
 
has 
represent
ed
 
between 0.0% and 95.2% of the payment 
capacity, usage of 
the 
ICL 
has 
varie
d
 
between 11.5% and 50
.0
%
,
 
and the share of 
participants using the credit line 
has been
 
between 9.8% and 80.2%. The average 
time 
of payment settlement has 
varie
d
 
bet
ween 08:00 CET and 13:17 CET
, while 
c
oncentration
 
of liquidity has also differed across countries, ranging on average 
between 0.47 and 0.93. Liquidity concentration in TARGET2 is nevertheless broadly in 
line with the concentration of minimum reserves, indi
cating that it is largely a 
consequence of market composition.
 
Across jurisdictions
,
 
larger holdings of liquidity are associated with a 
lower
 
use 
of the 
ICL
 
and an earlier time
 
of settlement
.
 
This conclusion emerges from the 
panel analysis conducted. A 

63
 
billion increase in liquidity 

 
equivalent to one 
standard deviation of liquidity holdings across countries averaged over time 

 
corresponds to a decrease of 1.3 percentage points in the use of the ICL and an 
average time of payment settlement four minute
s earlier. At the same time, an 
improvement in the coordination of payments by 66 minutes 

 
representing one 
standard deviation in the coordination measure across jurisdictions and averaged 
across time 

 
is reflected in a decrease of 1.1 percentage points 
in the use of the ICL 
and an average time of payment settlement 11 minutes earlier. The changes are 
comparable in size, suggesting that improvements beneficial for the settlement 
process can be achieved equally by increasing liquidity or making a greater e
ffort to 
synchronise payments.
