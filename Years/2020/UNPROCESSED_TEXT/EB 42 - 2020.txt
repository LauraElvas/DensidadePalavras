 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 12 March, the Governing Council decided on 
a comprehensive package of monetary policy measures.
 Together with the 
substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures will support 
liquidity and funding co
nditions for households, businesses and banks and will help to 
preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real economy. Since the last Governing 
Council meeting in late January, the spread of the coronavirus (COVID
-19) has been a 
major shock to the gro
wth prospects of the global and euro area economies and has 
heightened market volatility. Even if ultimately temporary in nature, it will have a 
significant impact on economic activity. In particular, it will slow down production as a 
result of disrupted s
upply chains and reduce domestic and foreign demand, especially 
through the adverse impact of the necessary containment measures. In addition, the 
heightened uncertainty negatively affects expenditure plans and their financing. The 
risks surrounding the eu
ro area growth outlook are clearly on the downside. In addition 
to the previously identified risks related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and 
vulnerabilities in emerging markets, the spread of the coronavirus adds a new and 
substantial sourc
e of downside risk to the growth outlook. Against this background, the 
ECB™s Governing Council took a number of policy decisions to preserve the monetary 
stance and to underpin the transmission of monetary poli
cy to the real economy.
 Economic and monetary 
assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 12 March 20
20 The unfolding COVID
-19 epidemic is 
worsening
 the outlook for the global 
economy as embedded in the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections.
 Developments since the cut
-off date 
for the projections suggest that the 
downside risk to global activity related to the COVID
-19 outbreak has partly 
materialised, implying that global activity this year 
will be weaker than envisaged in the 
projections. The outbreak hit the global economy as
 signs of a stabilisation in activity 
and trade had started to emerge and the 
signing 
of the so
-called Phase 1 trade 
agreement between the United States and China, accompanied by cuts in tariffs, had 
reduced uncertainty. Looking further ahead, the projecte
d global recovery is expected 
to gain only modest traction. It will hinge on the recovery in a number of still vulnerable 
emerging market economies
, while the projected cyclical slowdown in advanced 
economies and the structural transition to a slower growt
h trajectory in China will 
weigh on the medium
-term outlook. The risks to global activity have changed, but their 
balance remains tilted to the downside. At the moment, the most acute downside risk 
relates to the potentially broader and longer impact of th
e COVID
-19 outbreak as it 
continues to evolve. Global inflationary pressures remain contained.
 Global risk sentiment deteriorated sharply and market volatility surged as the 
coronavirus spread around the world towards the end of the review period (12

 Overview
  3 Decem
ber 2019 to 11 March 2020).
 Euro area long
-term risk
-free rates declined 
markedly to levels significantly lower than at the start of the period. The forward curve 
of the euro overnight index average (EONIA) shifted sharply downwards; its inversion 
at 
shorter to medium
-term maturities signalled market pricing of further monetary 
policy accommodation. In line with the sharp rise in global risk aversion, euro area 
equity prices decreased strongly, while sovereign and corporate bond spreads 
widened. In vol
atile foreign exchange markets, the euro appreciated substantially 
against the currencies of 38 of the euro area™s most important trading partners.
 Euro area real GDP growth remained subdued at 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the 
fourth quarter of 2019, follo
wing growth of 0.3% in the previous quarter, driven 
by ongoing weakness in the manufacturing sector and slowing investment 
growth.
 Incoming economic data and survey information point to euro area growth 
dynamics at low levels, not 
yet 
fully reflect
ing
 deve
lopments related to the coronavirus, 
which started to spread across continental Europe at the end of February, adversely 
affecting economic activity. Looking beyond the disruption
s stemming from the
 spreading of the
 coronavirus, euro area growth is expecte
d to regain traction over the 
medium term, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal 
stance and the expected
 resumption in global activity.
 According to the 
March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro 
area
, annual r
eal GDP 
is expected 
to increase by 0.8% in 2020, 1.3% in 2021 and 
1.4% in 2022.
 Compared with the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down by 0.3 percentage 
points for 2020 and by 0.1 p
ercentage points for 2021, mainly on account of the 
coronavirus outbreak, although the recent rapid spread of the virus 
in 
the euro area is 
only partly reflected. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are therefore 
clearly on the downside. The
 spread of the coronavirus adds a new and substantial 
source of downside risk to the growth outlook, in addition to risks related to geopolitical 
factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabili
ties in emerging markets.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate,
 euro area annual HICP inflation 
decreased to 1.2% in February 2020, from 1.4% in January.
 On the basis of the 
sharp decline in current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline 
considerably over the coming months.
 This assessment
 is only partly reflected in the 
March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee 
annual HICP inflation at 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022, and are 
broadly unrevised compared to the December 2019 Eurosystem staff 
projections. 
Over the medium term, inflation will be supported by the ECB™s monetary policy 
measures. The implications of the coronavirus for inflation are surrounded by high 
uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker demand may be offset 
by 
upward pressures related to supply disruptions. The recent sharp decline in oil prices 
poses significant downside risks to the short
-term inflation outlook.
 Monetary dynamics have moderated from comfortable levels since late summer 
2019. Credit to the p
rivate sector has continued 
to display 
divergent 
developments across loan categories.
 While lending to households has remained 
resilient, lending to firms has moderated. Favourable bank funding and lending 
conditions 
have 
continued to support lending and t
hereby economic growth. Euro area 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2 / 2020

 Overview
  4 firms™ total net external financing has stabilised, supported by favourable debt 
financing costs. However, the recent increase in risk
-off sentiment is likely to cause 
non
-bank financing conditions for non
-financial corpor
ations to deteriorate.
 The euro area general government budget balance is projected to decline in 
2020 and 2021 and to stabilise in 2022. The decline can be 
largely 
attributed to 
lower primary surpluses.
 These developments are also reflected
 in the project
ions
 in an expansionary fiscal stance in both 2020 and 2021, followed by a broadly neutral 
stance in 2022. Despite the relatively expansionary fiscal stance, 
in the projections
 the 
euro area government debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain on a gradual 
downward path
, owing to a favourable interest rate
-growth differential and a somewhat 
positive primary balance for the entire period.
 Developments related to the spread of 
the coronavirus (COVID
-19) after the projections were finalised point to a clear 
wors
ening of the outlook for the fiscal stance. In addition to previously announced 
fiscal policies, the Eurogroup™s commitment to joint and coordinated policy action 
should be strongly supported in the light of the spread of the virus.
 The m
onetary policy 
package
 On 12 March 2020 the Governing Council decided on a comprehensive package of 
monetary policy measures. The monetary policy response encompassed three key 
elements: first, safeguard
ing
 liquidity conditions in the banking system through a 
series of favo
urably
-priced 
longer
-term refinancing operations (
LTROs
); second, 
protect
ing
 the continued flow of credit to the real economy through a fundamental 
recalibration of 
targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (
TLTROs
); and
, third, 
prevent
ing
 financing conditions for the economy tighten
ing
 in a pro
-cyclical way via an 
increase in the asset purchase programme
 (APP)
.1 1. In times of heightened uncertainty, it is essential that liquidity is provided on 
generous terms to the financial system to preve
nt liquidity squeezes and 
pressure on the price 
of liquidity, 
including
 in times when the coronavirus may 
pose operational risk challenges for participants in the financial system. The 
Governing Council therefore decided to conduct, temporarily, additional
 LTROs 
to provide immediate liquidity support to the euro area financial system. 
Although 
the Governing Council does not see material signs of strains in money markets or 
liquidity shortages in the banking system, these operations will provide an 
effective
 backstop in case of need. 
The operations will be carried out through a 
fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment. They will be priced very 
attractive
ly,
 with an interest rate that is equal to the average rate on the deposit 
facility. These new LTROs
 will provide liquidity 
on 
favourable terms to bridge the 
period until the TLTRO III operation in June 2020.
 2. With revenues and expenditure plans of households and firms being hit by the 
spread of the coronavirus, it is 
crucial 
to support bank lending to th
ose that are 
affected most by the economic ramifications, in particular small and

 Overview
  5 medium
-sized enterprises. Hence, the Governing Council decided to apply 
considerably more favourable terms during the period from June 2020 to June 
2021 to all TLTRO III oper
ations outstanding during that time. Throughout this 
period, the interest rate on these TLTRO III operations will be 25 basis points 
below
 the average rate applied in the Eurosystem™s main refinancing operations. 
For counterparties that maintain their leve
ls of credit provision, the rate applied in 
these operations will be lower, and, over the period ending in June 2021
, can be 
as low as 25 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility. 
Moreover, the maximum total amount that counterp
arties will henceforth be 
entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations 
has been 
raised to 50% of their stock of 
eligible loans as at 28 February 2019. This raises the total possible borrowing 
volume under this programme by more than 
•1 trillion to almost 
•3 trillion in total. 
Overall, the new conditions 
for 
the TLTRO 
will 
help to significantly ease the 
funding conditions that determine the supply of credit provided by banks to firms 
and households. In this context, the Governing Council has mandated the 
Euros
ystem committees to investigate collateral easing measures to ensure that 
counterparties continue to be able to make full use of the ECB™s funding support.
 3. It is essential to ensure a sufficiently
 accommodative monetary 
policy 
stance, 
especially in an envi
ronment of high uncertainty and elevated financial volatility. It 
is against 
this 
background that the Governing Council also decided to add a 
temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of •120 billion until the end 
of the year, ensuring a strong 
contribution from the private sector purchase 
programmes.
 Net asset purchases continue to be expected to run for as long as 
necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of the ECB™s policy rates, and 
to end shortly before the Governing Council starts ra
ising the key ECB interest 
rates. In combination with the existing 
APP, this temporary envelope will support 
financial conditions more broadly and thereby also ease the interest rates that 
matter for the real economy. Moreover, the higher 
pace of 
purchase
s will ensure 
that the Eurosystem shows a more robust presence in the market during 
these 
times of heightened volatility
, including the
 full 
use 
of 
the flexibility embedded in 
the APP to respond to market conditions.
 This could imply temporary fluctuations 
in the distribution of purchase flows both across asset classes and across 
countries in response to ﬁflight to safetyﬂ shocks and liquidity shocks. Such 
deviations from the steady
-state cross
-country allocation are within the remit of 
the programme, 
provid
ed the capital key continues to anchor the total stock of the 
Eurosystem™s holdings in the long run
.  4. In addition, the Governing Council decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged. They are expected to remain at their present or lower levels 
until the 
inflation outlook robustly converges to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% 
within the projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently 
reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
 5. Finally, the Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the 
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an 
extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest

  6 rates, and in any
 case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity 
conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
 In view of current developments, the Governing Council will continue to monitor 
closely the implications of the spread of the coronavi
rus for the economy, for 
medium
-term inflation and for the transmission of monetary policy. The Governing 
Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that 
inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line w
ith its commitment to 
symmetry.
 At the same time, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance is now needed in view of 
the weakened outlook and to safeguard against the further materialisation of downside 
risks. The Governing Council welcomes the measures a
lready taken by several 
governments to ensure sufficient health sector resources and to provide support to 
affected companies and employees. In particular, measures such as providing credit 
guarantees are needed to complement and reinforce the monetary pol
icy measures 
taken by the Governing Council.

 Addendum on the decisions taken by the Governing Council on 18 March
  7 Addendum on the decisions taken by the Governing 
Council on 18 March
 The coronavirus pandemic represents a collective public health emergency that has 
few precedents in recent history. It is also an extreme ec
onomic shock that requires an 
ambitious, coordinated and urgent policy reaction on all fronts. On 18 March, the 
Governing Council announced a new pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(PEPP) to address the unprecedented situation the euro area is facing. T
he 
programme is temporary and will allow the ECB to safeguard
 the transmission of 
monetary policy and ultimately its capacity to deliver price stability in the euro area. In 
particular, developments in financial markets had led to a tightening in financing
 conditions, in particular at the longer
 end of the maturity spectrum. The risk
-free curve 
had moved up and the sovereign yield curves 
Œ which are key to the pricing of all 
assets 
Œ had increased everywhere and become more dispersed. In the fulfilment of 
its mandate, the Governing Council took the following decisions:
 1. To launch a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public 
sector securities to counter the serious risks to the monetary policy transmission 
mechanism and the outlook for the eu
ro area posed by the outbreak and 
escalating diffusion of COVID
-19. This new 
pandemic 
emergency 
purchase 
programme (PEPP) will have an 
overall envelope of •750 billion. Purchases will be conducted until the end of 
2020 and will include all the asset catego
ries eligible under the existing asset 
purchase programme (APP).
 For the purchases of public sector securities, the benchmark allocation across 
jurisdictions will continue to be the capital key of the national central banks. At the 
same time, purchases und
er the new PEPP will be conducted in a flexible 
manner. This allows for fluctuations in the distribution of purchase flows over 
time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions.
 A waiver of the eligibility requirements for securities issued by the Greek 
government will be granted for purchases under PEPP.
 The Governing Council will terminate net asset purchases under PEPP once it 
judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over, but in any case not before the 
end of the year.
 2. To expand the range of eligib
le assets under the corporate sector purchase 
programme (CSPP) to non
-financial commercial paper, making all commercial 
papers of sufficient credit quality eligible for purchase under the CSPP.
 3. To ease the collateral standards by adjusting the main risk pa
rameters of the 
collateral framework. In particular, we will expand the scope of Additional Credit 
Claims (ACC) to include claims related to the financing of the corporate sector. 
This will ensure that counterparties can continue to make full use of the 
Eurosystem™s refinancing operations.

 Addendum on the
 decisions taken by the Governing Council on 18 March
  8 The Governing Council of the ECB is committed to playing its role in supporting all 
citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. To that end, the ECB 
will ensure that all sectors of the economy can b
enefit from supportive financing 
conditions that enable them to absorb this shock. This applies equally to families, 
firms, banks and governments.
 The Governing Council will do everything necessary within its mandate. The 
Governing Council is fully prepare
d to increase the size of its asset purchase 
programmes and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long 
as needed. It will explore all options and all contingencies to support the economy 
through this shock.
 To the extent that some se
lf-imposed limits might hamper action that the ECB is 
required to take in order to fulfil its mandate, the Governing Council will consider 
revising them to the extent necessary to make its action proportionate to the risks that 
we face. The ECB will not to
lerate any risks to the smooth transmission of its monetary 
policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area.

 The unfolding 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) epidemic 
has worsened the outlook for the 
global economy as embedded in the March 2020 ECB
 staff macroeconomic 
projections. Developments since the cut
-off date for the projections suggest that the 
downside risk to global activity related to the COVID
-19 outbreak has partly 
materialised, implying that 
global activity this year 
will
 be weaker than envisaged in the 
aforementioned staff 
macroeconomic projections.
 The outbreak hit the global 
economy as signs of a stabilisation in activity 
and trade had started to emerge and the 
signature of the so
-called Phase 1 trade agreement between 
the 
United States and 
China
, accompanied by cuts in tariffs,
 had reduced uncertainty. 
Looking 
beyond this 
year
, global 
economic activity 
is expected to
 recover yet 
gain only modest traction. 
It 
will
 hinge on 
the 
recovery in a number of still vulnerable 
EME
s, while the projected 
cyclical slowdown in advanced economies and the structural transition to a slower 
growth trajectory in China 
will 
weigh on the medium
-term outlook.
 The risks to global 
activity have changed, but their balance remains tilted to the do
wnside. 
At the 
moment
, the most acute downside risk relate
s to 
the potentially 
broader and longer 
impact of the COVID
-19 outbreak
 as it continues to evolve
. Global inflatio
nary 
pressures remain contained.
 Global economic activity and trade
 The spreading 
of COVID
-19 has clouded the
 global 
outlook
. As the situation is still 
unfolding
 by the day
, it is 
very difficult
 to 
estimate
 how long disruptions to production 
and trade 
will last and how consumers across the globe will respond to the related 
uncertainty. Mo
reover, the outbreak comes after a period of weak global activity. 
Global real GDP growth (excluding the euro area) declined to 2.9% 
last year
, marking 
its slowest pace since the Great Recession. 
This slowdown was broader and more 
pronounced compared to the most recent episodes 
in 2012
-13 and 2015
-16. 
The key 
factor behind it was the r
ecurrent escalation of trade tensions
, which 
Œ through 
increas
ed uncertainty 
Œ prompted
 firms to postpone investment
 and consumers to 
delay purchases of durable goods
. This in turn resulted in a sharp decline in global 
manufacturing activity and trade
. In addition, several EMEs were hit by idiosyncratic 
shocks, which further accentuated 
the 
decelerati
on in global activi
ty last year. At the 
same time, a number of key advanced and emerging market economies deployed 
demand
 stimulating policies, thereby limiting both the pace and depth of the slowdown
 in growth in 2019
. The outbreak hit the global economy as signs of 
a stabi
lisation in activity and 
trade 
had 
started to emerge.
 The global composite 
output 
Purchasing Managers™ 
Index 
(PMI
) (excluding the euro area) increased in January, supported by better 
readings for both the manufacturing and services sectors. Stronger output
 in the 
manufacturing sector signal
led
 that a nascent recovery 
Œ following a protracted period 
of weakness 
Œ could be underway. 
These
 signals 
were
 mostly visible for EMEs, while 
developments in advanced economies 
have been
 more mixed.
 This 
trend 
was 
recent

measures, manufactu

activity
 in China plunged in February
 and some negative 
spillovers were felt across the Asia
-Pacific region, which is intrinsically linked to China 
through supply chains and is also one of the most popular destinations for Chinese 
tourists. Yet 
wider 
global spillovers 
in February were likely 
limited, as suggested by 
the
 relative stability 
of the global 
manufacturing 
PMI excluding China (see Chart 1)
. However, as production in China is only gradually returning to normal 
and many 
countries have imposed measures to contain the spreading of the virus, a 
more 
persistent a
nd 
broader
 impact on global manufacturing activity in the near term can be 
expected.

 Notes: The latest observations are for 
February 2020.
 Following a period of easing, g
lobal financial conditions 
have markedly 
tightened more recently.
 The previous easing
 period followed the announcement of 
the aforementioned Phase 1 
trade agreement, which in turn spurred a rally in risky 
assets. This
 rally was interrupted abruptly around 
mid
-February when global equity 
markets plunged as the outbreak continued to weigh on China and spread to other 
countries. 
Since the 
cut
-off date for
 the 
March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections, global financial conditions markedly tightened both in advanced 
economies and 
EMEs
 as the impact of the sharp correction in equity markets and the 
increase in corporate bond spreads was only partly 
outwe
ighed by declining risk
-free 
rates. In 
EMEs
 the tightening was less pronounced 
compared to
 recent episodes of 
financial stress, 
such as in
 the summer of 2018, as 
EMEs
™ exchange rates remained 
broadly stable against the US dollar. The latter mainly reflecte
d the actual and 
expected monetary policy easing measures 
taken 
by the Federal Reserve which 
weighed on the US dollar, offsetting the upward pressure emanating from the safe 
haven inflows into US Treasuries.

higher than
 the 2.9% estimated for 2019. Over the medium term
, global growth 
is expected
 to 
increase
 slightly to 3.5% and 3.4% in 2021 and 2022 respectively, below 
its long
-term average of 3.8%. Compared to the December 
2019 Eurosystem staff

projections
, global growth projections for 2020 
are
 broadly 
unchanged
, as upward revisions related to lower trade tariffs 
are
 offset
 by downward 
revisions in 2020Q1 owing to the virus outbreak in China.
 In the March projections, t
he 
medium
-term outlook for the global
 economy hinge
d on the recovery in a number of 
EMEs
. Yet the path to recovery in th
ese
 countries 
is judged to be 
fragile amid external 
headwinds which
, together
 with domestic political instability
, could derail the
ir recovery 
prospects. Developments since 
the cut
-off date indeed suggest that an imminent 
downside risk related to the COVID
-19 impact on the global economy has partly 
materialised. This in turn implies that global activity this year is very likely to be weaker 
than envisaged in the March 2020 EC
B staff macroeconomic projections.
 In the United States, economic activity 
was
 expected 
to remain steady in the 
near 
term
. Real GDP 
grew 
by 
2.1% on an annualised basis
 in the fourth quarter of 
2019, keeping
 pace with
 the 
previous
 quarter. Consumption growt
h slowed 
by 
more 
than expected and business fixed investment declined for the third consecutive 
quarter. 
The halt 
in the production of the Boeing 737 Max
 is 
expected to weigh on 
manufacturing activity in the first quarter
 of 2020. Looking further ahead, g
rowth 
was
 expected to 
decrease amidst 
a maturing business cycle and the fading impact of the 
2018 tax reform. 
Annual headline 
consumer price 
inflation 
declined slightly
 to 2.
3% in 
February
 from 2.
5% in the previous month. Excluding food and energy, annual inflation 
ticked up to 2.4% from
 a 2.3% 
level recorded over the previous four months. 
Inflation 
is 
expected to increase
 gradually above the Fed™s 2% target by the end of the forecast 
horizon. 
On Ma
rch 3, following an emergency meeting, the Federal Reserve cut its 
policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 1
-1.25%, citing the risk the outbreak is posing 
to economic activity. Further measures, including liquidity provisions as well as 
additional fisca
l spending, were enacted in order to tackle the impact of the outbreak 
on the economy.
 In China
, activity 
is expected to weaken considerably in the first quarter and 
recover thereafter.
 Over
 the medium term, real GDP is expected to remain on a 
gradual slow
ing trajectory. A
nnual GDP growth for 2019 
decelerated
 to 6.1% from 
6.6% in 2018, driven by less supportive investment and net trade.

-19 outbreak
 will dominate 
in the near
 term
, while lower tariffs in the context of 
the trade agreem
ent with the United States are expected to support trade. 
Over the 
medium
 term, progress with the implementation of structural reforms is expected to 
facilitate an orderly slowdown and some reba
lancing of the Chinese economy. Since 
the cut
-off date for pro
jections, incoming data in China suggest that the slowdown in 
the first quarter could be stronger than expected. In addition, a more gradual return of 
production to normality indicates that the recovery of activity could take somewhat 
longer than 
envisaged
 in the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projection
s. A number of economic policy measures have been enacted in China since the outbreak 
started, including, among others, more accommodative monetary policy and 
additional fiscal spending.

  12 In Japan
, econom
ic activity contracted significantly in 
the fourth quarter,
 reflecting 
a confluence of negative shocks, including 
a fall in 
domestic demand 
as a 
result of
 the 
consumption tax 
hike, production disruptions caused by 
powerful 
typhoons in October
 and weak exte
rnal demand. The negative spillovers from the 
coronavirus outbreak in China, which hit the Japanese economy through a significant 
decline 
in inbound tourism spending during the Lunar New Year holidays, coupled with 
early signs of potential supply chain dis
ruptions
, are expected to weigh on activity in 
the first quarter
. Furthermore, the Japanese authorities enacted a number of 
measures to contain the COVID
-19 outbreak in the country, which jointly with more 
cautious behaviour by consumers, is expected to we
igh on economic activity. In 
reaction to this, the Japanese government has responded with two emergency fiscal 
packages, including measures to support SMEs. The Bank of Japan stated that it is 
closely monitoring developments and stands ready to provide liq
uidity and ensure 
stability in financial markets. F
iscal stimulus 
measures 
announced by the Japanese 
authorities in 
late
 2019 are
 expected to support growth in 2020
-2021. In the United Kingdom, 
activity was expected to recover in the first quarter.
 However
, the economic impact of COVID
-19 will likely result in a renewed slowdown in 
the second quarter. 
Real
 GDP growth was flat in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting
 a continued 
slow
ing in the 
underlying momentum seen earlier in 
the year
 and 
a broader 
deceleration seen since the 2016 
referendum. Domestic demand had slowed 
markedly in the second half of 2019 against a backdrop of high Brexit
-related 
uncertainty and a general election campaign in the 
last
 quarter
 of the year
. While 
sentiment 
had 
improved markedly following the decisive results of the general election 
and the subsequent conclusion of an orderly withdrawal from the European Union at 
the end of January, 
a strong turnaround in activity in 2020 
had not been anticipated, 
even before the
 outbreak, given the remaining uncertainties surrounding the future of
 UK-EU trade negotiations.
 In response to the COVID
-19 outbreak, the Bank of 
England cut its policy rate by 50 basis points to 0.25% and introduced a targeted 
lending programme aimed at 
small and medium
-sized enterprises, while the draft 
budget proposed by the government includes a number of fiscal measures to tackle 
the economic impact of the outbreak.
 In central and eastern European countries
, economic activity 
was
 expected
 to 
moderate
 from above
-potential growth rates
. This 
moderation reflected mainly 
slower investment growth 
against the backdrop of a more advanced phase of the EU 
funds cycle
, while 
consumer spending 
was expected to be 
underpinned by 
solid
 labour markets
. Economic
 activ
ity in large commodity
 exporting countries
 was expected to 
strengthen somewhat this year.
 In Russia
, economic 
activity 
picked up in the course 
of 
2019 and had been
 expected to 
accelerate further on the back of additional social 
spending decided upon by the
 new government
. However, downside risks loom large 
as the global spread of the C
OVID
-19 virus
, the recent 
collapse
 of the OPEC+ 
agreement
, and a sharp decline in oil prices
 render the outlook unusually uncertain.
 The medium
-term outlook is primarily shaped by uncertainty 
regarding
 additional 
international sanctions as well as the policy priorities of the recently appointed 
government. GDP ha
d been revised upwards in the near term, largely on the back of 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2 / 2020
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 External environment
  13 higher publ
ic spending.
 In Brazil, economic 
sentiment started to improve in 
the fourth 
quarter
. However, growth remains subdued 
owing to 
tight fiscal 
constraints
 (including 
budget freezes) and an uncertain external environment
, a situation that recently 
worsened with
 the increasing spread of the 
COVID
-19 virus
. The degree to which 
additional necessary fiscal reforms are implemented will significantly influence growth 
prospects in the medium
 term. At the same time, fiscal imbalances remain a 
principal
 source of risk sh
ould they fail to be addressed.
 Therefore
 adhering to 
fiscal rules such 
as the spending cap ceiling mak
es large fiscal stimulus less likely.
 In Turkey, activity 
levels 
continue to recover strongly from the recent 
crisis
-related recession.
 Real GDP growth i
n annual terms moved into positive 
territory in the third quarter and strengthened further in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Expansionary fiscal policy and rapid credit expansion drove the robust growth in 
household consumption
 and
 the bottoming out of privat
e sector investment
. They are 
both
 expected to continue fostering growth this year. Notwithstanding this, growth 
rates remain relatively low in historical terms given the 
economy™s 
weakened potential.
 Signs of 
a stabilisation 
in global trade 
had 
bec
ome vis
ible 
in 
late 2019.
 Global 
imports turned out to be stronger owing largely to buoyant import growth in Turkey, 
China and other 
EMEs
. In contrast, weaker
-than
-expected import data for advanced 
economies in 2019Q4 reflect
ed a number of idiosyncratic shocks ex
pected to 
dissipate over the near
 term. In Japan
, these factors relate to a contraction 
in domestic demand following the consumption tax hike and the impact of 
a powerful 
typhoon. In the United Kingdom and the United States
, they reflect the unwinding of 
previous
ly accumulat
ed inventories. 
The d
iverging development 
in trade between 
advanced economies and EMEs was 
also 
evident from merchandise trade data. 
Overall, global merchandise imports 
contracted
 by 0.
7% in 
the fourth qua
rter of 2019 
(see Chart 2). However, the COVID
-19 outbreak is expected to delay the stabilisation 
of global trade, weighing on the global manufacturing sector in particular, as 
evidenced by the latest survey data. As the virus continues to spread globally,
 its 
impact on trade will be more significant than envisaged in the March 2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections.

 The indices and

 The recent signing of the so
-called Phase
 1 trade deal between the United 
States and China 
offers
 a respite from trade tensions.
 Under 
this deal
, both 
countries reduced 
their 
bilateral trade tariffs
, and China 
made a 
commitm
ent
 to 
purchase an additional USD
 200 billion
 in goods and services from the U
nited 
States
 over the next two years. While this partial de
-escalation of their trade conflict supports 
the recovery in global manufacturing activity and trade, uncertainty about the future 
course of 
global 
trade policies remains 
high.
 The g
lobal trade outlook remains
 weak by historical standards
, as the trade 
elasticity of income is expected to remain below its 
ﬁnew normal
ﬂ of unity.
2 This 
reflects a confluence of factors, including
, for example
, the 
higher tariff rates enacted 
to date and elevated policy uncertainty.
 According to the March 2020 ECB
 staff 
macroeconomic projections
, global import growth (excluding the euro area) 
is expected to pick
 up gradually from 0.3% last year to 1.4% in 2020, before 
rising
 to 
2.6% and 2.7% in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Euro area f
oreign demand 
is projected 
to increase by 1.6% this year, before accelerating to 2.5% and 2.6% in 2021 and 2022 
respectively. While euro area foreign demand 
has been
 revised upwards for 2020
, compared 
to the December 
2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
pro
jections
, th
is revision relate
s mainly to upside surprises in the second half of 2019 as well as higher 
bilateral imports 
between
 the United States and China resulting from 
the 
lower tariffs 
implemented 
under 
the Phase
1 agreement
. As the latter mostly supp
orts bilateral 
trade between the two countries, it shall not be treated as a signal of higher foreign 
demand for goods and services produced in the euro area. Taking these factors into 
consideration, euro area foreign demand 
in the March projections is
 exp
ected to be 
broadly in line with the December projections for this year and next.
 Developments 
since the cut
-off date for projections suggest that the unfolding global COVID
-19

 External environment
  15 epidemic is weighing on global trade and accordingly on euro area foreign deman
d. 
Taking them into account would imply that 
global 
imports and euro area foreign 
demand will
 be weaker than envisaged in the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections.
 The r
isks to 
the 
global 
activity
 outlook have
 changed
, but 
their balance 
remain
s tilted
 to the downside.
 The new and currently most acute downside risk relates to the 
potentially broader and longer impact of the still unfolding COVID
-19 outbreak. 
Developments in the global economy since the cut
-off date for the projections suggest 
that
 this downside risk has already partly materialised.
3 Downside risks stemming 
from trade tensions have abated somewhat following the 
Phase
 1 deal, but 
uncertainty 
about the future path of 
global 
trade policies remains elevated. The risk of a no
-deal 
Brexit
 has been pushed 
back 
to the end of the 
year 
and will depend on 
the outcome of 
the EU
-UK negotiation
s over their future relationship. Moreover, a sharper slowdown 
in China could be increasingly difficult to counteract with policy stimulus and 
could
 prove a
 challenge to the ongoing rebalancing process. Repricing of risk 
by the
 financial markets might weigh negatively on global activity, especially on EMEs.
 Global price developments
 Oil prices 
have significantly decreased as 
worries about global demand 
intens
ified against the background
 of the unfolding epidemic.
 Discord among 
members of the OPEC+ alliance regarding production cuts further accentuated this 
decline. Initially, o
il 
prices were 
hit hardest by 
news of 
the outbreak
 in China in late 
January. They 
recovered somewhat 
for a short period of time, but started to decline as 
the virus 
began to 
spread 
across the globe.
 In early March, the OPEC+ alliance 
between OPEC and some major non
-OPEC countries broke down
 as Russia refused 
to implement
 cuts
 to oil produ
ction
. Saudi Arabia responded to this by announcing an 
increase in production and by offering oil at a discount, in order to gain market shares. 
This resulted in one of the biggest one
-day drops in oil prices recorded to date
. In the March 20
20 ECB staff m
acroeconomic projections, oil prices 
were
 expected
 to remain relatively stable over the projection horizon.
 Declining
 spot 
prices had moved the short end of the oil futures curve down further compared to the 
longer end, resulting in a flattening of the curve over the projection horizon. 
Compared 
with the December 2019 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the oil p
rice 
assumptions were 
5.5%, 3.2% and 2.5% 
lower for 
2020, 2021 and 
2022 respectively
. Since the cut
-off date for the 
March
 projections, the price of oil has 
declined
 significantly
, with Brent crude standing at USD
 34.5
 per barrel on 
11 March
. Global inflat
ion remains subdued, reflecting the growth dynamics.
 In countries 
belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD), 
annual consumer price inflation 
recorded an uptick
 to 2.1% in December 
2019 from 
1.8% in the previous month (
see Chart 3). Annual energy price inflation bounced back 
in December after being in negative territory for four consecutive months, while food

 Global risk sentiment deteriorated sharply and market volatility surged as the 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) spread around the world towards the end of the review period 
(12 December 2019 to 11 March 2020)
. Euro area long
-term
 risk
-free rates 
declined 
markedly to levels significantly lower than at the start of the 
period
, while spreads 
between sovereign bonds in the euro area increased tangibly towards the end of the 
review period. T
he forward curve
 of the euro overnight index average (EONIA)
 shifted 
sharply down
wards
; its inversion at shorter to medium
-term maturities signals market 
pricing of further monetary policy accommodation.
 In line with the sharp rise in global 
risk aversion, euro area e
quity prices 
decreased 
strongly, while sovereign a
nd corporate bond spreads widened
. In volatile
 foreign exchange markets, the euro 
appreciated substantially 
against the currencies of 38 of the euro area™s most 
important trading partners
. Long
-term 
sovereign 
yields 
decreased significantly over the euro ar
ea as a whole and across the globe (see Chart 4) amid high volatility
. Movements in 
average euro area sovereign yields can be divided into three distinct phases. Between 
12 December 2019 and mid
-January 2020, yields increased slightly amid improved 
global 
risk sentiment and some perceived bottoming
-out of macroeconomic indicators. 
During the second phase, up until 21 February 2020, coronavirus
-related news and 
disappointing macroeconomic releases led to a downturn in risk sentiment and 
sovereign yields star
ted to decrease on average. In the most recent phase, sovereign 
yields suffered a further significant decline as the coronavirus started spreading 
around the world and concerns about its economic and social repercussions began to 
rattle global financial ma
rkets. Over the review period as a whole, the GDP
-weighted 
euro area ten
-year sovereign bond yield decreased by 33 basis points to return to 
negative territory at 
-0.12%. The ten
-year sovereign bond yields in the United States 
and the United Kingdom also d
ecreased, to 0.88% and 0.27% (down 102 and 54 basis 
points) respectively, mainly reflecting global concerns about the coronavirus and the 
expected monetary policy reaction coupled with flight
-to-safety movements into 
risk
-free assets.

  22 In foreign exchange markets, the euro 
appreciated substantially in
 trade
-weighted terms
 (see Chart 9) amid increased volatility.
 The nominal 
effective exchange rate of the euro, 
as 
measured against the currencies of 38 of the 
euro area™s most important trading partners, 
appreciated 
by 
2.6
% over the review 
period
. Regardin
g bilateral exchange rate developments, the euro appreciated 
strongly (by 1.8%) against the US dollar, albeit in an environment of heightened 
volatility. The US dollar had strengthened during the first half of February, partly on 
account of greater uncerta
inty around the global economic outlook but started to 
weaken in late February on expectations of monetary policy easing in the United 
States, a trend that continued after the Fed rate cut in early March and as 
coronavirus
-related news continued to worsen.
 At the same time, the euro appreciated 
very strongly against the pound sterling (by 3.7%) and also strengthened vis
-à-vis 
most other currencies, including those of non
-euro area EU Member States and major 
emerging economies. The euro depreciated significa
ntly against the Swiss franc (by 
3.2%) and the Japanese yen (by 2.0%) in line with the decline in risk appetite.

 Euro area real GDP growth 
remained subdued at 0.1%, quarter on quarter, 
in the 
fourth 
quarter of 201
9, following growth of 0.3% in the previous quarter, driven by 
ongoing weakness in the 
manufacturing sector and slowing investment growth
. Incoming economic data and survey information point to euro area growth dynamics
 at 
low levels
. However, they do not yet
 fully reflect 
developments related to
 the 
coronavirus (COVID
-19),
 which started to 
spread across 
continental Europe
 at the end 
of February, 
adversely affecting economic activity.
 Looking beyond the disruption
s stemming from the
 spread of the
 coronavirus
, euro area growth is expected to regain 
traction over the medium term, supported by f
avourable financing conditions, the euro 
area fiscal stance and the expected resumption in global activity.
 The 
March
 2020 ECB
 staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
expect
 annual real GDP 
to 
increas
e by 
0.8
% in 20
20, 1.3
% in 202
1 and 1.4
% in 20
22. Compared with the 
Dec
ember 
2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real 
GDP growth has been revised
 down by 0.3 percentage points for 2020 and by 0.1 
percentage points for 2021, mainly on account of the coronavirus outbreak, al
though 
the 
recent rapid spread of the 
virus
 to the euro area
 is only partly reflected. 
The risks 
surrounding the euro area growth outlook are 
therefore 
clearly on the downside. 
The spread of the coronavirus adds a new and substantial source of downside ris
k to the 
growth outlook
, in addition to risks related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism 
and vuln
erabilities in emerging markets
. Growth
 in the euro area 
moderated
 in the 
fourth
 quarter of 201
9, reflecting 
ongoing weakness in the manufacturing 
sector
. Real GDP 
increased
 by 0.
1%, 
quarter on quarter, in the 
fourth
 quarter of 
2019, compared with 0.3% in the previous
 quarter (see Chart 10). 
Subdued growth 
in the 
fourth
 quarter 
was
 driven by a sharp 
contraction in the 
manufacturing 
sector, while the 
services and construction sectors 
continued to exhibit more resilient dynamics
. Domestic
 demand 
made a positive 
contribution to growth of 1.0 percentage point, while net exports and c
hanges in 
inventories
 contributed negatively by 0.8 and 0.1 percentage po
ints, respectively
. Overall, output growth in the fourth quarter led to a yearly rise in GDP of 1.2% in 2019, 
down from 1.9% in 2018.

 Notes: 
The latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2019.
 Employment continued to increase in the 
fourth 
quarter of 
2019, rising by 0.
3% quarter on quarter (see Chart 11).
 Most euro area countries 
saw an
 increase 
in 
employment, but this was more concentrated in the construction and services sectors
. The level of employment
 currently
 stands 
at almost 4.3
% above the pre
-crisis peak 
recorded in the first quarter of 2008. 
Taking 
into account
 the latest increase, 
there has 
been 
cumulative 
growth in 
employment in the euro area
, with 12.0 million more people 
in employment than at the time of
 the trough 
in 
the second quarter of 2013.
 The 
positive 
development
 in employment growth in 
the fourth quarter of 
2019 contrasts 
with the background of weaker real activity, with labour productivity per person 
employed decreasing by 0.2%. The higher than expected employme
nt growth in the 
euro area 
could also be consistent with the resilience of the
 more labour intensive 
domestic demand, 
compared
 with the weaker growth in the less labour i
ntensive 
external trade sector.
 Despite stable readings from recent s
hort
-term labour market indicators
 so far 
in 
the f
irst 
quarter of 
2020, short term 
employment 
dynamics remain dependent 
on the impact of the coronavirus
. The euro area unemployment rate stood at 
7.4
% in 
January 2020
, unchanged from 
the fourth quarter of 2019
, and remains at 
its
 lowest 
level since 
July 
2008. Survey indicators point to 
further increas
es in 
employment in the 
first 
quarter of 20
20, with the Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) employment

 is expressed as a deviation from 50 divided by 10. The latest observations are for the 
fourth 
quarter of 201
9 for employment, 
February
 2020 for the PMI and 
January 
2020 for the unemployment rate.
 Private consumption 
continued to grow in the fourth
 quarter of 201
9, albeit at a 
slower pace than in the previous quarter.
 Private consumption increased by 
0.1
%, 
quarter on quarter, in the 
fourth
 quarter of 201
9, following somewhat 
stronger
 growth 
in the 
third
 quarter. The 
recent 
weakness in household expe
nditure partly reflected 
calendar effects in December
. Employment growth strengthened in the fourth quarter 
of 2019 in an environment of robust wage increases. This implies steady growth in 
households™ real disposable income and supports consumer confidenc
e and 
spending. In addition, while financing conditions remain very favourable, households™ 
net worth improved in the third quarter of 2019.
 Available short
-term indicators
 suggest some 
resilience in private consumption
 in early 2020, but this is subject t
o the spread of the coronavirus in Europe.
 Recent data on retail sales indicate moderate but steady growth in consumer 
spending, with some volatility being recorded around the turn of the year.
 The volume 
of retail sales 
increased by 0.6% in January 2020, 
following 
a drop
 of 1.1% 
in 
December 2019. In addition, consumer confidence increased for a second 
consecutive month in February 2020. The latest improvement reflects 
households™ 
more benign views 
regarding
 their past and future financial situation
. Consum
er 
confidence remains above its historical average and is consistent with ongoing steady 
growth in private consumption. However, recent measures to contain the spread of the 
coronavirus are expected to have a significant impact on consumption going forward
. The recovery in housing markets is
 expected to
 continue at a slower pace
 than 
in 2019 and
 to be 
negatively affected by
 the 
coronavirus
 outbreak
. Housing 
investment 
increased 
by 
0.4%, quarter on quarter, 
in the 
fourth quarter of 2019
, reflecting 
a moderat
ion in the growth momentum 
in euro area
 housing markets
. Although housing investment growth decreased for the third consecutive year in 2019,

for
 the 
past few months point to positive, albeit 
weakening, momentum in the fourth 
quarter of 201
9 and early 2020
. The PMI for housing activity averaged 5
0.6
 in the 
fourth quarter of 2019 and 52.6 in January and February 2020
. Business investment
 growth in the euro area

 masking a slowdown in machinery and equipment investment and large swings 
in intangible investment.
 Non
-construction investment grew by 8.0%
, quarter 
on quarter,
 in 
the fourth quarter of 
2019, on account of a 20% quarterly rise in investment 
in intellectu
al property products, mainly related to Ireland
. Meanwhile, quarterly 
machinery and equipment investment growth slowed in 2019 and contract
ed in 
the 
fourth quarter
, an outcome which was mirrored in 
the 
particularly weak i
ndustrial 
production of capital goo
ds in that quarter. 
The loss 
of momentum partly reflects 
remaining elevated economic uncertainty and 
weaker
 demand conditions.

and February 2020 t

nd production 
expectations in the capital goods sector 
improve
d somewhat, according to information 
collected before the outbreak of the 
coronavirus
 in Europe. 
With regard to confidence 
indices for the capital goods sector, the PMI for January and the Economic Sentiment 
Indicator (ESI) for February increased from thei
r levels in the fourth quarter of 2019, 
but remained below historical averages.
 Forward
-looking indicators such as 
manufacturing uncertainty 
edged down in 
January, 
and the decline in the 
earnings 
expectations 
of listed companies 
came to a halt in February
. Recovering profits, 
favourable 
financing conditions and 
ample corporate 
liquidity 
buffers should also 
support a gradual recovery in investment growth
. While extra
-euro area goods exports recovered in
 the fourth quarter of
 2019, 
driven by improvements vis
-à-vis emerging market economies
, this 
recovery 
is 
likely to be reversed in 
the first quarter of 
2020 owing
 to the impact of 
the 
coronavirus
 outbreak
. Nominal
 extra
-euro area exports of goods increased by 1.3%
, quarter on q
uarter,
 in the fourth quarter of
 2019. In particular, exports to Turkey, Brazil
, China
 and the rest of Asia recovered at the end of 
2019. However
, exports of 
goods to 
the United States and the United Kingdom weakened in the same period 
owing
 to 
lower expor
ts of pharmaceuticals and the winding down of inventories
 previously built 
up in relation to Brexit
, respectively
. Intra
-euro area trade 
remained
 anaemic, 
reflecting weakness in euro area industrial production and investment. Looking ahead, 
available
 leadi
ng indicators 
point to
 a decline in
 exports 
as a result
 of the 
coronavirus
. The PMI on new euro area export orders for February
 2020
 dropped 
sharply
, and 
shipping indicators (e.g. the Baltic Dry Index) reversed significantly in their latest 
releases. 
These
 indicators do not 
yet 
incorporate the effects of 
the 
coronavirus
 outbreak in Italy and other euro area countries. The impact of the 
coronavirus
 on euro 
area trade is expected to 
materialise
 through
 disruptions 
to extra
- and intra
-euro 
area 
supply chains, lower foreign demand, a deterioration 
in confidence and a 
sharp 
decline
 in services
 such as tourism and transport.
 Incoming economic data and survey information point to some stabilisation in 
euro area growth, albeit at low levels
, but 
do not fully 
reflect developments 
related to the

increased in February 2020, with improvements in both manufacturing and 
services components, putting the average for the first two months 
of 2020
 above that 
for the fourth quarter of 2019 (
51.4 compared with 50.7). 
The European Commission™s 
ESI increased i
n February, standing 
above its long
-term average
. So far in 2020 the 
average stands at 103.0, above the average of 100.6 in the fourth qua
rter of 2019. 
Although the ESI declined for the construction sector and softened slightly for the retail 
sector, this was broadly offset by improved sentiment in the manufacturing and 
services sectors and in households. Despite signs 
of 
stabilisation in su
rvey data, 
supplier delivery times and business expectations in the surveys up to February 
already indicated constraints on euro area activity owing to the impact of the 
coronavirus
 in China. Developments related to the spread of the virus
 following the 
outbreak in 
Europe
 could lead to 
further 
supply chain
 disruptions and affect both 
consumption and investment, owing to very high levels of uncertainty and increased 
financial market volatility.

 Compared with the December 2019 Eurosystem

points for 2020 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2021, mainly on account of the 
coronavirus outbreak, although the recent rapid spread of the virus to
 the euro area is 
only partly reflected. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are therefore 
clearly on the downside. The spread of the coronavirus adds a new and substantial 
source of downside risk to the growth outlook, in addition to risks 
related to geopolitical 
factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 
1.2% in February 2020, from 1.4% in January. On the basis of the 
recent 
sharp decline 
in current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to declin
e considerably 
over the coming months. This assessment is only partly reflected in the March 2020 
ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP 
inflation at 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022
, and are 
broadly 
unrevised 
compared to the December 2019 Eurosystem staff projections
. Over the medium term 
inflation will be supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures
. The implications of 
the coronavirus for inflation are surrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward 
pressures linked to weaker demand may be offset by upward pressures related to 
supply disruptions. The recent sharp decline in oil prices poses signi
ficant downside 
risks to the short
-term inflation outlook.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, HICP inflation 
decreased
 in February
. The decrease from 1.4% in January to 1.2% in February reflected a decline in energy 
inflation, which more than offset i
ncreases in food, services and non
-energy industrial 
goods inflation. While energy inflation remained the main driver of headline inflation 
dynamics, food inflation, at rates of more than 2%, has recently contributed 
substantially to the level of inflation

 Note: The latest observations are for

 staff macroeconomic projections 
foresee an increase in

2, broadly 
unrevised fr
om the
 December 
2019 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections (see 
Chart 17). 
The weaker headline inflation rate in 2020 compared with 2019 reflects a 
notable drop in HICP energy prices given weak developments in oil prices (up to the 
cut
-off date for th
e technical assumptions
 of 18 February
), partly on account of the 
COVID
-19 outbreak. 
HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to move 
sideways at 1.2% in the course of 2020 and strengthen gradually to 1.4% in 2021 and 
1.5% in 2022. 
Beyond the impact on the oil price, the implications of the spread of 
COVID
-19 for inflation are surrounded by considerable uncertainty. It is assumed in 
the projections that the downward pressures on prices related to weaker demand in 
2020 will be
 largely
 offset by upward effects related to supply disruptions, although this 
assessment is subject to clear downside risks.

  33 5 Money and credit
 Monetary dynamics have moderated
 from comfortable levels 
since late summer
 2019. 
Credit to the private sector has continued displaying divergent developments across 
loan categories. While lending to households has remained resilient, lending to firms 
has moderated. F
avourable
 bank funding and lending conditions 
continued to support 
lending and thereby 
economic growth
. Euro area firms™ total net external financing 
has 
stabilised, supported by favourable debt financing costs. However, the recent increase 
in risk
-off sentiment is 
likely to cause non
-bank financing conditions for non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs) to deteriorate.
 Monetary dynamics have moderated since late summer 2019.
 The annual growth 
rate of M3 
increased to 5.2% in January, from 4.9% in December (see Chart 18), 
mainly on account of a positive base effect related to marketable instruments, which 
concealed the continued moderation of shorter
-term monetary dynamics. Broad 
money growth was supported by the very low opportunity cost of holding monetary 
instruments. By c
ontrast, the slowdown in
 economic 
growth has acted as a drag on M3 
growth. As
 in previous quarters, M3 growth continued to be 
mainly 
driven by the
 narrow aggregate M1
, which comprises
 overnight deposits and currency in circulation
. The annual growth rate o
f M1 reached 7.9% in January, after
 8.0% in December.

 Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notion
al cash pooling. The latest observation is for 
January 2020.
 Overnight deposits
 remained the main contributor to money growth
. The
 annual 
growth rate
 of overnight deposits remained broadly stable in January, at 8.4%, after 
8.5% in December, while its contr
ibution to annual M3 growth has moderated 
somewhat since the autumn of 2019; from a sectoral perspective, overnight deposits 
placed by firms and by households contributed to this moderation. The annual growth 
rate of
 currency in circulation 
continued to ho
ver around 5% in January and does not 
point to an accelerated substitution of 
deposits with cash in the
 prevailing low
-interest 
rate environment.
 The small increase in annual M3 growth in January was mainly 
owing to m
arketable instruments (i.e.
 M3 minus 
M2)
, which contributed positively to

marketable 
instruments 
on M3 in December, owing to the strongly negative net debt securities 
issuance that month, which may have reflected end
-of-year effec
ts.
 Credit to the private sector remained the main source of broad money creation
. Credit to the private sector
 continued to make a stable, sizeable contribution to broad 
money growth in January 
(see the 
blue
 portion of the 
bars in 
Chart
 19). The annual 
contribution of credit to the private sector up to January 2020 largely reflected robust 
annual loan growth
. External monetary flows
 were the second main source of money 
creation, which have provided a broadly stable contribution to M3 since November 
2019, r
eflecting investors™ preference for euro area assets (see the yellow portion of 
the bars in Chart 19). The resumption of the ECB™s net asset purchases under the 
asset purchase programme (APP) in November has had only a limited direct impact 
on M3 in its fi
rst three months; this is potentially on account of banks and 
non
-residents being among the main sellers of bonds to the Eurosystem. The 
resumption of net asset purchases has also not compensated the drag on M3 growth 
coming from the maturing of non
-APP re
lated debt securities 
(see the 
red
 portion of 
the 
bars in
 Chart

-term financial liabilities remained small

  35 of loans to firms has stabilised at 3.2%, thus confirming its moderation since 
September 2018. The considerable
 heterogeneity
 in loan growth across countries 
reflects, inter alia, cross
-country differences in economic growth, variations in the 
availabi
lity of other funding sources, the level of indebtedness of households and 
firms, and heterogeneity in house price developments across countries 
(see Chart
 20). The
 moderation in 
the
 growth
 of loans
 to firms is in line with its lagging cyclical 
pattern wit
h res
pect to real economic activity.
 The moderation 
in bank lending to 
firms continues to be concentrated in 
the manufacturing and trade
 sectors
, which are 
particularly affected by the persisting slowdown in global activity
. By contrast, there 
has been, so
 far,
 little sign of spill
-overs into 
the 
services
 sector (including firms 
providing real estate
-related services), which 
account
s for 
the 
large
st share of the 
growth in lending to
 NFCs.
 Judging from the results of the euro area bank lending 
survey (BLS), the slowdown in loan growth to firms appears mainly demand
-driven, 
e.g. resulting from lower financing needs for fixed investment. The leading indicator 
properties of the BLS also point t
o some further moderation in loan growth to firms in 
the first half of 2020. Credit standards, so far, have remained broadly unchanged, 
amid 
a mild negative reappraisal of the credit risk of firms, especially for
 small and 
medium
-sized enterprises
, which t
end to be particularly sensitive to the economic 
cycle.

 growth rate of consumer credit remained robust at the euro area level, standing at 6% 
in January, unchanged from December. It has moderated somewhat from levels above 
7% in early 2018. In contrast to the robust growth of mortgage loans and consumer 
credit
, the annual growth of other lending to households remained subdued at 
-1.0% in 
January, after 
-1.2% in December. The weakness in this loan type 
can be largely 
attributed to lending to 
small firms (
sole proprietors and unincorporated partnerships
), which a
re recorded in the household sector. These entities
 may have been particularly 
affected by the slowdown in economic activity
 and may also rely on non

 of euro area banks 
remained

stable in 
January.
 While loan
-to-deposit margins on new 
business 
have been compressed 
since 2014, given the stronger decline in lending rates than in deposit rates, the 
profitability implications of this compression have been counteracted 
by increasing 
lending volum
es. The overall effect on net interest income (as the product 
of lending 
margins and volumes) has been slightly positive
 over this period
. Since the ECB™s 
September 2019 deposit facility rate cut, the share of deposits, held by firms, that is 
remunerated a

loan

made further progress in improving 
their balance sheets,

average of new business volumes. The cross

 euro area countries. 
The latest observation is for 
January 2020
. The annual flow of total external financing to euro area NFCs 
has stabilised at 
solid levels in the fourth
 quarter of 201
9 (see
 panel (a) of
 Chart 2
4). Debt 
financing 
flows to NFCs have moderated since the fourth quarter of 2018 alongside 
the slowdown in economic activity. However, the downtrend in external financing flows 
has been halted in the final quarter of 2019. In 2019, the
 net issuance of bonds 
reached similar l
evels 
overall
 as in 2016
-17, while exceeding by a significant margin 
the 2018 level
. At the same time, bank borrowing by firms slowed down towards the 
end of 2019, 
owing to 
firms™ decreased financing needs, related to 
the lagged effects 
of the moderation i
n economic activity since mid
-2018, and 
despite favourable relative 
costs of debt financing
. Loans from non
-banks (non
-MFIs
) became less negative in 
the third quarter of 
2019 before turning 
slightly
 positive in 
the fourth quarter
, pointing to 
a modest 
stre
ngthening of 
corporate 
bond issuance via NFC financing conduits. 
Recent 
data suggest that the net issuance of debt securities
 was strong
 in January 
and February 2020. The n
et issuance of listed shares became more negative in 
annual terms
 in the fourth quar
ter of 2019
, reflecting
 continued weakness in issuance 
activity, a shift of listed shares to 
unquoted
 equity
 in 
the second quarter
 of 2019, 
and a 
sizeable 
base effect. In addition, the persistently higher cost of quoted equity, 
compared with firms™ cost of
 debt financing, dampens the use of quoted shares as a 
financing instrument.

  39 In 
January 2020
 the cost of financing for NFCs stood close to 
the level it was at 
in September 2019
 but is estimated to have increased significantly since then
 (see panel (b) of C
hart 24)
. In 
January 2020
 the overall nominal cost of external 
financing for NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance in the market a
nd equity 
finance, stood at 4.7
%. 
As such,
 the cost of financing in 
January 2020 was only 14
 basis points higher than in April
 2019, when the series was at its historical low. 
However, since then, and until 
the end of 
the reference period (11 March 2020), 
the 
overall cost of financing is estimated to have 
sharply 
increased 
to 5.1%.
 This reflects 
an increase 
in both 
the cost of equity
 and the cost of market
-based debt by 85
 and 10 
basis points
, respectively.
 The developments in both cost indicators can be ascribed to 
the rapid 
and sharp 
deterioration in risk sentiment due to the 
spread of the 
Coron
avirus that led to
 higher equity risk premia and wider corporate bond spreads 
(see Section 2).

 Fiscal developments
  41 6 Fiscal developments
 The euro area general government budget balance is projected to 
decline in
 2020 and 
2021 and to
 stabilise 
in 2022, according to the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections. The decline can be primarily attributed to lower primary surpluses. 
These 
developments are also reflected in the fiscal stance, which, according to the 
projections, is exp
ected to be expansionary in both 2020 and 2021 and broadly neutral 
in 2022. 
Despite
 the relatively expansionary fiscal stance, the euro area government 
debt-to-GDP ratio 
in the projections 
is expected to remain on a 
gradual 
downward path 
owing to a favoura
ble interest rate
-growth differential and a somewhat positive primary 
balance for the 
entire 
period. 
Developments related to the spread of the coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) after the projections were finalised do, however, point to a further 
expansion  of the fis
cal stance. In this respect, the 
Eurogroup™s commitment to joint 
and coordinated policy action should be strongly supported.
 In the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, t
he euro area general 
government budget 
balance
 is projected to 
decline 
in 2020 and 20
21 and to 
stabilise in 2022
.9 Based on the 
March
 2020 ECB
 staff macroeconomic projections, 
the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is expected 
to increase 
from 
an 
estimated 0.7
% of GDP in 201
9 to 
1.1
% in 
2020 and then to 1.5% in both 2021 and 
2022 (see Chart 25). 
The decline in the budget balance 
in 2020 and 20
21 stems 
mainly
 from 
a lower cyclically adjusted primary balance.
 This is partly compensated 
for 
by lower interest expenditure, while the cyclical com
ponent 
decreases marginally over 
the projection horizon

 Fiscal developments
  42 According to the March 2020 ECB staff projections, t
he 
euro area fiscal outlook 
for
 the period 
2020-22 shows a noticeably more supportive fiscal policy than in
 the 
December
 2019 Eurosystem
 staff projections
. The euro area general 
government 
budget balance as a share of GDP has been revised down by 0.2 
percentage points in 2020 and by 0.4 percentage points in both 2021 and 2022. These 
revisions are the result of a lower primary balance and a weaker than expected 
cyclical component, while the i
nterest expenditure component remains unchanged.
 The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to 
be expansionary 
in 2020 and 20
21 and broadly neutral in 2022
.10 The fiscal stance is estimated 
to have 
been mildly expansionary in 2019 and is expe
cted to loosen further in 2020 and 2021, 
providing 
support to economic activity
. This is mostly on account of 
higher spending, in 
particular for transfers, in Germany, Spain and Italy, as well as cuts to both direct taxes 
and social security contributions 
in France and the Netherlands
. In 2022 the fiscal 
stance is projected to be broadly neutral.
 The euro area aggregate public debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected 
to remain on a 
gradual downward path in the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections
. According
 to the 
projections
, the aggregate general government 
debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area is expected to decline from 8
4.5% of GDP in 201
9 to 
82.6%
 of GDP in 202
2. This 
reduction is supported by a favourable interest 
rate
-growth differential
11 while the accu
mulated contribution from the 
primary balance 
is close to zero over the forecast horizon
 (see Chart 2
6). Compared with the 
December
 2019 projections, the debt ratio is projected
 to decline
 more slowly, 
owing to 
lower projected primary surpluses and a less
 favourable cyclical component
. The 
faster spread of the coronavirus since the March 2020 projections were finalised 
suggests that the path of the public debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to be worse than 
that foreseen in the projections.
                                         
                           
 10  The fiscal stanc
e reflects the direction and size of the stimulus from fiscal policies to the economy, 
beyond the automatic reaction of public finances to the business cycle. It is measured here as the change 
in the cyclically adjusted primary balance ratio net of governm
ent support to the financial sector. For more 
details on the concept of the euro area fiscal stance, see the article entitled ﬁ

 Using information in newspaper articles as an indicator of real economic activity

 1 Using 
information 
in newspaper articles 
as an
 indicator of 
real 
economic 
activity
 Prepared by Massimo Ferrari and Helena Le Mezo
 Text analysis methods have been used extensively in the economic literature to 
measure macroeconomic risk and uncertainty
.12 However, there is limited 
evidence 
regarding
 the amount of information 
on real 
economic 
activity that can be 
extracted from such indices. This box presents an indicator for real 
economic 
activity 
in the United States 
based on 
the 
textual analysis of newspaper articles.
 The indicator 
is constructed u
sing data from the Factiva database
, which collects all articles 
published by major newspapers for a large set of countries. 
Newspaper articles
 published in the United States are
 extracted from the database 
and used to construct 
a text
-based activity indic
ator.
13 For each day since January 1970, the indicator 
measures the number of articles
 that 
discuss a slowdown (or recession) 
in the US 
economy relative to the total number of articles published in the United States. 
Intuitively, t
he constructed index shoul
d co
-move with the business cycle as 
newspapers devote more space to the 
subject 
of an economic slowdown. Moreover, 
the indicator should react faster to developments in
 the
 economic cycle that take time 
to become visible in aggregate macro variables
 and
 are often published with a lag. 
Finally, this index 
can be
 updat
ed easily at 
a high frequency (
on a daily basis
) and 
can 
be applied
 to a large number of advanced and emerging market economies.
 The constructed index can be used as a real
-time tracker of US re
al economic 
activity.
 Chart 
A shows that the indicator correlates well with periods of economic 
slowdown in the U
nited 
States
 when 
these are 
measured 
in terms of
 declines in 
industrial production or the recession dates established by the National Bureau of
 Economic Research (NBER). Th
is correlation suggests that the text
-based index can 
be used as a real
-time indicator to trac
k economic developments at 
a high frequency
, as it contains relevant information on the business cycle
.

  Sources: Factiva, Haver Analytics and authors™ calculations.
 Notes: The 
text

indicator is constructed

 daily
. The data are then 
aggregated at 
a monthly frequency.
 The latest observation is for January 2020.
 The in
dex also 
has
 predictive content for future economic activity.
 This assumption can be formally tested by adding the text
-based indicator to a standard 
recession probability model.
14 The following equation is estimated:
 (
)= +



+
+ (1)
 where the probability of a recession at the future horizon (
+) is forecast by the 
slope of the yield curve at the present 
horizon 
(the difference between short
-term and 
long
-term yields), 
which is 
a standard predictor of recession, and the text
-based 
indicator.
15 The index 
provides additional
 information 
on 
the slope of the US yield 
curve. The goodness of fit of recession probability 
models is summari
sed by the 
so-called receiver operator curve (ROC), which can be seen as a measure of the 
accuracy of the predictions 
made using
 the model.
16 The 
ROC 
statistic is reported in 
Chart 
B and shows that the specification 
applying
 the newspaper 
article
-based 
index 
is superior to the simple yield curve at short horizons. The inclusion of newspaper 
article 
data 
in the estimation significantly improves the performance of the model. This 
assessment is robust to a definition of recession
 other than tha
t used by
 the NBER 
(whereby 
a recession 
is defined as
 eight
 consecutive months of contraction in 
industrial production) and to exclusion of the 
global financial crisis period.

 The role of multinational taxation in the first reversal of foreign direct inves

  47 2 The role of multinational taxation i
n the first reversal of
 foreign direct investment
 flows in the euro area
 Prepared by Virginia Di Nino and Andrejs Semjonovs
 This box 
explains how the taxation of multinational enterprises following the 
recent corporate tax reform in the United States has a
ffected
 foreign direct 
investment (
FDI
) flows 
to and from
 the euro area.
17 In the euro area, like other 
advanced economies, the investments of resident companies abroad normally 
outpace the investments of foreign companies 
in the euro area. In the course of
 2018, 
however,
 net FDI 
outflows
 (which can also be described as the euro area™s net FDI 
assets 
Œ generally 
the 
investments of domestic companies in foreign affiliates) 
became
 inflows and net FDI 
inflows
 (or net liabilities, i.e. the
 net investments of foreign 
companies in the euro area) 
became
 outflows. These capital movements were to a 
significant extent related to certain measures of the US corporate tax reform that 
entered into force at the beginning of 2018.
18 The reversal of euro
 area FDI flows was due entirely to
 flows from and to (i) the 
United States and (ii) offshore centres (
see Chart A).
 US multinationals started 
disinvesting from the euro area
 (creating
 net FDI 
outflows in bilateral terms
) in 2017, 
i.e.
 ahead of the corpora
te tax reform, but aggregate 
euro area 
FDI flows recorded a 
reversal through the second half of 2018 as offshore centres
 also began to divest from 
the euro area

took place
 through

s (see Chart B).
 In other euro area 
economies, flows remained muted and no 
significant
 geographical recomposition of 
FDI transactions could be identified. Also, the double
-edged reversal (
assets
 and 
liabilities) reflects the high degree of co
-movement between asset and liabilit
y flows in 
countries subject to 
the
 round

 of multinational 
enterprises
.19 In Ireland
, however,
 the retrenchment of gross 
FDI 
inflows and outflows 
primarily concerned transactions with other euro area financial centres (and not the 
United 
States
) and materialised earlier, starting from
 the fourth quarter of 2017.
20 Given the complex structure of the global FDI network, a possible narrative 
consistent 
with this evidence is that some repatriation of profits from Ireland might have occurred 
via other 
euro area
 financial centres.

 Notes: 
Blue and red areas reflect net inward in
vestments in operating units which are special purpose entities. Yellow and green areas 
reflect net inward FDI in all other entities resident in the euro area which are affiliates of foreign companies
. Financial centres
 are:
 Belgium, Luxembourg and the Net
herlands. 
The r
est of 
the euro area
 includes all 
other
 member 
countries
 except 
Spain, 
Cyprus, 
Latvia 
and Malta
, which are excluded owing to a lack of data. The latest observations are for the third quarter of 2019.
 The decomposition of gross FDI flows by type of instrument 
shows
 that the 
reversal involved mainly equity but excluded the reinvested earnings 
component (see Chart C).
 In this respect, the reversal episode 
underlines the fact
 that FDI investment 
decisions 
primarily
 reflect tax considerations. 
It did not trigger a 
recomposition or relocation of FDI equity and debt 
to other euro area economies. 
Moreover
, reinvested earnings were basically 
unaffected,
 as the past profits
 repatriated at the 
one
-off preferential
 tax rate
 granted by the US corporate were
 not 
recorded as income distribution (ﬁsuper
ﬂ Œ or large, exceptional 
Œ dividends are 
recorded in the 
balance of payments
 under
 FDI equity transactions). As a result of this
, and amid stable net FDI in Ireland and
 the 
redomiciliation 
to Ireland 
of some large US 
multinational enterprises
, corporate tax revenues continued to expand in Ireland in 
2018.21                                         
                           
 21  In the past
, US corporate tax rate 
cuts 
seem to have 
increased
 employment and growth 
in Ireland 
via 
investment in externally financed industries
. This time
, however
, there might be a risk of capital outflows
, as result of changes in the activities of multinational enterprises in the country. See Clancy, D., ﬁUS

ve section (when positive) of the vertical axis. The 
latest observations are for the third quarter
 of 2019.
 While some provisions in the US tax reform were expected to have transitory 
effects on FDI transactions, the reform also contain
ed measures against 
erosion 
of the tax base, 
which can affect gross and net FDI flows in the long 
run.
 The reform 
invo
lved
 a one
-time lower
 tax on unrepatriated 
past 
profits
; however
, the 
full
 tax exemption 
now in place for foreign earnings in the form of dividends 
generally 
applies
 equally
 whether
 they
 are 
repatriated 
or held abroad. This weakens 
the incentive for US multinationals to reinvest 
earnings 
abroad. Besides, the reform 
also contains measures against erosion
 of the tax base
, which can affect gross and 
net FDI flows in the long run. It reduces incentives for US c
orporations to move their 
intangible assets offshore by allowing 
a tax deduction of 
up to 37.5%
 for
 foreign
-derived intangible income. 
The reversal of gross euro area FDI flows might 
thus be
 a transition to 
a new foreign investment equilibrium. 
While a
ny a
ssessment is 
early
, disinvestments continued in 2019 and
, in euro area financial centres,
 affected 
not only equity liabilities but also 
the debt component 
of FDI
 (see Chart C). The 
monthly estimates for the last quarter of 2019 suggest that 
the 
reversal 
might have 
halted
, and a normalisation of conditions maybe under way,
 but 
flows have remained 
fairly 
subdued in historical terms.

 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 30 October 2019 to 28

  51 3 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the 
period from 30 October 2019 to 28 January 2020
 Prepared by Pamina K
arl and Marco Weißler
 This box describes the monetary policy operations of the ECB during the 
seventh and eighth reserve maintenance periods of 2019, which ran from 30 
October to 17 December 2019 and from 18 December 2019 to 28 January 2020, 
respectively.
 The review period encompasses the start of the two
-tier system for 
remunerating excess liquidity holdings. Starting from the seventh reserve 
maintenance period, which began on 30 October 2019, this system exempts part of a 
credit institution™s excess liqui
dity holdings (i.e. reserve holdings in excess of minimum 
reserve requirements) from negative remuneration at the rate applicable to the deposit 
facility.
22 Instead, these excess liquidity holdings are currently remunerated at an 
annual rate of 0%. Other re
cent changes include the net repayments of liquidity 
provided through targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) as well as the 
resumption of asset purchases.
 Liquidity needs
 The average daily liquidity needs of the banking system, defined as the
 sum of 
net autonomous factors and reserve requirements, stood at •1,505.7 billion in 
the period under review.
 This was •53.7 billion lower than in the previous review 
period (i.e. the fifth and sixth reserve maintenance periods of 2019; see Table A). Net 
autonomous factors decreased by •55.4 billion, while minimum reserve requirements 
increased by •1.7 billion to •134.3 billion.
 The decrease in net autonomous factors was driven primarily by an increase on 
the asset side of the Eurosystem balance sheet (net
 foreign assets and net 
assets denominated in euro).
 Autonomous factors on the asset side increased by 
•55.1 billion to •1,009.1 billion, reflecting both a •33.2 billion increase in net foreign 
assets, which was similar to the growth in the previous review
 period, and a •21.9 
billion increase in net assets denominated in euro to •238.0 billion. Autonomous 
factors on the liability side remained almost unchanged on aggregate (down •0.4 
billion). While other autonomous factors and banknotes in circulation rose
 by •42.3 
billion and •20.0 billion, respectively, these increases were fully offset by lower 
government deposits, which averaged •219.8 billion in the period under review after 
reaching a historical high of •298.6 billion in the sixth reserve maintenance 
period. 
Overall, net autonomous factors 
Œ defined as liquidity
-absorbing autonomous factors 
on the liability side less liquidity
-providing autonomous factors on the asset side 
Œ fell 
to •1,371.4 billion.
                                         
                           
 22  Eligible reserve holdings of financial institutions are computed on the basis of average 
end-of-calendar
-day balances held in the institution
™s current accou
nt over the maintenance period. 
The 
exemption from 
negative interest rates 
applies to excess liquidity holdings in the current account up to a 
certain multiple of the institution™s 
minimum reserve requirement.
 The Governing Council set the initial 
multipli
er at six.

 The average amount of liquidity provided through open market operations 
Œ including both tender operations and moneta
ry policy portfolios 
Œ decreased 
by •22.4 billion to •3,272.2 billion (see Chart A).
 As during the previous two 
maintenance periods, this decrease was driven primarily by lower demand in tender 
operations. In contrast, and unlike in previous review periods
 in 2019, liquidity 
provided through monetary policy portfolios increased again as a result of the 
resumption of net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) in 
November 2019.

 Evolution of liquidity provided through open market operations
 and excess liquidity
 (EUR billions)
  Source: ECB.
 Note: The latest observation is for 28 January 2020.
 The average amount of liquidity provided through tender operations declined 
during the review period, as it did during the previous review period.
 The 
decrease of •39.9 billion to •644.0 billion was mainly due to lower liquidity provided 
through TLTROs. Financial institutions in the euro area voluntarily repaid •87.3 billion 
of TLTRO II funding on average during the two maintenance periods. This exceeded
 the uptake of new TLTRO III funding, which increased by •47.2 billion to •48.5 billion 
on average over the review period. In addition, liquidity provision via main refinancing 
operations (MROs) decreased slightly, from •2.5 billion to •2.3 billion. The ob
served 
average decrease would have been even larger without the year
-end MRO operation, 
in which •7.9 billion was allotted. The outstanding amount of three
-month longer
-term 
refinancing operations (LTROs) increased slightly, by •0.5 billion.
 Liquidity prov
ided through the Eurosystem™s monetary policy portfolios 
increased by •17.5 billion to •2,628.2 billion, owing to the resumption of net 
asset purchases.
 Average holdings increased by •12.3 billion to •2,099.9 billion in 
the public sector purchase programme
 (PSPP) and by •6.2 billion to •183.5 billion in 
the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). In addition, holdings under the 
third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and the asset
-backed securities 
purchase programme (ABSPP) increased by •2.8 bill
ion and •2.1 billion, 
respectively.
23 Redemptions of bonds held under the Securities Markets Programme 
(SMP) totalled •4.9 billion in the review period.
 Excess liquidity
 As aggregate liquidity needs decreased, average excess liquidity increased 
compared wit
h the previous review period, by •31.3 billion to •1,766.5 billion 
                                        
                           
 23  Even with full reinvestment, limited temporary deviations in the overall size and composition of the APP 
may occur for operational reasons.

  56 (see Chart A).
 Despite lower provision of liquidity through tender operations, the 
decrease in net autonomous factors and the resumption of net asset purchases 
increased excess liquidity in
 the euro area.
 In addition, the composition of excess liquidity was affected by the start of the 
two
-tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings in the euro area as 
of the seventh maintenance period.
 This is due to the fact that only balances h
eld in 
financial institutions™ current accounts up to their maximum allowance are exempt from 
negative remuneration at the rate applicable to the deposit facility. This led to a 
rebooking of funds held by financial institutions from the deposit facility, w
hich 
decreased by •253.6 billion, to their current accounts, which increased by •284.9

 The implications of fiscal measures to address climate change
  57 4 The implications of fiscal measures to address climate
 change
 Prepared by 
Steffen Osterloh
 This box assesses the impact of fiscal measures to 
reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions
 on growth and inflation over the 
March 2020 ECB staff 
projection 
horizon.
 Current EU
-wide 
emission reduction 
targets and policy objectives for the 
period 20
21-30 are based on the 2030 climate and energy framework, which was 
adopted
 by the European Council in 2014. The framework 
sets
 binding targets for 
cutting greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels, namely a reduction in 
emissions 
of 20% 
by 2020 and at
 least 40% by 2030. Policies to reduce carbon 
emissions in the European Union comprise: (a) the EU Emissions Trading System 
(ETS), which covers around 45% of 
the 
EU™s greenhouse gas emissions and
 limits 
emissions from
, in particular, sectors with heavy ene
rgy use
 within the European 
Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway
, such as power stations, 
energy
-intensive industries and 
flights
 between
 airports located in the European 
Economic Area (EEA)
; and (b) national measures in sectors that are not covere
d by 
the ETS, such as transport, heating and agriculture.
 The EU ETS provides certainty about annual emission reduction in the sectors 
covered but leaves uncertainty concerning the development of allowance 
prices.
 The EU ETS 
works 
on the ﬁ
cap
 and
 trade
ﬂ principle
, set
ting
 a cap on the total 
amount of
 certain
 greenhouse gases that can be emitted by 
installations
 covered by 
the system and allow
ing
 firms to trade their emission allowances. The cap is reduced 
over time so that total emissions fall. The share of
 auctioned allowances, 
i.e. 
allowances that are not given away for free to companies, has been increased over 
time, rising to 57% in the trading period 2013
-20. The price which companies have to 
pay for the auctioned share of the allowances has an effect s
imilar to a tax on the 
carbon content of a company™s inputs, as it immediately increases their production 
costs. The empirical literature shows that 
cost increases due to previous ETS 
allowance price rises were, 
to a large extent
, passed 
through
 to consume
r prices.
24 The development of allowance prices in the EU ETS over the past two years has 
possibly generated some limited inflationary pressures, but markets expect
, at 
most
, further moderate increases over the projection horizon.
 Having
 been 
relatively sta
ble at low levels of, on average, around •6 per tonne of CO2 between 
2012 and 2017, the ETS price rose significantly in 2018 and 2019, ending 2019 at 
around •25 per tonne. This increase also translated into a surge in public revenues 
from the auctioned all
owances and 
additional costs for
 companies. This 
implies 
a positive impact on euro area inflation in 2018 and 2019 and a negative but very small 
impact on GDP growth. However, despite the ongoing rationing of emission 
allowances, ETS futures currently do n
ot point to a further surge in prices, which 
suggests that no major impact on consumer prices is expected 
in the coming years
. Nevertheless, volatile allowance prices continue to represent a risk factor 
for
 the HICP.

 The 
implications of fiscal measures to address climate change
  58 The reduction in emissions in the 
remaining
 (non
-ETS)
 sectors is enshrined in 
the Effort Sharing 
Regulation.
 This legislation establishes binding annual 
greenhouse gas emission targets for EU Member States for the periods 2013
-20 and 
2021-30. Overall, compared with 2005 levels, the nationa
l targets aim to collectively 
deliver a reduction of around 10% by 2020 and 30% by 2030. In contrast to ETS 
sectors, Member States are responsible for design
ing
 policies to achieve national 
targ
ets for non
-ETS sectors.
 A national carbon pricing system for 
sectors not covered by the EU ETS, which 
is expected to have positive effects on inflation, 
was recently agreed in 
Germany.
 As part of the ﬁclimate packageﬂ agreed in December 2019, a national 
carbon pricing system for the transport and 
building heating
 sector
s will be introduced 
in 2021. As the carbon pricing system will start with a fixed price that will gradually 
increase until 2025, it 
initially 
resembles a carbon tax. The December 2019 projections 
reflected the initial coalition agreement of a starting
 price of •10 per tonne of CO2 for 
2021. A positive effect on HICP between 2021 and 2022 was 
forecast
, while the effect 
on GDP was expected to be small.
25 The impact on prices and GDP is
 expected to be
 muted as a large share of the revenue from the sale of 
allowances will be used to 
compensate industry and consumers
, particularly 
via 
lower electricity prices
 resulting 
from a reduction in 
the levy 
imposed by 
the 
German 
Renewable Energy Act 
(Erneuerbare
-Energien
-Gesetz
 Œ EEG) in line with increasing CO2 prices
. Moreover, 
climate
-related spending will be increased. The March 2020 projection incorporates 
the revised package, which 
envisages
 a much higher price of •25 per tonne 
of 
CO2 in 
2021, rising to •55 per tonne by 2025. However, the macroeconomic implication
s of 
this revision are 
expected
 to be small since the effects of the higher CO2 price will be 
lessened
, reflecting the announcement that the additional revenue will be fully used to 
further lower electricity p
rices by reducing the EEG levy.
 Few increases i
n carbon taxes are expected 
in the next years
. Together with 
carbon cap
 and
 trade schemes, carbon taxes, which are levied on the carbon content 
of fuels, are regarded as the most cost
-effective instrument to reduce carbon 
emissions. An automatic gradual in
crease in carbon prices to reach national emission 
reduction targets would allow households and firms to adapt, but none of the eight 
euro area countries with a carbon tax 
currently 
has such an automatic mechanism in 
place. Ireland has passed legislation f
or an increase in carbon taxes for 2020 with very 
minor fiscal implications for the euro area as a whole and the government has stated 
its intention to introduce linear increases in the tax until 2030. In Portugal, a 
mechanism links the carbon tax 
rate 
to 
the price of EU ETS allowances in the 
preceding year, which has recently led to some increases. The remaining countries 
currently do not foresee an increase in their carbon tax rates.
 Several countries are planning increases in environmental taxes over the
 projection horizon, but the
ir overall size is limited
 at the euro area level
. More
 than half of euro area countries plan to increase environmental taxes other than 
carbon taxes over the next two years. Th
ese increases mostly relate to excise taxes 
on ener
gy and fuels, but also 
concern
 taxes on vehicles and airline tickets.

  59 biggest increase in such taxes is foreseen in the Netherlands, although the 
macroeconomic effects will be largely offset by compensatory cuts to energy taxes.
 In 
the other countries
, these measures are typically small (in almost 
every
 case the 
annual increase is below 0.1% of GDP) and for the euro area as a whole their size is 
marginal. Moreover, in some cases, indirect tax measures with an expansionary effect 
will be implemented, su
ch as tax cuts to incentivise the use of public transport,

no other

 effects are expected 
in 
other countries that already 
have carbon taxes in place. Several Member States are planning increases in 
environmental taxes but the implic
ations for growth and prices over the projection 
horizon are 
projected 
to be small for the euro area as a whole.
 However, in the 
medium term the impact of climate measures on prices could increase owing to a 
possible 
further tightening of emission reductio

as part of the European 
Green Deal
 which was announced by the European Commission in December 2019.

. 1 Introduction
 The rise of large, profitable
, global firms and the mobility of intangible assets
26 have increased the relevance of 
firms™
 profit
-shifting activities, posing 
challenges
 to the current framework of international statistics.
 The balance 
sheets of large 
multinational 
enterprises (MNEs)
27 have become 
very sizeable
. The 
assets of the largest 
listed 
companies
 in 
major advanced economies
, amounting to a 
value of 
several hundred billions of US dollars, 
are roughly equal
 to the gross domestic 
product of 
many small open econom
ies
. In order to 
reduce
 their tax burden, MNEs 
carry out 
a range of activ
ities
: these
 includ
e shifting profits
 to low
-tax jurisdictions
 by 
manipulating
 transfer pric
ing
28 and 
shifting
 intra
-company 
positions 
Œ often this 
involves 
complex financial structures and the creation of 
SPEs in low
-tax,
 or no
-tax
, jurisdictions. 
These ac
tivities are extremely difficult to track. 
The novel
ty of some 
                                        
                           
 26  Intangible assets include non
-physical items such as goodwill items, brand recognition products and 
intellectual property products (IPPs). IPPs, such as licens
es and patents, result from
 varying 
combinations of 
research
, development, investigation 
and inno
vation
 that
 lead to knowledge
; using this 
knowledge
 is restricted by law
s or other means of protection
 (see 
European system of accounts 
- ESA 
2010
). Research and development
 leading to assets of intellectual property
 are recorded as gross fixed 
capital formation
. 27  Multinational enterprises
 are enterprises producing goods or delivering services in more than one 
country. MNE headquarters 
are 
rarely
 located
 in 
more than one country
 (the home country
). However 
they operate
 in 
a number of 
other countries
 (the host countrie
s). 28  Transfer pricing 
refers to the rules and methods for pricing transactions within and between enterprises 
under common ownership or control.

29. International tax avoidance by MNEs is not a novel phenomenon but its rapid 
growth 
increasingly attracts
 the attention of academics and policy
 makers.
30 Global firms r
espond to tax incentives when 
recording
 worldwide income among 
affiliates. A recent survey of this literature finds that a decrease by one percentage 
point in the statutory corporate tax rate translates into a 1%
 expansion of before
-tax 
income 
for global 
firms
.31 Importantly, this study 
shows
 that the estimated impact 
appears to be increasing over time. Transfer pricing and licensing seem to be the main 
channels of tax 
avoidance 
Œ these appear to be
 more important than financial 
planning.
32 International tax
ation may also alter the geography of foreign direct 
investment (FDI)
: a higher statutory tax rate in 
a target

 country 
discourages the acquisition of firms in that country, while lower tax burdens may attract

s on the 
implications of these tax
-avoidance activities for the measurement of the external 
wealth of nations and the diminished ability of government

34 A number of policy initiatives at the international level have been launched to 
counteract the 
intensification
 of tax avoidance.
 The Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (
OECD
) estimates that
 240 
billion US dollars in
 tax 
revenues are
 lost
 globally 
every year 
as a result of
 tax avoidance by 
MNEs
. As a 
result,
 the OECD

the
 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)

 that identifies 
15 actions

 international 
tax avoidance

  Tax avoidance and tra
nsparency: policy initiatives at the international
 and EU level
 Prepared by 
Maurizio Michael Habib and Martin Schmitz
 At the international level, 
the OECD, with the support of the G20, championed work on limiting tax 
avoidance. 
The 
OECD/G20 
BEPS
 Project, 
finalised in 2015, proposes measures to reduce tax 
avoidance; it also
 includes new requirement
s for MNE financial reporting, 
in particular for 
country
-by-country reporting by 2025. 
Many of the recommendations of the OECD/G20 BEPS 
Project 
have been 
transpos
ed at the EU level 
via 
the European Commission
™s broad 
Anti
-Tax Avoidance 
Package.
37 This package 
also includes the revision of the Administrative
 Cooperation Directive, 
proposing
 country
-by-country reporting between Member States' tax authorities on key ta
x-related 
information 
concerning
 multinationals operating in the EU.
 Statistical compilers need to closely cooperate internationally to 
ensure that 
MNE activities
 are 
recorded consistently from country to country. This means that they have to share 
confide
ntial data on 
MNEs and their subsidiaries across borders. 
The GNI pilot project
, launched by the European 
Statistical System Committee in 2018, 
takes steps in
 this direction
; it aims 
to 
jointly 
assess
 the 
consistency of statistical recording 
among
 national statistical authorities
, using
 a sample of 25 MNEs 
in Europe
. Moreover, some national statistical 
authorities
 have set
 up 
large 
case 
units to monitor the activities of 
MNEs 
nationally.
 However, 
no 
formal coordination exists yet at the internation
al level. Further 
development of legal entity identifiers and business registers 
would also be instrumental in 
improv
ing
 national accounts and 
b.o.p.
 statistics.
38  The traces of 
MNE operations 
are
 particularly 
apparent
 in the external 
statistics
 of 
financi
al centres
. Since the euro area hosts 
some
 significant financial centres, this 
article 
discusses 
the dynamic
s of 
their 
external accounts. 
We adopt a 
standard
 operational definition of financial centres
 on the basis of
 the size of the
ir stock of 
foreign lia
bilities relative to GDP. 
These 
are 
therefore 
economies where financial 
activities tend to dominate domestic economic activity
. In particular, financial centres 
are defined as the 
ten
 advanced economies 
with the largest ratio
s of foreign liabilities 
to GDP 
in a large sample of more than 60 countries. These
 ten financial centres
 include six euro area economies (Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and 
the Netherlands) and four non
-euro area economies (Hong Kong SAR, Singa
pore,

 the role of

. It is worth considering whether this has an 
impact on 
current account imbalances

s. Financial centres tend to record large current account surpluses
: eight out of the ten 
financial 
centres, as defined in this article, 
had a current 
account 
surplus
 over the past 
two decades
 on average
. However, each one has its own business model, which is 
reflected in the diverse composition of their current accounts. Chart 2 shows the 
breakdown of the current accounts of these economies into their main subcomponents 
since 2010, 
when the stock of FDI liabilities started to grow rapidly. For the first group 
of economies 
Œ Singapore, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Ireland 
Œ the current 
account surplus is mainly the outcome of a large surplus in the balance of goods. As 
explained i
n Section 2 and Section 3, the activities of MNEs (such as merchanting and 
                                        
                           
 39  These economies (with the exception of the United Kingdom) are also the largest hubs in terms of the 
stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) to GDP. FDI is a component of the
 balance of payments (b.o.p.) 
and international investment position (i.i.p.) that is closely related to the activities of MNEs
. In this article, 
to identify financial centres and exclude
 oil producing countries that tend to report large gross foreign 
asset
 positions
, w
e focus on gross foreign liabilities 
instead of the sum of assets and liabilities, using IMF 
Balance of Payments Statistics. 
The activities of small off
-shore financial centres fall outside the scope of 
this article. This is because detailed
 b.o.p. statistics 
are not always available. Moreover, the huge size of 
the external 
balance sheet
 of offshore centres relative to their GDP would distort some of the results 
shown in the article.
 It should be noted that advanced economies classed
 as financ
ial centres
 are not 
necessarily considered to be tax havens for corporate taxation purposes. In general, these financial 
centres have relatively low corporate tax rates, but this is not necessarily always the case. For instance, 
the statutory corporate tax
 rates of Belgium, the Netherlands and Malta are above the average rate of all 
other economies in our sample.

 The correct measur
ement of external statistics
, such as those discussed in this 
article, is
 important for central banks.
 Large 
external 
imbalances 
may raise 
concerns about the sustainability of economic growth and about financial stability, 
which can affect monetary policy 
and macroprudential policies. For instance, central 
banks monitor external accounts to assess the equilibrium value of exchange rates, 
while noting potential misalignments 
Œ this is because abrupt and significant 
corrections in exchange rates may influence
 inflation developments. A distorted 
representation of aggregate current account imbalances could provide flawed signals 
to policy makers.
 This
 article is structured as follows.

 2.1
 The origins of measurement challenges
 The operations of large MNEs 
affect 
national accounts statistics and
, in 
particular
, external accounts
, thus creating
 challenges for statistical 
compilation and economic analysis.
40 This section reviews how typical
 MNE
 operations are 
captured
 in 
b.o.p.
 and 
i.i.p.
 statistics
; it also
 highlights
 some of the 
associated measurement 
challenges
. MNE t
ax planning strategies 
main
ly 
affect 
b.o.p. 
data 
in three ways
: (i) 
by 
shifting profits to affiliates in low
-tax jurisdictions, which can 
involve
 mov
ing IPPs or manipulation of 
transfer pric
es on intra
-firm trade
; (ii) by 
shifting intra
-firm debt obligations 
and capital linkages; 
(iii) by redomiciling 
headquarters and legal incorporation
s to 
financial centres
 with favourable tax 
arrangements. 
This section also shows why t
hese activities have different implications 
for the current account and 
i.i.p.
 of countries hosting MNE
s and their
 affiliates
. Measurement challenges 
are caused by
 friction between residence
-based 
national statistics
 methodologies
 and 
the 
global 
activities
 and ownership 
structures of large MNEs.
 B.o.p.
 and national accounts statistics
, and 
their 
associated 
data collec
tion
 processes,
 are based on the residency concept
, according 
to which each institutional unit
41 is resident of one economic territory
: the place where 
they have
 their 
centre of predominant economic interest
. However, 
MNEs
 tend to 
organise their production chains and corporate structures across the globe involving 
numerous legal entities, including SPEs (see Box 
2).42 Data on 
these entities 
are 
recorded in 
the national 
b.o.p.
 statistics 
for the economy of the country
 where
 they 
reside.
 Consequently 
these data are 
not consolidated across borders with the home 
country of the
ir parent MNE.

 42  The
 UNCTAD World Investment Report 2015
 shows that
 larger MNEs
 are associated with
 a greater 
complexity of their internal ownership structures. The top 100 MNEs in UNCTAD™s Transnationality Index 
have 
on average more than 500 affiliates across more than 50 countries, 
with 
seven hierarchical levels

20 holding companies

  66 Box 
2  Towards a recording
 of special
-purpose entities in cross
-border statistics
 Prepared by Martin Schmitz
 The use of SPEs by MNEs has 
increased rapidly in recent years.
44 According to 
a recent Task Force 
of the 
Balance of Payments Committee (BOPCOM)
 at the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF)
, an SPE 
is: (i) a formally registered
 or 
incorporated legal entity
 that is
 resident in an economy an
d recognised 
as an institutional unit 
with little or no
 employment 
(up to a maximum of five employees
), little or no
 physical presence, and 
little or no
 physical production
 activities
 in the host economy; (ii) directly or 
indirectly controlled by non
-resid
ents; (iii) established to obtain specific advantages provided by the 
host jurisdiction
; (iv) transact
ing
 almost entirely with non
-residents with large part
s of the financial 
balance of a cross
-border nature.
45 The IMF 
BOPCOM 
Task Force proposed this intern
ationally 
agreed definition of SPEs 
with the aim of
 collect
ing
 comparable cross
-country data that separately 
identify SPEs in cross
-border statistics
. This is because
 the size of SPE
-related cross
-border financial 
flows and positions often tends to be outsized relative to a country™s domestic economy, 
blurring
 the 
analysis of macroeconomic statistics in the affected countries
. There is a high presence of SPEs in a numb
er of euro area countries. This
 group of countries
 includes 
Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands
, which are all part of the financial centres 
group shown in Chart 1.
 In these economies SPEs have a significant impact on the 
i.i.p.
 and 
cros
s-border transactions, mainly affecting FDI but also portfolio and other investment. Moreover
, in 
some cases
, SPEs have non
-financial assets (such as IPPs) on their balance sheet.
 EU economies with SPE presence tend to a have a well
-developed legal, financ
ial and consulting 
services sector.
46 MNEs 
may 
set
 up SPEs to organise their internal financing arrangement, which 
requires the availability of highly specialised service providers such as lawyers, tax consultants and 
financial sector experts in the economi
es that are
 hosting SPEs. Tax
-avoidance
 strategies
, for 
instance,
 often involve the establishment of complex corporate structures involving 
SPEs across 
several
 EU countries.
 The IMF BOPCOM Task Force™s definition of SPEs 
would be helpful
 in ensuring the av
ailability 
of internationally consistent external sector statistics with a separate breakdown for SPEs.
 The IMF BOPCOM aims to publish data that separately identify SPEs in cross
-border statistics by 
the 
end of 
2021. 
Achieving this goal would require
 furth
er practical guidance on the application of the 
definition of SPEs in 
the light of
 the
ir heterogeneous nature and their 
cross
-border activities.
  Measurement 
challenges
 are exacerbated by digitalisation and the increasing 
importance of 
IPPs
, which are part
icularly relevant for 
financial centres
. Over 
time
 the
 corporate structures of MNEs have become increasingly dynamic 
as a result 
of the 
redomicil
ing
 of headquarter
s and the
 increased relevance of intangible assets 
(such as patents and copyrights), which ca
n be moved across borders with greater

  67 ease than physical assets, such as factories. 
The
se phenomena
 can have
 large 
effects in terms of magnitude and volatility of statistical indicators
, which
 become 
especially visible in those economies where MNE 
transactions and balance sheets are 
large relative to the size of the domestic economy.
 2.2
 MNEs and current account balances
 To trace the impact 
that 
MNE operations
 have
 on external account
s, various 
components of the 
b.o.p.
 need to be 
looked at separatel
y.47 According to 
the 
b.o.p. identity, it holds that
 ++
= (1)
 where 
CA stands for the current account balance, 
KA for the capital account balance 
(comprising mainly transfers of capital and non
-produced non
-financial assets), 
EO for 
errors an
d omissions (capturing any statistical discrepancy)
, and 
FA for the financial 
account balance.
48 MNE
 operations
 affect various items of a country™s current account balance, the 
key variable measuring trade, 
and 
income and transfer
 flows vis
-à-vis 
non
-reside
nts
. The current account consists of the trade balances in 
goods and 
services
 as well as cross
-border factor income (
primary income)
 and transfers 
(secondary income
), with the f
irst
 three being directly 
affected by the actions of MNEs:

 Cross
-border production arrangements and merchanting
 activities
 related to
 MNEs
 can affect the trade
-in-goods component of the current account.
 This 
might
 involve
 foreign 
subsidiaries
 of MNE
s (in what is known as 
offshoring) or an 
unrelated foreign company (
i.e. 
outsourcing). 
B.o.p.
 statistics are based on the 
concept of change in economic ownership. 
Which means
, in contrast to international 
trade statistics 
that
 measure al
l goods
 crossing a
 country™s border, 
trade in goods
 recorded
 in 
b.o.p. 
statistics also 
includes
 contract manufacturing
 and 
merchanting
. In 
contract manufacturing
, an MNE hires a foreign company to produce a good. During 
the production process, the ownershi
p of the inputs remains with the MNE and hence 
no trade flows are recorded in the 
b.o.p. (
with the exception of an import by the MNE of
 manufacturing services from the foreign 
company
 that is 
producing the good
). However, t
he b.o.p.
 does include 
the sale o
f the final product
s to third 
countries, which 
is consistent
 with the change in ownership principle. 
Merchanting
 is the process 
whereby
 a company purchas
es a good from an entity resident abroad
, and 
subsequently sell
s it to a buyer in a third country
 witho
ut the good crossing the border 
of the country where the merchant is based

to fi
nance, insure, store and transport the good) is recorded as net exports of merchanting in the goods

  68 entities belonging to the same group
, the
ir pricing has a decisive impact on the amount 
and location of profits booked
, which is 
in line with 
the well
-established concept of
 transfer
 pricing.
50 MNE
 business operations
 affect 
trade in services
, reflecting the rise of the 
knowledge economy and digitalisation
. As IPPs can
 often
 be easily moved across 
borders within an MNE group, possibly involving S
PEs, they 
affect 
exports and 
imports.
 51 IPPs are hard to value at market prices and
, therefore,
 MNEs may use 
them to avoid taxation. For example, 
one entity of an MNE 
might 
own the group™s IPP
 assets
, while other entities 
in the same 
group pay licen
ce fees
 and royalties for its use.
 The primary income balance
, which 
is dominated by
 investment income flows
, is another
 component of the current account affected by MNE 
operations.
52 Investment income
 reflects the 
receipts and 
payments generated by an economy™s 
external assets and liabilities (such as dividends and interest)
, and can be further 
decomposed into functional categories
 of 
the 
b.o.p.
 (FDI
, portfolio investment, other
 investment and reserve assets).
 MNE operations are particularly visible in FDI income
.53 Income on FDI 
comes
 from its equity and debt components. Equity income can be further decomposed into 
dividends (profits distributed to the direct investor) and reinvested earnings (profits 
retained in the foreign affiliate). Crucially, the direct invest
or™s decision
 to reinvest 
earnings (i.e. to keep them in a foreign subsidiary) is recorded twice
 in offsetting ways 
in the b.o.p. 
Œ once 
as income on
 FDI
, and once
 as a 
reinvestment of equal size in the 
financial account. In practice, MNEs 
can
 use complex 
corporate structures to optimise 
their tax burden
 Œ for example,
 by concentrating reinvested earnings in certain 
jurisdictions and by organising intra
group
 debt obligations. Apart from FDI, the 
cross
-border ownership of MNEs may also affect portfolio 
inves
tment in 
equity. In 
portfolio 
investment 
equity
, only dividend payments are recorded in the income 
account, while non
-distributed profits are not included.
54 The MNE operations 
described in this article
 mainly affect the composition of a 
country™s current a
ccount balance, while leaving 
the level of the
 current 
account balance 
unchanged.
 For instance, l
et™s first assume that a company 
resid
ing
 in 
ﬁcountry A
ﬂ manufactures a pharmaceutical product and 
exports
 it to 
                                        
                           
 50  In many countries tax authorities apply what is known as the arms
-length principle to transfer 
pricing 
(i.e. 
the rules 
for pricing intra
-group transactions)
. 
According to this principle, intra
-group transactions need to 
be priced in the same way as transactions with unrelated firms.
 51  Trade in IPPs is included in the other business services category of the 
b.o.p.
, while the royalties and 
fees for use of these assets are recorded as charges for the use of intellectual property.
 Non-produced 
intangible assets
 are recorded
 in the
 b.o.p.™s
 capital account.
 52  Primary income also includes 
compensation of employees
 and other primary income
. 53  An FDI relationship exists when a foreign 
direct 
investor holds equity that entitles 
it to 10% (or more) of 
the voting power in the direct investment enterprise. Once the FDI relationship is established between 
two entities, all financial transactions between them are 
recorded as
 FDI.
 54  The asymmetric treatment of reinvested earning in FDI 
and portfolio investment equity is seen, in some 
studies, as creating biases in the current account. See, for example, Thomas J. Jordan™s 
speech at the 
University of Basel from the 23 November 2017
, which notes an upward bias for the Swiss current 
account surplus as the FDI 
profits (distributed and retained) earned 
by Swiss MNEs are included in the 
Swiss current account. 
As these 
MNEs
 are to a large extent 
owned by non
-Swiss residents via portfolio 
equity investment
s only dividend payments ﬁleaveﬂ Switzerland via the income account
. While
 not 
recorded in the current account, the non
-distributed profits should increase the market value of the Swiss 
MNEs and h
ence increase the portfolio equity liabiliti
es in the i.i.p. of Switzerland.

the value of the current account balance of 
ﬁcountry Aﬂ
 is the same in 
either
 scenario, but 
the
 composition

 in the second 
scenario 
because
 an investment income surplus replaces a trade surplus
. In contrast, MNE redomiciliation strategies 
Œ i.e. 
relocating their
 headquarters 
to another country 
Œ may have a significant impact on headline current account 
balances.
55 Even if the redomiciliation of an MNE is not associated with additional 
economic activity in the economy of residency, the current accou
nt balance may be 
affected in several ways 
(e.g. due to attribution of net exports resulting from contract 
manufacturing or IPP
 related services trade)
. Primary income may be affected due to 
the differing treatment of reinvested earnings in FDI and portfol
io equity. The country 
hosting the 
redomiciled
 global firm will record an improvement in the 
net FDI position
 and deterioration in the 
net portfolio equity position
, to the extent that its shareholders 
are located outside the economy 
that hosts
 the new hea
dquarters, 
which is typically 
the case for a small
 FDI hub
. However, t
hese two offsetting positions
 produce two 
different income streams. Reinvested earnings from foreign subsidiaries are recorded 
as income receipts and boost the recorded current account
 balance
, whereas profits 
payments to foreign 
MNE 
shareholders
 are only recorded if they are distributed as 
divid
ends (in portfolio investment).

  70 Finally, it should be 
noted
 that MNE
 activities
 not only impact cross
-border 
statistics but also affect the broader national accounts.
 A case in point is Ireland
, where investment income flows
, related to 
redomiciled MNEs, the depreciation of 
IPPs
 and aircraft leasing
, had a large impact on Irish GDP and GNI.
57 As a result, Ireland™s 
Central Statistics Office publishes a number of modified economic indicators (such as

 that exclude these phenomena and thereby 
provide a more 
focused
 view of 
domestic economic developments.
 3 How do multinational enterprise
 activit
ies
 affect 
the euro area 
balance of payments
? MNE operations 
affect
 the external account
s of 
the 
euro area
, though their 
impact
 varies markedly across 
the 19 euro area countries
. The aggregate 
b.o.p.
 of the euro area masks the 
varied 
impact of MNE activities on 
the
 external statistics
 of 
each individual country
. Euro area
 countries can 
be classified
 into 
two gro
ups,
 which 
present marked 
differences in the
ir external accounts: six 
economies 
that are 
specialised
 in 
providing
 financial services
58 and 
another
 13 economies that are not.
 The 
size, composition and volatility of the 
current
 account and financial
 account b
alance
s of euro area 
financial centres are
 significantly affected
 by 
MNE 
transactions.
 Section 3.1
 presents stylised facts 
on the euro area 
b.o.p.
 related 
to the activity of specialised 
subsidiaries, such as SPEs 
in 
financial centres, whose
 location is 
primarily 
determined 
by tax
-related
, financial and regulatory considerations. 
Section 3.2 then focuses on the impact that SPEs have on FDI.
 3.1
 Euro area current account
 When comparing the composition and size of the current accounts of financial 
centres w
ith those of other economies in the euro area, five key features stand 
out.
 First, financial centres
 in the euro area share a similar current account 
composition
: they 
exhibit large trade surpluses 
that are 
partly counterbalanced 
by income deficits
. This i
s shown in Chart 
3 and corroborated by the empirical 
evidence in Box 3 based on a larger sample of the top ten global financial centres. 
The trade surpluses of financial centres often 
reflect exports with large value added
, such 
as those related to licence
s in the field of information and communications technology. 
The literature on global value chain
s (GVCs)
 has established that value added is 
mainly created in 
very 
upstream
 activities
 (e.g. research and development
, design
 and 
financial services
) or 
very 
downstream 
activities
 (e.g. 
merchanting, logistic
s, royalties 
from licen
ces, brand
ing and
 marketing)

 Box 
3  Financial centres
 and current account imbalances
 Prepared by 
Maurizio Michael Habib
 This box provides an empirical assessment of the size of current account imbalances in financial 
centres compared with other countrie
s. As noted throughout this article, MNE
 activities 
widen the 
gross external positions 
and
 the current accounts of financial centres, while also affecting their 
composition. Moreover, financial centres tend to report current account surpluses. 
To a large e
xtent, 
the
se observed patterns
 may be ascribed to the concentration of financial activities in a limited 
number of financial centres, which may not exclusively reflect 
MNE activities
, but also those of banks, 
other financial intermediaries and individual i
nvestors resident in financial centres
. It is, therefore, 
important to widen this analysis to the various subcomponents of financial centre current accounts, 
including the goods balance, the services balance and the investment income 
balance.
 Empirical evi
dence confirms that the current account surpluses of financial centres, after controlling 
for other potential determinants of current account balances, are particularly large from a global 
perspective.
 Current account balances and
 their
 main subcomponents
, across a panel of more than 
60 economies since the early 2000s
, are regressed on 
a number of traditional
 drivers
, such as the net 
foreign asset position, GDP growth, terms of trade, the oil trade balance and per capita GDP.
 Table A
 reports the regressions
 results for the dummy variable identifying financial centres. Notably, this 
variable is
 positive and statistically significant in the first 
two
 columns of Tab
le A. This confirms
 that
, everything else being equal, 
financial centres tend to have
 larger 
current account
 surpluses
 and trade
 in goods s
urpluses 
Œ the latter is potentially the outcome of MNE 
merchanting and contract 
manufacturing activities
. Financial centres post
 particularly large surpluses in the services balance 
(see column 
(3) of Table A
), possibly related to financial activities that are not necessarily related to 
MNEs
. In contrast
, financial centres tend to report larger deficits in the investment income balance 
because
 the dummy in column (4) is negative and statistically significant, p
roviding further support to 
the finding related to the income balance of euro area economies
 in Section 3.1
. Finally, further 
analysis 
Œ not included here
 Œ suggests that the positive relationship between the status of financial 
centre
s and the current acc
ount 
(and the negative 
relationship
 between financial centres and 
investment income
) has become stronger in recent years
.

 Drivers of the current account
 and financial centres
 Source: ECB staff calculations.
 Notes: 
The dependent variables are measured as 
a percentage 
of GDP using annual data 
from the period
 2001
-2018. The model for the current account in 
column (1) includes the net foreign asset position, GDP growth, terms of trade, the oil trade balance and per capit
a GDP as control variables. The model for trade 
in goods and services in columns (2) and (3) includes the same regressors
 as in (1), excluding the net foreign asset position. The model for the investment 
income balance in column (4) includes only the oil t
rade balance and the net foreign asset position as control variables. Pooled regressions estimated with 
Prais
-Winsten heteroskedastic panels corrected standard errors (reported in parenthesis) and controlling for panel
-specific autocorrelation of the resid
uals.
 Second, t
he negative income balances recorded by euro area 
financial centres
 partly reflect the redistribution of profits to foreign shareholders.
 The sum of the 
income deficits in 
financial centres
 was 5% of their cumulated GDP in 2018, whereas 
the 
primary surplus in the other euro area economies stood at 1.6% of GDP. 
The 
global value added retained in financial centres is ultimately owned by foreign 
investors that receive an after tax profit which is recorded as income deficits. 
In 
practice
, however
, while
 aggregate income deficits are very common in euro area 
financial centres, not all arise from FDI income. They may also be driven by portfolio 
income, as in the case of Luxembourg and Cyprus. Heterogeneity in income balance 
composition reflects
 spec
ific business model
s, i.e. different 
net direct investment and 
portfolio investment 
asset
 positions
, as well as their 
position in the global capital 
network and 
in relation to
 other 
financial centres.
 Third, t
he practice of moving value added to low
-tax 
euro area 
jurisdictions may 
also 
inflate their trade surpluses
, while producing the opposite effect
 in 
high
er-tax
 economies.
 This is suggested by the different scale of the vertical axes in 
Chart 3. M
NEs pursue several strategies aimed at 
avoiding
 taxes 
that, while vested 
differently, ultimately boil down to value added 
being shifted 
across borders
; these 
strategies
 affect the trade balances
 of euro area countries.

at the end of

 with
 a surplus of 
less than 3%

 financial centres
 has 
tripled
 over the past decade, 
mirroring
 the growth
 in FDI
 recorded in 
the
 financial 
account
 of 
the

entities 
resident in

 have generated a growing 
discrepancy
 between

and 
international

. Different c

 underlying the compilation of

the gap 
between the
se two sources has been growing over time, in particular 
since 
2015 (see 
Chart 4)
. Among e
uro area countries
, financial centres
 account for the 
bulk of the 
growing discrepancy, wh
ereas
 the discrepancy 
has 
remained stable for the other

MNE practices such as change of domicile

Financial centres

 Financial centres 
also 
typically present large deficits in the balance of domestic value added that is

 reflects the fact that
 financial centres
 tend to

 production chain
 as 
the
y are located more
 downstream 
Œ i.e. they are closer to the 
final consumers 
Œ than any other
 participants in 
the 
global production 
network.
 While 
domestic value added exported to final consu
mers (DVA
-DIR
) is 
the dominant component in 
the trade balance of other euro area economies, it is interesting to observe that
 the same component 
measures h
owever more than twice 
the size in financial centres (see blue bars in
 Charts A and B).

-stage
 production of goods and services is 
primarily in intangibles
 Œ the value of these is
 added at the very last stage and constitute
s the 
difference 
between the final price and the factory price of a product.
 If t
ax avoidance is one of the main factors shaping the trade balances in financial centres, then one 
should expect such balances to primarily reflect bilateral balances with higher
 tax

centres. Practices
 that manipulate trade prices
 mostly 
conc

the 
bilateral trade relationships 
between financial and non

 result
ing
 in 
selective trade surpluses. 
As a result, a more granular
 decomposition of the bilateral trade balances
, expressed i
n terms of 
value added content
, shows that 
financial centres
 hold large trade surpluses 
only 
in relation to 
high
er 
taxation jurisdictions
, especially euro area economies (whereas the positions 
in relation to
 other 
financial centres
 are 
more
 balanced
). In conclusion, the dissection of the trade balance in value added shows that financial centres are 
also 
conduits for real transactions. A 
tiny fraction of their total trade 
is 
for 
their 
own domestic consumption
, whereas a
 significant share of their trade r
esponds to different objectives, including

 Euro area foreign direct investment
 FDI 
is a very significant
 component 
of 
the 
euro area™s financial 
account
. In recent years i
t has 
gained prominence as a result of the striking exp
ansion of 
gross 
transactions channelled by
 euro area 
financial centres
 (see 
Chart 
5). Th
e increase
 in gross FDI flows 
in turn
 reflects MNE activit
ies, as discussed in this subsection
. The size of gross FDI flows going through financial centres
 is so large 
that they 
drive the aggregate developments of gross FDI in the euro area as a whole
. FDI
 transiting through 
financial centres is,
 on average
, between two and three times 
higher 
than that recorded by
 the other euro area economies
. It is also three times mor
e volatile. On a net basis
, however, the 
FDI flows of 
the 
other euro area economies 
are 
more important in
 determin
ing
 the aggregate ne
t external position of the euro area 
(see Chart 5

MNE
 activity, gross FDI
 transactions
 in the euro area ha
ve become 
less stable
 and less predictable compared w
ith when FDI mostly 
consisted of mergers and acquisitions and greenfield investment
.61 Furthermore, 
the volatility of gross FDI flows in the euro area, once considered a 
stable source of external financing, rose above that of other financial flows in the 
post-crisis
 period
 (see 
Chart 
5).

 61  The coefficient of variation was computed separately based on groupings of countries (euro area 
financial centres and other euro area economies) for the 
pre
-crisis and post
-2009 periods. An increase 
could be identified only in the volatility of transactions of SPE affiliates resident in financial centres. This 
finding is not driven by one specific financial centre but it emerges as a common pattern of FDI 
in this 
group of economies.

 Multinational enterprises, financial centres and their implications for external imbalances: a 
euro area perspective
  78 gross FDI flows in 
the 
other euro area economies declined
 compared to pre
-crisis 
values.
 Another defining feature of FDI is the strong positive correlation between gross 
assets and liabilities, especially in financial centres
. The very large degree of 
co-movement of FDI inflows and outflows is determined by capital passing through 
financial centres en route to other destinations
 (Chart 
5).62 Complex international 
investment schemes have been engineered 
to take advantage of favourable corporate 
tax 
and legal 
conditions
; this makes financial centres highly interconnected while also 
allowing them to preserve their own business models.
 The bulk o
f FDI transactions 
in financial centres are
 carried out by
 financial 
subsidiaries
 or holding
 companies 
of MNEs, including SPEs
. In fact, other 
financial institutions™ transactions (which include these entities) dominate the
 size and 
dynamics of FDI in fina
ncial centres, whereas NFCs drive gross asset and liabilities 
flows in the other euro area economies 
(see 
Chart 6).
 According to the 
dedicated 
IMF 
Task Force 
(see
 Box 
2), SPE
s are set
 up by MNEs specifically
 to access capital 
markets or sophisticated finan
cial services; isolate owner(s) from financial risks; 
and/or reduce regulatory and tax burden; and/or safeguard confidentiality of their 
transactions and owner(s
).63 Euro area 
financial centres
 offer
 many of the
se advantages
. In particular, they have develo
ped sophisticated
 financial instruments, 
such as 
securitised products.
 The SPEs 
located in euro area financial centres typically
 hold MNE equities, 
manage corporate MNE debt
-issuance, 
and allocate 
financing 
across parent and subsidiaries.

. However, the interpretability of bilateral current account statistics may be affected by the 
existence of bilateral asymmetries.
65 In 2018 the euro area recorded a bilateral current account surplus
 of 
•131 billion
 vis
-à-vis the 
United 
States
, according to
 ECB data, while the euro area surplus amounted to only 
•40 
billion
 in US Bureau 
of Economic Analysis (BEA) data (see
 panel (a) of
 Chart 
A).66 The euro area surplus was around 
•90 billion
 smaller 
according to
 BEA data, due to a
 •23 billion
 smaller area good
s surplus
 and larger euro 
area deficits for services and primary income (by 
•17 billion and •
55 billion, respectively
).67 Panel (b) 
of Chart A reveals that t
he 
current account 
asymmetry has increased over time
, largely d
ue to
 the
 primary income balance, in 
particular in FDI.
 The divergence in recording FDI income is particularly pronounced. In
 2018 a paradox
ical
 situation 
arose, in 
which both the euro area (according to ECB data) and the 
United States 
(according to BEA 
data) record
ed positive income balances vis
-à-vis each other (see
 panel (a) of
 Chart 
B). A large 
difference is observable for FDI income paid to US investors on their investment
s in the euro area, 
with the ECB recording a value around 
•85 billion
 lower than the correspo
nding figure reported by the 
BEA. In contrast, the income euro area residents earned on their FDI investment in the U
nited 
States
 was relatively consistent in 2018 (diverging by around 
•18 
billion
).68 The large discrepancy in FDI 
income paid by the euro are
a to the U
nited 
States
 arises primarily from data on US FDI investment in 
the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland
.

 According to BEA data (

DI in the euro area is invested in holding companies, 
while only around 10% directly reaches euro area manufacturing entities. Holding companies

  83 Differences in the identification of the immediate counterpart country may also contribute to the 
observed asymmetries in FDI income. The
 complexity of MNE
 corporate structures 
makes it difficult 
for statisticians to
 attribute linkages to the correct counterpart countries. There is some evidence 
pointing to differences between the U
nited

 and 
the

 attribute 
sizeable

(MNEs) 
are 
affect
ing
 the external accounts of the euro area and
, in general, 
financial centres
. First, the article presented
 how MNE operations are recorded in 
cross
-border statistics
, as well as the related measurement challenges. Second, 
this 
article showed
 the impact of MNEs on the external accounts of the euro area, which is 
most evident in the current account balances and in foreign direct investment of euro 
area financial centres, 
often involving special
-purpose entities. 
Third, financial centre 
economies generally 
report current account surpluses
 that may be attributed, in part, 
to the activity of MNEs
. Multilateral
 initiatives to improve the transparency of MNE
 operations are 
necessary to ensure exchange
s of information across borders both for tax and 
statistical purposes.
 Such initiatives should help national authorities to take action 
against tax avoidance. 
Moreover, close international cooperation between s
tatistical 
compile
rs Œ including sharing of potentially confidential information 
Œ would help to
 ensure 
consistent cross
-border 
recording of MNE activities
, thereby improving the 
quality and consistency of macroeconomic statistics. In particular, such initiatives 
could help
 to ensure clarity by disentangling the transactions conducted by SPEs in 
the context of FDI in the b.o.p.

  84 2 Short

the ECB
 Prepared by Marta Ba
bura and Lorena Saiz
 1 Introduction
 The real
-time assessment 
of developments in economic activity is of central 
importance for the conduct of monetary policy.
 It facilitates the timely detection of 
changes in underlying economic dynamics in view of incoming data and contributes to a 
broader assessment of the economi
c outlook and associated risks. It is an integral part 
of the economic analysis in the European Central Bank™s (ECB) two
-pillar approach to 
the assessment of the risks to price stability. Moreover, given the time lags in the 
transmission of monetary policy
 measures, a timely and reliable evaluation of economic 
conditions is a key element in the assessment of the monetary policy stance.
 Official estimates of real GDP growth in the euro area are published with some 
delay, 
but current and near
-term development
s in real GDP can be assessed on 
the basis of high
-frequency and timely indicators.
 Real GDP is the key variable 
summarising information on real economic activity. However, it is available only at a 
quarterly frequency and its first official estimate for t
he euro area, the preliminary flash 
estimate, is published only approximately 30 days after the end of the reference 
quarter. To fill this gap, econometric models have been developed at the ECB and 
elsewhere that can exploit a rich set of data to produce a
 real
-time estimate of real 
GDP in the current and next quarter(s). Short
-term forecasts typically rely on financial 
market data, business and consumer surveys or sectoral data (e.g. from industry, retail 
or external sectors). These predictors are often av
ailable at a monthly, weekly or daily 
frequency and with shorter publication delays.
 There are a number of challenges to building quantitative tools for short
-term 
forecasting of economic activity.
 First, these tools need to combine information 
from data c
ollected at different frequencies. Second, they need to deal with the 
ﬁragged edgeﬂ of the data, which is due to the fact that different types of data are 
characterised by different publication delays. For example, industrial production in the 
euro area is
 published around six weeks after the end of the reference month, 
whereas opinion surveys and financial market data are often already available at the 
end of the reference period. Third, as there are many indicators that may be useful, the 
econometric appr
oaches should be able to reliably estimate many parameters. Fourth, 
many indicators are subsequently revised and thus their first release might incorporate 
sizeable noise or measurement error. Fifth, data can be contaminated by outliers, 
caused by unusual 
events (e.g. strikes, atypical weather conditions), or changes in 
statistical properties over time, due to methodological or structural economic changes.
 Further challenges for real
-time forecasting became apparent in the course of 
the global financial cri
sis and 
in its aftermath
. The vast majority of models, 
including those used at the ECB for short
-term forecasting at the time
71, failed to

  85 predict the timing and depth of the Great Recession. In addition, these models 
systematically over
-predicted the stren
gth of the subsequent recovery. Several 
reasons were put forward at the time as an explanation for this disappointing forecast 
performance, including changes in structural relationships between economic 
variables, extreme outcomes in certain indicators tha
t were inconsistent with model 
assumptions, insufficient coverage of financial market data and a non
-linearity in the 
relationship between the real economy and the financial sector. Apart from addressing 
these shortcomings, recommendations for modellers in
cluded developing better tools 
for risk assessment and establishing appropriate economic narratives.
72 The suite of models for short
-term forecasting of euro area real GDP growth 
currently used at the ECB is the result of a comprehensive review conducted in
 2015. The
 models rely on a medium
-size data set of approximately 30 monthly 
indicators.
 A multivariate econometric set
-up and a relatively broad coverage of 
various aspects of the euro area economy provide a framework for
 the interpretation of 
incoming da
ta and 
for
ecast revisions. The 
forecasts
 are 
prepared using automated 
procedures
 (i.e. 
they are 
judgement
-free) and 
can be produced in a matter of minutes
. In addition to point forecasts
, the model suite
 can 
also 
produce predictive distributions 
(fan chart
s). 
The latter can be used to assess, in real time, the degree of uncertainty 
around, or the risks to, the prevailing outlook for the short term.
 The model
-based short
-term forecasts of real GDP are an important input to the 
Eurosystem/ECB staff macroecono
mic projections.
73 By delivering quantitative 
estimates of real GDP growth ahead of the 
official data 
release 
and by providing an 
assessment of 
the macroeconomic ﬁnewsﬂ since the completion of the previous 
projection round
, they are a useful starting point 
for updating the baseline short
-term 
outlook for GDP growth. In addition, 
the pr
edictive distributions provide model
-based 
input for
 assessing the balance of risks surrounding the
 staff GDP 
projection
s. The article is organised as follows.
 Section 2 explai
ns the methodological framework 
of the suite of models for short
-term forecasting of real GDP at the ECB. Section 3 
presents an evaluation of the forecast performance of the models. Section 4 focuses on 
two interesting elements of the suite of models: news
 analysis and predictive 
distributions. Finally, Section 5 concludes with the main lessons learned and discusses 
the current challenges, further planned enhancements and new directions of work.
 2 Methodological framework
 Several types of models for short
-term forecasting of real GDP have been 
proposed in the literature, including bridge equations, mixed
-frequency 
dynamic factor models
, mixed
-frequency vector autoregressions and 
Mixed 
Data Sampling (

 models.
 Traditionally, ﬁbridge equationsﬂ, linking G
DP to a 
few key monthly indicators aggregated to a quarterly frequency, have been used. The 
latter are forecast using simple ﬁauxiliaryﬂ models to complete the missing

  86 observations for the quarter. More recent approaches include mixed
-frequency 
dynamic fac
tor models and mixed
-frequency
 vector 
autoregression
s, which allow a 
single modelling framework to be used for the entire information set. Finally, MIDAS 
models allow data of different frequencies to be combined in a regression set
-up by 
imposing a parsimo
nious lag structure. Different model types offer different 
advantages, in particular as regards robustness to structural breaks and extreme data 
outcomes or the possibility to interpret forecast revisions.
74 The 2015 review of the ECB™s short
-term 
forecasting models was motivated by 
the deterioration in the (relative) performance of the models in the course of the 
global financial crisis
 and in its aftermath
. The 
suite of models used at the time 
encompassed (several versions) of bridge equations and
 large
-scale mixed
-frequency 
dynamic factor models. Both model types exhibited large forecast errors during the 
crisis and a positive bias (systematic over
-prediction) thereafter, but the problems 
were more acute for the factor models. One of the reasons b
ehind the positive bias 
was the insufficient coverage of the services sector and a declining contribution of the 
industry sector to value added in the euro area. Another reason was the difficulty to 
reliably estimate relationships between a large set of va
riables in view of their different 
behaviour during the financial crisis (in particular for 
survey 
vs. 
ﬁhardﬂ
75 data). The 
forecast performance of the mixed
-frequency factor models appears to have been 
more sensitive to such structural changes compared with
 the performance of the 
bridge equations.
 The current suite of short
-term forecast models 
is based on bridge equations, 
in view of their comparatively better post
-financial crisis forecast performance.
 Two types of bridge equations are included: (i) equati
ons based on ﬁhardﬂ data, linking 
GDP to industrial production (excluding construction) and value added in services, and 
(ii) equations based on ﬁsoftﬂ data, linking GDP to Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) 
composite output and PMI construction.
76 Both types
 embody
 the 
ﬁsupply
ﬂ perspective for real GDP measurement
77, given that 
the coverage of information is 
more complete and timelier and the relationship with GDP is more stable compared 
with the ﬁdemandﬂ perspective. As a consequence, the supply perspective r
esults in 
more accurate forecasts. The forecasts for (quarterly) value added in services are 
obtained via an auxiliary bridge equation.
 The monthly predictors included in the bridge equations are in turn forecast 
using ﬁauxiliaryﬂ models and incorporate in
formation from other monthly 
variables.
 Since bridge equations typically include just a few predictors, the only way to 
exploit a larger (and timelier) set of information in such a framework is through monthly

  87 auxiliary models to produce forecasts of the p
redictors.
78 The auxiliary models for the 
bridge equations are monthly Bayesian vector autoregressions and dynamic factor 
models. Both types of models allow a large number of variables to be incorporated.
 The data set comprises approximately 30 indicators.
 It includes industrial 
production and business surveys for different sectors, monthly indicators of retail 
trade, unemployment, external trade and financial market data. The data set can be 
considered a ﬁmediumﬂ size and is significantly smaller than those
 underlying the 
mixed
-frequency factor models used previously. Forecast evaluations conducted 
during the review have shown that a very granular sectoral disaggregation typical for 
large data sets does not result in improved forecast accuracy.
79 Forecasts ar
e obtained as an average of forecasts
 produced by
 individual 
models.
 Combining two types of bridge equations with five auxiliary models results in 
ten distinct models for GDP. For point forecasts, an average of the individual model 
predictions is taken. 
Pooling individual forecasts lead
s to gains in forecast accuracy
, even with respect to the best
-performing 
model version
80, see below
. Predictive 
distributions (densities) are produced via simulations and combined predictive density 
is calculated as an averag
e of the individual model predictive densities. More technical 
details can be found in Box 1.
 Box 1
 The suite of models for short
-term forecasting of real GDP in the euro area: some technical 
details
 The models used belong to the family of bridge equations. A bridge equation is a linear regression 
model where the dependent variable is the low
-frequency variable of interest (e.g. quarterly GDP) 
and the regressors are higher
-frequency predictors (e.g. mo
nthly industrial production) aggregated to 
the lower frequency. In the case of the models for short
-term forecasting of real GDP in the euro area 
described in the main text, the equations are specified as follows:
 =+,+, where 
 is the dependent variable, in this case quarter
-on-quarter real GDP growth, and 
, are 
the predictor variables (up to 
 per bridge equation). 
Two types of bridge equations are included
. In 
the first bridge equation, the predictor varia
bles are: quarterly growth of industrial production and 
quarterly growth of value added in services. In the second equation, the predictors are: quarterly 
average of PMI composite output and quarterly difference of PMI construction output

  88 regression residual,
  is the intercept and 
 are the regression coefficients. For 
value added in 
services, an auxiliary bridge equation including expected demand for services from the surveys of the 
European Commission is used. The equations are estima
ted by standard regression techniques 
(ordinary least squares). The estimation sample starts in 1985 or later, depending on data availability 
in the particular equation (or ﬁauxiliaryﬂ model, see below).
 In order to obtain forecasts for GDP from the equati
ons described above, it is necessary to obtain 
forecasts for the monthly predictors for the quarters of interest. For this purpose,
 ﬁauxiliaryﬂ 
multivariate models at 
a monthly frequency 
are used
: vector autoregressions (VARs) and dynamic 
factor models (DF
Ms).
82 The former are estimated 
with Bayesian methods, using a specification in 
first differences
 with six lags
 and the Minnesota prior
 with the degree of shrinkage dependent on the 
size of the model
.83 The 
latter
 are estimated by maximum likelihood, using t
he expectation 
maximi
sation algorithm.
84 The specification includes one single common factor
, which follows an 
autoregressive process of order two and 
an autoregressive process of order one
 for
 the idiosyncratic 
components.
 Both types of models can deal with large sets of variables. VARs of three sizes 
(including two, 22 or 28 variables) and DFMs of two sizes (with 22 and 28 variables) are
 included. In 
order to handle the ragged edge caused by different publication delays of
 the variables, the models 
are cast into a state space representation and t
he Kalman filter and smoother are used
 to obtain the 
forecasts of the monthly variables and the weights for the news (see Section 4).
 The variables for the bridge equations and the 
monthly ﬁauxiliaryﬂ models were selected on the basis 
of several 
criteria including correlation analysis, in
-sample and out
-of-sample forecast performance, 
stability 
and significance 
of regression coefficients 
as well as
 shrinkage methods such as LASSO 
reg
ressions.
85 The result
s confirmed previous findings in the literature that a very high level of 
disaggregation (100 series or more) is not needed to achieve the best forecast accuracy.
 The computation of the models™ predictive distributions (densities) reli
es on the use of the Gibbs 
sampler and the simulation smoother (in order to handle the ragged edge).
86 The density forecasts 
from
 individual 
model
s are combined by a linear opinion pool with equal weights 
attached to 
individual 
densities.
 Combinations of no
rmal densities produce distributions which can accommodate 
non
-standard features such as fat tails or skewness. As for the case of point forecasts, pooling 
density forecasts is also an i
nsurance

 Short
-term forecasting of euro area economic activity at the ECB
  89 3 Forecast p
erformance
 A real
-time evaluation is conducted of the forecasting accuracy of the models 
since their introduction and over a longer period starting in 2005.
 For this 
purpose, real
-time data vintages
 going back to 2005
 are
 constructed
 based on the 
informati
on stored in the ECB™s Statistical Data Warehouse (SDW).
88 For each 
quarter in the evaluation sample, 12 forecast horizons are considered. The first 
forecast is obtained five months ahead of the first official publication. Subsequent 
forecasts are produced 
in semi
-monthly intervals, up to two weeks before the 
publication of the preliminary flash estimate.
89 For instance, in the forecast cycle for 
the second quarter of the year, the first forecast would be produced 
at the end of 
January
 and the last one in the
 second week of July
. The evaluation focuses on the 
bias and the root mean squared error of the forecasts. The forecasts are evaluated 
against the official flash estimates and the latest available vintage of 
quarter
-on-quarter real GDP growth.
 The forecast
 accuracy of the models is compared 
with
 that of the 
Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections.
 For the purpose of the 
evaluation, a convention is adopted in line with which the latter are finalised in the 
middle of the second month of each quarter (corresponding to the forecast horizon of 
1.5 and 4.5 months ahead for the current and the next quarte
r, respectively) and they 
remain unchanged in between.
90 The accuracy of the models improves as new information arrives and the 
models fare relatively well compared 
with
 the Eurosystem/ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections.
 Chart 1 shows t
he root mean squared
 forecast error 
(RMSFE)
 and the bias for the model forecasts (light
-coloured lines) as well as the 
projections (dark
-coloured lines) compared with the official flash estimate (red lines) 
and with the latest vintage (blue lines) of GDP growth for the 12 for
ecast horizons 
considered. The evaluation period is 2015Q1 to 2019Q2.
91 Overall, the accuracy of 
the model forecasts is somewhat lower than that of the projections. The precision of 
the model forecasts
 gradually 
improves
 with a d
ecreasing forecast horizon a
nd the 
forecasts appear particularly useful at very short horizons after the projections have 
been finalised. Both the forecasts and the projections are more accurate and less 
biased when they are compared with the flash estimate than when they are compare
d with the latest available vintage of GDP.
                                         
                           
 88  For a given date stamp and indicator identifier, a time series available at that date can be recovered from 
the SDW. Thus real
-time data vintages re
flect both publication delays and data revisions (as opposed to 
pseudo real
-time vintages that reflect only the former).
 89  This reflects the frequency and the forecast horizon of the regular updates of short
-term forecasts at the 
ECB. They are generally c
onducted twice per month, following the release of industrial production in the 
middle of each month, and of opinion surveys at the end of each month. The forecasts are always 
reported for the next two quarters to be published.
 90  As a consequence, the acc
uracy of the projections reported in Chart 1 changes in the middle of the 
second month of each quarter as a new projection becomes available. The projections are customarily 
finalised between the middle and the end of the second month of each quarter.
 91  Since no changes have been implemented to the models since 2015, this is a truly real
-time 
out-of-sample evaluation.

For each quarter a sequence of 12 real

The f

 (indicated on the horizontal axis)
 is defined as the distance (in months) between the end of the reference quarter and the date when the forecast was made. 
A convention 
is adopted in line with which 
Eurosystem/ECB sta
ff macroeconomic 
projections
 are finalised around the middle of the second month of 
each quarter (1.5 or 4.5 months before the end of the reference quarter). Bias is defined as the average difference between t
he forecast 
and the outcome. Model forecasts an
d the 
projections are evaluated against the 
official flash estimate of
 GDP 
growth
 (released in the 
middle of the second month of the following quarter
) as well as against the latest available vintage of real GDP growth.
 The models also perform relatively w
ell when evaluated over a longer period.
 The evaluation period considered above is relatively short and less volatile than, for 
example, the preceding period, which included the financial and sovereign debt crises. 
Focusing on the RMSFEs for 1.5

d horizon with the flash estimate as the 
reference variable, Chart 2 presents the evolution of forecast accuracy since 2005 
over an eight
-quarter window. Several observations can be made. First, 
unsurprisingly, the financial crisis period was characterised
 by much larger forecast 
errors, both for models and for the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections. 
By contrast, the errors were not particularly large during the sovereign debt crisis. 
Second, the average model forecast is more accurate than the

 4 News analysis and a measure of risks
 4.1
 News analysis
 The current framework allows linking revisions to the GDP growth forecast to 
model
-based surprises or news
 content in releases of monthly pre
dictors.
 This 
is also known as model
-based news analysis and is an important element of data 
monitoring. The news (or surprise) for each indicator is defined as the difference 
between the released value of that indicator and its expected (forecast) value, 
i.e. the 
forecast error made by the model. The difference between two consecutive forecasts 
of GDP, that is the forecast revision, can be expressed as a weighted average of the 
news in the data released between the two forecast updates (plus the effect of 
historical data revisions and parameter re
-estimation).
93 The weight
s reflect the 
                                        
                           
 92  It should be noted that 
although the estimation of 
and the forecasts from 
the models 
are
 performed 
using
 real
-time
 data
, the 
specification and the choice of the variables
 in the
 new models

 Density forecasts

make it 
possible to
 assess the uncertainty around the point forecast as well as the 
direction and the degree of risks to forecasts f
rom other sources such as the 
staff projections
. For example, when the centre of the 
mod
el predictive 
density
 (as 
represented by its mode or its median) is to the left of a
n alternative
 forecast, it signals 
downward risks to the latter and vice versa. Consequently, movements to the left or 
right of the pr
edictive
 density
 will imply changes in
 the assessment of the direction of 
risks. By contrast, changes in the shape of the distribution (i.e. dispersion or 
concentration) will imply changes in th
e level of uncertainty. In real

  93 more information is accrued over the forecast cycl
e, the predictive distribution usually 
becomes more concentrated, entailing less uncertainty surrounding the central 
forecast. 
It cannot be ruled out
, however,
 that the release of one or several indicators 
could lead to a flatter distribution, due to diver
ging interpretations by the different 
models, and therefore to higher uncertainty.
 As an example, predictive distributions indicate that, on the basis of these 
models, initially there were downward risks to the June 2019
 Eurosystem staff 
GDP projection
 for
 2019Q2 and the balance of risks became more neutral as 
more data became available.
 Chart 4 presents the models™ predictive densities for 
2019Q2 obtained with the data available on 17 May 2019 (around the finalisation of 
the June 2019 staff projection) and
 on 12 July 2019.
 Initially, the 
models 
suggested 
downside risks to the project
ion
 since the probability of 
a lower 
outcome was 
highe
r than 50% (i.e. 
60%). 
As more information became available
 by mid
-July, the 
distribution
 moved to the right and became more concentrated. 
This means that
 the 
risks to the project
ion
 became more balanced (given that the 
probability of 
observing 
an 
outcome 
either 
above
 or below the projected value was around 50%) and smaller.

 Short
-term forecasting of euro area economic activity at the ECB
  94 Several lessons on how to 
address those and other challenges can be drawn 
from the experience with model
-based short
-term forecasting of real economic 
activity at the ECB.
 First, it is important to have several models in the toolbox and 
to 
assess
 the
ir performance
 regularly
, as it 
may 
deteriorate 
over time. Second, 
a combination
 of forecasts from different models
 typically helps to make the 
forecast 
performance more robust
 to misspecification
. Third,
 including information on all major 
sectors of the economy is important but it
 is no
t necessary to use 
data sets at a very 
high level of disaggregation. A medium
-size set of relevant and timely 
indicators
 appears to be sufficient to capture the information on real activity developments in the 
near term. F
inally, it is important to 
be able
 to interpret the revisions to the outlook and 
to 
communicate uncertainty surrounding the forecasts.
 Still, scope for further 
improvement along several dimensions remains.
 One issue is the high reliance of short
-term forecasting models on survey data.
 Surv
eys provide qualitative information (i.e. opinions or perceptions) from relatively 
small samples of firms or consumers. They are very relevant due to their short 
publication lag. However, their relationship with quantitative (hard) indicators can 
change ov
er time, reflecting either sampling biases (e.g. survival bias, especially after 
the crisis) or the fact that survey respondents can change the benchmarks used for 
their assessments (e.g. value of sales growth which can be considered an 
improvement in the 
firm™s performance).
94 As a result, the mapping of survey data 
levels into economic growth rates is not straightforward. For instance, at the beginning 
of 2018 survey data were at historically high levels
95, while real GDP growth slowed 
down considerably in 
the euro area. Conversely, some of the surveys painted a rather 
bleak outlook for 2019, while hard data turned out somewhat more resilient.
 Alternative models and indicators can be employed to further enhance the 
accuracy and robustness of the models curre
ntly employed.
 Examples include 
time
-varying parameter models that can deal with relationships that change over time 
in a flexible way.
96 The usefulness of alternative indicators and methods is also being 
investigated, in particular of machine learning algo
rithms and ﬁbig dataﬂ. The term ﬁbig 
dataﬂ is rather broad. In this context, it includes large and near
-real
-time data from the 
internet (e.g. internet search volumes
97, data from social networks such as Twitter and 
Facebook, newspaper articles) or large
-volume data from non
-official sources (e.g. 
from trading platforms and payment systems). Big data allows a wider range of 
indicators to be used, which can provide new and unique insights helpful for 
forecasting. For instance, text
-based sentiment indicators 
could be particularly useful 
given that they can be produced automatically at a high frequency and at lower costs 
than survey
-based sentiment indicators, and they can be based on large samples of

 considering a large set of explanatory variables

 Some of 
these challenges can be addressed by machine learning algorithms, which also

  96 3 The 
state of play 
regarding t
he deepening agenda
 for 
Economic and Monetary Union
 Prepared by Sander Tordoir, Jacopo Carma
ssi, Sebastian Hauptmeier 
and Malte Jahning
99 This 
article
 provides an 
overview of
 progress 
with various aspects of the 
deepening of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
 The start of a new legislative 
period for the European Union
 (2019
-24) provides a natural and opportune 
moment to 
take stock of progress towards completi
on of the
 architecture of EMU.
 The 
EU™s last
 two legislat
ive periods
 saw significant progress 
as regards
 the 
architecture of EMU
 in response to the 
global financial 
crisis m
ore than a 
decade ago.
 A banking union was established, with shared supervision of Europe™s 
largest banks at supranational level and a common framework for addressing and 
resolving ailing banks. T
he European Stability Mechanism (ESM) 
was put in place to 
support euro area countries facing deep economic crises. And a number of 
adjustments
 were made to the
 shared rules governing national fiscal and economic 
policies
. However, there is no room for complacency:
 EMU 
needs to become even 
more 
resilient 
to 
adverse 
economic 
shocks.
 An increase in private risk sharing (whereby 
firms and households diversify their assets across borders through integrated capital 
and banking markets) can help to mitigate local recessions by allowing local shocks to 
be offset using incom
e received from elsewhere. An increase in public risk sharing 
(e.g. through some form of
 common fiscal policy
 or shared backstops that safeguard 
financial stability in times of crisis) can also help to attenuate local and even euro 
area
-wide recessions.
 Such private and public risk
 sharing 
are still more limited
 in the 
euro area than 
they are 
in other monetary unions
, such as the United States. 
At the 
same time, the governance 
mechanisms that 
help to 
ensure resilient policies at 
national level 
and seek to p
revent harmful spillover effects between euro area 
countries 
could be strengthened
 further
. Concrete decisions and further work on
 a number of 
aspects of 
EMU 
are 
scheduled for the near future
. This include
s work on the 
banking union 
and the 
capital markets union (CMU), both of which remain incomplete, leaving scope to 
further increase the stability and integration of Europe™s banking and capital markets. 
Other initiatives include 
reform of the 
ESM as part of work in the area of crisis
 management,
 as well as
 the 
establishment of a
 budgetary instrument for convergence 
and competitiveness 
(BICC), which aims to help euro area countries to invest and 
implement reforms with a view to improving the structure of their economies. 
In 
addition, t
he 
European 
Commission is
 also reviewing 
the fiscal and economic 
governance framework 
that coordinates national policies 
and
 is set to
 table a proposal 
for a European unemployment reinsurance scheme as a way o
f enhanc
ing
 the euro 
area™s ability to withstan
d economic downturns.

 The state of play regarding the deepening agenda for Economic and Monetary Union
  97 The ECB 
has
 a clear interest
 in 
increasing the resilience of
 the 
euro area™s 
institutional architecture.
 Sound countercyclical fiscal policies, sufficient financial 
resilience and cross
-border private and public risk sharing are 
all i
mportant to
 the ECB 
in order 
to allow for more effective transmission of monetary policy with fewer side 
effects, enhance the alignment of euro area business cycles, complement monetary 
policy and 
give
 European
 banking supervision
 greater traction
. Against
 that backdrop, this article provides 
an 
overview of 
various
 different 
elements of the deepening agenda
 for 
EMU
 and
 identifies
 a number of 
outstanding issues
. 1 Introduction
 Completing the institutional architecture of EMU will be an important challenge 
for the EU during the 2019
-24 legislative period.
 A new European Parliament was 
elected in May 2019, 
and 
the new Commission President
, Ursula von der Leyen
, outlined her priorities in July 
2019, before taking office on 1 December 2019
 alongside
 the new 
College of
 Com
mission
ers
. Meanwhile, the EU™s heads of state or 
government
 set out
 ten priorities 
for the European Union for the period 2019
-24 in 
a declaratio
n in Sibiu on 9 May 2019.
100 Responsibility for r
eforming the architecture of EMU is shared 
by all EU 
institutions and Member States.
 The Commission 
plays
 a key role 
by tabling 
proposals 
(including legislative drafts
), which are adopted by the ECOFIN Council
 (the 
finance 
ministers of the EU27), 
typically in cooperation
 with the European Parliament. 
In policy terms, the Eurogroup (
the f
inance 
ministers 
of 
euro area 
countries, who are
 sometimes 
joined in meetings by
 the 
finance ministers of 
non
 -euro area count
ries) is 
the main locus 
when it comes to
 giving strategic guidance and negotiatin
g the 
deepening of
 the euro area
™s architecture. 
Ultimate
ly,
 political decisions on EMU are 
taken 
at Euro Summit
s, which bring together the heads of state or government of eur
o area countries. Different decision
-making
 processes apply if policy areas are 
intergovernmental (e.g. 
with
in the framework of the ESM). The ECB participates in 
these EU and euro area fora and acts as an advis
er on EMU reforms. 
Thus, r
eforms to 
EMU are 
a product of the interplay between these various actors and their 
competences in the legislative process.
 The
 EU™s last
 two legislat
ive periods
 saw significant progress on the 
architecture of EMU
 (as outlined in Figure 1)
. The introduction of the Single 
Sup
ervisory Mechanism (SSM) and 
the 
Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) 
delivered two of the three pillars of 
the 
banking union
, with the third pillar 
Œ a European 
Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) 
Œ left incomplete.
 This built on 
institutional 
innovations achiev
ed during the crisis, such as the 
creation
 of the ESM, reform
s to fiscal rules
, and the establishment of the 
macroeconomic 
imbalance 
procedure (MIP) 
in order 
to address harmful macroeconomic imbalances
. These 
were all key 
steps 
with 
a view to 
reduc
ing
 fina
ncial and macroeconomic risks
, improving 
risk
 sharing
, and 
enhancing the transmission of
 monetary policy across the euro area
.

SGP and establishing the MIP; the ﬁtwo
-packﬂ comprises regulations aimed at strengthening the budgetary surveillance cycle in EMU; 
and the ﬁfiscal compactﬂ is an intergovernmental treaty on the anchoring of fiscal rules in national constitutions.
 However, that deepening of EMU has lost its initial momentum.
 Private and public 
risk
 sharing 
are still more limited
 in the euro area than 
they are 
in other monetary 
unions 
(such as the United States
). The banking union remains incomplete without 
the
 EDIS
, and further progress is needed on 
the establishment of
 a genuine CMU. On the 
fiscal side, 
the
 euro area 
continues to lack a 
central fiscal
 capacity for 
the purposes of 
macroeconomic stabilisation. At the same time, mechanisms 
aimed a
t ensur
ing
 resilient policies at national level could be strengthened
 further. The Stability and 
Growth Pact (SGP) is widely 
regarded
 as requiring simplification
 in order 
to make the 
EU™s fiscal rules more effective and countercyclical and improve ownership at national 
level, whil
e the implementation rate 
for
 structural reforms under the European 
Semester and the effectiveness of the MIP 
both 
remain 
poor
. A deeper and more 
complete EMU 
(including 
an enhanced
 CMU
) would
, in the context of the pursuit of 
sound economic policies
101 in the euro area, also support the international role of the 
euro.
102 The deepening of EMU is just one of a number of challenges facing the 
Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.

104 The Sibiu Declaration
, in 
which Europe™s heads of state or government set out the
 EU™s strategic agenda for 
the 
period 
2019-24,105 contained 
a reference to 
the

 EMU under the general 
heading ﬁDeveloping our economic base: the European model for the futureﬂ. Charles 
Michel, the new Council President, will 
be tasked with 
follow
ing
 up on th
at declaration
 and has indicated that enhancing
 EMU
 is particularly relevant in the context of 
strengthening the international role of the euro
.106 Alongside issues such as 
investment, employment and inequality, the European Parliament has called for 
further progress on all aspects of the deepening of EMU
 and has asked the 
Commission to table proposals in this regard.
107 Further decisions and follow
-up work on a number of 
different aspects of the
 deepening 
of EMU
 are scheduled
 for the near future
. The Euro Summit 
of 
13 December
 2019 took stock
 of ongoing wor
k in relation to the 
banking union
, with the
 High
-Level Working Group
 on a European Deposit Insurance Scheme being tasked, 
under the aegis of the Eurogroup, with drawing up proposals with a view to 
establishing a roadmap towards completion of the banking u
nion. It also took note of 
the 
planned 
reform of the ESM 
(on 
which high 
-level agreement had been
 reached 
at the 
Eurogroup™s 
December 
2019 meeting)
 and the 
main features
 of the BICC. 
For the 
remainder of 2020, the work programmes of the various EU fora 
foresee that
 the ESM 
reform package will be ratified by national parliaments, the BICC will be legislated 
for 
by the 
European 
Parliament and 
the 
Council
, and 
the
 High
-Level Forum established 
by the Commission will put forward proposals for new CMU prioriti
es. Moreover, work 
towards 
the establishment of 
a comprehensive banking union package is likely to 
continue, a review of the fiscal and economic governance framework is to be 
undertaken by the Commission, technical discussions on a fiscal capacity 
for the 
euro 
area will continue
, and a new proposal for a European unemployment reinsurance 
scheme 
may potentially
 be made
. The next section will provide more details on these 
various 
work streams

regarded immigrat
ion as a pressing issue for the EU, while a cumulative 38% (up 3
 percentage points) 
regarded climate change and the environment as priorities at EU level. In contrast, only 18% of euro area 
respondents (unchanged from the previous survey) regarded the econ
omic situation as a priority, with

 The state of play regarding the deepening agenda for Economic and Monetary Union
  100 2 State of play as regards the various elements of EMU 
architectur
e The
 structure and approach advocated by the 
Four and Five Presidents™ 
Reports 
in 2012 and 2015 respectively provide a useful framework for analysing 
the current state of play.
108 Those reports, which were written by the Presidents of 
the European Commissio
n, the European Council, the Eurogroup, the European 
Central Bank and 
Œ in the case of the Five Presidents™ Report 
Œ the European 
Parliament, set out a comprehensive roadmap. Both reports structured
 their
 architectural proposals around four unions 
(financi
al, fiscal, economic and political
) and argued
 that there was important interplay between th
ose unions. Fo
r example, 
advance
s in the 
banking union would reduce
 any negative feedback loops between 
struggling banks and the fiscal health of sovereigns, thereb
y reducing 
the 
need for 
public money and
 public 
risk
 sharing
.109 At the same time, private and public risk
 sharing 
were 
not 
just seen
 as 
substitutes
; they were regarded
 as complementary. 
The 
Four and Five Presidents™ Reports 
also combined propos
als
 aimed at 
achieving risk 
reduction and 
convergence with 
proposals
 encouraging
 more risk
 sharing 
Œ recognising that risk
 sharing, if 
designed
 appropriately, reinforces
 risk reduction.
 Finally, those
 reports proposed a
n approach to 
the
 deepening
 of EMU
, linking risk
 sharing and risk reduction in a comprehensive roadmap
 with a timeline and clear 
milestones
. That vision was based
 largely on a resilience narrative 
Œ a desire to 
mak
e the euro area 
more
 resilient 
and better able
 to withstand 
any new crisis.
110 While th
at kind
 of 
holistic perspective 
continues to exist
 in the background and can serve as a 
useful benchmark, it is important to understand that
, in practice,
 discussions in the 
various 
EU fora 
tend to now 
follow more of a dossier
-by-dossier approach. 
Consequently, t
he sections below 
review the various individual dossiers in turn, but 
group them together in a manner similar to that applied in the Four and Five 
Presidents™ Reports.
 2.1
 Banking union
 The financial crisis highlighted the need to make structural improveme
nts to 
Europe
™s institutional framework 
in order 
to safeguard finan
cial stability and 
create a level playing field across the euro area
. The Four Presidents™ Report
 of June 2012 propos
ed the establishment of
 an integrated financial framework, building 
on the single rulebook, with a single European banking superviso
r and a common 
deposit insurance and resolution framework. Th
at report argued that 
a single banking 
superviso
r was needed to ensure uniform applica
tion of prudential rules and 
ensure 
that 
banks in all Member States
 were supervised with the same degree of 
effectiveness

  101 The Four Presidents™
 Report also included proposals on bank resolution and 
deposit insurance.
 That report proposed the establishment 
of a European resolution 
scheme 
(to be funded primarily 
via
 contributions 
from
 banks
) which could 
ensure the 
harmonised 
application of resolution measures to banks overseen by European 
supervis
ion
, with the goal of 
ensuring the 
orderly winding
-down 
of 
non
 -viable 
institutions and protecting taxpayer
s™ money
. Finally, on 
the subject of 
deposit 
insurance
, the report proposed the 
introduction
 of a European dimension to national 
deposit guarantee schemes for banks under European supervision, with the objective 
of 
increasing
 the credibility of existing arrangements and 
ensuring that depositors 
have
 sufficient protection.
 The Five Presidents™
 Report, 
which was 
published in June 2015, reiterated the 
key messages of the Four Presidents™
 Report 
as regards the banking
 union, 
but 
also 
included
 a new and more detailed proposal 
for
 an EDIS.
 It called for the 
establishment of an EDIS as the third pillar of 
the b
anking 
union in order to increase 
resilience against future crises, 
since
 the current set
-up with national deposi
t guarantee schemes was considered 
to be 
vulnerable to large local shocks, particular
ly whe
re both
 the sovereign 
in question 
and the 
national 
banking sector 
were
 perceived 
to be fragile. 
That report argued that a European scheme 
was
 also more likely to be 
fiscally neutral over time than national schemes, 
since
 risks would be spread more 
widely and contributions
 to the European deposit insurance fund (ex ante and 
risk
-based)
 would be raised 
across
 a much larger pool of financial insti
tutions. While 
the report acknowledged that setting up a fully
 fledged EDIS would take time, it 
argued 
in favour of
 tak
ing a number of
 concrete steps as a start
ing point
, building on the 
existing framework 
Œ for example, by designing 
the 
EDIS as a reinsura
nce system for 
national deposit guarantee schemes.
 As originally proposed by the Four and Five Presidents™ Reports, the 
banking 
union 
should comprise 
three pillars
 (as illustrated in Table 1)
: (i) 
common
 supervision under the SSM; (ii) common resolution
 arrangements
 under the 
SRM
; and (iii) 
common
 deposit insurance under a
n EDIS
 (which has yet to be 
established)
. The banking union
 is underpinned by a single rulebook
, which builds on 
key contributions by the various European supervisory authorities (ESAs), w
ith the 
European Banking Authority (EBA) having specific responsibility for the banking 
sector
. The SSM is tasked with 
ensur
ing
 the safety and soundness o
f the European 
banking system, fostering
 financial integration and stability
, and 
ensur
ing
 consistent 
supervision
. Those objectives are achieved by adopting
 a uniform
 approach to day 
-to-day supervision, by implementing
 harmonised supervisory actions and corrective 
measures
, and by 
ensuring the consistent application of regulations and supervisory 
policies
. The SRM
 and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
 (BRRD) have 
strengthened the euro area™s
 crisis management
 framework
, with the aim of reducing 
the cost
 of future bank failures
 for taxpayers and the real economy and tackling the 
bank
-sovereign nexu
s. As regards the third pillar, the European Commission 
presented a proposal for an EDIS in November 2015. That proposal envisaged a 
gradual process, starting with reinsurance (whereby the European deposit insurance 
fund would intervene only after national sc
hemes had been exhausted, and only within 
certain limits) and ending with a fully fledged European deposit insurance scheme 
(whereby the European fund would intervene immediately, with full coverage of all

  102 financial needs relating to deposit insurance func
tions). However, no agreement has 
yet been reached on this issue, and discussions are still ongoing. Establishing the 
third pillar of the banking union is crucial to ensure uniform deposit protection across 
the euro area, regardless of a bank™s location. T
his, in turn, will preserve depositors™ 
confidence, prevent bank runs and safeguard financial stability, thereby 
complementing the supervisory pillar. It will also help to address the bank
-sovereign 
nexus, as it will prevent national governments from being
 called upon to act as a 
backstop for national deposit guarantee schemes, thereby complementing the 
resolution pillar. Thus, all three pillars of the banking union will be complementary and 
mutually reinforcing. It is therefore of the essence that the thir
d pillar is established, 
completing the architecture of the banking union. 
Outside observers 
such as
 the IMF 
have also called for the banking union 
to be completed 
in a comprehensive 
manner.

  103 area.
113 Those achievements include the harmonisation of supervisory practices
, as 
well as significant improvement
s to a number of 
risk metrics, 
such as
 capital buffers, 
liquidity reserves and 
non
-performing loans.
 The establishment of the second pillar of the banking union was also rapid and 
represents a key milestone in the process of strengthening Europe™s bank 
resoluti
on framework.
 The SRM, with the Single Resolution Board (SRB) at its 
heart
 and the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) provid
ing
 resolution financing, has been 
operational 
since
 2016. 
The SRF pools contributions 
received
 from credit institutions 
in the banking un
ion
 and has
 a target 
capacity 
of at least 1% of 
the total 
covered 
deposits of all authorised credit institutions in participating Member States
, which must 
be reached
 by 
the 
end 
of 
2023. Under the 
supervision
 of resolution authorities, banks 
are in the pro
cess of building up loss
-absorption capacit
y as required by the minimum 
requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL).
 MREL liabilities include 
regulatory capital, but they also include other liabilities (e.g. senior unsecured bonds) 
which are
 deemed able to absorb losses and contribute to recapitalisation needs in the 
event of resolution. At
 the Euro Summit
 in 
June 2018
, it was
 agreed that the ESM 
would provide a 
common 
backstop to the SRF in the form of a revolving credit line, 
starting in 20
24. That backstop will have the same firepower as the SRF (i.e. 1% of 
covered deposits), thus doubling the resources that are available to support and 
facilitate bank resolution.
 Moreover, it was agreed at the Euro Summit in December 
2018 that the backstop
 could be introduced before 2024 if sufficient risk reduction had 
been achieved in banks™ balance sheets. Work on making the backstop operational is 
ongoing.
 Despite the progress made so far, the banking union remains incomplete
. Outstanding issues include
 regulatory fragmentation, gaps in the crisis management 
framework (e.g. the lack of a harmonised insolvency regime), the absence of a 
common deposit insurance 
scheme
, and the lack of a common framework for the 
provision of liquidity in resolution. 
A numbe
r of these elements are linked
, and in June 
2019 the
 High
-Level 
Working 
Group 
on a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (which 
consist
s of 
members of the 
Eurogroup Working Group
) was
 tasked with
 carrying out 
further
 technical work 
and identifying
 a transitional path 
with a view 
to address
ing
 unresolved
 issues and mov
ing
 towards 
a steady state banking union
 (see Table 1 for 
an overview of the various elements)
. At the Eurogroup meeting on 4 December 2019, 
the Chair of the High
-Level Working Group p
ut forward several proposals
:114  An EDIS should be established, initially covering only liquidity needs, but 
eventually encompassing also loss coverage in line with progress on risk 
reduction.
 In the initial phase, a
 hybrid approach could be adopted, providi
ng

a ﬁEuropean

ﬂ (i.e. safe assets and the role they play in the banking sector)

  Proposals were also made in respect of the crisis management framework 
and cross
-border integration. 
These
 involved
, among other
 thing
s, 
harmonising elements of insolvency law, formalising support arrangements 
within EU banking groups (i.e. 
establishing 
a formal 
mechanism 
for 
subsidiaries
™ support by their parents
), phasing out options and national discretions
 that had 
ceased to be justified
, reviewing the governance of the SRB and facilitating cross
 -border banking.
 These measures 
should
 ensure that bank f
ailures can be 
tackled effectively and without bailouts
, preserving a level playing field and 
ensuring financial stability.
 It was also suggested that f
inancial integration should 
be strengthened by rolling back prudential and non
-prudential 
obstacles
 to 
cross
-border 
banking between Member States.
 There was broad recognition at that Eurogroup meeting that the High
-Level 
Working Group™s report contained important proposals for the strengthening of 
EMU.
 The 
High
-Level Working Group and the Eurogroup Working G
roup have
 been 
asked to 
continue working on all elements
. Further work will also be 
carried out
 by the 
institutions and the 
relevant
 Council working parties
. Work will also continue in the relevant European fora on the provision of 
liquidity to banks in re
solution.
 When failing banks go into resolution, viable parts 
can be resolved and restructured, re
-entering the marketplace either as a stand 
-alone 
entity or as part of a larger banking group. During this transition phase, they may 
temporarily lack access
 to the market liquidity that they need in order to successfully 
reinitiate their operations. This is why other jurisdictions (such as the United Kingdom 
and the United States) have established public systems that provide liquidity to banks 
in resolution. 
Although they vary in terms of their precise design, these systems 
generally rely on central bank liquidity, underpinned by fiscal guarantees. No such 
functionality exists at euro area level, implying a de facto fallback onto national 
solutions.
 National
 solutions, however, do not reflect the reality that large euro are
a banks 
are now supervised at European level, creating a mismatch between liability 
and control.
 Moreover, national solutions risk 
fuelling the
 bank
-sovereign nexus, as 
fiscal authorities may
 have to backstop bank
s™ liquidity needs

guarantees.

that the Eurosystem can only provide liquidity against adequate

 The Council and the European Parliament are expected to continue working on 
legislative 
initiatives relating to the banking union and banking regulation more 
broadly
. This will include proposals made in the previous legislative period which have 
not yet come to fruition (such as a number of regulations/directives relating to 
collateral and th

new initiatives and reviews of existing legislation (including the implementation of 
Basel III and aspects of the single rulebook relating to capital requirements and

115 2.2
 Capital markets union
 The Five Presidents™ Report also called for further development of the CMU.
 The 
idea here is that well
-functioning capital markets can strengthen cross
-border risk 
sharing through deeper integration of bond and equity markets. An inc
rease in private 
risk sharing and greater integration of markets can also provide a buffer against 
systemic shocks in the financial sector. In addition, companies 
Œ including small and 
medium
-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
Œ will have access to a mo
re divers
e range of 
finance
, in addition to bank credit.
 The goals of the CMU project
, as defined in the Commission
™s 2015
 action 
plan
,116 are manifold
, with 
the overarching aim 
being 
to create ﬁstronger capital 
marketsﬂ in the EU.
 The CMU project 
originally stemmed, in 
essence,
 from the 
observation that, 
relative
 to other 
monetary unions
, the euro area ha
d less 
well 
developed and
 less
 integrated capital markets
, which were preventing it from enjoying 
a number of economic benefits
. A fully
 fledged CMU 
(which
, in combinati
on with 
the 
banking union
, could lay the 
foundations
 for a financial union
) would ﬁhelp mobilise 
capital in Europe and channel it to all companiesﬂ, as well as ﬁdeepen financial 
integrationﬂ through ﬁmore cross
-border risk sharing, more liquid markets and 
diversified sources of fundingﬂ
.117 In its response to the Commission™s 2015 
green 
paper,118 the Eurosystem noted that ﬁCMU has the potential to complement the 
banking union, strengthen Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and deepen the 
Single Marketﬂ. 
Outside o
bservers such as the IMF make similar arguments.

 The state of play regarding the deepenin

  106 Most of the proposals listed in the 2015 
action 
plan 
were implemented
 in the 
last
 legislative 
period, 
but more remains to be done
. For example, l
ittle progress 
has been 
made
 on key 
issues
 such as taxation a
nd the harmonisation of insolvency 
frameworks. 
Specifically, reforms aimed at removing biases in the tax code that favour 
debt over equity remain unfinished, and the withholding tax on capital gains remains 
heterogeneous across the euro area. On the subjec
t of insolvency frameworks, there 
is still no alignment as regards the question of how to recoup collateral or assign the 
claims of creditors. I
n other 
areas
, meanwhile, 
the initial level of ambition 
has 
been 
lowered significantly
. This is true, for 
example, of
 the review of the ESAs
 (particularly 
as regards the competences of the 
European Securities and Markets Authority)
, the 
supervision of 
central 
counterparties as laid down in the European Market 
Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR 2.2) and the 
establ
ishment
 of a 
Pan-European 
Pension Product. 
While measures in some areas may simply need more time in order 
to achieve their full effect, it seems unlikely that t
he 
original
 2015 action 
plan 
will, on its 
own,
 be sufficient to
 achieve

the

 Strengthening the EU™s capital markets will become even more important after

 The state of play regarding the deepening agenda for Economic and Monetary Union
  107 needed.
 A fragmented framework for third
-country access, relying on a patchwork of 
existing national regimes, could give rise to regulatory arbitrage
, with
 firms 
potentially
 seek
ing
 to circumvent host supervision and EU regulatory requirements. Appropriate 
oversight 
will be needed, with
 EU regulators and supervisors
 being given adequate 
tools
, especially considering that existing third
-country regimes were n
ot 
designed
 to 
manage substantial cross
-border provision of services.
 Measures aimed at developing capital markets would help to str
engthen the
 EU™s domestic capacity in areas where reliance on London is more 
pronounced.
 A substantial reduction 
in the
 prov
ision of cross
-border services 
by the 
City of London would strengthen the case for developing domestic capacity. CMU 
initiatives have been 
launched in order
 to support the development of certain market 
segments
, such as securitisation and crowdfunding. The
 CMU 
project 
also 
seeks
 to 
increase the use of equity financing 
through
 its role in supporting investment and 
private risk sharing. 
Thus, in a post
-Brexit world, 
initiatives fostering the development 
of genuine capital markets 
will be even more important
. The Commission has initiated further work 
on the CMU 
with a view to 
presenting legislative proposals in 2020.
 The
 High
-Level 
Forum established by the 
Commission 
has been
 tasked with putting forward proposals for the next CMU 
action 
plan by the end of May 2
020. 
The High
-Level 
Forum is exploring three 
questions
: (i)
 how to create an ecosystem 
that allows
 greater cross
-border 
raising of 
capital, with a 
particular
 focus on innovative SMEs
; (ii) how to 
establish
 pan -European capital 
market architecture, with 
a particular
 focus on 
the question of 
how new financial 
technologies can support this process
;120 and (iii) how investment choices and access 
to capital market services can 
foster
 greater 
participation by 
retail investors.
 The Council 
is also looking at issues
 in this area
. In October 2019, a
 high
-level 
working 
group 
established
 by 
a number of
 Member States
 published 
proposals 
aimed 
at relaunching 
the 
CMU
. These
 include
d recommendations 
aimed at
 generating 
long
-term savings opportunities, developing equity mark
ets, enhancing cross
-border 
financial flows
, and developing debt, credit and forex financing tools. 
The conclusions 
of the December 2019 ECOFIN meeting call for a roadmap to be drawn up for the 
deepening of the CMU on the basis of six objectives: (i) enhan
ced access to finance 
for EU firms (especially SMEs); (ii) the removal of structural and legal barriers to 
increased cross
-border capital flows; (iii) the provision of incentives encouraging 
well
-informed retail savers to invest, and the removal of obstacl
es standing in their 
way; (iv) support for transition to sustainable economies; (v) the embracing of 
technological progress and digitalisation; and (vi) strengthening of the global 
competitiveness of EU capital markets.
121 Those conclusions invite the Commis
sion 
to assess and explore detailed measures and actions that could help to achieve these 
objectives.
 While there is broad acknowledgement of the importance of the CMU, the 
challenge will be to transform that ambition
 into concrete and ambitious

 2.3
 Fiscal instruments for the euro area
 In the realm of fiscal union, the Five Presidents™ Report called for the 
establishment of 
a euro area
-wide fiscal stabilisation
 function 
for severe crisis 
situations.
 In such circumstances, n
ational 
fiscal buffers may
 not be 
able
 to provide 
the degree of 
economic stabilisation
 that would be optimal from an aggregate 
euro 
area
 perspective
. Mature 
monetary unions typically have 
a common macroeconomic 
stabilisation function 
in order 
to enhance the economy™s resilience to shocks 
that 
cannot be managed at nation
al level alone.
 Discussions on 
the 
establish
ment
 and
 expan
sion of
 European fiscal 
instruments are 
currently ongoing,
 with three types of goal 
in mind: 
(i)
 stabilisation
 of the business cycle,
 (ii) 
fostering of 
convergence 
through 
support for
 structural ref
orm
s and (iii) 
increases in 
public investment.
 In 
addition, negotiations have also been taking place with regard to the reforming of the 
euro area™s crisis architecture (particularly the ESM) and the EU™s next multiannual 
financial framework (covering the 
period 2021
-27) 
Œ issues which are not covered in 
great detail here. For an overview of concluded and ongoing work streams in this area,

 In its 
opinion on the

function
 (EISF)
, the ECB welcomed the 
fact 
that
 the
 creation of a common 
macroeconomic stabilisation function for the euro area
 was being discussed
.122 The ECB pointed out that 
other
 monetary unions 
have such functions in order 
to better 
deal with economic shocks that cannot be managed at national le
vel. If designed
 appropriately
, a common macroeconomic stabilisation function would increase the 
economic resilience of 
both 
individual participating Member States and the euro area

ly in the 
presence of deep euro area
-wide recessions.
 Thus far, little progress has been made on the establishment of 
a genuine 
stabilisation function
. In addition to
 the Commission™s 2018 proposal for a
n EISF
,123 prominent proposals ranging from ﬁrainy day 
fundsﬂ to investment protection schemes 
and unemployment (re)insurance schemes have been made by international 
institutions, academics and a number of Member States.
124 Those proposals have been 
discussed in EU fora, which are continuing to work on them, but
 only at a technical level. 
Meanwhile, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has indicated that she intends 
to propose a European unemployment benefit reinsurance scheme. At this stage, 
however, there is no concrete information on the possible design o
f such a scheme.
125 Rather than 
a stabilisation
 function
, it has been agreed, as 
a compromise
, that
 a budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness 
will be created in 
order to
 provide EU funds to Member States for structural reforms and 
investment
. In its agreement of 10 October 2019
, the Eurogroup 
set
 out the main 
features of the BICC, including key governance principles 
and 
financing modalities
, as 
well as core parameters for the allocation of funds.
126 Funds will be allocated to each 
Member State 
on the 
basis of its 
population and the inverse of 
its gross national 
income (GNI)
 per capita
, with a ﬁjuste retourﬂ floor of 70%. 
(In other words, Member 
States can never receive less than 70% of the funds that they 
have paid in
.) As 
regard
s national co
-financing rates, the agreement foresees a rate of 25%, while a 
modulation procedure envisages that this rate can be cut 
in half in 
the presence
 of 
severe economic circumstances.
127 The main outstanding issue
s relat
ing
 to the BICC 
concern
 its siz
e and financing. 
As regards
 the 
amount
 of funding 
to be provided 
from 
the EU budget, the Eurogroup and 
the 
Commission had proposed a 
sum
 of •17
 billion, 
but 
in December 
the Finnish EU Presidency 
proposed
 a substantially lower amount of 
•12.9
 billion
 as par
t of the negotiation of the multiannual financial framework
. On 
the 
subject of 
financing, the Eurogroup Working Group
 has been
 tasked 
with
 carrying out 
further discuss
ions in 2020 on
 an 
intergovernmental 
agreement (IGA) that could 
funnel additional resourc
es into the BICC.
 This 
has 
resulted in a dedicated report 
providing further information on the rationale for the IGA and its content, modalities 
and scope
.128 A final decision
 Œ including 
a decision 
on the IGA
 Œ will be taken by 
                                        
                           
 123. The Commission has also made propos
als on convergence and public investment in the form of a plan 
for a Reform Support Programme and a proposal to turn the European Fund for Strategic Investments 
(the ﬁJuncker Planﬂ) into InvestEU (see

 126. See the 
Eurogroup term sheet on the budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness
. 127. A national co
-financing rate of 25% means that a quarter of the costs of a particular project are borne by 
the 
receiving Member State, while the remaining 75% are financed via the EU budget. The degree of 
co-financing required to receive EU funds may temporarily be reduced by half in the presence of severe 
economic circumstances, as defined in the Stability and Gro
wth Pact. Such cyclical modulation can occur 
in the event of a negative annual GDP volume growth rate or if a country experiences an accumulated 
loss of output (see Article 2 of 
Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97
). 128  See the

 Europe™s 
leaders in the conte

 Given 
that 
it is currently 
expected to be fairly
 limited 
in terms of capacity
, the BICC will 
probably
 not 
have
 a material impact on 
the 
convergence, competitiveness or stabilisation
 of the 
euro area.
 Equipping the BICC 
with additional resources via 
an IGA 
will therefore be essential in 
order to increase its effectiveness.
 At the same time, over the 
last 
few 
years, 
a number of
 budgetary instruments 
aimed at supporting investment have been developed and scaled up at EU28
 Œ rather than euro area
 Œ level.
 In 2014, the European Commission launched its 
Investment Plan for Europe (the ﬁJuncker Planﬂ) as a collective fiscal instrument at EU 
level in order to reverse the downward trend in investment and help sustain the 
economic r
ecovery. By October 2019, the Investment Plan for Europe had triggered 
•439.4 billion in additional investment across the EU. Indeed, according to the 
Commission, investment under this programme had increased EU GDP by 0.9% by 
2019 and will increase it by 
a cumulative total of 1.8% by 2022. The European 
Investment Bank (EIB) is another budgetary instrument that exists at EU level. In 2012, 
the EIB™s capital was increased further (bringing its subscribed capital to •232.4 billion) 
with the aim of contributin
g to economic growth in Europe. That increase in capital has 
allowed the EIB to provide about •60 billion in additional lending over a three
-year 
period, thereby further increasing the macroeconomic impact of its operations.
 Looking 
ahead
, there are severa
l proposals aimed at increasing the EU™s 
support 
for
 investment
 which
 may
 have 
a beneficial macroeconomic 
impact
 at 
euro area level, al
bei
t they 
do not 
seek to achieve
 countercyclical
 effects
 and 
are limited in size.
 In the Commission
™s proposal for the 20
21-27 multiannual 
financial 
framework, the 
largest 
relative increase in the EU budget 
can be seen
 in the 
area of support for investment. The InvestEU 
programme proposed for the next MFF 
is expected to 
place
 the European Fund for Strategic Investments and 1
3 other EU 
financial instruments under 
a single
 roof
, mobilising at least •650 billion in additional 
investment.
129 Moreover, the Sustainable Investment Plan announced by the new 
Commission is expected to trigger •1 trillion 
in climate
-related investment 
between 
2020 and 
2030. The Commission table
d a proposal 
on this issue 
on 8
 January 2020.
 The 
establishment of a
 central 
fiscal capacity could
 involve
 the issuance of
 some form of safe asset
 at euro area level
. In this context, the 
General Board of the 
European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) 
set up
 a High
-Level Task Force on Safe 
Assets
, which 
investigate
d the practical considerations relating to sovereign bond
 -backed securities (SBBS
s).130 At present, h
owever, 
no specific
 proposals on eu
ro 
area safe assets are

ed in EU fora at political level.
 A discussion on re
orienting
 EU policies
 Œ including the EU budget
 Œ towards 
the provision of public goods such as environmental protection, digitalisation 
and security is gaining tracti
on.

 2.4
 Governance of national fisc
al and economic policies
 In the realm of 
fiscal 
and economic u
nion, the 
Five Presidents™ Report
 called for 
stronger coordination of national policies under both the Stability and Growth 
Pact and the MIP
. On the subject of fiscal policies,
 that report 
emphasised the need 
for responsible budgetary policies at Member State level
. A review of the 
six-pack and 
two-pack 
Œ a related consultation process was launched by the Commission on 5 
February
132 Œ was identified as an
 opportunity to 
increase 
clarity, trans
parency, 
compliance and l
egitimacy, while preserving the
 stability
 -oriented nature
 of the fiscal 
rules
. Better compliance with fiscal rules was to be achieved via the establishment
 of 
the
 European Fiscal Board
 (EFB), which would
 coordinate and complement 
national 
fiscal councils
 and provide an independent assessment of Member States™ compliance 
with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. As regards economic policies, the Five 
Presidents™ Report emphasised the need for further economic convergence in o
rder to 
achieve 
consistently
 resilient economic structures throughout the euro area.
 A network
 of 
competitiveness 
authorities
 (ﬁnational productivity boardsﬂ) was envisaged for the 
euro area in order
 to 
track performance in the field of competitiveness
, prevent 
economic divergence and increase ownership of the necessary reforms at national 
level
. Moreover, the Five Presidents™ Report also called for stronger surveillance under 
the MIP to encourage structural reforms and better capture imbalances at the leve
l of 
the euro area as a whole. Meanwhile, the European Semester was to place greater 
emphasis on the coordination of economic policies.
 An effective coordination system 
for
 national economic policies is essential for 
the
 smooth functioning of EMU
. This
 is 
of 
vital 
importance in order 
to support the 
single monetary policy and bolster economic convergence 
both 
within and 
across
 countries.
 The fiscal and economic governance 
framework in
 EMU 
has been
 reformed
 over the years, drawing on lessons learned both before and during the crisis
. The six
-pack reform of 2011 and the two
-pack reform of 2013 
sought to place
 greater 
emphasis
 on debt
133 and expenditure control, strengthening enforcement, 
improving 
the
 monitorin
g of 
macroeconomic imbalances and establishing independent fiscal 
institutions at national level. Since then, EU fiscal rules have been subject to 
continuous refinement and interpretative innovation, which 
has 
resulted in greater 
complexity and 
increased t
he scope
 for 
discretion
. The EFB and 
national 
productivity 
boards 
have also been
 established.
 The Five Presidents™ Report, which called for the 
creation of the EFB, anticipated that it would act as an 
advisory 
body,
 coordinat
ing
 and

 However, t
he reform of the 
Stability and Growth Pact
 has had
 mixed results
. Overall, the debt and deficit levels of the euro area as a whole are below those seen in 
other 
major advanced economies. There are no ongoing excessive deficit procedures 
(EDPs) at present, and many euro area countries have now reached their medium
-term 
budgetary objectives (MTOs).
136 At the same time, some countries have made 
insufficient progress in
 terms of reducing government debt and deficits.
137 There are 
currently limited fiscal buffers available to support growth if downside risks to the current 
economic outlook materialise, particularly in high
-debt countries. In addition to criticism 
of their l
imited effect as a disciplining device, the EFB and others have also pointed out 
that the rules have become too complex and overly reliant on unobservable variables 
such as output gaps. Moreover, the Stability and Growth Pact does not contain rules or 
inst
ruments aimed at steering the aggregate euro area fiscal stance, and little effort has 
been made to improve the quality of public finances, irrespective of the fiscal stance.

 As regards structural policies, continued weak 
implementation of 
country
 -specif
ic recommendation
s (CSR
s) by Member States
 Œ including those with 
excessive imbalances
 Œ remains a challenge for the European Semester.
139 Indeed, in February 2019 the Commission concluded that none of the 2018 CSRs for 
euro area countries had been ﬁfullyﬂ i
mplemented.
140 Meanwhile, ﬁsubstantialﬂ progress 
was only observed for around 5% of CSRs. This was similar to the situation seen in 
previous years. As such, the streamlining of the European Semester (by reducing the 
number of CSRs) and the enhancement of the
 dialogue between the Commission and 
Member States have not yielded the intended improvements. Moreover, countries with 
excessive imbalances do not seem to have taken further decisive policy action to step 
up the implementation of their CSRs. Finally, the 
macroeconomic imbalance procedure 
has not yet been applied in full, as the Commission has never exercised its right to 
initiate an excessive imbalance procedure (EIP).
141 The Commission 
is now in the process of reviewing both the six
-pack and the 
two
-pack, w
ith that review due to be concluded 
in 2020.
142 That review, which 
was launched on 5 February, will take account of f
our key weaknesses 
in the fiscal 
framework
: (i) the 
high 
levels of 
debt in some Member States; (
ii) the 
procyclical
 nature 
of fiscal policies
; (iii
) the 
complex
ity of
 rules and 
the 
lack of ownership; 
and 
(iv) the fact 
that 
insufficient attention 
is paid 
to investment. 
The Commission 
has also 
launched a 
consultation process, inviting stakeholders 
(including the ECB
) to provide their views 
on 
the question of 
how the economic governance framework has functioned so far and 
how best to
 enhanc
e its effectiveness
. That consultation process will run until the 
summer, and
 the Commission w
ill
 then take all 
responses
 into consideration when it 
reflect
s internally on possible next steps in the second half of the year.
 A number
 of 
possible ways of
 rectifying
 the EU
™s fiscal governance framework 
have been put forward 
by stakeholders.
 In 2017, 
for instance, 
the Commission 
proposed 
amending
 the Treaty on Stab
ility, Coordination and Governance (
the ﬁf
iscal 
compact
ﬂ) and integrating it 
into the 
EU™s legal framework.
143 Meanwhile
, the IMF
,144 the EFB
145 and ECB staff
146 have all 
advocated reform
ing
 the 
Stability and Growth 
Pact 
on the
 bas
is of a single
 long
-run debt target and 
a single operational instrument 
(such as an expenditure rule).
 The EFB 
has 
called for a 
wide
-ranging
 revi
ew aimed at
 simplifying the rules
, combined
 with progress 
towards the establishment of
 a

147 Most observ
ers also see a link between further risk
 sharing 
and market discipline.
 On 
the subject of 
reforming the European Semester and the MIP, no major 
proposals have been tabled
, other than the BICC.
 The Commission has
, however, 
indicated that
 it inten
ds to integ
rate the UN Sustainable Development Goals
 into the 
European Semester, as well as
 possibly replac
ing
 the EU2020 
Agenda (which serves 
as 
an 
anchor for the 
European 
Semester) with the 
UN™s 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development.
 At the same time, in the cont
ext of growing concerns about global competition, 
digitalisation and climate change, the Single Market 
is set to feature more
 prominen
tly
 in the Commission™s agenda going forward.
 Ambitious policy 
agendas in these three 
areas
 have the potential to
 open 
up 
new sources of growth and 
play an important role in accelerating convergence within EMU
, which historically grew 
out of the Single Market
. Services,
 for example,
 remain underdeveloped and could 
help to bring about
 more integrated and resilient product mark
ets.
148 149 The 
Commission has also launched a Green New Deal, which is expected to mobilise 
additional investment in order to finance the transition process.
 2.5
 Crisis management
 The establishment of a fiscal backstop 
for the 
euro area in the form of the 
Eur
opean Stability Mechanism was of fundamental importance for the 
resilience of EMU.
 In response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, euro area 
countries
 established the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) in 2010. This 
was followed 
in 2012 
by the establishment of the ESM as a permanent euro area crisis 
management body outside the 
EU™s legal framework. Together, the EFSF and the 
ESM 
have 
disbursed •295 billion in financial assistance since 2010.
 Over the 
last two years, euro area 
countries ha
ve been
 negotiat
ing
 a reform of 
the ESM 
in order 
to increase its operational capacity.
 In December 2019, the 
Eurogroup agreed in principle on four broad reforms
, which will
 be reflected in a 
revised ESM Treaty. First, the ESM will 
act as a 
backstop 
for
 the
 Single Resolution 
Fund. Second, the ESM will play a more prominent role in the design and monitoring of 
conditionality 
requirements in
 macroeconomic adjustment programmes, as well as 
external
 programmes. Third, the conditions for accessing 
the 
ESM™s preca
utionary 
support will be 
set out more clearly
. And f
ourth, the framework for assessing 
the
 sustainability 
of debt 
will be refined further
, and single
-limb collective action clauses 
                                        
                           
 147. The EFB has, however, noted that Member States do not regard the current practices as sufficiently 
dest
abilising to make such a review a high priority

 Other institutional issues (

accompanied by greater economic integration.
 Spe
cifically, greater responsibility 
at EU and euro area level 
needs to
 go hand
 in hand with 
ﬁgreat
er democratic 
accountability, legitimacy and institutional strengtheningﬂ
.151 As regards
 these 
broader institutional reforms, a number of initiatives 
proposed in 
the Five Presidents
™ Report have yet 
to 
materialise
 (see Table 5 for 
an overview)
. These initiatives include, for example, more unified external 
representation of the euro area and 
the establishment of 
a euro area treasury. 
Meanwhile, o
thers have called fo
r clearer separation 
between
 the prosecut
ion and 
adjud
icatory roles
 within the Commission, 
in order 
to strengthen its ability to act as the 
guardian of the Treaty in enforcing the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, the ESM 
and the fiscal compact have not
 yet been integrated into EU law. While the 
Commission put forward proposals
 in these areas
, both co
-legislators eventually 
decided not to follow
 up on them. In a similar vein, the policy proposal presented by 
the Commission in 2017 
with a view 
to establis
hing
 a euro 
area 
treasury
152 met
 with 
strong scepticism
 in the Council,
 and the Commission never made a 
formal 
legislative 
proposal. These institutional 
reforms
 could potentially 
become
 more relevant 
when it 
comes to
 the institutional 
arrangements for
 any fu
ture fiscal capacity.

 and process for such

154 3 Conclusions
 The new European legislature will be able to build on the 
significant 
steps that 
were t
aken to improve 
EMU architecture
 in the previous decade
. The
 establishment of the European Stability Mechanism, the reform
ing
 of fiscal rules and 
the establishment of the 
macroeconomic 
imbalance 
procedure 
all helped to address 
fault lines exposed by the cr
isis. The subsequent i
ntroduction of the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism and 
the 
Single Resolution Mechanism
 then
 delivered two of 
the three
 pillars of the banking union.
 Nevertheless, 
the 
agenda that was proposed in the Five Presidents™ Report has 
yet to be 
fully implemented, with outstanding measures in
 the financial, fiscal, 
economic and political 
domains
. There is no room for complacency 
when it comes 
to mak
ing
 EMU 
better able to withstand
 adverse shocks
. Private and public debt 
remain elevated in many cou
ntries, private and public risk
 sharing 
are still more limited
 in the euro area than 
they are 
in other monetary unions
, and mechanisms 
aimed at
 ensur
ing
 resilient policies at national level could be strengthened
 further
. The first priority is the need to 
complete the b
anking 
union.
 An unfinished 
banking union
 will prevent
 the euro area and its citizens 
from
 reap
ing
 the full benefits 
when it comes to market integration and the uniform 
protection
 of deposit
ors. There is, 
however, some momentum in th
is regard
, which should be seized 
upon in order 
to 
pursue a package of 
measures
 in parallel:
  Establish a European Deposit Insurance Scheme: The
 establishment of a
 fully
 fledged EDIS
 should be the key priority
, as 
it is the
 main element that is
 missing 
in 
terms of
 completing 
the b
anking 
union.
 In the short to medium term, 
a common 
deposit 
insurance 
scheme 
could be set up
 on the basis of a hybrid model
, relying 
on existing national schemes and a central fund
, with loss coverage gradual
ly increas
ing
 over the next five 
years. 
However, the end goal should be an
 EDIS 
with full loss
 and liquidity
 coverage
, in order 
to ensure uniform protection of 
covered deposits.

  Harmonise national bank insolvency procedures at European level: Bank
 insolvency frameworks 
continue to vary ac
ross countries,
 potentially giving rise
 to very 
significant 
differen
ces in 
terms of
 outcomes. Taking the US Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as a model, a harmonised liquidation 
framework should be established
, and the Single Resolution Board should be 
given
 the tools 
needed 
to oversee the orderly liquidation of banks 
(especially 
in 
the case o
f small and medium
-sized 
banks
 which are not subject to resolution
).  Remove impediments to the free flow of capital and l
iquidity: In order to protect 
domestic bank balance sheets against adverse shocks, capital and
 liquidity
 should be allowed to flow freely within EMU
 (including
 within cross
 -border 
banking groups
). Striking a balance between the interests 
of financial inte
gration 
and financial stability will be crucial 
in order 
to 
remove
 those impediments within 
the 
euro area
.  Recognise that the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures and the 
development of a common euro area safe asset can be two additional mutually 
supportive aspects of the deepening of EMU
: Work on
 a sound and prudent 
design 
for
 each concept should continue independently. The introduction of 
RTSE needs to take into account financial stability considerations and 
reinforces 
the case for ensuring 
 suffic
ient availability of safe assets for 
the 
liquidity and risk 
management of financial institutions. At the same time, the creation of a common 
euro area safe asset, if so decided by Member States, should be pursued in a 
way that does not undermine incentives
 for sound national fiscal policies. Th
at common safe asset will also be conducive to the smooth conduct of monetary 
policy
. Together with RTSE, it 
will 
also contribute to the safety and soundness of 
banks
, as well as
 contributing 
indirectly to
 the
 strengt
hening of the international 
role of the euro.
  Close the gap in terms of the provision of liquidity to banks in resolution
: A European
-level guarantee promising access to Eurosystem liquidity for banks
 in 
resolution would bring the euro area in
to line with 
other major jurisdictions such 
as the U
nited 
Kingdom
 and the U
nited 
States
.  Improve Europe™s anti
-money laundering (AML) framework:
 The existing AML
 Directive should be 
turned
 into a regulation
, establish
ing
 an effective European 
toolkit combat
ing
 money la
undering. An EU body outside the ECB should be 
given responsibility for
 AML tasks and could be equipped with direct supervisory 
powers.
 A second
 priority is 
the development of a
 European capital market, which is
 vital in order to
 improve private risk
 sharing 
and is an area that remains
 underdeveloped
. The European Commission and 
its
 High
-Level 
Forum 
looking at
 the 
CMU 
are expected to make proposals on this issue 
in early 2020. 
Those proposals will

application across the 
EU.  Harmonising products and standards: 
Capital market products and
 standards 
should be harmonised, 
with
 a Pan-European Pension Product and 
common
 standards for
 securitisation,
 fintech and green bond
s, for example.
  Convergence of framework conditions: 
In order to create a landscape
 conducive to vibrant capital markets, the EU 
requires
 greater 
convergence of 
framework conditions with 
a bearing on 
the 
CMU, such as tax and insolvency 
frameworks.
 A third
 priority is 
the need 
to improve the euro area
™s fiscal architecture, which 
has not 
entirely
 delivered as intended.
 The 
current 
fiscal rules d
o not do enough to 
ensure 
the
 achievement of sound 
and sustainable 
fiscal positions in economic good 
times. 
The 
resulting 
lack of fiscal space 
in bad times may then entail a need for 
procyclical fiscal tightening
, which may render the 
macroeconomic policy mix
 inappropriate at the euro area level
. Going forward, there is therefore 
a need for the 
following:
  Reforms to
 fiscal rules to make them simpler, more effective and less 
procyclical: 
There is a fairly broadly based consensus in both academia and 
policy institutions
 that it would be beneficial 
to move towards a framework with a 
single indicator 
(e.g.
 an expenditure
 rule
) with links to a debt anchor. 
The ongoing 
review of the two
-pack and the six
-pack represents an opportunity to reassess 
the effectiveness of the SGP framework.
  Creation of a central fiscal capacity for the euro area for the purposes of 
macroeconomic 
stabilisation: 
The existing rules are not conducive to the 
establishment of a euro area
-wide fiscal
 policy stance that could complement 
monetary policy, particular
ly at the 
effective 
lower bound. 
A central budgetary 
function 
of this kind would help to incr
ease the euro area™s resilience when facing 
severe economic crises
. A fourth priority is the need to improve 
the resilience of national 
economic 
structures
. The 
implementation of structural reforms to increase the resilience of 
labour and product markets
, as well as institutions
, has 
waned
 in recent years. T
wo 
different avenues can be leveraged in order to address 
this:
  Use the macroeconomic imbalance procedure more effectively: Existing
 means of 
coordinating 
economic policy 
Œ including the 
excessive 
imbalance 
procedure 
Œ should be applied more effectively.
  Deepen the Single Market: Europe
 is increasingly shifting from the production
 of goods to 
the 
provi
sion of
 services
 Œ an area where the Single Market is 
not as 
well
 developed 
(partly as a result of 
shortcomings in terms of
 the implementation 
of the Services Directive
). Consequently
, there are still 
many 
national regulations 
governing
 the delivery of different types of 
service in the various Member States. 
With that in mind
, the Commission should 
plac
e renewed emphasis on
 initiatives 
aimed at deepening the Single Market
, reaping the benefits of
 its proven track

 record of boosting economic growth. In parallel, it could explore 
the possibility of
 broaden
ing
 the scope of the Single Market in areas where r
eform efforts have 
lost momentum
 (e.g. as regards
 conditions for doing business
). Progress in these outstanding areas will
 support the effectiveness of the single 
monetary policy and banking supervision
 and help to preserve financial 
stability
. Sound count
ercyclical fiscal policies,
 completion of the banking union,
 sufficient financial resilience and cross
-border private and public risk sharing are 
all 
important to
 the ECB 
in order 
to allow for more effective transmission of monetary 
policy with fewer side 
effects, enhance the alignment of euro area business cycles, 
complement monetary policy
, give
 European
 banking supervision
 greater 
traction
 and 
safeguard financial stability
