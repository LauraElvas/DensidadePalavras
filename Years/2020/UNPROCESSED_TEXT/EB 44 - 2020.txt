 1 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 
4 June
, the Governing Council decided
 to 
increase the envelope
 and extend the horizon
 for 
the pandemic 
emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP)
 and to
 reinvest 
its
 matur
ing principal payments
, while c
ontinu
ing
 with 
the
 asset purchase p
rogramme
 (APP)
 and its 
reinvestments
 and keep
ing
 the key ECB interest rates unchanged
. Incoming 
information confirms that the eur
o area economy is experiencing an unprecedented 
contraction. There has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic and the measures to contain it. Severe job and 
income losses and exceptionally elevated uncer
tainty about the economic outlook 
have led to a significant fall in consumer spending and investment. While survey data 
and real
-time indicators for economic activity have shown some signs of a 
bottoming
-out alongside the gradual easing of the containment 
measures, the 
improvement has so far been tepid compared with the speed at which the indicators 
plummeted in the preceding two months. The June 
2020 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections 
for the euro area 
see growth declining at an 
unprecedented pace 
in the second quarter of this year, before rebounding again in the 
second half, crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy. 
Nonetheless, the projections entail a substantial downward revision to both the level of 
economic acti
vity and the inflation outlook over the whole projection horizon, though 
the baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. While headline 
inflation is suppressed by lower energy prices, price pressures are expected to remain 
subdued on ac
count of the sharp decline in real GDP and the associated significant 
increase in economic slack.
 Against this background, 
the Governing Council
 decided 
on a set of monetary policy measures to support the economy during its gradual 
reopening and to safeguard medium
-term price stability.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
4 June
 2020 The COVID
-19 epidem
ic 
has caused 
a sharp deterioration in the global outlook
, as embedded in the 
June
 2020 Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections.
 The
 COVID
-19 pandemic h
as paralysed the global economy, with m
easures to contain 
the spread of the virus taken by government
s across the globe 
being a
 driving
 factor 
behind the recent sharp decline in economic activity. Several countries have recently 
started easing containment measures, but this process is likely to be very gradual. 
Economic activity, especially in emerging ma
rket economies, has also been adversely 
affected by a sharp fall in commodity prices, tighter financial conditions and substantial 
capital outflows. 
Incoming
 data confirm that the economic fallout from containment 
measures will be sharp and deep. In view o
f these severe global disruptions, the June 
2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections envisage that world real GDP

  3 (excluding the euro area) will contract by 4.0% this year. The pace of this contraction is 
faster and its magnitude greater than seen i
n the Great Recession. Following a sharp 
contraction in the first two quarters of 2020, global activity is projected to start t
o recover in the third quarter and
 to increase by 6.0% and 3.9% in 2021 and 2022
, respectively. Global trade will be affected mor
e severely, as logistics disruptions and 
closed borders amplify the impact of the fallout. Despite a sharp deterioration in the 
global outlook, as embedded in the June projections, risks to this outlook are still 
skewed to the downside. Most importantly, t
he impact of the pandemic may prove to 
be stronger and longer l
asting than currently expected.
 Although financial conditions in the euro area have loosened somewhat since 
the Governing Council™s meeting in March 2020, they have not returned to the 
levels s
een before the global spread of 
COVID
-19. Over the review period (12 
March 2020 to 3 June 2020) the forward curve of the euro overnight index average 
(EONIA) shifted upwards. Its inversion at short maturities is still present, albeit less so 
than on 12 March, 
signalling 
that market participants™ e
xpectations of further policy 
rate cuts have diminished and shifted further out into the future. Despite the monetary 
policy accommodation provided via the PEPP and other policy measures, long
-term 
euro area sovereign bond yields increased over the review 
period. Prices of risk
y assets partly recovered from the losses incurred during February and March, mainly 
against the backdrop of an improvement in global risk sentiment and the perception 
that tail risks of an imminent global crisis have faded to some ex
tent. In foreign 
exchange markets, the euro remained broadly stable in trade
-weighted terms, with 
volatility in bilateral exchange rates reflecting uncertainty 
surrounding
 the COVID
-19 pandemic.
 Euro area real GDP 
decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter, in 
the first quarter of 
2020, and incoming data point to 
a further significant contraction of real GDP in 
the second quarter
. The
 latest economic indicators and survey results confirm a 
sharp contraction of the euro area economy and rapidly deteriorating labo
ur market 
conditions. The coronavirus pandemic and the necessary containment measures 
have severely affected both the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on 
the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. Most 
recent 
indicators suggest some bottoming
-out of the downturn in May as parts of the 
economy gradually reopen. Accordingly, euro area activity is expected to rebound in 
the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by 
favourable financ
ing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in 
global activity, although the overall speed and scale of the re
bound remains highly 
uncertain.
 This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic proje
ctions for the euro area.
 In the baseline scenario of the 
projections, annual real GDP is expected to fall by 8.7% in 2020 and to rebound by 
5.2% in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections, the outlook for re
al GDP growth has been revised 
substantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 
percentage points in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022.
 Given the exceptional 
uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the project

 Overview
  4 alternative scenarios
.1 In general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will 
depend crucially on the duration and effectiveness of the containment measures, the 
success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes 
and employment, and 
the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected. 
Overall, the Governing Council sees the balance of risks around the basel
ine 
projection 
tilted 
to the downside.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, eu
ro area annual HICP inflation 
decreased to 0.1% in May, down from 0.3% in April, mainly on account of lower 
energy price inflation
. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil, headline 
inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming
 months and to remain 
subdued until the end of the year. Over the medium term, weaker demand will put 
downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures 
related to supply constraints. Market
-based indicators of longer
-term inflation 
expectations have remained at depressed levels. While survey
-based indicators of 
inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer
-term 
expect
ations have been less affected.
 This assessment is also reflected in the J
une 2020 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP 
inflation in the baseline scenario at 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022.
 Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outloo
k for 
HICP inflation has been revised downwards by 0.8 percentage points in 2020, 0.6 
percentage points in 2021 and 0.3 percentage points in 2022.
 Annual HICP inflation 
excluding energy and food is expected to be 0.8% in 2020, 0.7% in 2021 and 0.9% in 
2022. The COVID
-19 pandemic caused a sharp acceleration in monetary dynamics
, driven by acute liquidity needs of 
businesses
 to finance ongoing payment
s and 
strong preference
s for 
money holdings
 for precautionary reasons 
among
 economic agents.
 Broad
 money (M3) growth increased to 8.3% in April 2020, from 
7.5% in March. 
The s
trong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which is 
being 
driven to a larg
e extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. Moreover, high 
economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary 
reasons. The narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of 
money, continues to be
 the main contributor to broad money growth.
 Developments in 
loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on 
economic activity. The annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations rose 
further to 6.6% in Apr
il 2020, up from 5.5% in March, reflecting firms™ need to finance 
their ongoing expenditure and working capital in the context of rapidly declining 
revenues. 
At the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households decreased 
to 3.0% in April, from 3
.4% in March, amid consumption constraints due to the 
containment measures, declining confidence and a deteriorating labour market. 
The 
Governing Council™s
 policy measures, in particular the very favourable terms for 
the 
targeted longer
-term refinancing op
erations (TLTRO III), should encourage banks to 
extend loans to all private sector entities. Together with the measures adopted by

 Overview
  5 national governments and European institutions, 
the Governing Council™s measures 
support ongoing access to financing, includi
ng for those most affected by the 
ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The 
COVID
-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on fiscal policies in the 
euro area.
 Containment measures have also triggered unprecedented fiscal stimulus 
packages intended 
to cushion the economic fallout and to
 prepare for a swift recovery. 
As 
a result, the general government budget deficit in the euro area is projected to 
increase significantly
 in 2020
, to 8.5% of GDP, compared with 0.6% in 2019. Although 
the deficit ratio 
is expected to shrink to 4.9% in 2021, it is still expected to stand at 
3.8% of GDP in 2022. Overall the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is 
assessed to be strongly expansionary in 2020, but contractionary in 2021
, as most 
support measures are exp
ected 
to have been phased out by then
. Notwithstanding the 
negative fiscal stance in 2021, the overall fiscal balance will remain substantially 
negative with fiscal instruments continuing to support the economic recovery, not least 
through automatic stabil
isers.
 An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains 
critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy
, although measures 
should be targeted and temporary. In this respect, both the •540 billion package of 
three safety nets endorsed 
by the European Council and the European Commission™s 
proposal for a recovery plan dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors most 
severely hit by the pandemic are strongly welcomed.
 The m
onetary policy 
package
 A combination of 
two main factors called
 for ad
ditional monetary policy action. First, 
the 
pandemic
-related downward revision to the 
inflation outlook 
poses a threat to the 
Governing Council
™s medium
-term price stability mandate
. Second, 
while conditions in 
financial markets have stabilised subs
tantially since the PEPP announcement
, financial conditions 
for the euro area as a whole remain
 significantly tighter today 
than 
in 
the pre
-pandemic period, whereas the outlook for economic activity and inflation 
calls for easier financial conditions
. Against this background, 
on 4 June
 2020, the Governing Council decided on a 
set 
of 
monetary policy measures
 to support 
the 
ongoing 
ample degree of monetary 
accommodation necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are 
below, but close 
to, 2% over the medium term
, in line with its mandate.
 1. The Governing Council decided to increase the envelope for the PEPP by •600 
billion to a total of •1,350 billion. In response to the pandemic
-related downward 
revision to inflation over the projection 
horizon, the PEPP expansion will further 
ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the 
real economy, especially for businesses and households. The purchases will 
continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, acros
s asset classes 
and among jurisdictions. This allows 
the Governing Council 
to effectively stave 
off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
 2. The Governing Council
 decided to extend the horizon for net purchases under 
the PEPP to at least the en
d of June 2021. 
This broadly aligns the purchase

 Overview
  6 horizon with the horizons of 
the 
other monetary policy measures taken in 
response to the pandemic, such as TLTRO III and 
the pandemic emergency 
longer
-term refinancing operations (
PELTRO
s). In any case, 
the 
ECB 
will 
conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until the Governing Council judges 
that
 the coronavirus crisis phase is over.
 3. The Governing Council decided to reinvest the maturing principal payments from 
securities purchased under the PEPP until at le
ast the end of 2022. In any case, 
the future roll
-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with 
the appropriate monetary policy stance.
 The
 reinvestment
s will help to avoid
 the 
risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial condition
s while the economy is still 
recovering 
from the pandemic shock
. At the same time, it is appropriate that the 
reinvestment strategy for the PEPP reflects its temporary nature and link to the 
pandemic emergency.
 4. In addition,
 net purchases under 
the 
APP will
 continue at a monthly pace of •20 
billion, together with the purchases under the additional •120 billion temporary 
envelope until the end of the year. 
The Governing Council 
continue
s to expect 
monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long a
s necessary to 
reinforce the accommodative impact of 
the ECB™s 
policy rates, and to end shortly 
before 
the Governing Council starts 
raising the key ECB interest rates.
 5. The Governing C
ouncil 
intend
s to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal 
payments f
rom maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended 
period of time past the date when 
it 
start
s raising the key ECB interest rates, and 
in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions 
and an ample degree of mone
tary accommodation.
 6. Finally, t
he Governing Council decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged. 
These 
are expected to remain at their present or lower levels until 
the inflation outlook robustly converges to a level sufficiently close to, but 
below, 
2% within the projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently 
reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
 Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, 
the Governing 
Council™s
 decisions will support liquidit
y and funding conditions in the economy, help to 
sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining 
favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions, in order to underpin 
the recovery of the economy from the 
coronavirus fallout. At the same time, in the 
current rapidly evolving economic environment, the Governing Council remains fully 
committed to doing everything necessary within 
its
 mandate to support all citizens of 
the euro area through this extremely chal
lenging time. This applies first and foremost 
to 
the Governing Council™s 
role in ensuring that 
its 
monetary policy is transmitted to all 
parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of 
the ECB™s
 price stability 
mandate. The Governing Counci
l, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of 
its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a 
sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

  7 1 External environment
 The 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) pandemic has paralysed the global economy. Measures 
taken by governments across the globe to contain the spread of the virus 
imply a 
sharp decline in 
economic activity
 in the near term
. While s
everal countri
es have 
recently started easing containment measures, this process is likely to be very 
gradual. Economic activity, especially in emerging market economies
 (EMEs)
, is also 
being 
adversely affected by sharp
ly lower 
commodity prices, tighter financial 
condit
ions and substantial capital outflows.
 Incoming data confirm that the economic 
fallout 
from
 the pandemic and containment measures will be heavy and far
-reaching
. In view of these severe global disruptions, 
the June 2020 Eurosystem 
staff 
macroeconomic proje
ction
s envisage that 
world real GDP (excluding the euro area) 
will 
contract by 4.0% this year. Th
e pace of th
is contraction is faster and its magnitude 
greater
 than 
seen 
in the 
Great Recession
. Following a sharp contraction in the first two 
quarters of 2020, global activity is projected to 
start to 
recover 
in the third quarter. This 
profile implies that global activity is projected to increase by 6.0% and 3.9% in 2021 
and 2022 respectively.
 Glo
bal trade will be affected more
 severely
, as logistic
s disruptions and closed borders amplify the impact
 of the fallout
. Moreover, trade 
is procyclical, responding to 
developments in 
economic activity, especially in downturns.
 Despite a sharp deterioration
 in the global outlook, as embedded in the June 
projections, risks to this outlook are still skewed to the downside. 
Most importantly, the 
impact of the pandemic may prove to be stronger and longer lasting
 than currently 
expected
. Other risks 
relate
, for i
nstance, 
to 
an increased sensitivity of financial 
markets to news, structural changes 
in supply networks for production
 and the
 risk of 
a rise in trade protectionism.
 Global economic activity and trade
 The COVID
-19 pandemic has paralysed the global 
economy.
 Measures taken by 
governments across the globe 
to contain the spread of the virus 
imply 
a sharp declin
e in economic activity in the near term.
 Such measures were introduced in China in 
late 
January, while other countries enacted them later as the 
virus spread globally. 
While 
several countries have recently started easing containment measures, this process is 
likely to be very gradual. Economic activity, especially in EMEs, 
is being 
adversely 
affected by sharp
ly lower
 commodity prices, tighter finan
cial conditions and 
substantial capital outflows. These severe global shocks hit the world economy at a 
time when signs of a stabilisation, following a period of lacklustre performance last 
year, had been increasingly evident. In particular, a nascent reco
very in 
manufacturing activity and trade, led by large EMEs, had been under way at the turn 
of the year. Moreover, the favourable global financial conditions prevailing at that 
time, as well as a partial de
-escalation of the trade conflict between the Unit
ed States 
and China following the signing of the ﬁphase oneﬂ trade agreement, had 
had 
the 
potential to reinforce the recovery before the pandemic struck.
 Survey data confirm that the economic fallout 
from the pandemic
 and 
containment measures will be 
heavy
 and 
far
-reaching
. Looking at sectoral
 data
 from the Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) survey,
 three patterns emerge. First,

 environment
  8 output plummeted 
across sectors 
as stringent containment measures were put in 
place. Second, the impact on the service
s sector was g
reater 
than the impact
 on 
manufacturing. 
With
 containment policies suppress
ing
 supply 
and demand 
globally, 
output in both 
the 
manufacturing and services
 sectors
 has 
deteriorated much more 
rapidly than 
occurred dur
ing the 
Great Recession (see Chart 1)
. Thir
d, as production 
resumes, output recovers from its depressed levels
 Œ as 
seen
 recently in China. 
However
, for several reasons
, this recovery is only partial. These 
reasons 
relate to 
restrictions 
that 
still 
remain 
in place for businesses 
that 
requir
e close 
social interaction
; behavioural changes by consumers amid worries about a second wave of infections
; and high uncertainty hindering investment decisions which
, in turn
, lowers demand in 
the near term and weighs on productive capacity 
in the longer term
. The global 
composite 
output PMI (excluding the euro area) 
recovered somewhat in
 May
, supported by better 
results
 for both the manufacturing and services sectors.
 However, 
it remains deep in contractionary territory.

May 2020. The
 data cover the period from January 1999 to 
May
 2020. The global financial crisis 
sample (yellow dots) den
otes the period from December 2007 to June 2009. The COVID
-19 pandemic sample (red dots) denotes the 
period from January 2020 to 
May
 2020. The more cautious behaviour of consumers is reflected in 
a sharp 
decline in
 global 
confidence indicators.
 Consumer co
nfidence 
has 
deteriorated significantly in 
recent weeks, e
specially in advanced economies
. In addition
, the worsening labour 
market will lead consumers to 
adopt 
more cautious behaviour characterised by higher 
precautionary savings and lower consumption, pa
rticularly of durable goods.
 Financial conditions tightened sharply, but some of this tightening 
has eased 
more recently.
 Initially, the tightening was swift and broad

 advanced 
economies and EMEs alike. In addition, EMEs 
have seen
 substant
ial financial 
outflows in both gross and net terms, although 
the 
latest data suggest that these 
outflows have moderated or even reversed in recent weeks. 
Despite these signs of a 
stabilisation, financial stress remains elevated, partly owing to an
 increas
e in 
the 
incidence of 
confirmed new 
cases 
of 
COVID
-19 and deaths in EMEs
. Notably, 
financial investors fled from EMEs indiscriminately in the initial phase of the crisis

  9 related to the pandemic, but 
differences in macroeconomic fundamentals and 
vulnerabilit
ies across 
EMEs
 now seem to 
have become increasingly relevant
 for 
investment decisions
. Overall, financial conditions remain substantially tighter in both advanced 
economies and EMEs than before the pandemic struck.
 However, taking a 
longer
-term perspective, 
they 
remain more favourable than in past 
global downturns, 
including the Great Recession and the recession that followed the bursting of the 
dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. 
In part, this may reflect the rapid 
and aggressive 
response of central banks around the world. Most notably, monetary policy 
interventions are likely to be the key factor behind the stabilisation 
in sovereign bond 
yields and term
 premia, despite the unprecedented 
level of 
global sovereign de
bt 
issuance necessitated by the pandemic.
 Uncertainty increased substantially and 
remains elevated. 
While 
it is still 
too 
early to judge 
what
 role elevated uncertainty 
has 
played 
in the current crisis, it is likely 
to weigh on 
the 
recovery prospects.
 The J
une 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections envisage that 
world real GDP (excluding the euro area) 
will decline by 4.0%
 this year
. The pace 
of 
this 
contraction is faster and its magnitude much 
greater
 than seen in
 the 
Great 
Recession
. Following a s
harp contraction in the first two quarters of 2020, 
economic 
activity is projected to recover from
 the third quarter. As lockdowns are lifted, activity is 
projected to rebound initially, but the overall pace of 
the 
recovery is assumed to be 
gradual owing t
o social distancing measures kept in place 
and also owing
 to changing 
consumer behaviour.
 Looking further ahead, 
the June
 2020 
Eurosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic projections 
envisage that global activity will
 increas
e by 6.0% in 2021 
and 3.9% in 2022. Compared
 with
 the March 
2020 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections, global growth 
has been
 revised significantly down for this year, while 
growth 
over
 the medium
-term horizon is expected to be slightly stronger. These 
revisions also imply that the level of global ou
tput remains below the trajectory 
projected in the March 2020 
ECB staff macroeconomic projections
. For EMEs, 
the 
recovery is expected to be
 more subdued 
than those seen after
 previous downturns. 
This reflects 
the
 combination of negative shocks affecting 
EMEs
 at the current 
juncture, including the 
pandemic
 crisis, tight financial conditions, negative terms of 
trade shocks for commodity exporters, and substantial capital outflows.
 In the United States, 
the pace of the contraction in 
economic activity
 is 
estimated to have accelerated in the second quarter of 2020.
 Real GDP declined 
by 5.0% on an annualised basis in the first quarter, according to the second estimate. 
This contraction was slightly larger than reported in the advance estimate. Higher 
frequency 
data suggest that the economic downturn deepened further in the second 
quarter, as strict containment measures were in place across the country in April. 
From late April US states started to 
gradually 
ease 
the 
containment measures, which 
should help to sup
port a recovery in the second half of 2020. It will be led by a recovery 
in domestic demand 
backed by 
the 
strong 
economic 
policy support 
enacted to date. 
However, the recovery is projected to be gradual, as consumer confidence remains at 
depressed levels a
mid unprecedented job destruction recorded since late March. 
Employment decreased by more than 22 million 
jobs
 and
 the unemployment rate 
reached 14.7%
 in April
. Annual headline consumer price inflation dropped sharply to

 External
 environment
  10 0.3% in April
, from 1.5% in the pre
vious month
. Excluding food and energy, annual 
inflation 
declined to 1.4% in April from
 2.1% in March. 
Inflation is expected to decline 
this year, 
as the disinflationary effects of the demand shock outweigh inflationary 
effects stemming from supply disrupt
ions
, and is projected to gradually increase to 
stand closer to the Federal Reserve System™s 2% target towards the end of the 
projection horizon
. In China
, the 
recovery is proceeding 
amid strong headwinds.
 These
 include weak
 external demand
 prospects in th
e near term, 
as evidenced by the sharp fall in export 
orders, and a 
grad
ual recovery in domestic demand. The latter reflects the remaining 
social distancing measures in place, as well as generally more cautious consumer 
behaviour. The monetary and policy s
timulus enacted by the authorities will help to 
support economic activity. Looking ahead, activity is projected to recover over the 
projection horizon. However, this recovery is assumed to remain muted compared with 
the level of activity foreseen in the Ma
rch projections.
 In Japan
, the 
economy 
has 
slipped into a technical recession
. Activity declined in 
the fourth quarter of last year owing to a 
confluence of negative shocks, including 
a fall 
in 
domestic demand 
as a result of
 the 
consumption tax 
hike, production disruptions 
caused by 
powerful typhoons in October,
 and weak external demand. 
Subsequently, 
amid the COVID
-19 outbreak, real GDP contracted further, declining by 0.9% in the 
first quarter of 2020. Authorities™ efforts to contain the virus 
weighed on domestic 
demand, especially private 
consumption of services and semi
-durable goods. 
Notably
, exports of services fell markedly, reflecting lower spending by inbound 
tourists owing to the travel restrictions imposed in reaction to the outbreak. 
The Japanese authorities stepped up policy support for the ailing economy. 
In April the 
Bank of Japan raised the limits on purchases of commercial paper and corporate 
bonds, eased access to corporate funding facilities and purchased short
-term and 
longer
-term government bonds. At its emergency meeting in May it decided to launch 
a new fund
-provisioning measure for banks to support lending to small and 
medium
-sized enterprises. In late May the Japanese government approved a second 
fiscal stimulus package 
that
 is 
broadly comparable in size to the one 
implemented
 in 
April 2020. These measures should provide further stimulus to the economy, which is 
projected to gradually recover from the second half of this year.
 In the United Kingdom, 
the economic situation has
 deteriorated significantly.
 Real 
GDP fell by 2% in the first quarter
 of 2020
, even though the economy was locked 
down for just the 
last
 ten
 days of March
, while a
nnual 
consumer price 
inflation fell to 
0.8% in April, down sharply from 1.5% 
in the previous 
month. 
While the furlough 
scheme has helped 
to 
maintain employment, 
the labour market situation has 
deteriorated markedly. 
Experimental ONS data on 
benefit 
claimants
 Œ covering the 
unemployed, as well as those receiving in
-work benefits 
Œ showed 
that by mi
d-April 
more than
 two million citizens 
were 
claiming some form of benefit. 
This is around 
one
-third more than the number observed during the Great Recession. High frequency 
data signal a
 further marked deterioration 
in the second quarter, which implies a 
much 
more severe
 recession than occurred in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. 
The 
government has announced a phased reopening of the economy, 
which is expected to 
support a gradual 
recovery in the coming months.

 environment
  11 In central and eastern European 
countries
, economic activity 
is expected
 to 
weaken substantially.
 A large number of countries in the region recorded negative 
growth in the first quarter of 2020, amid supply disruptions and weaker demand 
caused by containment measures. Looking ahead, a mu
ch deeper downturn is 
expected in the second quarter. This reflects the interplay of weaker domestic demand 
Œ as the containment measures remained in place throughout April 
Œ with weaker 
external demand, especially from the euro area countries.
 Economic
 activity in large commodity
-exporting countries
 is expected to fall 
precipitously.
 In Russia
, the economy has been buffeted by recent energy market 
developments
 and 
by 
the 
COVID
-19 pandemic,
 taking a toll on 
external demand
. At 
the same time, 
there has been 
a steep rise in new domestic cases of infection
, resulting in
 a tightening of measures to contain the 
spread of the virus
. The 
production 
cuts agreed by OPEC+ to stabilise 
the global oil
 market
, as well as lower commodity 
prices
, are 
expected to dampen inv
estment. In Brazil, economic activity deteriorated 
sharply owing to lockdowns, supply chain disruption, weaker external demand, 
significant capital outflows and 
a negative term
s of trade shock reflect
ing
 falling 
commodity prices
. Rising political tensions 
and the fact that the country is one of the 
worst
-affected by the pandemic, may complicate the provision of effective policy 
support for the economy.
 In Turkey, the pandemic 
gave rise to financing pressures, amid 
high external 
imbalances and financing need
s. Activity remained robust until late March
. Thereafter,
 sentiment started to erode 
rapidly
, as containment measures were 
introduced and external demand contracted sharply. At the same time, foreign 
investors 
became
 increasingly risk
-averse 
vis
-à-vis
 EMEs and signs of financing 
pressures for Turkey appeared. The 
Turkish 
lira has weakened and central bank 
reserves have dropped sharply. 
A steep contraction in activity is expected in the first 
half of 2020, while the ensuing recovery is projected to be v
ery 
gradual.
 Global trade will be affected more 
severely than activity
, as logistic
s disruptions and closed borders amplify the impact of falling demand.
 Moreover, 
the procyclical response of 
trade to 
developments in 
economic activity 
tends to 
intensify in
 downturns. 
The collapse in global merchandise trade is likely to be 
amplified by disruptions in regional and global value chains
, as the significant share 
of trade in intermediate goods 
Œ accounting for around 40% of world trade 
Œ has 
important implicatio
ns for the international transmission of demand and supply 
shocks. A sharp decline in trade is already visible in 
global merchandise imports, 
which 
contracted
 by 
2.9% in 
the first quarter of 2020 (see Chart 2) 
Œ the largest 
quarterly drop since the Great R
ecession. At the same time, the pace of the decline in 
merchandise imports was broadly comparable across advanced economies and 
EMEs.

 The indices and data 
refer to the global aggregate excluding the euro area.
 Owing to the nature of the shock, services trade has been particularly hard hit.
 Incoming data on tourism and transportation, which together account for the bulk of 
global service
s trade, indicate an unprecedented decline. International tourist arrivals 
declined by more than 50% in March. Similarly, the volume of passengers on 
international flights has more than halved compared with 
the same period 
last year.
 According to the June 
2020 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections
, global 
import growth (excluding the euro area) 
is expected to 
decline by 12.9% this year, 
before increasing by 8.0% and 4.3% in 2021 and 2022 respectively
. Euro area foreign 
demand is projected to contract b
y 15.1% this year and 
to 
grow by 7.8% and 4.2% in 
2021 and 2022 respectively.
 The 
pandemic has had a substantial 
impact on trade 
Œ world imports (excl
uding
 the 
euro area) are 
not 
projected to return to the 
levels 
recorded in the fourth quarter of 
2019 unti
l towards the end of the projection horizon. 
Euro area foreign demand remains below this level over the whole projection 
horizon.
 The degree of uncertainty about the future course of 
the 
global economy 
remains unprecedented
. It 
relates
 to the evolution of 
the pandemic and its impact on 
economic behaviour, as well as the associated containment measures and the 
success of the policy measures
. To illustrate the range of possible impacts of the

. These scenarios can be seen as providing an 
illustrative range around the baseline projection
.2 The COVID

put 
in motion a number of developments which could weigh on the projected recovery 
of the global economy.
 They
 include, for instance, increased sensitivity of financial

  13 in a
ddition to other downside risks related to the Brexit negotiations and

although they

the future course of the COVID
-19 pandemic and 
the 
policy measures taken.
 Global
 price developments
 The sharp deterioration in global demand prospects has 
caused
 oil prices 
to 
fall 
dramatically.
 Brent crude oil prices have recently recovered somewhat to 
stand 
above USD 30 per barrel, having plunged below USD 20 per barrel in early Apr
il. The 
partial recovery in oil prices appears to be driven by hopes of a reversal of the sudden 
collapse in global oil demand associated with the pandemic, as China recovers and 
lockdowns in other countries are gradually eased. Oil prices have also been s
upported 
by the gradual response of oil supply
 as 
the OPEC+ agreement came into effect at the 
beginning of May
 and 
oil production in the U
nited 
States
 and Canada 
declined owing 
to extensive shutdowns. 
Compared with the March 2020 
ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections, the crude oil price assumptions in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections are 
36.0%, 33.1% and 26.6% 
lower for 
2020, 2021 and 
2022. Since the cut
-off date for the 
June
 projections, the price of 
crude 
oil has 
increased
, with Bre
nt crude standing at USD
 38.3
 per barrel on 
3 June
. Looking 
ahead, crude oil prices are likely to remain volatile. 
This is a reflection of the fact that 
the economic outlook remain
s highly uncertain and storage capacity utilisation 
is 
exceptionally high.
 Global inflation is being dampened by a
 sharp decline in oil prices.
 Annual
 headline consumer price inflation in 
OECD
 countries slowed 
sharply
 to 
0.9% in 
April,
 from 
1.7% in 
March
, driven by a sharp fall in oil prices
 and lower core inflation (see 
Chart 3)
. Following a collapse in crude oil price
s associated with the pandemic
, annual 
energy price inflation 
had already 
turned negative
 in March and the pace of this 
decline accelerated sharply to 10.8% in April
, marking the biggest drop since 
September 2015. I
n contrast, annual food price inflation accelerated further to 6.4% in 
April, from 3.5% in the previous month. At the same time
, annual core 
CPI 
inflation
 (excluding food and energy)
 decreased to 
1.6% in April, 
from 2.
1% in the previous 
month
. Looking ahea
d, global inflation will decrease amid lower oil prices and weaker 
demand.
 These
 factors outweigh any potential inflationary impact 
from
 lower supply 
caused by bottlenecks in production and logistics. Weak demand, 
a sharp 
deteriorati
on in labour markets an
d greater
 slack are likely to weaken underlying 
inflation pressures globally. Lower oil prices explain much of the downward revision to 
euro area competitors™ export prices (in national currency) in 2020. As the 
price of 
crude oil is expected to gradually 
increase over the projection horizon, this impact 
will 
dissipate and euro area competitors
™ export prices are projected to return to their 
long
-term average towards the end of 2021.

 Although financial conditions in the euro area have loosened somewhat since the 
Governing Council™s meeting in 
March 2020, they have not returned to the levels seen 
before the global spread of the coronavirus (COVID
-19).
 Over the 
review period 
(12 
March 2020 to 3 June 2020) the forward curve of the euro overnight index average 
(EONIA) shifted upwards. A slight 
inve
rsion at short maturities
 is still present, albeit 
less so than on 12 March, and 
signals
 that market participants™ expectations of further 
policy rate cuts have diminished and shifted further into the future. 
Despite 
the 
monetary policy accommodation provi
ded via
 the 
pandemic emergency purchase 
programme (
PEPP
) and other policy measures
, long
-term euro area sovereign bond 
yields increase
d over the review period
 owing to an increase in risk
-free rates and a 
widening of sovereign spreads
. Prices of risk asset
s partly recovered from the losses 
incurred during February and March, mainly against the backdrop of an 
improvement 
in global risk sentiment and the perception that tail risks of an imminent global crisis 
have faded to some extent. 
In foreign exchange mar
kets
, the euro remained broadly
 stable in trade
-weighted terms
, with volatility in bilateral exchange rates reflecting 
uncertainty around the COVID
-19 pandemic.
 The EONIA
 and the new benchmark 
euro short
-term rate (•STR)
 average
d -45 and 
-54 basis points 
respectively
 over the review period
.3 Excess liquidity 
increased by 
•398 billion 
in the period under review 
to around •
2,163 billion.
4 This 
change
 mainly reflects the introduction of the PEPP alongside the asset purchase 
programme (APP), as well as the tak
e-up of targeted longer
-term refinancing 
operations (TLTRO III) and LTRO bridge operations.
  The 
short end of the 
EONIA forward curve shifted upwards over the review 
period, 
although the curve
 remain
s slightly 
inverted (see 
Chart 4).
 The short end 
of the c
urve flattened following the Governing Council meeting on 12 March, as 
markets postponed expectations 
of an imminent reduction in the deposit facility rate. 
Nevertheless
, the inversion in the short end of the curve
 contrasts with the flat curve 
observed
 before
 the spread of the virus, which indicates 
that 
market participants 
continue to expect 
some further
 reductions in policy rates.
                                         
                           
 3  The methodology for computing the EONIA changed on 2 October 2019; it is now calculated as the •STR 
plus a fixed spread of 8.5 basis points

  21 3 Economic activity
 Euro area real GDP growth 
declined on an unprecedented scale
 in the first quarter of 
2020, in a context of stringent
 lockdown measures implemented 
by euro area 
countries to contain the sp
read of the coronavirus (COVID
-19). Although 
high
-frequency indicators and t
he latest survey results 
have recently 
point
ed to 
some 
modest improvements in levels of economic activity as
 countries 
have started to 
relax 
the
ir lockdown measures
, the severe imp
act on activity in April and May point to a 
further decline in
 the second quarter
 of 2020. 
Looking ahead, a rebound in euro area 
economic activity 
is expected 
in the second half of 2020, 
supported by favourable 
financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal 
stance and a resumption in global activity, 
although the overall speed and scale of the rebound remain highly uncertain. 
In the 
baseline scenario of the 
June
 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for 
the euro area
, annual real GDP
 is expected 
to 
fall by 8.7% in 2020 and to rebound by 
5.2% in 2021 and by 3.3% in 2022
. Compared with the March 
2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections, 
the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised 
substantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised
 upwards by 3.9 
percentage points in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022.
 Euro area activity saw an unprecedented fall 
in the first quarter of 20
20, amid 
COVID
-19 containment measures and the associated extreme uncertainty.
 Real
 GDP 
declined
 by 
a record
 3.8
%, in quarter
-on-quarter terms, in the first quarter of 
2020, in a context of stringent lockdown policies implemented by most euro area 
countries from mid
-March onwards. 
The contraction
 caused by COVID
-19 was
 heterogeneous
 across countries and sectors
. Among the largest euro area 
economies,
 there were 
stronger declines
 in economic activity
 in France, Italy and 
Spain than in Germany and the Netherlands. 
Economic 
growth
 in euro area countries 
in 
the first quarter of 2020 was negatively correlated with t
he restrictiveness of 
social 
distancing measures and the lockdowns to
 contain the spread of COVID
-19 (Chart 
10). Overall, t
he 
impact of
 the lockdown measures translated into a marked 
contraction
 in 
euro area 
industrial production
, which 
declined by 
an unprec
edented
 11.3%
, month 
on month,
 in March
 2020, and by
 3.3% in quarter
-on-quarter terms in 
the first quarter of 2020. Similarly, 
capacity utilisation dropped sharply
 by 11 
percentage points 
to 69.7%
 in the manufacturing sector
 and by around 5 percentage 
poin
ts to 85.6% 
in the
 services
 sector, 
according to survey
 data for the first quarter of 
2020.  ECB Economic Bull

-19 containment measures.
 Employment declined by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, 
following an increase of 0.3% in th
e fourth quarter of 2019. T
he muted decline in 
employment is mostly explained by 
policy measures
6, such as the introduction of 
short
-time work schemes and a complementary policy package aimed at preventing 
redundancies and supporting self
-employed workers.
 Short
-time work schemes 
limit 
increases in the number of unemployed workers while allowing for an increase in the 
flexibility of the labour market to face cyclical fluctuations. At the current juncture, this 
involves a substantial reduction in hours worke
d per person employed
 for a 
predetermined 
length
 of time.
7 The 
decline in
 employment 
recorded during the first 
quarter of 2020 is therefore less than
 the decline
 in 
GDP, implying a marked 3.5% 
decline in 
labour productivity per person employed in 
the first
 quarter of 2020.
 Recent short
-term labour market indicators 
point to a sharp deterioration in the 
labour market, while the slight increase in the unemployment rate also reflects 
statistical issues linked to the lockdowns and the mitigating impact of the 
unprecedented 
policy
 measures to 
support
 employment.
 The euro area 
unemployment rate increased to 7.3% in April 2020, from 7.1% in March. The increase 
in the unemployment rate does not fully capture the adverse impact of the pandemic, 
as it reflects the impact of the COVID
-19 containment policies on the labo
ur market 
(with lockdowns implemented in various countries only by mid
-March), the adoption of 
labour market policies to bolster employment and prevent permanent lay
-offs, and 
statistical classification issues during the lockdown period. 
Recent survey outc
omes 
provide a more timely indication of labour market developments
 and 
suggest that the 
labour market is now deep in contractionary territory
. There was, however, a limited

 A large share of private consumption h
as collapsed since mid
-March.
 Euro area 
retail trade declined by 1
1%, month on month, in March 2020
. These data only partly 
reflect the drop in spending during the lockdowns, 
which were only 
introduced 
in mid
-March in most
 euro area
 countries. Monthly reta
il sales in April dropped further 
by 
12%, month on month, 
with 
an almost complete collapse in other expenditure 
categories such as 
car
s and holidays. 
In May 2020 euro area 
consumer confidence 
started to bottom out
 as lockdowns were gradually relaxed.
 While
 the drop in 
household income has been limited, the saving ratio is likely to rise sharply.
8 This 
reflects standard channels such as (countercyclical) precautionary savings and credit 
constraints, but there is some evidence that it is also driven by ﬁforce
d savingsﬂ. 
Households whose income was unaffected started to accumulate significant bank 
deposits,
 as they were unable to buy non
-essential goods and services.
9 Accumulated savings could finance a strong rebound in non
-essential consumption in 
the second 
half of 2020. However, this is highly dependent on the remaining 
uncertainty surrounding the health crisis and labour market conditions, which could 
lead to further precautionary savings.
 Business investment is expected to have contracted in the first quar
ter of 2020 
to a larger extent than GDP, and a further decline is expected 
in the second 
quarter.
 Faced
 with severe supply
 disruptions since mid

investment declined, in quarter

 by 4.1% in 
Germany, 
9.3
% in France
 (referring to investment by non
-financial corporations)
, 8.3% 
in Italy, 
2.4% in Spain and 6.6% in the Netherlands. Furt
hermore, the latest euro area 
bank lending survey
10 shows a 
large
 increase in euro area firms™ demand for loans 
and credit lin
es in 
the first quarter of 2020
, as companies use
d bank financing to 
secure emergency liquidity to cover ongoing payments (e.g. rents and salaries) amid 
a collapse
 in revenues. At the same time, demand for loans for investment purposes 
declined strongly. G
oing forward, the sharp declines in confidence and production 
expectations and falls in order books and sales in the 
capital goods 
sector in April, 
together with prevailing 
elevated
 uncertainty, point to a pronounced contraction in 
investment in fixed capi
tal in 
the second quarter
. Following a marked deterioration in the first quarter of 2020, euro area housing 
investment may experience an even larger contraction in the second quarter.
 Looking at the available country data for the first quarter, constructio
n investment 
experienced major declines in France (
-13.8%, quarter on quarter), Italy (
-7.9%) and 
Spain (
-9.6%), while it surprisingly improved in Germany (4.1%) and the Netherlands 
(5.6%). This evidence points to a major decline in euro area housing inves
tment in the 
first quarter.
 As the 
survey
-based 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) for
 residential 
construction output 
and the European Commission™s indicator for construction 
confidence plummeted in April, the deterioration in euro area housing markets may 
even intensify in the second quarter. On the supply side, construction activity has been 
limited, as lockdown measures have led to the closure of construction sites in several 
countries and the cost of materials has increased. On the demand side, this 
dete
rioration has been accompanied by a sharp decline in the European 
Commission™s indicator of intentions to spend on renovations as well as the demand 
for housing loans according to the euro area bank lending survey
. This weakening 
demand has affected even t
hose countries which have implemented the least 
stringent lockdown measures, such as Germany and the Netherlands.
 The contraction 
in euro area trade is expected to have steepened in 
the second 
quarter of 
2020. In the first quarter, intra
-euro area trade in
 goods contracted more 
than extra
-euro area trade as a result of the 
COVID
-19 containment measures 
adopted by euro area 
countries.
 An unprecedented decline is 
expected
 for 
the second 
quarter of 
2020, as 
suggested 
by the collapse of the new export orders 
index
 to 18.9
 in 
April
 (compared with 49.5 at the beginning of 
2020). The same leading indicator™s 
recovery to 28.7 in May points to early signs of a very gradual expansion thereafter
. Euro area trade is particularly exposed to the 
COVID
-19 shock owing to 
some specific 
features. First, Europe is an important
 tourist
 destination
, account
ing
 for 30% of global 
tourism receipts
. Consequently, the region has been
 particularly 
affected
 by travel 
bans, restrictions
 on 
movement
 and lockdown measures. The implicatio
ns are
, of 
course
, most severe in euro area countries where tourism accounts for a 
large
 share 
of GDP. Second, the extraordinary degree of uncertainty and the ensuing 
postponement of investment decisions have weighed
 in particular
 on trade in 
durables, a c
ore component of euro area exports. Third, spillover and spillback effects 
via regional production networks transmit a
nd magnify shocks across euro area

 In the near term, a larger decline in

downwards by 9.5 percentage points in
 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 percentage

 Nevertheless, elevated global 
uncertainty around the implementation of 
post

 plans and the extent of the 
contraction and 
subsequent
 recovery will depend c
rucially on the duration and the 
effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the

and domestic demand are permanently affected.

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 
0.1
% in 
May
 2020, from 
0.3
% in 
April
. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil
, headline inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months 
and remain subdued until the end of the year.
 Over the medium term, weaker demand will 
put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward 
pressures related to supply constraints.
 This assessment is 
also broadly
 reflected in 
the June
 2020 Eurosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which 
foresee annual HICP inflation at
 0.3
% in 2020,
 0.8
% in 2021 and 
1.3
% in 2022
. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, 
the outlook for 
HICP inflation 
has been
 revised down by 0.8, 0.6 and 0.3 percentage points 
respectively
. Annual HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 
0.8% 
in 2020, 0.7% in 2021 and 0.9% in 2022
. According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, HICP inflation
 continued to
 dec
rease
 in 
May
. The decrease from 0.3% in April to 0.1% in May reflected mainly a decline in 
energy and unprocessed food price inflation, while HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food remained broadly unchanged.
 Falling energy price inflation remained the 
main driver of inflation dynamics, still reflecting the sharp drop in oil prices after the 
onset of the global coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic. In contrast, food price inflation 
Œ in particular unprocessed food price inflation 
Œ has surged in the context of
 the

 (annual percentage changes)

 Notes: The latest observations are for 
May 2020
 for 
the 
HICP excluding energy and food (flash estimate)
 and for 
April 2020
 for all other 
measures. The range of measures of underlying inflation consists of the following: HICP ex
cluding energy; HICP excluding energy and 
unprocessed food; HICP excluding energy and food; HICP excluding energy, food, travel
-related items and clothing; the 10% trimmed 
mean of the HICP; the 30% trimmed mean of the HICP; and the weighted median of the H
ICP. Growth rates for 
the 
HICP excluding 
energy and food for 2015 are distorted upwards owing to a methodological change (see the box entitled ﬁ
A new method for the package 
holiday price index in Germany and its impact on HICP inflation rates
ﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue 2, ECB, 2019).
 Pipeline price pressures for 
the 
HICP non
-energy industrial goods 
component 
indicate some weakening at the la
ter stages of the supply chain.
 Producer
 price 
inflation for domestic sales of non
-food consumer goods, which is an indicator of price 
pressures at the later stages of the supply chain, 
fell further to
 0.5%, year on year,
 in 
April, 
from 0.
6% in 
March and 
0.7% in February
. The corresponding
 annual
 rate of 
import price inflation 
decreased to 0.1% in March, after 0.5% 
in 
the previous month, 
which may 
in 
part reflect some downward pressure from the recent appreciation of the 
euro effective exchange rate.
 Earli
er in the domestic pricing chain, intermediate goods 
price inflation weakened sharply
, reflecting the pass
-through of lower oil prices as well 
as the effects of a stronger euro. 
For intermediate goods, producer price inflation 
declined to 
-2.7% in April, f
rom 
-1.8% in March
 and 
-1.2% in February,
 while import 
price inflation fell sharply to 
-1.3% in March
, after 
-0.1% in February.
 Wage growth 
declined
. Annual growth in compensation per employee stood at 
1.7
% in the 
fourth
 quarter of 2019, down from 2.
1% in 
the third
 quarter (see Chart 1
6). Looking ahead, the impact on wage growth measures from labour market policies 
activated in response to the pandemic, such as short
-time work schemes, will depend 
on how such 
schemes 
are treated in official statistics.
14 Ann
ual growth in negotiated 
wages in the euro area 
stood at 
2.0% 
in the 
first
 quarter of 20
20, slightly down
 from 
2.1
% in the 
fourth
 quarter
 of 2019
. Negotiated wage growth may be holding up so far 
because it reflects agreements made in the past, while any ch
anges in actual wage 
growth will show in corresponding wage drift.

 Note: The latest observations are for 
3 June
 2020. The June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresee a 
significantly weaker outlook for inflation over the projection horizon.
 The 
baseline projections expect headline HICP inflation to average 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 
2021 and 1.3% in 2022
. These represent downward revisions of 0.8, 0.6 and 0.3 
percentage points respectively, compared with the March 2020 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections (see Chart
 18). In the short term, the recent collapse in oil 
prices implies a sharp drop in headline 
HICP inflation to levels around zero for the 
coming quarters, before base effects in the energy component cause a mechanical 
rebound in early 2021. HICP inflation excluding energy
 and food
 is also expected to 
decline over the short
 term but by less than he
adline inflation. Disinflationary effects 
are expected to be broad
-based across the prices of services and goods as demand 
will remain weak. However, these effects are expected to be offset
, in part,
 by cost 
pressures related to supply
-side disruptions and
 shortages. Over the medium term, 
inflation is expected to increase as the oil price is assumed to pick up and as demand 
recovers. HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to decline to 0.8% on 
average in 2020 and 
to fall 
further to 0.7% in 202
1, before increasing to 0.9% in 2022. 
Finally, 
given the high level of uncertainty, two alternative scenarios for inflation have 
been prepared by Eurosystem staff.
15 Under the mild scenario, headline inflation 
would reach 1.7% by 2022 while, under the
 corre
sponding
 severe scenario, headline 
inflation would be 0.9% at the end of the projection horizon.

  33 5 Money and credit
 The coronavirus (COVID
-19) pa
ndemic caused a sharp acceleration in monetary 
dynamics, driven by the acute liquidity needs of firms to finance ongoing payments 
and a strong preference for liquidity for precautionary reasons among economic 
agents owing to the great uncertainty surroundi
ng the pandemic. Domestic credit was 
the main source of money creation, driven by loans to non
-financial corporations 
(NFCs)
 and net purchases of government 
bonds by monetary financial institutions 
(MFIs). The timely and sizeable measures by monetary, fisc
al and supervisory 
authorities supported the extension of bank credit on favourable terms to the euro area 
economy. This also buoyed euro area firms™ total external financing in the first quarter 
of 2020, while market
-based financing was more modest, as th
e cost of market
-based 
debt increased significantly in the first quarter. Bank lending rates reached historical 
lows, which kept firms™ overall cost of debt financing favourable.
 Precautionary liquidity holdings and acute liquidity needs led to a strong 
acceleration in monetary dynamics.
 The annual growth rate of M3 
surged further to 
8.3% in April, from 
7.5% in March, and was around 3 percentage points above the 
growth rate in February, i.e. before the wider spread of the COVID
-19 pandemic in the 
euro area 
(see Chart 19). This increase was on account of large monthly flows in 
March (which saw the largest flows since the beginning of Stage Three of Economic 
and Monetary Union) and in April. Monetary dynamics were driven by a combination of 
factors, including 
liquidity needs of firms, a preference for holding liquidity for 
precautionary reasons in a period of great uncertainty, and the need among 
institutional investors for liquidity buffers to cope with possible redemptions. High 
money growth was also the resu
lt of sizeable support measures from monetary and 
fiscal policymakers and regulatory and supervisory authorities to ensure sufficient 
liquidity in the economy to deal with the 
COVID
-19 pandemic
. In this environment, the 
annual growth rate of the most liqui
d monetary aggregate, M1, 
which comprises 
overnight deposits and currency in circulation
, reached 11.9% in April, after 10.4% in 
March, and was almost 4 percentage points higher than in February.
 Overnight deposits
 remained the main contributor to money gr
owth
. The
 annual 
growth rate
 of overnight deposits increased to 
12.5% in
 April
, from 10.9% in March. 
The growth in deposits was mainly driven by deposit holdings of firms.
 This 
accumulation of deposits, which reflects a precautionary build
-up of liquidity buffers 
given the great uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, was the result of substantial 
borrowing from banks, issuance of corporate bonds 
and
, to some extent, direct 
liquidity support 
from 
governments
. At the same time, there is heterogeneity in deposit 
holdings of firms across jurisdictions which may hint at differences in the extent to 
which the liquidity needs of firms have already materialised, partly related to 
diff
erences in the timing of the spread of the pandemic across countries. Both financial 
intermediaries other than MFIs (which includes investment funds) and households 
also increased their deposit holdings, the former to build up their liquidity buffers in 
case of redemptions and the latter mainly for precautionary reasons, but also owing to 
more limited opportunities to consume during the lockdown period. The annual growth 
rate of 
currency in circulation
 increased further to 8.0% in April, up from 7.0% in 
Mar
ch, reflecting the tendency to hoard cash in a period of great uncertainty.

creation
. Following 
a marked rise in March
, the annual growth rate of c
redit to the 
private sector
 increased somewhat further in April 
(see the blue portion of the bars in 
Chart 
20) on account of sizeable loan growth to firms 
as well as a higher acquisition of 
corporate bonds
, while 
negative flows in loans to 
non
-MFIs partly 
offset the large 
lending flow to firms
. In addition to credit to the private sector, the annual growth rate 
of 
credit 
from 
the banking sector (excluding the Eurosystem) 
to the public sector
 increased 
substantially in April (see the light green portion of the bars in Chart 
20). In 
spite of the stepping
-up of Eurosystem asset purchase programmes, 
in net terms 
euro 
area banks 
(excluding the Eurosystem) 
acquired large amount
s of government bonds, 
mainly of
 domestic origin
, partly reflecting
 the sizeable increase in net issuance of 
government debt to cope with the pandemic. In addition, m
onetary 
out
flows
 from the 
euro area increased in April, owing to sales of euro area sovereign bonds by 
non
-residents. The 
relatively moderate net external monetary flows are consistent with 
a combination of repatriation outflows for non
-euro area residents and repatriation 
inflows for euro area residents, in line with the typical home bias of investors during 
periods of great
 uncertainty (see the yellow portion of the bars in Chart 20). In addition 
to the increase in credit to euro area governments from MFIs (excluding the 
Eurosystem), Eurosystem net purchases of government securities in the context of the 
ECB™s asset purchase
 programme (APP) and especially the pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) contributed strongly to M3 growth 
(see the 
red
 portion of 
the 
bars in
 Chart
 20), reflecting the large monetary policy support
 to

 Notes: Credit to the private sector includes
 MFI loans to the private sector and MFI holdings of debt securities issued by th
e euro area 
private non
-MFI sector. 
As such, it also covers 
purchases by 
the Eurosystem of non
-MFI debt securities under the
 corporate sector 
purchase programme. The latest observation
s are
 for 
April 2020
. The annual growth rate of loans to the private
 sector
 increased strongly 
between February and April 2020, owing to 
a decline in firms™ 
revenues
 and 
precautionary 
borrowing in the context of 
the COVID
-19 pandemic
. The annual 
growth rate of 
MFI 
loans to the private sector 
remained broadly stable at 4.9%
 in April, 
following a marked increase 
to 
5.0%
 in March
 from 
3.7% in 
February
 (see Chart
 19). The growth was entirely 
driven by
 loans to firms, for which the annual growth rate rose 
further to 6.6%
 in April
, from 5.5% in March and 3.0% in February
 (see Cha
rt 21). The 
substantial strengthening of growth in loans to firms across most euro area countries 
reflected drawdowns of credit lines and substantial demand for new loans to cover 
ongoing payment obligations in a period of declining revenues during the 
COV
ID-19 lockdowns, as well as precautionary borrowing to bridge potential liquidity shortfalls. It 
also reflects the sizeable public measures, such as loan guarantees, to support firms™ 
liquidity and solvency over the coming months. Following strong demand f
or 
short
-term loans in March, firms increased their demand for medium and long
-term 
loans considerably in April as it became clear that the pandemic would last longer and 
given that public support schemes primarily cover loans up to a medium
-term maturity.
 The surge in loan demand from firms was also reported by banks in the April 2020 
euro area bank lending survey
 (BLS), where it was attributed mainly to fina
ncing 
needs for working capital, while financing needs for fixed investment declined. The 
timely and comprehensive policy measures supported the provision of lending on 
favourable terms in the first quarter of 2020. This is confirmed by the BLS results, 
according to which the net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms was 
contained in the first quarter of 2020 
and small compared with the 
tightening during the 
financial and sovereign debt crises

  36 The annual growth rate of loans to households 
moderated
, reflecting great 
uncertainty 
surrounding
 the impact of the pandemic
. In 
contrast 
to 
loans to firms
, the annual growth rate of loans to households declined somewhat 
further 
to 3.0% 
in 
April from 3.4% in March
. The moderation in household loan gro
wth indicates 
uncertainty among households about the impact of the pandemic on their disposable 
income and employment prospects. 
While the annual growth rate of loans to 
households for house purchase 
remained broadly stable in April
, at 3.9
%, 
after
 4.0
% in March
, the annual growth rate of consumer credit 
collapsed, to 1.3% in April, after 
3.8% in March and 6.2% in February
. This
 is in line with the unprecedented fall in 
consumer confidence 
and retail sales 
during the COVID
-19 lockdown period. The 
weakening 
of household loan demand is also confirmed in the April 2020 BLS results.
 In addition, there was considerable
 heterogeneity
 in loan growth to firms and 
households across euro area countries, reflecting, inter alia, cross
-country differences 
in economic gro
wth, in the availability of other funding sources, and in the levels of 
indebtedness of households and firms, although the pattern was broadly similar 
across large countries.

s™ debt funding costs
 remained contained, supported by 
monetary policy measures.
 The 
composite cost of debt financing
 for euro area 
banks, which
 had declined to very low levels in February 2020,
 increased in March in 
the context of the spre
ad of the COVID
-19 pandemic 
(see Chart
 23). The increase was 
driven by upward pressure on bank bond yields in reaction to the rise in sovereign 
bond yields and varied considerably across jurisdictions. In addition, concerns about a 
negative impact of the p
andemic on banks™ capital positions are weighing on banks™ 
market
-based funding costs. While banks have strengthened their resilience 
substantially since the global financial crisis, the coronavirus pandemic will weigh on 
banks™ capital positions through l
ower asset valuations and the need for higher loan 
loss provisions.
16 At the same time, the deterioration in banks™ debt funding costs 
remained contained
 overall. Deposit rates of euro area banks, which account for the 
bulk of bank funding, remained at a hi
storical low in March 2020, thereby contributing 
to favourable bank debt funding conditions. Bank funding conditions are also

targeted longer

TLTRO III) as well as from the beneficial 
impact of the APP and PEPP on bond yields, including a decline in bond yields after 
the announcement of the PEPP on 18 March. This mitigates the risk of adverse 
amplification between the real and financial sectors 
during the pandemic.

s are
 for 
March 2020
. Bank
 lending rates 
for firms reached new historical lows, but some increase is 
likely going forward
. Composite bank lending rates for loans to 
firms
 and for loans to 
households for house purchase reached new historical lows in March, at 1.46% and 
1.39% respectively (see Chart 
24). This development was widespread across euro 
area countries and reflects the lagged pass through of movements in market rates to 
bank lending rates. At the same time, given the increase in bank funding costs and the 
use of market reference rates for th
e pricing of bank loans, such as the euro interbank 
offered rate (EURIBOR), which increased over the reference period, some upward 
pressure on bank lending rates is likely in the coming months. In addition, the severe 
economic impact of the pandemic on fir
ms™ revenues, households™ employment 
prospects and overall borrower creditworthiness is likely to put upward pressure on 
bank lending rates. The tightening impact of risk perceptions on banks™ credit terms 
and conditions, as reported by banks in the April 
2020 BLS, already points in this 
direction. At the same time, liquidity support, for instance via tax deferrals and debt 
moratoria, loan guarantees and labour market support schemes, will stem some of the 
deterioration in borrowers™ creditworthiness during
 the crisis and exert a dampening 
effect on bank lending rates. The spread between bank lending rates on very small 
loans and large loans remained contained in March 2020. This supports the evidence 
above on new lending, which points to a broadly comparabl
e impact so far of the 
COVID
-19 pandemic on lending to SMEs and large firms, as captured by data on large 
and small loans.

The latest observation
s are
 for 
March 2020
. The annual flow of total external financing to euro area NFCs 
is estimated to 
have 
increased
 considerably in the first quarter of 2020 
(see
 panel (a) of
 Chart 
25). The increase was largely due t
o the exceptionally strong increase in bank lending 
to firms in March, 
supported by drawdowns of credit lines and public 
support
 schemes
. Demand for bank lending was also supported by more favourable bank lending rates 
relative to the cost of market
-based 
debt. The n
et issuance of debt securities 
by firms 
remained
 robust 
in the 
first 
quarter
 of 2020
, in spite of the increase in spreads towards 
the end of the quarter, 
benefitting from the 
ECB™s asset purchase programmes (APP 
and PEPP), which include net 
purchases of corporate bonds
. By contrast, net 
issuance of listed shares remained weak, dampened by the continued moderate level 
of mergers and acquisitions and an increase in the cost of equity from already 
elevated levels
. Loans from non
-banks (non
-MFIs
) remained
 negative in 
the fourth 
quarter of 
2019 and
 the first quarter of 2020
, pointing to a 
decline
 in annual terms in 
corporate 
bond issuance via 
firms™ 
financing conduits
 in other euro area countries
 (i.e. 
subsidiaries belonging to the 
non
-MFI sector 
granting loans to 
their parent 
companies
). Overall, total external financing flows were higher in the first quarter of 
2020 than during the financial and sovereign debt crises. This 
is consistent with the 
more supportive bank credit and bond market conditio
ns, bolstered by 
timely and 
sizeable
 measures by monetary,

Fiscal developments
 The 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) 
pandemic 
is having a significant impact on 
fiscal policies 
in the euro area. 
The
 outbreak of the 
crisis 
led
 to 
an immediate
 increase in 
direct 
costs
, in a bid to address the consequences for public health. However,
 f
rom a 
macroeconomic perspective
, 
much of 
the
 impact relates 
to the 
containment measures 
which are placing a severe economic burden 
on firms, workers and households
. 
These measu
res
 have also triggered unprecedented 
fiscal stimulus packages
 intended 
to cushion the economic fallout and to prepare for a swift recovery. As a 
result
, the general government budget 
deficit 
in the euro area 
is 
projected to 
increase
 significantly
, to 8.
5% of GDP 
in 2020, compared 
with
 0.6%
 in 2019
. Although 
the deficit 
ratio is expected to 
shrink
 to 4.
9% in 
2021, 
it 
is 
still 
expected to stand at
 3.8% of GDP 
in 2022, as the drag will 
be longer to fully dissipate
. The extensive 
fiscal measures in 
2020 have led 
to 
a corresponding
 worsening of the cyclically adjusted primary 
balance
, 
in addition to
 a negative cyclical component
 reflecting the 
deterioration in the 
macroeconomic situation
. The subsequent improvement is expected to be led by 
the 
phasing out of the emergency measures and 
the
 corresponding 
strengthening of the
 cyclically adjusted primary balance
, 
while the 
economic 
cycle improve
s more slowly.
 Euro area countries have 
also provided 
envelopes of loan guarantees amounting to 
almost 20
% of GDP 
in order 
to bolster
 firms™ 
liquidity.
 While these guarantees 
will 
not 
necessarily 
affect deficit
s ex ante, they
 do constitute a significant contingent liability 
that could negatively affect 
deficits
 if 
they are called
 on. 
Reflecting the fiscal measures 
and the deteriorating economic situation, the euro area aggregate debt ratio is 
projected to rise steeply in 2020 and remain at 
an elevated level through
out 2022. An 
ambitious and coordinated
 fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp 
contraction in
 the euro area economy
, 
although measures should be targeted and 
temporary
. 
In this respect, both the •540 billion package of three safety nets endorsed 
by the European Council
 and the European Commission™s proposal for a recovery 
plan dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors most severely hit by the 

pandemic
 are strongly welcomed.
 In the 
June
 2020 Eurosystem
 staff projections
, the euro area general 
government budget 
balance
 is projected to 
decline 
strongly
 in 2020, 
but
 to 
partly recover 
in 
2021 and 
2022.17 Based on
 these projections, the general 
government deficit ratio for the euro area is expected to increase 
from 
a 0.6% of GDP 
in 201
9 to 
8.5
% of GDP 
in 
2020 and 
then 
to shrink to
 4.9
% and 3.
8% in 2021 and 2022
 respectively
 (see Chart 2
6).The decline
 in the budget balance in 2020
 is 
attributable 
mainly 
to a 
deterioration in the cyclically adjusted primary 
balance 
on the back of 
economic support measures amounting to around 3.5% of GDP, of which the 
largest 
part is additional spending, particular
ly in the form of employment aid 
schemes, 
support measures to firms and households
, a
nd higher health
 spending. 
It is also 
the
 result of 
a large and negative cyclical component
 as the euro area economy 
slips into
 recession
.18 The subsequent improvement 
is exp
ected to 
be 
driven 
by a 
recovery in 
the 
cyclically adjusted primary balance

 In

 more 
adverse

 in 2020

3 
percentage points
 in 2021 and 2022

are
 attributable mainly to
 a lower primary balance 
and
 a weaker
 than
 expected cyclical 
component, while the interest expenditure component has been 
revised up
, but
 only 
by 
a much smaller extent.
 The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to 
be strongly 
accommodative
 in 
2020, 
but
 contractionary in 
2021 as most support measures 
are expected to have been phased out
 by then
.19 The fiscal stance is estimated 
to 
have been mildly expansionary in 2019
, 
but 
is expected to be highly accommodative 
19  The fiscal stance reflects the direction and size of the stimulus from fiscal policies to the economy, 
beyond the a
utomatic reaction of public finances to the business cycle. It is measured here as the change 
in the cyclically adjusted primary balance ratio net of government support to the financial sector. For more

Notwithstanding the negative fiscal stance in 2021, it should be pointed out that the overall fiscal balance will remain substantially negative with fiscal instruments continuing to support the economic recovery, not least through automatic

 The lockdown measures adopted to contain the

on euro area trade in services
, in 
particular on travel and passenger transportation
. Exports of services dropped by

3.3
% in March 2020

 Among 
several heterogeneous sectors, those involving physical contact are 
severely
 affected

 that tourism and leisure
 services
 and transport services are the sectors with the sharpest decline in activity

 Travel and tourism as part of euro area trade in services
 Tourism is travel for leisure or business and involves several 
stages and 
components, such as 
travel planning, transport, accommodation, food and 
shopping, local travel and tourist sites.
21 International tourism
 enters
 a country
™s balance of payments
 as exp
orts and imports of travel and transportation services
. According to 
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual 
(BPM6)
, ﬁ[t]ravel covers primarily the goods and services acquired from an economy 
by travellers (–) during visits of less
 than one year in that economy
ﬂ and excludes
 the 
international carriage of travellers, which is covered in passenger services under 
transportation.

he concepts of travel and tourism, see the sixth edition of the 
Balance of Payments and 
International Investment Position Manual
 (BPM6) and the 
International Recommendations for Tourism 
Statistics by the United Nations World Tourism Organization
 (UNWTO). While travel (as defined in 
BPM6) and tourism (as defined by the UNWTO) largely overlap, the stati
stical concepts differ in two 
dimensions. First, ﬁtravelﬂ includes purchases by short
-term cross
-border workers, which are not 
considered tourism expenditure. Second, tourism includes purchases of (international) passenger 
transport services, which fall un
der transport rather than travel
 services
 according to BPM6.

amounted to •988 billion, of which 
•124 billion from trade in travel services, 
accounting for 17% of the total amount. The t
ransport
 sector accounts for 16% and 
includes both freight and passenger transportation, with the latter
 accounting
 for 23% 
of exports and 15% of imports in 2019
. 
Imports amounted to •920 billion, with 
transport (16%) and travel (13%) being the largest categories
. 
The euro area is exposed to trade in heavily affected 
service
 sectors
, in which it 
recorded a surplus in 2019
. The geographical breakdown of services trade balances 
(see Chart A) illustrates the categories for euro area in services by main trade 
partners. The euro area had an overall surplus in trade in travel services, which
 is 
particularly exposed as the sector is among the most affected. The United Kingdom, 
Switzerland and the United States accounted for the largest contributions to the trade 
in travel surplus in 2019. Other sectors such as insurance, pensions and financial
 services as well as telecommunication, computers and information services trade are 
less affected.

options prices
 Prepared by Miguel Ampudia, Ursel Baumann and Fabio Fornari
 Introduction
 Stock markets around the world have tumbled since 
late February, when 
international investors began to worry about the spread of the coronavirus 
outside of China and its impact on the global economy.
 Although equity markets 
have partially recovered since then, the Euro Stoxx 50 lost 12.3% in the week endi
ng 
on 28 February, its largest weekly percentage loss since the global financial crisis in 
2008. The S&P 500 declined by more than 11% in an equally catastrophic week. 
Overall, equity markets in the euro area and the United States lost around 35% of their 
value between their peak on 19 February and their trough on 23 March.

 Notes: Model
-based estimates of the standard deviation of daily equi
ty returns for four indices: the Euro Stoxx 50, the S&P 500, the 
FTSE 100 and the Nikkei 225. Daily data. The latest observations are for 13 April 2020.
 The decline in equity prices has led to a large spike in the variance of their 
returns.
 The standard de
viation of daily equity returns of major indices in the euro 
area, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan is at levels comparable to the 
peaks associated with the October 1987 stock market crash and the default of 
Lehman Brothers in September 2008
 (see Chart A). Recent turbulence has clearly 
been global in nature, as shown by the substantial jump in the standard deviation 
across indices. This is also reflected in a sharp rise, to values close to unity, in the 
bilateral correlations of equity return
s for the four main equity indices, which highlights 
the presence of a common factor among these returns. The resulting lack of 
diversification opportunities also amplifies the potential losses faced by international 
investors.

 Coronavirus
 (COVID
-19): market fear as implied by options prices
  52 The increased risk aversion 
that came on top of the heightened risks may have 
amplified the sell
-off in equity markets and across a large range of assets more 
generally.
 Following the initial large sell
-off in financial markets, an important question 
for policymakers when assessing t
he response to the crisis concerns the persistence 
of the impact of the restrictions related to the coronavirus on financial risk, financial 
conditions and, ultimately, on real economic activity. One of the main ways in which 
this shock has spread is via f
inancial market linkages and, most notably, via the 
synchronous plunge in global stock markets. The sell
-off may have been driven by an 
increase in the perceived amount of risk present in the markets, an increase in the 
reluctance of investors to take risk
s, or a combination of both. Knowing the main 
source of the decline in equity prices (and financial assets in general) may help 
policymakers understand its persistence and evaluate the policy response. The aim of 
this box is to assess the changes in the qu
antity and price of (tail) risks using an 
estimate of tail risk aversion based on the price of equity options.
 Risk
-neutral densities
 The risk
-neutral density of an equity price is the market™s estimate of the 
probability distribution for the future level 
of that equity price, adjusted for the 
presence of investors™ risk aversion.
 The risk
-neutral density therefore reflects both 
the risk attitudes and price expectations of investors. Risk
-neutral densities can be 
thought of as physical densities whose shape
 has been modified in order to give more 
prominence to those states of the world that are associated with particularly adverse 
outcomes and that, as such, result in lower marginal utility for investors.
28 We derive 
the risk
-neutral density of future returns
 from the daily prices of call and put options 
traded on the Euro Stoxx 50.
29 On any given day, these options are available for more 
than one maturity, making it possible to estimate the risk
-neutral density for the 
available range of maturities.
 Fears of a
 market crash emerged in the early stages of the virus outbreak in 
Europe, but after the announcement of significant policy stimulus the expected 
upside potential for equity prices increased, even though market risks 
remained elevated.
 Chart B shows the Eu
ro Stoxx 50 risk
-neutral density for equity 
returns, backed out from options and spanning a horizon of up to one year, on three 
dates: (i) 21 February, just before the virus outbreak reached Europe in full force; (ii) a 
week later (28 February); and (iii) 
20 March, after significant policy stimulus had been 
announced in the euro area and the United States. One can already observe a marked 
increase in the variance 
Œ as well as a fattening of the left tail 
Œ of the distribution in the 
                                        
                           
 28  Such modification results in investors being risk
-neutral in the sense
 that all future cash flows from any 
asset can be discounted using risk
-free rates.

30 By 
20 March, after significant monetary and fiscal policy measures had been announced 
and equity markets had already fallen sharply, the lower tail of the risk
-neutral density 
remained broadly unchang
ed, but the distribution became more skewed to the upside, 
suggesting an increase in the expected recovery of equity returns.

 Note: Risk
-neutral densities of future returns backed out from the daily prices of call and put options traded on the Euro Stoxx 50.
 A tail risk aversion indicator
 An indicator of investor risk preferences 
or risk aversion can be derived by 
comparing the risk
-neutral density with an estimate of the physical density of 
equity returns.
 The risk
-neutral and the physical densities are related to each other 
through the pricing kernel, which embeds investors™ risk
 preferences. The physical 
density represents investors™ best judgement about probabilities of future price 
developments. Expectations of physical densities cannot be determined from market 
prices, as market prices also embed the risk preferences of invest
ors. Researchers 
have turned to statistical methods to estimate such densities.
32 We use a daily 
                                        
                           
 30  The large increase in variance, with investors pricing 
in a higher likelihood of both tails
, overshadowed 
the increase in 
skew
ness.
 31  A similar picture emerges for equity returns 
backed out from options maturing 
at short horizons, i.e. with 
a residual 
life of 10 to 20 days.

  54 multivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) 
model to achieve this.
33 The tail risk aversion indicator is constructed by compar
ing the left tails of the 
risk
-neutral and physical distributions.
 Investors are risk
-averse if they attach a 
higher risk
-neutral probability to adverse events compared with the physical density. 
As tail risk
-averse investors are willing to pay a premium t
o insure against the disutility 
associated with adverse outcomes, risk
-neutral probabilities will overstate the 
corresponding physical probabilities for negative tail events. We look at the behaviour 
of the left tails of both the risk
-neutral and the physi
cal densities for equity returns over 
a three
-month horizon. The index of aversion to negative tail risk of investors is 
calculated as the area to the left of the point on the risk
-neutral density that 
corresponds to the lowest tenth percentile of the phys
ical distribution of the returns 
(normalised by 0.1, i.e. the corresponding area on the physical density).
34 A tail risk 
aversion index above one indicates that investors fear the materialisation of negative 
tail events and are therefore willing to insure a
gainst such an occurrence by paying 
more than would be justified by its historical likelihood.
35 By contrast, an index value 
between zero and one could be considered as consistent with a situation in which 
appetite for risk is high.
                                         
                           
 33  GARCH models account for 
the volatility clustering commonly observed in financial assets™ returns 
series, especially in periods of stress.
 At each date, we simulate a number of future paths of equity 
returns using this model, up to the maturity of the longest option traded that da
y in the market. From these 
returns, for a given maturity, we build their future physical density via kernel estimation.
 We estimate the 
expected physical density of equity returns by simulating their first and second moments using the full 
historical erro
rs of the standardised residuals obtained by scaling the rates of change of an equity index 
with their conditional standard deviation based on the GARCH model. As this may overstate the variance 
of the errors in the presence of policy stimulus, an alternat
ive would be to give more weight to errors 
recorded in the initial phase of the asset purchase programme in 2015 or to reduce the variance of the 
errors to mimic a decline in expected risks.
 34  The procedure is as follows: (i) determine the return associat
ed with the lowest tenth percentile in the 
physical distribution, (ii) look up this return in the risk neutral distribution and calculate the area to its left, 
and (iii) divide this area by 0.1 (which represents the area to the left of the tenth percentile
 in the physical 
distribution).
 35  When the indicator is below one, investors are still willing to insure against the materialisation of negative 
tail events, but only at a lower price than that inferred from the historical likelihood.

 The estimated t
ail risk aversion increased measurably from the second half of 
February. In mid
-March, coinciding with the introduction of policy measures on 
both sides of the Atlantic, it reversed its course and returned to early
-February 
levels.
 Chart C depicts the esti
mated tail risk indicator, along with a measure of tail 
risk, defined as the (inverted) tenth percentile of the physical distribution of the Euro 
Stoxx 50 returns. Initially, as the coronavirus was largely contained to certain regions 
in China, markets app
ear to have been rather complacent in the sense that there was 
practically no increase in tail risk aversion. At the outbreak of the pandemic in Europe, 
however, investors™ willingness to take on risk declined measurably, as reflected in the 
increase in th
e tail risk aversion index as of 21 February 
Œ the start of the lockdown in 
some parts of the Italian region of Lombardy. Around mid
-March, the price of left tail 
risk started to decline again, as a cascade of fiscal and monetary policy measures was 
announ
ced on both sides of the Atlantic. By contrast, tail risk itself remained broadly 
stable until the beginning of March, started to rise significantly thereafter and remained 
elevated even after the introduction of policy stimulus. One interpretation of thes
e developments is that the measures put into place by central banks and governments 
have been able to support investors™ risk appetite, thus curbing the initial rise in the 
price of risk and leading it back to the value prevailing around mid
-February. This
 reduction in the price of risk took place despite the rise in the amount of risk and 
therefore contributed significantly to minimising the impact of the shock on financial 
markets.

economic growth globally.
 The latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) documents a 
deterioration in the business activity of small and medium
-sized enterprises 
(SMEs) i
n the 
reporting 
period 
from
 October 2019 to Marc
h 2020.
36 As the survey 
was conducted between 2 March and 8 April, firms 
were able to 
account
 for 
the impact 
of the ongoing crisis
 to some extent
. However, the survey results with regard to the 
backward
-looking questions 
may only show some partial effects o
f the crisis, 
as the 
reporting period 
had almost come to an end 
before the escalation of the crisis.
 Looking 
backwards
, euro area SMEs signalled a decline in turnover for the first 
time since the beginning of 2014.
 In net percentage terms,
37 the reported change in 
turnover was 
-2% (down 
from 20%
 in the previous round
) for the euro area as a whole 
(see 
Chart A
). Notwithstanding some differences across countries, t
he deterioration 
was widespread
. The sharpest declines were experienced
 in Italy,
 followed by 
Slovakia, Greece and Spain
, while i
n Germany 
and 
France 
a much smaller 
percentage of SMEs indicated
, on balance
, an 
increas
e in
 turnover
.                                         
                           
 36  The 22nd SAFE round was conducted between 2 March and 8 April 2020 and covered the period from 
October 2019 to March 2020. The total euro area sample size was 11,236 enterprises, of which 10,287 
(92%) had fe
wer than 250 employees. For a more comprehensive overview of the latest results, see
 Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises

entitled ﬁAccess to finance for small and medium
-sized enterprises since the financial crisis: evidence 
from survey dataﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin provides additional evidence of survey results 
over the last 
ten years.

reporting 
an increase 
for a given factor 
and the percentage reporting

 The net 
percentage is the difference between the percenta
ge of enterprises reporting an increase for a given factor and the percentage reporting 
a decrease.
 SMEs™ profitability also weakened across countries and economic sectors.
 Amid 
deteriorating turnover,
 high labour 
(reported by 46% of firms 
in net terms
) and other 
input costs 
(45%) 
took a toll 
on SMEs™ 
profits 
across the euro area 
(-15%, from 
-1%)
, despite
 accommodative financing conditions
. The decline in profits was particularly 
strong 
among Greek, Spanish, Italian and
 Slovakia
n SMEs
. At 
the 
sectoral level, 
industry appears to 
have 
been the 
worst hit
 by the deterioration in profits (
-20%, from 
-7%), notably in Italy. In the trade sector
, a net 19% of euro area SMEs also reported 
decreasing profits, with the percentage reaching
 37% in Italy and
 30% in Spain.
 A weakening 
financial 
position 
and 
a deteriorating 
macroeconomic 
environment raised concerns about 
access to financ
e among SMEs.
 The 
deterioration 
in turnover
 and 
in 
profit
s among euro area SMEs was seen as an 
impediment to
 obtaining
 externa
l finance (
-18%, from 5%)
 for the first time since 
September 2014
, particularly among Spanish,
 Italian and Portuguese
 SMEs
. In 
addition, S
MEs 
also 
perceived development
s in the general economic outlook to have 
negatively affected access to finance (
-30%, from 
-13%), a percentage not seen since 
March 2013. The deterioration was w
idespread across countries 
Œ particularly 
in 
Germany
, Italy and 
Finland 
Œ and sectors, with industry at 
-31%, construction 
at -21%, service
s at -31%, and 
trade 
at -30%.
 Moreover, com
pared with larger companies, 
SMEs, and micro firms in particular, appeared to be more concerned about the 
adverse impact that their own sales and profit outlook would have on their access to 
external finance.
 Firms™ 
expectations
 for access to finance in the near future 
shed 
more 
light on 
the severity of the COVID
-19 crisis
. The 
declaration of a pandemic by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March and the subsequent 
intensification of 
confinement measures in the euro area l
argely coincided with the latest 
round of 
SAFE 
fieldwork

 The
 COVID
-19 pandemic and access to finance for small and medium
-sized enterprises: 
evidence from survey dat
a  58 the survey capture
d the ongoing and anti
cipated worsening of the economic 
conditions.
 Focusing on the daily responses, e
xpectations in the euro area started 
deteriorating 
rapidly
 shortly
 after the 
WHO 
declared a pandemic, 
which was 
followed by lockdowns and border controls
 across much of Europe
. The reporting dates of firms 
surveyed 
during the fieldwork 
were
 used 
to analyse the 
change in firms™
 expectations since the outbreak of the pandemic.
38 On the day of the 
WHO announcement, 17% of firms
, on average,
 were expecting a deterioration in the 
avai
lability of bank loans and credit lines, 
with
 20% 
expecting the same 
for trade credit 
(see Chart B). By the 
time
 the ECB 
pandemic 
emergency 
purchase 
programme 
(PEPP) was announced on 18 March, the respective percentages were already at 
41% for bank loans, 
43% for credit lines and 46% for trade credit.
 Chart B
 Enterprises expecting a deterioration in the availability of external finance over the

 (estimated percentages)

 Note
s: Estimated percentages 
refer to time fixed effects of a weighted least
 squares logistic regression controlling for time and country 
fixed effects. The last three observations (6
-8 April) refer to a sub
-sample of countries (Germany,
 Greece,
 Spain, France and
 Slovakia) 
as the interviews in the remaining countries were concluded by 3 April.
 The deterioration 
in the 
expect
ed access to finance 
appear
ed to level off after 
the PE
PP announcement
, at least 
with regard to
 bank loans and credit lines.
 Although 
it is not possible to infer 
the
 direct impact of the 
PEPP
 announcement on 
firms™ expectations, there seems to have been some mitigation 
of their
 pessimistic 
view 
of 
banking products
 starting from that date
. By contrast, the deterioration of 
expectation
s regarding 
trade credit availability continued for somewhat longer, mostly 
reflecting the strains in supply relationships with expected delays in obtaining 
payables due to the crisis.
 Firms™
 expectation
s about
 the availability of financing over the next six m
onths 
recorded a very sharp deterioration compared with
 the positive 
trend recorded

the single country effects to take into account 
the different degrees of emergency across countries.

Base is f

refer to rounds 1 (April
-September 2009) to 22 (October 
2019-March 2020) of the survey.
 On internal financing sources, 
SMEs reported a substantial net decline in 
the 
expected availability of funds 
(-17%
, from 12%
). This is likely to reflect anticipated 
hea
dwinds 
for 
econom
ic activity
, which has major implications for firms™ profitability. 
With the exception of the Netherlands
, the deterioration is 
widespread across
 countries
, with the 
highest percentages recorded in 
Portugal (
-26%), France (
-23%) 
and Italy
 (-21%). 
Overall
, the 
deterioration
 in the availability of internal funds is more 
substantial than the lowest point indicated during
 the sovereign debt crisis (April
 to 
September 2012)
, when 
9% of SMEs reported a 
decline.
 Expected availability of external 
financing sources 
also 
registered a 
deterioration, 
although less than that of internal financing
. Euro area SMEs 
reported net declines 
(-11%
) for bank
-related products, namely bank loans, credit lines 
and bank overdrafts. The relatively 
smaller deteriorati
on compared 
to internal funds 
may reflect
 the
 positive effects of accommodative monetary policy measures
 and of 
the various government programmes that have been announced since the start of the 
pandemic.
 As for trade credit, 
SMEs on balance 
expect
 a significant reduction (
-20%)
, which may point to 
the 
expected interruptions of regular business operations, 
in turn 
affecting relations between firms. The strongest declines
 in 
the expected availability of 
external financing
 were reported among SMEs from 
Spain, 
Italy, 
Portugal and 
Slovakia.
 The decline 
in future access to bank loans was still more limited than in 
2012, when a net 
15% of SMEs reported a deterioration in expected availability
. For 
trade credit, however, the deterioration is already slightly m
ore acute 
than in th
e previous crisis in 2012, when a net 17% expected a reduction.
                                          
                           
 39  Firms from the service sector appear to be the most pessimistic 
of all, possibly reflecting particularly 
adverse effects of lockdown measures on them. R
egarding the size of entities, micro firms are the most 
affected, according to the survey, with large firms reporting deterioration
 to a lesser extent.

Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the 
period from 
29 January 
to 5 May 2020
 Prepared by Svetla Daskalova and Marco Weißler
 This box describes the ECB™s
 monetary policy operations during the first 
two 
reserve maintenance period
s 
of 2020, which ran from 29 January to 5 May
. As a 
response to the coronavirus (COVID
-19) crisis and in view of heightened financial 
market volatility, the Eurosystem decided on a set of measures to ease funding 
conditions and liquidity availability across sectors and jurisdictions during the two 
maintenance periods under review.
 As part of the COVID
-19-related policy measures on the liquidity providing side, 
the Eurosystem announce
d amendments to 
the existing targeted 
long
er-term 
refinancing operations (TLTRO III)
 and introduced a series of 
additional tender 
operation
s as well as a broad set of collateral easing measures
 for Eurosystem 
counterparties
. On 12 March the easing of conditions for the TLTRO III and a new 
series of additional longer
-term refinancing operations (additional LTROs) were 
introduced 
to provide immediate liquidity support to banks and to safeguard money 
market conditions. These measures aimed to serve as a backstop facility during the 
recent turbulence. 
The
 additional 
LTROs 
are conducted on a weekly basis and will 
mature on 24 June 2020, effectively bridging
 the period until the 
fourth 
TLTRO III 
operation 
is settled.
40 On the asset purchase side, further
 to the temporary
 envelop
e 
of •120 billion 
of 
net asset purchases
 under the asset purchase programme (APP) 
agreed
 on 12 
March,
 o
n 18 March the ECB announced a new 
pandemic 
emergency 
purchase 
programme (PEPP) with a volume of •750 billion to last at least until the end of 
2020. These additional purchases are intended to counter the risks to the monetary 
policy transmission mechanism
 in the euro area stemming from the COVID
-19 crisis. 
These purchases will be conducted in a flexible manner
 and can be expanded if the 
crisis phase extends past the end of the year.
41 In order to further improve funding conditions in the global US dollar funding 
market, the Eurosystem, in coordination with the Federal Reserve, Bank of 

England, Bank of Japan, Ban
k of Canada and Swiss National Bank, enhanced 
the provision of US dollar liquidity via th
e existing US dollar swap lines
. Furthermore, the ECB set up euro
-providing swap lines with a number of EU central 
banks. 
The coordinated action enhancing the existing
 provision of US dollar liquidity 
was announced on 15 March, reducing the pricing of US dollar liquidity and 

introducing an additional US dollar operation with a maturity of 84 days. Furthermore, 

as of 20 March, the frequency of the 
seven
-day US
-dollar
-pro
viding operations was 
40  
Subsequently, on 30 April, additional recalibrations of the targeted 
longer
-term refinancing 
operatio
ns 
(TLTRO III) and new pandemic emergency longer
-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) were 
introduced to further support 
the 
real economy and smooth money market conditions. Both measures will 
only 
affect liquidity provision as of the third maintenance period of 2020.
 41  In fact, the 
ECB 
Governing Council decided on 4 June to expand the size of the PEPP by 
•600 billion, 
and to 
extend the horizon 
until 
at 
least the end of June 2021.

 Liquidity
 conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 29 January to 5 May 
2020
 61 increased from weekly to daily. Th
ese measures helped to significantly ease funding 
conditions in the US dollar funding markets.
 Liquidity needs
 The average daily liquidity needs of the banking system, defined as the sum of 
net 
autonomous factors and reserve requirements, stood at •
1,613.4 
billion in 
the period under review
 (see the section of Table A entitled ﬁOther 
liquidity
-based informationﬂ)
. This was •
107.7
 billion 
higher
 than in the previous 
review period (i.e. the 
last tw
o maintenance periods
 of 2019). Net autonomous factors 
increased
 by •
106.3 
billion
 to •1477.8 billion, while minimum reserve requirements 
increased by •1.4 billion to •135.7
 billion.
 The main drivers of liquidity in the first 
two 
maintenance period
s 
of 2020 were
 increasing government deposits, demand
 for banknotes, asset purchases and 
the new series of additional LTROs
. Liquidity absorption by autonomous factors 
increased by
 •
106.3
 billion,
 on average, mainly driven by an exceptional increase in 
government 
deposits of •101.7 billion due to prudent government cash management 
in view of COVID
-19. 
Against the same background, a higher
 demand for
 banknotes 
contributed to further liquidity absorption
 of 
•27.7
 billion, as the post
-year
-end 
seasonal decrease in banknote holdings during the first maintenance period was 

outweighed by the increase in the second maintenance period. The developments in 
autonomous factors on the asset side, however, with a net increase of •23.7 billion, 
had a mild counter effect. Net assets denominated in euro
 decreased
 by •
51.9 billion, 
whereas net foreign assets increased by •75.6
 billion and partially compensated for 
the liquidity absorption 
by government deposits and banknotes. The dynamics on the 
asset side during the second maintenance period
 were mainly a result of the higher 
demand in the US
-dollar
-providing operations, with a total outstanding amount of •142 
billion by the end of the second maintenance period of 2020.

 Liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments
 The average amount of liquidity provided through open market operations

•195 billion to

 The overall 
reported increase 
in 
excess liquidity in the first two maintenance periods of 2020 was driven in similar 
amounts by tender operations and the outright purchases of the Eurosystem. The 
main sources of this 
additional liquidity were the additional LTROs as well as asset 
purchases under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and the new PEPP.

 This box examines regional developments in labour input within the euro area 
from 2007, the peak in economic a
ctivity before the global financial crisis, until 
2018. It uses the regional labour market indicators available from the Annual Regional 
Database of the European Commission (ARDECO).
42 For the purposes of 
comparison, we divide regions into four distinct gro
ups (or quartiles) according to the 
2007 GDP per capita distribution in each country (see Figure A). These groups are 
fixed over time.

  68 By 2018 total hours worked had recovered to their pre
-crisis levels only in those 
regions at the top of the GDP per capita distribution, while in the remaining 
regions t
hey still stood below their 2007 levels.
43 The response of total hours 
worked was asymmetric over the 2007
-18 period, with employment in regions in the 
bottom 25% showing stronger losses
 during the recession period than the gains 
recorded during the subsequ
ent recovery 
(see Chart 
A).44 Between 2007 and 2018 
total hours worked declined by 5.6% in the regions in the bottom quartile, while they 
increased by 3.2% in the top quartile regions. In the two middle quartiles, total hours 
worked show a similar profile t
o the euro area aggregate and by 2018 had returned to 
levels close to those observed in 2007. As a result, the share of total hours worked in 
the regions in the top quartile increased by 1.4 percentage points (from 38.7% in 2007 
to 40.1% in 2018), while th
e share of the regions in the bottom quartile decreased by 
1.2 percentage points (from 23.2% in 2007 to 22% in 2018).

re

 The smaller decline in total hours worked in the richer regions during the 
downturn, as well as the relatively homogeneous developments across regions 
during the recovery, can be attributed to changes in the employment rate, to the 
decline in average hour
s worked during the recession period, and to regional 
differences in population growth during both periods consistent with labour 
migrating from poorer to richer regions.

 43  The results are not driven by the assignment of regions to the different quartiles of their within
-country 
GDP per capita distribution in 2007, as the results of the analysis described in this box still hold 
whe
n regions are grouped by the euro area GDP per capita distribution in 2007, or when a single country is 
removed from the analysis.
 44  During the contraction phase (2007
-13), the average annual growth rate of total hours worked stood at 
-0.5% for the top 25
% regions, 
-0.8% for the regions in the above median group, 
-1.1% for the regions 
below the median, and 
-1.8% for the regions in the bottom 25% group. For the euro area as a whole, the 
average annual decline in total hours worked between 2007 and 2013 stoo
d at 
-0.97%. The pace of 
increase in total hours worked during the recovery period was faster in the regions in the top 25% group

 Regional
 labour market developments during the great financial crisis and subsequent 
recovery
  69 contributed to the dynamics in total hours work
ed across the four regional groups.
45 The employment rate is quantitatively the most important driver of the changes in total 
hours worked, accounting for more than 50% 
Œ in all regional groups 
Œ of both the 
decline in total hours worked during the recessio
n period and the increase in total 
hours worked during the recovery period. The highest contribution came during the 
recovery period in the regions in the bottom 25%. The decline in average hours 
worked was also an important driver of the decline in total 
hours worked during the 
recession period across all regions, while its region
-wide stabilisation after 2013 
limited its impact during the recovery period. The employment rate and average hours 
worked channels moved in qualitatively similar ways across all 
regional groups. 
Developments in labour force participation and in population growth contributed more 
strongly to the growth of total hours worked in richer regions than they did in poorer 
regions. Population growth increased monotonically with the distrib
ution of GDP per 
capita, with average annualised growth rates spanning from 0.1% for the regions in 
the bottom 25% to 0.5% for regions in the top 25%, while the differences in population 
growth across regions sharpened during the recovery phase. Finally, c
hanges in the 
labour force participation rate mirrored those in population growth, albeit their 
contribution was quantitatively smaller across both periods. These patterns are 
consistent with the existence of migration flows from poorer to richer regions, 
with both 
population and labour force participation increasing in richer regions at the expense of 
poorer ones. On the other hand, migration flows contribute to an initial upturn in the 
employment rate and in average hours worked in poorer regions, while t
he impact of 
migration on employment and hours worked in richer regions can be either mitigated 
or enhanced by demand
-side factors.

 Regional
 labour market developments during the great financial crisis and subsequent 
recovery
  70 The widening gap in the compensation of employees between regions is mostly 
driven by the regional dispersion of the long
-term changes in total hours 
worked, with the growth rates of compensation per hour work
ed being broadly 
comparable across regions (see Table A).
 The share of compensation of 
employees in the regions in the top 25% increased by 0.7 percentage points between 
2007 and 2018, from 45.2% in 2007 to 45.9% in 2018. In the regions in the bottom 
25%, 
the share decreased by roughly 0.9 percentage points over the same period, 
from 18.1% in 2007 to 17.2% in 2018. However, the widening gap in compensation of 
employees across regions stems mostly from 
regional developments in labour input
. The growth rate o
f compensation per hour worked is
 in fact 
comparable across 
regions, 
and during the contraction period was even lower for the regions in the richest 
25% than for the remaining regions. This development may be explained by the fact 
that labour supply increa
sed in rich regions as a result of migration flows both from 
poorer to richer regions and from outside the euro area. The similar rate of increase in 
compensation per hour worked across regions may be related to the strong increase 
in labour supply in rich
er regions and to the mitigation of the decline in average hours 
worked in the remaining regions during the contraction period. The developments in 
compensation per hour worked may also be related to the country and industrial 
composition of the groups of 
regions and, therefore, to the impact of labour market 
policies in place during the great financial crisis and subsequent recovery, such as 
short
-time working schemes and wage
-bargaining agreements.

 Overall, the 
evolution of
 total hours worked in the euro area between 2007 and 
2018 was very
 heterogeneous across regions
, with richer regions 
being more 
insulated during the recession period and poorer regions not fully catching up 
during the recovery period.
 These differing patterns across regions can be 
attributed 
to changes in the employment rate, to the decline in average hours worked 
during
 the recession period, and to the stability of regional differences in population 
growth d
uring both the recession and recovery periods. Migration from poorer to richer 
                                        
                           
 46  Short
-time working
 schemes may have influenced the increase in compensation per hour worked by 
allowing for greater flexibility in the decline of average hours worked by employees during the contraction 
period while protecting workers™ pay during the same period. At the sam
e time, national wage bargaining 
agreements may also partly explain the stronger wage per hour growth performance seen in the bottom 
two quartiles by comparison with regions in the top two quartiles.

 Prepared by António Dias da Silva, Maarten Dossche, Ferdinand Dreher, 
Claudia Foroni and Gerrit Koester
 Short
-time work and temporary lay
-offs are 
key instruments for cushioning the 
economic impact of the coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic.
 Various euro area 
countries have implemented or rev
ised
 their short
-time work
 or 
temporary lay
-off
 schemes
47 in order
 to limit
 households™ loss of 
income and 
firms™ 
wage costs.
48 These 
schemes
 also 
support
 the 
economic 
recovery
: they preserve employment 
relationships 
so that
 the 
workers are
 available 
and the firms ready 
to resume activity 
once
 lockdown measures are lifted.
 There is substantial evidence that these suppo
rt 
schemes considerably dampen employment losses in the euro area, compared to 
countries where such schemes are either scarce (e.g. the United States) or 
non
-existent.
49 Such schemes
 are designed to bridge temporary shortfalls in activity 
and demand and nee
d to be balanced with the need for 
economic restructuring and 
employment reallocation
 within and
 across sectors.
 This box estimates take
-up rates and calculates wage replacement rates for the 
schemes in the five largest countries in the euro area.
 These ec
onomies account 
for more than 80% of the euro area
-wide compensation of employees
. Combining 
wage replacement rates with the number of participants 
makes it possible to
 calculat
e the impact of short
-time work on household disposable income
 during the pande
mic
. Understanding the 
effects
 of current and planned short
-time work and temporary 
lay
-off schemes is important for 
developing
 macroeconomic projections. The
refore the
 impact of the schemes need
s to be monitored as 
and when 
more information becomes 
availa
ble regarding 
actual
 take
-ups
. The effects of sh
ort
-time work 
schemes on income losses vary according to the 
reduction in working time.

the 
minimum reduction in working hours required to receive the benefit.
 Depen
ding on the design of national schemes, their effects on measures of 
compensation per employee and
 on compensation per hour 
can differ 
substantially between euro area countries
. While 
in Germany and Spain 
benefits 
are paid directly to employees, 
in the Net
herlands, France and Italy 
employers 
receive
 a subsidy to finance 
their 
payments to employees. 
In different countries such 
schemes 
may be reflected in statistics in different ways, depending on the classification decided 
upon by Eurostat. If
 the 
benefits 
are paid directly to employees and recorded as social 
transfers
, while wages and salaries decrease 
in relation
 to the number of hours 
worked
, these schemes may show as a strong downward shift in compensation per 
employee.
 By contrast, in countries where a
 scheme is based on a subsidy
 paid
 to 
employers, 
who 
continue to pay full salaries 
for
 a reduced 
number of hours worked
, the schemes may imply a higher compensation per hour.
 In all 
five of the largest euro area
 countries 
it is likely that 
a substantial sha
re of 
employees is 
on short
-time work 
or temporary lay
-off
. Preliminary estimates
 (Chart B)
 based on different sources suggest there may be 
about 10 million 
employees covered by these schemes in Germany (24% of employees) and
 about 12 
million
 in France (
47% of employees). The 
equivalent 
number
s are estimated to be 
8.5 million in Italy (4
4% of employees), 3.9 million in Spain (23% of employees) and 1.7 
million in the Netherlands (21% of employees)
. As official 
data for some of these 
countries
 have yet
 to be 
released these figures should be 
viewed
 with caution
. Here 
they are used for illustrative purposes to gauge the income effects of the measures
. Moreover, the figures are likely to be an upper bound, reflecting take
-up rates during

 The

 Not only has the number of recipients been changing rapidly, but the 
precise reduction in the number of hours worked per recipient also remains unknown. 
To assess the 
importance of short

income, Chart C presents two illustrations showing a high impact period (applicable 
during
 the lockdowns) and a low impact period (with relatively less stringent 
containment measures
 applicab

 the 
lockdowns
) based on calculations for the 
five largest euro area countries. Overall, the characteristics of these two periods are in 
line with the

strict lockdown

euro area 
households™ labour income from reduced hours worked
 could amount to 
-22% during the lockdowns
 (Chart 
C, high impact period

, thanks to 
short
-time work benefits
 the drop 
in net labour income should only
 amount to 
-7%, although 
significant differences 
between
 individuals and 
across 
countries need to be 
acknowledged. As labour income accounts for about 
two
-thirds
 of household 
disposable income, short
-time work schemes 
could
 be expected to provide a buffer of 
about 
10% of household disposable income
 (i.e. abstracting from mixed income 
and 
property income). 
After the end of the lockdowns the low impact period illustrates that 
the loss in 
net labour income 
could diminish to 
-3%, while short
-time work benefits 
rapidly diminish.

 The

  76 7 The COVID
-19 crisis 
and its implications for fiscal policies
 Prepared by 
Stephan Haroutunian, Sebastian Hauptmeier and Nadine 
Leiner
-Killinger
 The coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic has put unprecedented burdens on euro 
area countries™ economies and government finances, which will require a 
strong 
EU response 
in addition to 
action
 at national level.
 On 20 May the 
European Commission released its country
-specific recommendations for economic 
and fiscal policies under the 2020 European Semester.
53 On 27 May it released 
proposals for a recovery fund to support the recovery 
with
 future 
investment
 and 
structural reforms
.54 This box examines how national fiscal policies are being 
coordinated under this year™s European Semester and explains that, in order to ensure 
an even recovery among euro area countries and 
to 
combat fragmentation, sizea
ble 
support 
will be required beyond 
that already provided at national level.
 In response to the dramatic COVID
-19 shock, all euro area countries 
implemented packages of fiscal measures.
 These packages consist of 
discretionary fiscal stimulus measures, stat
e guarantees for loans to firms and other 
liquidity support measures. An important component of the discretionary measures 
relates to support for firms, in particular to preserve employment.
55 Countries have 
also focused on health spending and measures aime
d at 
supporting 
the unemployed 
and other vulnerable groups through various social transfers. On the revenue side, 
deferrals of tax and social security contributions are aimed mainly at providing liquidity 
support to households and companies. According to t
he European Commission™s 
Spring 2020 Economic Forecast
, the 
discretionary fiscal measures amount to 3.25% 
of GDP at the aggregate euro area level. In addition, state guarantees for loans to 
firms and other liquidity support measures amount to around 20% of euro area GDP
, according to governments™ budgetary plans as
 outlined in the stability programmes 
published at the end of April.
56 These plans, however, 
reveal 
large 
differences 
in the 
size of the packages adopted across countries, most notably in the amount of state 
guarantees provided. Such differences raise the r
isk of an uneven recovery in the euro 
area
 and 
fragmentation between euro area economies.
 To facilitate a sufficient immediate response to the exceptional crisis, the 
ECOFIN Council on 23 March activated the Stability and Growth Pact™s general 
escape claus
e. In the event of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or the 
EU as a whole, and provided debt sustainability does not become endangered, the 
triggering of this clause allows countries to depart from the fiscal adjustment 
requirement that would us
ually apply under the EU™s fiscal rules.

 The

  77 Council stressed that the resulting support should be ﬁdesigned, as appropriate, to be 
timely, temporary and targetedﬂ.
 The depth of the COVID
-19 shock and the 
size of the 
fiscal response 
have led 
to 
a drastic deterioration and heterogeneity in fiscal positions.
 According to the 
European Commission™s Spring 2020 Economic Forecast, the euro area budget deficit 
is expected to increase to 8.5% of GDP in 2020 from 0.6% of GDP last year. While 
eleven countrie
s recorded budgetary surpluses in 2019, all euro area countries are 
expected to record budget deficits in excess of the 3% of GDP reference value this 
year. The largest deficits are forecast for Belgium, Spain, France and Italy
, which
 were 
among those 
coun
tries that entered the crisis with high government debt
-to-GDP 
ratios (see Charts A and B). The euro area aggregate debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
rise steeply, by 16.7 percentage points, to 102.7% of GDP in 2020, with large 
heterogeneity across countrie
s. Countries that entered the crisis with debt ratios of 
around 100% will experience the strongest increase
s in indebtedness. Only six euro 
area countries (Estonia, Luxembourg, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovakia) are 
expected to maintain debt ratios bel
ow the 60% of GDP reference value in 2020. In 
2021, under unchanged policies
, government deficit and debt
-to-GDP ratios are 
expected to decline, albeit remaining far above pre
-crisis levels.
 According to the Commission, no euro area country is currently co
mplian
t with 
the Treaty™s government deficit criteri
on and some are also non
-compliant with 
its debt criterion
.58 However, given the exceptionally large uncertainty regarding 
economic developments, ﬁincluding for designing a credible path for fiscal policyﬂ
59, the Commission 
is 
not 
at present 
recommend
ing
 the opening of excessive deficit 
procedures.
 Later in the year
, the Commission will reassess Member States™ 
budgetary situations based on its Autumn 2020 Economic Forecast and euro area 
countries™ draft budg
etary plans for 2021.
 All countries will need to continue supporting their economies to recover from 
the severe shock, while safeguarding medium
-term fiscal sustainability.
 The 
Commission™s recommendations for fiscal policies for 2020
-21 state that countri
es 
should ﬁIn line with the general escape clause, take all necessary measures to 
effectively address the pandemic, sustain the economy and support the ensuing 
recoveryﬂ. Subsequently, ﬁ
When economic conditions allowﬂ, countries are 
recommended to ﬁpursue 
fiscal policies
 aimed at achieving prudent medium
-term 
fiscal positions and ensuring debt sustainability,
 while enhancing investmentﬂ. When 
the severe economic downturn dissipates and before doubts about medium
-term debt 
sustainability arise, use of the Pa
ct™s general escape clause will need to be 
                                        
                           
 58  The European Commission adopted reports under Article 126(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union for all Member States except Romania (see 
Excessive deficit procedures 
Œ overview
). 
These reports assess Member States™ compliance with the deficit criterion in 2020, based on their plans 
or on the European Commission™s Spring 2020 Economic Forecast. In all cases, apart from Bulgaria, 
the 
European Commission concludes that the deficit criterion is not complied with. In addition, the reports for 
Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy and Spain also assess compliance with the debt criterion in 2019 
based on outturn data. For Belgium, Fran
ce and Spain, the Commission concludes that the debt criterion 
is not complied with, while for Cyprus and Greece, its conclusion points to compliance. For Italy, the 
European Commission concludes that there is ﬁno sufficient evidence that the debt criterio
n – is or is not 
complied withﬂ.

 1 Citizens™ attitudes towards the ECB, the euro and 
Economic and Monetary Union
 Prepared by 
Stephanie Bergbauer, Nils Hernborg, Jean
-François Jamet, 
Eric Persson and Hanni Schölermann
 Building on the literature on trust in institutions, the article looks at the state, evolution 
and sociodemographic breakdown of citizens™ trust in the ECB and supp
ort for the 
euro. Drawing on a novel typology of attitudes towards Economic and Monetary Union 
(EMU) and using microdata from Eurobarometer surveys since the introduction of the 
single currency, the analysis tracks the prevalence of supporters and sceptics
 of EMU 
over time and across euro area countries. It further explores the sociodemographic 
characteristics, economic perceptions and, more broadly, European sentiments within 
these groups. In this way, it provides insights into the factors shaping citizens
™ attitudes 
towards the ECB, the euro and EMU, and helps identify possible avenues for 
enhancing trust. The analysis indicates that popular support for EMU 
Œ in particular, 
trust in the ECB 
Œ hinges to a large extent on citizens™ perceptions of their perso
nal 
situation 
and the overall economic 
context
, as well as their broader attitudes towards 
the European Union, while other sociodemographic indicators seem to be less 
relevant.
 1 Introduction
 The financial and sovereign debt crisis brought issues of econom
ic and 
monetary integration to the 
forefront
 of European and national political 
debates
. This article
 explores the 
impact
 of these developments 
on 
public opinion
. To 
this end, it traces developments in
 citizens™
 attitudes towards
 European 
Economic and 
Mone
tary 
Union (EMU) along two central dimen
sions
: citizens™
 support for the euro as 
the most 
tangible
 outcome of economic and monetary integration 
at the European
 level; and 
citizens™
 trust
 in the 
European Central Bank
 (ECB)
 as the institution tasked 
with 
defining and implementing
 monetary policy for the euro area and safeguarding 
the stability o
f the single European currency.
 While the euro and the ECB are 
closely
 linked at the institutional level, public 
opinion towards the two has followed divergent trends 
since the crisis
. Citizens™
 support for the euro remained stable at high levels even at the height of the crisis. 
By contrast, public trust in the ECB 
declined significantly during
 the crisis
 and has since 
been slow to recover
. In autumn 2019 su
pport for t
he euro 
among
 euro area citizens 
stood at
 76%, following
 an almost continuous increase from spring 2016
, while 18% 
of 
respondents in the euro area 
were opposed to the euro
. By contrast, a 
total 
of 
42% of 
euro area respondents 
expressed 
trust 
in 
the ECB,

.63 As a result, net trust in the ECB remains in negative 
territory, while net support for the euro has been increasing steadily since 2013 and 
reached a record high in autumn 2019 (see Chart 1).

B in greater detail.
 Who are the citizens 
who support
 the common currency
, but 
do not have
 confidence in the ECB?
 How do they differ from those citizens who 
support the euro and have trust in the ECB? 
To explore
 these questions, 
we introduce 
a fourfold
 typology
 of attitudes towards EMU b
ased on different combinations of
 citizens™ views on the euro and the ECB. Drawing on survey data from the 
Eurobarometer, we analyse the prevalence of the different groups
 in the general public 
of the euro area from the inception of the common currency in 1999 to 2019.
64 We 
explore variation at euro area EU Member State and regional levels, among different 
sociodemographic groups and based on citizens™ economic perceptions a
nd 
socio
-political orientations.

  82 the central bank
™s ability
 to fulfil its mandate 
facilitates its task of anchoring 
inflation 
expectations, 
increasing
 the effectiveness of the central b
ank™s monetary policy 
measures. Conversely
, a lack of public trust makes the central bank more vulnerable 
to political pressure
, as politicians have greater incentive to make critical comments
 and could undermine its independence
.65 Trust in the 
ECB 
is corr
elated with citizens™ understanding of 
its
 mandate
 and 
affects
 the formation of household
 inflation expectations.
 There is evidence that 
individuals™ inflation expectations are related to their knowledge of the ECB™s policy 
objective and their knowledge of
 how the ECB provides information about its monetary 
policymaking process.
66 Research also
 suggest
s that
 trust in the ECB affects
 the 
formation of household inflation expectations
,67 including when controlling for 
respondents™ knowledge of the ECB™s objectiv
es and their level of financial literacy
.68 Citizens™ support 
provides legitimacy to the project of
 EMU
. Citizens™ support 
provides the necessary legitimacy for 
supranational governance in an area that 
is 
traditionally a core competence of the nation state,
 namely to conduct its own 
monetary policy
. It is important that the 
public 
understands and accepts the ECB™s 
policies 
in order 
to 
reinforce 
its strong political independence.
 Moreover, 
while the 
sustainability of a currency is mostly taken for granted in 
the national context, 
it has 
been argued that,
 as a union of sovereign states
, EMU
 must ultimately rely on a 
ﬁsense of common purpose
ﬂ69 that provides a political bond among members of the 
monetary union beyond standard economic arguments.
70 These political 
bonds 
were
 even more important 
during the global
 financial 
crisis
 that started in 2008,
 when 
membership in the euro area 
was
 framed as creating winners and 
losers, and 
questions regarding the desirability of European economic integration became salient 
in 
national political debates and election campaigns.

 Citizens™
 attitudes towards the ECB, the euro and Economic and Monetary Union
  83 3 A puzzle with four pieces: a typology of attitudes towards 
EMU
 Support for the euro can be conceptualised 
as a reflection of both satisfaction 
with the concrete output of the currency and support for 
the value of economic 
integration.
 Citizens™ perceptions of
 the euro 
are likely to represent both their 
concrete experiences with the currency in day
-to-day life and a more diffuse support of 
the idea of a currency union and 
the value of economic
 and monet
ary integration that 
underpins
 the EMU regime
. In effect, the euro is 
considered 
one of the most visible 
embodiments
 of the EU,
72 and citizens™ support for the value of European integration 
is positively related to support for the euro.
73 Trust in the ECB 
represents
 a form of institutional trust, reflecting 
a positive 
perception of 
the central bank and its specific policies.
 The most concrete output 
and obvious yardstick for assessing the ECB™s performance is the inflation rate as a 
measure of price stability
, which is 
the ECB™s primary objective 
pursuant
 to the Treaty
 on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)
. However, in the course of the 
global financial 
crisis, 
the 
ECB was characterised in the mass media as one of the key 
actors in charge of addressi
ng the economic crisis
.74 Indeed, during the crisis, citizens 
became more aware of the ECB
 and more inclined to state an opinion on whether they 
trusted it
 .75 At the same time, since it is an EU institution, citizens are likely to 
evaluate the ECB as part o
f the overall EU framework, together with other institutions, 
such as the European Commission or the European Parliament. Thus, when asked 
whether they trust the ECB, citizens may not only take into account inflation 
developments, but also other
 macroecono
mic developments
 and their overall 
perception of the EU.
 Taken together, citizens™ views on the euro on the one hand and the ECB on the 
other 
shed light on their attitudes towards EMU
. Citizens can hold consistently 
positive or negative views on both the e
uro and the ECB, but they can also diverge in 
their views on the single currency and the central bank. Figure 1 shows a 
cross
-tabulation of support for the euro and trust in the ECB, which results in four 
groups of supporters and sceptics of EMU:
 the first
 group
 neither supports the euro 
nor trusts the ECB (EMU
-sceptics); the second 
group
 supports the euro, but does not 
trust the ECB (ECB
-sceptics); the third 
group
 does not support the euro, but trusts the 
                                        
                           
 72  Indeed, in spring 2019 the euro was the second most
-mentioned, meaning re
spondents associated it 
with the EU, second only to freedom of movement. See European Commission,

 Typology of attitudes towards EMU
  Note: The fifth group, which includes respondents who answer
ed ﬁdon™t knowﬂ to one or both of the questions, is not included in the 
overview.
 Different 
combinations of attitudes towards EMU 
hold different implications for 
economic and monetary integration
. Among these four groups, the first group, 
referred to as ﬁEMU
-sceptics,ﬂ appears to be the most critical to understand in that 
these citizens, lacking su
pport for either the euro or the ECB, 
may be open to 
or 
actively support a reversal of
 economic and monetary integration, potentially 
undermining
 the smooth functioning of EMU. A significant
 prevalence of the second 
group, namely ﬁECB
-scepticsﬂ among euro 
area citizens 
may 
reduce acceptance of 
ECB actions; at the same time, the continued support in this group for the single 
currency indicates an outlook that is in principle pro
-European. The third group, 
ﬁeuro
-scepticsﬂ is puzzling in that these citizens tr
ust the ECB, but oppose a single 
currency; this may be explained by general scepticism towards policymaking at the EU 
level or attachment to national currencies that were superseded by the euro, coupled 
with high levels of trust in the functioning of insti
tutions. The fourth group, 
ﬁEMU
-supporters,ﬂ provide the strongest support for the project of economic and 
monetary integration in that they favour the single currency and express trust in the 
ECB.

  85 4 What we know about the different groups in the typology 
of 
attitudes to EMU
 4.1
 Measuring trust in the ECB and support for the euro
 The empirical analysis of the prevalence of 
the 
differe
nt 
groups
 of 
supporters 
of 
EMU
 draws
 on survey data from
 the 
Eurobarometer
. We use individual survey 
data from 40 waves of the bi
-annual Standard Eurobarometer from 1999
77 to 2019. 
The analysis is restricted to respondents from Member States
 in the euro area
. As a 
(repeated) cross
-sectional survey, 
the Eurobarometer
 does not allow for panel 
analys
is and cannot track intra
-indi
vidual changes in attitudes 
over time.
 Nevertheless, it gives an
 insight into attitudes towards the euro and the ECB
 among 
euro area citizens over time and
 under changing political and macroecon
omic 
conditions
. While the Eurobarometer has been criticised for a number of 
methodological reasons,
 it remains one of the most widely used cross
-national 
surveys
 and has become the main data source for comparative empirical research on 
public opinion in t
he EU
 and
 on the politics and sociology of European unification.
 Support for the euro and trust in the ECB are operationalised using standard 
measures in the literature.
 To assess respondents™ support for the single currency, 
we use the question 
ﬁWhat is y
our opinion on each of the following statements? 
Please tell me for each statement, whether you are for it or against it: A European 
economic and monetary union with one single currency, the euro.ﬂ To assess 
respondents™ support for the ECB, we use the que
stion ﬁPlease tell me if you tend to 
trust or tend not to trust these European institutions: The European Central Bank.ﬂ 
Respondents replying ﬁdon™t knowﬂ to one or both
 of the questions are placed in a fifth 
group called ﬁOther (don™t know)ﬂ, while those 
refusing to answer are omitted from the 
analysis.
78 Depending on the survey wave, between 20
-35% of respondents fall into 
this fifth category (see Chart 2) and, of these, roughly two
-thirds reply ﬁdon™t knowﬂ to 
the question regarding trust in the ECB.
 The
 design
 of the Eurobarometer questionnaire
 may affect response behaviour 
for the items regarding support for the euro and trust in the ECB.
 In particular, 
the indicator of trust in the ECB is part of a series of questions assessing respondents™ 
trust in dif
ferent EU institutions, notably the European Commission and the European 
Parliament. This design may invite satisficing behaviour, whereby respondents do not 
sufficiently differentiate between items within the series because they lack distinct 
views on the
 individual institutions and/or may try to be consistent in their response 
behaviour, supporting or rejecting all statements in the series.
79 Furthermore, the 
order of the questions in the questionnaire may affect response behaviour, as 
                                        
                           
 77  Or the respective year 
a country joined the euro area.
 78  The share of Eurobarometer respondents who refuse to answer either question is very small. There are 
no data on respondents refusing to answer the question on trust in the ECB, 
and less than 1% of 
respondents are reported to have refused to answer the question on support for the euro in the 
Eurobarometer waves since 2018. We exclude these respondents from our analysis.

  86 questions asked earl
ier in the survey may affect response behaviour on later 
questions.
 A comparison of findings from the Eurobarometer and other datasets 
lends 
external validity to the
 results
. While we cannot exclude that questionnaire effects 
have an impact on the findings
, a cross
-validation of levels of trust in the ECB and 
support for the euro as measured by the Eurobarometer with evidence on citizens™ 
attitudes towards the single currency and the ECB from other EU
-wide and national 
datasets shows that findings are broad
ly comparable across datasets. For example, 
the Autumn 2019 Standard Eurobarometer
80 (fieldwork conducted in November 2019) 
found that 76% of respondents in the euro area were in favour of the single currency. 
In a Flash Eurobarometer
81 from roughly the same
 period (fieldwork conducted in 
October 2019
), 65% of respondents indicated that the euro was a good thing for their 
country and 76% thought it was a good thing for the EU. Both Standard and Flash 
Eurobarometer surveys have observed an upward trend in supp
ort for the euro since 
2016. National surveys that occasionally field questions on trust in the ECB show 
similar levels of trust as those found based on Eurobarometer data.
82 The subsequent sections assess 
support for 
EMU by means of univariate 
analysis
. The changes in the make
-up of the different groups in the typology are 
illustrated along different sociodemographic indicators. Aggregated data for the euro 
area are weighted to account for differences in population size between euro area 
countries applyi
ng the standard 
post
-stratification weights
 provided for in the 
Eurobarometer survey data. This analysis can gauge simple correlations between the 
type of support for EMU and the individual sociodemographic indicators in question, 
and, through its time dim
ension, identify turning points and possible triggers of 
changes in support for EMU. However, the analysis neither controls for confounding 
variables, nor provides quantitative estimates of the strength of observed correlations, 
and it is also not able to 
establish causality.

  87 shows 
the share of respondent
s in each of 
the four groups from 1999
84 to 
2019 for the 
euro area aggregate
. Prior to the crisis, a relative majority of around 40
% of euro area 
citizens were EMU
-supporters (
dark 
blue line 
in Chart 2
). This group shr
ank
 from the 
onset of the financial and
 economic crisis in 2008
-09 and reache
d a trough in 2013
-14. It stabilise
d in subsequent years and in 2017
-18 recover
ed to levels just below those 
seen before the crisis. In the aftermath of the crisis, citizens appear
ed to have lost 
confidence in the ECB,
 but did not necessarily turn against the project of a single 
currency per se, as evidenced by the growing number of those still supporting the 
euro, but lacking trust in the ECB
. This
 group 
became the largest group in the years 
2013-16 (yellow
 line 
in Cha
rt 2
).There was also 
an increase in the number of 
EMU
-sceptics
 (red
 line 
in Chart 2
), which peaked in 2014, when 
close to 
25% of euro 
area citizens support
ed neither the euro nor the ECB
. By spring 2018 this group 
had 
contracted, representing
 less than
 15% of respondents. The fourth group, i.e. citizens 
who 
support the ECB but not the euro (
green
 line
 in Chart 2
), 
has decreased further 
from low levels to become
 negligibly small across the euro area 
in recent years
 (less 
than 5
% of respondents). 
Finally, the
 decreasing number of respondents who reply 
ﬁdon™t knowﬂ to one or both of the questions (light blue line in Chart 2) indicates that 
growing awareness of and familiarity with the single currency and the ECB 
Œ be it 
through day
-to-day experience with the eu
ro as a means of payment or increased 
media attention on the ECB in the crisis 
Œ has also led citizens to be more confident in 
expressing an opinion about the two.

 than 
support for the euro
. The relative decline in the size of the group of 
EMU
-supporters over the 
period 2008
-13 is mainly due to the concurrent decrease in 
trust in the ECB, as indicated by the growing number of ECB
-sceptics over the same 
period (see Chart 2). These findings suggest that support
 for the euro 
is 
more resistant 
to negative experiences 
such as the crisis, 
while the
 decline in trust in the
 ECB 
during
 the 
economic downturn
 indicates a more
 performance

orientation, in line with 
recent findings by other studies.

, the
 growing
 share of euro area 
citizens
 that 
neither t
rust the ECB nor support the euro
 (EMU
-sceptics)
 over the 
course of
 the crisis 
suggests that 
negative experiences 
during the crisis also 
negatively affected
 support for the EMU project more generally
, possibly via 
dissatisfaction 
with the outputs of Europe
an economic governance. 
However, t
his 
trend seem
ed to stop and eventually reverse as the economy recovered. 
Owing to 
data availability, these trends do not reflect the potential impact of the coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) pandemic that started in early 2020.
 The 
decline in trust in the ECB is part of a broader decline in trust in public 
institutions
 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis
. In effect, not only the 
ECB, but most 
national and supranational 
public institutions 
in Europe
 saw public trust 
decrease in the past decade, making the 
decline in
 trust in the ECB
 part of a wider 
trend. Currently the level of trust in the ECB seems to be at a neutral level, with roughly 
equal shares of respondents expressing trust or distrust in the
 ECB. Box 1
 summarises developments in public trust in EU and national institutions since the 
global financial crisis.

decline in trust in public institutions. Since the onset of the global financial crisis, 
there has been a 
decrease in trust in 
public insti
tutions in Europe at both national and supranational level. In fact, this 
trend can be observed across most advanced economies. The decline in trust in the ECB seen over 
the 
past decade is thus not specific to the ECB. At the same time, attitude surveys in
dicate that 
popular trust in the ECB has declined more than trust in national and even other EU institutions. This 
box explores the developments in trust in the ECB relative to other institutions, with a view to teasing 
out common and distinct features of 
the decrease
, as well as
 recent improveme
nts in popular trust in 
the ECB.
 Trust 
in EU and national institutions
 In the decade running up to the global financial crisis, net trust among euro area citizens in the 
European Commission, the European Parliament 
and the ECB stood at robustly positive and roughly 
comparable levels, with the European Parliament enjoying a small lead (
see Chart A
). Net trust in 
these EU institutions was significantly higher than net trust in national governments or national 
parliamen
ts by a margin of between 20 and 40 percentage points. 
Even
 before the crisis, net trust in 
national governments or parliaments 
already 
tended to be negative (i.e. 
with 
more survey

With the 
onset of the 
crisis, trust in national institutions fell further, but net trust in the abovementioned 
EU institutions and the EU as a whole 
also 
des
cended into negative territory.
 While the fall in trust was initially 
rather broad
-based across public institutions, the loss 
of trust has 
been more pronounced for EU institutions
, and the recovery in trust among them has been uneven. In 
fact, compared 
with
 both EU and national institutions, trust in the ECB appears to have 
been 
disproportionately affected by the crisis, experiencing a deeper fall and a slower recovery. The result 
is that
, currently
, net trust in the ECB still
 lies
 in slightly negative territory, standing at 
-2 percentage 
points in autumn 2019
, whereas net tr
ust in the European Commission and the European Parliament
 has been positive since 2017.

 Trust in the ECB compared 
with trust in
 national institutions
 Since 
reaching a
 trough in spring 2014, net trust in the ECB has recovered
 partially
, and the gap over 
national governments has widened again
 slightly. At the
 aggregate euro area level, net trust in the 
ECB in late 2019 was 23 p
ercentage 
points
 higher than
 net
 trust 
in the national governments. 
However, a closer look reveals that the widening gap is 
masking heterogeneous developments at the 
country level
. Overa
ll, albeit still slightly negative at the aggregate euro area level, at the end of 2019 
net trust in the ECB was above the level of
 net
 trust in national government in all euro ar
ea countries 
except Austria, Germany and Luxembourg (see Figure A).
 Broadly s
peaking, it appears that the trust gap has fallen 
more
 in those countries where the gap was 
highest prior to the crisis, and that trust in the ECB 
in comparison to trust in
 national government 
suffered particularly in the countries most affected by the cri
sis and in Germany and the Netherlands.

main 
exceptions among the countries hit

  91 crisis but has since largely bounced back, and those that have seen robust support for 
EMU throughout t
he crisis years (see Chart 3
). Countries severely affected by the economic crisis
 experienced a dip in support 
for EMU
. It is not surprising that the first pattern is found almost exclusively in 
countries that were severely affected by the economic crisis after 2008 and 2009, and 
is particularly strong in Ireland, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovenia. With 
the exce
ption of Slovenia, all of these countries entered financial assistance 
programmes during the crisis. In these countries, typically the share of ECB
-sceptics 
grew mainly during the crisis. The share of euro
-sceptics also experienced a 
temporary spike, but h
as since returned to near pre
-crisis levels.
 Countries less affected by the crisis ten
d to show relatively stable support
 for 
EMU
. By contrast, the second pattern of high and relatively stable support for EMU 
can be observed in countries that were less aff
ected by the crisis, such as Belgium, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Malta, Austria, Slovakia and Finland. In these 
countries, since the crisis the share of ECB
-sceptics has typically grown moderately 
and at a steady pace from a very low level, trending slig
htly above the share of 
euro
-sceptics. However, both scepticism towards the ECB and the euro remained 
minority attitudes throughout the crisis and afterwards.
 Germany, France and Italy display idiosyncratic patterns of support
 for EMU
. The three largest eu
ro area countries 
Œ Germany, France and Italy 
Œ are important 
exceptions to the two patterns described above. They follow a common pattern of their 
own that is characterised by support for EMU that is also fairly stable but moderate. 
During the crisis, whe
n there was a slight dip in support for EMU, ECB
-sceptics (in the 
case of France and Germany) and EMU
-sceptics (in the case of Italy) temporarily 
constituted the largest groups. The relative sizes of the groups have since reversed, 
but the share of ECB
-sce
ptics in these countries has lingered above pre
-crisis levels 
(and in France is on a par with the share of EMU
-supporters).

 also
 considerable differences in 
patterns
 of support
 for EMU
 within 
countries
. Applying the typology of attitudes towards EMU at the regional level to 
identify the predominant group by region
86 reveals that the geography of support for 
EMU varies significantly 
by country (see Figure 2).
87 By showing only the predominant 
group in each region, which in some regions has only a very narrow lead over other 
groups, the map tends to overstate differences between regions. Nevertheless, it 
serves to illustrate that in 
som
e countries
, one 
group in the typology
 dominat
es throughout
, while 
other
 countries 
show strong regional 
differences. Among the 
countries with strikingly homogenous regional attitudes are Ireland, the Netherlands, 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Fi
nland, where EMU
-supporters are the 
predominant group throughout the country. Slovenia is similarly homogeneous, but is 
predominantly ECB
-sceptic.
 Countries with heterogeneous patterns of support for EMU at the sub
-national 
level tend to see two predominan
t groups.
 In the cases of Belgium, Germany, 
                                        
                           
 86  The definition of regions follows the 
European Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), 
using level 1 for the larger euro area EU Member States (Germany, France and Italy) and NUTS2 for the 
other euro area countries.
 87  To ensure a sufficient number of observations by region, r
egional
-level observations for each group in the 
typology of attitudes towards EMU are aggregated 
between autumn 2016 and spring 2019
. This ensures 
at least 100 observations for most NUTS2 regions. However, in line with the developments in support for 
EMU 
since the crisis, which is marked by a growing share of EMU
-supporters, this probably overstates 
the number of regions that are dominated by either EMU
-sceptics or ECB
-sceptics.

  94 boomers born up to 1964, generation X born up to 1980 and millennials born after 
1980 Œ the relative sizes of the groups of different types of supporters of EMU have 
been consistently close to those within the entire population over the past tw
o decades.
 The war generation, i.e. the oldest cohort, has a 
higher share of respondents 
answering ﬁdon™t knowﬂ 
than the other three cohorts
. Prior to the crisis, this 
cohort also accounted for a marginally, but consistently, lower share of 
EMU
-supporters.
 Over the past few years, however, this cohort has counted slightly 
fewer EMU
-sceptics and ECB
-sceptics than younger cohorts. The high share of 
respondents answering ﬁdon™t knowﬂ seems to suggest that older people may find it 
more difficult than younger co
horts to form an opinion about recent steps in European 
integration, be it in the form of relatively new institutions such as the ECB or the single 
currency. A deeper analysis of the underlying data reveals that the war generation in 
particular tends to re
spond more frequently ﬁdon™t knowﬂ to the question on trust in the 
ECB, and that a similar pattern can also be found in their responses to questions 
regarding trust in other EU institutions. So rather than being specific to recent 
European integration or t
he ECB, it appears that older people™s attitudes towards EU 
institutions are less well defined than those of other cohorts.

 Whether respondents fall into the group of

-support
ers 
is associated with 
their
 level of education and occupational
 background, but differs little between 
genders
. Support for EMU tends to increase with the number of years spent in 
education (see Chart 5). While about 30% of people who ended full
-time education at 
age 15 or younger are EMU
-supporters, around 40% of people who finished their 
education between the ag
es of 16 and 19 fall into that category, as do around 50% of 
those who were aged 20 or older when they completed their education. People without 
any full
-time education display similar but more volatile attitudes than the first group. 
Across these educatio
nal groups, the share of ECB
-sceptics has trended upwards 
over time.
 This pattern is also reflected in support for EMU by occupation, with managers, 
students, other white

 the number of those distrusting the ECB and those

 attitu

  100 4.6
 European attitudes and political orientations
 Citizens™ attitudes towards the EU are highly correlated with their views on the 
euro and the ECB.
 The euro and 
the ECB are part of the EU™s institutional framework 
and policymaking at the European level, so one would expect that attitudes towards 
them are shaped by citizens™ overall attitudes towards the European project. This is 
indeed supported by the data. Takin
g citizens™ image of the EU as an indicator of their 
general attitude towards the EU and matching it against the typology of attitudes to 
EMU, one finds that the largest share of citizens with a negative image of the EU also 
tend to be EMU
-sceptics, while 
an overwhelming 
majority of those holding a positive
 image of the
 EU tend to be EMU
-supporters (not shown)
. Moreover, political interest 
seems moderately
 related to 
support for EMU
. EMU
-supporters are in the majority 
among respondents who show at least a s
light 
interest in political affairs, with the share of EMU
-supporters increasing somewhat in 
line with the degree of political interest (see Chart 8). By contrast, the share of 
EMU
-sceptics declines with increasing political interest. Notably, s
cepticism t
owards 
the ECB appears 
to be similarly strong
 across
 all 
respondents 
irrespective of their 
degree of political interest.

ﬂ 5 Conclusion
 Trust in the ECB and support for the euro have diverged in recent years.
 The
 share of the euro area population that supports the euro remained relatively steady 
throughout the economic and financial crisis starting in 2008
-09 and by late 2019 had 
trended upwards to reach an all
-time high. By contrast, the share of citizens trustin
g the ECB fell with the onset of the financial crisis and then recovered partially to a 
neutral level.
 This disconnect
 can be further examined
 through the lens of 
the
 typology of 
attitudes towards 
EMU
. Whereas EMU
-supporters are found to represent the larg
est 
share of the euro area population and remained so during the crisis, the share of 
ECB
-sceptics rose significantly during the crisis, while the share of EMU

 Citizens™
 attitudes towards the ECB, the euro and Economic and Monetary Union
  102 grew. By contrast, the percentage of euro
-sceptics has remained relatively low. Th
is 
illustrates rather powerfully that citizens distinguish between the euro and the ECB, 
and have different expectations of them. It also shows that the drivers of support for 
the ECB are distinct from the drivers of support for the euro. At the same time,
 the fall 
in trust in the ECB from very favourable pre
-crisis levels has to be seen as part of a 
wider development of declining trust in public institutions in Europe in the aftermath of 
the global financial crisis.
 A breakdown of 
support for 
EMU 
along
 soc
iodemographic 
lines
 sheds light
 on 
who tends to support EMU and who does not
. Exploring
 types of support for EMU 
along different sociodemographic lines 
Œ notably geography, age and education, as 
well as respondents™ perceptions of the economic and financia
l situation and broader 
attitudes towards the EU 
Œ reveals which parts of the euro area population are more or 
less likely to support EMU. While the univariate form of this analysis neither estimates 
the strength of correlations nor controls for confoundin
g factors, the patterns it reveals 
over time allow possible reasons for the disconnect between trust in the ECB and 
support for the euro
 to be deduced.
 The analysis suggests that popular support for EMU 
Œ in particular
, trust in the 
ECB 
Œ hinges to a large
 extent on citizens™ perceptions of their personal
 financial situation
 and the overall economic situation
. Perceptions of the state of 
the national and European economies and individuals™ financial situation are highly 
correlated with support for EMU and, 
in particular, trust in the ECB. This finding is 
further corroborated by the geographic distribution of support for EMU, which reveals 
a considerably higher share of EMU
-sceptics and ECB
-sceptics in euro area countries 
that were more affected by the crisis
. Similarly, support for EMU varies strongly with 
education and occupation, with more years in education and higher
-skilled 
occupations 
Œ important determinants of one™s personal material situation 
Œ being 
associated with greater support for EMU, despite a
 recent uptick in the share of 
ECB
-sceptics across different education levels.
 By contrast, other sociodemographic indicators seem to be less relevant
 for 
support for EMU
. There is no marked difference in patterns of support for EMU 
between genders or acro
ss age cohorts, with perhaps the minor exception of the war 
generation, which accounts for a smaller share of EMU
-supporters overall, but a 
higher share of ﬁdon™ knowﬂ answers. Among the sociodemographic indicators 
considered, political interest appears mo
st relevant, as support for the EMU appears 
to be somewhat greater among respondents who are more interested in politics.
 While the high and steady 
level of 
support for the euro is good news for the 
single currency, the sensitivity of 
support for the 
ECB h
olds important lessons 
on how citizens view and assess the performance of the central bank.
 The 
findings lend support to the hypotheses that support for the ECB is strongly related to 
perceptions of economic outcomes, but also to cognitive factors and mate
rial interests 
related to education or occupation. While the analysis shows that trust in the ECB is 
vulnerable to economic outcomes 
Œ potentially including those beyond the ECB™s 
control 
Œ it also suggests that trust in the ECB can be improved by the inst
itution 
providing information on its tasks and objectives, and by continuing to pursue its

 More inclusive communication 
and efforts to improve general understanding of
 the ECB™s mandate and tasks may help foster trust in the ECB.
 In particular, given 
the heterogeneity in support for the EMU and scepticism of the ECB observed 
between and within countries, as well as among different parts of the population, 
making communi
cation more accessible to people with differing levels of education 
and prior knowledge, and also addressing the concrete concerns of citizens in different 
parts of the euro area 
Œ such as the ECB™s role in economic outcomes 
Œ can enhance 
trust in the ECB.
 The heterogeneity within countries highlights the need to reach out 
beyond capital cities. In addition, action to increase knowledge not just on personal 
finances, but also on how financial markets and central banks function, 
including the 
services they p
rovide to citizens in their everyday lives, 
for example
 in the fields of 
payments or cash provision,
 may further improve citizens™ understanding of and trust 
in the ECB and its policies.
 Enhanced communication efforts to foster trust in the ECB will be in 
its
 interest.
 Higher levels of trust in the central bank not only help steer inflation expectations and 
promote trust in the currency, thus supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy, but 
also preserve the central bank™s independence by shielding it f
rom political pressures. 
In the context of EMU, having a more trusted and hence more effective central bank 
also encourages citizens to perceive European economic integration as successful 
and thus fosters greater popular support for significant economic a
nd financial, as well 
as political, steps towards greater integration. In turn, such steps could further 
enhance the effectiveness of the ECB™s policy and improve the overall welfare of euro 
area citizens.

89 1 Introduction
 The tightening of financial conditions as a result of the Global Financial Crisis 
(GFC) and the subse
quent sovereign debt crisis in the euro area led to severe 
difficulties for small and medium
-sized enterprises (SMEs) in accessing 
finance.
 The survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), which has been 
conducted on behalf of the ECB and the Eur
opean Commission since
 2009, 
reveals 
significant shifts in firms™ financing conditions since the start of the GFC.
90 During the 
financial crisis and the subsequent euro area 
sovereign debt crisis
, a substantial share 
of SMEs highlighted access to finance 
as one of the most pressing problems affecting 
their business activity
. Moreover, firms across different
 countries and 
sectors faced the 
same issue.
 Monetary policy measures, including non
-standard 
ones
, have contributed to 
improv
ing
 access to finance 
for
 euro area 
non
-financial corporations since the 
GFC
. This article reviews the available evidence on the impact of some of the 
non
-standard measures. These measures 
Œ particularly those related to 
bank 
financing, but also those related to some additional sourc
es of financing for SMEs 
Œ are key to understanding the evolution of SMEs™ financing conditions over the last ten 
years.
 While SMEs™ financing conditions have significantly improved over recent 
years, some important challenges remain
ed even before the coro
navirus 
(COVID
-19) pandemic that started late in 2019
. For example, SAFE results indicate
 that
 financing gaps
 Œ i.e. the difference between 
financial 
needs and 
the 
availability of 
external funding
 Œ remain
ed for specific financing instruments, notably the 
market
-based ones. 
Diversification across alternative financing 
instruments can 
make
 an important contribution to resilience against adverse financial and real shocks. 
Therefore, this article provides both a 
taxonomy 
of 
SMEs™ financing patterns 
based 
on 
a cluster analysis
 Œ before the onset of the pandemic crisis 
Œ and some evidence on 
the implications for firms™ investment decisions. For example, 
SMEs tend to be in the 
clusters where flexible short
-term debt or long
-term bank loans are the main financing 
instruments. 
Also, a 
combinatio
n of 
leasing/factoring and short
-term loans 
was of 
particular importance for SMEs
, compared with larger firms.

 90  As a reference, in the s
urvey conducted 
between 16 September and 25 October 2019, t
he sample size 
for the euro area 
was 11,204 firms, of which 10,241 (91
%) had fewer than 250 employees
. For more

e the financial crisis: evidence 
from survey data
  105 In the context of the coronavirus crisis, the emergence of new financing difficulties 
should stand out in relation 
to the current vintage of data and against the background 
of the pre
-existing financing options for SMEs across the euro area
. A companion 
box 
in this Economic Bulletin
 issue
 summarises the results of the last 
round
 of SAFE 
conducted during March and April
 2020, and elaborates on the specific challenges 
posed by the 
coronavirus crisis
 for SMEs.
 2 Access to finance
 and credit rationing over time
 Starting 
in 2009, there 
have been
 three important phases in firms™ perceptions
 of their financing conditions.
 These phases 
have 
coincided with periods over which 
the monetary transmission mechanism was impaired 
to various degrees, negatively 
affect
ing
 SMEs
™ financing conditions. 
Therefore
, ECB measures taken to restore the 
transmission mechanism also had a positive im
pact on SMEs
™ access to finance 
during those periods.
 The first phase covered the period from the launch of the survey 
in 2009, to September 2012, when the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) 
programme was announced. During this period,
 SMEs reported that
 access to finance 
ranked
 second, 
after finding customers
, among 
the biggest obstacle
s to conducting 
business
 (see Chart 1).
91 The second period, from the last quarter of 2012 to March 
2016, was characterised by several unconventional monetary policy (UMP) measures, 
including the introduction of negative rates in June 2014, the start of the Targeted 
Longer
-Term Refinancing Operat
ions (TLTRO I) in September 2014 and the ECB™s 
asset purchase programme (APP) in March 2015. According to the survey, difficulty 
accessing finance, while remaining an important concern for firms, started to gradually 
become less acute during this period, a
nd was outweighed by difficulties with finding 
skilled staff and experienced managers. The last period starts in spring 2016 and runs 
until September 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic. The same period witnessed 
the launching of the TLTRO II and TLTRO I
II, as well as the corporate sector purchase 
programme (CSPP). Since spring 2016, only about 8% of SMEs have reported access 
to external financing as their main concern, compared with nearly 20% in 2009.
 The financing situation of euro area firms was parti
cularly severe for SMEs, 
with some differences across sectors
. The percentage of firms that perceived 
access to finance as their main problem was consistently higher for SMEs than for 
large companies over the whole period concerned (see Chart 1). Regarding
 sectors, 
until September 2012 it was particularly the construction sector that found access to 
finance to be a major concern, with 22% of construction SMEs reporting this, 
compared with 15% of SMEs from the services sector (see Chart 2). This may reflect,
 for example, greater scrutiny by financial institutions when lending to the construction 
sector following the GFC. In the last phase, however, little variation was evident across 
sectors in this regard. At the same time, the availability of skilled staff 
became the most 
pressing issue affecting the construction sector (29%), often related to the introduction 
of new technologies combined with an ageing workforce. Construction was affected to 
                                        
                           
 91  SAFE contains a broad question to shed light on 
firms™
, and in particular SMEs
™, 
assessments of 
problems affecting their business operations. Those concerns can be 
either on the 
demand
 side, 
such as
 finding customers, competition, regulation and 
the 
availability of skilled labour, or o
n the supply side, 
such 
as access to finance and production or lab
our
 costs

 Firms that were actively seeking external financing became less financially

 On the basis of the SAFE results, firms are considered 
financially constrained if any of the three following condi
tions apply: (i) they applied for 
a bank loan and had their application rejected; (ii) they received a loan offer but either 
the cost was too high or the quantity offered was too low; or (iii) they 
did not apply for a
 loan because 
they
 feared a rejection

 Access

ence 
from survey data
  107 area SMEs
 that regarded 
bank loans 
as 
relevant 
to their funding 
were
 constrained in 
obtaining a bank loan
. In the second phase (until around March 2016), that percentage 
declined to approximately 12% and it has
 stabilised at around 8% in recent years (see 
Chart 3).
 The 
share
 of 
financially 
constrained firms 
varied
 by firm 
size, 
categor
y and 
country.
 SMEs tended to more frequently report that they were financially constrained
 than large companies, although the pe
rcentages have declined over time (see Chart 
3). Among SMEs, other characteristics that determine differences across firms are 
their ages and the degree of innovation. Small and young firms have particular 
difficulties in accessing external finance.
93 This 
might be related to the fact that they 
are more likely to face a higher degree of 
asymmetric 
information 
and contracting 
problems
.94 Mature SMEs (i.e. those in business for ten years or more) tended to be 
considerably less financially constrained than young
 ones (existing for less than 10 
years). SMEs involved in innovative activities experienced greater obstacles to 
obtaining a bank loan than firms that were providing mostly traditional products and 
services. In general, 
financing innovation is often diffic
ult for firms, given the
 additional 
uncertainty involved.
95 Chart 3 provides some evidence that innovative SMEs were 
more financially constrained.

constraint that is less 
serious
 compared 
with
 SMEs, but also the 
form of the constrain
t. Large 
companies more often reported being quantity constrained (i.e. banks offering a 
limited amount of the requested credit) than SMEs, while outright rejections were 
much smaller for large firms compared with SMEs (see Chart 4). Moreover, SMEs 
Œ particu
larly young and/or innovative firms 
Œ were more frequently discouraged from 
applying for loans. The percentage of discouraged firms remained relatively stable 
throughout the period considered, while the rejection rate clearly declined and 
reached lows of 2
% for SMEs and 1% for large companies in 2019. Bank credit costs 
appeared negligible in determining financial constraints for all companies, reflecting 
the significant extent of monetary policy accommodation since 2009.

 3 Effects of 
unconven
tional monetary policy
 In response to the weak economic conditions prevailing in the euro area, 
several monetary policy stimulus measures have been introduced over recent 
years
. These have i
nclud
ed a series of unconventional monetary policy measures, 
with 
the aim of restoring the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and bringing 
inflation back to the ECB™s price stability objective in a sustained way.
 These 
measures work
ed through several different channels, 
with
 some of 
the measures 
proving

 Access
 to finance for small and medium
-sized enterprises since the financial crisis: evidence 
from survey data
  109  The Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) 
program
me was launched in the 
summer of 2012
. Once a programme is established by the European Stability 
Mechanism (ESM), the OMT programme enables the purchase 
of eligible 
sovereign bonds issued by euro area governments
 in order to address severe 
distortions in sovereign bond markets. While no purchas
e has yet been 
conducted under t
he OMT programme
, its announcement
 help
ed to
 reduce the 
yields on sovereign bonds issued by fiscally
-stressed countries immediately, 
sharply, and permanently
.98 Furthermore, 
by alleviating pressure on euro area 
banks holding 
such bonds,
 the announcement of the OMT programme
 helped to 
sustain lending.
  Interest rates were 
lowered to negative territory 
in the summer of 2014
, thus 
providing
 additional monetary stimulus
.99 Also, 
the
 ECB has repeatedly 
communicated its 
intention to k
eep short
-term interest rates low for an extended 
period of 
time, with such forward guidance reinforcing the signalling channel of 
policy rate cuts.
  The 
CSPP
 was 
first announced as part of a broader set of measures under the 
expanded APP 
in 
March 
2016. It 
was launched in June 2016 
to allow for large 
direct purchases of eligible (
i.e. 
investment
 grade) bonds issue
d by companies 
based 
in the euro area.
100 The programme 
was 
aimed at reducing debt
-financing 
costs for large firms which could issue 
such bonds 
as 
an alternative financing 
source to bank loans, 
thereby freeing up more loan supply for 
smaller firms.
101  Several rounds of 
TLTROs
 were launche
d to further foster corporate lending. The 
amounts that credit
 institutions 
could
 borrow 
as part of 
these operations 
were
 linked to their eligible credit granted to 
euro area
-resident 
non
-financial
 corporations and households, excluding lending for house purchases, in all 
currencies. The first series of TLTROs (TLTRO I) was announced in June 2014 
and
 implemented in Septem
ber 2014. The
 second
 series (TLTRO II) was 
announced
 in March
 2016 and implemented in June 2016. Finally, a third series 
of TLTROs (TLTRO III) was announced in March 2019 and implemented starting 
from September 2019.
102                                                                                                                                          97  In this article, the focus is on analyses of UMP decisions based on the assessment of firms through SAFE 
replies. For this reason, not all the UMP measures implemente
d are considered here, for example, the 
programmes for the purchases of asset
-backed securities (ABS) or public assets (PSPP), although they 
had an impact on the financing conditions of euro area non
-financial corporations.

 Access
 to finance for small and medium
-sized enterprises since the financial crisis: evidence 
from survey data
  111 announcement 
of the OMT was specifically aimed at easing the financial market 
conditions 
in stressed countries and thereby indirectly improving access to finance in 
those countries.
 The 
announcement of the 
OMT 
programme
 led to an
 improvemen
t in credit 
access. Just before the OMT programme announcement, 18% of euro area SMEs 
and 10% of large enterprises were reporting
 a deterioration in the availability of bank 
loans in net terms (see Charts 6 and 7).
103 The programme represented a turning 
poin
t in firms™ perceptions, a conclusion that is confirmed by econometric analysis. 
Ferrando et al. 
showed 
that
 SMEs from 
vulnerable
 countries report
ed being less likely 
to be rationed or discouraged from applying for loans in the 
six
 months after the 
program
me announcement
.104 Despite the positive impact of the OMT and other UMP
 measures
, developments 
in credit 
supply 
to non
-financial corporations have diverged across the euro 
area since the European sovereign debt crisis
 (see Chart 7).
 Corbisiero and 
Faccia fo
und that the
 rejections of 
non
-financial corporations™ 
loan applications 
tended 
to be 
more frequent
 in countries more affected by the European sovereign debt 
crisis.
105 These rejections were
 influenced by
 the health of bank balance sheets, in 
particular by t
he presence of non
-performing loans (NPLs).
 This 
suggest
s that supply 
factors did play a
n important
 role in subdued credit in
 these
 countries. 
At relatively 
high levels of NPLs, banks tend 
to len
d less, even to creditworthy firms
.106 Such high 
levels 
of NPLs
 were
 mainly observed in 
vulnerable
 countries 
during the European 
sovereign debt crisis
, implying that 
the balance sheet weakness of individual banks 
in 
vulnerable countries may have 
contribute
d to the 
weak 
credit dynamics
 observed.
 Taken together, the 
above-mentioned 
empirical evidence lends support to the success 
of 
the 
ECB™s UMP measures 
in improving
 the 
terms and conditions of bank credit to 
SMEs,
 consistent with the 
ﬁbank lending viewﬂ of monetary
 policy transmission.

 Several studies show that the TLTROs led to s

various aspects of financing conditions for f
irms,
 for example by improving 
actual and expected

countries more affected by the European sovereign debt crisis

strongly so, for those from the rest of the

the improvements 
varied 
across different types of firms, 
with 
medium/large firms
 and
 mature firms
 benefiting most, as there is evidence that the 
impact of credit constraints on firm

 also important for 
SMEs.
 While bank loans have been the main source of finance

 the SAFE replies, the increased availability of bank loans to SMEs 
during this period 
was accompanied by improvements in the issuance of debt securities by large 
enterprises (see Charts 5 and 6).
 In addition to the transmission channels already discussed, UMP measures can 
have an impact on
 SMEs
™ access to finance through 
their expectations of the 
future availability of finance
. Ferrando et al.
 provide evidence for a 
ﬁfunding 
expectations channel
ﬂ of monetary policy by looking at how SMEs
™ decisions are 
affected by their expectations of future credit access
.112 This ﬁfunding 
expectations 
channel
ﬂ complemented the standard 
ﬁbank lending channel
ﬂ, under which monetary 
policy is transmitted to the real economy through changes in the level and composition 
of bank credit. The
 authors
 provide supporting evidence that three 
of the 
unconventional policies mentioned above, namely the 
announcements of the 
OMT
, the 
negative rates and 
the 
CSPP, had a significant effect on expectations of future 
credit availability
 (see Chart 8)
. In particular,
 immediately after the policy 
announcement
s, ex
pectations of future credit access improved relatively more for 
SMEs borrowing from banks that were expected to increase SME lending due to the 
policy measure
.113 The authors
 also find evidence that SMEs
™ investment and 
employment increased more at those fir
ms expecting bank c
redit to improve in the 
future.

look at the formation of expectations 
relating to
 the availability of bank finance among euro area 
SMEs. Firms seem to use a wider range of information at their disposal, 
e.g. 
on their sales and profits and 
the general economic environment. 
Importantly, SMEs seem to combine both backward and 
forward
-looking elements, in some cases including important policy announcements
, such as the OMT
. 113  This may well be the result of several additional factors set in motion by the announcement of the 
mea
sures. For example, in the case of negative interest rate policy, Altavilla et al. highlight another 
channel of pass
-through of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, through which 
sound banks 
can pass negative rates on to their corporate depositors w
ithout experiencing a contraction in funding.
 Furthermore, they show that t
he negative interest rate policy provides further stimulus to the economy 
through firms™ asset rebalancing.

 Overall, existing empirical evidence provides strong support for the positive 
impact of the 
UMP
 measures launched by the ECB over recent years to support 
the financing conditions of
 euro area firms, including
 SMEs.
 Importantly, the 
reported evidenc
e suggests that the non
-standard measures worked through different 
channels and that their impact varied somewhat across countries. In interpreting the 
results, it has to be kept in mind that isolating the effects of monetary policy is always 
challenging. 
Furthermore, in the case of the research reviewed in this section, the 
non
-standard nature of the measures 
Œ for which a very limited number of episodes 
exists 
Œ further complicates the identification process.
 4 Financing p
atterns and financial behaviour
 Despite the improvement in financing conditions and the policy measures 
implemented so
 far, 
some structural challenges for SMEs™
 access to finance
 remain
. These challenges
 are
 mainly 
related to 
the fact that euro area firms still use a 
limited number of th
e available financing instruments. To analyse this structural 
feature, this section focuses on the period
 from April to September 2019
. It represents 
a snapshot of the financing options chosen by euro area firms after the developments 
described in the prev
ious section.
 The financing options of euro area enterprises 
are limited to a
 few instruments, 
mostly related to the banking sector.
 Leasing and factoring 
for large companies 
and trade credit for SMEs 
are 
also 
important (see Chart 9). 
There are differences
 across firm sizes, though the relative importance of the funding sources remains the 
same
 overall
. In particular, SMEs tend to make less use of external funds
: at least 
one
-third of them report that they have not used external sources of finance. For larg

sources of SMEs in contrast to large enterprises. Many SMEs used only one type of 
finance (36%), where

(22%). 
When looking at firms using 
four

large enterprises is almost twice as high as for SMEs.

 (SAFE)
. Note: The figure shows the frequency of the number of different sources of finance the firms used to finance their
 operations.
 Firms of different sizes use different combinations of financial instruments
. In 
order to establish a taxonomy of financing patterns, firms in the SAFE sample are 
grouped on the basis of their
 sources of finance 
using a ﬁcluster analysisﬂ. 
Box
 1 reports 
on the results of such an analysis, based on 
the survey
 round
 for the period
 April
-September 2019.
 The 
taxonomy provides a snapshot of the financing behaviour 
of euro area firms
 until the period just before the coronavirus crisis. While the 
approach is by its nature related to a specific period, t
he analysis of survey replies
 in 
alternative periods, for instance
 April
-September 2012
, shows that firms displayed 
broadly similar financing patterns
.115 In the 
survey
 round for the period 
April
-September
 2019, each 
of the eight 
clusters contains around 7% to 10% of the 
total number of firms
, except for the largest cluster, which contains 
firms that have not 
reported the use of external sources of finance
 (38%).
 The taxonomy presented in 
Table 1 confirms t
hat large companies
, as 
defined 
by the
 number of employees or 
turnover
, are
 using more diverse sources of finance
 than SMEs
, and 
are also more 
likely
 to be
 listed on the stock mark
et or be part of a business group
. A higher 
percentage of large firms belong
s to the clusters with more financial instruments 
(mixed
 Œ market, 
mixed
 Œ family or friends
 and mixed
 Œ grants
, see Box
 1), particularly
 when considering the difference between firms with very high 
turnover 
(more than 
•50 million) and low turnover (less t
han 
•10 million). By contrast, SMEs tend to more often
 be in the clusters where flexible short
-term debt or long
-term bank loans are the main 
financing instruments. 
A combinatio
n of 
leas
ing/factoring and short
-term loans 
was also of particular importance f
or SMEs (

 115  As a signal that the taxonomy has changed slightly over time along 
with firms™ financing conditions, the 
empirical analysis referring to 2012 points to seven instead of eight clusters, as it is not possible to group 
firms around the cluster with the extensive use of grants or subsidised loans.

2  A taxonomy of financing patterns in the euro area: a cluster analysis approach
 Prepared by A. Ferrando and K. Ba
kowska
 The empirical analysis used to identify financing patterns 
for
 euro area enterprises is based on a 
cluster analysis approach similar to the research 
carried out by
 Moritz et al. and Masiak et al.
116 The 
cluster analysis groups firms according to their use of the nine financing instruments described in 
Chart 9 in such a
 way that the groups are both homogenous (small within
-cluster variance) and very 
distinct from each other (large between
-cluster variance). The empirical analysis is based on the 
round
 that covers the April to September 2019 
period 
for a total of 10
,732 firms that reported whether 
they have used internal or external finance for their business activity in the previous six months. Being
 solely
 based on one 
round
, the taxonomy provides a snapshot of the financing behaviour of euro area 
firms
.117 Table A present
s the eight clusters obtained following the above
-mentioned procedure. The different 
clusters are presented by starting with those 
that include
 several financing instruments
, and moving 
towards clusters that use fewer financing options. Each cluster contai
ns around 7% to 10% of the total 
number of firms, except the last cluster
, which
 includes a large share of firms that have not reported 
the use of external sources of finance (38%).
 Cluster 1 (
mixed 
Œ market
): Firms in this cluster use a broad range of ins
truments which combines the 
highest use of retained earnings and sales of assets (81%) with a high usage of short
-term
 and 
long
-term bank loans (58% and 34%
 respectively
). 
In contrast to
 other clusters, firms in this group are 
the only ones to access marke
t-based finance (26%). Leasing and factoring 
are
 also relatively 
important instrument
s (50%), followed by trade credit (40%).
 Cluster 2 (
mixed 
Œ family or friends
): The main characteristic of this cluster is that all firms rely on 
funds from related compan
ies or family and friends. In addition, firms in this group 
mostly 
use 
short
-term bank loans (50%), together wi
th leasing and factoring (39%).
 Cluster 3 (
mixed
 Œ grants
): In this cluster
, all firms use subsidi
sed loans for their business activity
, which th
ey combine with banking products (58% short
-term bank loans and 48% long
-term bank 
loans) a
nd leasing and factoring (41%).
 Cluster 4 (
mainly 
trade credit
): These firms use only trade credit for their business activity, which they 
combine with short
-term 
bank financing (54%) and, to a lesser extent, with long
-term bank loans 
(26%). Leasing and factoring are also relatively important (38%).
 Cluster 5 (
mainly 
bank 
loans): 
This cluster is characteri
sed by firms that use
 long
-term loans together 
with short
-ter
m ones (55%). The other financing instrument used by firms in this cluster is leasing and 
factoring (37%).

 Cluster 6 (
mainly 
leasing and 
factoring
): For firms in this cluster
, leasing and factoring are the most 
important source of finance together with sho
rt-term loans (39%).
 Cluster 7 (
short
-term loans only
): Firms in this group only focus on short
-term financing
, and 
represent 8.7% of the total sample.
 Cluster 8 (
no external financing
): The last cluster is the largest one, covering 38% of the total sample
 of firms. It comprises firms that have not used external funds for their business and only 
9% of them 
reported hav
ing
 used internal funds in the previous six months.

118 Such financially
 fragile firms tend

(mixed

) or through trade credit 
(mixed

. Beyond 
these
 financing sources, vulnerable firms 
were mo
re likely to receive funds 
through
 grants or subsidi
sed bank loans. By contrast, 
a high share of profitable firms 
was in the cluster ﬁ
no external financing
ﬂ, probably because they have high retained 
earnings. They we
re more often using a variety of 
financial instruments, including 
market
-based ones
 (mixed 
Œ grants cluster
). This is also the case for innovative firms
 and exporters
. Bank loans 
Œ either short or long
-term
 Œ remain
ed an important source 
of finance for these three groups of firms.
 Firms d
iversif
ied
 their sources of finance according to the sector they belong 
to.
 Industrial f
irms 
were slightly more often in the cluster with more diversified 
financing options (
mixed
 Œ market cluster
). 
Industrial
 firms are on average larger and 
are more likel
y to be 
exporters
. Overall, 
they 
are able to attract debt and long
-term 
financing
, given their ability to provide collateral to secure their debt. By contrast, firms 
in the construction sector rely more on asset
-backed financing and short
-term bank 
loans
, as is the case in the cluster 
mainly
 leasing/factoring
. Firms in the trade sector 
require
d more short
-term debt and trade credit in their operations. The cluster analysis 
indicates that a relatively high percentage of them are grouped together in the clust
er 
with more financing options. Finally, firms 
in the services sector 
are less likely to use 
external financing instruments compared 
with
 firms in the other industries
, with many
 being 
in the cluster related to asset
-backed financing
 (mixed 
Œ leasing/facto
ring
). Firms that are expecting to grow in the ne
ar future rely on several financing 
options.
 Firms that were expecting to grow in 2020 
had
 higher
 financing
 needs. As 
the taxonomy shows, they ma
de use of several financing instruments
, being mostly 
grouped in the first three clusters
 of Table 1
. Financing gaps are more acute for firms using informal sources of finance.
 An 
important indicator derived from the SAFE dataset is the degree of financing gap
, defined as the differen
ce between 
the change in demand and in the availability of 
external financing. In the euro area
, the financing gap has remained negative since 
2014 for large companies and since 2015 for SMEs, meaning that the increase in 
needs for external financing was smaller than
 the improvement in access to external 
funds. In 2019, the weighted net percentages were quite similar between large firms 
and SMEs (
-3% and 
-4% respectively). Chart 11 plots the financing gap across the 
different clusters
. The financing gap 
is larger for 
the group of firms using mostly loans 
granted by family or friend
s, or by related businesses (
mixed
 Œ family or friends
). 
On average, 
these are 
companies that are financially vulnerable, with little capacity to 
generate internal funds. 
Many 
of them 
are fin
ancial
ly constrained.

SAFE report
. 5 Real effects of financing patterns
 The 
diversification of external sources of finance can be linked to the decisions 
of companies to invest, to hire or to build up inventories
. In the 
SAFE 
survey
, firms are asked 
about the use
 of both
 external 
and
 internal financing. 
The options in 
the question
naire 
comprise decisions about: 
(1) investment in fixed assets (property, 
plant or equipment); 
(2) inventory and other working capital; 
(3) h
iring and training of 
employees
; (4) d
eveloping and launching 
of 
new products or services
; (5) r
efinancing 
or payin
g off obligations
 and (6) expenditure for other purposes. Firms mainly use their 
external financing for fixed investment and working capital financing.
 Some stylised facts can be derived by plotting the percentages of firms that have used 
finance for the n
amed purposes in each of the eight clusters (see Chart 12).
119 First, f
irms investing in fixed assets use several financing instruments, mostly 
consisting in
 banking products
. More than 60
% of firms 
in the clusters with more 
financing options (
mixed 
Œ grants
, mixed
 Œ market and 
mainly bank loans
) use finance 
for fixed investment
. While 
firms used mostly long
-term bank loans
 in the 
mainly bank 
loans
 cluster
, they tend
ed to substitute them with subsidised loans and other sou
rces 
in the other two clusters.
 Secon
d, firms are mainly using trade credit and short
-term loans to finance 
their working capital,
 as shown in the second panel of Figure 12.
 Third, firms engaging in hiring 
and training 
activities use mostly 
leasing/factoring or internal sources 
of funds 
only.
 According to the taxonomy, 
                                        
                           
 119  The regularities 
could be
 subject to simultaneity concerns. For example, high
-growth firms are more 
reliant on multiple sources, but firms w
ith more diversified funding can 
also 
be more innovative and 
high
-growth
 as a result.
 Hence, there is no intention to provide any causal link
 in the stylised facts.

 Fourth, firms developing and launching new products or services tend to use a

-based products but also use other 
financing instruments.
 Finally, firms reporting hav

slightly more 
on funds from family or

 To further investigate the link between

 in the real economy
, a logistic regression model 
is run.

since the financial crisis: evidence

  123 Table 
2 reports the effects of the diversification of 
external funds by cluster
s on 
the purposes for which 
firms
 used financing
.121 Focusing on the highest marginal 
effects, the results show that firms using
 more
 grants or long
-term bank loans 
(i.e. 
grouped in the 
mixed
 Œ grants 
cluster)
 are 27% more likely to 
have invested in fixed 
asset activities than those not using external finance, all the other characteristics 
being equal.
 Also
, the probability of a firm investing 
in working capital is 26% higher for 
firms in the 
trade credit financing
 cluster. By contras
t, the third column in Table 
2 appears
 to indicate that 
external finance is not better than internal financing for 
firms 
hiring and training their employees. In fact, the marginal effect is even negative in 
some clusters. This is in line with previous find
ings demonstrating that bank 
finance 
displays a 
negative relation
ship
 to 
investment in 
intangible asset
s such as R&D, 
software, databases and IT networks, and training
.122 Furthermore, the probability of 
developing new products or services is
 not related to 
the use of bank products, but it is 
higher 
for firms using grants or market
-based finance
 in particular. In these cases, 
however, 
the marginal effect
s are 
relatively modest at around 7%
. Finally, i
n the last 
two columns
, the regression results confirm the stylised fact on the relative importance 
of informal finance for refinancing
 and 
other purposes.

 Since the 
Global 
Financial 
Crisis, a series of unconventional monetary policy 
measures have contributed to 
easing SMEs
™ access to finance
. This article has 
described the evolution of firms™ assessments of their financing conditions throughout 
the period
 until the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis
. In particular, firms
 in all 
euro 
area countries reported an 
overall decrease
 over time
 in their perceptions of being 
financially constrained
. Although
 it has gradual
ly improve
d since 
the 
mid
-2010s, challenges 
for
 SMEs™ 
access to finance remain, for example in terms of funding diversification
. Taking 
stock of the ov
erall development of firms™ financing conditions from 2009
 onwards, 
this article analyse
d the funding options firms had at 
their 
disposal
 in mid
-2019 through a 
cluster analysis approach. The resulting taxonomy highlights that the percentage of 
firms using 
market
-based financial instruments to fund their business remain
ed small
. This is d
espite 
both
 the difficulties encountered with their traditional funding source 
(i.e. bank lending) during the crisis and the many subsequent efforts 
since 2015 
to set

 Access
 to finance for small and medium
-sized enterprises since the financial crisis: 
evidence 
from survey data
  125 up a c
apital markets union (CMU) to facilitate SMEs
™ fundraising.
 From the taxonomy, 
it emerges that firms that 
were
 exporters, more profitable, more innovative and that 
were planning to grow more in the future tend
ed to diversify their financing instruments
 to 
a higher degree
. However,
 these firms 
also 
tend
ed to report higher financing gaps, 
namely
 the overall availability of external sources of finance 
being
 lower than their 
demand for them.
 The analysis highlights some important effects of monetary policy deci
sions on 
SMEs
™ access to finance over recent years.
  First, monetary policy measures predominantly aimed at supporting bank credit 
are crucial for SMEs in the light of their dependence on bank credit as the main 
source of external finance.
  Second, support f
or bank finance is particularly relevant for the funding of fixed 
investment by SMEs, which may play an important role in the transmission of 
monetary policy.
  Third, from a structural point of view, initiatives taken at the EU or national levels 
to support
 access to market
-based instruments are of the utmost importance. A 
diversification in sources of finance would facilitate the activity and the expansion 
of innovative firms in particular, while also generally making SMEs more resilient 
in situations where
 the supply of credit tends to dry up
. The outbreak of the pandemic has given rise to new, more severe and 
immediate challenges for SMEs in terms of their access to financing. See Box
 3 in this issue for additional information.
