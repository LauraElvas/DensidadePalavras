 Summary
  2 Update on economic and monetary 
developments
 Summary
 Incoming information since the last Governing Council meeting in early 
December
 is in 
line with 
the Governing Council™s
 baseline scenario of ongoing, but moderate, growth 
of the euro area economy. In particular, the weakness in the man
ufacturing sector 
remains a drag on euro area growth momentum.
 At the same time, 
ongoing, albeit 
decelerating, employment growth and increasing wages continue to support the 
resilience of the euro area economy. 
The risks surrounding the euro area growth 
outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in 
emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but have become less pronounced 
as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding.
 While inflation 
developments remain subdued overall, there are some signs of a moderate increase 
in underlying inflation in line with expectations.
 Against this background, the 
Governing Council kept 
its monetary policy stance unchanged
 at its meeting on 23 
January 2020. 
The
 unfolding monetary policy measures are 
underpinning favourable 
financing conditions for all sectors of the economy. In particular, easier borrowing 
conditions for firms and households are supporting consumer spending and business 
investment. This will sus
tain the euro area expansion, the build
-up of domestic price 
pressures and, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to 
the Governing Council™s
 medium
-term aim.
 Global economic activity remains moderate, but there are signs of stabilisation. In 
particular, the global manufacturing sector firmed in the last quarter of 2019, while the 
service
s sector remained broadly stable. 
Global trade remains weak
 amid signs of 
stabilisation
. A preliminary trade deal between China and the U
nited 
States
 has led t
o an easing of trade tensions
, which should contribute to 
remov
ing
 impediments to trade 
growth. Looking ahead, global inflationary pressures are expected to remain 
contained, while the balance of risks to global economic activity, although less 
pronounced,
 remains ti
lted to the downside
. Since the Governing Council meeting in December 2019, movements in euro area 
financial markets have been limited, with asset prices continuing to be supported by 
accommodative monetary policy and 
improved 
risk sentiment as 
trade tensions have 
further receded. Long
-term risk
-free rates 
are broadly unchanged 
and the EONIA 
forward curve has shifted slightly upwards, continuing to signal market expectations of 
an unchanged deposit facil
ity rate in the coming months. 
Sovereign sp
reads have 
remained broadly stable over this period. Equity prices have increased amid lower risk 
premia, and corporate bond spreads have decreased slightly. In foreign exchange 
markets, the euro has weakened slightly in trade
-weighted terms.
 Euro area rea
l GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, 
following growth of 0.2% in the second quarter. This pattern of moderate growth 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 1 / 2020
 Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 Summa
ry  3 reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of continued 
global uncertaint
ies, which has particularly affected the euro area manufacturing 
sector and has also dampened investment growth. At the same time, the services and 
construction sectors remain more resilient, despite some moderation in the latter half 
of 2019. Incoming eco
nomic data and survey information point to some stabilisation in 
euro area growth dynamics, with near
-term growth expected to be similar to rates 
observed in previous quarters. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue 
to be supported by favoura
ble financing conditions, further employment gains in 
conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the 
ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ growth in global activity.
 Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in 
December 2019, from 1.0% in 
November, reflecting mainly higher energy price inflation. On the basis of current 
futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to hover around current levels in the 
coming months. While indicators of inflation expectati
ons remain at low levels, 
recently they have either stabilised or ticked up slightly. Measures of underlying 
inflation have remained generally muted, although there are further indications of a 
moderate increase in line with previous expectations. While la
bour cost pressures 
have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is 
delaying their pass
-through to inflation. Over the medium term, inflation is expected to 
increase, supported by 
the ECB™s 
monetary policy measures, the ongoing
 economic 
expansion and solid wage growth.
 Regarding monetary developments, 
broad money (M3) growth 
stood at
 5.6% in 
November 
2019, 
broadly unchanged since August
. M3 growth continues to be backed 
up by bank credit creation and the narrow monetary aggregat
e M1 remained the main 
contributor to broad money growth. 
The growth of loans to firms and households 
remained solid, benefiting from the ongoing support provided by 
the ECB™s
 accommodative monetary policy stance, which is reflected in very low bank lendin
g rates. While the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged from 
October, at 3.5% in November, the annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial 
corporations moderated to 3.4%, from 3.8% in October, likely reflecting some lagged 
reaction
 to the past weakening in the economy.
 However, credit standards for both 
loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly 
unchanged, pointing to still favourable credit supply conditions. 
The Governing 
Council™s 
accommodative mon
etary policy stance will help to safeguard favourable 
bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing
 across all 
economic sectors and
 in particular for small and medium
-sized enterprises.
 Combining
 the outcome of the economic analy
sis with the signals coming from the 
monetary analysis
, the Governing Council
 confirmed that an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued 
robust 
convergence of 
inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the 
medium term.
 On the basis of this assessment
, the Governing Council
 decided to keep the
 key ECB 
interest rates
 unchanged and
 expect
s them to remain at their present or lower levels 
until 
it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, 
but below, 2% within 
its
 projection horizon, and such convergence has been 
consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 1 / 2020
 Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 Summary
  4 The Governing Council confirmed that it will
 continue to make net purchases under 
the 
ECB™s
 asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of •20 billion
. It expects 
them to run
 for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of
 the
 ECB
 policy rates
, and to end shortly before 
the Go
verning Council
 start
s raising the 
key ECB interest rates.
 The Governing Council
 also intend
s to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal 
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period 
of time past the date when 
it sta
rts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case 
for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample 
degree of monetary accommodation.
 In the light of the continued 
subdued inflation outlook
, the Governing Council 
reite
rated the need for a
 highly accommodative
 stance of monetary policy
 for a 
prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline 
inflation developments over the medium term. 
The Governing Council™s
 forward 
guidance will ensure that
 financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the 
inflation outlook
. 
In any case, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust 
all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a 
sustained ma
nner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.
 The Governing Council also decided to launch a review of the ECB™s monetary policy 
strategy
. The r
eview will encompass 
the 
quantitative formulation of price stability, 
the 
monetary policy toolkit, 
the 
economic
 and monetary analyses and communication 
practices
. 
Other considerations, such as financial stability, employment and 
environmental sustainability, will also be part of 
the 
review
, which is e
xpected to be 
concluded by 
the 
end of 2020
. The r
eview will be ba
sed on thorough analysis and 
open minds
. 
Accordingly, the Eurosystem will engage with all stakeholders.

 The outlook for global economic activity (excluding the euro area) remains 
subdued but has been showing signs of stabilisation
. The global 
composite 
output Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) excluding the euro area increased 
moderately in December. The manufacturing component in particular recovered in the 
fourth quarter, signalling a firming of global manufacturing activity, which 
had gradually 
weakened since early 2018.
 The services sector 
remained resilient and grew further in 
December (see Chart 1)

 Notes: The latest observations are for 
December 
2019. Risks 
to the global outlook remain elevated but are less skewed to the 
downside.
 The
 partial US
-China trade agreement represents a welcome easing of 
trade tensions. The so
-called ﬁPhase 1ﬂ deal includes
 a commitment from China to 
purchase a substantial amount of a broad range of US agricultural and other goods 
and services, which may affect demand for EU exports to China. It also aims to bring 
about changes in areas ranging from exchange rate policy to i
ntellectual property 
protection and technology transfer. The US Trade Representative has clarified that 
certain existing tariffs will be reduced 
Œ including the September 2019 tariffs, which will 
be halved 
Œ and that the planned December 2019 tariffs
 will 
be postponed indefinitely. 
Moreover, China has dropped duties that were to come into effect alongside the US 
tariffs previously scheduled for December and will continue to hold back from 
introducing retaliatory tariffs on US
-made automobiles and auto parts
. Financial conditions continued to loosen on the back of easing trade tensions.
 Financial conditions remain very loose by historical standards. In advanced 
economies this dynamic is partly related to the exceptional response by central banks 
to the Great 
Recession of 2007
-09 and the relatively weak global economic 
performance in recent years. In emerging markets, financial conditions also remain 
accommodative but have not eased to the same extent on account of the current 
broad
-based strength of the US dol
lar. Looking ahead, in 2020 financial conditions will

  6 benefit from anchored inflation rate expectations, firms™ expectations of earnings 
growth in the United States and other major economies, and a possible further easing 
of trade tensions.
 The global trad
e momentum remains weak, albeit amid signs of stabilisation
. Global merchandise imports continued to increase moderately in October, while the 
global PMI for new export orders
 excluding the euro area continued to recover in 
December. For the fourth quarter
 as a whole, the global PMI for new export orders 
increased significantly relative to the third quarter, with the index nearing the neutral 
threshold (see Chart 2). The recent easing of trade tensions further serves to remove 
impediments to global trade ac
tivity. In line with this outlook, high frequency trade data 
are, on balance, consistent with low but positive growth in world trade.

 Global 
inflation rose 
further 
in 
November
. Annual consumer price inflation in the 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD) 
increased to 1.8
% in 
November
, 
driven in part by high food price inflation in selected 
emerging
 market economies, including China and India. Meanwhile, i
nflation 
excluding 
energy and 
food 
increased only marginally to 2.1
% in November, from 2.0% 
in the previous month
. Looking ahead, global inflationary pressures are expected to 
remain contained. 
Wage
 growth in advanced economies continues to be moderate 
despite a tightening of labour markets and rising capacity constraints
. Oil markets have 
remained broadly stable
. Oil prices were supported only 
temporarily by the OPEC+ 
group of major oil producers
, w
ho extended their 
production cuts in early December. Prices spiked at around USD 70 per barrel in early 
January, following a rise in tensions in the Middle East, but fell back quickly after 
tensions eased. With high levels of inventories and US shale oil p
roduction, together 
with the International Energy Agency projecting global oil demand to slow in the first 
quarter of 2020, oil markets are expected to remain well supplied despite the recent

  7 OPEC+ agreement. Total non
-oil prices increased slightly (+1.7%)
 as both metal 
prices (+1.2%) and food prices rose (+2.8%).
 Economic growth in the United States remained moderate in the third quarter of 
2019. Annualised US real GDP growth stood at 2.1%. Despite the modest pick
-up in 
activity from second quarter growth 
of 2.0%, economic activity moderated as a result 
of weak investment, the fading effect of the 2018 tax reform and the maturing business 
cycle. Risks to the outlook have eased somewhat but are still tilted to the downside. 
While trade tensions with China ha
ve eased, the recent announcement by Boeing to 
halt, indefinitely, the production of its 737 MAX in January represents a new risk. The 
net impact on the economy so far has been modest, as a decline in deliveries has 
been offset by accumulating inventories.
 Looking ahead, however, weakness in the 
manufacturing sector is likely to persist. Apart from the issues at Boeing, prolonged 
trade uncertainties, subdued global growth and the broad
-based appreciation of the 
US dollar in recent years continue to weigh on
 the economy.
 In Japan, the government has prepared a stimulus package to support economic 
growth.
 In early December, the government of Prime Minister Abe announced a fiscal 
package to tackle downside risks to activity stemming from a weak external environ
ment 
and recent natural disasters. Under the package, fiscal spending amounts to 2.4% of 
GDP, which puts it among the largest fiscal stimulus packages enacted under 
ﬁAbenomicsﬂ. The package will largely be implemented in 2020
-21. It should be noted 
that the impact of the package on the economy partially offsets the recent increase in 
VAT. In addition, weak manufacturing pushed growth into negative territory in the last 
quarter of 2019. The economy is expected to return to moderate positive growth in early 
2020 as the impact of transitory factors dissipates and fiscal spending takes effect. 
Consumer price inflation has accelerated slightly. Annual headline inflation increased to 
0.5% in November. Looking ahead, subdued wage growth and expectations of stable 
inflation at low levels imply a weak reflation momentum in the economy.
 In the United Kingdom, 
economic activity appears to have slowed progressively 
over the fourth quarter of 2019.
 Confidence
 indicators remain subdued and well 
below their historical avera
ges. The outcome of the December election and the large 
majority obtained by Prime Minister Johnson remove the short
-term risk of a no
-deal 
Brexit at the end of January, as the Withdrawal Agreement has now become law. 
However,
 the United Kingdom is facing 
a tight deadline to reach an agreement on its 
future relationship with the European Union towards the end of 2020, and therefore 
policy uncertainty remains high.
 The preliminary trade agreement between the United States and China removes 
some of the obstac
les to Chinese economic activity and trade.
 China™s economy is 
showing signs of stabilisation and should benefit from the Phase
 1 trade deal with the 
United States. The trade agreement can further support growth by improving net trade 
and lowering 
trade
-related uncertainty. Meanwhile, annual headline CPI inflation 
stabilised in December at 4.5% but remained above the official target. The December 
reading remained elevated owing to ongoing high food price inflation stemming from the 
outbreak of Afric
an swine fever and its impact on pork prices. The latter rose by 97% in 
year
-on-year terms in December, down from 110% in November. At the same time, CPI 
inflation excluding energy and food remained unchanged at 1.4% in December.

 In a continuation of the trend that started in early 2019, equity prices of euro area 

financial
 and non

respectively in the review period. The positive development of NFC equity prices was 

supported by a reduction in the equity risk premi

 some 
relaxation of 
both 
global trade tensions and
 near-term risks related to

. Private consumption rose by 0.
5%, quarter
 on quarter
, in the 
third 
quarter of 2019, 
which is the strongest rate of expansion since the third quarter of 2017. 
Household

c slowdown. Annual growth of real gross disposable income rose from 
2.2

Overall, e
mployment growth has 
continued 
to 
support labour income. In addition, lower direct taxes and social 
security 
contribution
s, reflecting fiscal measures in a number of euro area countries
, have 
contributed positively to households™ purchasing power
. The savings ratio increased 
further in the third quarter of 2019 as income growth outpaced consumption growth.
 Looking ahead p
riv
ate consumption 
should
 continue to 
underpin growth in the 
euro area
. Recent data on the volume of retail sales and new passenger car 
registrations point to 
somewhat lower consumption growth 
in the 
fourth 
quarter of 
2019 compared with the previous quarter
. 
However, o
ther indicators support the 
picture of 
fairly robust 
consumption dynamics. 
Consumer confidence, which 
started to 
declin
e at 
the end of 2017, 
has 
stabilised 
and remained 
broadly 
steady over the 
course of 2019
. The latest survey results 
also 
signal 
continued, albeit slowing, 
employment growth, 
which should continue to support househol
d income and 
consumer spending.
 Business investment is expected to 
remain subdued 
Œ in a context of still 
elevated uncertainty and weak profit margins 
Œ but suppo
rted by 
favourable 
financing conditions
. According to the latest quarterly national accounts data for the 
euro area, non
-construction investment declined sharply in the third quarter of 2019 
(-7.7% quarter on quarter), following strong growth in the second
 quarter (10.3% 
quarter on quarter). However, this is mostly due to the incorporation of volatile Irish 
data for the most recent quarters, reflecting developments in investment in intellectual 
property products. Looking through this volatility, incoming da
ta suggest rather 
moderate or even negative investment growth in the euro area. For instance, annual

 Economic activity
  12 growth in investment in machinery and equipment has slowed gradually since 2018 
(see Chart 7). As regards near
-term development, i
n October and November 
2019 industrial production 
of capital goods stood, on average,1.4% below its average level 
in the previous quarter; in the period to December i
ndustrial confidence 
in the capital 
goods production sector stabilised at levels below its historical average. Desp
ite rising 
in the third quarter, firms™ profit margins remain weak in a context of ongoing elevated 
uncertainty. Moreover, a
ccording to the November 2019 EIB Investment Survey, the 
number of EU manufacturing firms planning to reduce investment in the next 
12 months has risen for the first time in four years
 (see Box 6 entitled ﬁ
Business outlook 
surveys as indicators of euro area real business investment
ﬂ). The 
softer
 investment 
outlook reflects more widespread expectations of 
a deterioration
 in the economic
, 
political and regulatory outlook over the next 12 
months. T
he E
uropean 
Commission 
biannual investment
 survey from 
the 
end of 
November also points to modest euro area 
industrial in
vestment growth in 2020
. On a more positive note, favourable financing 
cond
itions continue to support business investment.

 Notes: 
Non
-construction investment is 
decomposed into (a) machinery and equipment, and (b) investment in intellectual property 
products, excluding cultivated biological resources (which have a very small weight)
. The chart shows an aggregation of the four largest 
EU Member States™ data.
 Housin
g investment should maintain its moderate momentum over the near 
term, supported by buoyant demand and favourable financing conditions, but 
limited by supply
-side constraints
. According to the latest quarterly national 
accounts, construction investment and
 its housing component grew strongly in the 
third quarter (0.9% and 1.1% respectively, quarter on quarter), after a modest 
contraction in the previous quarter (
-0.3% and 
-0.1% respectively, quarter on quarter). 
Together with the latest outcomes for constru
ction production and building permits, 
short
-term and survey indicators suggest that the moderate growth momentum in 
housing investment is likely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2019. In this period 
housing investment is expected to be supported mainl
y by strong housing demand, as 
shown by rising spending intentions on housing and strong demand for housing loans, 
while some positive signals have also emerged on the supply side, in particular 
looking at the 
PMI for housing activity.

  13 Extra
 euro area expo
rts 
of goods show some signs of stabilisation, while 
imports and intra
-euro area trade weakened further in the fourth quarter of 
2019. After a 
rebound in export growth in the third quarter of 2019 (from negative 
growth in the previous quarter)
 preliminary 
trade goods data to November indicate a 
stabilisation of extra euro area exports, which have been characterised by pronounced 
volatility, most likely associated with stockpiling behaviour
 related 
to 
concerns about 
the possibility of a hard 
Brexit
 in Octobe
r 2019. Data show relatively resilient
 growth in 
export
s to 
the United States and a firming recovery 
in exports 
to 
Turkey
 and China, 
while exports to the rest of Asia remain subdued. On the other hand, i
ntra
-euro area 
goods 
exports and imports
 declined in 
October and November, reflecting weakness in 
euro area industrial production and activity
. The latest release of national accounts 
data shows a marked decline in imports in the third quarter of 2019, mostly driven by 
trade in services, which contracted strongly by 5.1% after posting 8.4% growth, 
quarter on quarter, in the second quarter. Howeve
r, this was mainly driven by Irish 
data. 
Leading indicators point to 
below
-trend
 dynamics for 
extra
-euro area exports. 
While t
he PMI 
for 
new manufacturing export orders 
improved to 47.3 (which is 
nevertheless still in contraction territory), 
the E
uropean 
Commission™s indicator on the
 assessment of 
export 
order books fell again in 
December
. 
At the same time, signals 
from s
hipping indicators 
are more positive
. Incoming data and survey 
results
 point to ongoing positive but moderate 
economic growth 
in the 
fourt
h quarter of 2019
. Weak global trade
, together with a 
prolonged 
period of 
uncertaint
y, continue to hamper the overall performance of output 
growth in the euro area
. For instance, industrial production 
stood below its average 
level in the third quarter, thu
s pointing to a further quarter
-on-quarter fall in production 
in the fourth quarter. 
As regards more timely survey data, in the 
fourth 
quarter
 both the 
European Commission™s 
ESI and the composite output PMI 
were
 below 
their 
respective 
average 
levels in the
 third quarter.
 Looking ahead the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by 
favourable financing conditions.
 In addition, growth 
is likely to
 be underpinned by 
further employment gains
 in conjunction with
 rising wages
, the mildly expansionary 
euro area fiscal stance
 and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ growth
 in global 
activity. The results of the latest round of the

 HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in December 2019, up from 1.0% in November 
2019. The increase reflected increases in energy inflation and, to a small extent also 
food inflation, more than offsetting a

 Annual growth
 in compensation per employee

3 Annual growth in wages and 
salaries per employee, which excludes social security contributions, was 2.6% in the 
third quarter, up from 2.5% in the second quarter. Looking across the different 
indicators and through temporary factors, wage growth has moved b
roadly sideways 
since mid
-2018, either at around or slightly above historical averages.
 Market
-based indicators of longer

slightly, while survey
-based expectations remained at the relatively low levels 
seen over the co
urse of 2019.
 As a result of the mild recovery, market

-based probability of deflation edged down, 
after increasing during most of 2019, and remains belo
w the levels observed prior to 
the announcement of the asset purchase programme in 2015. At the same time, the 
forward profile of market
-based indicators of inflation expectations continues to point 
to 
the risk of 
a prolonged period of low inflation. The r
esults of the 
ECB Survey of 
Professional Forecasters
 (SPF) for the first quarter of 2020 show average longer

inflation
 expectations to be unchanged at 1.7%. Together with average point forecasts 
for annual HICP inflation of 1.2%, 1.4% and 1.5% for 2020, 2021 and 2022

  18 Loans to the private sector 
have continued to grow at a solid rate.
 The annual 
growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation 
and notional cash pooling) 
stood at
 3.6% in 
November 2019
, 
after
 3.7% in 
October
 (see Chart
 11). 
This development was mainly 
due to 
a de
crease in the annual
 growth 
rate of loans to 
non-financial corporations (NFCs), which fell
 to 
3.4% in 
November
 from 3

 Overall, l

loans to 
households for house purchase 
remained 
broadly unchanged
.4 Compe
tition from other banks continued to contribute to an 
easing of credit standards for enterprises and households. 
In the case of
 loans to 
enterprises, there was a
 tightening impact stemming from
 risk perceptions related to 
the economic outlook. Credit terms
 and conditions (i.e. the actual conditions laid down 
in the loan contract) for 
new 
loans to enterprises and housing loans remained broadly 
unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2019. Loan demand 
from
 enterprises decreased for 
the first time since 
the fourth 
quarter of
 2013, reflecting the slowdown in economic 
activity observed since 2018, with financing needs for fixed investment ceasing to 
make a positive contribution to loan demand
, while 
the general low level of interest 
rates 
continued to 
support loan dem
and from

 Prepared by Alina Bobasu, André Geis, Lucia Quaglietti

 Martino 
Ricci
5 This box sheds light on the role 
of uncertainty in the recent slowdown of global 
investment and trade.
 Over the past year the global economy has transitioned from a 
robust and synchronised expansion to a widespread slowdown
. Global growth has 
weakened on the ba
ck of soft investment, which w
as also a 
key driver of the sharp fall 
in global trade 
growth in
 the first half of 2019
 (see Chart A)
6. 
The slowdown in global 
investment and trade has occurred in an environment of
 rising
 trade tensions
 between 
the United States and China
, slowing Chinese
 demand, (geo
-)political tensions, Brexit 
and idiosyncratic stresses in several emerging economies, 
with rising uncertainty
 magnifying 
the
 negative impact.
 Against this backdrop, 
this
 box 
assesses the role of
 uncertainty in the recent slowdown of global in

 Tracking global economic uncertainty: implications for global investment and trade
  21 Since u
ncertainty cannot be observed directly
, 
proxies
 are generally use
d. Economic uncertainty 
can stem from different sources and 
is characterised by a 
situation in which agents cannot contemplate all the possible states of nature or 
characterise their probability distributions. 
While t
he literature
 goes some way towards 
defining the concept of uncertainty, including 
by setting it apart from risk
 and confidence
8, 
there is no 
single commonly accepted 
measure
 of uncertainty. Several
 proxies have been proposed
, such as indicators based on
 stock market volatility
, counts of the w
ord ﬁuncertaintyﬂ in
 newspaper 
articles and measures based on 
disagreement between professional forecasters
.9 In this box we present synthetic measures of time
-varying macroeconomic 
uncertainty.
 Jurado et al. define 
economic uncertainty as the 
ﬁconditional
 volatility of 
a disturbance that is unforecastable from the perspective of economic agents
ﬂ10, with 
an increase 
in uncertainty 
generally being 
associated 
with
 a growing difficulty of 
predicting future economic outcomes.
 Based on this definition, we 
develop
ed measures of economic uncertainty for 16 euro area trading partners, together 
accounting for around 70% of world GDP (excluding the euro area)
. The measures 
were derived from the
 time
-varying
 volatility of 
model
-based forecast 
errors of a broad 
selection of 
macroeconomic and
 financial market 
time series.
11 Applying the same 
approach to a large selection of country trade indicators, we also derive
d a measure of 
global trade
 uncertainty
12. The estimation results suggest that while g
lobal economic uncertainty has 
increased gradually over the past year, global trade uncertainty has surged
 more rapidly.
 Trade
-related uncertainty has risen by some two standard deviations 
over the past year; more than twice the increase observed in econom
ic uncertainty 
(see 
Chart B). While our measures line up 
reassuringly well 
with
 past political, 
geopolitical and economic 
events generally associated with high uncertainty
, 
the 
recent intensification coincides with various tariff announcements made by the 
United 
States
 and China. For instance, the trade uncertainty indicator start
ed rising in 
mid
-2018 when US tariffs on steel and aluminium were announced
, and spiked again 
in the first quarter of 2019 after the U
nited 
States
 increased tariffs on USD 200
 bill
ion
 of imports from China. 
All countries in 
the
 sample (
except
 Switzerland) have 
experienced an increase in uncertainty since early 2018.
                                                                     8  For a review see Stracca

 11  In more detail, a (monthly) dynamic factor model 
is deployed 
to 
forecast
 country
-specific 
macro and 
financial varia
bles one month in advance
. A stochastic volatility model 
is then used 
to derive the 
conditional volatility of the model
-based forecast error over time. 
Thereafter,
 a principal component of the 
individual
 time series 
is extracted 
to produce a measure of 
economic uncertainty for each country. F
inally,

indi
cator

d by aggregating
 the country
-specific indicators
 using GDP PPP 
weights. Similarly,
 a measure of global trade uncertainty
 is derived from
 a large database of monthly 
country
-level 
trade indicators
. 12  The trade uncertainty indicator reflects
 the unforecastable component of a broad set of trade
-specific 
variables 
such as
 imports and exports.
 It therefore
 accounts for a variety of sources of 
trade 
uncertainty
, including, but not limited to trade policy uncertainty
. The proxy has been chosen bas
ed on the fact that 
gold is considered a safe asset and should therefore emphasise the uncertainty
-related component of the 
events.

 Following the global financial crisis, policy debates have increasingly focused 
on the macroeconomic consequences of heightened uncertainty.
 Recent ECB 
analysis suggest
s that 
rising 
uncertainty had negative effects on euro area investment 
during the global financial and euro area sovereign debt crises.
13 An often
-cited 
channel linking uncertainty 
to
 real activity is
 the
 irreversibility of investment
.14 Moreover, 
the interp
lay between uncertainty shocks and financial frictions can have 
powerful effects on 
economic
 activity.
15 Consumers
 may 
also 
react to increased 
uncertainty by 
raising their 
precautionary savings
.16 Economic uncertainty
 also
 appears to play an important role a
t the current 
juncture
. Analysing the causal relation
ship
 between fluctuations in uncertainty and 
output growth is not straightforward
 as 
causality 
can be bi
-directional: higher 
uncertainty affects economic activity, but (adverse) 
shock
s to output 
are also
 likely to 
raise 
uncertainty
. In order to distinguish 
exogenous 
shocks from 
uncertainty

 US yield curve inversion and financial market signals of recession
  25 2 US yield curve inversion and 
financial market signals of
 recession
 Prepared by 
Johannes Gräb and Stephanie Titzck
 The inversion of 
the 
US yield curve in mid
-2019 led to heightened concerns 
about
 a possible US recession.
 The US yield curve is often seen as 
a predictor of 
recessions: a 
flattening or inversion of the yield curve 
(or negative term spread
), in 
which interest rates at the long end 
are 
below those at the short end, has 
often 
been understood as a signal 
of 
an impending 
recession. In late summer 2019 the US yield 
curve inverted
 for the first time since the global financial crisis (
see 
Chart A). 
Global 
recession analyses may help assess risks to the economic outlook. 
This box presents 
an assessment of the probability of a recession in the 
United States
, taking into 
account 
developments that
 have 
distorted the signals derived from the current yield 
curve.

 Notes: 
The t
erm spread is the spread between the 
three
-month and 
ten
-year US Treasury yields. The US QE
-adjusted term spread is the 
spread adjusted for the effect of Federal Reserve 
QE 
on the 
ten
-year yield. The total QE
-adjusted term spread accounts for the effect of
 Federal Reserve and Eurosystem 
asset purchases on 
ten
-year US 
Treasury 
yields. The total QE and official holdings
-adjusted spread 
accounts for the effect of official holdings on the 
ten
-year yield in addition to the effect of
 US and euro area QE.
 The late
st 
observation
 is for
 Novem
ber 2019.
 Standard yield curve
-based recession probability models ignore factors that 
can distort the signals derived from the current yield curve.
20 Yield
 curve
-based 
recession models typically relate the probability of recession
 to a measure of the term 
spread 
Œ i.e. the difference between 
three
-month and
 ten
-year US Treasury yields. 
However, the term spread can be affected by factors that have depressed the term 
premium in longer
-term bond yields
 largely independent
ly of the dom
estic e
conomic 
outlook
. First, since the global financial crisis
, US long
-term yields have been 
compressed by asset purchases by the Federal Reserve
 System
. Although the

 US yield curve inversion and financial market signals of recession
  26 Federal Reserve ceased purchases some time ago and
, until the summer of 2019
, was in t
he process of reducing its holdings of bonds, the stock of bonds currently held 
on its balance sheet 
has 
continued to depress term premia on longer
-term bonds. 
Second, in the 
last few years
 US long
-term yields have been 
further 
compressed by 
the 
asset purc
hase programmes
 of foreign central banks
, such as the ECB. Foreign 
central banks™ 
asset 
purchase
s affect US yields through the international portfolio 
rebalancing channel of monetary policy. Third, since the early
 2000s the accumulation 
of US Treasury holdings by foreign central banks has 
also 
compressed longer
-term 
Treasury yields. As demand from foreign central banks is typically price
-inelastic, 
long
-term yield compression is likely to occur independent
ly of rece
ssion risks in the 
US economy. As a consequence, the signals from standard recession probability 
models based on the yield curve may be distorted.
 This box presents alternative recession probability models to deal with these 
possible distortions to the sig
nals from the yield curve.
 Specifically, term spread 
measures are constructed 
to 
adjust for the effects of asset purchase programmes and 
foreign central bank reser
ve accumulation. These measures
 are then included in a 
standard logit regression model to ass
ess the probability that a US recession 
will 
occur 
over 
a one
-year horizon
.21 A logit model is used to estimate the probability of a 
binary event 
Œ in this case the US economy 
being 
in recession 
Œ based on 
a number of 
explanatory variables. The following te
rm spread variants are used to estimate the 
probability of recession
: First, a term spread measure that corrects the US 
ten
-year yield for the effect of 
the Federal Reserve™s 
quantitative easing (
QE) programmes is constructed.
 To 
do so, the impact of the t
hree 
large
-scale asset purchase (
LSAP
) programmes, the 
maturity extension program
me and reinvestments on the US term premium for 
ten
-year government bond yields is assessed.
22 Adjusting the 
ten
-year yield for the 
effects of 
QE leads to a markedly larger dif
ference between the 
three
-month and 
ten
-year US Treasury yield (i.e. a wider term spread), in particular between 2012 and 
2018 (
see 
Chart A, yellow line). The adjusted term spread increases with the gradual 
expansion of the 
Federal Reserve 
balance sheet an
d peaks (at 124 basis points) in 
September 2014, just before the end of net asset purchases. 
The difference between 
the standard term spread and the US QE
-adjusted term spread narrowed 
during the 
Federal Reserve™s balance sheet normalisation between Octobe
r 2017 and August 
2019, but it still remains significant.
 Second, a term spread measure is derived 
to account 
for spillover effects on US 
yields of asset purchases by Eurosystem central 
banks (
see Chart A, red line).
 To do so, the correlation coefficient o
f the day
-on-day change in German Bund yields 
and US Treasury yields at 
ten
-year maturity following ECB 
asset purchase programme 
                                                                    21  The models control for corporate bond and stock marke
t misalignments by including the excess bond 
premium and the cyclically adjusted price
/earnings ratio.
 22  Estimates of the impact on the US term premium are based on Ihrig, J., Klee, E., Li, C, Wei, M. and 
Kachovec,
 J., ﬁExpectations about the Federal Rese
rve™s Balance Sheet and the Term Structure of

  27 (APP)
 announcements is calculated.
23 The total effect of 
the 
ECB
™s quantitative 
easing
 on US yields is then calculated by applying the correlation coefficient 
to 
the 
estimated effect of 
the 
Eurosystem
™s APP 
on the 
ten
-year euro area term premium.
2425 Finally, the US term spread is corrected for these spillovers from 
APP announcements 
by addin
g the est
imates to the US ten
-year yield.
 Third, a term spread measure that also takes into account the effect of foreign 
official reserve holdings of US Treasury bonds is constructed
 (see Chart A, 
green line).
 ECB estimates suggest that an increase 
in 
for
eign official holdings by 10 
percentage points of the outstanding stock of US government debt leads to a 
55 basis 
point
 fall in the term premium on US Treasuries.
26 Given observations of the amount 
of foreign official US dollar holdings as a share of total 
outstanding US government 
debt, it is possible to adjust the 
ten
-year yield for these effects. The official 
holdings
-adjusted term spread starts deviating noticeably from the standard term 
spread in the early 2000s
, when China and other emerging market eco
nomies started 
to increasingly accumulate US 
dollar 
reserves (
see 
Chart A). 
Since 2008 the term 
spread accounting for the effect of official holdings has
 on average
 been about 165 
basis points higher than the QE
-adjusted term spread.
 A model based on the s
tandard term spread may potentially overstate current 
recession probabilities compared to models that account for the effect of asset 
purchases.
 As shown in Chart B, in August 2019, at the point of 
the greatest 
yield 
curve inversion, the predicted one
-year
-ahead recession probability based on a model 
using the standard term spread was 37%. In contrast, the term spread adjustments 
proposed here point to markedly lower probabilities. The model that uses a term 
spread adjusted for US QE points to a probability
 of 28%.
27 Once the spillover effects 
of 
the APP
 on the US term spread is also adjusted for, the probability falls to 21%. 
Further 
adjustment
 for the effects of foreign official holdings on the term spread 
reduces the probability to just 12%.
28                                                                     23  The coefficient is 0.4, suggesting that an ECB 
APP
 announcement that lowers 
ten
-year 
German 
Bund 
yields by 10 basis points leads to a decline of 
4 basis points 
in 
US Treasury yields with the same maturity.

 Overall, models that account for the fact that the term premium in longer

bond yields, and thus the term spread, can be depressed by factors that are 
largely independent of the domestic economic outlook suggest a lower 
probability of a US recession than models based on the standard term spread.
 In August 2019, when model
-based recession probabilities peaked, the correction 
indicates a 9 to 25 basis points lower probability of a recession one year ahead 
compared to the stan
dard model. The model that accounts for US and euro area QE, 
which is found to be best performing in terms of statistical properties, implied a 
recession probability of 28%. Since August 2019 recession probabilities have declined 
across all models in line 
with a widening term spread
, driven in particular by an 
increase in long
-term government bond yields. This suggests a somewhat more 
benign outlook for the 
United States
 than suggested by 
market commentary in the 
summer of 2019.

  29 3 Breaking the

ﬂ of tariffs 
Œ foreign
 trade 
zones 
in the time of protectionism
 Prepared by Virginia di Nino, Simone Cigna and Srdan Tatomir
 In 
foreign
 trade 
zones (FTZs) 
imported 
goods can be
 handled, manufactured 
and re
-exported without the intervention of customs autho
rities.
 This box 
reviews the benefits of FTZs, 
how they are used
 in the U
nited 
States
,29 China
30 and the 
European Union (EU)
31 and whether they can cushion the rise in tariffs 
resulting 
from new trade restrictions.
32 FTZs were originally designed to promote ec
onomic development and 
employment by favouring international trade
. In FTZs
, processing trade and 
re-exported goods 
are exempt from import duties 
Œ other 
advantages include lower 
processing fees and 
deferred
 import duties
. There are also some disadvantages to 
FTZs. For example, existing businesses may simply relocate to a FTZ from elsewhere 
in the same country so as to benefit from lower duties or lower taxes. This can lead to 
a fall in government tax revenue without sizeab
le net positive effects on employment 
and economic activity.
33 With these advantages and disadvantages in mind, the 
extent to which countries benefit from FTZs is highly context
-dependent.
 In several 
countries, the number of FTZs has grown 
over the past two
 decades 
as governments 
have tried to encourage
 global production on their territor
ies.
 FTZs can break the ﬁchain effect
ﬂ of tariffs 
to 
the extent that parts and 
components
 (otherwise known as intermediate goods)
 are either
 exempted 
from duties when 
they are 
re-exported or
 can 
enter the market 
at favourable 
rates
. In
 the U
nited 
States,
 tariff rates are higher on intermediate
 goods than on final 
products (
in what is known as 
tariff inversion)
, but 
inputs imported through FTZ
s can 
be exempted from dutie
s or levied
 the 
lower 
final product
 tariff rate. Furthermore, the 
value 
created w
ithin FTZ
s is domestic and therefore shielded from US taxation on 
foreign imports.
 Instead of paying a tariff on each imported intermediate good entering 
production of
 final g
oods, firms can take advantage of FTZs to break this ﬁchainﬂ of 
tariffs by only paying the applicable tariff on the foreign value added of the finished 
item. Alternatively, they can transform and manufacture the goods in FTZs and then 
re-export them elsewh
ere without paying US import tariffs. 
Products manufactured 
within 
global value chains (
GVC
s) obtain the greatest cost
-saving benefits from FTZ
s, as they typically cross borders repeatedly and would otherwise be 
subject to duties
 at 
each border. In the absence of FTZ
s, tariffs would pile up on GVC products
 because
 they are levied on the gross value of the item and not on the value added at each 
                                                                    29  For a complete list of FTZs in the United States, see the ﬁ

  30 stage.
 According to t
he US National Association of Foreign
-Trade Zones,
 roughly
 half 
of the costs firms save
 by locating in FTZs
 are due to tariff inversion avoidance.
34 In the United States, FTZs handle a substantial share of total imports (around 
38% in 2018).
 However, those imports that are considered to have ﬁforeign statusﬂ and 
receive f
avourable treatment account for only 14% of total imports.
35 Around half of the 
foreign
-status imports eventually enter US domestic borders for final consumption, while 
the rest are processed and re
-exported. In 2018, 440,000 workers were employed in US 
FTZ
s. Besides oil, which transits through US FTZs for historical reasons, the bulk of 
imports entering the United States via FTZs are made up of electronic items, machinery 
and transportation goods with global production networks.
36 Foreign car makers take 
advantage of tariff inversion by locating inside FTZs.
37 FTZs 
in China also account for a significant and growing share of overall trade.
 While relief from import duties is not currently a feature of FTZs in China, this has been 
under consideration and may cha
nge as part of the continued expansion of FTZs.
 In 
China, there are currently 12 large FTZs. These
 zones
 employ 4% of the workforce 
and handle
 goods representing around
 17% of total Chinese 
imports
. 
As in
 the U
nited 
States
, 
around 
half of 
these goods are
 for domestic consumption and half 
are 
for 
re-export. Electronics and machinery imported through FTZs 
account for
 20% of 
imports in their respective sectors (
see 
Chart A), while transport goods make up 25% 
of imports in
 that
 sector. Firms located in FTZs (as
 well as in 
other 
special economic 
zones) can 
also 
take advantage of looser capital controls and tax advantages.

  31 In the EU, 
no duty waiver is granted to imports passing through FTZs
 because
 FTZs 
are mainly used to 
smooth out customs processes
 Œ instead
 a similar 
effect is achieved via an import duty suspension scheme.
38 This
 scheme,
 introduced in 2013
, 
guarantee
s a level playing field to companies operating in the 
EU 
irrespective of their geographical location. The share of
 euro area
 imports 
under 
suspension arrangements 
is comparable to imports through FTZs
 in other regions
 (12% of 
euro area
 imports
 are under suspension arrangements, while
 17% of imports 
into
 China and 1
4% of imports 
into
 the U
nited 
States take place through FTZs
). In line 
with the original 
aim of FTZs
, the duty suspension
 scheme
 primarily 
concerns
 intermedi
ates
. Capital goods benefit to a 
lesser
 extent, whereas consumer goods 
account for a 
negligible
 fraction 
of all euro area imports under suspension 
arrangements 
(see Chart B). 
However, since the ultimate scope is to support domestic 
production and the devel
opment of regional value chains,
 only items
 that are
 not 
produced within the EU can be granted duty suspension
s; in particular neither cars nor
 car parts 
have ever been included on the suspension list.

. Note: The 
list of 
suspension
s is revised twice a year
, and suspensions from 
customs
 duties can be granted for up to 
five
 years
. FTZs
 can cushion the impact of the US
-China
 trade war, depending on the 
relative size of 
the 
tariffs on intermediates 
compared with those
 on final 
goods.
39 Increasing t
ariff
s on intermediates relative to final goods 
generates a 
greater
 incentive to 
import through FTZs in the U
nited 
States in order
 to take 
advantage of import duty exemptions. In the ongoing 
trade war between China and the 
United States
, 
around 90% of Chinese 
intermediate goods 
were 
affected by 
a rise in

 for this approach is
 that exemption
 from 
import duties using
 FTZs would constitute an unfair 
competitive advantage for companies located 
in FTZs compared with
 those loc
ated elsewhere in the

tariff inversion

the 
incentive to

Recourse to

US-China 
tariff rate by 
up to

Assuming that the share of Chinese intermediates entering production in US FTZs is the same as the 
share of imported Chinese intermediates in total US intermed
iate imports, the cushioning effect of FTZs 
may be up to 0.7 percentage points. Furthermore, if we assume that all imported Chinese intermediates 
(USD 149 billion in 2017) are rerouted through FTZs, this could lead to a one
-third reduction in the impact 
on
 the bilateral effective tariff. For example, this would result in a rise of 9.8 percentage points instead of 
14.2 percentage points. Since the data on US FTZ trade composition are limited, we make assumptions 
about the share of imports of Chinese intermed
iates entering production in US FTZs. We also assume 
that all foreign inputs that enter FTZs for production are channelled towards the US domestic market for 
final consumption (i.e. not re
-exported). In addition, we assume that all Chinese intermediate imp
orts 
have been affected by a 25 percentage point increase in tariffs, while tariffs on consumer goods have 
only increased by 7.5 percentage points. These are reasonable assumptions, as 83% of Chinese 
intermediates in total US intermediate imports from Chin
a have been affected by a 25 percentage point 
increase in the tariff rate. At the same time, almost 70% of Chinese consumer goods in total US 
consumer goods imports from China have been targeted by an increase in tariffs equal to or lower than 
7.5 percenta
ge points.

central and eastern European 
EU countries 
in 
global 
value 
chains, expor
t dynamics, and 
business cycle synchronisation with the

 Prepared by Francesco Chiacchio and Andrejs Semjonovs
 This box reviews developments in 
the six non
-euro area central and eastern 
European EU 
countries
 (Bulgaria, 
the 
Czech Republic, Croatia,
 Hungary, Poland 
and Romania) 
with respect to 
trade integration and economic synchroni
sation 
with the euro area and investigates 
the 
potential exposure of their export 
dynamics to changing external conditions.
 In recent decades, 
in an environment of 
rapid 
economic globali
sation
 and increasing trade integration,
 firms
 have unbundled
 their
 production processes 
and scattered their input sourcing 
across countries. This 
has been particularly true for 
the six 
countries 
under review
, which have become 
increasingly integrated in cross
-border value chains both globally and regionally. More 
specifically, access to the Single Market 
has 
entailed 
the
 removal of trade barriers, 
lower transport costs and harmoni
sed EU
-wide standards, which 
have 
provided a 
decisive stimulus for firms to 
fragment 
their production and assembly operations to 
take advantage of 
local production conditions.
 The six
 countries have strong trade ties and are well integrated with the euro 
area and the rest of the EU.
 Over the last 20 years, 
the euro area has been 
the 
destination of more than 55% of 
the 
total exports of the 
six countries 
(see 
Chart 
A). By 
2014 around 45% of 
their 
gross exports to the euro area were 
related to global value 
chains (
GVC
s),
 i.e. containing 
either 
foreign value
 added or domestic value
 added for 
other 
countr
ies™
 exports. Moreover, 
on average the six
 countries are positioned 
downstream
42 in euro area value 
chains (see Chart B
), which suggests that the region 
is generally speciali
sed in processing
 and assembly functions and that its 
overall 
export activit
ies
 are therefore 
characteri
sed by relatively low domestic value
-added content and more intense use of foreign intermediate inputs.
                                                                     42  The position
 in global value chains 
reflects
 the
 relative
 proportion 
of two components of gross exports: 
(i) domes
tic value added embedded in other countries™ exports (upstream
 GVC participation); and (ii) 
foreign value added embedde
d in own 
exports (downstream
 GVC participation).
 A country is situated 
downstream in the value chain when 
foreign inputs 
(in terms of value added) in the production of its 
exports 
are greater than the 
input
s it provides 
for the production of other countries™ export
s. See also

in total gross exports. In the purely hypothetical case of 100% domestic (foreign) value added, the position index maximum (m
inimum) 
value would therefore be 69 (
-69). 
The higher the share of foreign value added, the lower the 
GVC position index
; a negative value 
indicates a downstream position
 (as in the case of the EU6 aggregate)
, a positive value an upstream position
 (as in the cases of Croatia, 
Romania and Poland)
. GVC position and participation data are only available until
 2014 and might not reflect current GVC position

penness of 
the six 
countries to international markets

largely
 involves euro area partners, has 
been accelerating well above that of the euro area average.
 The high level of

 Integration of non

obal value 
chains, export dynamics, and business cycle synchronisation with the euro area
  36 supported by strong wage growth and increases in disposable income
 (as was broadly 
the case in all of the six economies). Moreover, the six
 economies are expected to 
grow faster th
an the euro area as a result of a catching
-up process. This trend 
differential suggests that
, in general,
 activity developments in the euro area may not 
be exactly mirrored in
 the six countries.
 Finally, 
lingering
 effects of 
past foreign direct 
investment 
in industry and 
the 
continued
 relocation of production 
from 
plants 
elsewhere in the EU to the six countries might also partially explain widening gaps in 
the short term

. Notes: The chart reflects the extent of synchronisation in economic activity between the six economies and the euro area. For
 example, 
GDP growth in the Czech Republic was highly correlated with that of the euro area in the deca
de up to 2018 (as indicated by correlation 
coefficients close to the maximum value of 1), while it has become less correlated more recently.
 The latest 
observation
 is for the third quarter of 2019
. The nature and final use of exports play an important role
 in explaining the 
correlation between 
exports of 
the euro area and 
the six countries
. For example,
 the recently weaker export growth in Romania can be largely attributed to the 
automotive sector, which accounts for about one
-third of goods 
exported 
to Ger
many. 
In particular, 
one of 
the main contributors to the downturn 
was 
auto parts and 
accessories, a sub
-sector 
that is highly 
integrated in cross
-border supply chains and 
dependent on 
the 
external demand
 of other countries
. By contrast, 
a large part 
of 
Bul
garian exports to Germany are not re
-exported but used for final consumption. 
Since the slowdown in Germany mainly 
stems 
from export
-oriented industrial sectors,
 it has a more limited effect on Bulgaria™s exports.
 So far, t
he ongoing moderation in manufact
uring, including 
in 
the automotive 
industry in Germany, 
and 
the escalation of trade tensions have been only partly 
                                                                    46  At the same time,

  38 5 Bond 
market liquidity and swap market efficiency 
Œ what
 role does the repo market play?
 Prepared by Jan Philipp Fritsche, Michael Grill and Claudia Lambert
 This box 
assesses the relevance of repo markets for bond and swap markets, 
thereby adding to the d
iscussion
 on the role of repo markets in the 
wider 
financial system.
 In a repurchase agreement, or ﬁrepoﬂ, securities
 are sold and
 an agreement 
is entered into 
to repurchase the
m at a later date.
 Typically, repos are used 
by market participants to obtain funding using bonds as collateral.
 They can also be 
used to source specific securities against cash collateral. R
epo markets
 play a key 
role in facilitating the flow of cash and securities around 
the financial syste
m, thereby 
providing liquidity to other markets.
 49 A well
-functioning repo market 
supports the 
implementation of monetary policy as it propagates interest rate decisions through the 
financial system. At the same time, turmoil in repo mar
ket may spill over to other 
markets and amplify financial market stress. This box is concerned with the effects of 
repo market disruptions on bond markets and the interest rate swap market. Given the 
importance of these markets in the financial system, the
ir proper functioning and the 
potential for repo market turmoil to affect it matters from both a financial stability and a 
monetary policy perspective.
50 The analysis
 provides 
empirical 
evidence that repo market liquidity is an 
important determinant of bond
 market liquidity and arbitrage opportunities in 
swap markets.
 Repo market liquidity plays a key role in supporting the liquidity of 
bonds used as collateral in repo transactions. This important link between funding and 
market liquidity has been discussed 
since the seminal contribution by Brunnermeier 
and Pedersen.
51 Repo markets also play an important role in the pricing and hedging 
of interest rate swaps.
52 The 
box investigates the 
effects of 
a sudden reduction in repo market liquidity
 at the end of a quart
er 
on the
 liquidity of bond 
markets 
and 
arbitrage in 
swap 
markets
. Repo market liquidity 
generally falls 
at quarter 
or year
-ends. This 
is primarily 
driven by banks

  39 specific regulatory 
metrics that they need to report and disclose on these days.
53 As 
repos typically 
have 
a very short maturity (
one to five
 days), they are 
often
 used to 
swiftly 
adjust
 the ba
lance sheet of a bank by reducing leverage at quarter and 
year
-ends, 
affect
ing
 the r
epo markets
 as transaction volumes drop.
54 The results of the first exercise show that bond market liquidity 
Œ measured by 
bid
-ask spreads 
Œ decreases significantly when repo markets are facing a 
sudden reduction in liquidity.
 The bid
-ask spread is the diff
erence between the bid 
price and the ask price of a security. 
It
 is a measure of transaction costs and 
tends to 
decrease 
when a security is more liquid.
 Chart A shows that d
uring the last 
few 
trading 
days of 
2018 (when repo market liquidity significantly d
ropped) 
the bid
-ask spread 
increase
d significantly for 
bonds which are used very often as collateral in repo 
markets and hence are judged to generally benefit from funding liquidity in
 the repo 
market
 (represented by the ﬁtreatment groupﬂ). Bonds which are
 very infrequently 
used as collateral and therefore do not benefit from funding liquidity in the repo market 
(the ﬁcontrol groupﬂ) were not affected and their bid
-ask spread remained at the same 
level.
55 These results are confirmed using an estimated model 
which measures the 
difference between the increase in the bid
-ask spread for the treatment group and the 
increase for the control group.
56 Table A 
shows
 the
 regression
 results for 
the five 
quarters considered. T
he bid
-ask spread increase
 is significantly
 higher for the 
treatment group at all quarter
-ends, and even more so at year

database
. For each quarter
, the 
500 
bonds 
most frequently used as collateral in the repo market are identified as the treatment group. For 
this set of bonds, the repo market can be considered an important provider of funding liquidity. 
The
 control group 
comprises
 bonds used so infrequently as coll
ateral that they do not benefit from any 
funding liquidity provided by the repo market
. The dataset contains both general collateral and special 
collateral trades. All transactions where an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is 
reported 
for the collateral 
Œ the large majority 
Œ are considered.
 56  On the basis of the treatment and control groups defined above
, a difference
-in-difference
s estimation 
technique conditional on propensity score matching is employed. 
While there are structural d
ifferences in 
the liquidity of 
the 
bonds 
in the two groups, these structural factors are constant over time and the 
difference
-in-differences approach is able to control for the time
-invariant factors. 
The matching 
procedure ensure
s that 
the two
 groups of 
bonds are similar before quarter
-ends and 
thus
 that 
the
 results 
do not reflect systematic differences between 
them
. In particular, bonds 
are matched on the 
bas
is of key 
characteristics that determine liquidity such as life to maturity, the modified duratio
n, the yield, the market 
value and the spread to a government benchmark of the bond. 
The

includes time fixed effects and bond fixed effects.

If, for

 the

the market participant can 
enter a swap with the 
obligation to pay 
a fixed rate of 
0.9% and earn the 0.1
 percentage point
 difference
60 (as a result of which the negative swap spread should ultimately disappear). This 
arbitrage scheme is, however, only economically viable if market pa
rticipants can rely 
on well
-functioning repo and bond markets.

of the underlying bond.
 59  The bond can be pledged as collateral in a repo.

The diagram depicts

 transaction
s where a market participant

 and then funds

. The market participant 
then

 Theory
 predict
s that frictions in the repo markets will result in a 
decrease in the
 swap spread.
 Recent research would predict that a sudden reduction in repo market 
liquidity at the end of a quarter decreases arbitrage opportunities in swap markets.
62 Swap traders can be affected by the repo market directly and indirectly
. They 
may be 
affected directly w
hen they use the repo market to fund 
a bond transaction, 
and they may 
be affected indirectly
 when
 the liquidity of the bond market changes 
as a 
result of
 changes in the liquidity 
of the
 repo market. Below, the effect on the swap 
market v
ia the bond market is referred to as the indirect 
effect
, 
and the effects from the 
repo mark
et on the bond market are referred to as the direct effect.
 The empirical analysis shows that swap spreads
 decrease 
significantly
, even if 
they are already negative
, when both repo markets and bond markets 
become 
less liquid
. An estimated model shows that t
he swap spread 
for the treatment group 
decreases 
by 
up to 13 basis points relative to the control
 group, through the direct 
effect (see Table B). Notably, t
he indi
rect effect is more pronounced at some 
quarter
-ends. This shows that a reduction in either repo or bond market liquidity leads 
to lower swap market efficiency.

 Overall, the analysis presents evidence on the links from repo markets to bond 
and swap markets.
 It shows the potential of repo market disruptions to spill over to 
other markets by incr
easing volatility of bid
-ask spreads in bond markets and limiting 
the potential for arbitrage in swap markets. 
From a financial stability perspective
, 
ensuring the resilience and sustainability of repo markets in order to limit the potential 
for sudden dis
ruptions and the amplification of stress in key markets such as the bond 
and swap market is therefore a relevant goal for policymakers. The potential for repo 
market turmoil to spill over to other markets matters also from a monetary policy 
perspective, as
 interest rate volatility can impair the transmission mechanism. Finally, 
the results reinforce the need to implement the recent recommendations of the Basel

 Investment survey indicators can be useful for assessing business investment 
development

. The 
Global 
Business Outlook Survey on future 
business conditions is produced 
by IHS Markit on a triannual basis
, 
with data collected 
in February, June and October
, thus providing more timely information compared with 
other available 
investment surveys.
 As indicated by IHS Markit, q
uestionnaires are 
sent to a representative panel of manufacturing and service
s sector
 firms, which are 
carefully 
selected to reflect the 
economic 
structure of each 
country
 in terms of sectoral 
contribution t
o GDP, regional distribution and 
firm
 size. 
Furthermore, its
 harmoni
sed methodology allows for direct comparison
s of business expectations across euro area 
countries
, which is particularly useful for monitoring ongoing developments in 
business investment a
nd policy assessments.
 The outlook for manufacturing investment has 
deteriorated
 since mid
-2018, 
indicating
 subdued 
business investment in a context of heighten
ed global 
uncertainty an
d sector
-specific challenges (see Chart A).
 Indicators have shown 
diverg
ences
 in the 
business 
investment outlook across sectors 
over the
 past 
few 
years, 
with the sharp downward trend in manufacturing being accompanied by a 
delayed, and more contained, decline in 
the investment outlook for 
services. Growing 
uncertainty related 
to geopolitical events
, such as Brexit and the further escalation of 
trade tensions
, have
 been reported 
to adversely affect investment
 in the latest

 vary between 
-100 and 100. Values above 0 
therefore 
indicate
 a positive outlook
 amongst firms regarding 
business
 investment 
in the coming 12 months, while values below 0 
can be interpreted as
 a deterioration and a value of 0 
as a neutral outlook
. Business expectations available as of October 2019 point to a further 
deterioration 
in
 the 
euro area
 outlook for manufacturing investmen
t in the near 
term
. The
 composite 
investment outlook (
albeit
 in positive territory) declined 
substantially in October, driven by
 contractionary
 manufacturing investment 
expectations
 (in negative territory for the first t
ime since 2012)
, in parallel with a 
non-negligible 
decline
 in services investment expectations. 
This is in line with the 
latest evidence from the biannual European Commission™s (EC) Industrial Investment 
Survey, in which 
expectations for
 annual manufacturi
ng investment growth in 2019 
were
 revised down
wards
 significantly
 in the euro area, from 
4% in the April 
2019 survey 
to 
-2% in November 2019
.65 According to the survey results, s
ubdued investment is expected in most industrial sectors, with large industrial
 firms accounting 
for the downward revision to invest
ment plans in 2019
. Furthermore, a
ccording to the 
2019 EIB Investment Survey, 
the number of manufacturing firms planning to reduce 
investment in 2019 
had increased
 for the fi
rst time in the past four 
years.
66 Country and sectoral

sector as 
a key 
driver
 behind the

 suggest 
differences 
across 
countries 
and sectors, with an investment outlook that remains positive in France and 
Italy, while 
there appears to be 
a marked deterioration 
in investment expectations in 
Germany and Spain. Overall, 
business

 Household wealth and consumption in the euro area
  46 Articles
 1 Household weal
th and consumption in the euro area
 Prepared by Gabe de Bondt, Arne Gieseck and Mika Tujula
 1 Introduction
 Household wealth is the difference between the value of 
a household™s 
assets 
and 
the value of its 
liabilities 
and 
is 
one of the 
key determinant
s of p
rivate 
consumption.
 Increases in wealth 
can 
affect private consumption in the short
 run, as 
households may feel richer and become more confident. Moreover, the level of 
household wealth is an important factor driving longer
-term consumption choices and 
gro
wth. Together with future expected labour income, it determines the level of 
life
-long resources available to households. As private consumption is by far the 
largest contributor to total economic activity, household wealth may have a substantial 
impact on
 the 
state of the economy
 and, ultimately
, on the outlook for inflation. In turn, 
monetary policy 
may 
have an impact on wealth developments, not only via its impact 
on asset prices but also through transmission channels. Therefore, it is important to 
consi
der levels of and 
changes in wealth 
when determining 
the appropriate monetary 
policy stance.
 The potential importance of household wealth has led to a rich theoretical and 
empirical literature on its effects on private consumption.
 There is abundant 
litera
ture on wealth effects in the United States and other individual countries which 
has produced a wide range of estimated elasticities of private consumption to 
wealth.
67 This article focuses on the effect of household wealth on the euro area 
economy and its 
four largest countries. The article primarily makes use of sector 
accounts data, which provide a detailed overview and consistent recording of 
non-financial and financial transactions and balance sheets at the institutional sector 
level in the euro area an
d in its member countries.
 This article focuses on wealth effects at the aggregated household sector level 
rather than 
on wealth effects at the household level.
 Apart from the 
above
-mentioned macroeconomic channels, which consider the impact on 
consumption
 of changes in the wealth of the total household sector, wealth can also 
have macroeconomic effects through distributional changes at the micro and 
individual household level. For example, if rising wealth accrues mostly to rich 
households, it would add to
 inequality and its macroeconomic impact might also be 
more limited, as rich households tend to have a lower marginal propensity to consume 
and might not step up their spending significantly.
                                                                     67  For

 Household wealth and consumption in the euro area
  47 Section 2 describes 
developments in household wealth since 1999 
based on the 
sector accounts and refers briefly to the distribution of wealth across households in 
2014 based on the Eurosystem™s latest available Household Finance and 
Consumption Survey. Section 3 provides estimates of wealth effects and the role they 
have played in recent years. Section 4 concludes with a look at monetary policy 
implications.
 2 Household wealth developments
 The sector accounts provide a comprehensive framework 
for the analysis of 
household wealth developments.
 The
 financial accounts include detailed 
information on financial positions, financial transactions and other flows in the 
economy
, by institutional sector and financial instrument. 
Non
-financial accounts 
contain
, inter alia, 
data on income, 
consumption, savin
gs, investment and 
non-financial asset
 holdings
.68 Households hold non
-financial and financial wealth.
 Non
-financial wealth mostly
 reflect
s dwellings 
and land underlying dwellings 
owned by households
, but also
 includes 
assets
 owned by unincorporated househo
ld enterprises.
69 Non
-financial 
assets
 can provide important additional 
resources, 
either through their sale or 
refinancing or as income via
, 
for example
, the letting 
of residential property. 
Owner
-occupied dwellings also have, in principle, an effect on co
nsumption insofar as 
the owner does not have to pay rent and thus has more money for other consumption. 
In the national accounts, this is taken into account by considering rent as consumption 
of services and imputing consumption and income flows of the sam
e amounts to the 
owners of owner
-occupied dwellings.
 It is important to note that landlords are better off 
as a result of higher house prices, whereas current and future tenants are worse off.
 However, tenants and landlords balance each other out, meaning 
that, on average, 
the inhabitants of a country own the dwellings in which they live, so there is no 
economy
-wide housing wealth effect from this perspective.
70 Financial 
wealth 
consists of financial 
assets, such 
as holding
s of deposits
, 
bonds, 
equity
 and investment fund 
shares
. These 
are an important source of 
cash flow
, either through 
the sale of 
such 
assets or 
through investment 
income (such as interest and dividends)
. However, p
ension entitlements are only included 
in the financial wealth of households 
in the sector accounts 
if they relate to (funded) employment
-related 
private or civil 
service 
schemes.
 Social security pensions
, which
 consist primarily of pensions related 
                                                                    68  For an overview of data availability, see Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European 
Union (
OJ L 174, 26.6.2013, p. 1
) and Guideline of the ECB of 25 July 2013 on the statistical reporting 
requirements of the ECB in the field of quarterly financial accounts (recast) (ECB/2013/24) (

7.1.2014, p. 34
). See also ﬁ

 69  To improve comparability across countries, non
-financial wealth includes only housing wealth in this 
section
, as 
data on 
other types of non
-financial wealth are not available for all countries. This 
means
 that 
the assets owned by unincorporated businesses are not included.
 70  This is the case if the role of non
-residents in owning and letting housing in the country is limited.

 Household wealth and consumption in the euro area
  48 to pay
-as-you
-go systems and make up the bulk
 of the total estimated stock of pension 
entitlements
 in nearly all euro area countries, are not included in household wealth.
71 Household wealth is typically captured by the sector accounts concept 
ﬁhouseholds
™ net worthﬂ, which is the value of the total a
ssets of households 
minus the value of their total outstanding liabilities.
 Any
 changes in the stock of 
wealth over a period are the result of t
hree
 components: net acquisitions of assets
, valuation changes 
and other volume changes
. Net acquisitions of non
-financial assets 
mostly reflect net purchases less depreciation of dwellings and correspond to net 
housing investment; net acquisitions of financial assets are the net investment in those 
assets. Valuation changes are mostly captured by the development of
 house prices 
(for non
-financial assets) and equity prices.
72 The stock of households™ net worth in the euro area amounts to around seven 
times annual disposable income, highlighting the importance of wealth for 
household economic resources.
 Chart
 1 shows t
hat households™ net worth 
increased strongly from some 550% of disposable income in 2002 to around 700% in 
2007, after 
having remained 
broadly stable in 2000
-01, when the bursting of the 
dotcom bubble and the September 2001 terrorist attacks dampened finan
cial wealth
 growth
 considerably
. The rise in net worth between 2002 and 2007 mostly reflected 
the strong housing market dynamics and house price increases witnessed in several 
countries during this period, which resulted in a marked increase in housing wea
lth 
that was partly financed by increased debt.
73 Thereafter, as the global financial crisis 
erupted and concerns about the sustainability of prevailing asset price levels and 
private sector indebtedness increased, households™ net worth declined significant
ly as 
a percentage of disposable income, reflecting declines in both financial and housing 
wealth. The decline in households™ net worth amounted to •1.7 trillion between 
mid
-2008 and early 2009. Following the strengthening of the economy and a recovery 
in 
asset prices, net worth increased slightly in 2009
-10, before moderating again in the 
context of the European sovereign debt crisis, when net worth contracted by some 
•0.5 trillion between mid
-2011 and early 2013. Since 2013 households™ net worth has 
incre
ased steadily, and it stood at 710% of disposable income in mid
-2019. Net worth 
growth has been supported by a further easing of monetary policy, resulting in an 
easing of financing conditions. This, together with the strengthening of the world 
economy, ha
s led to an improvement in the euro area economy, higher asset prices 
and increases in housing and financial wealth.
                                                                     71  See ﬁ

 72  Other volume changes relate to: (i) normal appearance and disappearance of assets and liabilities other 
than by transactions; (ii) changes in assets 
and liabilities due to exceptional events which are not 
economic in nature; and (iii) changes in statistical classification and structure. For valuation changes, 
movements in asset prices other than house and equity prices may also play a role.

 Notes: 
Households™ net worth is defined as the sum of their housing wealth and financial wealth net of their debt liabilities. 
Household
s™ housing wealth includes 
dwellings
 and land underlying dwellings.
 Debt liabilities are defined as total liabilities net of equity issued and 
mainly consist of loans received from banks. The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2019.
 Changes in the net worth of euro area househ
olds are primarily driven by 
valuation gains and losses on real estate holdings.
 Chart 2 shows 
that 
their 
impact
 on net worth growth was particularly strong during the housing market booms 
experienced in a number of countries between 2002 and 2007 and betw
een 2017 and 
mid
-2019. Capital gains and losses on financial asset holdings have occasionally also 
significantly affected net worth growth. This was especially the case during 2001
-02 when the dotcom bubble burst, in September 2001 in the wake of the terro
rist attacks 
and in 2008 after the global financial crisis erupted. In contrast, the contribution of net 
savings to net worth growth remained relatively stable between 2000 and mid
-2019. 
Chart 3 shows that valuation gains and losses on households™ real est
ate and financial 
asset holdings have followed changes in house and stock prices
 very closely, with 
correlations of 0.96 and 0.92, respectively. In addition, house price volatility is lower 
than stock price volatility and 
the house price cycle 
can 
deviate 
substantially from the 
stock price cycle.

 Chart 5
 shows that the share of housing wealth in euro area households™ total assets 
increased from some 50% in 1999 to around 62% in 2008, supported by strong 
housing market dynamics and house price increases in a number of countries. 
Thereafter, the sha
re declined until 2016, before increasing again slightly and 
stabilising close to the average pre
-crisis level. Throughout this period the share of 
housing wealth in total assets has been much higher in Spain than in other large euro 
area countries, while 
in Germany it has been considerably lower for most of the time. 
The differences observed 
between countries 
in 
the share of housing wealth in total 
assets reflect a number of factors. These include differences in home ownership 
ratios, attitudes towards ris

 Detailed statistics are collected and compiled by the Eurosystem regarding the most tradable assets 
held by households (as well as other institutional sectors), namely debt securities, listed shares and 
investment fund shares
.79 In the five years from 
the first quarter of 
2014 to 
the first quarter of 
2019, households™ total holdings of 
these securities increased slightly at euro area level, from 
•3,539 billion to 
•3,707 billion. This 
increase
 was mainly driven by German households
™ holdings
, 
which grew 
by 
•246 billion
. At the same 
time,
 holdings in Italy 
decreased 
by 
•223 billion,

 For all instruments and most countries, the majority of the securities held were issued by residents of 
the same country, which may be regarded as evidence of a ﬁhome biasﬂ (see Table A). In the
 largest 
euro area countries
, for listed shares
, 
this bias
 tends to 
be strongest 
in France and Spain, while being 
less pronounced in Italy. 
As regards debt securities, there is a 
marked preference for domestic debt 
securities 
in Italy
, 
where 
75% of 
the 
holdings
 are
 securities 
issued by Italian residents (down from 
83% in 
the first quarter of 
2014). Other large euro area countries also show a high proportion of 
domestic holdings, 
albeit 
to a lesser extent.

 The value of debt securities held by euro area households dropped substantially 
between the 
first
 quarter of
 2014 and the first
 quarter of
 2019. This 
largely 
reflect
s net sales by
 households
 (as 
opposed to price changes) in a period marked by large purchas
es of debt securities by the 
Eurosystem 
under 
the asset purchase programme (APP). The sales were driven 
mainly 
by Italian 
households, wh
ich
 decreased their holdings of debt securities significantly, 
although 
their holdings 
still remained much larger than t
hose of 
households 
in 
other euro area countries. The most prominent 
issuers of these securities were 
monetary financial institutions (
MFIs
) and 
the Italian government. The 
overall decline in holdings of non
-euro area debt securities mainly reflected a net 
•22 
billion reduction 
in holdings of UK debt securities.

 In parallel to disinvesting in debt securities, euro area households purchased, on a net basis, 
investment fund shares amounting to •402 billion over five years. As the prices of these securities 
also increased significantly over this period
, portfolios of investment fund
 shares held by households 
increased by 
•598 billion
 overall. The increase was mostly due to German, Spanish and Italian 
households, 
while there was 
a slight disinvestment by French households. Holdings of non
-euro area 
inves
tment fund shares 
remained very 
limited (
only
 •12 billion in 
the first quarter of 
2019).
 The value of euro area households™ holdings of listed shares increased between the first quarter of 
2014 and the first quarter of 2019. However, this reflected a rise 
in prices over this period, excluding 
which there were net sales of listed shares. The price increases were led mainly by shares issued by 
non-financial corporations. Meanwhile
, the 
value of 
holdings of shares issued by MFIs slightly 
decreased over 
the
 period, due 
both 
to 
falls 
in prices and 
to 
sales by euro area households.
 Holdings 
of listed shares issued by non
-euro area residents nearly doubled over 
the
 period, 
owing to 
both net 
purchases and price increases. This increase was particularly noticeable fo
r holdings of 
securities 
issued by US and Swiss residents, which together grew by more than 
•40 billion.
  Aggregate euro area household debt figures also conceal a marked 
heterogeneity across countries in term of levels and dynamics.
 Chart 7 shows

 3 Wealth effects on consumption
 Wealth may have an impact on private consumption via various channels
, which typically d
istinguish between financial and non
-financial or housing 
wealth effects.
 A typical
 starting point is a life
-cycle perspective in which consumer 
spending is determined by the lifetime resources available to consumers. Such 
resources are made up of human ca
pital, typically captured by labour income, real 
capital, such as housing assets, and financial wealth, consisting of cash, bonds and 
equity. H
ousehold spending 
thus 
depends on both 
current 
and expected future cash 
flows
. An i
ncreas
e in
 lifetime resources 
of consumers, including those related to 
wealth, should lead to 
higher
 consumption
. 
Household (expected) cash flows also 
relate to (i) property income, (ii) collateral available for consumers to pledge, and (iii) 
                                                                    82  See, for example,

 Household wealth and consumption in the euro area
  58 confidence.
83 Interest and dividend income that households receive out of their wealth 
may be used for spending. Studies of collateral effects largely relate to housing, with a 
key role for mortgage equity withdrawal. The latter plays a rather limited role in the 
euro 
area compared to United Kingdom and the United States. Confidence 
may play a 
role
, as consumers might feel more confident due to higher (valuation
s of) wealth and 
therefore save less and spend more. 
For example, a 
bullish stock market may make 
consumers fe
el more optimistic about the future of the economy and hence prompt 
them to 
increase their spending.
 The impact of wealth on private consumption differs substantially across its 
components and depends crucially on some key features.
 A key difference 
betwee
n housing and financial wealth is the role of housing services in consumption. 
Higher house prices also increase the relative price of consuming housing services. 
Other key features include household preferences concerning wealth components 
and debt, the e
ase with which wealth components can be turned into liquid assets and 
whether valuation changes are perceived as permanent or temporary. For example, 
households might be less inclined to sell their owner
-occupied houses in the presence 
of higher house pric
es than equities in the context of higher stock prices, partly due to 
higher transaction costs 
for 
houses than equities, but also 
due to their 
preferences
. 
This also depends on the institutional setting. In countries with more sophisticated 
mortgage produc
ts (
e.g. 
reverse mortgages
 or home equity loans)
, non-financial 
wealth 
can be made liquid 
more easily than some kinds of financial wealth
, such as
 insurance products
. The direction of wealth effects at the macro level is, however, not always clear
, because
 wealth components are typically not held equally by consumers.
 This 
applies in particular to housing wealth effects.
 As already mentioned at the start of 
Section 2, 
increases in house prices do not necessarily constitute an increase in 
wealth for the coun
try as a whole. Similarly, it could be argued that fundamental 
changes in house prices, like other asset prices, represent only a redistribution of 
wealth between owners of housing and non
-owners.
 Economy
-wide there is no pure 
housing wealth effect from a 
change in house prices arising from a change in the 
fundamental value. There can, however, be a wealth effect related to house prices in 
periods when households are overly optimistic or pessimistic and the change in house 
                                                                    83  For e

 Household wealth and consumption in the euro area
  59 prices reflects a change in the sp
eculative bubble component of house prices.
84 Higher house prices can, however, result in redistribution effects, if those long on 
housing (landlords) spend differently out of their wealth from those short on housing 
(tenants). In addition, higher house pri
ces improve the scope for mortgage equity 
withdrawal. The latter may boost consumption in the short run, but will depress it in the 
long run, as the increased debt will have to be serviced. Box 2 reports wealth effects 
as found in the literature for the eu
ro area and the largest euro area countries.
 Box 
2  Estimates of wealth effects for the euro area and the largest euro area countries
 Prepared by Gabe de Bondt and Arne Gieseck
 Wealth effects are often reported in terms of the marginal propensity to consum
e (MPC) out of wealth 
(measured in cent per euro of wealth). This
 is the proportion of an aggregate rise in wealth that gets 
spent on consumption. The MPC out of wealth might vary by wealth level
, and in micro studies the 
MPC is typically lower at higher w
ealth. At the macro level, which is the focus of this article, the 
empirical literature reports a wide range of MPC
s out of wealth. Table 
A provide
s an overview of 
empirical estimates for the euro area
 and the four largest euro area countries
. In the 
literature, long
-term housing wealth effects in the euro area are consistently found to be weaker 
than those of financial wealth, with the latter significantly positive. The estimated long
-term MPC out 
of housing wealth in the euro area, as reported in var
ious studies, ranges
 between 
1 and 
+2 cent 
per 
euro 
and is not a
lways significantly different from zero (
see the 
upper half of 
Table A). In contrast, the 
long
-term MPC out of financial wealth is always found to be significantly positive, 
ranging 
between 1
 and 7 cent
 per euro (
see the 
lower half of Table A)
. The median and average long
-term housing 
wealth effects are close to zero in the euro area, whereas the median and average reported MPC
s out 
of financial wealth are 1 to 4 cent 
per 
euro. Notwithstanding
 the low estimates of MPC out of wealth, 
contributions from wealth to consumption growth can be considerable in periods of large swings in 
asset prices.
 Aggregated euro area wealth effects mask striking heterogeneity among the four largest euro area 
countr
ies, with consistently positive estimated long
-term MPC out of housing wealth for Spain and out 
of financial wealth for France and Spain. There
 are wide 
range
s of empirical estimates 
of 
the 
long
-term MPC out of housing wealth
 and financial wealth for the f
our largest euro area countries. For 
the former
, it varies between 
7 and +8 cent 
per euro 
(see 
the 
upper half of Table 
A) and
, for the latter
, between 
3 and +15 cent 
per euro 
(see 
the lower half of 
Table 
A). Spain is the only large euro area 
country for 
which consistently positive housing wealth effects have been estimated. Similarly, for 
France and Spain
, only positive long
-term MPCs out of financial wealth have been reported. Focusing 
on the median outcomes
, given the wide range of estimates, the MPC ou
t of housing wealth has been 
comparatively strong in Spain
, at 
3 to 4 cent
 per euro,
 and 
relatively 
weak in Germany and Italy
, at 
1 cent
 per euro
. Long
-term financial wealth effects have 
similarly 
been found to be strong in Spain
, with 
an MPC of 4 cent
 per euro,
 and weak in Germany
, with an MPC of 
1 cent
 per euro
.                                                                     84  For further reading on the argument of an economy

 Household wealth and consumption in the euro area
  61 4 Conclusions
 Observing household wealth developments and understanding their impact on 
economic activity is important for the conduct of monetary policy
. The stock of
 household 
wealth
 is 
currently 
about seven times 
households™ 
annual disposable 
income 
in the euro area
. 
Movements in wealth are mainly driven by capital gains 
rather than net savings. 
Monetary policy 
may thus 
have a
n impact on wealth 
developments, notably via its impact on asset prices.
 Household wealth can both 
decline substantially (as in the aftermath of the 
global financial crisis
) and increase 
significantly (as in the run
-up to the 
global financial crisis
 and 
in 
recent years) and 
may 
thus 
at times 
contribute significantly to fluctuations 
in 
economic activity. It may 
also
 have an impact on the assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance.
 Empirical analysis 
and estimates reported in this article 
suggest wide ranges for 
non-financial and financial wealth effects
 and substantial differences across euro area 
countries. 
In addition, wealth effects and the relative importance of non
-financial 
wealth and financial wealth vary over time.
 The broad nature 
of, 
and interplay 
between, 
channels through which household 
wealth may affect private consumption call for multiple perspectives 
in 
the 
assessment of the implications for the macroeconomy and monetary policy.
 Besides lifetime
-related wealth effects, 
other 
channels relating to proper
ty income, 
collateral and 
confidence
 may play a role in relation to private consumption
. 
In 
addition, t
he direction of wealth effects at the macro level is not always clear
, because 
wealth components are typically not h
eld equally by consumers.
 Some househ
olds 
benefit from rising house prices, whereas other are affected negatively. Given the 
rather limited role played by home equity withdrawal in the euro area, it is not 
surprising that long
-term housing wealth effects in some euro area countries are 
estima
ted to be close to zero. More generally, 
wealth 
effects 
at the aggregated 
household sector
 level, which has been the focus of this article, might be different from 
those 
at the micro or household level.
 Finally, the creation of a capital markets union in 
the euro area would not only help firms to diversify their financing sources and improve 
their resilience to shocks emanating from the banking system but would also provide 
more investment opportunities for households and could facilitate the accumulation o
f 
wealth.

  62 2 Assessing bank lending to corporates in the euro area 
since 2014
 Prepared by Ramón Adalid, Matteo Falagiarda and Alberto Musso
85 1 Introduction
 Bank lending is the most important source of external financ
e for euro area 
firms and is therefore cr
ucial for the transmission of monetary policy and, more 
generally, supporting economic growth.
 Despite the increasing relevance of 
non-bank financing over the last decade
, b
ank lending remains 
a key element in 
the 
financing of euro area corporates. In particular, bank loans 
accounted for around 45% 
of total 
non-financial corporation (
NFC
) debt financing in 2018, down from around 60% 
in 2007.
86 During this period, credit markets were subject to multiple sources of
 stress, 
with the banking sector and its intermediation capacity being particularly affected. As a 
result, 
it 
has become even more essential from a central bank perspective
 to carry out 
careful analysis of bank lending.
 This article provides an assessment 
of the recovery in lending to NFC
s observed in the euro area since 2014.
87 It
 focuses on two main aspects of this 
assessment.
 First, the article shows that, following the period of adjustment of bank balance 
sheet
s in 2008
-13, improving bank credit supply c
onditions have supported the 
growth
 in 
corporates
™ business investment.
 More ample credit supply has thus 
complemented the 
stronger
 demand for credit, which in turn reflected improvements in 
the macroeconomic outlook, 
corporate
 balance sheets and 
corporate
 profitability. At 
the same time, the
 strength 
of the relationship between business investment and bank 
lending
 to 
corporates
 has 
differed 
across the major euro area countries, owing in part 
to the var
ying
 use of alternative sources of financing and differ
ent deleveraging needs.
 Second, the article provides evidence that the recovery in NFC lending 
has 
been
 supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures.
 This evidence includes 
quantitative model
-based estimates 
together with
 survey
-based information. This 
analysis is complemented by a forward
-looking assessment suggesting that the new 
series of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO
 III) will 
help to 
preserve 
favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary 
policy a
nd further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy.
                                                                     85  Data support provided by Filippo Claps and Franziska Fischer.

  63 2 The recovery in bank lending
 to corporates
 Bank lending to euro area 
corporates
 has gradually recovered since 2014, 
broadly in line with economic activity, although growth remains below 
pre
-crisis levels.
 Annual growth
 in loans to NFCs
, which had reached a trough in 
early 2014, returned to positive territory in 2015 and increased gradually thereafter, 
peaking at 4.3% in September 2018. It has stabilised at around 3.5
-4% in recent 
quarters
, reflecting the slowdown in real economic activity observed 
during
 2018.88 Overall, the recovery in bank lending to firms since 2014 has been rather moderate, 
with current growth rates 
remaining
 well below pre
-crisis levels, despite very 
favourable financing c
onditions in particular since the ECB adopt
ed non-standard 
monetary policy 
measures in 2014.
89 Evidence based on a Bayesian 
vector 
autoregression (
VAR
) model suggests that the pattern of the recovery since 2014 has 
been broadly in line with macroeconomic developments, given past business cycle 
regularities (Chart
 1), 
although
 it tends to be at the low
er end of the estimated 
confidence band. This assessme
nt is based on a comparison between actual loan 
growth and what should have been expected taking the observed main 
macroeconomic variables in the recovery period as given and assuming that the 
relationship between bank lending and economic activity has not
 fundamentally 
changed over the past twenty years.

to the first quarter of 
2014 including six real and financial variables 
at quarterly frequency for the euro area: real 
GDP, the GDP deflator, bank loans to NFCs, the short

ten
-year 
sovereign bond yield and the lending rate to NFCs. The grey area includes the 16th and 84th percentiles of the forecast condi

 Assessing bank lending to corporates in the euro area since 2014
  64 The overall 
moderate
 pace of the recovery in NFC bank lending since 2014 
mainly reflect
s the post
-crisis deleveraging process and the growing relevance 
of alternative sources of financ
e. While 
receiving strong support from 
the ECB™s 
non-standard monetary policy measures (see 
Section
 4 of this article
), bank lending to 
corporates
 since 2014 has been restrained by at least three factors, with a number of 
demand factors playing a role. First, loan growth dynamics during the recovery have 
reflected the somewhat weaker economic act
ivity compared with pre
-crisis levels 
(Chart
 1).
90 Second, the strong balance sheet adjustment process affecting borrowers 
in the post
-crisis period (Chart
 2) has weighed on the demand for bank loans in some 
countries
 more than others
. Bank borrowing has ma
inly been weaker in sectors whose 
indebtedness increased the most during the pre
-crisis boom, such as construction.
91 In a context of strong deleveraging needs, the ample availability of internal f
unding, as 
evidenced by
 the significant increase in retained
 earnings and liquid asset holdings 
recorded after the financial crisis, has also dampened the demand for bank loans in 
recent years.
92 Third, 
since
 the crisis firms have increasingly met their financing 
needs 
from
 alternative sources of external funding, 
mostly by
 issuing
 corporate bonds. 
Corporate bond issuance has become a more important source of 
funds
 for euro area 
firms (Chart
 3), particularly for large corporates: initially (2009
-10 and 2012
-14) as a 
substitute for bank borrowing, reflecting a signifi
cant decline in the relative cost of 
market
-based debt (Chart
 4) and restrictions in bank credit supply, and subsequently 
as a complementary source of finance to bank loans, in particular after the 
ECB 
launch
ed its c
orporate 
sector 
purchase 
programme (CSPP
) in 2016.
 A conclusive assessment of the factors behind the moderate pace of the 
recovery in bank lending to 
corporates
 requires a careful analysis of credit 
supply forces.
 For instance, given the endogeneity 
of both
 lending and economic 
activity, it woul
d be possible to conclude that the latter has been constrained by the 
lack of bank financing. By the same token, 
resorting
 to other sources of finance could 
be the result of concerns about the ability to access bank loans, and would be 
indicative of supply
-side constraints. The next section provides some evidence that 
helps to distinguish 
between
 these competing interpretations.
                                                                     90  The average annual growth rate of real GDP was 2.3% between 1999 and 2007 and 1.9% between 2014 
and 2019.

 3 Support
 for
 economic activity
 Credit supply conditions have supported 
corporates
™ business investment.
 A range of models show that credit supply conditions
 (i.e. the availability of bank credit
), which 
depressed
 business investment growth during the economic downturn, have 
been supporting business investment in the post
-2014 recovery phase. According to 
these analyses, 
credit
 supply conditions have boosted business investment growth by 
about 1
 percentage point on 
average over the recovery phase 
that 
start
ed in 2014 
(Chart
 5). Replies to surveys by both lenders and borrowers support this view. 
According to the ECB™s bank lending survey (BLS), which provides information on loan 
demand and the credit standards applied
 by banks, an unprecedentedly long period of 
easing credit conditions 
has been
 observed since the beginning of 2014.
93 The implementation of a number of non
-standard
 monetary policy 
measures 
turns out to 
be a
 significant factor supporting easing of supply, as 
discussed
 in Section
 4 of this 
article
. A similar view 
can be
 drawn from the 
Survey on the 
Access to 
Finance of 
Enterprises (SAFE), 
which
 covers a very large sample of euro area firms
. This 
shows 
that the
 availability of bank loans 
has 
improved considerably over the recovery 
phase.

). The l
atest observation
 is for the second quarter of
 2019. Longer
-term loans, typically linked to fixed capital and financial investment, 
have driven the recovery in bank 
lending
 to 
corporates
 since 2014.
 Loans 
with
 longer maturities have accounted for most of the lending growth to NFCs 
during
 the 
recovery, 
prov
ing more dynamic than short
-term loans (Chart
 6). This is in clear 
contrast 
to
 the pre
-crisis boom, when short
-term lending a
ccounted for more than 
a quarter
 of total bank lending to NFCs. The shift towards longer maturities has been 
favoured by both the flattening and the downward shift of the yield curve, driven to a 
significant extent by the ECB
™s monetary policy, which has s
upported the demand for 
long
-term fixed rate loans.
95 Long-term loans contribute to economic growth in two 
ways. First, they reduce firms™ rollover and cash flow stress. Second
, and more 
importantly, firms tend to have a preference for matching the maturity
 of their assets 
and liabilities, 
meaning that
 an abundance of long
-term financing makes it easier for 
them to engage in long
-term projects. In this respect, the solid growth 
in 
fixed 
investment 
seen
 in recent years is consistent with the increased relevan
ce of 
long
-term bank lending. Long
-term lending has also favoured financial activities of a 
structural nature, such as M&A, the 
magnitude
 of which has contributed to the recent 
dynamism observed in syndicated loans.
96                                                                     95  In particular, bank lending rates for short
-term loans (fixation period of up to one year) declined by around 
140 basis 
points
 between January 2014 and September 2019, while rates for long
-term loans (fixation 
period of over one year) declined by around 180 basis points
 over the same period.

 Bank loans to NFCs by maturity
 (annual percentage changes)
  Sources: ECB and ECB calculations.
 Notes: Breakdown by maturity based on 
unadjusted loans.
 The l
atest observation
 is for
 November
 2019. Survey evidence 
confirms t
he importance of business investment 
for
 the 
demand for bank loa
ns.
 According to the BLS, the demand for bank loans to euro 
area enterprises since 2014 has been 
supported 
by 
the
 funding
 that corporates 
need for fixed investment.
97 Beyond this
, M&A activity 
has 
also contributed to the growth in 
demand 
during the
 same 
period. The SAFE confirms that 
enterprises have mainly 
used the
 financ
e the
y have continued to obtain primarily from 
bank loans for fixed 
investment during the recovery.
98 The
 strength 
of the relationship between business investment and bank 
lending
 to 
corporates
 has, however, differe
d across countries.
 Business investment has 
been growing at similar rates across the large euro area countries since 2014 (see 
panel 
(a) in
 Chart
 7).
99 However, the growth 
in lending
 to NFCs has increasing
ly 
diverged
 in the l
arge euro area economies as the recovery at the euro area level 
has 
matured
, with Germany and France 
enjoying 
steadily increasing 
growth 
rates and Italy 
and Spain hovering around or below the zero line since 2016 (see panel 
(b) in
 Chart
 7). 
Bank lending 
to
 corporate
s has developed 
in line with business investment in 
Germany and France
100 whereas 
a sizeable gap 
can be observed 
in 
Spain
 in 
particular 
and also Italy
. 
In Germany and France, the recovery in bank lending to 
corporates has also been supported by dyn
amic real estate sectors and the need to 
finance M&A activities. In addition, in Germany, corporate indebtedness has remained 
particularly low, allowing firms to easily expand their recourse to external financing. In 
Italy and Spain, the gap between busine
ss investment and bank lending
 can be

Indeed, t
here is a link between the

 (Chart 8), and hence the availability of internal funding, and
 the deleveraging 
imperative, which has continued to weigh on 
the
 demand for loans in both countries, 
especially f

These sectors 
in particular have 
exercised
 a significant drag on total loan growth in Spain and Italy

101 In addition
, the issuance of debt securities by firms has 
grown in both Italy and Spain since 2017
, 
in clear contrast 
to
 previous recoveries
 (Chart

 Assessing bank lending to corporates in the euro area since 2014
  71 programme (APP) 
to 
target a variety of investment
-grade privat
e and public sector 
securities. These policies have also been underpinned by forward guidance on the key 
ECB interest rates and, more recently, the reinvestment horizon for the APP portfolio 
and the resumption of 
the 
APP. The ECB™s measures have stimulated
 the euro area 
economy via a number of transmission channels, leading to a significant upward 
impact on both real GDP and HICP inflation.
103 The transmission of these measures 
has operated 
in part 
through credit markets, including the direct pass
-through cha
nnel 
and the bank lending channel.
104 Overall, these monetary policies have supported 
both the demand 
for, 
and the supply of
, bank lending to corporates by improving the 
macroeconomic outlook and 
helping 
to mitigat
e banking sector constraints. This 
assessmen
t is supported by analyses based on macroeconomic models, 
survey
-based evidence and empirical studies based on micro data
. Model
-based estimates at the macro level suggest that non
-standard measures 
have significantly supported the recovery in bank lending
 to corporates.
 Simulations based on alternative macroeconomic models suggest that
, in the absence 
of the ECB™s monetary policy measures, NFC loan growth would have recovered 
more 
slowly
.105 More specifically, while the growth of bank lending to 
corporates
 rose from 
about 
-1% in early 2015 to about 4% by the end of 2018, these model
-based estimates 
suggest that, on average, annual loan growth would only have reached levels close to 
2% by 
the 
end of 
2018 if the ECB
 had not introduced it
s non
-standard monetary 
policy 
measures (Chart
 10). In other words, these measures are estimated to have induced 
about 2
 percentage points of NFC loan growth between early 2015 and end
-2018, 
affecting both demand and supply factors
.                                                                     103  For an overview of the macroeconomic impact of the monetary policy measures adopted by the ECB

The l
atest observation
 is for the fourth quarter of
 2018. Survey
-based evidence supports the view that the ECB™s measures 
have had a 
tangible impact 
on bank len
ding conditions.
 Qualitative evidence on the relevance 
of the ECB™s non
-standard measures can be obtained from indicators derived from the 
BLS. 
A number of ad
 hoc questions included in the survey 
since 2015 
have made it 
possible to compile 
a synthetic view
 of how banks perceive the effect of recent ECB 
non-standard measures
, such as the TLTROs, 
a negative DFR and the APP
, on their 
financial situation and lending decisions. The replies to these questions indicate that 
these measures 
have had a favourable imp
act on banks™ liquidity and market financing 
conditions. Moreover, the survey responses suggest that the ECB™s measures 
have 
had a substantial net easing impact on banks™ terms and conditions, while the effects 
on their credit standards 
have been
 more limi
ted.
106 Studies based on granular banking and firm
-level data suggest that the impact 
of the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures on credit markets 
has 
operated via various channels.
 With
 regard
 to
 the TLTROs, some evidence 
suggests that, in combinati
on with the other non
-standard measures introduced since 
June 2014, the first two series of operations have proven effective in supporting the 
transmission of lower policy rates into improved borrowing conditions for 
corporates
 in 
the euro area. Moreover, 
these operations appear to have supported higher 
intermediation volumes in less vulnerable euro area countries and a slowdown of the 
contraction in bank lending in vulnerable countries.
107 Concerning the third series of 
such 
operations, Box
 1 provides an overview of its modalities and the 
development
 of 
banks™ funding conditions in the 
wake
 of its announcement.

 Assessing bank lending to corporates in the euro area since 2014
  73 The introduction of a negative DFR 
in mid
-2014 has provided an additional incentive 
for banks to lend to 
NFCs
 by increasing the oppor
tunity cost of holding excess liquidity. 
As such, 
a negative DFR 
has 
provided an effective 
foil
 to the APP by increasing the 
cost of holding the reserves injected by the ECB™s large
-scale purchase programme
. 
This has given banks an 
incentive to rebalance t
owards other assets, notably loans, 
thereby boosting credit supply.
108 Although t
his impact was broad
-based
, it was not 
evenly spread
 across banks, and some evidence suggests that it was stronger for 
universal banks and for banks with higher holdings 
of 
sove
reign bond
. Box 1
 The new series of quarterly targeted longer
-term refinancing operations: impact on funding 
costs and transmission
 Prepared by Francesca Barbiero and Lorenzo Burlon
 The new series of quarterly targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (T
LTRO III) that started in 
September 2019 contains incentives for banks to maintain favourable lending conditions to the real 
economy.
 Similarly to TLTRO
 II, the new series features rewards, in the
 form of lower interest rates, 
for banks that extend eligibl
e loans to firms and households.
109 The maximum rate is fixed at the level 
of the 
main refinancing operations (
MRO
) rate. By contrast
, the rate applied to TLTRO
 III for 
counterparties whose eligible net lending between the end of March 2019 and the end of Ma
rch 2021 
exceeds their benchmark net lending will benefit from a reduction that can bring it to a level as low as 
the 
deposit facility rate (
DFR
) (currently 
-50 basis points).
110 Two main parameters define the 
incentive scheme: the width and position of the 
range of interest rates that are applied
, and the 
amount by which lending needs to exceed the benchmark to attain the lowest possible rate (Chart
 A). 
In terms of
 the rates, a higher maximum rate would have 
made it 
unattractive 
to 
participat
e in the 
operati
on, leading to low uptake and an unwarranted broader tightening of bank funding conditions. 
At the same time
, the minimum achievable rate had to be calibrated in such a way as to provide the 
desired
 accommodation and 
simultaneously
 avoid banks be
ing
 comple
tely discouraged from 
obtaining 
funding by issuing debt securities in private markets
. Turning to the lending performance 
requirement, the lending threshold provides the target 
required 
to induce sufficient eligible bank 
lending, while its rather moderate 
level avoids triggering predatory behaviour by intermediaries that 
could result in large loan exposures and excessive risk
-taking. These main parameters are flanked by 
additional features that also 
help
 to 
achieve 
the aim
s of TLTRO
 III. In particular, 
unwanted uses of the 
funds borrowed
 (i.e. acqui
ring
 assets 
rather than extending eligible loans
) are further 
res
trained by 
borrowing allowances that limit the scope for additional borrowing, given the amounts already 
                                                                    108  For a more detailed analysis, see

 109  Eligible loans in the context of TLTRO III (as in the previous TLTROs) are loans to non
-financial 
corporations and to 
households, excluding loans to households for house purchases.
 110  Benchmark net lending
 is the amount of eligible net lending 
(gross lending in the form of eligible loans net 
of repayments of outstanding amounts of eligible loans) 
that a participant needs 
to exceed in the period 
from 
1 April 2019 to 31
 March 2021 in order to qualify for an interest rate on the participant™s TLTRO
 III 
borrowing that is lower than the initial rate applied
. It is equal to zero for banks that exhibited positive 
eligible net len
ding in the 12
-month period to end
-March 2019 and equal to the eligible net lending over 
the same period for banks that exhibited negative eligible net lending. This distinction removes potential 
disincentives to ongoing deleveraging efforts by participant
s. The maximum rate reduction is achieved 
when the benchmark net lending exceeds the threshold of 2.5% above the sum of the 
outstanding 
amounts of eligible loans as at 31
 March 2019 and the benchmark net lending

 Note
s: The chart provides an illustration of the borrowing rate for TLTRO
 III. MRO and DFR refer to the average rates prevailing over the life of each operation. 
The grey area identifies the region in the 
parameter space that is compatible with the aim and limitations of the programme.
 The announcement of TLTRO III in March 2019 reassured markets about the extension of a 
longer
-term funding facility and alleviated the funding pressure on banks. The
 new oper
ations helped 
to stave off ﬁcongestion effectsﬂ that would materialise in bank funding markets
 owing to the 
concurrent need to re
place
 expiring TLTRO
 II funds and large 
volumes
 of maturing bonds (Chart
 B). 
Such congestion effects would have pushed up bank 
bond spreads, affecting funding costs not only 
for banks that had borrowed 
under TLTRO
 II but also for other banks. Indeed, according to the ECB
™s bank 
lending 
survey (BLS), banks 
have 
reported a net easing of market conditions since the new 
programme
 was 
announced
, especially for debt securities funding.
111 Although this change 
partly 
reflected the reversal of the 
widening
 in credit spreads following the risk
-aversion episode
 at the end 
of 2018
, it also occurred despite the 
worsening of
 the macroeconomic outlook and the increase in 
uncertainty throughout 2019, circumstances that could have otherwise prompted a deterioration in 
banks™ access to funding.

 II.1, TLTRO
 II.2, TLTRO
 II.3 and TLTRO
 II.4 mature in June 2020, September 2020, December 2020 and March 2021 respectively.
 In September 2019 the Governi
ng Council decided to adjust the pricing and the maturity of TLTRO III 
against the background of a more protracted slowdown in the euro area economy than previously 
anticipated.
112 The
 new modalities adopted in September 2019 will preserve favourable bank le
nding 
conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the 
accommodative stance of monetary policy.
113 The additional accommodation is expected to 
be transmit
ted
 via an overall compression of bank funding costs and a higher u
ptake of TLTRO
 III funds. 
Direct funding cost relief will be provided to banks that shift their funding choices away from more 
expensive bond funding options, while the overall decrease in the supply of securities induced by the 
lower funding needs of bank
s will exert further pressure on remaining market bond yields. As a 
consequence, the bank lending channel will lead to lower lending rates and higher credit volumes, as 
the experience of previous TLTROs shows.
114 Using a suite of models estimated on euro are
a data, 
the latest expectations 
of market participants for TLTRO
 III uptake as reported in surveys, which 
range between 
•300 billion 
and 
•560 billion, can be mapped to an overall funding cost relief of around 
15 basis points. This in turn would be expected
 to lead to a peak reduction in lending rates of 15
 basis 
points and a positive contribution to annual loan growth of almost 0.4
 percentage p
oints (Chart C).
                                                                     112  The pricing of TLTRO III was adjusted in September 2019 by removing 
the 10 basis points spread over 
the MRO and the DFR, while the maturity was extended from two years to three.

 5 Concluding remarks
 This article provides an assessment of the recovery in bank lending to euro 
area firms observed since 2014.
 Evidence reported in the article shows that loan 
growth 
has 
remained below pre
-crisis levels
 during 
the recovery
. While supported by 
highly
 favourable financing conditions, the 
moderate
 pace of the recovery has mainly 
reflected the post
-crisis deleveraging process and the growing relevance of alternative 
sources of financ
e, as well as somewhat weaker eco
nomic activity compared with the 
pre
-crisis period.
 Improving credit supply conditions have supported the growth of credit and 
hence
 the expansion in firms™ business investment.
 The positive effect of credit 
supply factors has reinforced the impact of a gr
adual normalisation in credit demand, 
which reflect
s improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and 
corporate
 balance 
sheets. The
 strength 
of the relationship between business investment and bank 
lending
 to 
corporates
 has, however, differe
d across countries
. This heterogeneity is 
explained in part by the var
ying
 relevance of the use of alternative sources of financ
e across countries, the differ
ing
 levels
 of deleveraging needs and country
-specific 
macroeconomic developments.
 Finally, ample evidence indicates 
that the recovery in bank lending to 
corporates
 would have been significantly weaker in the absence of the 
monetary policy measures 
pursued
 by the ECB 
since the summer of 2014.
 More 
specifically, model
-based estimates at the macro level, survey
-based evide
nce and 
studies based on granular banking and 
corporate
 data all suggest that

 Assessing bank lending to corporates in the euro area since 2014
  77 non-standard measures have accounted for a significant 
portion
 of the recovery in 
bank lending
 to 
corporate
s. A forward
-looking assessment suggests that TLTRO
 III will 
help to 
preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission 
of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy.
