  2 Update on economic and monetary 
developments
 Summary
 The euro area is facing an economic contraction of a magnitude 
and speed that are 
unprecedented in peacetime.
 Measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) have largely halted economic activity in all the countries of the euro area 
and across the globe. Survey indicators for consumer and business sentim
ent have 
plunged, suggesting a sharp contraction in economic growth and a profound 
deterioration in labour market conditions.
 Given the high uncertainty surrounding the 
ultimate extent of the economic fallout, growth scenarios produced by ECB staff 
suggest that euro area GDP could fall by between 5% and 12% this year, depending 
crucially on the duration of the containment measure
s and the success of policies to 
mitigate the economic consequences for businesses and workers. As the containment 
measures are gradually lifted, these scenarios foresee a recovery in economic activity, 
although its speed and scale remain highly uncertain.
 Inflation has declined as a result 
of the sharp fall in oil prices and slightly lower HICP inflation excluding energy and 
food.
 In its determination
 to continue to support 
the euro area economy
 in the face of the 
current economic disruption and heightened
 uncertainty, 
the Governing Council 
decided to further ease the conditions 
on the targeted longer
-term refinancing 
operations (TLTRO III) 
and to
 launch a new series of 
non
-targeted 
pandemic 
emergency longer
-term r
efinancing operations (PELTROs). In additio
n, purchases are 
conducted under the 
pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(PEPP), while net 
purchases are continuing under the asset purchase programme (APP) at 
a monthly 
pace of •20 billion
 together with the APP purchases under 
the additional •120 billio
n temporary envelope 
available 
until the end of the year.
 Together with the substantial 
monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures 
will support liquidity and 
funding conditions and help to preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real 
economy.
 At the same time, 
the Governing Council will 
need to continu
ally
 evaluate 
the m
easures, individually and as a package, to assess whether the
y are still 
adequately calibrated and 
of an 
appropriate size to provide the necessary degree of 
accommodati
on in 
the pursuit of its price stability mandate.
 The coronavirus outbreak and the associated containment measures have paralysed 
the global economy and trade.
 The
 latest s
urvey data
 point to a sharp contraction in 
global activity 
in the first half of 2020
. China recorded its lowest growth level in 
decades in the first quarter
 of 2020
, while the impact of the pandemic on other key 
economies is expected to be 
particularly
 visible in the second quarter. World trade is 
also estimated to have fallen sharply, dr
iven by supply chain disruptions and a 
widespread demand shock. 
At the same time, t
he expected rapid deterioration in 
global activity and trade has been met with forceful policy measures globally.

 Summary
  3 inflationary pressures 
are expected to 
decrease
 furt
her as a result of both the sharp 
fall in oil prices and weak demand.
 Since the Governing Council meeting in
 early March 
2020, long
-term 
sovereign yields 
have 
increas
ed amid some volatility 
and the price of risky assets 
has 
decreas
ed. The 
spread of the coronavirus and the lockdown of numerous economies 
have
 placed 
enormous
 strain on euro area financial markets
. However, a
 number of policy actions 
have
 helped to calm markets, 
leading to a reversal of the negativ
e trend in most asset 
price
s. The EONIA forward 
curve
 shifted slightly upwards, as markets were no
 longer
 expecting an imminent reduction in the deposit facility rate. In foreign exchange 
markets, the euro weakened slightly in trade
-weighted terms
. The latest economic indicators and
 survey results covering the period since the 
coronavirus spread to the euro area
 have shown an unprecedented decline, pointing 
to a significant contraction in euro area economic activity and to rapidly deteriorating 
labour markets. The coronavirus pandemi
c and the associated containment measures 
have severely affected the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the 
productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand.
 In the first 
quarter of 2020, which was only partially affect
ed by the spread of the coronavirus, 
euro area real GDP decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter, reflecting the impact of the 
lockdown measures in the final weeks of the quarter. The sharp downturn in economic 
activity in April suggests that the impact is li
kely to be even more severe in the second 
quarter. 
Given the highly uncertain duration of the pandemic, the likely extent and 
duration of the imminent recession and the subsequent recovery are difficult to 
predict.
1 Euro area growth is expected to resume a
s the containment measures are 
gradually lifted, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal 
stance and a resumption in global activity.
 However, t
he extent of the contraction and 
the recovery will depend crucially on the duration an
d the success of the containment 
measures, how far supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected, 
and the success of policies in mitigating the adverse impact on incomes and 
employment.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annua
l HICP inflation decreased 
from 0.7% in March to 0.4% in April, largely driven by lower energy price inflation, but 
also slightly lower HICP inflation excluding energy and food. On the basis of the sharp 
decline in current and futures prices for oil, headl
ine inflation is likely to decline 
considerably further over the coming months. The sharp downturn in economic activity 
is expected to lead to negative effects on underlying inflation over the coming months. 
However, the medium
-term implications of the cor
onavirus pandemic for inflation are 
surrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker 
demand may be partially offset by upward pressures related to supply disruptions. 
Market
-based indicators of longer
-term inflation expectatio
ns have remained at 
depressed levels. Even though survey
-based indicators of inflation expectations have 
declined over the short and medium term, longer
-term expectations have been less 
affected.

 Summary
  4 Regarding monetary developments, 
broad money (M3) growth 
inc
reased to 7.5% in 
March 2020, from 5.5% in February. 
M3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit 
creation for the private sector, and the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the 
main contributor to broad money growth. 
Developments in loans to the pri
vate sector 
have also been shaped by the impact of the coronavirus.
 The annual growth rate of 
loans to households stood at 3.4% in March 2020, after 3.7% in February, while the 
annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations stood at 5.4% in Marc
h, after 
3.0% in February.
 The results of the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter 
of 2020 
also 
indicate a surge in firms™ demand for loans and for drawing on credit lines 
to meet liquidity needs for working capital, while financing needs fo
r fixed investment
 have
 declined.
 Credit standards for loans to firms tightened slightly, while credit 
standards for loans to households tightened more 
strongly. 
At the same time, banks 
expect an easing of credit standards for loans to firms in the second 
quarter of 2020.
 The Governing Council™s 
policy measures, in particular the more favourable terms for 
TLTRO III operations and the collateral easing measures, should encourage banks to 
extend loans to all private sector entities.
 Combining
 the outcome of t
he economic analysis with the signals coming from the 
monetary analysis
, the Governing Council
 confirmed that an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to 
levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the
 medium term.
 On the basis of this assessment
, the Governing Council
 decided to further ease the 
conditions on 
the ECB™s 
TLTRO III
 operations 
.This will 
support further the provision of 
credit to households and firms in the face of the current economic dis
ruption and 
heightened uncertainty
, buffering the coronavirus shock on credit conditions
. Specifically, 
the Governing Council
 decided to reduce the interest rate on TLTRO III 
operations during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 to 50 basis points below
 the 
average interest rate on the Eurosystem™s main refinancing operations prevailing over 
the same period. Moreover, for counterparties whose eligible net lending reaches the 
lending performance threshold
 of 0%
, the interest rate over the period from June
 2020 
to June 2021 will now be 50 basis points below the average deposit facility rate 
prevailing over the same period.
2 The Governing Council 
also decided on a new series of non
-targeted pandemic 
emergency longer
-term refinancing operations
 (PELTROs
) to s
upport liquidity 
conditions in the euro area financial system and contribute to preserving the smooth 
functioning of money markets by providing an effective liquidity backstop. The 
PELTROs consist of seven additional refinancing operations
 commencing in Ma
y 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021 in line 
with the duration of 
the Governing Council™s 
collateral easing measures. They will be 
carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate
 that 
is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations prevaili
ng 
over the life of each PELTRO

 Summary
  5 Since the end of March 
the Governing Council 
has
 been conducting purchases under 
the ECB™s
 new pandemic emergency purchase programm
e (PEPP), which has an 
overall envelope of •750 billion, to ease the overall monetary policy stance and to 
counter the severe risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the 
outlook for the euro area posed by the coronavirus pandemic. These pur
chases will 
continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and 
among jurisdictions. 
Net asset purchases 
will be conducted 
under the PEPP until 
the 
Governing Council
 judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over, but in any
 case 
until the end of this year.
 Moreover, net purchases under 
the ECB™s
 APP will continue at a monthly pace of •20 
billion, together with the purchases under the additional •120 billion temporary 
envelope until the end of the year. 
The Governing Council 
continue
s to expect monthly 
net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the 
accommodative impact of 
the 
policy rates
 in the euro area
, and to end shortly before 
it start
s raising the key ECB interest rates.
 The Governing 
Council
 also intend
s to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal 
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period 
of time past the date when 
it start
s raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case 
for as long as ne
cessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample 
degree of monetary accommodation.
 In addition, 
the Governing Council
 decided to keep the key ECB interest rates 
unchanged
 and 
expect
s them to remain at their present or lower levels until 
it 
has seen 
the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% 
within 
its 
projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in 
underlying inflation dynamics.
 Overall, t
he decisive and targeted policy
 measures that 
the Governing Council
 has taken since early March have provided crucial support to the euro area economy and 
especially to the sectors most exposed to the crisis. In particular, 
the 
measures are 
supporting liquidity conditions and helping to
 sustain the flow of credit to households 
and firms, especially small and medium
-sized enterprises, and to maintain favourable 
financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions.
 At the same time, 
in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, t
he Governing 
Council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to 
support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. This 
applies first and foremost to the role of the Governing Council in ensuring
 that the 
ECB™s monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions 
in the pursuit of its price stability mandate. The Governing Council is, therefore, fully 
prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its compositi
on, by as much as 
necessary and for as long as needed. In any case, the Governing Council stands 
ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves 
towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to sy
mmetry.

  6 1 External environment
 The coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) outbreak has paralysed the global 
economy and 
trade
. The m
easures
 taken by governments
 to contain the spread of the virus are a 
key factor 
driving
 the sharp decline in
 economic activity in the near term. 
Other factors 
also 
weigh
ing
 on economic activity, especially in 
emerging market economies, include 
a sharp
 reduction in
 commodity prices, significant tightening of financial conditions 
and substantial capital outflows
. Survey data suggest that 
the 
economic fallout from containment measures is 
likely to be 
abrupt and 
deep.
 The global 
composite output Purchasing Managers™ 
Index (
PMI
) excluding the euro area 
declined sharply
 from 52 in January to 45 in 
February and further 
to 41 in
 March
. The decline
 was driven by the strong contraction 
in the services index, which plummeted to 39.4, the lowest level since December 2008
 (see Chart 1)
. This 
points to a sharp contraction 
in global activity (excl
uding the euro 
area
) in the firs
t half of 2020, which 
is likely 
to 
be more
 pronounced than 
at 
the trough 
observed during th
e global financial crisis (GFC).

 Note: The latest observations are for 
March 2020.
 The expected rapid deterioration in activity has been met with forceful policy 
measures
. Central banks 
that had
 room to decrease interest rates
 used it promptly 
and cut their key policy rates
, while 
some
 have also resumed asset purchases. 
Liquidity
-providing operations and swaps have been implemented to smooth the 
functioning of financial markets. In addition, large fiscal stimulus packages 
have been
 enacted
, with
 the composition of 
such
 packages 
being
 heavi
ly skewed towards loan 
guarantees and income support measures
. World trade is estimated to have fallen sharply
, driven by 
supply chain 
disruptions and a 
widespread
 demand shock
. In the first quarter of 2020 
virus
-related production disruptions in China aff
ected international trade, especially 
in Asian countries strongly interconnected with China through regional value chains.

  7 However, as the outbreak turned into a pandemic, production disruptions spread and 
are likely to weigh on global trade for some time
. Global merchandise imports 
contracted marginally further in February, extending the decline seen at the end of 
2019. At the same time, the 
global PMI for new export orders
 excluding the euro area 
remained unchanged in March at a very low level, pointing o
verall to a sharp fall in 
global trade in the first quarter of 2020 (see Chart 2).

 Note: The latest observations are for 
February 2020
 for global merchandise imports and

 for

 Global 
inflation slowed slightly 
in February
. Annual consumer price inflation in the 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD) 
declined to 2.2
% in 
February,
 driven by a moderation in energy price inflation, while 
food price inflation increased slightly. Meanwhile,
 inflation excluding food and energy 
remained stable at 2.2
% in February.
 The slowdown in inflation was broad
-based 
across most advanced economies a
nd major non
-OECD emerging market 
economies
. Looking ahead, global inflationary pressures are expected to 
decelerate 
further 
as a result of both
 the sharp fall in oil prices
 and weak demand
. Brent 
crude oil prices have 
declined
 by approximately 
43% since the March 
meeting of the 
Governing Council, primarily 
owing 
to a sudden collapse in 
demand associated with th
e COVID
-19 pandemic
. On 12 April 2020 t
he OPEC+ 
group announced plans to restrict oil supplies
, but these are unlikely to fully offset the 
loss of demand in the near term. While supply shocks contributed to market volatility, 
reduced demand and rising risk
 aversion were the key factors driving the fall in Brent 
crude oil prices to around 
USD 
20 per barrel. Lack of adequate storage capacity has 
put further downward pressure on oil prices. Notably, North American producers were 
temporarily forced to dispose o
f oil at negative prices to avoid shutting down oil wells, 
as doing so would
 have
 permanently damage
d their production capacity. The 
International Energy Agency expect
s full
-year global oil demand to decline for the first 
time in over a decade, forecasting
 a fall of 
-9.3% in 2020. Total non

  8 prices 
have 
declined markedly (
-8.5%) since the March Governing Council meeting as 
both metal prices (
-9.2%) and food prices (
-5.7%) decreased
. Containment measures will lead to a decline in US economic 
activity in the first 
half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter.
 Advance estimates for the first 
quarter suggest that GDP contracted at an annualised rate of 4.8%. 
This constitutes 
the largest decline in GDP since the global financial crisis, when G
DP fell by 8.4% in 
the final quarter of 2008
. As t
his advance estimate
 is 
based on incomplete data and 
subject to further revisions
, forthcoming releases could show an even larger decline in 
GDP
. The impact on economic activity is expected to be even large
r in the second 
quarter. 
By 
end
-March
, almost all 
US 
states had ordered wide
-ranging business 
closures and strict limits on movement
. The cumulative number of workers seeking 
unemployment insurance 
from mid
-March to end
-April reached 
around 30 million, i.e
. 19% of the labour force. 
As a result, consumer confidence and spending has plunged. 
In early April
 the University of Michigan 
Consumer 
Sentiment 
Index 
fell
 to its
 lowest 
level since December 2011, while r
etail sales 
fell steeply by
 a record 8.7% in March
. Sharp drops in other indicators, such as PMIs, 
point to
 a more generalised impact on 
activity
. Overall, US GDP 
is expect
ed to shrink in the 
first half of the year
 by more than 
during the 
GFC. The policy response has been immediate. On the fiscal side, 
US Congress agreed on fiscal support 
amounting to almost 10% of GDP, consisting of
 government spending to contain the outbreak and me
asures to attenuate its effects. 
On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve
 System 
cut the target rang
e for the federal 
funds 
rate
 to between 0
% and ¼
%. It also established a number of credit facilities that 
can provide up to USD 2.3 trillion in financing against a wide range of collateral, 
activated swap lines with other central banks, expanded its repo operations and 
relaxed pr
udential policies to ensure 
that 
financial markets remain liquid and credit 
continues to flow through the economy
. In Japan, 
the pandemic 
has had a 
severe impact
 on activity, despite 
the
 strong 
policy response
. The pandemic struck when the economy was 
starting to show signs 
of a modest rebound
 following the sharp contraction in the final quarter of 2019 related 
to the October VAT hike and typhoons
. The Composite PMI fell to its lowest level since 
the March 2011 Great Eas
t Japan earthquake and tsunami, a
nd t
he Reuters Tankan 
signalled a further deterioration in business co
nditions in April. 
Prior to declaring a 
state of emergency, the government announced a sizeable economic package in 
response to the coronavirus crisis. Although the overall size of the a
nnounced 
package appears unprecedented (JPY 108 trillion, about 20% of GDP), a large part is 
related to private sector outlays
. In addition, i
t includes the December 2019 fiscal 
stimulus and the two 2020 emergency fiscal packages. This follows steps taken 
by the 
Bank of Japan, including the provision of ample supply of liquidity via JGB purchases 
and US
 dollar
-providing operations, an increase in purchases of commercial paper 
and bonds and the introduction of a special funds
-supplying operation to facilitat
e corporate financing
. Incoming data for the U

 suggest 
that the coronavirus outbreak 
has had 
a significant adverse impact on 
an already slowing

. Since then, the March PMI Composite Output Index 
has 
plummeted to a 
new series low, far below even the worst read
ings seen at the depths of the GFC.
 Economic policy responses have
 been swift and strong. 
On 11 March the
 Bank of 
England cut interest rates
 to 0.25% (subsequently reduced further to 0.1%), 
introduced a
 new Term Funding Scheme
 and reduced the count
ercyclical capital 
buffer. This
 support has been 
further 
extended to inclu
de a round of 
quantitative 
easing
 and the reactivation of a temporary monetary financing facility for the 
government
. At the same time, the government 
introduced a series of coronavirus 
contingency measures, including a variety of income support measures, 
additional 
budget for the 
National H
ealth 
Service, as well as an expansive array of loan facilities, 
tax payment holidays 
and grants to small businesses.
 Economic growth in China has fallen to its lowest level in decades as a result of 
the pandemic and weak external 
demand
. In the first quarter of 2020 
GDP 
decreased by 6.8% y
ear 
on year owing
 to virus containment measures. However, 
high
-frequency indicators of 
economic activity
 suggest that activity is recovering. 
While 
daily coal consumpti
on 
in early
-April 
continued at levels that were around 15 
percentage points lower than during the same period last year, 
real estate activity and 
traffic 
congestion 
indices 
are 
only marginally below 
the levels observed during 
the 
same period in 2019. Acti
vity is expected to 
rebound 
only partly 
in the second quarter 
of 2020 as weak domestic demand
 is amplified by weak external demand, held back 
by cautious consumer behaviour and 
the 
prevailing containment measures
. Policy 
measures 
have been
 implemented to su
pport the economy and ensure liquidity in the 
banking system. The People™s Bank of China has repeatedly injected significant 
liquidity in
 the 
market since the beginning of the year and 
has 
cut policy and reserve 
requirement rates
. Fiscal policy stimulus
 in the form of
 tax exemptions, purchase 
vouchers, income support and loan guarantees
 is expected to cushion the

 In foreign exchange markets, the euro 
weakened slightly in

 over the review period (see Chart 4), reflecting an appreciation against 
the currencies of several emerging market economies which was largely offset 
by a
 depreciation against the US dollar.

eciated (by 3.5%) against the US dollar and pound 
sterling (by 1.4%) following a phase of increased volatility. The euro also depreciated 
against the Chinese renminbi (by 2.7%), reversing an earlier appreciation and 
reflecting the different timing of the m

particular the impact of the coronavirus (

associated containment 
measures
. Total economic activity declined

fourth 
quarter 
of 2019 
(see Chart

Although a breakdown is not yet available, short
-term 
indicators suggest that the drop in GDP in the first quarter of 2020 was driven by 
domestic demand
, while c
hanges in inventories
 and net trade may have provided 
sma
ll positive contributions to growth. E
conomic indicators
, particularly surveys,
 have 
recently shown unprecedented falls, 
point
ing
 to 
a sharp decline in output in the period 
ahead. It is likely that the peak impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic will materialise 
in 
the second quarter of 2020.

  14 Employment data for the first quarter of 2020 are not yet available. 
The unemployment 
rate declined to 7.3%
 in Fe
bruary
, a similar rate to that observed before the financial 
crisis. 
However, it increased to 7.4% in March, the first month affected by the spread 
of 
COVID
-19 and the subsequent 
implementation of 
containment measures across the 
euro area
 (see Chart 6)
. The muted reaction of unemployment may be related to 
measures to ease access to short
-time work schemes. Preliminary estimates show an 
unprecedented number of employees in these schemes across the five largest euro 
area countries.

 The deterioration in consumption indicators is unprecedent
ed.
 Consumer 
confidence 
fell strongly following the COVID
-19 outbreak, dropping 
to 
-22.7
 in 
April
 (from 
-6.6 in February)
, close to the historical lows recorded in March 2009. However, 
there are indications that the fall in consumer confidence
 may in fact
 underestimate 
the 
underlying 
decline in consumption. The speed and severity of the COVID
-19 shock 
have been so exceptional that 
the
 historical relationship 
between consumer 
confidence and
 consumption growth 
currently
 seems quite unstable
.6 In March
 2020 euro area
 passenger car 
registrations 
recorded a 
steep
 drop (
-56.4
%) as a result of 
the COVID
-19 outbreak. With lockdown measures 
in place
 in most markets from 
around the middle of 
March
, the vast majority of 
euro area
 car 
dealerships were closed 
during the 
second half of 
that month. 
Similarly, other high
-frequency indicators 
suggest an unprecedented drop
, by
 up to 45%
, in household 
expenditure (e.g. 
restaurants, transport services, recreation, tourism
 and
 retail sales).
 The medium
-term impact of COVID
-19 on 
private consumption is very 
uncertain.
 There is a direct effect 
of the COVID

through the

the impact on income, wealth and access to credit. 
Furthermo
re, pent
-up demand may 
have a positive impact once containment measures are lifted. T
he 
medium
-term 
impact on private consumption 
depends on the duration
 of the lockdowns
, the pace at 
which measures are relaxed, changes in household behaviour
 and the effec
tiveness 
of public policies.
 Business investment is expected to fall substantially 
as a result of the 
lockdowns 
and further containment measures 
across euro area countries 
since
 March 2020
. Following non
-construction investment growth of 8.0%
, quarter 
on quarter,
 in 
the fourth quarter of 
2019 (0.2% excluding Irish data), investment dynamics
 decelerated
 in 
the first quarter of 
2020 and the outlook for 
the second quarter 
is 
poor. The dramatic fall in manufacturing production and sales, driven by a combination
 of 
supply and demand factors related to the COVID
-19 pandemic, 
is expected to
 have
 had
 a major adverse impact on business investment from March 2020 onwards. 
European Commission
 survey data up to 
April 
show 
strong 
declines in order books 
and production ex
pectations in the capital goods sector. High
-frequency data also 
point to a substantial deterioration in firms™ profit 
expectations
 and financi
ng conditions
 as well as 
a sharp
 increas
e in
 uncertainty, which would adversely affect 
future 
investment decision
s. While 
the 
euro area 
sectoral 
accounts show
ed continued 
growth in gross operating surplus in the fourth quarter of 2019, market data of 
one
-year
-ahead 
expected earnings per share 
among European 
listed firms dropped 
significantly
 in April
 2020. Investment
-grade corporate 
bond yields 
also 
rose
 steeply, 
particularly in the oil and automotive sectors. Uncertainty in terms of stock market 
volatility indices ha
s spiked in Europe
, with
 the 
European c
omposite 
indicator of 
systemic 
stress reach
ing
 unprec
edented levels
 in April 2020
. There are also 
substantial d
ownside risks 
to firms™ investment plans from 
rising debt levels, potential 
insolvencies
 and
 corporate 
default
s on long
-term debt commitments
, as well as 
declining 
cash flow
s. The
 extent
 to which
 national, euro area and EU
-wide policy 
measures to provide liquidity and credit can alleviate the situation
 remains to be seen
. Euro area forecasts for investment have been revised down 
significantly
, with 
the 
European Commission™s biannual industrial invest
ment survey
 published in
 April 2020 
show
ing an expected contraction of 4% in 2020
. Housing investment is expected to have fallen dramatically since March 2020 as 
a result of the containment measures and increased uncertainty
. Although 
housing investment 
increased slightly
 in the fourth quarter of 2019 (by 0.3
%, quarter 
on quarter
), some short
-term indicators reflecting the impact of the pandemic have 
already started to signal 
a substantial
 decline in construction activity. 
In particular
, the 
euro area 
PMI
 for business expectations in 
construction plunged to
 33.5 in March 
2020, its lowest level on record
, from 52.5 in February
, pointing to a
n unprecedented
 decline in activity. 
The suspension of plans and the shutdown of construction sites 
Œ especially
 in countries 
where
 lockdown measures
 were implemented at an early 
stage
, such as Germany, Italy and Spain 
Œ have
 already caused severe financial 
problems for construction companies
, according to the European Commission™s 
survey on limits to production
. Ove
r the medium term, 
while construction activity may 
benefit from lockdown measures being lifted earlier than in other sectors, it is likely 
that 
the pandemic will result in a 
significant
 decline in housing demand 
owing

  16 income and wealth
 losses
. Moreover,
 the uncertainty caused by the pandemic might 
have even larger 
and longer
-lasting 
effects on activity, as it could 
encourage
 households and investors to postpone property 
transactions 
until an effective medical 
solution
 for COVID
-19 is found.
 Euro area tra
de is likely to 
have 
contract
ed in the first quarter of 2020 
and to 
weaken further in the second quarter, as C
OVID
-19 has 
paralysed economies 
globally.
 The early signs of a recovery 
in euro area trade at the 
beginning
 of 2020 
were 
reversed
 by the effects o
f the p
andemic. In particular
, extra
-euro area imports 
have been
 contracting since February, signalling that supply interruptions due to
 the
 lockdown in China had 
reduced
 the country™s 
exports to the euro area. 
There was a
n unprecedented deterioration in n
ew export orders, a leading indicator, to 1
8.9
 in April
, from 49.5 in January
. Containment measures in several euro area countries resulted in 
a combination
 of adverse demand and supply shocks, 
leading to
 the largest drop 
on 
record in euro area foreign trade. 
There are a number of reasons why euro area trade 
is severely affected by the negative shocks of the pandemic
. First, i
nvestments and 
durable goods consumption, 
which
 are highly sensitive to 
both 
uncertainty and cyclical 
swings, are core
 components
 of foreign trade. 
Second, 
disruptions to 
global supply 
chain
s, in particular the reduction in imports of intermediate goods, 
also 
affect the euro 
area during this pandemic
. Finally,
 the spillover and spillback via regional produ
ction 
networks magnif
y domestic shocks in euro area economies, 
resulting in
 an even 
sharper
 contraction 
in intra
-euro area flows than
 in total trade flows.
 Countries 
specialised in services or in manufacturing related to services are expected to face
 parti
cularly
 severe 
economic consequences. Tourism and transport services are the 
worst affected
 by lockdown measures
, as 
seen in
 the collapse in
 new 
services 
export 
ord
ers and in flight schedules.
 Incoming economic data, particularly survey results, show un
pre
cedented 
falls, 
pointing to contractin
g output in the euro area
. The COVID
-19 outbreak and the 
associated containment measures
 have had an adverse impact on activity in 
manufacturing and services via increasing supply constraints and rapidly falling 
demand
. As regards 
recent
 survey data, 
the 
European Commission™s 
Economic 
Sentiment Indicator
 and 
the composite output PMI 
both 
posted the largest decline on 
record in
 March
7, before falling further in April. Both the ESI and the PMI displayed 
broad
-based 
declines across both countries and economic sectors. This decline in 
economic activity is also confirmed by high
-frequency indicators such as electricity 
consumption (see Chart 7).

The l

unprocessed food; HICP excluding energy and food; HICP excluding energy, food, travel
-related items and clothing; the 10% trimmed 
mean of the HICP; the 30% trimmed me
an of the HICP; and the weighted median of the HICP. Growth rates for HICP excluding energy 
and food for 2015 are distorted upwards owing to a methodological change (see the box entitled ﬁ

  21 5 Money and credit
 Broad money growth accelerated in March.
 With an increase of 7.5% in March 
2020, after 5.5% 
in February, the annual growth rate of M3 recorded its largest 
month
-on-month increase since the start of monetary union in 1999 (see Chart 11). 
While the slowdown in economic growth dampened M3, growth in M3 was strongly 
supported by emergency liquidity n
eeds, uncertainties related to the pandemic crisis, 
and the very low opportunity cost of holding monetary instruments. The narrow 
aggregate M1, which includes the most liquid components of M3, was the main 
contributor to broad money growth. The annual grow
th rate of M1 increased by more 
than 2 percentage points to 10.3% in March 2020, after 8.1% in February. In addition 
to a strong increase in overnight deposits, the annual growth rate of currency in 
circulation increased substantially, to 7.0% in March, af
ter 5.4% in February, pointing 
to precautionary motives in firms™ and households™ demand for liquidity. Firms 
increased their deposit holdings, which rose at an annual growth rate of 9.6% in 
March, up from 6.5% in February. This reflects substantial borrow
ing from banks, the 
overall ample issuance of corporate bonds, and direct liquidity support from 
governments. Despite a considerable reduction in the holdings of money market fund 
shares in March, marketable instruments made a significant, positive contrib
ution to 
annual M3 growth.

 In March 2020 credit to the private sector remained the main source of money 
growth, followed by external monetary flows.
 Credit to the private sector, which 
has long been the main driver of M3
 growth (see the blue portion of the bars in Chart 
11), was behind the strong increase in M3 growth in March 2020. External monetary 
flows have been the second main source of money creation since October 2018 (see

  22 investors in euro area assets (in particular newly issued government securities), and 
have provided a significant contribution to M3 since the beginning of 2019. The ECB™s 
net asset purchases under the pande
mic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), 
which was launched on 18 March 2020, together with the increased purchases under 
its asset purchase programme (APP), made a positive contribution to M3 growth (see 
the red portion of the bars in Chart 11). Furthermo
re, the contribution of longer
-term 
financial liabilities remained small in March 2020 (see the dark green portion of the 
bars in Chart 11).
 Loans to the private sector also increased significantly.
 The annual growth rate of 
monetary financial institution 
(MFI) loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, 
securitisation and notional cash pooling) increased to 5.0% in March 2020, after 3.7% 
in February (see Chart 12). This development was due to an increase in the annual 
growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) from 3.0% in February 2020 
to 5.4% in March. The increase in bank lending to firms was widespread across 
countries. For the second half of 2020, the leading indicators of the 
euro area bank 
lending survey
 point to a further increase in the demand for loans to firms. By 
comparison, the annual growth rate for loans to households decreased somewhat 
from 3.7% in February 2020 to 3.4% i
n March. The diverging developments between 
firms and households in March reflect a number of factors that affected demand from 
the two sectors, as evidenced by the results of the bank lending survey. In addition, the 
fact that government policies supporte
d the corporate sector with extraordinary, 
though temporary, credit support could also explain the diverging patterns. The ECB™s 
policy measures, in particular the more favourable terms for targeted longer
-term 
refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and the co
llateral easing measures, should 
encourage banks to extend loans to all private sector entities.

  23 needs related to the coronavirus (COVID
-19) crisis.
12 Overall, these 
developments reflect the deterioration in the economic outlook and the risks 
surrounding the COVID
-19 crisis. Given that the financing needs are 
emergency
-related, firms™ loan demand was significantly higher for short
-term loans 
than for long
-term loans. The main factors underlying firms™ loan demand in the first 
quarter of 2020 were financing needs for inventories and working capital, whereas 
loan demand for fixed investment and for mergers and acquisitions declined in net 
terms.
 Moreover, the deterioration in households™ creditworthiness and a lower risk 
tolerance on the part of banks provide an explanation for the relatively stronger 
tightening of credit standards for loans to households and the lower net increase in 
demand for 
housing loans and consumer credit compared with demand for loans to 
enterprises. In addition, the decrease in consumer confidence was a key factor 
dampening the demand for loans for house purchase and consumer loans. For the 
second quarter of 2020, banks e
xpect credit standards for firms to ease again on 
account of the liquidity support measures and loan guarantees introduced by 
governments. Although the heterogeneity of banks™ replies is currently high, the results 
suggest that firms™ loan demand will incr
ease further, as is evident from the highest net 
balance since the start of the survey in 2003. For households, however, a continuation 
of the net tightening of credit standards and a further decrease in household loan 
demand were foreseen by banks. In add
ition, euro area banks reported that the ECB™s 
asset purchase programmes (APP and PEPP) and the third series of targeted 
longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) had a positive impact on their liquidity 
position and market financing conditions. Toget
her with the negative deposit facility 
rate (DFR), these measures had an easing impact on bank lending conditions and a 
positive impact on lending volumes. At the same time, banks suggest that the ECB™s 
asset purchases and the negative DFR had a negative i
mpact on their net interest 
income, while the ECB™s two
-tier system supported bank profitability.
 Very favourable lending rates continued to support euro area economic growth.
 Lending rates touched historical lows again, having declined in line with market
 reference rates over previous months. In February 2020 the composite bank lending 
rates for loans to NFCs and households declined to 1.52% and 1.41% respectively 
(see Chart 13). Competitive pressures, favourable bank funding costs, the APP, and 
the pass
-through of the ECB™s deposit facility rate cut in September 2019 had a further 
dampening effect on lending rates for loans to NFCs and households. Overall, 
between May 2014 and February 2020, composite bank lending rates for loans to 
NFCs and households fel
l by around 140 and 150 basis points respectively.
                                         
                           
 12  In the first quarter of 2020, the net percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards (i.e. 
banks™ internal guide
lines or loan approval criteria) for loans or credit lines to firms was 4%, whereas the 
net tightening was 9% for loans to households for house purchase and 10% for consumer credit and 
other lending to households.

 1 Alternative scenarios for the impact 
of the C
OVID
-19 pandemic on economic activity in the euro area
 Prepared by 
Niccolò Battistini and Grigor Stoevsky
 The outbreak of the C
OVID
-19 pandemic has dramatically affected global 
economic 
activity since early 2020.
 The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) has required drastic measures to be taken, ranging from social distancing 
and the banning of public events to shutdowns, lockdowns and restrictions on 
numerous activities. 
The 
severity of 
these measures has
 begun to ease
 in some 
jurisdictions,
 as authorities 
are 
proceed
ing
 to gradual
ly lift them and re
open 
certain 
sectors
 of the economies. Nevertheless, there 
could still 
be a prolonged period of 
social distancing and other conta
inment measures
 in force for some time. These 
containment measures have weighed on supply and 
Œ together with increased 
uncertainty and self
-isolation by individuals due to the rapid spread of the disease 
Œ have also induced households and firms to retrenc
h their spending, thereby reducing 
aggregate demand. Widespread closures of firms have triggered a marked 
deterioration in employment conditions, an increase in firms™ liquidity needs, and 
pronounced financial market disruptions. Despite the shortage of ti
mely hard data, it is 
already clear that there has been a decline in economic activity of an unprecedented 
magnitude.
 The high uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the C
OVID
-19 pandemic warrants an analysis based on alternative scenarios.
 There a
re high 
uncertainties surrounding the developments of the pandemic, the need for and 
effectiveness of containment measures, and the possible 
emergence of 
medical 
treatments and solutions. These uncertainties can be illustrated through a scenario 
analysis, based on broad narratives for the aforementioned factors and their economic 
impact. It should be noted that these are illustrative scenarios compiled by E
CB staff 
and, as such, they should 
not 
be seen as an indication of 
the 
forthcoming 
June 2020 
Eurosystem 
staff 
macroeconomic 
projections
 for the euro area and thus they do not 
pre
-empt in any way that projection exercise
. Moreover, this box focuses only
 on 
economic activity, while 
the forthcoming 
June 2020 Eurosystem 
staff 
macroeconomic 
projections
 will 
be a fully
-fledged projection exercise, including
 a detailed assessment
 of 
the 
inflation
 outlook.
 This box presents three alternative scenarios to illustrate
 the range of likely 
impacts of the C
OVID
-19 pandemic on the euro area economy.
 The scenarios 
vary according to a number of factors, namely the duration of the strict lockdown 
measures and their impact on sectoral economic activity, the economic effects of
 protracted containment measures during a post
-lockdown transition period, the 
behavioural responses by economic agents to minimise economic disruptions, and the 
longer
-lasting effects for economic activity once all containment measures have been 
lifted. T
his scenario 
analysis
 for the euro area is based on the same broad narratives

 Alternative scenarios for the impact of the COVID
-19 pandemic on economic activity in the 
euro area
  26 for the global economy (and thus for the euro area foreign demand),
 while it 
abstracts 
from further feedback loops 
related to financial market disruptions or long
-term 
implicatio
ns of persistently high unemployment.
 The different assumptions underlying the three illustrative 
alternative 
scenarios 
imply a range spanning from mild to severe expected economic impact.
 In the 
first (
mild
) scenario, strict lockdown and further containme
nt measures, as well as 
rapid advances in medical treatments, entail relatively short
-lived strict lockdown 
periods (ending in the course of May 2020), a gradual return to normal activity 
thereafter and only temporary economic losses. In the second (
medium
) scenario, a 
short
-lived strict lockdown period (also ending in the course of May 2020) is followed 
by relatively stringent and protracted containment measures, implying a delayed 
return to normal activity, as well as persistent output losses. In the thir
d (severe
) scenario, a longer
-term strict lockdown period (ending in the course of June 2020) has 
only 
limited success in containing the spread of the virus
, thus requiring ongoing tough
 containment measures 
to remain in place
 even after some loosening of 
the very strict 
lockdowns. The 
sustained efforts to prevent the spread of the virus would continue to 
significantly dampen activity across sectors of the economy until 
a vaccin
e (or another 
effective medical solution) 
were to 
become available
. This is not expected 
to occur 
until 
around mid
-2021. Therefore, this scenario envisages significant and permanent 
output losses.
 Containment measures during the lockdown periods have a diverse impact 
across economic sectors in the euro area.
 The c
ollapse
 in activity is initially the 
strongest for services, particularly those related to travel and recreational activities.
 This has already been indicated by some of the available survey evidence. However, 
the lockdown measures and the ensuing 
supply 
bottlene
cks reduce 
production 
dramatically
, also 
across 
large segments 
of 
the 
industry
. Overall, the containment 
measures are assumed to cause a relatively larger loss of value added in r
etail trade, 
transport
, accommodation
 and 
food service activities
 compared to
 manufacturing, 
construction and other sectors (see Table A).
 The sectoral breakdown is indicative and 
based on anecdotal evidence and available survey evidence. It helped derive 
economy
-wide estimates for the likely economic losses, which are broadly in l
ine with 
available estimates from other institutions.
 The total initial economic 
loss 
implied 
during the lockdown is estimated to amount to around 
30% 
Œ depending on the 
country 
Œ of value added
 relative to the normal level of activity. On account of agent
s™ 
responses aimed at minimising economic disruptions, the total initial economic 
loss
es 
are assumed to decline 
in 
the course of the second quarter of 
2020. Under the 
assumptions used for these illustrative scenarios, 
the 
marginal 
impact of an additional 
month of lockdown measures on 
the 
annual GDP 
level 
is 
initially, approximately, 
between 2 and 
2½ 
percent

act (by around 20

the course of the second

. Str
ict
 containment measures 
are expected to 
severely affect economic activity 
in the euro area well 
beyond the short
-term horizon.
 The sectoral approach used 
to assess the economic losses associated with the COVID
-19 pandemic allows for the 
calculation of a time profile of i
ndicative losses 
(as a percentage of maximum sectoral 
losses
) implied by 
the 
viru
s containment measures in the euro area 
under
 the 
three 
alternative scenarios (see Chart A). T
he maximum sectoral losses (including direct 
and carry

assumed to occur in the first week of April 2020. The 
economic losses due to lockdowns be
gan to build up in March 
Œ as different countries 
enforced lockdown measures 
Œ and after reaching a peak at the beginning of April, 
they are expected to decline to close to 50% of their maximum level by mid
-May, 
end
-May and in the course of June under the 
mild, medium and severe scenarios, 
respectively, as looser containment measures allow for a gradual restart of economic 
activity. While 
containment 
measures

on activity stemming from the pandemic

cted to exhaust their negative 
impact by end

12% under the mild, medium and severe scenarios, respectively, in 2020 (see Chart 
C). The annual figure under the severe scenario reflects a quarterly real GDP growth 
reaching a trough of around 
-15% in the second quarter of 2020, followe
d by a 
protracted and incomplete recovery, entailing quarterly growth rates of around 6% and 
3%, respectively, in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. As 
containment measures 
allow for a gradual normalisation of economic activity, real GDP is expected to
 increase by around 6%, 5% and 4% under the mild, medium and severe
 scenarios, 
respectively, in 2021
. The uncertain epidemiology of the virus, the expected diverse 
effectiveness of containment measures and the assumed persistent economic 
damage under the m
edium and severe scenarios would continue to weigh on the 
economic recovery throughout the horizon. Under the severe scenario, in particular, 
real GDP is expected to remain well below the level observed at the end of 2019
 until 
the end of 2022.

 These illustrative scenarios abstract from a number of other relevant factors

euro area.
 The

prospective negative real

other non

 such as

 The fall in manufacturing and services activity in the euro area: foreign versus domestic

  31 2 The f

ctivity in the euro 
area: foreign
 versus domestic shocks
 Prepared by Rober
to A. De Santis
 The coronavirus (COVID
-19) pandemic, which has brought human suffering and 
disruption in economic activity globally, ha
s affected manufacturing and 
services activity in all euro area countries
. Economic growth in the euro area 
will be severely undermined in the short term.
 Thr
ee concomitant developments 
have adversely affected economic growth in the euro area since the beg
inning of 
2018: (i) a weakening in global trade, 
related in part to
 rising 
international 
trade
 tensions and persistent 
policy uncertainty
 surrounding Brexit;
 (ii) a fall in automotive 
production, mainly owing to a decline in foreign demand as well as the introduction of 
more stringent environmental regulations in Europe
; and (iii) a
 severe 
drop
 in 
economic activity as a result of the corona
virus.
 Between Janua
ry 2018 and 
February 
2020, despite the weakness in manufacturing in the euro area, 
the service
s sector as 
a whole 
Œ in particular market services 
Œ remained relatively resilient
 (see 
Chart 
A). In 
March, however, economic activity in both sectors fell sharp
ly owing to the pandemic. 
Survey
-based indicators
 such as the Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) (see 
Chart
s B and C
), business and consumer sentiment indicators,
 and other more timely statistics 
such as international air travel and energy consumption, all 
point to 
a severe downturn 
in both manufacturing and services in the euro area as well as in many other countries.

. It is estimated 
over the 
sam
ple period January 2007 to March 2020,
 partly
 because
 the 
economic relationships between
 countries 
may 
hav
e been different 
before 
the 
Great Recession in 2008
-09, but also to include data 
for China
. The
 model 
also controls for a global 
trade 
factor, which is proxied by the PMI
 for
 world new export 
orders
. To give more 
prominence to this global 
factor, 
it is assumed to 
only react with a 
lag to
 shocks generated by manufacturing and services o
utput in
 individual countr
ies
, while 
economic activity 
in each country reacts to global
 trade
 shocks 
contemporaneously. All 
the 
other 
eight 
variables are modelled 
assuming that 
a shock 
has an instantaneous effect on the variable that originated it which is larger in absolute 
value than its 
effect on 
other 
variables.
13 The econometric evidence c
orroborates the view that both foreign
 and 
domestic shocks to manufacturing activity play a key 
role in explaining the 
downturn in economic activity in the euro area 
between January 
2018 and 
February 2020
. The model results suggest that the foreign factor was the key reason 
for
 the weakness of 
manufacturing activity in the euro area in the first half
 of 2018, but 
since the summer of 2018 shocks
 which can be
 attributed to specific developments in
 the automotive sector 
have 
also 
played a central role.
 According to the econometric 
results, 53% of 
the decline in
 manufacturing activity in 2018 
is attribut
able
 to 
domestic
 factors
 (see Chart D)
. The evidence from PMIs corroborates the econometric results 
reported in the Economic Bulletin in September 2019 with the aim of explaining the 
drivers behind the fall in euro area industrial production growth at that 
time.
14 The 
stabilisation in the manufacturing output PMI recorded between January 2019 and 
February 2020 seems due to foreign developments, while domestic factors continued 
to be a drag on manufacturing activity. 
On the supply side, the introduction of 
cer
tain 
environmental regulations in the EU 
caused temporar
y supply disruptions in 
the 
automotive industry
. Some large car producers increased their efforts to raise local 
production and sales of electric cars. However, the required changes in factories may 
have entailed temporary production shortfalls. 
On the demand side, un
certainty about 
the diesel ban in some euro area countries 
caused a fall in demand 
for
 diesel cars and 
a switch to petrol cars
, in part
 imported from 
countries outside the euro area
. The 
automotive industry 
accounts for a large part of
 developments in capita
l goods and 
intermediate goods
, as it is highly
 inter
connected across sectors and countries
.15 It 
remains to be seen to what extent such temporary and structural domestic factors, 
which 
have play
ed a role in 
the weakness of euro area 
manufacturing activity
 in the 
recent past, may also affect the recovery in this sector in the future
. Services 
have 
also 
been 
negatively affected by 
foreign
 and domestic 
developments
 in manufacturing,
 given the relatively strong link between 
production in the car industry and certain services sectors
, although
 the 
service
s sector 
was
 more resilient 
up to February 2020

 The fall in

can be significant. 
Services can be negatively affected
 via t
he relatively s
trong links
 between production 
in the car industry
 and
 consumer finance and retailers. 
At the same time
, the service
s sector as a whole has remained more resilient
 than manufacturing
, since it was 
affected less by developments in the car industry and benefited, like all sectors, from 
favourable financing conditions
. The services output PMI started to decline from the 
second quarter of 2018
, initially 
owing
 to global trade developments
, which affected 
manufacturing 
directly 
and services
 indirectly, but then rose
 between January 2019 
and February 2020 
for the same reason
. However, activity will be significantly affected 
by the containment measures introduced to fight the coronavirus as w
ell as the policy 
response.

Shocks

the PMI indices
 in March 2020
, particularly in services,
 is 
unprecedented.
 Given the spread 
of the coronavirus
 across countries, it is 
reasonable to argue that output in March 2020 was driven by a global shock. Although 
services are less trade
-intensive, they have become strongly correlated globally owing 
to the pandemic and the common measures w
hich have been taken to contain it, 
namely the adoption of social distancing policies, as also recommended by the World 
Health Organization. The econometric model attributes a large fraction of 
the collapse 
in 
the 
manufacturing and services output 
PMIs for
 the euro area
 in March to the 
foreign factor, which is likely to reflect the fall in global trade and the lagged impact of 
the global slowdown given the sharp drop in economic activity in China in February. It 
is worth pointing out, however, that the euro
 area domestic factors also account for a 
significant part of the decline in both sectors in March 2020.

 Economic activity in the euro area fell

measures since March 2020,
 and the economic outlook will continue to be affected by

 Disentangling aggregate and sectoral shocks
  36 3 Disentangling aggrega
te and sectoral shocks
 Prepared by Maarten Dossche and Stylianos Zlatanos
 The growth slowdown in 2018
-2019 was characterised by a marked divergence 
of 
industrial production and reta
il sales
. Activity in b
oth 
sectors
 is 
usually 
characterised by positive 
co-move
ment
, particular
ly during recessions.
16 However, 
there are also episodes where the correlation between
 the 
growth
 of industrial 
production and retail sales 
is low or even turns negative 
(see Chart A). Despite a 
strong contraction in industrial productio
n, retail sales 
barely
 slowed 
in 
2018-2019. This box uses this co
-movement to 
uncover
 whether the euro area economy 
was hit 
by aggregate or sectoral shock
s. It then tries to understand whether these two shocks 
differ in their impact on output
 over time. 
The recent
 COVID
-19 shock is undoubtedly 
an aggregate shock
, hitting
 industrial production and retail sales s
imultaneously
. Yet 
its
 impact on economic activity over time remains uncertain
 as its characteristics differ 
substantially from past aggregate shocks

 Consumer theory can help to identify aggregate and sectoral shocks
. The 
permanent 
income 
hypothesis (PIH) predicts 
that only unexpected permanent (or 
persistent) shocks to aggregate income (or production) affect private consumption, 
whereas transitory shocks do not.
17 At the sectoral level
, the PIH implies that 
transitory shocks should only affect industrial production 
and not retail sales (i.e. 
consumption), while permanent shocks should affect 
activity in 
both 
sectors
. This 
difference can be used as
 a short

responses will, to some extent, mitigate the recessionary effects on household 
disposable incomes. 
Nevertheless, the impact on income and the increased 
uncertainty will most likely trigger significant changes in household consumption 
patterns. Moreover, the direct effects of the lockdown measures have already had an 
impact on consumption patterns, with 
some goods and services becoming temporarily 
unavailable.
 Households adjust consumption patterns in response to income and relative 
price shocks.
 For instance, when facing a reduction in disposable income, 
consumers tend to switch away from relatively more
 expensive to relatively less 
expensive goods or switch more strongly to ﬁnecessitiesﬂ.
22 This substitution happens 
across items and categories (e.g. food versus recreation) as well as
 across varieties
 within items 
(different brands of 
the same product
).23 In extreme 
circumstances
, consumers
 may even stop buying 
certain
 goods
 and services if their budget constraint 
becomes binding
. However, 
the HICP does not reflect 
such imminent and possibly 
temporary shifts. Its
 inflation numbers
 therefore
 tend to be highe
r than the increase in

 22  Additionally, a reduction in income 
may 
increase the extent that a household sw
itches within product 
categories, creating measurement challenges
. For example, assuming that the price of product X
 (the 
higher
-quality product)
 falls
 faster than that of product Y
 (the lower
-quality product) 
would normally 
suggest a shift in expenditure shares towards product X. However, if income constraints 
become binding
, then consumers may switch to products or items with lower prices
 (product Y)
 even if their relative price 
has increased. Such switche
s an
d substitution does not
 apply
 only
 to products
 but also 
to 
outlets.

 Note
: The chart shows the HICP weights for each category at different points in time. For each category, the weights are normalised
 so 
that the inner circle represents the lowest (weight) value since 2001 and the outer ring represents the highest (weight) valu
e since 2001.
 Past episodes of economic distress
 provide evidence for changes in 
consumption weights.
 Taking the 2008 financial crisis as an example, Chart A
 shows
 the weights across main HICP categories at two different points in time, normalised so 
that 
the inner and outer circles capture the minimum and maximum values for each 
category in the sample in the period 2001 to 2020.
25 The recession episode saw lower 
expenditure
 shares for durable and semi
-durable goods as well as housing and 
transport services,
 while shares for recreation and communication as well as energy, 
food and non
-durable goods increased.
26 At the current juncture, household consumption 
is affected by 
supply
-side 
constraints, such as closure of retailers 
or 
scarcity of products on the 
shelves.
 High
-frequency data suggests that the expenditure changes triggered by the current 
                                        
                           
 24  It should be noted that some euro area countries
- notably Belgium and the Netherlands, already make 
use of scanner data with a formula that captures changes 
in the
 quantities of product items sold.

example, see Chessa, A.
, ﬁA new methodology for processing scanner data in the Dutch CPI
ﬂ, 
EURONA

-69, July 
2016.
 25  A limitation to this analysis is that before 2010, HICP weights were only updated every fiv
e years in some 
countries 
and with 
a considerable delay (for example, for Germany, only three years
 later, 
so weights 
representing the base year 2000 were introduced in 2003 and used until 2008
). For this reason, we 
checked the evidence presented in Chart 
A using the weights of the personal consumption deflator (PCD) 
rather than the HICP. Overall, the evidence in Chart A was largely confirmed by the PCD weights.
 26  The weights presented in Chart A are an ex post reflection of expenditure changes as recorded
 in 
Eurostat weights for the year 2009. In practice, they might underestimate changes in real
-time 
expenditure shares and could be interpreted as a lower boundary given the timing of the weights 
adjustment, especially during a severe downturn.

 Inflation measurement in times of economic distress
  41 crisis might imply weights for individual categories outside the historical boundaries.
27 For example, as a result of the lockdown, consumption has moved away from e
nergy, 
durable and semi
-durable goods in favour of non
-durable goods and food items. 
Potentially, these changes in consumption patterns are unprecedented but most likely 
also temporary. In Chart A, this could imply that the weight for food items based on 
consumption patterns during the lockdown could lie on the outer edge of the graph for 
most categories, as it would be at the upper boundary of its historical range. Similarly, 
the implied weight for recreation based on consumption data for services like 
res
taurants, cafes and holiday items would lie at the inner edge of the historic weight 
developments. Having said this, the actual household consumption profile for the 
current year remains underpinned by a high degree of uncertainty.

 28  Consumers might face

 Inflation measuremen
t in times of economic distress
  42 Currently, the sub
-category posting the 
highest inflation rat
e is food, with energy 
seeing the largest contraction. Additionally, prices will respond endogenously to 
demand conditions; therefore, switching to or from a category might increase or 
decrease its inflation rate, respectively. For example, in the current 
situation, an 
increased demand for food or pharmaceutical items might lead to an additional 
increase in their prices.
 The restrictive measures implemented by Europe
an governments
 in reaction to 
COVID
-19 Œ such 
as closure
s of shops
 or travel 
restrictions
 Œ also have a direct 
impact on price collection
. The 
lockdown
 disrupted
 the collection of prices needed 
to compile the HICP
 in several countries
, sometimes even when 
outlets remained 
open.
30 The HICP framework mandates 
the 
imputation
 of missing prices, which 
may 
be done 
either by referring to other price 
indices
 from the same or a higher product 
category 
(as far 
up 
as 
the all
-item
s level)
 or by carrying forward prices that were 
actually collected in a previous month
.31 Seasonality in price 
indices
 may be impute
d by referring to the seasonal profile from the previous year. Eurostat and the 
national 
statistical institutes 
provid
e metadata 
on the
 imputation methods applied and 
a list of 
the 
sub
-indices
 affected.
 In terms of expenditure shares, 
4.8% of price indices
32 for 
the 
March 
euro area HICP are labelled 
as being of 
ﬁlow 
reliab
ility
ﬂ. This 
percentage
 is 
expected to increase in April.
33 Metadata already published by Eurostat in the flash 
estimate of 30 April show that 35% of the prices of the euro area HICP were im
puted.
34 The imputations will increase the relative importance of the reliable indices in 
the HICP.
 Their weight is implicitly increased if missing items are imputed using either 
other single sub
-indices or aggregates thereof. The H
ICP 
figures will 
therefore be 
driven by aggregate sub
-indices
 for which there is a reasonable hypothesis that sales 
have continued and
 for which the
 underlying prices are largely based on actual 
transactions
, like food 
(19.1%)
 and energy 
(9.8%)
, which together account for
 about 
29% of the total HICP basket
. These two categories 
accounted for most of the
 variance
 in the HICP in the last couple of years
.35 Other categories that could provide 
reliable information are communication services and rents as they may have been less 
affected by the lockdown. 
On top of 
these compilation issues
, the possibility that some
 specific items
 show large price changes because of supply shortages cannot be ruled 
out
. Overall, the impact 
of price collection issues 
on 
the 
HICP cannot be 
anticipated
 and 
upcoming
 HICP releases should be interpreted with caution.
 The COVID
-19-related economic developments pose challenges for inflation 
analysts.

 the estimated price change is assumed to be zero over the period of imputation.

 1 The transmission of exchange rate changes to euro area 
inflation
 Prepared by Eva Ortega, Chiara Osbat and Ieva Rubene
 1 Introduction
 Exchange rate changes play an important role in explaini
ng inflation 
developments.
 Understanding 
how
 exchange 
rate
s are
 pass
ed through
 to inflation 
and growth
 is a crucial part of economic analysis
. This article summari
ses the findings 
of a research group comprised of experts from the 
European System of Central
 Banks
 (ESCB) who, over the past two years, reviewed and analysed the
 exchange rate 
pass
-through (ERPT) 
to inflation in Europe.
36 This article provides updated empirical estimates of 
the ERPT
 to import and 
consumer prices in the euro area and EU countries.
 A clear distinction is made 
between estimates that rely on reduced
-form equations, which represent conditional
 correlations (ERPT)
, and the pass
-through of 
identified shocks, which are defined as 
the ﬁp
rice
-to-exchange
-rate
 ratio
ﬂ, or the 
PERR. 
All of thes
e estimates 
corroborate the 
general finding in the li
terature that the impact of the exchange rate on 
prices weakens 
along the pricing chain. The ERPT to consumer prices
, obtained from the 
reduced
-form equations,
 is about 
one
-tenth 
that 
of the ERPT to impo
rt prices
. These 
estimates are 
generally 
found
 to be
 stable since the 
end of the 19
90s, but lower than 
those
 obtained in the literature for earlier decades. 
The estimates also suggest that 
the ERPT in the
 euro area is stronger for large exchange rate chang
es compared 
with
 small ones.
 Structural characteristics
, such as
 trade openness, integration in international 
production chains, the currency of invoicing of trade
 and
 market power
, are key 
in explaining differences in the ERPT across countries
 and industr
ies
. In line 
with the literature, an analysis using 
micro and sectoral 
data, as well as findings based 
on 
structural macroeconomic 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
 models
, suggest
s that increased participation in global value chains, larger market shares, 
invoicing of euro area imports in euro (local currency pricing) and a large proportion of 
local distribution costs reduce 
the 
ERPT to import prices. 
In contrast, the 
ERPT to 
consum
er prices
 increases when imports account for a greater share of 
consumption 
and 
the
 domestic distribution sector 
is more competitive

 The transmission of exchange rate changes to euro area inflation
  45 In addition to the 
above
-mentioned 
structural factors, the relative dynamics of 
prices and the exchange rate depend on the
 shock 
to which 
they react.
 The 
distinction between the dependence on the type of shock and structural characteristics 
is partly a simplification since the two interact: for example, a small, very open country 
will tend to be more affected by foreign shock
s, while a country whose imports are 
mostly invoiced in euro will tend to experience a lower ERPT. Therefore, the 
shock
-dependency of the ERPT for any country may be intertwined with the other 
structural characteristics, but the article abstracts from this
 consideration. Results 
based on
 structural models
 suggest that
 the response of consumer prices 
(relative to 
that of the exchange rate
) is somewhat larger 
when the exchange rate moves because
 of shocks to monetary policy and
 to the exchange rate itself
, than when the exchange 
rate moves because of 
shocks to domestic aggregate supply.
 The 
pass
-through of exchange rates to inflation depends on 
monetary policy.
 Simulations based on s
tructural
 model
s show that the more credible and effective 
monetary policy is 
in counteracting inflationary pressures, the lower the reduced
-form 
empirical 
estimates of 
the 
ERPT
 to import and consumer prices will be
. This 
analysis 
also 
shows that 
when the central bank faces an effective lower bound for monetary 
policy rates, the 
ERP
T is higher
 in the presence of 
interest rate forward guidance and 
other non
-standard measures
, such as exchange rate floors.
 2 Main empirical facts
 2.1
 Measuring the impact of the exchange rate on prices
 When thinking about exchange rate pass
-through, and 
particularly when 
comparing estimates from different studies,
 it is crucial to distinguish between 
two 
definitions
 of ERPT used in the literature.
 The first definition refers to the 
estimated size of the response of prices (import or consumer) to changes i
n the 
exchange rate in a reduced
-form pricing equation. ERPT defined in this way is the 
estimated coefficient on the exchange rate in a linear regression. The second 
definition refers to the 
response of prices 
relative 
to that of the exchange rate after an
y (exogenous) 
shock
 that moves the exchange rate. Its estimation requires a structural 
model with feedback effects, such as structural vector autoregression (SVAR) or 
DSGE models.
37 The ESCB expert group introduced the term ﬁp
rice
-to-exchange
-rate
 ratio
ﬂ (PERR) 
for the second concept. The PERR more richly reflects the 
co-movement of prices and exchange rates
, because it captures the 
various channels 
of transmission of
 an underlying economic 
shock
, which are not modelled in single 
reduced
-form equations. T
his article uses the ﬁERPTﬂ when referring to the first 
concept, distinguishing it from the relative response of prices (or real quantities) and 
exchange rates (PERR) when analysing shock
-dependence.
                                         
                           
 37  The first notion of ERPT can also be retrieved from the SVAR and DSGE models, but it refers to the 
exchange rate pass
-through parameter in a pricing equation, all else being equal. Hence, it abstracts 
from all the endogenous responses and feedback effects that are embedded by structural models.

  46 2.2
 Estimates for the euro area using various approaches
 A robust
 finding in the empirical literature is that the 
impact of exchange rates
 on inflation 
declines 
along
 the pricing chain.
 It is highest and fastest for import 
prices at the border, but significantly smaller and slower for final consumer prices
, as 
nominal rigidities and other wedges accumulate across the production process 
all the 
way through to
 the final consumer prices. Generally
, a simultaneous co
-movement 
of 
the
 nominal effective exchange rate and prices is strong in the case of import prices, 
much weaker in the case of the 
producer 
price 
index (PPI) and barely noticeable 
for
 the consumer prices of non
-energy industrial goods
 (see 
Chart 
1). Chart 1

-38 refers to the nominal effective exchange rate against 38 trading partners. The l
atest 
observation
s are for December 
2019. Reduced
-form estimates show 
that the ERPT to consumer prices is about 
one
-tenth of the ERPT to import prices.
 ERPT estimates found in the literature are 
often based on different measures of import price or consumer price inflation and 
alternative measures of exchange rates, and are estimated over different time periods. 
Using consistent data, the 
evidence from red
uced
-form models suggests that a 1% 
depreciation of the euro raises total import prices in the euro area 
(including internal 
euro area trade) 
and its member countries by
, on average,
 about 0.30% within a year
. Over the same period, h
eadline HICP rises by a
bout 0.0
4%, although the estimates 
are not always significantly different from zero.
 These 
estimates
 for import and 
consumer prices
 are at
 the low 
end
 of the range of those found in the literature.

 The transmission of exchange rate changes to euro area inflation
  48 non
-euro area
 EU 
countries 
is considerably higher
 than in euro ar
ea countries, partly 
reflecting intra
-euro area trade being included in the estimates for the latter.
41 Empirical
 evidence 
for
 a non
-linear response of exchange rates in 
the euro area
 and its member countries 
is 
rather 
scarce
. A number of factors may cause 
a non
-linear response of import or consumer prices to exchange
 rate changes.
 Empirical 
studies suggest that 
the impact on prices may
 depend on the direction of 
change
 (appreciation or depreciation)
42 or 
the size of the change
. The impact can also 
change wit
h the state of the economy (for example, at different points in the business 
cycle and at different levels or variability of inflation).
43 New estimates that look at 
ERPT non
-linearity for the euro area and its member countries find that, 
after one year
, only large changes in the exchange rate have an impact on euro area import prices 
and headline HICP, which is consistent with
, for example,
 sticky prices 
due to 
menu 
costs.
44 This study also finds that the ERPT to euro area import and consumer prices 
does not
 differ
 between
 depreciations and appreciations, 
which is 
in line
 with findings 
for the real exchange rate in the euro area.
45 The ERPT across countries varies not only at 
the
 macro level, but also across 
sectors.
 A number 
of studies have shown that the pas
s-through
 to import prices 
is higher for energy compared 
with
 manufacturing products
, as exporters appear to 
price
-discriminate to a larger extent between markets for manufacturing goods than
 between
 those for commodities.
46 An u
pdate of earlier work
 on the
 ERPT to import 
prices in the euro area confirms these findings.
47 More specifically, the ERPT is found 
to be higher for euro area import prices in energy
-related industries compared with 
manufacturing.
 Similar findings have 
also 
been reported for the ERPT
 to producer 
prices. Among the sub
-sectors of industry (excl
uding
 construction), the ERPT 
to 
producer prices 
is largest in electricity, gas and water supply, as well as in the energy 
sector, 
and
 lowest for capital goods.

 The transmission of exchange rate changes to euro area inflation
  49 3 Structural characteristics 
are ke
y to
 explaining ERPT 
heterogeneity
 The link between the exchange rate and inflation depends on the structural 
characteristics of industries
 and 
countries and 
how these characteristics 
evolve
 over time
. Particularly relevant
 factors are t
he structure of the
 economy, the 
microeconomic structure and behaviour of firms, and the general macroeconomic 
environment
, which are mirrored in the following structural characteristics of countries 
and sectors
: trade openness and import penetration
, integration in global v
alue 
chains
, the currency of trade invoicing
 and the 
degree of competition and market 
concentration
. It is difficult to disentangle the effects of these factors, as they are 
intertwined and jointly determine the differences in the ERPT across countries and
 industries and over time. This section reviews the implications for the ERPT of each of 
these four structural characteristics separately, but refrains from ranking them by 
importance.
 3.1
 Trade openness
 The 
more open a country is
 to imports
, the higher th
e impact of the exchange 
rate on import and consumer prices.
 Trade liberali
sation, lower trade costs and 
technological advances have boosted cross
-border trade flows and favoured the 
organisation of production in cross
-border production chains. 
Openness, a
s measured 
by the share of external trade in GDP, varies substantially across the euro area and 
non
-euro area EU economies 
Œ with smaller countries generally being more open to 
trade. C
ompared 
with
 1999, in most EU countries 
imports now account for a highe
r percentage of GDP
 (see 
Chart 
3). Chart 3

share of 
imports 
in private consumption 
is very important for the
 ERPT to 
consumer prices.

  50 parts. The first measures the share of final consumer products imported from other 
countries directly (direct import conte
nt). The second measures the share of 
foreign 
inputs used 
to produce 
domestic 
consumer goods
 (usually referred to as ﬁindirect 
import 
content
ﬂ). The t
otal 
(direct and indirect
) import content of private consumption in the euro 
area was around 16% in 2014
 and has been trending slightly upwards since 
1999.49 The import content of private consumption varies across countries, but for 
most countries the direct import share is approximately half of the total import content 
(see 
Chart 
4). Simulation results from structural DSGE models show that low home 
bias (i.e. a high import content in consumption) is a key channel for exchange rate 
changes to have 
a greater
 impact on prices, 
as emphasi
sed in the literature.

 3.2
 Integration in 
global 
value 
chains
 Another important determinant of the size of 
the 
ERPT is the integration in 
global value chains not only of a country, but also of its trading partners.
 When 
countries that export to the euro area
 source 
part of 
their inputs from the 
euro area 
itself
, a change in the euro
 exchange rate 
will have
 a limited pass
-through to 
euro area
 import prices because of counter
balancing
 effects on the input costs side
. Higher participation in 
global value chains
 is likely to reduce
 the 
ERPT.
 A structural two
-country model with trade in intermediate goods and staggered 
price
-setting shows that the
 higher the participation of a country™s trading partners in

is confirmed by an industry

 that the higher the

52 The degree to which euro area consumer prices depend upon prices of inputs 
from outside the euro area is rather limited.
 A recent 
study finds that supply chain 
trade, both among domestic 
sectors and across countries, is an important determinant 
of consumer prices.
53 The estimated supply chain spillovers to consumer prices can 
be decomposed according to the country of origin, revealing that
 the 
relative weight
 of 
foreign
 input costs for the 
euro area as a whole is rather 
small
 after accounting for the 
effect of oil prices (see
 Chart 
5). Results for 
individual 
countries 
vary
, but reveal 
relatively
 strong pr
oduction linkages within 
the 
euro area
, which 
could 
dampen the 
exchange rate impact on domestic consumer prices.
 At the same time, an 
analysis 
using
 a DSGE for the euro area
 finds that removing the import content of production 
and exports would

sensitivity of prices to exchange rate changes

  52 imports
 for most countries
 is invoiced in euro
. This
 suggest
s a limited ERPT to euro 
area prices
, as the share of euro area imports directly exposed to exchange rate 
fluctuations is small. Moreover, due to 
both 
the relatively large size of the euro area 
compared 
with
 other non
-euro are
a EU countries
 and 
to 
the 
Single 
Market framework 
of the European Union, it is likely that trade within the EU is predominantly invoiced in 
euro.

 Note: Data refer to 2018, except

 Estonia and 
the 
euro area
, where they refer
 to 2016.
 The invoicing decision serves as an active channel through which producers 
adjust their prices 
according
 to their own market power and local competition 
conditions
.56 If an exporting firm invoices in its own currency
, so
-called producer 
currency pricing,
 its prices will be more sensitive to its own costs and less to the 
importer™s conditions. This will increase
 the
 ERPT to the importer™s import prices. By 
contrast, inv
oicing in the destination™s currency
, so
-called local currency pricing,
 will 
reduce the ERPT. Finally, exports invoiced in a third currency
, so
-called dominant 
currency pricing, 
also make prices less sensitive to the bilateral exchange rate and 
more to the
 developments of the dominant currency.
 However, the decision on what 
currency to invoice in mostly affects ERPT in the near to medium term. In the long run 
(often not captured by empirical models), producers can change the prices they 
charge when negotiat
ing a new contract, irrespective of the currency of invoicing.
 These conceptual considerations are supported by two new empirical 
country
-specific studies using micro data.
 One finds a significantly higher 
pass
-through on impact for Danish import prices de
nominated in other currencies 
                                        
                           
 55  According to Eurostat data, i
mports in non
-euro area EU countries are invoiced mostly in dominant 
currencies (US dollar and euro).
 Imports of petroleum goods in most euro area countries are mainly 
denominated in US dollars. In some countries
, the high share of dollar invoicing may 
also 
be related to 
the activity of multinational enterprises (e.g. 
in 
Ireland, the Netherlands and Malta
). 56  See, for example,

57 Another study uses 
a firm
-level analysis of Italian exports and finds 
a substantially 
lower ERPT to Italian export prices 
with
 local currency pri
cing 
than 
with dominant 
currency pricing
, whereas the ERPT is 
highest 
with
 producer currency pricing.
58 Taking into account the share of import invoicing in euro mechanically reduces 
the impact of exchange rates via the openness channel.
 Trade openness of t
he 
total economy, as measured by extra
-euro area imports as a share of GDP and the 
import content of private consumption, would be reduced by almost half when 
excluding transactions denominated in euro.
59 For this reason, these measures may 
overestimate the
 potential sensitivity of prices to exchange rate movements if the 
currency of invoicing is not taken into account. An alternative would be to adjust the 
exchange rate measures, for example by exploring 
the use of invoicing currency 
weights as a complement
 to trade weights when computing nominal effective 
exchange rates or competitors™ export price 
indices
.60 3.4
 Market power
 ERPT
 decreases 
as the market share of exporters increases, because
 firms with 
greater
 market power tend to adjust their markups
 in response to exchange rate 
changes in order to keep market shares constant.
 In other words, when 
competition is low the ERPT 
can be expected to be
 low. However
, there 
may be
 a U-shape
d relationship between 
the 
ERPT and market power. Under monopolistic 
competition, 
the market shares of 
both very small and very large exporters face little 
impact 
if they
 chang
e their price
s, and 
they would thus 
pass
 through most of the 
exchange rate movement to selling prices. 
Empirical evidence of this non
-linearity is 
inc
onclusive, as some studies 
find 
that
 the 
ERPT 
decreases monotonically 
with 
market share
61, while
 others confirm the 
U-shaped relationship
.62 Another possible 
non
-linearity can be related to funding constraints: 
financially constrained firms may 
have a higher
 ERPT, as they
 find 
it 
harder to hedge against exchange rate changes.
63 Large firms
, however,
 may be able to resort to exchange rate hedging via financial 
instruments, which would further decrease the sensitivity of their prices to exchange 
rate movements.

  54 Local distribution margins also matter.
 When f
aced with
 strong competition
, local 
distributors absorb exchange rate fluctuations in their margins
, thus reducing
 pass
-through to consumer prices compared 
with
 prices at the border. An analysis 
using daily transaction
-level data for package holiday consumer prices in Germany 
finds 
that the 
ERPT
 is lower
 for services with higher markups (more productive firms or 
firms selling higher
-quality goods) and also for th
ose with higher distribution costs.
65 4 ERPT variation: the shocks matter
 In addition to the structural determinants discussed above, the impact of 
exchange rates on inflation also depend
s on the combination of shocks 
affecting
 the economy at each point in 
time
.66 Seven different DSGE models for 
the euro area were used to obtain simulations for four types of shocks: an exogenous 
exchange rate shock, 
a domestic demand 
shock, a domestic 
supply shock and a 
monetary policy shock. As described in Section 2.1, the 
PERR
 is an appropriate 
measure 
of the 
impact of the exchange rate on inflation
 when analysed through the 
lens of DSGE models
, therefore the results for this measure are discussed below
. The median results across the models show that the 
relative 
response o
f import prices 
to the exchange rate
 (the price
-to-exchange rate ratio, or PERR)
 is highest following a 
monetary policy shock. It is also rather high after an exchange rate shock, but 
somewhat smaller after demand and supply shocks (see panel (a) in 
Chart 
7). The 
PERRs for consumer prices are smaller than for import prices after all shocks, albeit 
the difference declines at longer horizons. The relative importance of sho
cks is similar 
(see panel (b) in 
Chart 
7). Overall, the results are rather similar across these models 
for the exchange rate and monetary policy shocks. Uncertainty is larger for the 
responses to aggregate demand and supply shocks, as reflected by rather wide 
interquartile ranges of the outcomes, 
particularly at longer time horizons.

 Estimates of PERR responses
 obtained using 
structural 
VAR models
 (SVAR)
 show similar responses at impact
 to those obtained using DSGE models
, but 
a somewhat different path thereafter.
 This reflects the nature of DSGE
 models as, 
compared with SVAR mod
els, they more explicitly model structural features of the 
economy such as price stickiness, import content, effects of the distribution sector and 
switching from domestic goods to foreign goods in response to price changes. In 
addition, DSGE models encomp
ass rich feedback interactions within an economy that 
are captured less explicitly in SVAR models (such as monetary policy responses).
 Sensitivity analysis 
confirms
 that 
the 
structural characteristics of 
the
 economy 
matter for
 the 
PERR
 after an exchange rate shock
. Simulations performed using a 
euro area DSGE model developed in De 
Walque et al.
 show that a higher nominal 
rigidity of 
import price
s visibly lowers the PERR
 for import prices 
at the border
.68 This 
effect disappears after arou
nd a year, beyond which prices are allowed to adjust in the 
baseline specification. Less use of imported intermediate products in domestic 
production, including for producing exports, in turn increases the consumer price 
PERR, because a higher share of dom
estic consumption is subject to 
expenditure
-switching effects and monetary policy reacts more actively. Distribution 
sector margins were 
not 
found to have a significant impact on the results.

 The transmission of exchange rate changes to euro area inflation
  56 combination of shocks determines 
movements in the exchange rate 
at any 
point 
in time
 is a much more uncertain task
. Recent literature advocates using 
SVAR models to obtain such exch
ange rate decompositions.
70 The results from four 
alternative SVAR models for the euro area reveal that the outcomes are relatively 
similar in terms of the response of prices to a given type of shock, but rather different 
across the models in terms of the h
istorical contributions of each shock to exchange 
rate changes through time.
71 This large uncertainty about the exact shock 
decomposition at a given point in time cautions against relying on one specific model 
when evaluating which shocks drive exchange rat
e changes.
 Although this article mainly focuses on
 analysing
 the 
impact of the 
exchange 
rate on prices, 
the model
-based analysis used naturally also provides 
information on the impact of exchange rates on growth.
 In parallel with the PERR, 
the growth
-to-exchange
-rate ratio estimates obtained from DSGE models show that 
real GDP growth in the euro area increases following exchange rate depreciations that 
are due to monetary policy shocks. However, the uncertainty surrounding the 
estimates is somewhat larger f
or growth than for prices.

ín This box examines the link between the exchange rate and real GDP growth over time, which is 
closely related to 
analysing the impact on inflation of the exchange rate
. Indirect transmission 
channels 
through the real economy 
are important
, because 
exchange rate 
movements affect 
not only 
prices but also 
economic activity, which, in turn
, might trigger price changes
. The exercise is conducted through the simulation of multiple models: DSGE open
-economy models 
and structural VAR models for the euro area.
72 The models entail different specifications and values

 The transmission of exchange rate changes to euro area inflation
  58 consumer prices increase following the increase in 
euro area
 import prices. The central bank raises 
the monetary policy rate to counterbalance higher inflation
 pressures. T
he higher monetary policy 
rate and risk premium induce hou
seholds and firms to reduce consumption and investment in the 
euro area
. Thus, 
GDP increases only slightly 
due to
 higher net exports.
 The sensitivity analysis for the UIP shock gives an indication of the respective role of the different 
structured factors 
examined: (i) wholesale (border) import prices are fully flexible; (ii) there is no 
distribution sector; (iii) there are no foreign intermediate inputs in domestic production; and (iv) 
exports do not have import content.
77 The results show that, first, in t
he absence of 
import price 
nominal rigidities, 
the implied import price response at the border is 
nearly twice as large on impact 
but returns to the benchmark after one year. Second, in the absence of distribution sector margins, 
the e
xpenditure
-switching 
effect induced by the devaluation is stronger, such th
at net trade and GDP 
improve compared with the benchmark. Third, once
 foreign intermediate inputs
 are removed
 from
 the 
list of production factors, the 
calibration of the share of imported consumption go
ods is doubled in 
order
 to keep the import
-to-GDP ratio unchanged across different simulations. The 
greater
 weight of 
imported goods in the consumption basket magnifies the effect of the exchange 
rate on consumer 
price dynamics, monetary policy and GDP gro
wth accordingly. Finally, when 
both foreign intermediate 
inputs and the import content of exports are set to zero
, and
 the calibrated share of imports in the 
consumption basket is increased to match the import
-to-GDP ratio
, the GDP response becomes
 about 
four
 times larger than in the benchmark for the first year
. The estimates of the effect of the exchange rate changes on GDP growth reveal a rather high 
disagreement across the models. 
The growth
-to-exchange
-rate ratio estimates obtained from 
seven 
euro area
 DSGE models suggest that real GDP growth in the euro area rapidly increases in the short
 term
 following exchange rate depreciations that are due to monetary policy and domestic supply 
shocks
 (see Table A)
. However, depreciations due to exogenous exchange 
rate shocks explain a very 
small percentage of the change in GDP growth. 
The results obtained from four SVAR models, in turn, 
show s
izeable effects across models for exogenous exchange rate shocks and domestic demand 
shocks. 
Overall, t
he impact of exchange
 rate shocks on GDP growth is less evident than 
it is 
on 
prices. 
After general equilibrium effects and time series dynamics are taken into account, the 
uncertainty surrounding the estimates is larger for growth than for prices.

. 5 Conclusions
 The impact of exchange rate changes on inflation 
depends on the 
shocks and 
on the reaction 
of monetary policy
. Finding a small uncondi
tional impact empirically 
does not therefore mean that the exchange rate has no impact on inflation.
 When
 considering
 the shock
-dependence of 
the ERPT
, it is important to distinguish between 
the ERPT estimate in a pricing equation and the relative response
 of prices and 
exchange rates to a structural shock.
 In fact,
 the more credibly and effectively 
monetary policy counteracts external inflationary pressures, the lower ex
 post 
statistical estimates of
 the 
ERPT
 will be when estimated using reduced
-form 
equat
ions, whereas estimates from structural models are less affected
. The exchange 
rate channel is important for domestic inflation shocks as well. An interest rate hike 
after a
n inflationary
 domestic 
demand
 shock would imply an exchange rate 
appreciation and 
hence a fall in import prices, which would counterbalance the
 initial
 domestic inflation pressures
.79 For the euro area
, the exchange rate serves as 
a crucial transmission channel 
not only for conventional, but also for unconventional monetary policy.
80 Mode
l simulations show that, under the effective lower bound and with credible f
orward 
guidance
 of continued unchanged 
interest rates
, the relative response of inflation and 
exchange rates will be higher than without forward guidance. This finding is robust 
across the seven euro area DSGE models that underlie the results reported in this 
article (see the notes for Chart 7). These result
s suggest that 
the monetary policy 
                                        
                           
 79  Agents expect interest rate changes that will move the exchange rate so that
 import prices will return 
back to their steady state values. Hence, these shocks will have a relatively low impact on import price 
inflation if the policy is expected to react aggressively

 Negative rates and the tra
nsmission of monetary policy
  61 2 Negative rates and the transmission of monetary policy
 Prepared by 
Miguel Boucinha
 and 
Lorenzo Burlon
83 1 Introduction
 As structural and cyclical factors 
have brought nominal interest rates closer to 
zero, the need to ease financing conditions further has prompted the adoption 
of a negative interest rate policy (NIRP)
. The introduction of negative policy rates 
has 
been part of a comprehensive policy strateg
y adopted by the ECB since mid
-2014 
in order to stave off the unprecedented disinflationary forces that 
arose 
in the 
aftermath of the global and sovereign debt crises.
 The ECB has cut its deposit facility 
rate (DFR) into negative territory five times since
 2014. 
The 
latest
 lowering of the 
DFR
 in September 2019 and the 
associated 
market expectations 
of a 
longer period of 
negative rates
 have 
reignited
 the question of how negative rates are transmitted to the 
economy, especially through banks, and whether they
 may have counter
-productive 
effects by impinging on banks™ intermediation capacity.
 Negative rates 
are transmitted 
via 
different channels
. Negative 
rates 
soften 
the 
expectation of markets that 
current and future short
-term
 rates
 cannot be negative. By 
low
ering the perceived lower bound of central bank rates, negative rates allow 
the 
monetary accommodation to propagate 
through
 the entire yield curve. 
Moreover, 
investor demand for longer
-dated assets increases
 more than when rates are positive
, exerting furt
her downward pressure on 
the term premium, i.e. 
the
 compensation that 
investors demand 
for the uncertainty regarding the future path of 
interest 
rates.
 Finally, 
commercial banks are 
incentivised
 to expand lending 
so as 
to 
avoid
 the 
negative rate 
applied to 
their excess holdings
 of reserves with the central bank (excess liquidity) in a 
situation in which the cost of liabilities is partially constrained
. The 
transmission of 
NIRP
 via ba
nks could in principle be hindered by potential 
lar
ge-scale shifts
 into cash
 and downward pressure on bank profitability
. The 
transmission of 
monetary 
policy 
could be diluted if investors
 hoard cash rather than 
rebalanc
ing
 their portfolios towards longer
-term or riskier assets. So far there are no 
signs of
 large
-scale liquidity ﬁ
leakage
sﬂ of this type
, mainly 
owing 
to the costs of 
forgoing
 the services provided by 
central bank reserves or commercial bank deposits
 as 
a means 
of conducting

. Box 2 describes the transmission of negative rates in 
money markets. Section 4 reports empirica
l evidence on how negative rates 
affect
 the 
broader economy.
 Section 5 concludes.
 2 The transmission of negative interest rates
 In June 2014 the ECB introduced NIRP as part of a broad credit easing package, 
leading to lower bank deposit and lending rates.
 NIRP shares some of the basic 
easing features of a standard interest rate cut, as is evident in the reaction of bank 
funding and lending rates to the original cut in the DFR into negative territory as well as 
to the subsequent reductions (see Chart 1). Ho
wever, when rates are below zero, 
additional channels are activated. Some enhance the stimulus provided by the cut, 
while others can dampen transmission via banks.
 NIRP reduces bank 
funding cost
s, stimulating loan supply
. Composite funding 
costs for euro a
rea banks 
have been compressed 
since 2014
, helping to maintain
 intermediation 
margins for banks with an average funding structure. Moreover, there is 
evidence that, as negative rates 
persist
, even banks that rely 
predominantly 
on 
deposit funding 
eventually
 pass the interest rate reduction
 on to at least part of their 
deposit base, namely corporate deposits and large retail deposits. 
However, some 
degree of downward rigidity in retail deposit rates remains, limiting the scope for 
further improvements in fund
ing costs without changes to the funding structure.

. Moreover
, there are additional channels that strengthen the transmission of 
negative rates compared to a standard rate cut, especially when the latter 
occurs close to the perceived ﬁlower boundﬂ.
84 First, n
egative interest rates remove the non
-negativity restrictio
n on current 
and future expected short
-term
 rates and
, therefore,
 monetary accommodation 
can 
propagate 
throughout
 the yield curve.
 Before June 2014 the distribution of 
future expected short
-term
 rates was 
effectively 
truncated at zero
, as market 
participan
ts were not assigning significant probability to future rates being negative
. The introduction of n
egative policy rates allowed the constellation of rates to expand 
into negative territory. As the
 expansion of the interest rate distribution on the negative
 side affects not only current rates but also expected future rates, 
the stimulus 
also 
propagates 
to longer maturities (
see
 Box 1
). Second, NIRP
 increases investor demand for longer
-dated assets, exerting 
further downward pressure on the term premium.
 The negative 
remuneration of 
excess liquidity and 
its 
transmission to 
short
-term interest rates create incentives
 for 
investors to 
rebalance their portfolios towards 
assets
 with longer maturities, 
increas
ing
 the demand for these securities relative to thei
r supply. 
While this compression in 
yields of longer
-dated assets also occurs following policy rate cuts in positive territory, 
it becomes more prominent when rates are below zero, as some investors are 
particularly averse to accepting negative nominal ret
urns, for instance because they

 Negative rates and the transmission of monetary policy
  64 are committed to providing positive nominal returns to their final beneficiaries. 
This 
ultimately exerts extra downward pressure on the term premium.
 Third, c
ommercial banks are encouraged to expand lending to 
avoid
 negative
 interest on their holdings of 
excess liquidity.
 Banks face a direct charge on their 
excess liquidity
, which exerts pressure on their profitability, particularly as the 
remuneration of their liabilities is, in part, bounded at zero. They
 can avoid
 this cha
rge
 by rebalancing their 
portfolios 
in favour of credit expansion or 
by 
purchasing 
securities
.85 In fact, returns on all liquid assets in banks™ portfolios drop relative to 
loans, providing them with a strong incentive to rebalance in favour of credit 
origi
nation.
86 At the same time, negative rates 
also 
entail frictions that may hinder the 
transmission of monetary policy via banks.
 Banknotes 
yield a zero nominal return, 
so, if deposits carry negative nominal interest rates, depositors may at some point 
resort
 to cash hoarding as a way to avoid them. This implies that retail deposit rates, 
which are quite responsive downwards when policy rates adjust in positive territory, 
become much stickier. As the returns on the assets held by banks are not subject to 
the s
ame downward stickiness, this results in a compression of banks™ interest 
margins, which applies pressure on bank profitability. Moreover, banks tend to hold 
assets with relatively long durations, which reprice more slowly than their liabilities, so 
protra
cted periods of negative rates may dent banks™ net worth and thereby impair the 
bank
-based transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Moreover, the pressure to 
maintain intermediation margins and to move away from less risky liquid assets 
provides banks wi
th an incentive to increase their risk tolerance, which may eventually 
lead to excessive risk
-taking.
87 More generally, i
nvestors (banks and non
-banks) 
might 
hoard cash rather than 
rebalance their portfolios towards longer
-term or riskier assets, although t
here 
are no strong signals of such
 a ﬁleakage
ﬂ. To the extent that cash and deposits are 
perfect substitutes, 
agents would respond to negative interest rates on deposits by 
holding cash, implying an effective lower bound of zero for interest rates
. However
, in 
practice they are not perfect substitutes. In fact, deposits 
have several
 advantages,
 such as being a more eff
icient
 means of stor
ing value 
and 
conducting 
payment
s. This 
convenience has an i
ntrinsic monetary value. So far, there 
is no evidence of 
large
-scale shifts into cash among depositors such as 
households
, corporates
 or 
non
-bank financial institution
s (see 
Chart 
2, panel a
). Banks themselves may, in 
principle, also use their holdings of excess reserves with the central bank t
o acquire 
                                        
                           
 85  The banking system as a whole cannot reduce excess liquidity by expanding
 credit or acquiring 
securities, as such transactions merely shift liquidity from one bank to another within the closed system in 
which it can circulate. Nevertheless, individual banks can engineer a reduction in their own excess 
liquidity position in this
 way.

. 87  More generally, there may also be in
centives for non
-banks to embark on excessive risk
-taking. For 
example, several investment and pension funds are committed to paying out at least the nominal amount 
of initial contributions. NIRP reduces the return that can be obtained for a certain level 
of risk, forcing 
these intermediaries either to accept lower profitability or to invest in riskier assets in search of higher 
returns.

 Retail deposit
s tend not to 
carry
 negative rates
, either 
because of legislative 
hurdles and 
litigation risks or concerns about deposit withdrawals
. Legislators 
and courts have so far maintained a legal framework that poses a series of legal 
constraints and litigation risks related to the application of negative deposit rates. 
These vary from country to country and according to the 
sector
 of the deposi
tor
 and 
are also dependent on whether they would apply to
 new or 
existing contracts. 
However, i
n the majority of euro area countries
, the transmission of negative rates to 
corporate
 deposits is not subject to legal constraints and is 
indeed
 a relatively 
widespread phenomenon
 which has been increasing over time (see Chart 3)
.88 Moreover, 
fees and commissions
 can lead to an effective negative nominal return on 
deposits, even if they do not carry a negative interest rate
. Nonetheless
, there is no 
evidence that
, as 
the remuneration of
 retail deposits passed the zero line
, banks 
experienced 
significant 
outflows of deposits. 
This suggests that, until it reaches a level 
that exceeds the cost of hoarding cash, a
 negative nominal rate would 
only 
generate a 
change in 
behaviour 
among 
retail deposit
ors as a result of some form of money 
illusion or other behavioural bias.

The composite indicator is computed by taking

 complement and reinforce the 
transmission of NIRP.
 Asset purchases increase 
the volume of 
excess liquidity
 in the 
banking sy
stem
, strengthening the pressure 
on 
individual banks to shift their excess 
liquidity to other banks by acquiring assets. Forward guidance reduces uncertainty 
about the future path of 
interest rates
. TLTROs ensure that banks can obtain funding 
at very low i
nterest rates
 (as low as the DFR)
 and help to channel the resulting 
reduction
 in funding costs towards new lending 
to firms and households (
other than 
for 
house purchases
). The two
-tier system for reserve remuneration allows the 
accommodative effects of NI
RP to be maintained while mitigating the downward 
pressure on bank profitability stemming from the negative remuneration of excess 
liquidity holdings.

  67 rates, a key benchmark 
for 
long
-term risk
-free rates in the euro area, declined by around 130 
basis 
points
 over the same period, i.e. exceeding the decline at the short end of the curve. Investment 
grade corporate bond yi
elds of non
-financial corporations 
(NFCs) 
decreased by roughly 120 
basis 
points
, while euro area equity prices increased by close to 25%.
 Bond yields across maturities have been influenced by a host of other factors besides changes in 
current and expected ECB policy rates. For instance, long
-term rates also incorporate risk premia
, which 
in turn depend on a 
number of factors
, such as other p
olicy measures (including asset 
purchases) 
and
 global risk factors.
91 In order to estimate the yield curve impact stemming purely from 
negative interest rate policy (NIRP), a counterfactual 
ﬁno-NIRP
ﬂ scenario has been constructed 
in 
which both current and e
xpected future short
-term rates are prevented 
from going 
below zero. 
Specifically, at any horizon, the option
-implied risk
-neutral density of future short
-term rates is cut at 
zero from below and the probability mass that markets assigned to sub
-zero rates
 is re
-attributed to 
the zero lower bound. Such counterfactual rate distributions can be skewed to the upside
, inducing a 
tightening bias in the corresponding forward curve. The difference between forward rates in such a 
hypothetical non
-negative
-rate 
scen
ario 
and observed rates is taken as the impact of negative policy 
rates. A 
Bayesian vector autoregression (
BVAR
) model has been used to translate the derived impact 
on the forward curve into the full yield curve impact.
92 NIRP is estimated to have compresse
d two
-year and ten
-year 
sovereign bond yields
 by around 40
 basis points 
and 
35 basis points
, respectively, by the end of 2019
 (see 
Chart A
). In contrast to 
estimates of standard policy rate cuts in positive territory, the impact on longer maturities is 
com
parably large relative to the impact on the short end of the curve. This pattern is also visible
 when 
looking at changes in the yield curve in response to surprise 
policy rate cuts 
(shocks) 
averaged over 
several events
; while the impact 
of a standard 
rate 
cut diminish
es relatively quickly
 across maturit
ies
, it is more pronounced for rate cuts to negative levels.

A Estimated impact of negative interest rate policy on the sovereign yield curve
 (percentage points)
 Source: Updated figures 
for 
Rostagno
, M. et al. op. cit.
 Note
: The chart illustrates the impact of NIRP on sovereign yields (weighted average of 
German, French, Italian and Spanish sovereign bond yields
), which 
works primarily via the short
-term rate and the OIS forward curve.
 One of the 
reas
ons for 
the 
different 
ﬁfootprints
ﬂ of policy innovations
 is that
 yield
-seeking
 investors 
may 
be more strongly incentivised to climb up the maturity ladder if shorter
-term assets are pushed 
into more negative yields. 
Rate cuts 
to 
below zero and the ensuing 
ECB communication
s have 
typically been understood by investors as indicating an extended scope for rate cuts in the future. 
Market participants™ perceived distribution of future policy rates thus extends 
further 
into negative 
territory, which decreases rat
e expectations and thereby compresses long
-term rates.
94 The NIRP
-induced decrease 
in 
risk
-free rates had a direct effect on risky asset prices, leading 
Œ all 
else being equal 
Œ to increase
s in stock prices and decreases in corporate and sovereign bond yiel
ds. 
Employing a dividend discount model to dissect the drivers of stock price changes between early 
June 2014 and 
the 
end
 of 
2019 suggests that roughly 
half 
of the total increase in stock prices 
was 
due 
to decreases in the risk
-free component of the discou
nt rate (see Chart 
B).95 The impact o
f NIRP 
Œ identified via the yield curve analysis described above 
Œ is 
estimated 
to account for 
somewhat more 
than one
-fifth
 of 
this
, i.e. contributing around 
3 percentage points to the overall stock price increase. 
This 
figure is probably a lower bound for the overall contribution of NIRP to stock price
 changes,
 as 
the
 stimulating effect 
of this policy measure 
on the economy (see 
Section 
4) is likely to have raised 
earnings expectations 
and might have
 decreased the equity
 risk 
premium via confidence effects. At 
the same time, 
in the period from June 2014 to the end of 2019, 
the equity 
risk 
premium 
increased
 overall, constituting a drag on equity prices
. Thus
, even if NIRP
 itself
 has 
had a 
positive 
effect 
on 
equity premia, 
equity valuations
 relative to those of risk
-free rates do not appear 
to be more stretched 
compared to their pre
-NIRP levels.

 Similarly

an improved macro
economic
 outlook and risk perceptions may 
have compressed yields further via lower
ed spreads and risk premia.

  3 Impact on bank profitability
 and risk
-taking
 Euro area bank profitability has gradually recovered from the significant 
decline that followed the crisis
, but remains low by historical standards
 (see 
Chart 4)
. Bank profitability 
showed an
 upwar
d trend in the run
-up to the financial crisis, 
followed by a decline
, which was
 largely driven by a sharp increase in loan loss 
provisions. 
Since 2012
, bank profitability has gradually recovered
, as
 loan loss 
provisions
 have decreased and net interest inco
me has remained broadly stable
. Nevertheless, t
he return on equity stood 
at 
around 6% in 
the third quarter of 
2019, 
which is below 
most estimates of 
the cost of equity

 Negative rates and the tra
nsmission of monetary policy
  71 significant 
reduction in rates at
 the longer end of 
the 
term structure than a conventional 
policy rate cut (
see Box 1). Since banks typically engage in maturity transformation, 
obtaining funding at shorter maturities 
and durations 
than those at which they lend, 
this contributes to an additional squeeze 
on 
net in
terest margins compared to a 
rate 
cut in a positive interest rate environment. However, there are also channels through 
which NIRP supports bank profits, in particular through its impact on asset valuations 
and, more importantly, on the macroeconomy.
98 The 
positive impact of the policy on 
macroeconomic conditions leads to higher intermediation volumes, supporting net 
interest income. Moreover, the improved economic outlook and the lower level of 
interest rates 
boost 
borrower creditworthiness, reducing costs 
stemming from loan 
loss provisions. At the same time, 
decreases in
 yields driven by NIRP
 are reflected in 
an 
increase 
in 
the value of the securities held by banks
, thereby leading to (temporary) 
capital gains 
for banks.
 The main component of bank profitability, net interest income, has so far 
remained rather resilient, as 
larger intermediation volumes
 have offset the 
lower margins
. Chart 5 shows that the decrease in income on loans and securities 
has been offset by lower 
interest expenses on deposits and debt securities issued, 
based on actual developments in interest rates and volumes. In the chart, these 
movements are represented by the red circles. The developments are further 
decomposed into price and quantity effects 
(yellow and blue bars). These show that 
the negative impact of lower interest rates on the income from loans has been partly 
offset by higher intermediation volumes. The negative quantity effect on debt 
securities reflects banks™ portfolio rebalancing towa
rds loans. Analogously, on the 
liability side, the liquidity injected by the APP led to an increase in deposits by the 
money holding sector, thereby increasing the relevance of this funding source for 
banks. At the same time, lower interest rates on deposi
ts and debt securities issued 
supported net interest income.

 Notes:
 The sample is balanced (covering 194 eu
ro area banks) and adjusted for 
major 
mergers and acquisitions. Interest expenses are 
inverted, so decreases in costs are shown as pos
itive contributions to profits.
 To comprehensively assess the impact of NIRP on bank profitability, it is crucial 
to look 
at components beyond net interest income and to take into account the 
impact of the policy on the broader economy
. As discussed 
above, one would 
expect, all else being equal, that lower and, in particular, negative interest rates would 
lead to a decline in
 banks™ net interest margins, and indeed several empirical studies 
highlight this relationship.
99 However, the overall impact on bank profitability depends 
not only on developments in net interest margins but also on the macroeconomic 
outlook, which affects
 credit demand and borrower creditworthiness and therefore 
intermediation volumes and loan loss provisions. Therefore, a comprehensive 
assessment of the impact of low or negative interest rates on bank profitability requires 
consideration not only of devel
opments in interest rates but also of the impact of 
monetary policy on economic activity.
 Negative interest rates have had a broadly neutral 
impact 
on bank profitability 
so far, as their negative 
effect
 on net interest income 
has been 
offset by 
a positive 
effect
 on borrower creditworthiness.
 Chart 6 reports 
the results of a 
comprehensive assessment of the impact of NIRP on bank profitability. The exercise 
was conducted by comparing actual developments in the main components of bank 
profitability in the peri
od during which NIRP has been in place with those under a 
counterfactual scenario in which NIRP was not implemented. 
This scenario is obtained 
from 
the simulation of 
a BVAR model 
under the assumption that 
the 
zero lower bound
 would be enforced at all times, 
thereby
 preventing the term structure 
of interest rates

.100 Under this scenario, higher 
interest rates would have been reflected in weaker loan growth and lower borrower 
cre
ditworthiness and therefore in higher loan loss provisions. Actual developments in 
bank profitability components (red circles) can therefore be decomposed into a part 
that represents the estimated impact of NIRP (yellow bars) and one which would have 
been 
observed under the counterfactual scenario (blue bars). In line with the frictions 
highlighted above, the estimated impact of NIRP on net interest income is negative.
101 The direct cost 
of remunerating 
banks™ holdings of excess liquidity 
at the negative DFR 
is shown as a separate component and, overall, is limited. The chart also illustrates 
the positive impact of negative interest rates on non
-interest income. This effect is 
relatively small and short
-lived, as it mainly reflects the impact of decreases in 
interest 
rates 
on 
the value of the securities held by banks
. More importantly, NIRP is estimated 
to have accounted for a significant share of the observed decline in loan loss 
provisions. Overall, taking all effects into account, NIRP is estimated to have h
ad a negligible impact on bank profitability
 up to now.

 Negative rates and the transmission of monetary policy
  74 macroeconomic model similar to that described above. The results 
indicate that
, while 
NIRP 
has a more negative impact on 
the 
net interest margins
 of retail banks 
Œ those 
relying more on retail deposits
 Œ the 
same 
banks also 
benefit 
more 
from
 the improved 
credit quality and intermediation volumes 
that are 
linked to the p
ositive impact of 
monetary accommodation on the macro
economic
 outlook.
 Looking ahead, the balance 
between costs and benefits may
 evolve
 if interest 
rates remain low for a long period of time.
 The 
detrimental impact on net interest 
margins is likely to be m
ore significant as rates remain low for longer.
102 This is 
because b
anks are still benefiting 
from income on fixed
-rate loans originated when 
interest rates were higher, and this income will progressively decrease as legacy loans 
mature.
103 Moreover, the scope
 for further savings in provisions and funding costs is 
limited, in particular for banks whose loan portfolio is concentrated on low
-risk 
borrowers. The cost for banks of holding excess reserves also increased following the 
cut in the DFR in September 2019
 and the increase in excess liquidity driven by the 
reactivation of the APP, but these effects are mitigated by the introduction of the 
two
-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves (see also Box 2).
 While
 the compression 
of 
intermediation margin
s can lead to an increase in the 
riskiness of 
bank
 portfolios
, so far there is limited evidence that such an 
increase has been excessive
. Banks may 
be more willing to raise the risk profile of 
their investments in the aftermath of NIRP in a search for high
er yields
.104 Whether 
this riskiness 
can
 be deemed excessive depends on whether it is adequately priced 
in 
in the terms and conditions of new loans and
, even more importantly
, on whether it is 
factored in 
in 
credit standards. 
Evidence from
 the euro area 
bank
 lending survey (BLS) 
shows that the easing of margins on riskier loans has been much more contained than 
that on average loans, and, over the last year, margins on riskier loans have actually 
been tightening.
105 Moreover, model
-based 
evidence suggests that 
the increase in 
the risk profile of portfolios has been adequately reflected in lending rates
, although 
some sectors, like consumer lending, have started to show signs of exuberance
.106 Regulatory pressures and supervisory oversight have played
, and continue
 to play
, a crucial role in fostering a balanced coexistence 
between
 negative rates 
and
 prudent 
loan pricing practices.

 Box 
2 The transmission of negative interest rates in euro area money markets
 Prepared by Nick Ligthart 
and Julian Schumacher
 Short
-term interest rates in euro area money markets play a crucial role in the monetary policy 
transmission process
, by serving as 
the main reference point
s for banks when pricing loans to firms 
and households. Effective monetary pol
icy transmission 
therefore 
requires changes in the ECB™s key 
interest rates 
to be 
closely followed by 
developments in 
money market rates.
 Ultimately
, the market 
rates that matter most for the pricing of bank loans vary with unsecured overnight rates
, such 
as 
the 
euro overnight index average (
EONIA
) or 
the euro short
-term rate (
•STR
).111 The supply of central bank reserves available in the banking system determines which of the ECB™s 
key interest rates anchors short
-term rates (
see 
Chart A). This relationship 
also holds
 in 
a negative 
interest rate environment
. If the central bank provides sufficient reserves to just match the 
demand in 
the 
banking system arising from reserve requirements and autonomous factors
, market participants 
tend to price the cost of over
night funding close to the interest rate on the MRO.
112 In an environment 
of excess liquidity, 
however, overnight rates are grounded by 
the DFR. 
When the ECB began its 
negative interest rate policy by reducing the DFR to below zero i
n June 
2014, excess liqui
dity
 was
 already 
elevated compared 
with
 pre
-crisis levels
, at around •200 billion.
 Consequently, 
short
-term 
rates hovered between the DFR and the MRO rate.

 The ECB™s negative interest rate policy has been smoothly transmitted to 
short

(see 
Chart 
A).

around 
-0.45%, 
roug
hly

113 It has thus

-through of the initial DFR c
uts below zero in June and September 2014 p
robably 
reflected 
operational adjustment costs 
of 
market participants in the new negative interest rate
 environment
, as well as frictions 
in 
the distribution of excess liquidity across the euro area.
114 In 
contrast, 
subsequent reductions 
in 
the DFR
, which ha
ve taken place in an environment of high 
excess liquidity, 
have been followed 
promptly 
by short

 113  The EONIA was

 Turnover in selected money market segments
 (EUR trillions)
 Sources: ECB Euro Money Market Survey (until 
Q2 
2015) and money 
market statistical reporting (MMSR
) (as of 
Q3 
2016).
 Note: The 
vertical broken line indicates 
when the collection of MMSR data started (Q3 2016). 
Latest observations: 
Q4 
2019. The excess liquidity generated by the ECB™s non
-standard measures has reduced 
demand from 
banks for short
-term liquidity 
in money markets, which in turn has led to some 
money market 
benchmark rates falling 
below
 the DFR. This reflects 
the fact 
that euro area banks have the outside 
option of placing their excess liquidity 
in 
the deposi
t facility instead of lending it in the market (
see 
Chart B).
115 As a result, unsecured interbank rates 
(such as, historically, the 
EONIA
) are based on 
increasingly low trading volumes, but have remained above the DFR. 
At the same time
, the APP has 
also plac
ed large amounts of liquidity in the hands of non
-banks and banks located outside the euro 
area, 
which
 do not have access to the ECB™s deposit facility. These market participants need to resort 
to euro area money markets for liquidity storage purposes. Imp
ortant benchmark rates reflecting such 
a broader spectrum of market participants 
Œ such as 
the 
•STR 
Œ are therefore largely dominated by 
the 
deposit
-taking 
of 
euro area banks
. These benchmark rates
 have declined 
to 
below the DFR
, as 
banks with abundant res
erves charge a spread to accept additional deposits
. For similar reasons, 
certain repurchase agreement (repo) rates are also hovering below the DFR.
 While general collateral 
repo rates reflecting cash funding costs have remained relatively tightly linked t
o the level of the DFR, 
repo rates for specific collateral 
have occasionally dropped 
significantly lower
, reflecting market 
participants™ search for specific bonds
.116                                         
                           
 115  The drop in demand 
has been 
driven by 
post
-crisis regulat
ions
, which have increased the regulatory cost 
of unsecured trading activity,
 possibly exacerbated by residual market fragmentation along national 
borders
. 116  Repo trades can be cash
-driven (initiated to borrow cash in exchange for collateral) or security
-driven 
(initiated to temporarily 
ﬁborrow
ﬂ specific 
securities that are offered as 
collateral
 in exchange for lending 
cash
). As 
market participants search
 for specific collateral, 
some 
issuer
-specific and even broad general 
collateral baskets have 
traded
 below the DFR. 
In
 a reaction to these developments
, the Eurosystem 
enhanced its securities lending facility by accepting cash collateral from December 2016, mitigating 
some of the pres
sure on euro area repo markets.

 In September 2019 the ECB decided to introduce a two
-tier system for the remunerat
ion of excess 
liquidity holdings 
to support the bank
-based transmission of monetary policy
. The initial experience 
with th
is system suggests that sufficient excess liquidity remains subject to the DFR to ensure a 
continued effective transmission of negativ
e policy rates in euro area money markets.
117 Under the 
two
-tier system, 
parts of credit institutions™ excess liquidity holdings with the Eurosystem are 
currently 
remunerated at 0% instead of at the DFR. 
This provides incentives for banks holding less excess 
liquidity than their exempt allowance to borrow additional reserves at any rate below 
0% 
and deposit 
them with the central bank at a profit. 
Banks that had unused allowances before the introduction of 
the 
two
-tier system 
have therefore 
substantially increased 
their money market borrowing activity 
in the 
secured segment (
see 
Chart C, left panel). At the same time, 
the 
borrowing activity 
of 
banks in the 
unsecured segment 
remained limited and mostly confin
ed to specific domestic money markets. 
Accordingly, while repo rates have experienced limited and temporary upward pressure due to the 
increased trading activity (
see 
Chart C, right panel), unsecured benchmark rates have remained 
largely unchanged. 
The two
-tier system has 
thus 
partially revived demand for reserves, but money 
market rates have remained broadly stable and closely anchored to the DFR.

 117  In September 2019 t
he Governing Council
 decided to introduce a two
-tier reserve remuneration system 
to support the bank
-based transmission of monetary policy. 
The system has been implemented since 30 
October 2019.

 Negative rates and the transmission of monetary policy
  79 4 Impact on the broader economy
 The overall impact of 
NIRP 
on loan growth derives from both the funding cost
 relief granted by the policy rate cut and the non
-standard channels activated 
when rates move into negative territory.
 As is also 
the case with standard rate cuts, 
NIRP exerts an easing 
effect 
which operates through the bank lending channel of 
monetary po
licy transmission and stems
 primarily from a
 reduction in bank 
funding 
cost
s. This first
-order effect
, however,
 may differ in magnitude 
from that of 
a policy rate 
cut in 
positive territory since, as explained above, negative rates give rise to some 
specifi
c frictions
, while also activating
 additional channels
, which
 can result in 
a multiplication of the stimulus provided by the monetary policy accommodation, 
especially as regards loan creation.
 The compression in funding costs not related to retail deposits
 activated a bank 
lending channel that accounted for an expansion of aggregate corporate 
loan 
growth by around 
0.4
 percentage
 points.
 Funding 
options for banks include not 
only deposits of households and firms but also debt securities, Eurosystem
 funding, 
deposits of other financial institutions and governments, money market funds and 
external liabilities. Even under the conservative assumption that all deposits of the 
non
-financial private sector, irrespective of their size,
 are bound at zero, th
e sum of all 
these funds still leaves around two
-thirds of funding sources that can be remunerated 
at rates below zero. According to past regularities, this
 funding cost relief would have 
stimulated loan growth by around 0.4 percentage points on average, a
s envisaged 
under 
a standard bank lending channel
 of propagation to the broader economy.
119 It is 
important to note that this is a conservative estimate, not only because deposit rates 
actually declined by 0.6 percentage points but also because it abstracts 
from the 
compression of risk and term premia.
120 A review
 of 
available empirical studies
 suggests that non
-standard channels 
support aggregate loan supply, leading to an additional increase in annual 
corporate loan growth
 of around 0.3 percentage points
 (see Chart 
7). Negative 
interest rates exert pressure on the intermediation margins of banks that rely more on 
retail deposits, leading healthier banks to 
expand
 the
ir loan supply
 or to 
try and 
maintain 
profitability via search
-for
-yield.
121 Conversely, weaker b
anks 
with limited 
capacity to expand credit supply
 or increase risk may 
keep lending rates unchanged or 
even 
be forced to 
increase them
. This has been referred to in the economic literature

123 For each study

have emerged if the ECB had not adopted NIRP in 2014. We then order 
these 
counterfactuals depending on the resulting loan growth, and report their median (the 
dashed black line in Chart 7) and their overall range (grey area), spanning values from 
just above the actual loan growth (blue line) to well below it. In the absenc
e of NIRP, 
loan growth for banks negatively affected by the policy (
related to the income loss 
implied by the hard bound on retail deposit rates
) would have been
 0.3 percentage 
points higher than the observed loan growth. At the same time,
 loan growth
 woul
d have been substantially lower for banks 
whose lending was 
positively affected by the 
policy (
-0.5 percentage points each year being the median across studies, with 
estimates as low as 
-1.6 percentage points at the bottom of the range)
. Taking into 
accoun
t the whole set of available empirical analyses, the counterfactual loan growth 
in the absence of NIRP would have been lower by around 0.3 percentage points each 
year.

 Overall,
 empirical evidence points to a positive impact of NIRP on loan growth

Responses refer to

et percentage 
is the per
centage of banks reporting a positive impact minus the percentage of banks reporting 
a negative impact. Figures at the country level are weighted by volume of loans to obtain aggregate figures for the euro area
. Latest 
observation: O
ctober 2019.
 Negative rates, in conjunction with the other policy measures, have contributed 
to the euro area expansion and supported inflation expectations
. According to 
estimates carried out by Eurosystem staff, at the end of 2019 the level
 of real GDP 
was between 2.5 and 3.0 percentage points higher than it would have been in 
the 
absence 
of the 
unconventional 
measures 
that 
the ECB 
has taken 
since 
the middle of 
2014. The 
policy 
contribution to 
the 
euro area inflation 
rate 
is estimated to 
have been on aver
age 
between 
one
-third and one
-half of a 
percentage point 
per year 
until 2019.
 Identifying 
the contribution of each individual instrument is difficult because of the interaction 
among these policy tools (a feature that has often prompted the ECB to combine 
them 
in a policy package). However, one tentative 
way to isolate the contribution of 
NIRP 
is 
to run its estimated yield 
impact
, as 
documented in Box 1
, through macroeconomic 
models. These estimates suggest that around one
-sixth of the overall 
cumulated 
impact on 
GDP 
growth is attributable to NIRP as a stand
-alone instrument
. This 
represents a tangible contribution, considering 
the 
overall limited 
rate adjustments in 
negative territory.
125 NIRP is found to explain a similar share of the overall policy effec
t on inflation. As acknowledged above, these estimates provide a conservative 
assessment of the contribution of NIRP, which is reinforced by its complementarity 
with other monetary policy tools.
 There are reasons to believe that the 
impact on the broader 
econom
y goes 
beyond the transmission via bank lending
. Additional channels emerge or are 
strengthened as the policy rate moves deep
er into negative territory. One example is 
the effect of NIRP o
n the remuneration of liquid assets 
in which 
the 
corporate 
sect
or usually invests
. NIRP 
compresses the remuneration of 
liquid assets
, and is passed on 
to corporate deposits as
 policy rates move deeper into negative territory and 
expectations of a future rate hike move further in
to the future
. Using information

  5 Concluding remarks
 The stimulus to the broader economy provided by 
NIRP has been effective
 in 
inducing
 an e
asing of financing conditions and 
thereby, 
ultimately
, contribut
ing
 to price stability.
 The interest rate cut has been channelled through both standard 
and non
-standard 
transmission mechanisms
, generating a 
reduction in bank 
funding 
cost
s and spurring loan creation. Effects were heterogeneous across bank 
characteristics
. However, 
the dispersion in some bank responses 
does not challenge
 the 
overall positive 
first
-order effect 
of NIRP 
on financing conditions. 
Notwithstanding 
the potential he
adwinds to transmission discussed above, as yet t
here is no sign 
that 
the stimulus provided by the measure
 has been exhausted
, as new channels emerge

  84 while others fade away. 
Ultimately, t
he macroeconomic response 
has been 
siz
eable 
and 
has 
helped to bring i
nflation closer to the ECB
™s aim.
 Protracted periods of negative rates 
do, however,
 have the potential to hinder 
the transmission of monetary policy
. Prolonged periods of negative rates are 
qualitatively different from brief, ﬁexperimentalﬂ periods. If neg
ative policy rates had 
proved to be short
-lived, they might have become a mere footnote in central banking 
history. As negative rates persist, however, banks react to them to avoid the negative 
effects on profitability, although their leeway to do so is er
oded over time. In the current 
euro area monetary policy environment, the effects of a long period of negative rates 
require continuous and careful monitoring as we venture further into uncharted 
territory.
 Overall, NIRP still largely
 benefits the macroeco
nomic outlook and price 
stab
ility.
 In order to support the bank
-based transmission of monetary policy, the ECB 
has adopted a two
-tier system for reserve remuneration. In parallel, specific risks to 
financial stability are addressed by action from other pol
icy areas, which are 
specifically mandated to tackle phenomena and behaviours associated with such 
risks. Microprudential supervision monitors banks™ risk
-taking behaviour, and so far it 
has provided an adequate set of incentives for intermediaries to cali
brate their risk 
attitude to the macroeconomic circumstances. Moreover, national and supranational 
macroprudential authorities can effectively monitor and respond to localised house 
price bubbles and other threats to financial stability. Such mitigating ac
tion allows the 
euro area economy to continue to benefit from the significant and necessary 
stimulative impact of NIRP, which has proven to be an integral and effective part of the 
ECB™s policy response to past and current challenges.
